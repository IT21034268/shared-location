2,Not what I was expecting,"I bought this book to learn how to use menconder under linux (ubuntu), but only two pages were about this topic and with no hacks, just a few known commands that couldn't help me.It's a good book for the price you pay, but I think is just for people who is new in Linux.If anybody can recommend a good book for ""advanced"" mencoder I'll be glad to buy it.Thank you."
3,basketball in ground hoop,one of the worst ideas i have had. plastic support sleeve pop opened during placement in wet cement pole got stuck. got it unstuck days later. plastic sleeve still open on bottom made for a loose fit once i completed pole setup. by the way section of pole arrived bent backboard was (is) warped. every step was a large task. parts missing. will never do this again.
4,"Good for art lovers, slightly deficient for a philosopher.","The entries have very good brief historical and religious background. It just failed to show the gradual deterioration of art, in general, and of painting in particular from the time of the Rennaisance to modern times. The entries for modern art were very charitable; the attempt to be sacramental in the descriptions was futile because there was nothing sacramental in most modern art. But the attempt was well-intentioned and acceptable to most reader but it would be disappointing to the theologian.(But the book was not meant for theologians but for artists.) In which case the artist should give it 4 and a half-stars."
2,Great - Until the Battery Dies...,"We installed this unit a couple of years ago. I noticed (during a torrential thunderstorm), that our sprinklers were still running. I went and checked the sensor - battery is dead. I look to change battery - sealed. No user serviceable parts. I mean come on, they can't make it so you can change what is probably a two dollar battery?Quite expensive for a disposable product..."
4,Only 4 stars,"Shipped very fast, received in 3 days. Good quality product was hooked and working in 15 minutes.Product description doesn't say it comes with rubber cover for outdoor mounting of control box, a plus.Only negative, if you want the gutter attachment, it's seperate. A $2 part with extra $5 shipping and handling! Other sensors come with that attachment and others."
4,A good set. A little pricey.,"No complaints from this no-frills ""Made in Italy"" cookware set. Handles stay cool, cooking seems to be even with all meals I've prepared. Cleanup is a snap and they have an attractive design. Be sure to check out the customer images. I took a few photos and added them to the customer gallery.Only four stars because of the price. Bialetti's Commercial line can be found on Amazon for only a few bucks more -> Bialetti 07107 commercial quality 10-piece cookware set."
5,Climb On,I Love this book so did my entire school everyone in my FBLA group bought it and the bus was completly quiet because no one could put it down!
4,Personal Efficiency & Self Help,"Although this is an old book, it is well written and straight to the point. I recommend it to anyone willing to be self critical in order to improve their self. It has helped provide guidance to me on weak areas that I need to improve on in order to improve my work and personal success. Also, it is a great book that provides historical insight into how American industriousness and hard work in the early 1900's. The book covers the following important topics:ThinkSelf EducationIdealsWorkSavingOpportunitySelf DenialStick-To-ItivenessCheerfulnessTeam WorkPolitenessInitiativeHonestyHealthLanguageEnthusiasmGoodwillWill PowerSelf RespectJudgementFriendsCourageSelf RelianceServePersonalityFoundationsLoyaltyMemoryRecreation"
4,"Useful, but could be better","The plus side: This book is what it says it is. An adequate guide to identifying the water creatures you'll see in the water near Hawaii. It has very broad coverage for the size, and packs a lot of information. On the negative side, the book is very small-format, which means it is convenient to take on the boat or in a fanny pack. But it could be improved by making the page and binding more waterproof--It won't last long on a boat. And the small format means that it is unsatisfactory for casual reading at home before or after a trip--The photographs are postage stamp-sized, and the descriptive text is VERY brief. Finally, the book has dual Japanese and English texts. This shouldn't bother me, but for some reason it does. If nothing else, it vividly illustrates how many Japanese tourists there are in Hawaii!"
1,Don't waste your money on this one,This charger wants to fall apart each and every time that it is plugged in. I just threw it away...junk.
1,Broke during 1st use,"This item broke the first time I used it. I went to unplug it from my blackberry, and the mini-USB portion stayed with my phone. It is an extremely poorly made item from China. Save the $5 ($0.01 plus shipping) and spend it on a better quality charger."
2,Bad writing,"I agree that the writing is rather sophomoric...in case any one noticed,the author didn't even reveal what finally became of the crux of the plot, the reason for the murders, the reason Alex was killed.....WHAT HAPPENED TO THE STUPID GOLDEN COBRA????? Did I miss something? Big holes and gaps. Camille keeps going in to dinner, but never seems to eat. She always storms out...poor thing must be dying of malnutrition by the end of the book. The child Ally...we are teased with the fact at the end that she is of possible royal birth and her life may be in danger...but then that whole thing goes nowhere. Why even put that in there? Add a different scenario that at least has an answer.Several spots like that throughout the book.When I saw that Shannon Drake was Heather Graham and I remembered I had stopped reading those books after the first becausue of the bad writing."
3,Wicked by Shannon Drake,"This story of the Earl and a commoner was basically a murder who done it with love story thrown in. I did not get why the mask was needed or what it accomplished in the story. I enjoyed the characters in the story and the plot, but the rating reflects my lack of buy in to the romance and the silliness of some things like why was her Uncle going to trespass on the Earls property. Did he think that valuables were just lying around on the grounds? Why keep the place rundown and suddenly he meets our heroine and now the place is jumping with activity?Still a good read, but not a 4 or 5 star."
1,Stupid Beyond Belief,"OK, I can do Gothic if it's well-written, but this is as far from good as you can get. The heroine is a freaking idiot! Although she is a guest in the scary hero's castle (he, too, is a freaking idiot), she keeps wandering down into the crypt when she hears scary sounds, although she knows that a bad monster/guy/ghost is lurking down there doing evil. The hero is so funny it's detrimental to his manly status--he lurks around trying to convince everyone he's a beast and wears a mask shaped like a leopard or some such silly affectation. Everyone runs around like idiots wailing & moaning about some stupid golden cobra statue, several people almost die, the wrong ones recover, and then at the end the bad guy confesses all in a fit of unbelievable honesty. My personal favorite for stupid scenes is when the girl beats a bad guy with the arm she tears off a mummy and ruins it. If you read this, you are setting yourself up for either a laugh-fest or hours & hours of boredom."
1,Wicked,"This is the first book I read by Shannon Drake. I thought the book was terrible. The hero wore a leather mask and is ""rude"" through out the book. He comes across as a mean and uncaring. Also the plot was overcomplicated(there are mulitple characters that don't add to the story). I could not get into the the story and ended up reading half of it and skimming the rest."
2,SKIP IT,"I checked the date of publication on this book several times thinking that this was a reprint of one of Ms. Drake's early books. The writing is so sophomoric that, other than the sex scenes, it could have been written for teenagers (or by a teenager). Do yourself a favor and order MR. IMPOSSIBLE by LORETTA CHASE. The story takes place in Egypt and is a GREAT read. Pass on this one."
2,BORING!!!,"First I have to say that I love Shannon Drake and every one of her books have always kept me ensnared. This is the exception. I couldn't get past the third chapter. I tried and tried to get into the book, but it was impossible. She used so many exclamation points (!) that it distracted me. I didn't know if they were yelling or being extremely cheerful for no reason at all. The dialogue was horrible and the characters were not intriging. The hero wore a leather mask, which made me think ""silence of the Lambs"" and didn't endear me to him at all. I'm so dissapointed that she didn't do a better job. Her last regency romance was great, but this one needs some serious editing, and character changes. I wish that she'll give up the regency and write another medieval romance where she really shines."
3,"The cover is bad, again.","This is definitely a collectors item, but is it worth collecting? If you want Alita to last forever (which I do), then sort of. The print quality is great, like the paperbacks, but without the covers being uniform, it's almost pointless to collect them.To clarify this, I just want to let everyone know this is not about the story, art, etc, just the binding/printing.The book is the same size as the trade paperbacks are. It is in hardcover, but the pages were trimmed without the actual art being trimmed; which means some of the art gets cut off at the edges. The artwork/words also seem to sink into the middle of the book's spine (the bleed) if they get to close.I got this one with huge dings in the back. The ""action"" logo is once again missing, and smudges that cannot be removed abound."
2,Incompatibity issues,"I bought this machine to replace a Sportrak made by the same company 2 years ago. I liked the features of the unit itself: larger screen, much brighter, better battery. It's main problem is that it is not compatible with a large library of software maps (Mapsend) made by the same company that I had purchased for the Sportrak. There was no bridging software to make the images compatible. You are basically forced to buy the same maps again at a higher price. That seemed unfair to me so I returned it."
2,Magellan Explorist with no company support,"The magellan company has probably the worst customer service of any company on the planet. I bought an Explorist XL several years ago and still the company has not put out the DVD map software for it. I still have no street maps for it. If you call them they lie to you about a release date. Every time I called they would tell me it would be available in 6 weeks. They did this for a year. The story then changed to ""It would be available as a download at their web site"". That was also over a year ago. Bottom line:They sold me a gps that would never have the proper software for driving.If you e-mail them you only get an automatically generated response that tells you to call them. I finally quit calling. I do not like being lied to.My advice: Buy a Garmin or a Tom Tom. Magellan does not care about their customers. Guy"
5,Loved it!,"I LOVED this book... it was heartbreaking and sweet... I didn't expect much for the low price, but was SOOOOOO pleasantly surprised. I would love to read more by this author and will look for more books by her."
5,Loved it...Loved it...Loved it!,The story is charming. I loved the characters. I would love to read more by the author but her other books are a bit pricey for me.
5,Amazing chemistry between heroine and hero,"The first few sentences of a novel are key to catching my attention as a new reader, browsing the bookstore for a good read or a new find. This one is no exception. "" 'Come at once,' the missive said. 'Uncle Edward is dying'. Uncle Edward was ALWAYS dying."" Now I'm intrigued. Who's Uncle Edward? Who is he to Gideon Cole, the hero? I also loved the chemistry between Gideon Cole and Lily. I fell in love with both of them, one by one, and then together. Lily's younger sister is adorable. The supporting cast rounds out the story well. This is a great Pygmalion-type story for readers who love a great plot- and character-driven romance. This is my favorite of Julie Anne Long's books. Her other books The Runaway Duke, and Beauty and the Spy are not as good. A++ for To Love a Thief - a book definitely worth re-reading!"
2,to many emphasizes,"This is the second book by this author I picked up but couldn't finish. The storyline seemed interesting, but the author emphasized to many words. For me it was very distracting, especially since she emphasized a word practically every third sentence. Nobody talks like that. Sorry, but I won't pick up any more books by this author."
4,Great read!,To Love a Thief is the first book I've read by Long. It was truly funny and sexy. I laughed out loud many times. I recommend this book very highly and will now seek out more titles by this author!
4,"Very witty, engaging author. Another winner","This is my second book by Long and both were very well done. I love witty banter back and forth between characters and this book does not disappoint. Another great story woven with delightful secondary characters and plenty of action too. Engaging, scintillating and passionate. This author leaves me wanting more!"
4,"Pretty good, but not as strong at The Runaway Duke","I read this book several months ago, so my memory is a bit fuzzy,but I do remember it was worth the time spent.The hero was into having the best of everything, so at the end of the book, when he didn't marry the cream of the crop, but married his 'project' instead, I cheered!Although I liked this ""My Fair Lady"" retelling, it just didn't have the originality of ""The Runaway Duke"" and it wasn't as compelling as that book.I do look forward to see what else Julie Anne Long has in store for us in the future. So far, I'm very impressed!1-10 scale: 9.7Stars: 4 3/4"
4,The author just copied the exact same paragraphs and rewrote them in another novel.,"I like this book well but I was very dissapointed that the author just copied the two steamy escenes from this book and rewrote them in the book ""what i did for a duke"".The books are well written and different but it was like not creativity at all when she just use the exact parragraphs from one book to another in one of the most important moment of the book."
3,yoly,"well don't have much to say apart of the fact that am addicted to reading. It is a nice book in its own way but i found a lot was lacking somehow,especially towards the end, i kind of felt the author rushed to give a happy ending. Not the kind of book i will read twice."
4,Simple but Good,"An excellent book. Most books on trading will focus on setups, focusing on entry strategies, whilst skimming over aspects of stop placements, and exits. Worst still, some books will give you setups that are completely untestable with well selected examples. This book is a very thin volume. However despite that, it is one step ahead compared to most books. It actually explains the concepts and mechanics behind three trading plans in precise details. All three ideas are testable. No, they dont always work. Only trading plans with 20/20 hindight do. What it offers is more. It emphasizes the minimal elements that are necessary for anyone in constructing a good trading plan.This is of course obvious. But not obvious enough as otherwise, there wont always be a fixed population of 90% of traders who lose money every year. A good enjoyable read."
3,So Far So good,"So far, its been a good read, its my first book about technical analysis and the author is pretty good at explaining the concepts. All the charts are very useful and helps greatly with understanding"
1,Qualls,JUNK SENT THEM BACK CUSTOM MY REAR SIDE NOT EVEN CLOSE. DO NOT BUY TERRIBLE QUALTY AND FIT. I used school bus seat repair tape instead FITS GREAT.
1,picture is incorrect,"The flag is a good quality flag, however, the flag shipped is not the same as the one in the picture. The bold LIBERTY that is shown on the bottom of the flag in the picture is actually not there. Instead it says Liberty inside the crescent, which in my opinion detracts from the look of the flag as I was expecting to receive the product that was shown in the picture."
1,ViaVoice - very disappointing,"You don't get your money's worth with ViaVoice. At first, it seemed to work fine. Contrary to what the program is supposed to do, the more I used it, the worse it got. ""Training"" the software is extremely time consuming. However, I did this in hopes of improving its performance. Unfortunately, after spending all the time doing that, it was actually worse, not better. It has finally gotten so bad I cannot use the application at all. As I am dictating, it throws in random words which can't possibly have anything to do with what I am saying, some of them foreign. Dictate, ""Now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of their country,"" and you are likely to get ""Avarice now is the Bois time for all good men to Gwendolyn."" Help is impossible to find, and if you go to the IBM or ScanSoft site, you have to pay for it. Do not buy this software."
1,"This is a waste of time, effort, and money.","I bought this product to use with Microsoft Word. I can not dictate anything! What a huge disappointment. Too bad I could not rate it 0 stars. Don't even consider this product, it is fruitless to even try to get it to work at all."
1,not very good,"Takes forever to set up. About an hour to read a story so it gets use to your voice. Your suppose to be able to save the voice recognition. I had to do a complete system restore and it would not let me put the saved recognition back, so I had to read the story again.Terrible voice recognition,very frustrating to use."
2,Viavoice,I am a little disappointed in the product. When I reboot my computer then the program will not reload. In order to use it I have to reinstall the program and then I can use it. In other words it will not work if I shut down the computer for the night.
1,Via Voice,"Was suppose to work on XP, could not get to download. Got warnig of incompatable. Not happy with this product"
1,Don't bother with this one,"Maybe it was me, but I had no luck with this. My thought was that maybe a more expensive version would have worked."
4,r & b based rock performed by vetran musicans,"Veteran musicans,seldom recorded launch cd . 6 original songs by bassest Bob Cosgrove and 5 covers. Rocken stuff great for a drive down the 4 lane. Caution this will make you want to get up and dance."
5,Not for Novices...,"After Effects is a great program for creating effects for video. The best attribute that After Effects has is its ability to let you create your logo or image, etc., in PhotoShop and then import it as a composition so you can animate it. The caveat is, however, that AE is at times extremely complex, especially more so in the Production Bundles and from previous versions. AE is worth the cash and definitely worth the time to master...if you can before the next upgrade!"
1,My 27 year old vinyl sounds bettter.,"I am the proud owner of 1 Keef Hartley Band vinyl recording, ""The Time is Near."" For the last 10 years, I have been searching for a CD version of this album. I'll keep on searching, thank you.Considering the state of digital technology and the possibilities of what can be done to enhance master tapes, the people who produced this CD must have just been released from jail.The tracks are of live performances by the band from the 60's and 70's. Unless we're talking about recording using a portable Sony tape deck and a condenser mike, there is no excuse for the garage level sound and the $17.00 price tag.While I plan to leave my copy of ""The Time is Near"" to my son after I pass on, I will donate ""Not Foolish Not Wise"" to the next Public Radio or library sale -- at least I'll get tax credit for a donation.Wait for a CD reissue of the ""The Time is Near."" ""Not Foolish Not Wise"" sucks."
1,Half Full/Half Empty,"I still recall the excitement I felt two years ago in anticipation of what appeared to be a superlative compilation of some of Keef's best cuts from his distinguished, albeit underappreciated discography. Although the Keef Hartley Band deserves a box set, I felt that at least a solid compilation will suffice for those of us who loved this band for 30+ years. WRONG!!!!! What we have here is a travesty. The production values (at least in my Mooncrest CD) are an outrage. Granted, this was recorded in live performances. But, be warned. Unless you are the most hardcore of fans (and I am one too) this rip-off CD will only further exacerbate your sense of frustration that one of the greatest British Blues groups of the 60's remains the best kept secret (along with Love Sculpture) of the genre."
1,BAD BAD SOUND,"If you appreciate listening to Keef Hartley and and a fan, stay way from this one--all tracks are muffled and unclear--where did they get this one?? Poor excuse for a CD!!!!!!!!!!!!! Why did they decide to release this one--bad bad bad!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!."
5,Works Fine,Small enough to stay out of the way on my desk at work (Which I share) and works well. no problems so far.
3,Great PDA,this Handspring Visor Neo Clear is a great pda for all ganeral purpose. And is great for most of my everyday needs.Infinitely expandable with optional Springboard expansion modules
5,Rave Review,"Not just another small-block chevy rebuild book - Mavrigian really shows the differences of the gen II chevy small block. Good pictures and lots of specifics. Buy it before rebuilding your LT-1 in your 92+ vette, 93+ F-body or B- body."
4,Heavy on the machining,All in all I thought the book was excellent.Just thought it might have spent a little toomany pages on machining.Just my thoughts
3,Typical exercise video,"I am a member of the SparkPeople website and thought this video would give me much more than what it did. I was sorry to see that the ""tailoring"" of the exercises is really just video editing. Yes, you can choose how long and which workouts to do by going back and forth to the menu screen. However, each mini session is just a clip of the long session. So I wasn't really very impressed. I guess maybe my expectations were too high, but it is not much more than a typical exercise video."
4,Keeps working,"Trying to keep up ,but able to do my own speed working out. Going be a long time to get shape up."
4,Cute Shoes,"These shoes are very cute and looks great on my son, he's 12 months old so I ordered size 12 to 18 months and when I got them I thought they would never fit him but they did just that he would only get the chance to wear them for about a month or two, they were very small in size and he would never have them up to 18 months not even 13."
3,again and again....,"I love her poets when I in love someone in my mind. She let the sweet words again and again. My favorite is ""Love is"" Its simple, easy, and touching. I send this poem to my husband Robert before we married by email and he loves it. But the other poems are I don't know, tired :("
4,Great Item,I bought the 9x Tamrac bag figuring I'd have more room for my photography supplies but it only made it heavier on Rotater cuff injury. Wish I could return it for the Tamrac 5768 but I see it is too late. Otherwise a great product. Love the way it sits on my shoulder. Very large. Lots of room for lens and flash and anything else possible.
1,Don't believe the manufacturers claims,"Tamrac claims that this camera bag allows you to go from a back pack to swinging the bag to your front to unload your camera in 3 seconds. This is an outright lie. Look at the photos Tamrac uses to advertise this 3 second manuever and you will see that when the bag is on the back, it rides high between the shoulder blades. When the bag is shown in front it is riding at waist height. In order to accomplish this, you have to adjust the shoulder strap so that the bag isn't chest high when you swing it to the front. Guess what, this takes more time to do than a mere three seconds.It is a well constructed bag, but because of poor design and false claims of Tamrac, I will probably return it. It functions no better than any other waist bag. Don't waste your money on this bag thinking you will be ready to shoot faster than using a conventional bag."
2,Not a good camera bag,Not really what it was said to be hard to arrange equipment in it. I wouldn't have invested had I know how it had to be packed. But it is very well made as far as materials.
4,Two Problem,"Great bag, holds 3 lenses, one body and a flash; one 4 lenses and one body.Cons:*It seems like no bag supports storing lens hoods*The front pocket is very shallow, not much room for batteries or filters*I hate the way these Tamrac sling bags hold CF memoryPros:*Best sling bag, easily goes from back to front*The waste belt really helps distribute the weightThis is probably the best sling bag I have found that can be used without taking it off...But they certainly could make improvements"
2,Not As Good As it Looks,"I have Canon 30D with a 70-200 f/2.8 the kit lens and a 480ex. I bought this backpack from Samys camera and I am sorry that I did. It's the only thing in it's price range that will fit a 200mm lens but you can only sling it on one shoulder [you can't switch sides], it's awkward to get the camera out, and it doesn't fit me very well unless you really cinch the thing up and then it's both impossible to get off [The strap doesn't have a clip and can't be removed] and impossible to get the camera out. On the plus side it is well made and will definitely protect your gear, it will just be uncomfortable while you do it."
4,Excellent,"Great pack. I like the small pockets for memory cards and other small things. I like the quality of the product. It's barely large enough to fit a Nikon D700 with 70-200 f2.8 attached and another sizable lens with still extra room. Well built. The pack slides around even with the waist strap when doing active sports, such as snow skiing or mtn biking, so not ideal for active sports but fine for walking.I agree completely with other reviews that the main pocket needs two zippers so that it can be opened from either side/direction, as well the zipper pull needs to be much longer, as it gets obscured by the excessively large rain flap over the main pocket zipper. Overall, it's a good product but needs some minor refinement and ideally better functionality for active sports."
5,This is a great read,"I've read this book many times since the 40's and now with Google Earth I can go to the towns and battle sites for more enjoyment. One of the best first hand accounts of battle in WW1 that I have read. Like ""Storm of Steel"" there is little political comment or overall battle strategy. Just the details of one mans experience. Has a sense of humour but doesn't shrink from the horrors or the stupities or the sheer chance of who gets wounded or killed. He is proud of his abilities and acknowledges the abilities of the enemy. Makes you wish you could have known him and and listened to more of his stories."
5,VERY uniquely worth buying.,"I already owned a Sony bluetooth bidirectional receiver/transmitter for my home theater, and I made the mistake of thinking I could transport it to my car with the same end results. Not so.Because the Sony requires that it be turned on via tactile power button each time, I had to open my center console every time I started my car just to turn the thing on. With this Scosche it is no longer an issue.Furthermore, I was able to adjust the gain on this receiver the first time I used it, so that the volume level would be roughly equal to that of my FM radio.This unit has only 5% of the low-level background noise as the Sony, meaning I no longer hear my alternator whine into the speakers between tracks.Ironically, at home, the Sony picks up slightly less noise than the Scosche, although they are very similar.Definitely true AD2P high quality audio, and no problems maintaining multiple pairings with 3 different Nokia phones.I plan to buy one for each successive vehicle I buy."
2,"great concept, poor reception.","PRO: Easy to connect. Small.CON: Poor reception. Average audio quality.VERDICT: works good if the transmitter within couple of ft. Otherwise is useless.NOTES: Used as connection to home stereo.Works good within 4ft radius. If you go further than that - expect interference. Strange thing is, that when you stand or move between your transmitter and this receiver - you get interference.even though I got it for $20 from Ebay, it's barely worth it."
1,HORRIBLE,"I purchased this item two years ago. Save your money and skip it. It is garbage. It kept disconnecting every two minutes, and I had to reset everything to reconnect. I thought I had a faulty unit and got it replaced, same result. STAY AWAY."
1,Does not stay connected,"I have tried 2 of these units, and both of them would disconnect after a few minutes of use. I tried it on 3 different cell phones to stream music. (2 BlackBerrys and a LG phone)All would connect, play for 2 or 3 minutes, then disconnect. Then the Scosche unit would not want to reconnect. I had to shut it off and back on before I could get it to reconnect.Poor sound quality, very short range. Not worth the price.I have since bought theBluetooth Stereo Gateway DC800 Bluetooth Adapter for Home Stereo. That unit works about 1000 times better. It has better range, quality, and does not lose the connection. I purchased an adapter to make it work in the car too."
1,Doesn't work for streaming music from iPhone,"I bought this to stream music from my iPhone (now that it is a2dp enabled) and it does not work for this purpose. It may work for phone calls, as another reviewer stated, but if you are trying to use it for music from your iPhone (on OS 3.0) don't waste your time and money.The receiver paired with the iPhone initally - and VERY poor audio quality was heard. Eventually, the pairing was cut off and all that was heard was loud static. tried it with a couple different stereos and also streaming from my computer with the same result.This may work for some people - but if you have an iPhone and want to listen to music, stay away. I got it for less than $20 on ebay - but that's $20 wasted!"
3,Free practice test??,"This SAT study guide offers some helpful tips and many practice problems. It's smaller than other SAT study guides which makes it less intimidating than those other bulky, thick study guides. However, where is the free online pracitce exam it is suppose to include?? I tried the website, but it wasn't there!If you're serious about studying for the SATs, I suggest you try something else (yes, those other bulky study books!). I feel cheated for not having the online practice SAT exam which was also suppose to include instant essay scoring for free. Good luck on the SATs everyone!"
5,I'M SCARED TO WATCH IT!!!,I haven't seen this movie since I was a kid but it still gives me nightmares at 42! I am a horror movie fan but this one just freaked me out for my entire life! I always thought there was someone hiding in my house as a kid. I really want to see it again but I'm scared!!!
1,Bad Ronald is a bad movie,I found this movie to be awful. It was boring. The acting was bad. The movie was slow. It's not worth the money or your time. I had heard this was a good movie but it was bad and there was nothing scary about it. I expected a horror movie but it wasn't.
3,Bad Ronald,Good tv movie from 1974. About a person who has to live in a wall after accidently murdering someone. His mother then dies without him knowing. Interesting tv movie from back in the day.
2,completely average,"Boy there was alot of hype surrounding this movie, I was so excited to see it only to be left completely underwhelmed. The premise is really creepy and jacoby does a good job but the movie itself was pretty boring and never scary. passivly watchable."
3,Not so Bad Ronald,"As welcome as Buzz Kulik's seldom seen Bad Ronald is on DVD, the print quality of the disc leaves a lot to be desired. Largely seen from poor VHS quality recordings from television, this disc provides the viewer with that rare opportunity to watch the film in 'slightly' better quality than most."
4,Loved this!,"I loved this movie when it was made for TV all those years ago. It's a little implausable today, but still a good movie."
2,"Trite, even for the genre","I read this book after I read ""Love Song for a Raven,"" which is the sequel. I thought THAT book was bad, but this one was worse. Our heroine is so busy living in the past that she is unable to figure out that taking our hero on a tour of the bay does not mean she has to spend three weeks fishing with him. She's silly and he's mean. I've read better from Lowell--try the ""Only"" series."
3,"a paranoid, cynical, misogynist does not a hero make","Angel is lucky that Hawk (jeez, the idiocy of the names and metaphores!) didn't turn out to be a psychopathic killer. She trusted this guy because she saw something in his eyes? So he had an unhappy childhood, poor baby. And so his step cousin gave him a teenager's dream--all the sex he could want. And then she betrayed him. Well, why the hell didn't he get over it? You mean to say that for the next 15 years, every single woman he met was a liar and a cheat? That's the problem with contemporary romance. You have to compare it to real life, and then it sounds pretty stupid. Give me the historical romances every time, Liz, they're what you do best. And then we can pretend that maybe people really did act that way in the past."
3,Not too bad,"This is an older book by Elizabeth Lowell, and while I like her character development, and storylines, it was almost too harlequiny(is that a word?) for me. Everything turns out well, which is one of her major attractions for me, and you are taken along with the characters as they learn what makes each other tick. A good read."
2,Not Lowell's best...,"I wouldn't recommend this book. The male character is very flat. In fact, he's characterized as a jerk. Without really knowing him, the female character falls in love with him. Too fluffy and not enough content. There are plenty of really good EL books to read...leave this one out."
2,Not her best work,"This book just kept going, and going, and going. It was hard to imagine a man swearing off of any woman for something that happened to him when he was 18. Hawk finally meets this terrific lady, named Angel, everything she does he finds a fault with. He can't believe that this woman is a real warm blooded woman that cares for people. It took a long time for him to finally realize that he misunderstood her. It was just your typical romance, man and woman don't get along, the guy makes it up to the girl, then they make up. I found that the book was too long, and didn't it have a great adventure to make up for their lack of romance."
1,"If this woman uses the word ""sardonic"" again, I'll scream!","A major disappointment for Elizabeth Lowell. If you get bored with the trite plot and one-dimensional characters, just count how many times she uses the word ""sardonic."""
2,One of EL's worst...,"EL's earliest works could all be subtitled ""misogynists and the women who love them"". Hawk is the LEAST attractive character EL has ever written about. He is so completely hateful that despite his story of woe at the hands of a treacherous woman, I didn't feel at all sympathetic. So a woman used you, get over it.These characters aren't well developed, they're more caricatures than real people. No real woman looks at her man and constantly compares him to a hawk...please, what garbage!Thankfully EL's work has improved tremendously since this was published. She's given up on the misogynist as hero theme. If you want to read a great EL book try Jade Island or To the Ends of the Earth (altho the hero in the latter is a bit of a woman hater too)."
5,"Low Chronic Back Pain sufferers, MUST READ this book","This book opened my eyes to a whole new world of back pain treatment. After 15 years of chronic back pain ranging from mild to incapacitating, I was running out of options. Back bracing, ice, anti-inflamatories, and cortisone shots only left me in worse shape. After reading this book, I had a consultation for Prolotherapy. Immediate relief was forthcoming after the first treatment. After receiving 4 treatments of prolotherapy, I am 90% free of back pain.Read this book and get yourself educated in how to take charge of your back pain."
3,Prolo Your Back Pain Away,"This book had some valuable information on the subject, however, I was offended and appalled by the religious propaganda and shameless self promotion contained within. It made me wonder how helpful prolotherapy REALLY is, or if the authors are just trying to convince people to get business."
1,"First, rule out arachnoiditis","Don't go through this painful series of injections before ruling out the numerous causes of back and lower extremity pain that it simply won't touch. The prolo doctors don't turn many people away - after all, it ""might"" work! Right! This is a hundred painful shots in the dark. Sometimes it works for people, and of course they give glowing reviews. Not me. I have arachnoiditis and this type of stuff is not a good idea - maybe no direct harm, but that's not 100% clear either."
4,Excellent all round production,"The singing is the strongest plus of this production. All of the singers do a splendid job with their respective roles. The acting is undistinguished and the stage settings although adequate to create an appropriately lavish, indian setting smacked of plastic.For a 30 year old production the transfer to DVD is acceptable. Non removable English sub-titles are included as is a brief description of the plot during the orchestral prelude to each act.This is one of my favourite operas and this production has earned itself a top shelf location among my opera DVDs. I wholeheartedly recommend this DVD to anyone who has an interest in either Lakme and/or Joan Sutherland."
4,Nice DVD,"Delibes - Lakme / Joan Sutherland, Huguette Tourangeau, Henri Wilden, John Pringle, Richard Bonynge, Opera AustraliaI was going to see this opera but I wanted to get familiar with it because I only knew the ""flower duet"", I bought this DVD, it was the only one I found, but knowing that Lakme was being performed by Joan Sutherland I was sure it would be a good selection.All the cast sang very well, overstating! , but the acting that must convinced me was that of Clifford Grant as Nilakantha.Beautiful music with a wonderful orchestra director, the scenery and costumes are colorful and beautiful.The dancing in the second act was uneven.The sound was great.I am glad I've purchased this DVD, I enjoyed very much."
1,protect your children...from this book !,"My Goddess, what utter tripe! I think that Hawkins failed to think about how ancient pagan holidays were converted into the ones that they are known by today by the church (Easter and Christmas, anyone?).This is just another book released by closed-minded right-wing Christians to try to show that the Goddess and Her children are evil and ""satanic"" when these religions and ways of life existed BEFORE Christianity."
2,This book is filled with errors,I guess for anyone who wants their beliefs reiterated back to them it is a great book. Though for people who like the truth so they can think for themselves will find this book lacking. Please do not read this book if you are actually interested in actually learning about Paganism either for knowledge or interest. I would suggest something that was not made by a Christian or Pagan group but by some non-biased third party.
1,"Goddess Worship, Witchcraft and Neo-Paganism",This is the most misinformed intolerant religious right wing propaganda I have ever read. The author obviously took many assumptions about paganism and stereotyped the entire group. His arguments against it hold as little logic as he claims the pagan community uses in their own beliefs. I would strongly recommend not purchasing this book of intolerance and social hatred.
1,10 users worth of problems? NO thanks!,"Be Warned They CHARGE for Call in support now!!In my opinion; Norton used to make some great products. I used to recommend their Norton Utilities and Anti Virus programs to friends and install them on computers I assembled for them. Sadly, this has changed. They now have an online forum where you are forced to ask your questions. They may even get around to answering your question, but it takes days to get correct answers (if ever). The quality of their software has plummeted also. Several other companies make similar products that are FAR superior. Not only do I not give them a positive review, I strongly recommend you do NOT use them."
5,I luv this book!,I realized that most of the other reviews on this book say it's bad but it's not!I think those people that bad-mouthed it are weird-o's!I also can't believe taht no one else's reviews told that this is the book where they get Emily Michelle!It's really a good book so read it!
3,Okay....,"This book was okay. I mean, the text and all were good and the idea was great, but for one thing: the author treats the girls like they're adults. We know they're not. When I was, like, eight I used to think: Oh, when I'm thirteen I'll be just as adult and I'll feel really adult then. And you know what? I don't, I really don't. Martin treats the kids like they're grown up already, when really, some people aren't grown up until they're thirty. Nice try, Martin, but try to write a little more convincingly."
1,"Oh, gag me","Yuck. This book was totally boring. Well, maybe you'll like it if you're, like, 7 or 8 years old or something. Not only is it totally boring, but poorly written. Which surprised me because Ann M. Martin is certainly not a bad writer! I'm really glad she left the BSC and started writing a new series about them. The BSC books are soo boring and childish. Please- a hard to handle babysitting adventure is when the dog runs loose for 2 seconds. Don't waste your time reading the BSC books. They are all pretty dumb."
2,catchy book title,"the mother's day surprise is about kristy mother and stepfather adopting emily michelle, a 2 year old baby girl from vietnam. The book is not really about that though it's mostly about the babysitters club and visiting stacey(who was in new york at the time) taking the kids to a carnival during the mother's day weekend to give them a day off or something. It may have been a sweet gesture, but during mother's day families actually LIKE to spend time with one another on the weekends and if I were a mother with kids and living in stoneybrook I never would have wanted to send my kids in the care of 13 year old girls on a festive weekend that is supposed to be family time. Come on!"
2,Legend Of The Condor Heroes,"The story line was good, but the acting and the props were like a ""b"" movie. Some of the so called outdoor scenes were so faked (The sky: you could make out the seams that they had pieced together). I was sorry I paid for this movie and was glad to see the end of it."
3,not bad,"A little bit to tight of a fit for me and my prism.Have to really shove it in.not very stylish Preety plain.But,It works for the price."
2,Windless,Unless you have extra money to throw away then save it and don't buy this product. It takes a good wind of at least 20 MPH to make this thing work even though it says you can set if for twelve MPH. It is cheaper to let the water blow away than waste your money on this.
1,All 3 have been defective,"I must say that we have My First Leappad and the original Leappad and love them so this came as a serious disappointment. And worse, all the units stopped working after the warranty ran out and I had purchased 5-6 books that only work on the Writing with Microphone. I have replaced the pens too (at a ridiculous shipping cost from the mfg.) but no change. The company knows this is a bad product but refuses to recall it. If I didn't know that a settlement would just end up in lawyer's pockets, I would consider joining a class action lawsuit (see reviews for the Leappad plus writing).... Shame on you Leappad!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,too expensive and easily malfunctions,"Tried My First Leappad and later, Leapster. Both stopped working after a few months - - even after new batteries inserted. Kept saying things like ""wrong cartridge"" when we had inserted correct one. ALso, it often gave information for a different page from the one we were using. I'm not sure why this is considered more educational than using a writing pad and pencil or just plain old reading! Needs an adult's help anyway. My child is very bright but found the whole thing frustrating (trying to insert cartridges, having incorrect vocals come out from the microphone etc etc). Other owners have said the same thing."
3,The eraser part is no fun,I got this leap pad for my little niece. The only problem that I had was that you have to keep erasing what ever you write. It comes with a large eraser but it no fun when you have to keep erasing for the little ones. This adds wear and tear on the pages. I also feel that the volume could be a little louder. It's a great learning tool but you just have to keep erasing.
5,Very general coverage of material,"You will need expert's knowledge in UNIX, Linux and Blade Servers to attempt this material. I found the book very useful for shops that have the newer Hardware technology. This book will show you how to implement the new Oracle 10g GRID technology coupled with RAC on blade servers and what is involved in the configuration process. I highly recommend only professional Database Administrators with new hardware & server(s) with more than 4gigs of memory for this book material. This is definitely not for a beginner. Please go here if you want DBA material for passing your Oracle CertificationOracle 10g Database Administrator: Implementation and AdministrationOracle 10g Database Administrator II: Backup/Recovery and Network AdministrationMy favorite book in my collect besides the Bible is Oracle 9i Performance & Tuning by Course.com (over 1,000 pages and covered more information than any other Oracle book I have ever read)."
5,Amazing deal for me,"I purchased this book for my brother,I can't comment on the content but this book arrived on time and it is as good as new book."
5,Go ahead and order the set,"I started book one of Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum series on Monday and eight days later had finished book ten. I love to read, but that is a record for me. Once you start this series, there is no putting it down. They are suspenseful, romantic and laugh-out-loud funny all at the same time. My advice is to go ahead and order all ten--you're going to need them."
2,not great but....,"Bleed all over me is classic , possibly the only good song on that album but i still bought it ."
3,? Not to sure....,"Well I bought this out of curiosity and it took a couple of listen's to understand what they were trying to do. I think the vocals are good but the band is ""so-so"". Jada needs a backing back that's strong like In This Moment. But it's a pretty OK first release."
3,"The Wisdom gives ""wicked"" vibes","Let me start by saying that as a Fishbone fan, it is great to hear Philip ""Fish"" Fisher hittin' the skins again in his unique, talented fashion (you're great bro'). The other three musicians were also on point, no doubt. A little upset at the fact that neither guitarist (2) did solos in any of the 10 songs here.Now, you know we have got to get at Jada Koren. She gives a so-so effort of the voice to this 4-male musician backing. She's not a heavy-metal singer. In a couple of the songs like ""Yesterday Don't Mean"" and ""One"", she's torn between rocking or rappin' like Ice-T fronting Body Count. Standout songs are ""Bleed All Over Me"", ""Cruel Intentions"", ""Forgiven"" and ""Set Me Free"".Like I said, it's a so-so effort. The CD is good for a handful of spins. The music outweighs Jada Koren's singing 2 to 1. But if W.W. gets Sharon Osborne (Ozzy's wife) approval for them rocking at Ozzyfest, Wicked Wisdom should never let that kind of honor down."
3,eh....alright,"I wont say that its a waste... But it wasn't really a good try. A few songs caught my attention, but the rest were just FAKE."
3,Great Music,"I think this album is good overall. I wish I could hear Jada sing more, but other than that I really like the music. After reading all the previous comments about them sounding like Rage Against the Machine and Kittie, I have to disagree. I think Wicked Wisdom sounds more like Flyleaf but without that girls' whiney voice. A lot of people don't seem to like this band, but I think they're just biased. Not because Jada is black, but because she's an actress and Will Smith's wife. If she wasn't already well-known, people would be loving this band."
2,ehhh,"sounds like a below average rock band that got signed on the merit of will smith's wife. 1 or 2 tracks are decent. otherwise, it's kind of contrived."
1,Horrible,"This is the worst cd I've heard in a long time, evertthing about it sucks, the vocals are horrible, Jada's a good actress, but shes the worst singer I've ever heard, this is not worth the money."
3,"4 * for the musicians, 2 * for jada = avg band","I heard ""something inside of me"" on the radio a couple of weeks ago and decided at that time to purchase the cd when it was released. I really enjoyed the band throughout the cd, unfortunately, jada's vocals are weak in my opinion. It was a good attempt and I can tell she may have the rage and angst required to perform this style of music, but she doesn't have any vocal range.I do want to mention that I really enjoy track #4, I can live with the vocals for this one."
1,fake,Someone made a formula by adding Flyleaf and Suicidal Tendencies. It didn't work out very well. This will be in the 99 cent bin in a week.
2,Lead singer sounds atrocious!! That's what wicked!,"If there's any good thing at all about this, it's that you can sense some musicianship from some of the instrumentalists in the band. The guitarist and drums sound okay. But the choice of lead singer is poor at best, and obviously either a hobby for Jada or a ploy for more sales through name recognition. Jada sounds absolutely HORRIBLE! No rhythm.....no melody to her voice....no vocal skills. She should really continue to pursue acting instead where she has much more potential. As a metal fan, I'm frankly insulted that she thinks this screaming, howling, & cussing, (so much for all her husband's promoting clean music & not having any need for bad language) would actually pass for metal music. Anyone who really appreciates metal would probably hate this album. I understand why grocery stores would've run out of eggs when WW was in town."
2,just the two of us...............................,"For those of you unaware, Wicked Wisdom is fronted by Jada Pinkett Smith, Wife Of Actor/rapper Will Smith. For some reason, whether her husband or someone else gave her the idea that she should form and front a heavy metal band. Tjis disc, is the sad, sorry resuklts of what happene next.Jada excorcises her demons on this album, but not very well. The music is mid paced Metalcore/grindcore, kind of reminding me of Crisis, but the music is actually the highpoint on this entire cd. The unbelieveably low point, however, is jada's vocals. It's like she tries to rap and scream at the same time, and it does not work. And She DOES NOT have a good clean singing voice. Period.Maybe Jada and the band should have taken the hint from all the ozzfest fans that booed them off the stage on a regular basis, and leave the music making to her equally talnetless husband"
1,nothing but pure garbage,"i saw this band live a few weeks ago with sevendust, and nonpoint, and i use the word (band) losely, the band it self was good, jada on the other hand was not, and jada just because you start to scream into the microphone will not make you any better, stay away from this at all costs. the only reason i gave it one star was because it didn't give me an option for pure s***"
2,Pasty,"This lip balm went on a bit pasty, it did not glide on smoothly as I would have liked. The color is good, but I will not purchase again because of the consistency and pastyness. Try Burts Bees instead for a good natural lip balm."
3,"GREAT CAMERA, BUT SOME ISSUES","This is the easiest camera to work with. It takes pretty great photos, and the software that comes with it walks you through the unloading of photos to your computer for e-mail, etc.However, there are some problems:1. Red eye reduction - Even though the camera has a ""red-eye reduction function"" red eye still prevails.2. Not compatible with AOL 7.0 - When sending photos e-mail, I have to send them through my hotmail.com e-mail because the camera isn't compatible with AOL 7.0, a problem that was confirmed when I called HP.3. Batteries - My batteries didn't last a day!! This camera DEVOURS batteries. I have the adapter, but can't use outside of the house!4. Screen - Is hard to see in bright light, and sometimes, not so bright light.Other than these issues, I really like this camera. It's my first digital. I will however, probably purchase a better one in the future."
4,Easy To USe,"I had ordered a Fuji(1.3) before this & was very discouraged.It was hard to understand and the quality of pictures I took weren't good at all.So I returned it,thinking maybe all lower priced Digital cameras were like that.But,then I saw the HP 318 with 2.3 megapixels,Decided to try it. I am glad I did.It is an easy Point&shoot camera.When I loaded them onto my computer,I could not believe the quality of the pictures.I highly recommend this camera,for its price,easiness to use and picture quality."
4,I like this camera!,"This is my first digital camera-in fact, I'm a novice at all computer-related stuff. So I needed something easy to operate, but good quality. This camera is excellent. It has great resolution, is very user-friendly. The instructions are clear. It is so simple to operate & the view screen is especially beneficial to those of us eager to see the results of our first photo attempts. It adapts to computer loading well & again, the step by step instructions help even beginners create & e-mail super pictures."
4,A must read.,"Catherine Palmer has again written a fabulous book. In this anthology she revisits a town called Hope and tells the story of Rolf Rustemeyer. I have read all of the books in the 'A town called Hope' series and this story lets me revisit my favourite series. Readers can also watch the lovable German farmer Ralf find his true love of the Kansas praire.Included in this anthology are stories by Elizabeth White and Peggy Stoks. Both of these women are fabulous authors and their love for the Lord is evident in their stories. Annie and Betsy make wonderful heroines and I fell in love with them as well as their men, Seneca Jones and Elmore Determan.This book is a must read for all Catherine Palmer fans and everyone who loved the 'A town called Hope' series."
2,Prairie Christmas,"I picked up this book mainly to read the first story, The Christmas Bride by Catherine Palmer, as it was a brief continuation of her Town Called Hope series. I very much enjoyed that series, and while the novella was pleasant enough, I found it lacking. It was just too short. Don't get me wrong though, I loved seeing the characters again and finding out what happened to Rolf and Lucy, I just feel they deserved a longer story.The story Reforming Seneca Jones was only ok and I could not get into the last story, Wishful Thinking, at all. In fact, I did not even finish that last story."
3,A Fair Basic Wilderness Module,"There are 3 routes to The Rock. Players only need to choose one, leaving the other two behind, sadly. Most players would choose the most direct one, the Western Trail. However, I like the northern trail the most. DMs may make some modification here. (Select trail at their own choice, not giving the right to players; or modify the road, let them pass through more than 1 trail. Moreover, DMs can develop the city of Tuma further."
3,Poor Transcription of an excellent album.,"Although Enya's music is superb, the transcriptions in this book leave something to be desired. Part of the trouble is of course due to the difficulty of arranging music originally for multiple instruments and voices for solo piano, but on other instances it seems to be more thoughtlessness on the parts of those who transcribed the music. For example:-Several of the pieces, such that ""Anywhere is"" and ""The Memory of Trees"" are very repetitive. In the original pieces, the harmonies and background change over the course of the song. In these arrangements, each verse is notated exactly the same.-In ""The Celts"", a D.S. al. Coda is given without any indication as to what point in the music the player is supposed to skip to the Coda-In ""Storms in Africa"", there are sections where the pianist is asked to play three notes simultaneously, each of which is at least an octave and a fifth apart from the others."
5,Tienes 3 manos?,"Ingenuamente creí que al comprar este libro podría reproducir algunas canciones de Enya, porque pensé que eran muy sencillas. Gran error!Se necesita ser un experto en los teclados (o la guitarra) y algunas partes no me explico cómo pudo Enya tocar, pareciera que tuviera una mano extra.El libro está muy bien, tiene las partituras muy exactas y con bastante práctica y paciencia estoy seguro que es posible sacar aunque sea unas tres melodías.Suerte!"
2,ViaVoice Mac OS X doesn't work beyond 10.3.5,"I recently purchased ViaVoice MAC OS X because I had used the OS 9 version and liked it. When I up-graded to a new G4 Powerbook running OS 10.3.7, I purchased the new version so that it would work with OS X. After installing it and going through the training, I found that I could not use it, because it kept unexpectedly quiting when I tried to launch Speakpad. I called Scansoft and was informed that it only works with 10.3.5 or below. I have searched many descriptions of the product and no mention of this was found. Tech support said that they had been working on it, but saw no new release in the near future. I would not recommend the product if you plan to use an up-to-date operating system. ScanSoft ought to make this clear in their product requierments."
1,Find an Alternative,"I've been in touch with Nuance to ask about compatibilty. The reviewer above is right that ViaVoice doesn't work with later versions of Mac OS 10.3/Panther. Neither does it work with any version of 10.4/Tiger. I was told that Nuance is working on a Tiger-compatible upgrade, but that no release date for the upgrade could be given-- not even an approximate one. Unless you're willing to postpone upgrades of your OS indefinitely, order iListen instead. It isn't Naturally Speaking, but at least it runs on the current Mac OS."
1,Disappointed after using Viavoice PC version,"Viavoice is running on my PC and it does very well. I hoped that was getting the same or similar product for my iBook G4, but it has been a disappointment. The software frequently stops responding, Speak Pad dictation screens crash often and without warning, and the correction process is slow and tedious. Microphone shuts off during corrections and must be frequently restarted. These are major complaints but there are many minor ones. For example, defined formatting decisions such as starting sentences with numerals rather than written numbers (2 cats vs Two cats...) is time consuming to correct. In contrast to the PC version of Viavoice, the OSX version is painstaking. These observations cover about 6 months of use; I'm about to quit trying."
1,I HAD TO TYPE THIS BY HAND,I have a MAC IBOOK G4 OSX 10.4 The viavoice software has been nothing but problems.Getting severally stuck on words in making a voice model of my own. Then in everyday use It would work for a sentence then get stuck and I would have to restart. It cannot process any of my documents. IBM just wanted my money.
1,Don't buy this product,"While the box claims this product is OS X compatible, we have not been able to even complete installation. Turns out it used to work with OS.X, and customer support in India sez they're working on a new version. yeah, right. IBM has nothing to do with it, they dumped it on another company."
1,"very poor, like most IBM softwre for consumers","a huge company like ibm is unable to produce a half way acceptable product for the masses. sad but true. actually, has ibm EVER produced a pc program that was ready for prime time? they sold DOS to gates and thus made him a millionaire and pretty well messed up with OS/2...reminds me of AT&T; that are also unable to produce anything successful outside of their major line of business (telcom). anybodty remember the att&t; line of computers, think theyt were called B1 or something???the bad news is that the only other voice recognition software for the mac i know of, ilisten, is pretty bad also. best is dragon naturallyspeaking 9 for the pc."
2,"Good Idea, Cheap Execution","Ever since buying my Visor Edge, I'd been looking for a replacement stylus that was easier to hold and smoother to write with than the original one. This looked like the ticket, and when it first arrived it seemed to fit the bill. Sure it was a little plasticky and didn't actually latch onto the Visor, but it fit in the hand pretty well. But I almost immediately had trouble with it popping off the Visor when I jammed it in my pocket, and this problem just got worse until I had to carry the stylus seperately in my pocket. Eventually I had to return to the original stylus. The attach mechanism is just plain cheap - more suitable to a disposable item than an adjunct to a $400 computer. I'd be willing to pay more for someone to make this thing right, but for mow the original stylus is the best thing going."
5,Old Movie,"Excellent; nice to see many of the now gone people as I use to remember them. Movie was great, too..."
5,Classic remastered,"This review is for the Blu-Ray version of Ocean's 11. The picture and sound are almost perfect when watching on Blu-Ray with the movie pictured in Widescreen format. As for the story itself, it couldn't get any better with Ocean and his paratroopers stealing from the casinos and to the end. Which could never get old, looking at their faces, like what just happened. This is a must have for any old movie fan either for the DVD and for the Blu-Ray (if you have the player). I would recommend this."
3,OCEANS ELEVEN,"Saw this movie when it first came out and although, like quite often, when seeing them years later they don't seem quite as good as you remember.This is one of those films which isn't as fast paced as the new version. Picture quality is very good and although the sound is mono this also is very good. Great transfer.Worth buying if you like THE RAT PACK and can get it at a good price.Has a different ending to the new one and I think better."
4,Look at that pancake makeup!,"I like this movie - I'm a HUGE Sinatra fan - and so I was glad to get in on Blu Ray. I wondered myself how an ""older"" movie would look in ""HD"". Overall, it looks amazing. It's perfectly crisp and clear. One thing I did notice, however, was the large amount of pancake makeup used on the actors! There's one scene, about halfway through, when Frank is talking to some mistress of his, and WOW - you can really see the outline of the pancake makeup around his face! It's kind of laughable. I'm not a HUGE fan of this movie, because I personally think the acting stinks. But, if you take it as a sort of action-comedy, it's easier to digest.-The blu-ray itself has nothing for extra features - nothing new for Blu Ray, at least. And the main menu is utterly uninspired and is just some grainy close-up of 4 of the main actors.-5 stars for the quality of the picture. 3 stars for the disc itself."
1,Can't Turn Off Commentary,"Don't buy this version if you actually want to enjoy the movie. The commentary does not turn off so you can just hear the dialogue w/out interruption Yak yak yak thru the whole movie like a continuous guided tour. We tried by every possible means to turn the yak yak off. No dice.After the movie had played all the way thru w/ the non-stop commentary, THEN it was possible to turn off the commentary -- but guess what. Since the commentary track and audio track are combined, if the commentary is turned off, the audio to the dialogue is still turned off. Which means you can't watch the movie by itself without the commentary. Big waste of money."
5,This is what Blu-ray is ALL ABOUT.,"Simply put, this film has not looked better since it played in a theater.Warner Brothers did a fantastic job with the transfer and it looks even better than the version that's played HBO and Cinemax off and on over the past few years.If you're a fan of this film, you OWE IT TO YOURSELF to purchase this disc, even if it means you need to purchase a Blu-ray player as well!Note the commentary is the same one from the DVD editions, but is still entertaining, and there are a few new extras on this disc.I'll be forever grateful that WB decided to issue this catalog title on BD."
5,This is a great movie.,"I am glad that I can go back and watch a great movie with actors with real talent compared to the crap movies that are out there today,"
5,When Ratboy Lived Next Door,this is a very good book i read when i was in the reading bowl. im surprised so little people have read this book:)good romance and sweet plot.
1,Does Nothing - After 9 Months Daily Use - Scam,"I'm a middle-aged female with slight overall thinning of hair. I purchased 4 large bottles of Osmotics FNS Follicle Nutrient Serum in February 2010. I used it generously every day for 9 months, with absolutely NO results. No new hair growth whatsoever, no thickening of hair shaft. Not even any increased shedding in preparation of new hairs beginning to grow. I'm so embarrassed to have been taken for a chump. Do not buy this worthless product - it's a scam designed to give false hope to vain people.Remember Barnum's words: there's a sucker born every minute!"
5,A nightmare in three parts,"JC has always been very deceptive in his style: simple language, many fantastic elements, and heartwarming moments. However, all these elements are accompanied with severe dark fantasy or even horror.I find this book to be the most extreme example of what I just cited. A deceptively simple story starts with the hero falling in love with a single mother, goes on with his discovery and eventual acceptance of the mother's dark secret, and ends with the consequences of such an an acceptance. It is a love story that ends like an ancient greek tragedy: complete devastation.In an uncharacteristic manner, this story has very little fantasy in it and all of it crammed at the very end which makes the feeling of devastation strangely real and permanent.I highly reccomended it."
3,Mixed feelings.,"First, I don't think this was as well written as some other of Carroll's books. Second, I don't think I should have liked the story at all. I felt sort of like an accomplice by continuing to turn the pages.In some respects the Publishers Weekly review above tells you the whole book. If you don't want to wade through the details, stop there. It tells way too much for a review.The review from School Library Journal says the book is YA. Huh??? Bunni Union either didn't really read the book or her opinion of appropriateness for young adults is far different from mine.If you have not read Carroll, start with Land of Laughs."
5,Super FUN book,"This silly creative book is one of my favorites. My boys bring me the book (to read to them) saying ""here's your favorite, Mom."""
2,Lame!!!,Jaclyn used to live in chigo with her aunt Greeta (her mother died and her father disappeared when she was two.) Not any more! Now she lives in a wierd mountain village called Sherpia. In Sherpia Jaclyn met two friends Rolonda and Eli. They belive in this wierd story. Two sorceerers used magic to bring it to life. But they lost control of it.The sorceerers tried to put speels on it to put it back to sleep. their magic wasn't powerful enough. Somehow they forced the snowman into an ice ave at the top of the mountain. And he;s still there today.It sounds good but it's really boring! DO NOT READ!!!!--Scottie Schaeffer age 10
3,Tim's review,"I really liked the book Beware the Snowman. I like fictional books and it had a happy ending. I have read a lot of other Goosebumps books but they were better than this one. This one was not as scary.The book was about Jaclyn. She moved from Chicago to Sherpia, a town that has a strange history about an evil snowman. Jaclyn wanted to disprove the story of the snowman. Jaclyn climbed to the place the snowman lives, it turns out the snowman is real.I think someone who likes fake stories would like this book because none of this stuff could ever happen."
1,Awful.,"Awful. Absolutely awful. What was R.L. Stine trying toaccomplish with this? The prose is about as complex as that of a 6thgrad english student's, and it didn't scare me at all. This ain't something that I'd reccomend to those folks who, for whatever, sit around the campfire and tell scary stories, either. The Snowman creatures just didn't threaten me. There's not a single good laugh in the whole book (unless you're one of those irritating people who snicker at kitsch) and not an ounce of nuance."
5,"Clearly, the best Goosebumps Book!","This book was amazingly good! It's about Jaclyn, a 12 year old who lives with her aunt and is shocked when they move to a village in the Arctic Circle. Jaclyn soon realizes this village has a creepy tale with it. I am not spoiling the ending. All I can tell is it has a bed tempered snowman and a creepy poem in it! Read this! It's awesome!!!!!!!!!"
5,Finaly!!!!,"This is one of my all time favourite Coryell albums. I have Been waiting for a long time for this to come out on cd, I own the record! I discovered Coryell back when the fusion stuff was taking off, early - mid 70's. I got to see Larry open for John Mclaughlin with his ""One Truth Band"" at the Columbus Ohio Agora Larry and John even did an impromptu` just trading licks onstage. Kowloon Jag, Titus, and Aspects, are probably my fav's. One thing I always liked about Larry, he's famous for doing a song in one take, even if it meant leaving a 'pucker' (mistake) on the recording to keep it fresh. Watch out folks, don't be alarmed, this album comes from and era when every song on an album was good. Get This One!"
3,A Nice Flick,This film gets better as it goes along & ends up a prettyy good flick - but it's still only 3 stars IMO.
4,Union Station,"Just ordered the DVD of this movie. I had it on VHS, then was able to record it to DVD-R but want a professional copy also. This movie is among my favorite noir. I like William Holden and Barry Fitzgerald. Fitzgerald in Naked City was excellent and he does a good job here also. The late 40's and early 50's were, in my opinion, the golden age of noir. Many fine movies were made in that genre and this is one of them. You had the tough but really sensitive cop or private eye, the girl in distress, the criminal who was out to get everyone, and some really classic settings on locale. Combine that together and you have some really good entertainment. It's a window to a bygone era. I could care less about some of the aspects some reviewers put into their synopsis. It's entertainment, what more do you want?"
5,As described,"Individually packaged, good price, shipped quickly. What more could you ask for? I will buy these again. three more words required."
1,hm,"todays, i am setting up AAA system environment with EAP-TLS ..mobile node is a notepad ( ibm r52-4fk, intel pro 2159 interface , ipw2200 ) and freeradius which support eap-tls,during setup period, i found this 1131ag can't support open WEP .."
1,Poor Battery Life,We also tried to use these batteries in our Canon 590IS and found that they lasted only a short time (maybe 10 pictures). We had purchased the batteries along with a Targus charger. We tried the batteries in a AA powered lint remover as well and had the same experience. They weren't strong enough to power the lint remover when pressed against the clothing. I'd love to find out why they're not working.
1,Can't last 8 hours,"I got these batteries 3 days ago. Put them on the charger and today put 2 of them in my Kodak PowerShot A590IS. I took 33 pictures. Then I went shopping and left the camera home. While I was cooking dinner I thought I would review the pictures. Turned the camera on and it flashed the change battery light at me.So I changed over to the two others, and immediately the screen told me to change batteries. Those were dead too.Tomorrow they are going back to the store. They are JUNK batteries."
3,Book is great but the cd?,"Let's face it: Ari is a pretty boy. He knows it & so do we! He's so sexy it's a sin but dude can't sing. He knows it & so do we! I've never heard him live but listening to some of his music, I can imagine what he'd sound like. Not being mean (after all, I did say he was sexy), just keepin' it real. Everyone can't sing but apparently that isn't stopping Ari, God love him. I don't know where he finds the nerve but hey.....Now Billy Porter (I hear he's Ari's boyfriend) is very talented, great voice on cd & in person. Like I said, very talented. I know this is supposed to be all about Ari but I just thought I'd give Billy a well deserved plug."
2,"again, got what i paid for","these earings looked so awesome in the picture, but when i got them i noticed they are made out of some sort of tin like metal. very cheap looking up close, but then again they were cheap sooooo. i wouldnt be so disapointed in them if the shipping wasnt so expensive, with that added to the price it wasnt worth the purchase."
4,"Pretty, but Heavy","These were pretty, fun earrings. Only drawback was my ears hurt by the end of the day, because they weigh so much. But for the price, a great deal."
5,Good to Keep An Extra on Hand,"You never know when you are going to lose your stylus, so great to have an extra on hand ... very helpful tool."
2,Easy to lose....,"The reason I purchased the 2pac stylus is that, when I pulled out the PDA out or putting it back in my pocket it fell of because the button is so easily released with the slightest pressure. I didn't even know until it was too late.... so Watch out how you hold you PDA when you pull it out or put it back!!!!Taz"
1,Decepcionante!,"Moix vendio su libro basado en su fama de antifranquismo.(Para mi seria un defecto mas), pero ni eso. lo unico que es, es anti-interesante; Aburridisimo!!"
2,At least it includes an eval copy of SQL Server...,"Let's just say this is not a very good dummies book. There are very very few ""real world"" examples of the topics presented. The technical accuracy is pretty decent, but this book will not enlighten any beginners to the world of SQL Server. Advanced topics are rarely explained in layman terms and the depth of coverage is, shall we say, not very deep at all! Stick to the SQL Server Online Books (which this book just seems to re-hash, albeit in much less detail) and you'll learn alot more about SQL Server."
3,"Not bad, but could be better","This is a good book if you are a ""rank beginner"" and you don't need to do anything complex with SQL. It's missing a lot of information that could be considered more advanced.I bought it to help me with my SQL queries in Active Server Pages and I just haven't found it to be that useful. One of my employees, who knows nothing about SQL has found it to be very useful, however."
1,ummmmmmmmmmmmmmm...,"What the hell is this? This has GOT to be illegal! I believe Doreen Valiente is the one who would give permission for Gardner's actual material re-printed, or it would be in the hands of their publisher from their original ""Book of Shadows"" published grimoire.Gerald's NAME isn't even SPELLED CORRECTLY on the cover! WTF? This, if nothing else, should be an indicator as to what the material is like. Who is this other author? Obviously not Valiente. I wouldn't credit this book more than the dirt on my shoe."
1,No stars would be more accurate.,Never trust a book that misspells the author's name on the cover.You're not going to get a REAL Gardnerian book of shadows unless you're initiated into a Gardnerian coven. Want to know what they know? You'll have to do the work. Don't feel called to be a Gardnerian? Why would you ever need their BOS?
1,The Abundance of Crap,"While I certainly agree that all of the Gardnerian BOS has been published in one form another and there isn't any great big secret bit to it, I have to disagree with the idea that ""there are no hidden secrets to the Gardnerian tradition ..."" If there weren't any secrets, it wouldn't be a Mystery Religion. And, the secrets don't have to be secrets kept by humans, but those kept by the Divine, only to be revealed when the time is right.If you buy this book, you do yourself and traditional Wicca - especially if you want to learn traditional Wicca - a great disservice. Stay away from the abundance of crap."
1,Not what it claims to be,"If you're looking for the Gardnerian Book of Shadows, you aren't going to find the real complete book on-line or published. Was some of it leaked? Maybe. Was it mixed with misinformation and lies? Perhaps. Are the bits and pieces available even ""the real thing""? Not exactly. The only way to get the real Book of Shadows is after initiation into a proper coven with an actual lineage that can be traced. Use this book for what it is, but not fall for the story that it's the actual Book of Shadows as passed along by Gardner."
1,"Crashes, crashes, crashes - DO NOT BUY","Installed ViaVoice 10 in Windows XP Pro...And sometimes it opens and sometimes it doesn't. Mainly doesn't.Then I find this...via Google..Problem:After launching Dragon or ViaVoice and clicking a link in one of the menus, the system locks up or freezes. Other symptoms include Dragon NaturallySpeaking's Select-and-Say or ViaVoice's dictation and commands fail in Microsoft Office XP applications, such as Word and Microsoft Outlook.Cause:Microsoft Office XP's ""Alternate User Input"" installs a background process called CTFMON.exe which can interfere with Dragon or ViaVoice. The following information was taken from the Microsoft website:""...Ctfmon.exe monitors the active windows and provides text input service support for speech recognition, handwriting recognition, keyboard, translation, and other alternative user input technologies....""And you can get NO, repeat, NO, help from ScanSoft.DO NOT BUY!"
2,Terrible Support - Many Installation Problems,"An earlier ViaVoice installation 3 years ago went fine and the product was pretty useful and accurate enough for my purposes.ViaVoice version 10 however has been a nightmare. I still have not been able to install it on a Win2K-SP4 computer. I am a fairly advanced computer programmer/systems person with 20+ years of experience.Support is virtually non-existent from Scansoft. My 30 days of free support from IBM where I purchased the product has not been honored. All support has to come from Scansoft.Great features, if you can access them. I am seriously thinking of demanding my money back. Washington State has some very consumer friendly laws regarding ""Fitness for Purpose"", one more reason I am grateful to live in the Northwest."
2,do not buy it if you have mcafee internet security soft ware,IBM viavoice usbpro has major conflict issues with mcafee internet security suite(6.)Ibm redirects you to scansoft that has a lousy support which is charged to your credit card after the first free query;their online knowledge database is sparse and the tech personell seem to be reading their answers from algorhythms with background knowledge barely above the average customer's; Mcafee has a more extensive online database but no free tech support phone calls; problems of conflict between the softwares were related to TCP/IP port (viavoice apparently works through an open port) and to speech engine conflicts;none could resolve these issues;such issues in my opinion can only be resolved by interdisciplinary programmers;short of this the choice is one software verses the other
1,IBM ViaVoice Pro USB Edition Does Not Work with Windows XP Home Ed,"I read the product info and the reviews about ViaVoice Professional 10 before purchase and it sounded great. I wanted to use it with my Olympus Digital recorder DSS voice files and for voice transcription purposes. Nuance says it works with Windows XP Home Edition but after failure to install, I contacted Technical Support who advised me that it does not work with Windows XP Home Edition Version 2002, Service Pack 2. The technician told me that I 'should' have gotten Dragon Naturally Speaking Preferred Edition. Thankfully, Amazon has a wonderfully smooth return process. Will let you know about Dragon later."
4,Good counseling resource,"As someone who counsels on a daily basis, this is a good resource. I would recomend the book (if you already don't have it) to every pastor, counselor and joung people who are looking for stable, joyous and full filing marriage relationship."
5,Lots of good stuff,I've read about 5 premarital counseling books and this was the best and most useful. In fact I pull it off my shelf every time I'm counseling couples preparing for a Godly marriage. I especially like the section about disfunctional families.
2,Very Christian slant,"Interesting points, however, buyer should know that it takes a pastoral, not necessarily a counseling, perspective to couple's work."
2,Backboard Fell Apart,"I purchased this for my son for his birthday. It was fairly easy to assemble but a few weeks later, the edge of the backboard came unglued from the frame. A rain storm with strong winds took out 1/2 of the plexiglass. The rest fell out later in the season. I've inquired for a replacement backboard but it looks like it will be difficult to replace. This was a disappointment."
1,acrylic comes unglued,no more needs to be said! a piece of junk. can't believe you pay so much money for an item and it falls apart. don't they test these things before they sell them?
5,Great Mystery Series,"We love everything about this series. The stories are often woven in and around historical people. For example, Tesla plays an imortant part in several."
4,Family entertainment,I enjoy this period piece. Fun when Murdoch invents and Higgins thinks up ideas that might be popular in the future
5,All season 4 episodes,"Ihave enjoyed four seasons of Murdoch Mysteries because of ease in ordering. However, I do not want to order discs, as is the option on Season 5. Could you possibly offer this season in the same style as Season 4, where I could order each episode individually? Would certainly appreciate it."
5,Murdoch Mysteries,"Murdoch Mysteries ia a well written series, has both mystery intrigue and a sweet love story, and the star is a very attractive man"
5,LOVE IT! Wishing it won't end!,Love thinking along with 'Murdoch'! (especially since he is so easy on the eyes! LOL Wish the series would continue!
4,A very fun Canadian Victorian series,"Even though this series is considered a drama, I still enjoy its ""campy"" moments...and there are many. The characters are all well developed and likable. The George Crabtree character is a delight with all of his off-the-cuff comments that tie into the future as we already know it. Even the stiff and very proper Murdoch is an appealing guy. Much of the ""fun"" of the series are Murdoch's crime-fighting inventions. Using the technology that existed in that era (end of the 19th century), he conjures up crude versions of our modern day technology such as night-vision goggles and sonar. Real history appears in many of the episodes, along with real historical figures that have a part in the fictional mystery. A very enjoyable, light-hearted mystery."
4,Great twist on standard detective fare,"The addition of the historical accurate context makes this series stand out. Characters are likeable and acting is by and large good (although I wish Murdoch would be a bit more outwardly expressive when he's wrapped up in his inner life). The relationship between Julia and Murdock is so frustrating -- even in the 1890s, would former lovers be so reticent to speak their minds?"
3,Shallow and unbelievable,I wanted to like this better than that. After seeing other series it left much to be desired. It is my habit to watch things more than once. Don't want to do that in this case.
1,Murdoch Mysteries Season 4,I have not received this item and do not plan to purchase this series. If charged for it I shall refuse to Pay! Iwill dispute any charges to my credit company!! Now contact me at my e-mail of record!!
1,a promising flop,"I used to drive armored vehicles in the Army. Though I know a computer program will never be like the real thing, this one started out good and ended up being a flop. I liked the physics... the tank rocked back and forth when the brakes were applied, moved in a similar manner, etc. At the point where the firing action started however it fails miserably. You cannot seem to actually hit or destroy anything, and although you are in a shell of steel it only takes a few potshots for the enemy to wipe the floor with you. The command controls are confusing and it is difficult to figure out which round to use and how to make sure you even have the right round. Having been at the controls of the real thing I want at least some reasonable level of realism when it comes to gameplay, and this one has very little to offer. It is a good thing I did not spend much on it... I will not do so again."
3,"Game is great but can't find the ""powerful mission editor"" its supposed to come with","Graphics are great, gameplay is great, but I like making my own missions and so a major factor in buying this was the ""powerful mission editor"" but as near as I can tell there isn't one. There is .pdf tutorial on how to use it but its not helpful as step 1 is ""open mission editor"". Its fun but it would be so much more so if it had the mission editor it claims it should come with. (haven't heard back from any of my requests to Strategy First support)"
1,Next to useless,"I'm not really sure why this product is on the market. It doesn't do anything that I can tell. Don't let the fan size fool you, the increased air movement is so small it's not worth the purchase price, or the noise. It's designed in a strange way, if you ask me. Why they didn't just put a small fan at the end of the heater at the top (the end without the controls) instead of this, I'll never know. How much air does this move? Well, you know what faint feeling of air moving past your ear you sometimes get when someone whispers something into your ear? Yeah, it's about that much."
2,Lame,I installed the fan on my heater. The only way I know it's on is I can hear it. Does not seem to move any air or heat around the area.
3,Blower Kit,"This blower was relatively easy to install but to me, the small amount of air it moves is not worth the noise. It's laud."
1,Must have for heater,Fan will not work in automatic mode. But the heater is attached to the wall and I'm not going to pull it off to get to the fan.
2,Pretty Useless...,"This book was recommended to me by other c3 owners. Well...if you have the internet and you know how to use it, this book is useless. It basically repeats everything you can look up on the net or find out from c3 forums. I returned the book. The pictures are nice and are the only +"
1,Don't buy this one!,"Don't let your retailer's excellent return policy lead you to buy this without reading the reviews first! Like others, I liked the VR2940 at first, especially the YES-DVD software. But in the end I wasted a huge amount of time trying to make it work. I thought only computers crashed, needing to be unplugged in order to be escape from a death-freeze. That was before buying this unit.I also could not get my other DVD player to read the finalized DVDs, and could not figure out how to finalize YES-DVDs.Customer service was entirely useless. Impossible to get a live person or a response to an e-mail."
1,Go Video VR2940,"I have already returned the item. In fact, it only worked effectively once, and from then on, was only able to muster up a light blue horizontal line across the middle of my tele. Neither the vcr or the dvd worked after the first couple of hours.Very disappointed.John Giles"
3,VR2940,I am one of the few who had a relatively good experience with this product. The product does freeze in the burning process from time to time. But my main negative point about the VR2940 is that the manual did not alert users to the fact that this unit does not support any DVD-Rs with speeds above 4X. Quite an oversight on the part of GoVideo. The model also tends to blackout if there is a poor quality vhs inserted. Having siad that; I have burnt over 100 hours of home videos with good results and the DVDs have played on most other players.
3,Could be better.,Timer does not always work. Sometimes locks up when erasing or formating a DVD. Records from VHS to DVD at a real good quality.
3,Not Share-able,"It is indeed easy to record to and from DVD and VHS.However, the DVDs probably won't play on other DVD players. I sent DVD copies of home videos to six family members who had different DVD players - and NONE of the DVDs would play. They played just fine on my recorder, but not on theirs.Buried halfway inside the owner's manual is the warning that -R recorders are not compatible with +R recorders. Who knew that there were -R and +R recorders? Apparently the difference is akin to Beta and VHS. But at least the Beta and VHS recorders made it clear that that is what they are. This recorder has no such marking; it requires you to purchase it and read all the fine print.So unless you plan to carry this recorder around with you in order to show your recorded DVDs to family and friends, you might want to reconsider its purchase."
3,complicated,"the unit is complicated to use, seems to be a little slow but the video and audio are good."
2,"It works, just not well enough","At first, this machine worked fine playing VHS tapes and DVD's. When we finally tried to burn a DVD, however, nothing would work. The solution turned out to be upgrading the loader and system software, easier than it sounds, but annoying and time consuming.Once that was accomplished, we were able to burn DVD's that play successfully on half our six DVD players. This is disappointing and calls to GoVideo suggest that there's simply nothing to be done about it.If you're OK with playing the GoVideo burned DVD only in the GoVideo unit itself, you should be OK. If you need to send the resulting DVD to mom or to play it on your Sony portable while traveling, this unit is a gamble you probably shouldn't take."
1,PIECE OF CRAP,I wish I would have read these reviews before I purchased this piece of junk. I had problems like all the others. I called customer service and they wanted me to send them my new unit and they would send a refurbished one. I was lucky that I purchased mine from QVC and I sent it back for a full refund. I am trying an RCA model from Walmart now.
1,Get TiVo instead,"This unit is a piece of garbage. I had it for 6 months and it never worked right. Remote freezing, timed recording not working, erased previously recorded dvds on it's own, ruined dvds, would not turn off had to unplug to get it to. Customer service was of no help. I was finally able to return it after repeated ranting calls. This unit should be recalled."
1,GARBAGE! AVOID GO VIDEO,"OK, my fault, Wife and I bought this on qvc Christmas 2004, paid over 350.00, worked ok for a week. Only used it as a player for a couple months, then it wouldn't turn on or off without unplugging it!Nothing but problems since! I wouldn't buy anything GO VIDEO ever! JUNK!!!!!!!!"
5,Go Video Does to Better,"This is just a great piece of equipment. I currently own (2) VR2940 and looking at purchasing the third unit. It does a fantastic job recording the home movies to DVD and makes a great play back unit. I don't understand some of the previous reviews. You must be able to read the manual and follow directions. The manual is very detailed so normal adults will have an easy time understanding its functionality. You can not just start pressing buttons and expect the equipment to work. Lets face it, it is not brain surgery. It's a VRC comb unit. Buy it, look at the manual, you will love it. The best part is the cover you print for the DVD case, now this is the fantastic part."
1,Truly a piece of junk!,"I had miltple problems with this one, almost from the day I bought it! The YES video quit working within the first week. I was not able to get any help from customer service so I decided to deal with that and just make dvd's without using the YES video feature. In addition to that after finalizing the dvd's I did make...there were compatability issues with other players as well as the Go-Video player itself. I can honestly say I have never owned any player or recorder that is as unreliable as this one. To top it off the last dvd I made is locked in the recorder and the record light is still on...even if you turn it off and back on again the record light does not go off and I am unable to retrieve my dvd."
1,GEO DVD/VCR,"I have had this item for approximately 16 years. Not only has it stopped working, but all of my CD/DVD's that I made from my VHS tapes will not play in any other DVD/CD player. I have no way of viewing priceless Cd's of my grandson. I have purchased and returned numerous other DVD/CD players and had to return them as they would not play the CD's that I had made with the GEO. IF SOMEONE KNOWS OF A SOLUTION TO MY PROBLEM, PLEASE LET ME KNOW."
1,This is service?,"GoVideo brags about its service. Here is what they really have. You have a problem, you call them. There is a voice that tells you to go to their website. You leave them an email, you get a response that says go to our website. At the website you get general instructions. There are no people that will talk to you if you have a special issue. Basically there is no service that I can find. The product doesn't work quite the way it is advertised either. Save your money. This company has nothing to brag about."
1,Great item when it worked,"I was so pleased with this recorder the first week I had it till it started to freeze when shutting it off. It was user friendly and quality of picture and sound was great. I could live with the freezing when shutting it off but it started freezing when converting a tape to a DVD and at the end making the DVD useless after spending the hours converting it. It just got worse and worse so I was wasting time and money on the blank DVDs. White glove customer service is a joke. I've been calling for weeks and they claim an overload of calls to call back and when I did finally get a real person they couldn't help. Unfortunately my last alternative was to send it back for a refund to Amazon. I'm now afraid to exchange or purchase another GoVideo product due to this bad experience with them.However, I will say I never once had a problem with Amazon. They are great as far as prices and exchanges and customer service."
1,STAY AWAY FROM THIS ONE,This unit came with so many problems that I had to return it to Go Video. My replacement was a refurbished unit (for which I paid full price). This new unit usually cannot play the discs that it recorded. The times that it does play lasts only 20 minutes or so before the screen goes blank. Customer service is as bad as the unit itself. I've been waiting a week now to get a response. Read the other reviews of this product and then buy something else. Go Video should not have put this product on the market.
1,Waste of money,"If you're among those who are happy with this machine... good for you... you're VERY lucky!Like most of the reports here, mine's junk too. I recorded a bunch of my old ""classic"" VCR's to DVD and was not smart enough to save the tapes. A lot of them were re-recorded and now lost.The machine freezes with every Go recorded disk, and the Go disks will not play with ANY other machine, either. It will play only factory DVD's. I wish I'd never seen the stupid thing. BIG mistake and BIG waste of money.I'm now looking for a new reliable machine (that is, when I can afford it).You can try it if you wish, but I don't think you'll be happy! In my opinion, it's no more than an expensive DVD player, and totally worthless as a recorder."
1,Poor service company,"The products don't come with a ""snack over lid"" or the lid. As a result of that, I had to use plastic wraps to cover the snack trap to prevent dirt/dust from going into the snack trap. I finally attempted to order the lids online and had trouble doing so because they have a very bad website. Well, I wrote and called and got no response from the company. What is the point of getting the snack trap if it doesn't come with lids? The product is poorly designed. I wish I didn't spend my money on it. What a waste!"
1,Most awful and painful product!,"This product is made with cheap plastic and the lid scratches your hand everytime you reach in...who would want to have their child's hand go through the painful scratching lid for a handful of cheerios?!? It's like tourturing the child everytime he wants some snacks. Unlike the pictue, I received a very ugly green one with a picture of a cow on it. The brand was ""The Snack Trap"" and not ""Made For Mom Snack Trap."" This is a total rip off! Product was made in India. I'd give it no star if that was an option!"
1,Complete Failure to Perform as Advertised,"Forget about taking the lid off - all the kid has to do is hold down one flap and turn the cup upside-down. This can't be used for any small snacks, like Cheerios, which I'm sure most parents are using it for. I've only had success with large crackers staying in here and, even then, if she tilts it upside-down, the small fragmented pieces fall out everywhere. This snack trap just doesn't trap the snacks. I'm going to try the one made by Munchkin."
2,The Eyemodule2 is a toy,"The Eyemodule2 sounded like a fun toy BUT it's really just a toy. The shutter speed is a second or two. So it's real hard to hold the Handspring steady to avoid the inevitable blur.But more annoying, when I went to intall the software on my PC, the install failed twice. First, it couldn't find ""The Conduit"". The website explained it was a known problem, and I should install 3 of the 4 modules from the CD-ROM and then do the Conduit from the Web.So I unchecked the Conduit from the install list, and it started to install. But soon it warned that there was a missing DLL. Later it said the install was unsucessfull.This whole situation shows there is no quality control there. This may be the last Handspring attachment I ever buy. I will try to use the Eyemodule occassionally (guess I'm stuck with it), but with low expectations."
1,Terrible resolution,"The applications that come with this camera are really cool; however, the [bad]resolution of the pictures taken by the eyemodule 2 render these good applications virtually useless. The pictures have a grainy quality at best. Pictures taken in daylight are of somewhat better quality, but not much. If you want decent digital pictures, my recommendation is to buy a real digital camera, and not this [one]."
5,Great Trance with a twist of German gurl dance Pop!?!,": ) I rate this album with 5 stars cause it has great upbeat sound! There are some old 80's favorites updated with new beats and trancy themes. Just as there are some new sounds most likely made in a German sound lab...Germans, but still great music and ok cars. I've always liked all the Volumes of future trance cuz they have never let me down. And this one is no exception!"
3,Not so easy,"I ordered an aluminum case to go with my new Handspring Visor Edge. It was advertised as ""easy to slide on and off."" NOT - the PDA seemed locked in - I popped the Visor on to the floor once trying to dislodge it. The cover is advertised as being able to stay on during synchronization. NOT again - it forces the PDA to sit just a bit too high in the cradle and does not allow it to connect. I'm returning mine."
3,The official leather case is definately a better product.,"The case need to be removed either using a leather or metal case. So if you want to protect your Visor Edge, it is the same no matter which case you use.The metal case is solid and does its job well. However, it has the following major CONs:1. Block half of the IR port.2. Hard to push out when removing and ofter leave black marks on the back of the unit.3. Need to remove the flip cover when using the metal case.It is a good product compare to any generic case. But as a Viso edge owner, I'll go with the leather case."
1,Why buy this,The Edge is an anodized aluminum sandwich with an anodized aluminum flip-top cover. I see no point in enclosing it in ANOTHER aluminum case that offers no additional protection. Unless:* You want to stick some notes to the left cover.* You want the cover to open to the left instead of to the top.* You hate the design on the flip-top cover.* You lost or broke the flip-top cover and want to try something different.* You want to fumble with something before you beam or synchronize.* You find the Edge too thin. ;-)* You love the Edge so much and want to buy its every accessory.
4,Good purchase,I bought this bike for my wife. We have both been using really cheap mountain bikes. After buying this and riding it a few times myself I decided I better get myself a new bike too. What a big step up from what we have been riding. It is so smooth riding down the road. The breaks are set up great. The seat and handle bars were both easy to adjust to fit my wife. The lack of the fifth star is because the 3rd and 4th gears always have trouble with the quick shifter system. I am guessing that with a better setup the gears would switch better but I don't really want to mess it up worse.
1,Never again will I buy a Schwinn,"I couldn't find the handle bar adjustment page for this bike in the Schwinn manual so I contacted the manufacturer. They told me ""Your bike is equipped with a threadless steerer tube and stem, which means you cannot simply loosen a bolt to raise the bars. In fact, trying to do so will unload the headset bearings and can make the bike unsafe to ride. Instead, you'll need a part like a riser stem or threadless steerer-extender, either of which is available through a local bike shop. Since raising the bars more than a small amount can necessitate longer cables and housing as well, you'll probably want a bike shop mechanic to handle the installation as well.""Schwinn also responded that this was really a great feature. Not in my opion. Rather than spend even more money on this bike, I'm just returning it. I'll find a bike that I can adjust to fit me."
2,don't settle for this one,"This bike has been a pain since the day I purchased it. I've had broken pedals, gear shifters that don't shift properly, unadjustable handlebars, and lousy brakes. I bought this bike thinking it was a good compromise between department store choices and the $400 bike shop bikes. If you add up all the work, repairs, and time I've put into this thing, it's pretty obvious I should have invested in something worthwhile. This bike is usable, but certainly not worth a $200 investment. Go for the real thing. Or find another mediocre bike that isn't $200."
5,I'm SO HAPPY NOW~~,"When I was a kid, I had a bike that just felt like it was a part of me.. Since being a child.. I've had a few bikes.. quite a few and never found the comfort and confidence that made riding so enjoyable to me.. Well I bought this bike and had to ride it home, just a few miles, and without adjusting it... I'm 5'5 I felt like a kid again. I just love everything about this bike..it's light and handles wonderfully. I think my first bike was a schwinn.. and my last bike will be a schwinn also..Oh If you are looking to greatly improve your health..check out my site. [...] get your free newsletter and eBook!"
4,"Great Bike, Great Value.","If you don't have a whole lot of money to spend and will settle for a department store bike, then this is it.And if you are buying it from Target for example, you can in fact return it... I returned a bike, that I had ridden around my block about 15 times,mud on the tires, and they took it back no questions asked, and I got this bike instead. MUCH MUCH BETTER.I do agree with the adjustments, and having a properly fitted bike IS important. But for most people I think that you won't have a problem with it.Very comfortable.I love it. Great for around town and the occasional loose gravel. One thing I would recommend , take it to a bike shop and get it tuned up. Just do it and it will make all the difference in the quality of your bike."
5,"Loving my ""first"" bike!","I bought this bike a week back from Target store directly. It was a display model and attractive color. I had done lot of research for the bikes that were in my budget (which was <=$300) and had visited walmart, Target and Costco for Schwinn bikes (as brand was finalised first!) .I tried all the bikes that were short listed by me (Schwinn Pathway and Avenue hybrid from walmart, Broadway from Costco). I did not like any of those bikes either were uncomfortable or tall for my height (I am 5ft 5inch. Also being first time biker found out that hybrid is way to go and then as soon as I saw this bike at Target I fell in love! Very attractive color and very comfortable. also perfect for my height! Its been over 60 miles and I am loving it!! So I would definitely give 5 stars to my first bike and recommend to such first time bikers! Enjoy riding!Also we bought Men's trailway bike for my hubby from Target and he is loving it too!!"
2,"Good value, but only if it fits you perfectly out of the box.","The handlebar height on this bike can only be adjusted a small amount. That's because it has a threadless headset, which weighs a bit less and is less expensive to manufacture, but doesn't allow the handlebar stem (the piece that clamps to the handlebars) to move up and down.Instead, loosening a bolt on the bottom of this stem allows for it to pivot a bit, but you can't lower the handlebars, you can't raise them very much, and you can't raise them at all without also moving the handlebars closer to the seat.The lack of adjustability makes this a chancey purchase even when purchased from the store, since Target will not accept returns on bicycles unless they have not been ridden _at all_.The bike has nice features for the price, but trying to ride a bike that doesn't fit is as bad as trying to walk in tight shoes. You'll see the two I bought (men's and women's) on craig's list."
5,Love this pillow!,I have been sleeping on a ChiroFlow pillow for over 10 years now. I like that it's adjustable by varying the amount of water I put in it. I have had neck issues for years and this pillow has helped a lot.
5,Fantastic Pillow!,If you have a problem with your next - this is the pillow for you! It is a fantastic product!!
3,water pillow vs normal pillow,"After many months of neck pain and back pain due to my 10 hours sitting a day computer job I needed a better bed and pillow. The bed I got was from isleep and is one of the best beds out there IMHO. Unfortunately the pillow didn't do it for me. Although I'm a bigger guy, 6'4'' and 235 lbs, I filled the pillow with the max amount of water and still don't feel any change in comfort from the $10 pillows I bought at costco. However, that being said my chiropractor told me many people who see him that have purchased the pillow love it and think it's better than the $140 tempur pedic ones out there. Good luck, hope this helps!"
2,not worth $50,Pillow is fair. Not a real solution for my neck/back stress/strain. Still waking up sore and stiff. I have tried differ volumes of water. Would not recommend for $50 price tag.
2,pillow,"I was disappointed in this product, my neck still hurts in the morning. I tried adjusting the amount of water, but it didn't help."
4,Water Filled Pillow,Good padding and good support. Product is well made and durable. This is my second purchase and the first product lasted several years.
3,Chiroflow Pillow,We bought two for our kids and they both seem to like them well enough but I am not getting a lot of 'excited' feed back.
5,Wonderfully adjustable,"I have found the perfect pillow. Finally! The very fact that you can adjust this pillow to fit your needs is enough for me. I have read the other reviews were they have found that weight of the pillow can get a bit overwhelming. This is irrelevant as far as I'm concerned. I have only removed and readjusted the fill in the pillow about 4 times and have not been burdened with the weight and transport of the pillow. Once you have the pillow the way you want it, you never have to move it. How easy is that!? I have used it for about 3 months now and my neck no longer hurts, and I do not wake up with headaches. I have accomplished what I set out to do."
1,Finally a pillow that I like - oops update it started leaking,"UPDATE: Saturday July 7, less than 3 months after purchase, the pillow started leaking on my bed.--------------------------Over the years I have tried many different kinds of pillows that were not that comfortable. The CHIROFLOW is comfortable. I filled it 3/4s full (6 quarts) to start and that seems fine for me. With that fill level the head and neck support for me is good if I rest my head, my neck and a little of my shoulders/shoulder blades on the pillow so my head is beyond the center line of the pillow. This allows my head to hang down a little bit."
2,disappointed,Thought this was going 2 be a great pillow 4 my neck/shoulder pain based on the other reviews. Got the pillow 1 month ago & thought it would take a few weeks 2 break in. 1 month later & my neck/ shoulder feel worse. I had better relief from my kohls $19 pillow.
3,"An Interesting Product, But Not Magical","I purchased this pillow on the recommendation of my chiropractor because I had been experiencing back and neck pain. The pain has subsided somewhat, but I think that is attributable to my continued visits to his clinic. I think that replacing my old pillow with any good-quality pillow probably would have accomplished what using this one has. The pillow is heavy because it has water in it, but the weight of it is not a problem for me. I wish I had tried purchasing a new, high quality pillow first before springing for this one which is hyped more than it probably should be."
3,Its ok,I am not sure if it does what it does. Never helped to prevent BV.And CVS has cheaper Folic Acid than this one.But this company definitely has differeny products that worth a shot. Like Digestive Enzymes that i purchased. Will see if it helps.
4,Good on basic fire safety,This DVD is good on basic fire safety in the home. It goes over most of the most important aspects of home fire safety and escape in case of a fire. I do wish that they would have also demostrated the basic use of a fire extinguisher. That is the only place where they lack.
3,"Idiosyncratic, Intriguing Book If You can Overlook Prejudices It Espouses","This ambitious, 454-page large-format book aspires to do no less than to""change forever [our] way of looking at the world, [our] homeculture and current events."" Surveying a broad range of issuesstarting with Wilhelm Reich's theories of human behavior, Saharasiaseeks to demonstrate a worldwide trend from woman-centered,peaceful societies to more male-centered, ""armored"" approaches. Tosupport these theories, the author provides a detailed discussionof the global geography of a broad range of social institutions,including male and female genital mutilations. Surprisingly,""homosexuality"" is treated as a social maladaptation comparable togenital mutilations, prostitution, and the like. While I retaindoubts about the reliability of some of the analysis and sourcematerials, Saharasia never fails to provoke and intrigue. '"
5,Fun Dance CD!,"I had heard this tune on C89.5 in Seattle, and instantly loved the catchy tune. This group from Romania will likely fall into ""one hit wonder"" territory, but I sure enjoyed this song!"
3,"Handy, but mine broke","This is a really handy case, especially since it will accommodate the add-on modules. However, I had some trouble with it popping off my belt when I sat down in chairs with arms, and I finally broke the clip off when I caught it getting into the car. It also makes me a little nervous that the hot-sync contacts are unprotected. Still, I am thinking about replacing it. It is convenient not to have to take it out of the case and then remove the cover."
5,Top Motorcraft Product,Top Motorcraft Product at half the normal price. What isn't there to love? With dirty fuel causing so many issues with new fuel injected cars I consider it cheap insurance to replace these at half the recommended interval.
4,Medieval mood,"I am glad to purchase this CD. ""Amadis Ensemble"" create the real atmosphere of medieval music. This disk is an issue of gladness for fans."

3,Fun multiplayer action,I just wanted to say that i found the ease of movement in this game to be very fluid which made the game more enjoyable than some other 3rd/1st person perspective games. The turning is responsive and the gameplay is really fun and easy to learn. Great game for friends to play over the nintendo WFC.
2,Strange war game,"The cartoonish artwork is OK, but the aiming and shooting interface is too awkward. I tried this game twice for about 3 hours total and just gave up."
4,Awesome!,"This is an awesome game for anyone in the family. Great fun for hours and hours...And hours. This is probably the best Battalion wars game yet. Here is how i rate it(just my opinions).Graphics:10/10(if you like cartoony graphics)Gameplay:9/10Difficulty:8/10Wi-Fi:7/10Fun:8/10Overall a terrific game, GET IT NOW!! and play me on wifi heh."
5,Get the 2-CD version of Evolution!,"Again the record companies confuse us with multiple versions of similarly titled albums! If you are a Dead or Alive fan, make sure you are buying the 2-CD version of this album. The single CD version is also very good, but of course, the 2-CD version gives you a lot more of DOA's very best, including some lesser known remixes. I have been waiting for a comprehensive collection of DOA material for years. They have done an excellent job of compiling some brilliant work together in one set. I'm somewhat disappointed with the liner booklet. Too many photos of Pete's new freaky look, and not enough stuff like lyrics or band history."
3,Evolution of Dead or Alive,"I believe I've had this CD pre-ordered forever!! I would like to say the wait has been worth it but, well.... Another reviewer pointed out the OBVIOUS pity--this CD DOES NOT contain the ""Murder Mix"" of You Spin Me 'Round--a HUGE disappointment. I have that mix (which is my favorite) on both vinyl and disc and have listened to it billions of times. Also, there is no 2003 mix of ""Something in My House"". I have enjoyed the older tunes, e.g. ""What I Want"" and ""Misty Circles"", but I am dismayed as to why there are so many definite mistakes about what the customer is getting. So, I would say ""Caveat Emptor--let the buyer beware."""
3,Dead or Alive: You spin me 'round like a scratched record.,"A good production, but the remixes were just unnecessary. Then, this best of compilation is not wholesome, nor pure. The new material wasn't as interesting as his 80's work. Overall, ""Evolution"" failed to impress me, just as did Human League. There's few bright moments on this cd. I especially like the upbeat songs such as ""My Heart Goes Bang."" Other than that, some of the songs are annoying, such as a cover of ""That's the way I like it"", which Roger Ebert classified as last century's most stupidest song. I agree, but at least Peter Burns didn't overwork it. This cd is necessary if you are a fan, but can also satisfy the ears of casual listeners."
2,Only so-so,"The book has decent recommendations, but a little too ""cookie cutter"". That is, if you take away the cover and some words in the text, it could be a routine for almost any other sport."
3,Alford's Kiss is Tempting but Ultimately Unsatisfying,"Big Kiss *sounds* funny. It really does. You thumb through the pages and see glimpses of humorous-sounding anecdotes. A musical adaptation of Noah's Ark. Bringing your mother to improv camp. Donning tights and playing Oberon in London. Alford obviously has a wealth of experiences to choose from, and there are several laughs and chuckles lurking in the pages of his memoir. He's obviously an extremely intelligent and observant person, and has the vocabulary and eye for detail to prove it. But it's the decidedly un-funny tone - and perhaps Alford's own disillusionment - that ruined the book for me. Maybe that's just because I'm a struggling actress as well and was hoping for a little note of hope to balance out his cynical, dry observations. Reading this book was like reading a dry shell - it's got the talk, but it failed to produce the walk."
4,Building a character,"Acting has always been a profession of chaos, but in Henry Alford's book we see how the chaos is creatively used. Turning the most mundane of tasks into acting ""gigs"" Henry gives us a bird's eye view of the hunger to act. Of course he lacks in the desperation having a profitable and flexible day job, but we can overlook that from the numerous humorous annecdotes that fill his biography. Being an actress myself, I see how I try and fill each moment creating a character and working retail for people who just don't care. I highly recommend this for anyone in the ""business"" or just curious enough to see how difficult the ""business"" is."
5,excellent,"Clear, concise and to the point. The author is direct and plain spoken; the book is thorough and contains lots of tips and tricks."
1,Worthless,"I was hoping for at least a few templates in the CD part of the book. Templates allow one to explore the funcionality of the program and expand on one's knowledge, if any. I was very dissapointed. There are NO TEMPLATES IN THIS BOOK!"
5,"Great Building, Great Story","This is an excellent work that details the history of the Empire State Building. I was a bit surprised to find how much the author managed to pack into my paperback. Everything from skyscraper height restrictions to land leases and modern restructuring of ownership for tax purposes (and all the ""interesting"" stuff in between). If you buy this book and you're not from New York, do yourself a favor and get a map of the area. So you can follow along in the early chapters."
5,Just back from Belize 5-25-00,This was the best of the 3 guide books that we bought and read before we went to Belize. The information was helpful and accurate. It is now all beat up because I carried it during heavy rain during my trip to Tikal.
4,Very helpful guide to travel in Belize,"I purchased this book and several others to assist in my research prior to visiting Belize. This paperback was the best of the bunch. The many small maps are very helpful. I still carry a real navigation map but find the small flip maps very handy. I found this book to be just a cut above the ""Lonely Planet"" book on Belize.I was impressed by the accuracy of the insightful descriptions. This was of greatest value the more remote and less traveled ares of the extreme southern coast.Buy the book and you too will want to experience this land of extremes."
3,The Kindle Edition has no Index,So my 20 word review is that this is a difficult book to use if you just want to look something up. Plenty of info - just confusing and difficult to find.
4,Came in really handy.,This book made planning our trip a lot simpler than it otherwise would have been and let us pack more into each day so we weren't wasting time.
5,Social Controversy with a Smile,"Never afraid to tackle controversial subjects, Lou Grant forages ahead of the rest. From Abortion issues to political graft and intrigue, this series stuck its head out and challenged advocaries to come out their holes and into the Light."
3,Snazzy leather,"This is a great item to protect your Handspring Visor's screen, but unless it is the only item in your purse or briefcase, it's going to get banged around and your PDA will not be protected from dust.Every time I pull mine out of my purse, it's covered with lint from tissues or one of the other 9 million items I've got flying around in there. The slot for the stylus is not secure as it is in the Handspring itself, so if you put a stylus in there, chances are that it will fall out and be buried in the bottom of your handbag.The leather is supple and fine quality, but if I was going to look for a new cover/protector for my Handspring, I would get one that would enclose it completely and protect it from dust, moisture and jostling."
4,Only one thing I don't like,"I like everything about this case except the velcro closure. I'm often in places where I need to be quiet, and that noisy velcro is a pain for me!"
3,Good except for velcro,"I like the slots for the credit cards, Visor snaps wellinto slot, etc... but the Velcro has worn out veryquickly and is basically ineffective in keeping thecase closed. Would prefer a snap or zipper case."
1,Not a very Christian attitude towards others,"I was very impressed with this author's credentials......a bible scholar, a speaker a bible conferences, books recommended by Christians leaders and speakers. The first chapter was very interesting - about Ezekiel - then he really disappointed me. His writing was very anti-Catholic. As I paged through the book, I saw this anti-Catholic attitude throughout the book.I tossed the book into the rubbish. I couldn't even bring myself to send it back or to give it away as a donation. To me it was rubbish.I feel that if you are selling a book as scripture study or as a concordance, it should be just that, scripture study - NOT be full of anti-Catholic statements."
3,who are we,"i needed this book for a class at school, information in the book was good but it was also boring"
1,"You are a bad,bad mexican (learn english at least)","I have to admit that Prof. Huntington is one of the best right wing writers. This is not just plain propaganda but a rational discourse. The problem is that contain little ideas. After thousands of percentage, statistics and numbers the main idea is that mexicans do not want to learn english, they are catholics and they are a threat to the anglo saxon culture. Tacos, fajitas and indigestion is the only things this brown horde could bring to this white, blonde and never imperialistic America. This barbarians with sombrero dare to work 12 hours a day, earn minimum wages, create wealth for the 1% , but they cannot speak a single word in english. Shame on you!!!"
4,"Honest, Challenging Talkwise Political Correctness",Dr. Huntington's book caused alot of upheaval in academia because it dared to say what others will not out of fear of disrupting the multicultural establishment. This book asked the difficult questions which demand honest debate and tough answers. I would encourage anyone to read this who is interested in the cultural transformation our nation has undergone over the past fourty years and where we are heading.talkwiseblog
1,"Old wine, new bottles","Here Huntington misunderstands America and American history in this poorly-researched, mummified jeremiad aimed at latino immigration.Note that similar books and articles attacking US immigration policies have appeared throughout our history, from the waves of Irish immigration in the 1820s and 1840s to the policies that allowed the Chinese to build the railroads. Fortunately, our relatively open immigration policies and diversity have always won out against the nativist critics like Huntingon."
4,..a good extended essay..,"..I am a novice when it comes to political commentary. I found this easy to read, to comprehend, and to understand. This book gives an interesting answer as to why America is in the condition it is (and it's neither a Democrat or a Republican reason). The author gives a hypothesis, and then backs it up with some pretty stable facts/figures. A must-read for any political science student/major."
3,Anything New?,"From the perspective of Central Europe, Prof. Huntington writes nothing new. He invented the word of the ""Homo Davos"". Most American leaders don`t seem to me integrated in the global community. It seems they have their own parallel universe. That is how they are, Prof. Huntington!"
1,Pseudo-Intellectual Racism,"Nothing more, nothing less. You can dress it up with genteel innuendo and a Harvard pedigree, but the basic agenda (White Supremacy) is at root no different than the saltier fantasies of young neo-Nazis or the KKK.As greater numbers of the nation's white elite begin to panic, they will flock toward the cleverly muted xenophobia of Huntington's ilk as a way to politely dig in their heels. In the process, hip soccer moms & Nascar dads will slowly be forced to expose more and more of the veiled anglocentrism that quietly informs their lives. And I doubt that our new multicultural majority will go down without a fight.Huntington's impending race war WILL happen in our lifetime. Can you guarantee which side you'll be on?"
2,Not nearly as good as the first two . . .,"Unless you enjoy a military novel with some mediocre melodrama thrown in for good luck. I was mightily impressed with 'Hangman' and thought 'Rules' to be adequate, but the 'Devil' seemed to leave all of the intrigue and suspense back in Fitzduane's castle in Ireland. The next one will probably feature Hugo chasing The Hangman's former accountant into outer space to recover his lost tax statements. I'm likely being too harsh, but I really wish O'Reilly would spend some time give his great character the kind of plot he deserves. Enough with The Hangman already. S P O I L E R The Hangman died in the first book. Please let him and his schemes (and former associates/lovers/housekeepers) stay dead with him and try writing another story for Hugo."
1,Flat Footed,If I was 14 years old I MAY have enjoyed this book. In fact I think it WAS written by a 14 year old. Really stupid and in my opinion poorly written.
1,LOVE AND THE RUSSIAN WINTER...,THIS IS THE WORST C.D. I HAD EVER BOUGHT. HARD TO BELIEVE IT IS SIMPLY RED. MICK? WHAT HAPPENED? BLASE' ....
4,"Not his best, but it is great.","A few weak songs, but some real heavies in there like ""Thank You"". I rate this one as the 4th best of Red's stuff. Life, Stars, Blue, then this one. I know that a lot of purests will call me names because they like the earlier stuff, but I feel they fall that way. Buy this one - can't go wrong."
3,Predictable.,"Over the years I have purchased SR's CD's unheard at the time of purchase and I was very rarely disappointed. However 'Love and the Russian Winter'starts off with a rip off of a 70's pop song. (can't recall the name.) All the following tracks (not songs) become so similar it's hard to tell them apart, the same tempo, chord structure and key runs through each and every one. The lyrics in some (songs)are so inane they come to close to insulting one's intelligence. Yes, I'm disappointed as this is music by numbers and to a formula, not by the heart! SR, please change producers!"
2,Dissapointing,"My first contact into SR's music was with ""Stars"". It was a great album, and i loved the fact they composed real great R&B; songs without giving up too much to electronica and giving some room for experimentation. Though i basically don't know their older albums, SR was a band worth listening and following. That is why i bought ""Russian Winter""... and what a dissapointment.The cd is basically plain, dull and with no feeling. Joyness is not Hucknall's business, and the songs sound fake, with no feeling, or with emotions being stretched. Do not buy it. You won't regret it."
2,Fourth Listening -- Fading Hope,"I have to agree with the earlier review by the ""Princess."" We love his voice. But this is simply not a CD with the musical or emotional range of other '90s SR efforts. I liked Mick's last three outings -- Stars, Life and Blue -- about equally well, for reasons too detailed for this late-night message. On this new CD, though, we can all enjoy ""Ain't That.."". But there are no other standouts, such as previous hits ""Fairground,"" ""Something Got Me Started,"" or the song ""Stars"" itself. ""Russian Winter"" songs just seem too abbreviated, too mid-tempo, not particularly heartfelt and in the end, not very memorable. Buy their earlier work and you will have some real keepers."
3,What a broad will do for a buck!,"The reply he gave when told of the book,whose reply?, who do you think,all in hearsay of course, but i believe it.Maclaines current outing is quite enjoyable really, apart from when she takes of into phycobabble,boring,in other tomes,too serious to be a good storyteller,suprisingly in this she is different,couldve dropped a few more juicy titbits,she has probably seen it all,her tales of the mafia are fasinating,that dry detached realism of hers,really suits such a subject maybe she should write a book about them sometime,but her insights into sinatra are truly fasinating,actually they are confusing,was she cutting his throat,or what,this is what baffles me,on one page calling him god,on another icily tearing him asunder,for to sinatra disloyalty,was the greatest sin of all,what i would not have given to be a fly on the wall of a reasturent, when mclaine walked in and met him after this."
3,Ugly sink mat...,"This sink mat works well, but it is ugly, at least in my white porcelain sink. The color is not white, more of a dingy greyish-white. Since these are inexpensive, I'm going to replace it as soon as I find one more a true white."
3,Dissapointing,"Paging Joel McNeely! He did a better job copying a dead guy--Bernard Herrman's Marnie than Schifrin did Schifrin. The track samples on Amazon are too short to reveal the differences between this recording and the original film accompaniment although this version is better than the original one. ""Just Coffee"" is good. What's worse are the absent cues: restaurant scene, newspaper box/TV dinners, ""Miss Simmons doesn't answer."" , and the closing credits' guitar and flute duet.I recommend you do what I did. Get the dvd and record what's missing to form your own compilation although one has to put up with some sound effects and dialogue. It's too bad it doesn't come with a separate audio track; but at least it's stereo unlike Goldfinger and OHMSS."
5,Excellent CD,"A ""must"" for any ""Bullitt"" fan. Lalo Schifrin's music score serves as a reminder of how a movie SHOULD be scored.Recording quality is surprisingly crisp.As usual, Amazon's careless handling practices results in a cracked plastic CD case, so remember to have a spare handy."
3,good for the price,"These speakers went into my OEM door speaker holes, and the hole pattern was just perfect.They felt kinda light outta the box, and Im not getting any clear sound out of them, I think I may not be giving them enough power, so I guess I need an amp to really test them out. Wish me luck LOL."
5,Track listing,"(NOTE: This is a full length CD, not a CD single)Track listing:1. We've Only Just Begun2. I Will Always Love You3. Amazing Grace4. Always on My Mind5. Georgia on My Mind6. Chariots of Fire7. The Wind Beneath My Wings8. You Light up My Life9. Star Dust10. Green, Green Grass of Home11. The Way We Were12. Crazy13. Let It Be Me14. Yesterday15. Send in the Clowns16. You Are the Sunshine of My Life17. Misty18. Unchained Melody19. Memory20. Are You Lonesome tonight?"
2,Disappointed,"Reading the item description listed on Amazon, I was lead to believe that I was purchase a Vornado product. What a disappointment, when I saw the package, instead of Vornado, it's from Best Air and the filters seem of inferior quality with larger space in between. I've always had good experience from Amazon. Disappointed with time."
2,Sometimes has a fishy smell,"They certainly work but sometimes they have a really bad musky, fishy smell.I don't know if it's a random problem w/ the manufacturer or I just got a few members of a bad batch, but the traditional ones tend to be more consistent."
2,Depends which filter they sent you....,I received the filter fairly quickly. Put it in my Vornado humidifier and my whole room smell like stinky sweat! I have to disinfect my room! Sent an e-mail to the seller complaining about it and received a response promptly stating that they carry 3 types of Vornado filters and the one they sent me was an AFTERMARKET. They resent me the original one in a few days. At least they admit what they did and try to fix it. Just wished they would have sent the real thing in the first place.....
5,Better than what they gave new in the box!,These filters work better than the ones that came new in the box with the humidifier! They wick the water all the way to the top! Where the others wicked the water only about 3/4 the way up. They seem thicker and are a perfect fit! Leaves no gaps! The original ones had slight gaps around the edges providing a route around the filter instead of through! Im very pleased!
4,you'd think you're watching the anime,"Here's my eval:Pros+-voice acting is great-large character roster-versus mode allows you to play w/villians-great presentation (there are various sceneries, well-executed moments, awesome character interaction, flashbacks from the anime, and tons of special moves taken from the show)-makes decent use of the nunchakuCons--no awesome opening/closing theme music included. Just your standard, mediocre video game music.-tons of backtracking-gameplay is nothing special-no next-gen graphics (the standard for all wii games)-targeting your opponents is a tad bit annoying (the other control settings are solid)You'll enjoy this game if you're already familiar w/the characters. I gave it a four because I really like the characters."
4,An adventure you won't soon forget!,"To be a game based off an animated program, this game really has alot going for it. The battle system can get pretty old and is rather easy, but its well balanced by extremely tough boss fights that you really have to think through. Its not a game for kids in the least bit. This is a serious adventure game that you really have to think about to beat.That being said, it has a ton of content and is a decent length. Its seriously worth being picked up by fans of the show, anime fans in general, or people who own a Wii and simply want a good lengthy adventure!"
4,Unlimited fun,"As a fan of One Piece I'm slightly biased, but this game is lots of fun nonetheless. It has tons of gameplay value; my bro and I clocked 60 hours before retiring it. The experience of collection and item creation isn't for everyone though, but I liked seeing the crew and their campsite grow. The One Piece story is somewhat filled in by flashbacks, but if you're not a fan it would be confusing. However, even if you're not a fan, this might make you one."
3,Looking good.,I just picked up this leather case for [price] in the bargain bin at Future Shop (...) and I must say that it was a good deal. The feel of the case is nice (as its leather) and my Visor Prism clips in nice and tight. The only down side is that when it's closed the cover tends to rub up against the face of the Visor and I'm actually seeing some of the blue finish rubbing off and showing the black plastic underneath. Not good. After spending so much money on this unit you want to keep it in as good condition as you can. I would recommend getting another type of case that provides adequate protection with a clip in type mechanism that has a cover that doesn't rub up against the finish.
2,its just ok,"ok book, but details are not relevant to all models and these specific model differences are not always noted."
1,Ugly! Yukerz...,"Omigosh, I am the Master of all the stuff on Sailor Moon, and when I took a look at these toys, the first word out of my mouth was, EWWW! These dolls look horrible. It isn't the same thing to have a very ugly toy to play with, compared to something that actually looks real."
4,Perfect for making your own invitations,"This book was all that we needed when we made our invitations. You could probably find the information you need online, but it was nice to see everything complied together and I could reference it easier."
2,"Good Overview, Beware the Details","This was a decent, even good, overview of the period. Regrettably, I found that on issues and areas outside the author's later expertise, there were just too many facts that were wrong. The book was published in 1982 and there's been no subsequent update in the intervening 25 years, so that should tell potential readers something."
3,"Not an easy read, but view changing","Although I did not find most of the book pleasurable, I did find it worthwhile. It made for great discussion for book club. We were in agreement that it read like a textbook, but made us look at the situation in the Middle East with a new perspective."
2,Not Balanced - One Sided,In the novel there are many examples of Tolan being partial to one side of the conflict. There are also many contradictions and the use of poor journalism.For example in the case of the supermarket bombing of which the main character was involved there were multiple deaths. When people die the guilt of manslaughter is not reserved for the person or people who set off the bombs but also those who also aided and planned the attack. Tolan's assumption that the main character did not set off the bomb does not clear this man of murder and a judge has the right to render a murder verdict. Simply saying that he was wronged by losing his home decades prior does not excuse murder.
5,peace in the middle east,"This book was recommended at a lecture by Dr Gandhi, grandson of Mahatma Gandhi, that I attended. The world needs peaceful solutions in the middle east and to acknowledge the ethnic cleansing that is occurring in Palestine by Israel. This book is an important read in understanding the human conditions present in the conflict without blaming, but hoping for a better future."
4,Very enlightening,"It is amazing the increased depth of `understanding' I have now for the issues facing Israelis and Palestinians. It is a fascinating history portrayed with finesse and sensitivity via this author and his linking the large events to the more human, personal struggles of two families.How I know this book is enlightening is this: I read the news yesterday and actually understood what I read about what is going on this week over there. I mean I really understood it, and I cared...and it didn't feel like it was happening a million miles from here. Even for someone well traveled and educated, this issue's context has been elusive for me.I wanted to learn, and this book helped me do that using facts and real human perspective."
4,The Lemon Tree,Found this book very interesting. To think of giving up my home to someone else was very disturbingI do not understand how a country can just come in and displace someone. It did have a wonderful friendship formed. I find that non fiction is much more interesting than fiction . We need more people like those in this book.
5,"Very well written and researched, explains why the Israeli/Palistinian Conflict is so difficult to resolve. Focuses on families","Puts the conflict in showing the effects of 2 real families- 1 Jewish, 1 Arab and traces their histories over a 60 year period. The book reads like a very well written novel, not a history."
4,Enjoyed the book,I learned quite a bit from reading this book - it seems unlikely that the Israel/Palestine issues can be resolved but this book shows that an Israeli and Palestinian can have a friendly relationship.
5,Putting a Human Face on the Israeli Palestinian Conflict,"This is a readable account of the evolution of the Israeli-Palestinian situation during most of the 20th century. It uses a brilliant device of following a Palestinian who left his home as a refugee child when the Israeli state was established, and an Israeli who moved into that same house and grew up there. Of comparable ages, the two turned out to be exceptional individuals who established a long lasting if improbable friendship. The evolution of their lives, and the final use of the house with the lemon tree as a center for Jewish-Arab dialog, provides a counterpoint to the more traditional history focusing on politics and conflict. Those who are looking a peace-bringing solution to the conflict will be disappointed with this book, but those seeking ways to understand and empathize better with both sides of the conflict will like this book very much indeed!"
2,No such thing as Palestine,"There is not nor has there ever been a nation called Palestine. There is no such nationality as a Palestinian. It's a made up word. Bashir Khairi is the poster child for why there is no peace in the Middle East. These people who call themselves Palestinians were inhabiting a land that was not theirs. This business of Bashir Khairi and his ilk insisting that they have a right to return to their ""homeland"" is a total crock. It never was their land! Please take the time to learn the true history of the region. You might also like reading Larry Miller's article called The Jewish Situation which was published in the Daily Standard 22 April 2002. He tells it like it is."
1,What's missing from the story,"What's missing from this bitter, trashy novel is the part of the story that belongs to 1 million Jews from Arab lands, all of whom were chased from their homes with nothing but the shirts on their backs.In thousands of cases, these Jews died trying to escape from their oppressors--the Arabs and Muslims of the Middle East and Iran. What's also missing from this trashy novel is that fact that half of Israel's population is made up of those Jewish survivors (and their heirs) of Arab and Iranian persecution in lands that they cannot ever safely visit again, no matter what.Not only did they lose everything, but they managed to rebuild their lives in a state that welcomed them, when the rest of the world turned a blind and uncaring eye. That state, God bless her, is Israel. I'll probably die before we ever see an NPR reporter tell that truth, in a novel or anywhere else."
1,biased and unfair,this book is asymmetrical warfare: a ludicrous spinfest that rewrites history by simply omitting all inconvenient facts.for shame.
4,Painful but worth it,This is a really painful book to read. It was required reading for my Book Club so I plowed through it.. What a sad history is portrayed painstakingly here. We had an interesting and lively discussion about Lemon Tree . It is a subject that one never dares talk about in mixed company. I was surprised that we could share our divergent views on this subject and remain respectful of one another. I have been recommending Lemon Tree to others. I feel that it is really well worth reading. That doesnt mean it is easily approached. Sometimes you learn more when the going is tough Phyllis Hartt
4,Very well written,This book provides a well-balanced and comprehensive history of the Israel/Palestine conflict. It views the past 50+ years through the eyes of a Jew and a Muslim who are linked together in a very personal way. The book is a great way to get an understanding of how the Israel problem came about. It presents the issues from both the Palestinian and Israeli viewpoint. I've been told that it is not available in Israeli bookshops. I would strongly recommend it for anyone who want to get a better understanding of the situation in Israel/Palestine.
1,Disappointed with all the typos,"While I'm enjoying this book, the number of typos in the electronic version is ridiculous. Who is in charge of proofreading? Is the assumption that e readers are second class citizens and don't deserve to have someone proof the book before they sell it to us? I didn't spend 99 cents on this book and the quality should be better."
3,A critical review,"This is well written book, and it reads like a novel, as other reviewers have noted. Therefore, one can not assume that the stories told are factual. The most contested is whether Arab families were forced to leave by IDF forces or whether they left as a result of Arab leaders prodding, promising them a quick return to land empty of Zionists. I have seen no news reports or declarations from Arab leaders at the time of the creation of the Palestinian refugees that they were forced out by IDF as this book purports. At the same time, there are numerous records, reports, and speeches from Arab leaders calling for Arabs to leave Palestinian to allow the Arab armies unrestricted movement. Also, the occurrence of the Arab village massacre is highly disputed. In the end, it probably will not matter what the true story is. Palestinians are the unfortunate victims of the conflict and many live in deplorable conditions in camps to this day. The solution? Complicated."
2,Biased,The idea for the book was good the conflict from the viewpoint of two families. The early part of the book talking about each family's history was very interesting. But where the book falls down is failing to accurately portray the Israel viewpoint or concerns.
1,the lemon tree,I was unable to finish reading this book. I did think it was too bias although the author is well respectd I cannot recommend this book
1,History lesson,"I read this for a book club. If you are looking for a history lesson, then this is your book. Lots of names, places, dates, and facts to keep straight. Reads like a textbook. I did found the overall theme interesting given the times we are in right now, but this is definitely not a pleasure read."
1,Ignore this book,"This is a deeply flawed, biased , and even dangerous book as it has a veneer of credibility. Some aspects of history are accurate and the beginning of the book presents some almost balanced ,parallel views of what happened to the lives of two families who inhabited the same house after the War of 1948 . However,at the end of the book, the author lapses into a slanted polemic that is strongly biased toward the Palestinians. Throughout, the author recounts the imprisonments of S. Khairi the Palestinian protagonist as though he is an innocent , wrongly imprisoned by the Israelis. Real details of his work in the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestinian and its terrorist activities are not provided, and would be instructive . The authors selective inattention to detail is deplorable. Don't waste your time reading this book."
1,Veiled anti-Israel diatribe,"Pretending to be just a reporter, pretending to be balanced, what he really does present a partial picture for the purpose of disparaging Israel. Of course many readers will love this, because dishonestly trashing Israel is trendy on the left these days. Alas, as for actual insight, or helping us move towards solutions in the region, this work work is a major step backwards."
4,A Human Face for a Long Conflict ...,"This book talks about the human aspect of this long conflict, which has been silenced for long time. While most reviews concentrated about the political interpretation of the story and the author, this is simply a true story. What this story tells us, is that we can find a capacity to accept each other, even if our national and political views are mutually exclusive.I do believe that granting the palestnians the right of return to their original towns and cities will provide the only peaceful solution to this conflict. All other proposals dance around peace but won't secure it."
2,A lemon,"I did not enjoy this book in any context. I felt the subject matter would have been interesting and informative, but it fell short."
2,Well written but profoundly biased,"I picked up this book because of reviews that indicated it would fairly depict both side of the intractable Israeli-Palestinian conflict. I am torn between the 2 sides - whether Palestinians should have the ""right to return"" or whether the Israelis deserve their own homeland above all else and at all costs. Thus, I was disappointed to find that although this book is well researched and well written, it is skewed toward the Palestinian version of each and every event depicted throughout."
3,Ok from what I could tell...,This was bought as a gift for my nephew. My only complaint is that the battery door on the remote kept falling off. Everytime he would drop the remote on the carpet it would pop off exposing batteries. We just taped it into place but when we need to replace the batteries it'll be tough to get to them.
5,love long pants,it means so much to me to be able to buy a pair of jeans that fit me in length. ya who.Amy
2,Self Esteem Study,This item took too long to arrive. The product came packed in an envelope that was so difficult to open one of the books was torn in the process. The actual books were in perfect condition.Thank you
4,More rugged than it looks,"Being plastic with lots of parts, I was concerned that my boy would break the truck within a week but it has actually held up quite well. But then again, it's still winter and he hasn't taken it outside yet! It's very realistic and fun - he loves it."
5,"Years of fun, versatile and durable.","Years of fun, versatile and durable. bought for my twin two year olds and a year out still in perfect working order and one of there favorite toys. A must have for all little boys."
5,outstanding - a real treasure,"The fidelity is marvelous, the singing superb, everything about this recording is the best. It is a lovely, lovely album and it is difficult to believe that he isn't Italian."
4,"""Lady in Pink""","A sweet little book, this is the story of Bonnie, who works as a housekeeper in a hospital. While there, she befriends the patients in the children's ward, and learns how to be in the right place, at the right time, and to do the right thing.An extremely quick read; the subject matter is a little extreme for young readers (topics touched upon include death, abuse, etc), but the writing seems too basic for an advanced reader."
5,Little Style Guide to Great Christian Writing Hits the Mark,"This little guide for Christian writers is quickly becoming my new best friend. Packed full of useful information, I keep it handy whenever I'm writing. As a quick resource for proper punctuation, it's the tops. And, what I find most beneficial is the section ""Writing for Religious Publishers"" -- great detailed information to help me succeed.Brenda Berry-Rucker"
2,Very Frigile Turn-Slide Eyecups (Easily Come Off with Cover),"When I tried to remove the eyecups cover, one of eyecups came off with it. The way of this Turn-Slide feature works is by using a ball press fit on the main body. Once the cup comes off, the little tiny sliver ball will immedetaly fall off, and there's no way you can find it. I would've expected Nikon does a better job than this. Be very very careful when you remove the conver."
4,Sorta too early...,I bought this as a present for my husband. He took it out the day after Christmas and used it at a local nature spot here in MN. He said the views through it were awesome so that I can comment on. Don't know yet about the durability but with the Nikon name and the reviews I checked out it sounds like this is a winner. The transaction went smoothly and the packaging was secure and it came quickly (paid for 2 day air and even just days before Xmas it got there on time. I love Amazon.
2,disappointed,for the price they are a good value but unfortunately one of the lenses was distorted and i had to send them back. i am unsure at the moment if i am going to reorder the same model or look for an alternative. thanks to amazon for a painless return process.
1,Glass,"Made in China. Pay for quality, these are budget Chinese binos. After putting these on top of the pile of cheap glasses I have purchased previously (Pentax), I finally paid for a pair that will last a lifetime.Pass on the cheap glasses."
2,Way too heavy!,"I did a lot of research before buying these binoculars. Unfortunately, I should've compared WEIGHT of different options. Bought these for concert-going, but they are way too heavy to lug to a concert! Really wish I'd have gotten lightweight binoculars, with the same viewing capability. Didn't return them right away, so now I'd lose money if I exchanged them. :/Make sure you check weight, if it's important to you!"
5,Fantastic For beginner to intermediate,"This has somewhat easier exercises and harder exercises. I'm an old keyboard player trying to learn classical guitar. I had electric guitar, basically chords, in the 60s. Classical Guitar is much different as is the fingering, which is one of my nemesis. There are several arppegios with excellent finger techniques to learn. I'm still in the stage where I get my 3rd finger mixed up with my real 3rd finger. So learning the finger tehcniques in here will be invaluable to me.All the others above have mentioned many of the other areas already in this book and have done a fine review job so I'll leave it at that."
1,Classical Guitar Techniques,Was written for the expert. Would be good for someone who already knew the technique. Good company to do business with.
3,Coaching yourself to leadership,I found the five key strategies to becoming a leader very useful. This book is very easy to read and contains many good exercises.
2,Sigma 55-200mm for Olympus 4/3 system,"Despite what some reviewers have stated, I found the IQ produced by this lens to be unacceptable. The lens is cheap compared to the Zuiko 50-200mm or even the Zuiko kit 40-150mm and it gives a nice focal range but that's about it. Images are soft (unless the lens is stepped down to f8.0, which becomes a problem in moderate to low light conditions) and it produces a yellow cast, visible in most shots. I should have listened to the many negative reviews I came across and avoid it. In the end, I sent it back to Amazon for a refund. I won't recommend it not even if you are on a budget. Save you money util you can afford something better. I bought the Zuiko 70-300mm instead and that's one great lens...worth every penny!!!"
4,What more can you ask?,"People, If you are like me, a little short on cash but dying to get shots of those birds and squirrels on trees or your childs action shots from his soccer game, BUY THIS.As most people have said, there are a set of sacrifices you make with this lens, but hey, SIGMA has sacrificed enough to get this at your disposal. And trust me, what you gain out of this one is worth more than what you loose. It gives you a good output, although a little stiff on the zoom ring. The images might be a little on the softer side, but it does it's job well. Go ahead, play with this one while you save for a much expensive lens."
3,see way out there.,"I do not often shoot with a telephoto lense but like to have one in the bag for the long shot of the buffalo way out there on the range. Optics are good, not problems, worth the price paid."
1,Never Buy Sigma!,"I purchased this lens for my Evolt 300 - and it has given me nothing but grief!! When I change from the original lens to this, the autofocus does not work. The same thing happens when I change from this lens back to the original. I regret the money that I paid for this lens. I will NEVER buy another Sigma product!"
3,So Cute,"Kinda shabbily made, but it's so adorable. It's even missing his arm, and has both swords. It's so cute, hangs from the top of my closet door. Yes, I'm probably too old for stuffed animals, but who cares? It's cute."
3,Very worn and dirty,Was disappointed with the condition of this book. I knew it was used but the condition was listed by the seller as being much better than it really was. I won't let my grand children use it because it is so soiled. Very dissapointed.
3,Good area info- needs to be updated!,"This was an excellent resource several years ago and I would have rated it at 5 stars. But, now, it is quickly becoming outdated. I would still recommend it as a basic informational source on the area attractions, but advise anyone planning a trip on these lakes to get some current advice, information and maps from the internet and official sources."
2,There Are Much Better Ways of Learning French,"I purchased this product looking for a cheaper alternative to the more expensive language software. As a student with absolutely no previous educaion in French, this program did not help me at all. It starts out right into full dialogue-with no introduction to vocabulary, grammar, or even the alphabet or basic pronunciation. There many activities that are difficult to do, one of the first is when you must listen to several words and phrases in rapid French and type them in-with no introduction to spelling or listening to the most basic phrases. I found myself doing the activities just to get through them, and I REMEMBERED VERY VERY LITTLE. What kept this from a 1 star were the grammar explanation features, and conjugation tool. Immersion may be the best way, but try a much cheaper or even free way first (I recommend french.about.com!) , but don't waste money on an almost useless product."
1,Invest in something better,"I hated this sofware from the beginning. Right of the bat the directions are very poor, and the activities are much to hard for someone with no French background. This is not a program for beginners, so do not buy unless you have a background in French (even if the box might tell you otherwise). I worked through the first CD (supposedly 100 hours worth of material), and I feel as lost as confused as ever. Do youself a favor and invest in a better program."
2,Don't buy if you don't know any French at all,"I realized it too late, but this product is not for someone who has no knowledge of French. I bought this hoping to learn a little of the language - how to say ""hello"" and ""I love you"". It was a big disappointment. Perhaps it good for those who are taking a classroom teaching course, or know a smattering of French."
2,Misleading,"Be aware that the picture is not representative of the product you are ordering. In fact, it is a general review with a variety of questions, not specifically SAT 9. This was not the item I thought I was getting. A waste of my time and now I have to spend more time looking for the SAT 9 review book, further delaying my child's ability to be tested. Thanks."
5,Very nice!,"A very nice addition to your Visor Edge. Soft leather protects your visor and other objects from getting scratched up. I used to keep my visor in my pocket with my sunglasses. I've ruined several pairs of glass, but no more!Also doubles as credit card holder (room for three), and you can tuck some business cards in there as well.The visor simply snaps in place, and doesn't come loose until you want it to.Downside? You can't use this case if you have any modules attached to your visor"
1,There Are So Many Flaws I Don't Know Where To Start,"First I will start with the cover (which is Pretty Funny) the murderer does not even look like that. In the film he is a big fat guy, (for real he is fat!), has a bag over his head with a white smile painted on it, and when you see his real face it has got to be the worst make-up effect ever! Ok, now the kills, they are fake and really suck!! (pretty much being stabbed and lame stuff like that) The acting Blows!! And the sex scene is more funny looking than hot (same goes for the lead actress). The camera veiw does not change as much as it should have. Also......yeah I'll stop. Stay Away from this film and if you ever some how get your hands on a copy of it please destroy the crap. Watch Friday the 13th part 2 if you want to see a guy with a bag over his head killing teens in cool ways, with better camera views, and all that other stuff. FINISH"
2,"Bad advertisement, bad product","You don't need Himalayan salt. They're gouging the price of some salt they mined in Asia to confuse you into buying their product.I'm not satisfied with the ass-backwards way they market salt as a ""healthy alternative"" to regular salt.Sea salt is just as good as ""Himalayan salt"" if not better, and it costs about $1.50 for twice the amount as this 18 ounce bag of junk.It's a marketing scheme. Do your research about salt instead of falling for this scam."
2,Algebra 1 by McGraw-Hill,"My school uses the Algebra I book by McGraw-Hill for the Algebra 1 course. This book does not teach concepts well; just by flipping through the pages, one can tell that it is filled with problems, but has few explanations or examples. If you have a choice, only use this as a workbook, as it does have some good problems."
1,Don't buy this book,"Don't buy this book. The explanations are awful, and the exercises are confusing.I was a Math major and my son has this book. Sometimes I can't understand what the exercises want the students to do."
2,Nice articles but not really that informative,There is really no technical information or specifications in this book. There are many well written articles but they were written several years ago and are just being republished here. Being a long term subscriber to Sports Car Market may be a disadvantage for me in this case. There is a one page price guide that might be useful but it lists a car as a 101 1300 Spider Normale for example while the text lists this car a Giula Spider Normale. The 'What Its Really Worth' section is also a series of republished auction reviews which are several years old.If you want specifications and some insight into differentiating the various years I recommend the Illustrated Alfa Romeo Buyer's Guide.
5,its okay but not the best,this doll is alright but they could of made it better.it looks better than the last doll they made(the one where you lift her arm up and her tiara lights up) it didnt have a nose!its still cool cause its sailormoon but look 4 import ones if you want one that looks EXACTLY like her but come on its just a barbie doll it doesnt need to be her twin.
1,U-G-L-Y,"SO WHAT if this doll has a nose! It is SICK!! No wonder it's so cheap! Look at the odangos! (meatballs) The dolls whole costume is droopy, and it's all made from cheap fabric. please, If you're a die hard SM fan like me do NOT waste your money on this! It's another pathetic atempt by DIC to make sailor moon items look cool."
1,::faints from discust::,"I am an avid fan of sailor moon, and this is just sick. This toy looks nothing, and i mean nothing like sailor moon. it's like the manufactuers watched one episode, and made the doll from memory. it is horrible. do not buy this, there are so many more that look somewhat like the actualy Usagi. this on the other had, looks nothing like her in the face, and has a bad costume. please don't waste your money on this!"
1,IRWIN DOES IT AGAIN,"Just a little advice. If you're a big Sailor Moon fan, look for Bandai Japan Sailor Moon merchandise. It's a little HTF and can get expensive but the quality is so much better than this cheapie."
2,Low Quality,"This doll disappointed me greatly. I'm a huge fan of the show, but the doll looks incredibly [less costly]. Very little went into the making of the doll, from her plastic odangos to her two year old face. I'm sure the doll would be a great chew toy for your dog, but isn't worth mention as a collectable."
5,I love sailor moon!,"I have to tell you I love sailor moon.but this particular one is just ugly!I hate to say they are ugly,but the makers of this toy aren't very good at making a pretty sailor moon.Their head's are big.their shoes are not pointed enuff.boo to Irwin."
3,I'm sorry but this doll looks rather cheap,I think the ones I have at home are better. I think Irwin better use the cartoon for inspiration on the eyes and body mold.
1,Pressures women face?,"Mz Ashcroft clothes this book in scant scripture which leads one to believe that a woman's calling is only ""real"" if it includes her leaving home and children to ""do"" something more worthy. The scripture she chooses - the Mary/ Martha scene - is drawn out to stretching point. Mz Ashcroft ignores pertinent scriptures like Titus 2 verses 4 & 5. One finishes the book thinking what is a ""calling""? Also, as a white South African woman I took offense at the comments about such. It smacks of the very judgemental attitude that the author professes to eschew."
3,Definitely not a high end machine,"The clock is fine and keeps time as it is designed but the parts are very cheap.+ The radio receiver works well.+ The clock has a dimmer for those who don't want gleaming lights at night+ The Aux In allows you to punch in your iPod or MP3 player- One speaker gave out shortly after purchase.- The lid closes awkwardly.- The volume control is on a hair trigger and goes from quiet to deafening very suddenly.- The minute adjustment button no longer works.Overall, if you're not using the alarm functions, this clock will work for you."
2,Bad for the light-sensitive,"I'm not inclined to say this is a bad product, but it was a bad experience for me. Even on dim, the display was unfomfortably bright. So, now I can say I traded in an alarm clock because it kept me awake at night.David N. BrownMesa, Arizona"
5,Perfect,This is a perfect clock cd player for my daughter. Thank you for great customer service and for the fast delivery
4,The Great Gilly Hopkins,"Gilly Hopkins is about an orphan girl who is forced into a foster home that does not like it at first ,but learns to like it.It is a heartwarming story with a lot of comedy and swears. All she wanted to do was to be with her mother.This is a great book.BUY IT!"
3,The Great Gilly Hopkins - A Review By Joanne,"I think this book was ok. It's not the best book out there but it was good. It was about an 11 year old girl named Gilly who wanted a home and she also wanted to be wanted. She had moved into her third foster home in less than three years. This house was owned by Maime Trotter, who already had a foster son named William Ernest Teague. Gilly's real mother, Courtney, lived in San Francisco, California. I thought it would have a happy ending but it was disappointing."
5,A great book,"I first read this one day in class last year.We were going to be stuying it.At first,when I read the first 2 or 3 chapters i said ""This is so boring!"" but as i read more I loved it!Its a great story with lots of depth.Its about a girl who is forced to move in with a foster family.Really good book!"
5,The Great Book,"The Great Gilly Hopkins is a book about a foster child who doesn't trust anyone. One day she has to move. She has to live with a little boy who is scared of her and a woman named Trotter and the blind man who lives next door and who always comes to dinner. Gilly really wants to live with her mother, Courtney but she's not allowed to. So Gilly writes a letter to her mother telling her to please send money for a bus ticket so she can live with her Gilly also tells her mother about the awful foster mother and the dumb boy she has to live with. Will Gilly ever learn to love theses people. One day after school she makes a paper plane for the boy, William Ernest and she learns to love Trotter. When her grandma comes will Gilly want to leave trotter and William Ernest? Read the book and find out! If you read The Great Gilly Hopkins I know you will enjoy it."
4,"It's a bird, it's a plane, NO it's the Great Gilly Hopkins","The Great Gilly Hopkins is a really good book. It's full of adventure, sadness and humor. It's a touching story about a young orphan girl named Gilly who struggles with her foster parents. Her goal is to find her mother in California. It takes Gilly a while for her to realize that you need to be careful of what you wish for. The end is very happy, but to know it you'll have to read the book. So read The Great Gilly Hopkins by Katherine Paterson. Happy Reading!"
2,Tom and Karl's review,I don't like this book because the girl is basically whining the whole book because she wanted to see her mom. I didn't like most of the characters because they are all emotional the only character I like is W.e he keeps it real. We like more adventure and action books like holes or hatchet. But besides that I guess the book was boring and there wasn't enough action. The part of the book that I thought was cool was when Gilly taught W.e to stand up for himself.
5,The great Gilly Hopkins,"Gilly Hopkins is an intense young girl, that is an orphan. She is hard to get to know, but is actualy a nice girl. She has been through so much that she seems older than she actualy is. This is a great book. Gilly might be young, but this book is not._ Samantha Woodcock"
3,This is a great book,"The Newbery book The Great Gilly Hopkins is a good book. This book makes me thankful for what I have. For example I have a home and a family to go home to everyday. This book makes you want to finish it right away, because you want to know what happens next. This book tells what problems that could happen to anybody. And Gilly doesn't like that it happened to her. If you read this book you can see what Gilly says and does because she is not happy."
5,our 5th grader is ENJOYING the reading experience,truly one of many great books ordered on line with Amazon...our 5th grader is actually enjoying all the books we've ordered even though they were school assignments...enjoying/reading were never a part of his curriculm before.
3,A sad but happy book.,I just finished Katherine Paterson's book The Great Gilly Hopkins and it was okay. I liked it because it dealt with life and what kids sometimes go through. Gilly Hopkins is a foster child and is sent to a foster family that she doesn't like. I didn't like the book because of the ending. It just let me down. If you are looking for a good book that happens now than this book for you.
3,A Crazy Book,"The Great Gilly Hopkins may or may not be a good book for young kids because of the bad language and bad examples but it is a very good book other than that. It is about a young girl who has been in more foster homes than she can count. She gets sent to live with the Trotters, the strangest family yet. Gilly is makeing a plan for her mom to ""Rescue"" her and it back fires. so she decides it isn't half bad to stay with the Trotters after all.By... my seventh grade reading class"
4,It was pretty good!,"THE GREAT GILLY HOPKINS was a really touching book. The book is about a young, spunky, rowdy girl named Gilly Hopkins. Gilly is known to have a bad attitude, she always complains about her foster parents, and she's endlessly tryng to find her birth mother. This book will be great for you if you like dramatic books!"
4,Characters were well developed and thought provoking,"A young and sensitive girl who is filled with anger and with fear of rejection, learns that kindness and love make a home."
4,A Smart Girl,"Everyone wants a family and a place to call home. That's what Gilly Hopkins thinks. In fact, the name of this book is The Great Gilly Hopkins by Kathine Paterson and it is a splendid realistic fiction book. As you read before Gilly Hopkins is the main character in this book. She is a tomboy with blond hair tied in ponytails that likes to bother boys of bossy. Gilly wants to make a world record of not brushing her hair. She, Gilly wants to get to her mom, Courtney but Gilly gets sent to maime Trotter. Gilly does not like that so she makes a plan to get to her mom. She tries to take a bus but Trotter catches her and brings her home. After a few days Gilly gets to go home with her mom. I would recommend this book to you because it's a very good book and because it has a marvelous ending."
3,OK,I really liked this book in ways and I really did not like this book in ways. Some reasons why I found this book uninteresting is it has nothing much exciting happen. It is not adventures like I like them. So this book might be great for you if you are not a fanatiq about adventures book. This book was good in a way because I like how she has a goal. I always like to read about that. I thought this book was ok if you are a person like me!
1,If you like bad books read this!,If you like books with swearing and brats you will like this book. Gilly is a brat and the author wants you to feel sorry for her. But since she is a brat you can't
2,2 1/2 Not Very Good,"Reading this aloud in class, most of our students, myself included, did NOT enjoy the story. I STILL don't understand the point of it, doing all of the projects & such. The beginning, or the whole first half, is really pretty boring. This litle brat, hating everyone unreasonably except her mother who she doesn't even know. the next thirty-or-so pages, the ""best"" part, she then turns into a loving, caring lil thing for her foster family after attempting to run away. Soon, swamped in her own doings, she is sent away, miserably from her home. The end is a cliffhanger. But, it seems like more of the story is supposed to go on before you are left guessing. Throughout the whole thing, the plot almost never leaves you guessing. You KNOW Cortney is going to come, you KNOW something bad is going to happen to Gilly. Just not worth your time."
1,The Horrible Hopkins,If you need a book to get more sleep here it is dude. This book made me sleep. That is the only good thing about it. It is a good book at the end.It is a horrible book. If you like boring books read this book! This book doesn't have any exciting parts until the end. So there is one thing read this book to go to sleep.
1,Book Review,"I thought this book ""The Great Gilly Hopkins"" was a disappointment. I read this book for my book club and itwas not interesting at all!! All it talks about is details about how she escaped and how her new families kept treating her!! The Author didnt do a very good job on this book!"
5,Fantastic Read...For Adults and Pre-Teens,"Fantastic Book..a great read for any Adults and Pre-Teens..I won't give away too much other than..Many of us may perhaps encounter a person who seems withdrawn and angry...and we label them weird because we don't understand or don't want to unerstand this individual..All I can say is, this person is really not weird but just has their own troubles and there's always a reason why people are angry and withdrawn..Read the book and find out what's wrong with Gilly"
1,Vulgarity has no place in books targeted for this age group,While the subject matter of this book was interesting I was appalled by the foul mouth on the main character in this book. I encouraged my daughter to buy this book from the school book fair based on the summary on the back and the fact that it was a Newberry Award winner.The references to adultery in the part about Gilly disliking church was equally appalling. Luckily I was reading at the time and quickly skipped past as this part really isn't relevant to the crux of the story anyway.I will no longer assume any Newberry Award winner is appropriatly written for the age group.If vulgarity is inappropriate in your house you will not want to purchase this book.
1,the ungreat gilly hopkins,ya. i hated this book. okay. first i will admit that i didnt even finish it becuase it was so horrid. i was shocked. it was racist and mean and offensiveandit hadd some swear words in it. avoid this horrid book
1,The Great Gilly Hopkins,"I hated that book,becuse it bored me and it did not catch my attention. (it was boring)I didn't like the book because I likeexciting storys.To tell you the truth I like excting stories and this one was not exciting."
1,Product for my Coussin,"My little cousin tell me to order for her a aviator glasses, so i order this, and they where like a really cheap product, too plastic, and very ugly detailed."
4,great steampunk accessory!,I saw these at the Franklin institute about a month ago and fell in love with them. They're so much fun and the best part is they fit comfortably over my glasses. Now a few of us at work are doing a steampunk themed Halloween and I saw these on Amazon for half the price they were being sold at the Institute so I jumped at them. They're exactly the same and I can't wait to use them at the Halloween party!
1,"Cheap quality, made for children","I purchased this for an adult. The straps were too thin; about 1/8"" wide elastic if that wide. When I'd hold the googles in my hands, they appeared to be made of low quality plastic and created for a child designed only to last a short time. The band which fastens around the head was so flimsy that we couldn't use it. We ended up not using the googles at all. I have to chalk it up to a lesson learned."
3,Aviator goggles,"Although the product was as represented I was disappointed in it for two reasons. First, with the chrome finish, it is much too shiny. Second, I found these goggles uncomfortable to wear over my glasses.Another person might not object to the shiny finish and a person who doesn't wear glasses might be okay with the comfort. I was wanting to capture the appearance and feel of a World War II pilot or crewmember and I felt these goggles fell a little short of what I was looking for.Otherwise the goggles are fine. I purchased another set of a different type, though, that is more suitable to what I was looking for."
4,Dated but Requisite Reading,"This is dated but sould be read by the aspiring professional and serious amateur. The digital stuff is dated but the rest is required. Many outstanding artists/photographers shoot film/slide media in full format 35mm, medium format or large format. If you fit the descritors above you need to know Ansel Adams work and techniques. When you can photograph in digital color as well as Ansel Adams shot in black and white, you are remarkable!"
3,Learning Basic Techniques,"Well, it's a great book for basic techniques. I bought the 'Book 1' and was able to understand the second one, unless you know about photography, you don't need to read the first book.The 'Book 2' is really the continuation of the first one, and so it continues on subjects like exposure, development and printing. I am disapointed by the chapter on exposure though. I was searching for a deeper understanding on the exposure notion. Still! Great book."
1,Important oversights,"Let me be brief- the menu system is not very good (5 taps of the buttons just to get to the point where you can set exposure compensation) and it does not work with radio slaves. If it isn't actively communicating with a camera the flash will not fire, so if you use pocket wizards you need to get something else."
4,Damned Good Book with one Gripe!,"The ""near future"" predicition of this work is based in enough fact to scare the bejezus out of anyone who pays attention to current events! Character development is thin but acceptable! Plot is straight forward yet gripping! No Flowery prose just straight and true story telling... my only gripe is I feel there is much more story in some original manuscript... It almost seems like the editor was paying by the word and wanted to save some bucks or this novel was cut in two to get a second book! But all in all a good read (I read it in one night!)"
3,Its in the right catagory,"I try to read a lot of these future type books, not thinking that anyone has a lock on reality, but to read as many ideas as I can to see if I can look forward with logic. This one based on the cashless society was a new take on the future. Not likely to happen, but the overreaching Government is surely here now. As far as the book itself is concerned, too many editorial errors, poor proofing, and I found literally dozens of misused words, like they were selected in a thesaurus with a dart. In addition, the author is weak on technical issues. Whether cars, guns, micro hydro power or diving. He apparently just took notes at a cocktail party and scribbled from there. The endless threads leading off nowhere, and the miriad of characters was confusing. Not recommended, and I wont buy the sequels."
5,smashing,"I think Mr. Furlands' book is right on track. They are gathering information on us now. Passing laws getting us closer and closer to disarmament. I found his book very informative and it had some good action in it too. Wish I could read the other 2 books in the series, but I guess they are coming soon."
5,Jerry Furland is the next Tom Clancy!!,"The book ""Transfer"" is a near future look at the world. The author brings factual social events into play and takes it to the next level. These futuristic events are not ""far off"" when one looks at the policies being made today by our leaders. This Book brings home the fear of every citizen of a centralized informational system to track and monitor your life. A MUST READ this summer for anyone concerned with the state of affairs on the future of this country. Be prepared to read this book without stopping until you're done. I suggest that you start reading in the evening and spend a sleepless night wondering how close this book hits home to the path our nation's leaders are taking us."
2,Nice appetizer but where's the entree?,"I enjoyed the story line. Furland is a good writer. The only problem is the story ends 200 pages into a 600 page novel. Granted he said it was the first of a three volume set, with the other two yet to be written, but all other trilogies I have read at least wrap up the loose ends before going to the next book."
4,Nothing's a five,Unlike the previous reviewer I think the humour works though the jokes don't. Unfortunately in the sequel Shaw keeps the jokes and loses the humour. It's a total turkey don't bother with it. I think this is a great book though and routinely recommend it.
4,A fun way to immerse in English,"This CD set is quiet user friendly for foreigners who already know some English, but need to hear the native accent more and to get some interactive simulation. I bought this for a friend in China who worked for a American firm, and she love it."
1,Repetitive and boring,In this game you are required to perform the same shooting task repeatedly until you want to toss it out...very disappointing.
3,Mediocre at best,"The game can be fun but it quickly becomes frustrating. ""Here I am just floating here... WHERE DID THAT D*** JELLYFISH COME FROM"". That is how I experienced this game."
3,pretty simple game,not much to this and very easy to play. i have finished this game in under twenty minutes. i still play it from time to time.
1,The Most Overrated Man In The Underground...,"If Necro were well-known...he would be the idol of a generation..why? because this guy, even if he's underground, spits some vicefull and dirty lyrics. And nowadays..people love it (hum, yes, just have a look at 50cent...hum).I don't like those guys who give a bad vision of HipHop. Sex pervert, addict of violence... I'm waiting for more ""intelligent"" lyrics in HipHop...This guy with no morals makes me sick. Necro is the 50cent of the underground. The production? Frantic, dirty, dark...hum, not fantastic but it would be okay if only the bad lyrics weren't here.I think Necro should spit his crap elsewhere and outta the HipHop culture. He should return to his pornographic films and should write music for horror films..If you like stupid lyrics, dat's for you. But if you want an intelligent HipHop, there are thousand of artistes better than him."
4,Interesting listen.,"Necro is definitely different. He loves death, porn, and more death. The guy has a lisp and his flow stumbles and shows an awkwardness on the mic, but his voice is perfect for what he's talking about. I don't consider him a good emcee, but one of the most entertaining. When I throw any of his albums in its more like watching an old horror film like Evil Dead or something than it is actually listening to music. He's graphic to say the least, but to his credit he NEVER comes out of character. The reason this got 4 stars though and not 3 is because of the production. Some of the beats on this album are incredible and I'm suprised every single underground artist isn't trying to hit him up for some music, because its some of the most impressive, you couldn't screw it up with the weakest rhyme. If you're a head and you can understand that this is just music, than I'd definitely recommend getting this album. Its good."
3,NOT 5 STARS....,"...honestly only about 2.5 or 3.if this was a beat cd then it would've been a banger but it's not.necro's lyrics just don't cut it.you can tell that he was still trying to develope his style.stand out tracks are ""the most sadistic"" & ""underground"".the frestyles at the end of the album were decent even though he wasn't really freestyling.i wouldn't by this,i'd try to get it from a homeboy."
4,READ THIS!,Necro a very good mc. I like about 75% of the songs on the album...it is not becuase of his flow or lyrics but his beats lack on some songs. He is very creative and original if you like underground hip hop check out binary star they are phat overall i give this album a 4 solid but could be better like i said just the beats lackin a little.........
3,um...,"is anyone here onto the fact that this is Kool Keith? (that's right, the guy Eminem rips off.) Please tell me you listen to Dr. Octagon twice a day, call me in the mornin'. I gots the Ultramagnetic MC's '88 joint on the hitbox, flyin from the back. Get serious y'all."
2,Half happy,"2 1/2Semi-impressing electro-gurgles envelop best when rhythmically developed to offbeat samples, though by the end GC fades into a haze of absorbed ambiance."
4,Quality follow-up to 'Sakura',"It was always going to be difficult to follow up his previous masterpiece of an album, but he has managed it with style and class.A bit more heavy on the percussion than the previous album, 'Grinning Cat' is nonetheless a very good album. It pursues the same themes and sounds as 'Sakura'.'Sakura' will always be in the minds of people, so when this album is being discussed it will always be in the former album's shadow. I feel this is a shame as it stands alone itself as a great album.In simple terms, if you enjoyed 'Sakura' then you will very much enjoy this."
1,Don't Waste Your time!,Looked into this for a simple billing interface for my private practice. It is almost unusable with no directions or support.
3,a little confusing,"not a bad book, but some of the pages are a little confusing, and from what i've seen so far, there's no explinations on how to answer the questions. but i haven't been through the whole book yet."
2,Very boring,"This is a very formulaic show--nothing special. The stars aren't even sexy, and where are the memorable lines or closings? This is a run of the mill show. If you want good drama, comedy, and legal cases--watch Boston Legal."
3,"Great series, poor box set","Loved the show and was unhappy when I heard it had been canceled so quickly. So why am I saying the box set is poor and giving it three stars? Two words: full screen. Sorry guys, but I didn't buy an HDTV and an anamorphic-capable DVD player to watch this thing with huge black bars on the left and right side of the screen. As the show was shot in 16:9 (resulting in even less black bars on normal full screen displays) it was a crime (no pun intended) to release this as anything less than 16:9 anamorphic.And FYI: all the other Law & Order box sets are the same way (full screen, no 16:9 anamorphic support). Maybe when they do TV shows on Blu-ray I'll finally be able to purchase a set that looks good on HDTV."
1,Godless liberalism...ridiculous and pathetic....,"This series started off bad...got better and then got absolutely horrible. It made me sick. A homosexual that was killed was refered to as ""she"". And at the end of the show the father who killed the transvestite who was having relations with his son was told that he had killed a 115 lb ""girl"". And had sacrificed his only son on the altar for the sake of his own pride. Demonic overtones coupled with godless and ridiculous liberalism. No wonder this show flopped. If it was still on tv....I would never tune in again. Stick with all the other Law and Orders. Also try ""Homicide, Life on the street"". It is very very good. One detective goes a little gay during the end of its run, but besides that it is really good."
4,Why is this still not on?,"I really enjoy the original Law and Order series and still watch it all the time. I admit that I never saw the Trial By Jury series when it was on prime time. I bought the DVD after seeing an episode that was on TNT as it was part of a story that ran on Law and Order. Anyway, this series adds the perspective of seeing the defense team plan its strategy for the trial. I wish more people had watched it (myself included) because this is well done. The stories are intersting and the way the cases are handled were fun to watch. The acting was very good. I've seen all the episodes in the set now. (some twice) This is a set that I will no doubt be viewing more of even after repeated viewings. Love it."
3,lady prosecutor too knowledgeable.,"the lady prosecutor in these series does not reflect a real life prosecutor. just like the lady detective of ""murder she wrote"" , both of them seems to have a crystal ball that they already anticipate anything that is to happen which is quite unbelievable. i would recommend the series ""conviction"" which is more believable and the pacing plus the storyline is superb."
5,Lawyers are the principles of this Law & Order,"This was a great attempt at a trial version of the successful Law & Order franchise. Fred Thompson continues his role of NYC District Attorney. Bebe Neuwirth and Amy Carlson played the ADA's that prosecuted the cases.Each episode started after the completion of the criminal investigation and the case was handed over to the DA's office. This does not mean that the investigation was over. Jerry Orbach, until his untimely death and then Kirk Acevado were the investigators assigned to the ADA's.This was a great series that didn't make it for a number of reasons. First and foremost was a lousy timeslot. And this is the only L&O; franschise that had only female leads. It's too bad that NBC didn't give the show some nuturing.The best episode is the SVU crossover Day with the great Angela Lansbury.I have this on preorder and will give a full review when I get it."
3,Not the best Law and Order spin off,"Not the greatest players in this series. I love Jerry Orbach, who is now passed (he was sick I understand while filming this) but the lead character, Babe just did not have the chops for this role. The other actress was better. Stories were too passive or something. Never finished watching all of them."
3,Disappointed Law and Order Fan,"I love most all Law and Orders, especially SVU, but was disappointed with this one. Not Dick Wolf's finest work. It looks at things totally differently than any other Law and Order. They have also made the theme song all techno like . . . kind of ruined it for me right off. Glad I watched it, but not one I would have bought if I'd seen more of it before and probably not one I'll rewatch again any time soon (I could have SVU on a continuous loop)."
3,Basic and Reliable,"This is a competent, basic compass, suitable for general direction keeping. It is not a precision instrument.The brass safety-pin attachment is weak, and liable to failure. I have lost a couple of these. There is, however, a hole in the mounting plate, that will accept a safety string. (Dope Rope.)The Marbles' pin-on is a standard part of my gear."
2,Little Toy !!,"This is a tiny (About an inch) Compass that works just in 180 ( has to be placed on a leveled platform), otherwise won't work!!So then what's point of pin on??!!"
4,Viva Holdsworth...,"This guy is definitely channeling Allan Holdsworth - he's even using Holdsworth's drummer. He uses a little bit more of a traditional tone, but a very similar approach to the guitar. So, if you like Holdsworth, you'll really like Steve Topping.I dig this recording a lot. My guess is that people will fall into one of two categories - they will either ""not get"" it, or they will love it."
5,British maestro Steve Topping displays utmost diversity,"For those unfamiliar with Steve Topping, you are missing a masterful guitarist whose virtuosity and diverse playing is unmatched. Topping runs the gamut from blues jams (Blueways) to the Tony Williams-influenced ""Son of Spock."" Well worth the investment."
5,Fit perfectly,"I received what was described and in perfect condition. It was not very difficult to install. If you are a novice mechanic don't worry, everything was pretty easy to understand once you were under your car. I have a 1997 Honda Accord 4 door. The mesh part of my exhaust had rusted out and made the car very loud. After installation the loud sound was gone and the car felt/drove great. I also purchased a round gasket and triangle gasket that was recommended and I was very happy I purchased both as they were needed for each end of the pipe. I would definitely recommend this resonator to anyone that has a need."
3,Don't plan on playing the CDs on your computer or DVD player,"O.K. it's a good program, that's why I bought Berlitz. Millions have used it. But none of my three computers would play the CD's nor would my DVD player. I dug an old boom-box out of the closet and the CD's played fine. So they must have done something to the format of the CD's so that digital devices won't recognize them (probably some copy-protection thing). But it's just not convenient to drag yet another device along with me (laptop, mp3 player, phone and now a bulky CD player??). I think they should have prominently advertised this lack-of-compatibility."
1,Berlitz Deluxe Language Pack French (Berlitz Deluxe Language Pack) (Audio CD),"This is one of the worst examples of teaching I have the dis-pleasure of working with. Most of the examples run long numerous phrases with the translation at the end. Many times you are asked to guess what is being said. I didn't purchase this to guess. There are few direct translations from English to French. I am instructor myself, and if I were to teach with this poor example attitude I would be fired within a week. I would have give half a star but there no provision for it that I can see. The packaging is great to bad Berlitz spend more time on proper teaching methods. So, don't waste your money."
3,Early U2 for collectors.,"Nice couple of early live tracks, but I was hoping for the studio version of ""11 0'Clock Tic Toc"". The two rare songs are worth the price of the disc."
3,Product Switch,"Product is fantastic but.... Buy only from a known and trusted seller, or make sure seller comments include ""as pictured/described"". At least one seller claimming new product (with no disclaimers) is delivering a cheaper, discontinued CD stack: no box or bonus and MSRP $30.00 less. That is a different product with a different UPC, different title (not ""box set""), different picture and description. After a month of lies, Amazon took over and is investigating seller."
3,"you cheated, you lied","I bought this so called BOX SET as a christmas gift. Didn't get the thing til after new years, and to add insult to injury they came as lose CD's not in the box pictured. It made a crumby looking gift since I printed out a picture of the box and gave it because of the late delivery. I'll think twice before I order another so called BOX SET from amazon. Just for the hell of it, look up the ton of emails I sent you guys about the problems I had with this order. That will explain a lot. We love the music, the three stars is for amazon!"
3,Not as advertised!,"Received the CD's today, but I was not real happy. Amazon advertised this collection coming in the colorful 45's box and an extra CD, but I did not receive either. The CD's came taped together. The music is great, but you will not get the box or the extra CD and that was the reason I ordered from Amazon in the first place. I was really surprised coming from Amazon. They are normally great, but I was dissapointed this time."
5,You get what you pay for.,"Just got my copy of ""70's Music explosion"" and it was exactly what I expected. Nowadays if you can buy something online and get exactly what you expected, you're doing very well. Please don't get me wrong I hate Time-Life's guts. Their politics in the past dealing with various parts of the broadcast and satellite industries have been atrocious. Another reason to hate them is the prices they charge for these CD collections. $15.00 a CD for mostly public domain music? You gotta be kidding! But here's the catch: Of all the nearly 200 selections in this collection there was only one or two filler songs and maybe even they weren't because I just didn't know them. Second catch: Absolutely every selection was trancribed (Remastered) as well as possible from the original master tape. What are you gonna do? Sometimes you have to give the Devil his due."
4,70's music,The cd's arrived sooner than I had anticipated for which I am glad. The condtion of the cd's were excellent. One of the plastic cases had a fine hair line crack in it but it had not damaged the cd. The teeth that hold the cd's in place were missing in 2 of the cases but that had nothing to do with the sender. They were all factory wrapped. I'm satisfied and would do business with them again.Thanks.
4,Underrated sax player,"I bought this for Can you Tell, but there's some other great jazz funk tunes on here."
4,A Nice Surprise,"I was surprised by this game. When I bought it, I was desperate for a new adventure game so I decided to give this one a try. I lucked out. This game was actually clever and interesting and had several different endings depending on certain choices you make near the latter part of the game (If you buy it, make several distinct saves during the last quarter of the game.). The main activities in the game are exploring DaVinci's villa and making his devices work in order to progress through the game. Don't be put off though, the puzzles aren't too difficult and most of the time you know what you should be doing. This game has a sound storyline and the puzzles fit nicely into the story. There are no mazes or slider puzzles and you don't have to incinerate any zombies."
4,Fun game but the price difference was surprising,I enjoyed the game. I reserve 5 stars for Siberia. I was most surprised at the price. $14.45 is in line with the original price. It is even less now from other sellers. I don't know how Amazon thinks they will get $83.98 for the game. I wonder if anyone actually paid that price.
3,Gets dull pretty quick,"I played the demo for this game and really enjoyed it. That lead me to buy the full version. Unfortunately, I found that the demo was the most enjoyable level of the game. The level of detail is wonderful and you really feel like you are there in DaVinci's manor (as much as the point and click interface will allow).But ... after level one, you start to feel like you are the handy fix-it-up man around the house. You start fixing things. Which, to me at least.. can get a little dull. You also start collecting ingredients. There are many times where you have to combine several collected ingredients. Those and mechanical puzzles tend to not be my cup of tea.After level one, I just was not enjoying my experience with this game. Everything takes place within the same house and surrounding area too. A little diversion would have been ok. I just didn't feel compelled to continue on. It gets pretty dull, in my opinion."
1,Important Information Misleading,"Hasbro lists 640X480X256 colors as a minimum requirement for this product. Unfortunately, that is the ONLY resolution that will work. You don't know that by examining the box. In fact, you won't know it until the program fails to run.Hasbro Technical Support is no help, as all they do is point out that the software will only run in 256 color mode - which I already knew!My five year old son was VERY disappointed on Christmas day - and so was I.If Hasbro had labeled the product as ONLY running in 256 color mode, I would have known not to buy the software. I expected MINIMUM system requirement to list only that - and not MAX requirements!"
5,Breathtaking Voice,"I love this album. Callie Cardamon' songs are jazzy and thoughtful. Her emotional songs, like Sweet Tuesday, are incredibly heartfelt. Whenever I hear the ones with a playful edge, like Spanish Wine, I marvel at how her voice can be so rich and full of spirit. This is one of my favorite albums to listen to as I'm walking or riding home from work. It makes the trip so much easier."
2,Nothing special,"The title might leave you with the impression that this is a book for job candidates, but it's actually written from a manager's point of view. It does not contain anything that you can't find in every job search book. The ""top answers"" are the standard answers you'll find everywhere. It took me 30 mins to go thru the whole book.The author takes himself too seriously - the first page peddles Oracle scripts from ""the best DBA in the world"" (?); claims that the illustrations are great (?) don't help either.Some of the language is inappropriate - for example there is a sample police record for a fictitious job candidate with last name Scumbag (??)"
5,Amazing...almost speechless....a masterpiece!,"I have to say that I have been just blown away by this recording for some reason, that and the fact my daughter wiggles as soon as the rhythm of the first song begins, knowing in anticipation laughing and giggling. It sort of reminds me of music made by a few great producers of studio trickery, and so this album maybe the best thing I have listened to in a couple of years, thanks to those that made this possible, may you live in music nirvana!"
5,TriEnergetics,"The TriEnergetics Program is an absolutely necessary tool to assist in maintaining a healthy lifestyle in these days of more stress and less time for ourselves. Excellent, easy to understand steps to feeling better and looking better."
4,The book that I prefer,"This is the clearest book about futures markets. If you don't understand about this theme, you have to read this book. It's really easy. Specially if you don't speak english (the vocabulary is limited, fortunatelly).Este es el libro más claro acerca de los mercados de futuros. Si no entiendes este tema, tienes que leer este libro. Es realmente fácil. Especialmente si no hablas inglés (el vocabulario es restringido, afortunadamente)."
2,Silly ....,"Although I like many of Mallery's books, this one was pretty awful.As for the political aspect, as rancid as our politics have become in real life, it just wasn't believable that the mayor would say the things he did during the debate. It would not happen.The overall story wasn't boring, but some of the dialogue and plot lines bordered on absurd. Case in point-the incident in Gracie's driveway-not only was it unimaginative and a juvenile thing to write for adults, it was ridiculous.But the MOST ridiculous scene had to be when Riley was carrying a cake and a cop tried to prevent him from leaving the building. He says ""I'm going to have to call this in,"" and then we hear the voice from the radio say, ""Hold him."" That has to be the stupidest scene ever written in a work of fiction."
2,The sisty uglers,"I was pretty ambivalent about this book--it almost seemed as if it had been written by two people, and I liked one author, but the other, not so much. The two main characters seemed about as believable as the hero and heroine ever do in romances, and their dialogue was unforced and sometimes witty--all good. But the secondary cast of characters--no believability there. Gracie's horrible family reminded me of nothing so much as the evil stepmother and stepsisters in Cinderella--overdrawn, and a family highly unlikely to have produced the heroine. The final straw came at the end, when they suddenly, for no apparent reason, see the error of their ways and profess their appreciation for Gracie. At this point, I threw the book down in disgust--of course, I'd finished it by then, so it was a pretty meaningless gesture, but still."
2,crappy plotting,"There's a lot to enjoy in this book. Unfortunately there's also things that made me nuts. I hated Gracie's family. Her mother and her sisters were all about ""me, me, me"" through the first half of the book. I wanted Gracie to tell them all to go to hell. Then about half way through the mother has an unexplained, completely unmotivated and unconvincing Epiphany and suddenly everything is wonderful again. I so didn't buy it. Then at the climax of the book, *spoiler alert* Riley's ex-wife just happens to leave her front door ajar so Gracie can conveniently get the goods on her without breaking any laws. Yeah. That's a cheap cop-out caused by poor plotting. And all this from a widely published romance author. And people wonder why romance gets no respect. It's not a mystery to me."
5,Good!,I ejoyed it very much. It was a littldifferent than I expcted but still an excellent read.Interesting dynamics
2,Fair / Below average,"Overall, the photos are quite good. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said of the written material. There were a number of errors in plant information. An example was the information presented for the monotypic genus Darlingtonia californica, which contained erroneous information regarding its habitat extending north into British Columbia. The line drawings in this work are quite delightful and worth viewing. Overall, this book would be useful to newcomers into the world of Carnivourous plants, but long time hobbyists should examine other publications for more serious, in-depth information."
1,Unethical Authors,Before you buy this book I would strongly urge you to read this http://www.sarracenia.com/faq/faq6010b.html
3,Alright But there are better,"This book is an okay book. It has good examples of plant experiments which you can do if you have a stable collection. However, I prefer to sit and read Savage Garden by D'Amato and get his more insightful view."
1,Try another book...,"This book bothers me in that it contains many inacuracies on plant culture and distribution. But that's not all. The author has some politically incorrect opinions on wild collection of endangered plants. Try D'Amato's, ""The Savage Garden"" instead."
4,"Good spikes, good value, well worth the money.","Awesome cleats. Look Fantastic. I just wish they(Adidas) would have provided me with extra screws to go with the extra plastic spikes that came with it. Other than that, no gripes. You can't go wrong with these."
1,over priced junk,"I got this for my cat that loves to play in water, and spills it so they have none to drink all day. crazy cat! Although it is serviceable, it certainly is NOT heavy weight. mine came with a dent in it that was too easily pop out with my thumb. It also came with a lovely sticker on the bottom that left glue residue that was impossible to get off with out scratching the finish. Its not worth my time to return it and it is serviceable, but it is not worth $18, maybe $5.99 to $9.99."
4,X-Super Heavy No-Tip Bowls - set of 2,"I am satisfied with the delivery.The bowls arrived a day early, but I was slightly disappointed to see that there was a small crack in the rubber lip wrapping around the bottom of one bowl.Because of my time crunch I chose not to deal with an exchange, but I feel that products should be inspected more thoroughly - especially when they are made for daily pet use."
3,"good plate, poor rubber edge","The plate itself is good, very convenient for my very allergic dog. But I live in a hot and humid city, and the rubber edge didn't last a week!!!"
2,Not as adveritsed,"Although these bowls are functional and attractive, they are not X-Super Heavy nor are they stainless steel (a magnet does not stick). They were cheap enough so a return is not necessary but the description is misleading."
4,not perfect but would buy again,"i have an english bulldog and these are the perfect size for him. would recommend getting a mat to place under the bowls to catch the water/drool and food. i like the design, as he's never flipped them over and can't carry them off. they do get dirty easy but are dishwasher safe.expected them to be a lot heavier and the metal used seems a little on the cheap side. when my dog steps in the food dish its thin enough to push it down and we have to pop it back up. overall though, not a bad price for stainless steel bowls and i do like them. next time i might consider a heavier material such as ceramic"
5,An Essential,"This book is a must-have for serious field hockey players. It provides all the information you need to get in shape and stay in shape. It provides instruction and advice that every field hockey player should know about training. Field hockey isn't just about the game, it's about the months of practise and training leading up to it as well. If you are serious about the sport, I would buy it."
3,Not quite the complete guide,"The other reviews of this book don't quite match up to the actual contents of this guide.This book is a general weight training guide, it can be applied to any sport, and outside of having the word hockey on the front cover there is nothing hockey specific at all about it. There is, in fact, no mention of hockey again after you turn over the front cover.That's not to say it isn't a good weight training guide, but a complete guide it isn't."
5,Very satisfied with seller,I bought this gift for my wife and the posts did not fit her.The seller allowed us to return item and gave us a refund.Very satisfied with sell. Thank you very much
3,Seems Fragile to Me...,"***********************************I ordered this for my nephew's 3rd birthday. When it arrived, I tested it out and even put in fresh batteries. Something was wrong with the one that I got because the voice was garbled and slurred, and the movement was choppy. It seems to be a fragile bank, but since my nephew loves Darth Vader, I quickly asked for a replacement. Amazon.com is great with exchanges because they handled my situation immediately and shipped out a replacement just in time for my nephew to receive it. Otherwise, Darth Vadar is menacing-looking, the sound is unreal LOUD, and the fact that the light-saber lights up as Darth Vader lifts his arm up and around is so cool. Oh, his cape thing is made of soft rubber so there's some movement to it too. The other reviewer said there's no movement when a coin is dropped in...I think that's a defect in his/her bank cuz mine goes through the whole song and dance when I drop a coin in."
4,Darth Vader Bank,Big hit with my 5 year old son. The Darth Vader Bank appears to be reasonably sturdy. No problems. Can't get enough of that theme song ...
3,Cute for kids,"Cute for kids, but really bulky and my son lost interest in it after about a day or so. Ended up not keeping and giving to the Goodwill."
5,A must for patrol work,"I'm a police officer, and we don't baby our gear; we use it. I've run the Blackhawk bag hard and it's always worked well. With my LMT AR15, Rem 870, Glock, and Sig as well as a boatload of magazines, it's heavy but it doesn't bulge, fray, or dump any gear. The zippered pocket is perfect for smaller items, the main side pocket has 3 strong velcro patches and holds everything in tight. The foam padding is heavy enough to protect the guns from abrasions or impact. I've actually loaded it up with 3 long guns and 3 handguns before, but that's pushing the capacity. Just saying that this will take anything you can throw at it and keep working. I prefer the rectangle shape over the rifle shaped ones because when its in the trunk it doesn't automatically scream ""weapons."" All in all an excellent product."
3,It's a nice starting point,I got this because I have just married a German man. We have trouble understanding each other sometime... it's interesting. Knowing a few words help. This was very easy place to start and not to mention fast. It's really a great place to start but I can't put very many sentences together though... I'd still suggest it though.
3,"Not exactly what I wanted, but the best German CD I've seen.","I was thinking of something better and more interesting, but instead, I got a bunch of little games that detract from the objective if you do not improve. I have purchased a different CD that is much worse than this one.If you see this CD first, keep it in your back pocket."
2,If a person has the time this two set cd is a winner,I started useing this product three months ago a couple of hours a night on the average and am now ready for an actual class. I really love this set of cds titled Instant Immersion German. I have learned a lot; this is a winner in my book and I have never had a problem loading it on my pc.. This language set of CD's is good for beginers. My young children love it too; they think it's just plain fun..David G.
4,The Free Zone is a Nice Place to Visit,"Larry Steelman's ""Free Zone"" is a mellow listen with enough edge to keep you engaged. There are essenses of more widely known Yellowjackets and Bob James throughout the eleven tracks. There is a variety of style and texture to appeal to a wide audience. The production is worthy of the fine musicians that join Steelman. Worth having in your collection."
4,"Concise but thorough, a worthwhile read.","Montesquieu's ""Considerations..."" is a refreshing change of pace from the usual, long winded, dry books on Roman history. It is a concise, clear, chronologically presented work, but still manages to be quite thorough in examining a variety of the causes behind the rise and fall of the Romans. The author touches on the social, military, economic and moral factors that made the Romans great, and in the end led to collapse of their empire. I can recommend it as a worthwhile read to those of you interested in the history of the Romans."
4,"Excellent, just wish it was longer","This book was very good, but I'd have liked a little more detail about the territories, schedule as world champ, the death of the NWA, etc."
5,a rare great read,"Right up there with Foley's first book, Terry Funk's autobiography is respectful, honest, and straightforward. Great anecdotes, along with some genuinely reasoned essays on what has gone both right and wrong with wrestling over the years. A must-read for any wrestling fan."
4,Told a the Funker would say it,I have read many wrestling books and this book is by far one of the best. You can tell that Terry had his hand in it just by the wording. Great insight to a wonderful journey of his life in wrestling.
2,Not as indepth as would have liked,"I grew up a fan of Terry, Dory Jr and Dory Sr. I was familiar with all the wrestlers he profiled in his book - but I felt as though the book was written very quickly and almost stream of conscious. He would start telling one story and then rush off to the next. I wanted more details, I suppose. He certainly comes off as likeable and funny. The book was fun, but I wanted a whole lot more from my childhood hero."
4,very informative,A great book for deck building. My only complaint is there was a bit too much info on the exotic style decks that can be built. More regular first time info would have been helpful. Overall though a great book for the price.
3,Still looking,"This book was ok, but I was still left longing for something more comprehensive, with more examples and more pictures."
2,<sigh!>,"This is nothing more than a bad imitation of Theatre of Tragedy (TOT). The interplay of light and shade in both song and music that characterise TOT becomes rather flat in this bombastic creation as TSOTB overdo both the vocal and instrumental part. In creating a gothic work of art with all its gloom, sorrow and trepidation it is not enough to have a female singer with an angel's voice, a growling male singer (who has got a cold) and a whining violin hoping that you don't need any talent or artistic skill.If you like mainstream goth music TSOTB is probably excellent, but if you truly want something dark filled with sorrow this CD is a bad choice."
5,This album could destroy the Berlin Wall.,"Another great piece of work from a living legend. I particularly like ""Hot Shot City"" although all of the tunes from this album and ""the very best of"" are fantastic. Lets hope his battles with Karr won't affect his music composition! Also, when are people going to start giving this musical genius more credit for freeing east Germany?! It is a disgrace."
2,Don't bother,"First, what the hell is up with evil romance? Evil romance is one of the silliest concepts ever.Anyway, the music on this album is forgettable. Basically, I have forgotten how it sounded since I didn't like it much, and listened to it very few times."
4,Depressing as hell but beautiful.,"Im yet to hear Napalm Records release a bad artist (tristania,Sirenia,Summoning,)and they still havent.The Sins of thy beloved belong up amongst the highest ranks of Gothic metal way above Mediocre bands such as lacuna coil who frankly dont have half the creativity or talent as TSOTB.This album is not recommended to anyone that is mentally unstable or has low self esteem,Its very very depressing.But for those of us that can handle it its absolutely beautiful.TSOTB are one of those few bands that dont just make music,they make feelings.Its the perfect soundtrack to a failed love story.Musicain wise its famtastic as well The keyboards are used to great affect and the violins by pete johansen (also helped out tristania and sirenia)are incredible.All alone being my personal Favourite with the Mid song sample followed by the gorgeous Violin part working to great affect.One of the best Goth Metal releases in a long time."
5,Oh GOD Yes!,"Bands like Evanescence should open their ears and realize what they *could* be. This is near perfect neo-classical gothic metal with male screaming/anguished vocals and female siren like singing with (once again) sweet electric violining! Get it, and get something by Theatre of Tragedy or Tristania if you like this."
5,Nikon Action Extreme 10x50,"Excellent product. If you are a hunter/outdoorsman on a budget and dont want to mortgage a home for bino's, these are the ones to own. Great clarity, very durable and bright light gathering. Nikon has the best value in this price category."
4,nikon 7245,excellent product I am very satisfied most powerful would have been too heavyItem being reviewedNikon 7245 Action Ex Extreme 10 X 50 mm All Terrain BinocularsNikon 7245 Action Ex Extreme 10 X 50 mm All Terrain Binoculars
4,Good binoculars,"This is a very nice built pair of binoculars, good optics. Not too big, not too heavy. The only problem I have with it is that its rubber really smells bad. When you hold the binoculars to your eyes, your nose would suck in all the bad rubber smell. The way the object lens covers are attached to the strap is not good. The covers would easily come of the strap. I would like if they are attached to a different string."
3,Nikon 7245,"I am extremely disappointed in the weight of the binoculars - it's probably my fault because I didn't look for the weight when I bought it. I took it on a cruise to Alaska, and it was by far the heaviest thing in my carry-on, and it's even feels heavy for viewing. As for usability, it was a little hard to get perfect focus. Perhaps it's harder for me because I have had cataract surgery, and the lens in one eye is for close-up work and the other for distance. But that shouldn't be an issue with general Nikon quality.This is the first time I've really been disappointed with something I've bought from Amazon."
5,Can't wait,"for good weather to get out there. Applied strap without any difficulty. Still working on adjustments, but I think I have it where it should be. Crisp images. I bought this item for star gazing, and bird watching. I did look at some stars one night, a few nights ago, but I got so cold, all it looked like was shooting stars. Shivering was a problem."
4,Nikon 10 x 50,"Bought this as an upgrade to a Bushnell binocular I have. This is a lot more powerful, image is ultra clear and right in your face, the view so detail and color true. I am totally satisfied with it. Makes nature watching a pleasure"
3,Bigger not always better,"I bought a set of the Nikon 8x40 Action Ex for my girlfriend and I liked them so much I decided to get a pair for myself. Not wanting to get the exact same ones she had, I decided to 'upgrade' to the 10x50. The 10x50 are about 200g heavier and significantly larger as well. Overall I found that they were too hard to stabilize, and the focus mechanism too slow with too much resistance. In the end, the extra magnification provided little advantage as the image was not any clearer than the 8x40, and the image was much less stable.In the end, I returned the 10x50 for another pair of the 8x40 Action Ex and I couldn't be happier."
2,waste of time and money,"Neither synopsis nor background material are provided. The music, staging and performances are attractive. The opera is apparently about complex interpersonal relationships. Since I could hardly understand a word of what was sung, even though it was in English, throughout the opera I didn't know what was going on! Had there been subtitles I would have been able to decide wheither the action is really relevant or is much to do about nothing. Operas in English need subtitles in English!"
4,Great product...and good customer service...,"(This review was written by my wife)First, I love the Biolage gelee products and use them daily. As I am on an extended stay out of the U.S. currently, I ordered this shipped to a friend who was coming for a visit to bring to me, so the shipping time was important. I ordered two bottles. As it turned out, the supplier only had one bottle in stock. To their credit, they went ahead and shipped one bottle of the gelee, and to compensate for the later shipment of the second bottle, included a gift of a Biloge hairspray. I thought that was very sweet of them. They included a note on the shipping slip that the second bottle would be shipped soon. I appreciate their consideration and will likely do business with them again if the future."
3,Moiseyev Dance Company: A Gala Evening,"Being the only one of it's kind available in the past, it is very enjoyable. However, the newer one (1991), Russian Seasons, a Mantovani & Fleishaker production, is much more professional and very enjoyable, other than a couple of very slow numbers that, in my opinion, should have been left out. The number done on skis is awesome. These former soloists of the Moiseyev company continually amaze you with doing that which is seemingly physically impossible. Years ago, in live performance, I saw a Russian dance troupe named Frula, and have never forgotten it. Would love to see them on video.Sue Hallstrom"
4,Canine Rescue,"Because of its length, you pretty much have to be a serious dog lover to stick with and appreciate this series, which recounts multiple episodes of rescue, rehabilitation and retraining of neglected, wounded or misbehaving canines of all shapes, sizes and ages. Most of these doggies are pretty cute and appealing. The caregivers, themselves, are an attractive and idealistic bunch who are clearly making major contributions to animal (and by extension human) welfare. The Michael Vick saga plays a role in all of this and adds to the up-to-date feel of the film."
3,Not bad.,"Provided some needed insight into my own effort to go electric. Much of it is well written and easy enough to understand. Some of it was way over my head technically, but still enough down to earth stuff to be helpful. Does spend a bit too much time on AC motors, which are not yet practical for battery powered craft, and he missed completely the permenant magnet motors such as Etek, PMG and LEMCO. Still there is a lack of published information in this area, and he does make a definate start."
3,Good read,"Not a bad read for getting your feet wet on making an EV for water. It covers hulls, batteries, speed controlling and motors. Along the way is a few efficiency graphs from various builds."
2,Missing the middle,"In the first couple of hours (the first CD) this was a great program for getting started in studying French. Unfortunately the first CD stopped well short of the second. The second CD takes a very large leap forward leaving you wondering if you missed some second level on CD 1. You will however be able to recognize enough words to be able to guess correctly on most of the questions on CD 2, but being able to pick the correct picture by picking the work for ""boat"" out of a spoken sentence is not in my opinion learning French. The first CD on this was good enough that I'll plunk down the money and try the 7 CD Pro version. Give me a month (End of March 2002) and I'll try to let you know how that program does as well as French for Dummies. Until then don't bother with this version."
1,Dislike Instant Immersion,I was very disappointed with this program. It is not easy to use and there are very little instructions. It also was very boring. I ended up taking it back for a refund.
2,Needs an editor,"Have just finished reading this book. Dosen't anyone use an editor these days?? She spends a hundred pages telling us about overcoming her resistance to writing the book!! More detail, less speculation and family conversations would have made for a less labourious read. Does not really add a lot to information about Atlantis. A lot of extraneous material to wade through before finding a few gems.The Cayce material is more worthwhile. I hope she finally managed to lose weight though and Archangels Michael and Gabriel kept their part of the bargain."
1,Nonsense,"Like Graham Hancock's books, this is a load of nonsense. Any books whose titles include any of the words 'quest', 'sphinx', 'Holy Grail', 'Ark of the Covenant', 'ancient', 'mysterious', 'secrets', 'Atlantis', 'Templar', 'alien', 'code', 'supernatural', 'mythic', 'cosmic', are just giving away the fact that they are unscientific rubbish. And isn't it significant that the leading Nazi Heinrich Himmler had a passionate interest in the 'Ark of the Covenant' and the occult? All these books are based on wishes and dreams, but we should all know that children wish, adults decide. Adults who waste any of their time on this sort of nonsense are regressing to a childish time. Adults should not do this. These books are all regressive, reactionary."
4,Mother's Day Gift,"I bought this for my Mom for a Mother's Day gift, she loved it and said it works great."
1,Ipod shuffle,"I hate to admit, but I have bought at least five of these, all only lasting a month or less. They are a great idea, but don't hold up if you are going to use for exercising and/or plan on sweating."
5,Great for Running/Jogging,My teenagers are both avid runners. They both already had bigger iPods but wanted something smaller and more convenient for running. They specifically requested the iPod Shuffle for Christmas because of it's size and the built-in clip. They both really like the iPod Shuffle and use it everytime they run.
4,Great For A Workout,"This works fine only if you don't care what song is coming next. That is the only thing that I can't stand, but that is a nit picky thing. This is great for children and people that don't want the complicated bigger mp3 players. All and All this is all I need for me."
1,Craptastic!,Bought this for a friend only to find out in months time the batterydoesn't charge right!When I informed Amazon and the seller who sold it to me they refused to do anything about it.They suck don't trust them and get stuck with a malfunctioning I-pod.
5,Apple iPod shuffle 1 GB Blue (2nd Generation) OLD MODEL,great little player songs to save anywhere and very good sound quality. I was satisfied with the purchase of the ipod
5,Great for the gym.,This is my first Ipod and it's better than I expected. The sound is very cd like. You can play the songs as you arrange them with the I tunes software or use the shuffle feature to mix up your playlist. The player is very portable and is great for use at the gym.
4,Mostly better than civ 2,"Better interface and graphics, lots of cool new units and a more realistic flow of history. The game is a bit easier though, so if you're an expert type player you may want to think twice. Also, the 48 Meg RAM minimum is a laugh."
3,"Such a wonderful game, such a horrible design","There's so much to love here, you almost fogive it. Almost.This is the best-ever Civ game (assuming you prefer Earth history to space-future; if not, see Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri); it truly is. At least from the stand point of what it tries to do. If you have a G4 tower and abt 256MB of RAM, you'll just adore it. You won't be able to get enough.Unfortunately, most of us don't. I tried to play this on a 233MHz iMac. Oh Gosh! 48MB of RAM ""recommended""? Hello! It ran, all right -- with 150MB of virtual memory (and in case you've never tried it, the trade-off in processor speed for running all that VM just ain't worth it). You might as well try to run Windows 2000 on a 286, or Mac OS 9 on a Macintosh Plus (if that were possible).Again, if you have the processor, go for it: this is truly wonderful. But if you don't, just forget about it. All you'll do is kick the box it came in."
2,It's not Civ II,"As a HUGE fan of Civ II (I've spent more time with that game than I spent in High School), I was pretty excited when this came out. Sure, it looked different, but it had lots of really cool additions. Now, a week has passed, and I must say that this game kinda sucks. It lacks the primary component that Civ II has. PLAYABILITY. It's so freaking slow as far as game play goes, and the battle scences are simply horrid. Civ was like a nice little chess game on the nth scale. This is Might & Magic with four billion rules. There's a difference. Wait for Alpha Centauri. Sid Meyer actually had a part in that."
5,"OOO, AHHH, WOW!","I've read the customer reviews of this game, and maybe they have a point about needing a good processor, but with the computer we have, the game is absolutely awesome. It takes Civ games to a new level. This is an extremely time consuming game, so if you don't have a lot of extra time, don't play it. If you don't have a lot to do, though, the game is simply wonderful. It allows you to colonize space, create water cities, and create many new things previously unallowed by civ. games. Of the civ games I have so far, this is absolutely the best!!!!"
2,Nice attempt but misses the mark,"Civilization Call to Power has some nice new features that add to the Civilization series. However the documentation is poor and it strays from the series typical pieces. Its interface is nice in regards to grouping but it is too easy to send pieces off in the wrong direction. It is also ackward to view the protecting pieces for a given city without activating them. Once activated it takes two turns to fortify them again. The civilization advances, playing pieces are completely different and do not seem to be well thought out for game play. I have not completely given up on this one, but I am close. One very frustrating thing is that you must have the CD mounted in the computer for play! Save your money and give this one a pass."
2,didn't like it as much as Civilization,Sometimes a game is good and doesn't need major rehauls -- Civilization is one of these and its updates and upgrades play on the original strengths of the game. I find that Call to Power is unnecessarily complicated and I really dislike the graphics -- they seem slow and kind of weird. As much as I realize that lawyers can affect things I find have legal units silly. Just give me the upgraded original and I'll be thrilled.
2,A game that is less than the sum of its parts,"This version of Civ is a poor attempt to update those great earlier games, Civ and Civ 2. While GT took a lot of thought about what might be neat to add to the game, they put little thought into how these additions would affect game play and balance. I found the game interface difficult, the new additions unbalancing, and the entire game to be a frustrating experience. I give them an extra star for creativity, but while some parts are nice, this game is a failure on the whole."
4,This book is very appropriate for young readers.,"I enjoy this book very much. The characters are human-like in nature which gives the book charm. Lionni captures the essence of siblings in the cute frog characters. The moral is easy to understand and something to remember for all ages, not just children. A definate must have."
1,very dissappointed,"very sad still haven't received book I order for my classroom, my pre-schoolers are still waiting for this book I promise them!!!!!!!!"
5,Great,"This book is key to understanding Spanish as a second language. While other instruction texts only gloss over the linguistic aspects of the language, having an understanding of these tools will make learning Spanish much easier for a serious student already well into their Spanish studies."
2,Not what I expected,"The item description promised me minimal highlighting and only a few marks in pen, and noted that it was the best in stock. I shelled out the extra money because I wanted a cleaner copy of this book. When I received it, the cover was damaged and the book has 4 different kinds of highlighting that have every page COVERED. Wish I'd known there was this much visible wear and tear to the book so I could have gotten a different copy."
5,Great for hard to heal skin cuts and road rash,"All I have to do is scrape some skin off and it will get infected fast. This product is great. You cover your booboo with this ""fake skin"" and let it heal. If the wound puts out fluid, take off the skin, wash it off and put on another skin bandage. I get the large ones and just cut off what I need. It can be tricky to get the backing off this way so be sure to include the backing flap in your bandage. Great for burns too, no scars. It was originally recommended to me by my doctor, to help heal a sore on my foot and avoid skin grafting."
3,D-Link DSM-320RD,"The unit sounds better than it is. I have it connected wirelessly, it may work better connected hardwire. Set-up was relatively easy, it found my media server, but any server interruptions require me to go back and search for the server again - not as user friendly as I hoped. My biggest complaint is the operation of the remote. I am not sure if the remote signal is weak, or if the unit needs to ""think"" between buttons. Either way, it is frustrating to point the remote pushing buttons with nothing happening."
2,Room for improvement - Infact go back the drawing board.,I bought this device in the hope that I wouldn't have to spend the money on the Apple equivalent. (now i'm saving up for one) Unfortunately the DSM 320RD leaves a lot to be desired. It has definite issues with playback and the picture quality is horrible. When watching DVD's or video files you will get frequent white flashes on the screen. Sometimes the video file ends early. And the worst thing to have happen is when playing a DVD sometimes the unit would spontaneously shut itself off. It has no memory function to remember where you leave off and it is difficult if not possible to fast forward or rewind in video files.Set up of the unit was easy but this is no comfort for lack usability. Save your money to get a unit that has a better design. Do the research. I wish I did.
3,"Good potential, but poor design...","This could've been a great product, if it actually worked as advertised. First of all, the setup was a nightmare. And it's coming from me, someone with over 10 years of experience in IT. I spent a few hours on the phone with D-Link Support, and they weren't very helpful. I ended up resolving problem(s) myself after hours of online research. I finally got the damn thing to work, but it's behaving very flaky at times. I have to reboot my computer several times before it finally recognizes the server (software); sometimes I loose wireless signal all of a sudden. The hardware part seems to be working fine, it's mostly the software (firmware) that I blame. Like I said before, it's got a lot of nice features, but lacks performance. Hopefully, D-Link will release some updates shortly, otherwise, I suggest you think twice before purchasing this player."
4,Seventeen Style Studio,"I bought this for my 9 year old and she was able to use it without any difficulties. Very easy to use. The only complaint I have is that we kept having to load her original picture into the program every time she wanted to do a new style on her face, which is not hard to do, but it gets annoying. There was no way to save the original picture in the program. Other than that, it is a great. User friendly, and a lot of fun. Highly recommend."
2,You can't learn to speak a language with nothing but nouns.,"I bought this software thinking it would teach me Spanish.When I got home and loaded the software I found the games were fun. It made learning a huge list of vocabulary as painless as possible. The problem I have with this software is you can't speak a language with just nouns and colors. It doesn't teach you any verbs, or grammer. The 2nd CD is all in Spanish. There is no way to progress form the 1st CD to the 2nd CD. A beginner can not learn to speak or understand using this software no matter how dedicated they are or how well they learn the 1st CD. If you want a list of vocabulary words then this is your CD. If you want to learn to understand and speak Spanish this is NOT the software for you.I wish I could get my money back."
1,Nothing like what I thought it would be,"This product, oddly enough, is better suited for someone that speaks Spanish and wants to learn English. The talking dictionary is especially poor. Don't make the same mistake I did in thinking that the dictionary would 'read' (meaning speak) words written in English in Spanish, e.g. it doesn't speak spanish. What the dictionary does is allows you to highlight words written in English which it will then 'speak' the english pronunciation and give you lists of spanish words that may be appropriate."
4,Great for the beginner,"I knew very, very little Spanish when I purchased this CD set. The set emphasizes a basic vocabulary and has given me a start to learning this language. The major emphasis is given to vocabulary but I now know the basics and am learning grammer from another program. The second CD is a little confusing at first (it's all in Spanish) but I was impressed by how much I had learned from the first CD and I am working my way through the second. This would be great for teaching children a basic Spanish vocabulary."
2,Disappointed,I should have read Jason's review before buying this. CD 1 was ok; I can say 'Telephone' '17' 'brown' in Spanish. But CD 2 is... I don't understand ANYTHING. I'm returning this to the manufacturer - they offer a 100% satisfaction guarantee.
2,a decent set for the price,"This 2 CD-ROM set is not a bad deal for the price. The first disc teaches some nouns and has some fun games. The second is nothing but games. The main problem with this set is that the second disc is all in Spanish and the first disc does not teach enough to prepare one for the second disc. The first disc teaches nouns only and no verbs, adjectives, etc. Since it is fairly cheap, it is worth buying to go along with something else but just don't buy this expecting to learn a whole lot from it alone."
2,Only very basic instruction.,"This Spanish Language CD set is really very basic. It only teaches you words for things, and it never really explains itself very well. If you are looking to learn Spanish from scratch, this CD will not help very much.My mother was born in Panama. She is a native Spanish-speaker, and she is helping me to learn my Spanish now, and she has taught me alot of it. She explained to me that this CD teaches has a few mistakes in it, and furthermore, does not distinguish between the more proper forms of Spanish (like that spoken in Spain and Argentina).This CD does have some educational value to it, but it is only rudimentary. I would suggest (if at all possible) having a native Spanish-speaker around to point you in the right direction. If not, then you can still learn some things from it, but it won't help that much."
4,Must have for beginner or returning Spanish students,"If you have just started or are into your first year of Spanish, or, if you took a few years of Spanish long ago and want a refresher, this CD set is a must have -- and a huge bargain. The two CDs offer a lot of *fun* as well as a *lot* of quality exercises -- it will take you many, many hours to get through them all, and I found myself doing most of them a second or even third time. These CDs will help a lot in reinforcing the basic Spanish vocabulary you are learning in class (or used to know). There is no verb work. Works on both PC and Mac (I'm on a Mac, running system 9.x -- no problem)."
5,Great Classic Hits,I love the Gatlins and this CD has all the hits that I love to listen to. Anyone who loves the Gatlins will love this CD too!
1,Very poor editing. Poor pagination of figures and text.,"The LANE chapter has numerous errors including a few that totally confuse a reader. In one place the author means multiple Lan Emulation Clients (LECs), but it is presented as ""LECS"". In figure 9-1, the LEC is labelled LECS, and the text has the LEC registering with the LECS! (Matches diagram, but it should be with the LES).Wait for the next edition."
4,Almost great,"Well first off this is a great buy for the price (I got a refurbished one.) But with a low price comes some drawbacks. First of all the manual. Like the other reviewers said, you have to print it out. No thanks. It is easy to learn though so that's not that big of a deal.If you have Win 98 you will more than likely have problems connecting it to your USB. It can be done, but it's a bigger process than the manual states. There are drivers not on the CD-Rom that you need for installation. Their in you computer, but finding them is tricky.The pictures are great though. Even at the lowest resolution they are incredible. The highest? WOW!! what detail. The included software is great for beginners. If you have Photoshop or the like however, use those instead.The autofocus is a bit slow. I would've liked a manual option but oh well.All in all, for a 3.3 Megapixel [at this price]. This is a good deal. I recommend it to any newbies to digital photograpy."
1,huge disappointment,"I recommend the far less expensive book Essence of Seashore: Beautiful Inspirations for the Home by Andrea Spencer. For $10 and change it beats this volume by all standards.Though the photographs by Brooke are passable, the pretensions and fawning comments by and about the wealthy Seaside homeowners were hard to take. The photos and text give anyone seeking interior design insights little or nothing.The only purchasers for this waste of time are the owners so they can impress their family and acquaintances. Unfortuinately the author has them coming across as such an elitist bunch with unmet needs. It is hard to understand why this wasn't released by a vanity press publisher instead of a reputable firm like Rizzoli."
5,necessary for a solid understanding,this book gives a structural engineer the best overview for the fundamentals of structural analysis. it is written like a professor would have taught a class - very clear explanations and very representative examples. i highly recommend this book for anyone wanting to get a solid understanding and not try to shortcut his or her way and get confused later.
3,"I've had worse, but there must be better somewhere","Well frankly I didn't much care for this text. I found the examples to be both sparse and lacking. I was particularly disappointed with the section on wind loading and the section covering the various methods for analyzing indeterminate frames. Both of which I found to be insufficient and confusing. If you are assigned this text, then, I suggest that you either acquire solutions for the unassigned problems (to use as examples) or try to find a supplemental text. On the other hand, this text offers plenty of challenging problems for you to work. If you have already taken the class and know the subject, but wish to hone your engineering skills, then this is a good book to practice with."
3,It's a text book,"This book is no better or worse than your average textbook. Currently taking a class under one of the proffessors who wrote this,Uang, I find he is better teaching it in class than his book (this book) is at trying to explain it. The book is mostly easy to follow, usually has a good number of examples, but does assume a certain level of pre-exsisting knowledge."
1,Not good with G5 Mac,"Before buying any WD Raptor high performance hard drives for use in a Mac G5... search the WD website until you find the tech support article that says some are not compatible. I thought we were all past this sort of stupid problem, but apparently not. WD apparently held back on publicly admitting this for way too long.The Raptor is ""enterprise class"" and marketed as being built for heavy usage. And it does SEEM to work ok in a Mac dual G5 tower. But under heavy usage it locks up the OS really badly. (Like every other week, but sometimes goes 80 days). This cost us untold grief & thousands of dollars before figuring it out 13 months later. Adding a PCI SATA card fixed the problem. WD blames Apple, but Apple says they are at SATA spec. Whatever, it was a horrible combo until we added the basic (bootable) Sonnet pci sata card to drive the WD Raptor drives. Do your homework & beware."
1,"The Title Should be ""50 Hikes NOT in Northern Virginia""","I almost bought this book, until I realized not a single hike described is actually in Northern Virginia, where I live. All the hikes are in Virginia, but ""Northern Virginia"" generally refers to the areas areound Washington, DC, say as far south as Stafford and as far west as Leesburg. These hikes are in Shennandoah National Park, western VA, and the Chesapeake Bay areas."
2,"Premise is good, writing not so much","The previous two reviews I don't think really touch upon the book itself, but are more of a personal opinion in regard to the ""pink ribbon phenomenon"" in general.While I think the author of the book had some important things to say and did her research, the writing really leaves something to be desired. Many of the pages could have been omitted as King tends to refer back to previous chapters and outlines what is to come far too much. I really felt as if I was reading the same thing over and over just so that the author could fill a few more pages.The message itself is a good one, but it could have been written in a much more reader-friendly manner. A 30-page introduction by the author and another 30 pages of notes at the end, let you know it is going to be a wordy one."
2,Blah..,"Just used it on my boat...i think soap and water would clean better. I do like the Aerospace Protectant by 303 though. I applied that after the cleaner and it left the vinyl looking really clean, it totally beads the water and you can feel the coating making the vinyl more durable. Streaks a little if you don't wipe it all up. For the money, the cleaner didn't live up to my expectations."
2,Didn't get the Mildew off Sunbrella fabric cushion covers,Bought this to get the mildew/mold off some outdoor dining seat cushions and it didn't help. I tried spraying directly on the seat cushions and also mixing with bleach (as the directions indicate) and still - no use. Back to the drawing board for these cusion covers!
5,Live and die by Ruthless Juveniles,"My friends and I lived by Ruthless in the winter of 1992, that being the time of release of their first album, Hard as theF**k...their music is different from any other I've ever heard. They are from New Orleans without the tacky Mardi Gras [stuff.] It is really hardcore gangster lyrics, but the music is UNBEATABLE. I've bought every other CD out of the MOBO house, and usually they may have one song on them that resembles this disc, but that's it. Ruthless Juveniles' subsequent releases couldn't even touch the splendor of their original release. I was happy to see that this greatest hits disc contains most of the original disc, since Hard as the F**k is IMPOSSIBLE to find. (Really, try it). This is a must have for rap fans--not even a hint of pop."
3,Very good but not the best,There are several versions of Trial By Jury. This is a modern dress verion that is well sung and staged. It is not the best but certainly enjoyable. I have not watch the HMS Pinfore.
4,I loved this version,"I really liked this version. The captain is brilliant, Buttercup is delicious, the sisters, cousins, and aunts are delightful. The crew is great. Deadeye Dick could be sleazier and uglier though. Here and there an Australian accent comes through and the crew's hats are worn at an odd angle but this doesn't detract at all. One crewman has the forward brim pulled down like a bush hat.But it, buy it. Terrific rendition."
5,Excellent Gilbert and Sullivan Production,I love G&S; and this production is top notch.Reccomended to anyone who likes G
5,Two Excellent Performances,"Like many others, I purchased the set to get a DVD version of Trial by Jury. The surprise wasn't the wonderful quality of ""Trial"", but that ""Pinafore"" was so well done. Even some Savoyards seem to think that great voices are not required in G&S; performances - or even appreciated, but I doubt Sullivan had the voices of high school juniors or semi talented amateurs in mind when he wrote the music.When the Jury Foreman has a better voice then the leads in most productions, you know you are on to something very special."
2,What did they say?,I'll probably have to watch this production several times or get the script off of the Internet because the casts' lines are difficult to understand. Subtitles would have been helpful.
4,Interesting interpretations,"I would love a traditional version of ""H.M.S. Pinafore"" and ""Trial By Jury,"" but I also love seeing different interpretations that bring fresh life to these old favorites. That's what we have here. I have never seen Little Buttercup so bawdy before and at first I thought ""What on earth is going on?"" Then I caught the joke and found this new interpretation of her as delightful. Of course she should be a little bawdy... she is, after all, a criminal for mixing up those babies, and she is, after all, on board a ship at night long after she should have gone home.Seeing ""Trial By Jury"" presented as a modern day Celebrity Scandal Trial was also a brilliant bit of business. All of the old Gilbert bits were in there, plus some new ones that might be fresh out of any modern tabloid."
4,All but one!,"Trial By Jury....very innovative and enjoyable.As for Pinafore, wonderful production, well sung, well staged, well everything, but... but what on earth were they thinking when they cast Little Buttercup? It was like Patti Lupone sings Tosca. Bleh! Otherwise, it's worth it. Would nevertheless recommend."
3,Avatars and Darkness,"This book is a beautifully written story. The language is moderately advanced and the plot itself is very descriptive. There is no trouble picturing the scenes as they occur. However, with the pros comes the cons. Unlike the previous two novels in the trilogy, this one does not really give many of the characters any in depth feelings, with the exceptions of Phedre and her paramour, Joscelin. Sadly, the plot, while being descriptive, turns rambling in many areas that draw out the story painfully. Personally, I expected to see more character finalization in the last novel, particularly of some of the other key characters, and the development of new characters falls short of making the people believable and intriguing. The book itself is a good read if you are going pure leisure, but I do not recommend buying it in hard cover. It simply is not worth the expense."
2,Purple prose does not make for good writing,"Perhaps this book, and the horrible predecessor KUSHIEL'S CHOSEN, would not have been so disappointing if the first one wasn't so unusual. The purple prose and self-aggrandizing style of narration set my teeth on edge, but I read and enjoyed DART because it was different. This book, however, shows that you can drag something out too long when it is built around a single, exploitative gimmick.I pray now that this truly is the end of this series, and that Ms. Carey will extend her talents elsewhere."
1,Ran out of steam,"At least its over. Gotta admire that. If the story aint epic, it shouldnt go on forever. This series started ot run out of steam in the second book. Its done, it was ok overall, but would have made a better stand alone book. The bright spot is that Carey says thats what shes doing next. Ill believe it when I see it."
2,So disappointed,"I loved Kushiel's Dart. I liked Kushiel's Chosen, though I admit I think the characters I had been so intrigued with in the first book had lost a lot of their edge. Now it is gone completely. Kushiel's Avatar still has some of the grit left, but on the whole I have to admit it took me a very long time to finish this book I had anticipated so much. I read Dart in a single sitting, avoiding sleep and even sit-down meals. This was a struggle to finish. The plot is average, not what I have come to expect of Carey. I guess this is an interesting analogy to the passion and hard core sex that has been Ms. Carey's stock in trade. Even the hottest of fires cools to ash. Sometimes I guess it flares out quickly. I am glad to see this story is finally over. I will probably read Elegy for Darkness, just to see if she can rejuvenate my interest, but I will not preorder it, nor will I buy it in hardcover. I recommend this policy to others as well."
5,Great ending.,I great ending to one of my favorite trilogies. The story telling was top shelf material with deep and interesting characters.
5,Great tale to get lost in!,"The continuance of Phedre's story holds twist after twist. A rich and intricate background of characters and scenery. Also, a few points to ponder."
3,lots of un-popped kernels,"I like the flavor and the fact that the corn is non-GMO, but I do not like to toss a handful of unpopped kernels."
3,Eurocentric Rubbish,"Watson utterly ignores the impact of Egypt on classical Greece and only mentions Sub-Saharan Africa to speak of the so-called inferiority of its mathematics. He also ignores many ongoing historical controversies such as whether or not writing developed in Mesopotamia originally. While the book is supremely interesting for what it does offer it is a disturbing example of Eurocentrism because of what it lacks. In offering the illusion of comprehensibility concerning the creation of the global mind, I fear this book will accomplish little more than to add to the class of narrow-minded, pseudo-intellectual, self-inflated occidentalists."
5,"Want new, better designs, increased confidence & success?","Spinnerbaits, buzzbaits and jigs all belong to the same family. The bass jig itself is a basic tool that works ""on the drop"" and then on the bottom. The spinnerbait is a specialized form of the bass jig that works well in mid-water applications from slow-rolling just above bottom to bulging or waking just below the surface - and every depth in between. The buzzbait is a specialized form of bass jig that works best as a topwater surface commotion lure. With just these three lures, an angler - you - can face and be successful in any bass angling situation. Long term, it is in the best interest of your bass fishing success to study this book. Even if you do not intend to make them yourself, you will benefit from studying all the many factors and variations in the basic anatomy of these fish-catching creations.And if you do intend to make them yourself, as I do, then you've got everything you need to know in this book."
2,Not impressed,"I should have paid more attention to the other reviews because they are pretty accurate. The directions are poorly written and the file tool is not easy to figure out. There's no label of what each item is in the kit. The directions refer to things that aren't in the kit. The file tool does seem to work OK. There's enough wax for one tuning and then you'll need to buy more. The file brush is cheap. The kit does not include a diamond stone which is really nice to have. Overall, I'm nott impressed with this kit and wish I had built my own kit by buying each needed item individually."
2,nearly junk kit,"At a first look when it arrived it was not bad impressive with nice box and bag. However, couple of weeks later when I opened it and want to use it, I found not all items are the same as I reviewed on Amazon, NYLON Bristle Brush and stone not included and the size of waxes smaller. Even worse, there was nowhere telling you what is what and what were included. you have to guess this was scraper, that was file... there were two pieces of paper labeled as instructions one for tuning and the other likely for waxing, but I don't know how many people could follow it to finish the job. if you are smart enough and able to follow it to do as it described then you may have to buy another half kit of items. A few items described in the instruction not included.strongly not recommend to buy it"
3,Meh despite the flying,"Jack is always competing with Wilson and he always loses. When he finds a book called ""lessons on flying"", he gives it a try.It's an okay story, but despite the flying it's neither captivating nor exciting."
4,Not Scary but so Great,"Jack Johnson hates contest. It's too bad he's always entering them. It's all because of Wilson. Wilson loves to turn everything into a contest. Especially in front of Mia, Jacks crush. The one day jack finds a book called Flying Lesson.The Book tells who humans can learn to fly. Jack does the book says and soon he's flying. It's really neat at first. Until Wilson gets a hold of the book. Now Wilson can fly too. Soon word of there new ability's get out to the public. Now the press won't leave Jack alone. Will Jack's life ever be normal again?Sometimes RL Stine didn't try to scare his readers, sometimes all he wanted to put forth was a mild fantasy. This is surely the best ""non-scary"" Goosebumps book, with a genuinely weird concept and easily the sweetest twist ending in the seriesI give it 4 Stars"
3,SO COOOOLLL But not scary at all,THis book is about a kid who learns how to fly. THe part about the kid flying for the first time is the best part. But there are no scary parts.:( But I recamond this book to a person who has never read a Goosebumps book before.
5,The End of the Story Arc,"This is the third volume of Queen Seondeok, a really long K-drama. Volume 1 is the background, Volume 2 is the ascent of the hidden heir and building power to ascend the throne. In this volume, everything really starts to fall apart. Keeping control and staying true to one's ideals is very difficult. Old friends and companions end up in power and isolation, plotting against each other and making compromises that destroy their relationships. It all ends in an inevitable tragedy of blood and betrayal. Each character's original strengths, such as love, loyalty, persistence, devotion to duty, trust, etc. prove to be their weakness in the end. Lots of sad moments in this Volume. Every time it looks like something may be salvaged, fate intervenes. Minor characters assume pivotal roles as betrayal follows betrayal and characters manipulate and are manipulated further down the road to destruction."
1,Pitiful product,"This program is simply terrible. It is EXTREMELY hard to use. The hairstyles don't look like real colors, the masking process is really hard, and the only pros to this program are that you can see the names of the makeup, and you can use template models. If you want a true digital make-over this is NOT what you want."
1,Henry James collection,"in Portrait of a Lady the final two segments are missing from the set - nowhere to be found. I contacted Amazon by phone and was given a refund. The issue here, however, is that the producer of the set [BBC] sends an incomplete product, with no explanation. Who wants to see the beginning of Portrait of a Lady to be left suspended without an ending? Disgraceful."
3,Henry James Collection,"Some of this collection are of higher quality than others! I liked ""The American"" the best with ""The Spoils of Poynton"" being my least favorite. When they are ""old BBC productions"", I really miss the good lighting and musical scores that we enjoy now!"
2,Poorly put together,This collection is poorly put together with two discs pasted together instead of double sided ones for longer shows and carelessly packaged with scratches and other flaws.
3,Henry James collection,"This is atypical of many of these romantic dramas of this period, there was very little action, and to much dialologue, though there were many great actors involved, these type of dramas were much more like plays, whereas the Catherine Cookson Dramas, not only had great acting, but a lot of great action too."
3,Nice evening's entertainment,"Some stories are more memorable than others but the collection is worth seeing. The films were much less grandiose when these were created so the viewer must expect to view them as one would a play. The characters, in most cases, are complex and the stories are involved centering on in-depth dialogue between interesting characters, well-acted, in the complexities of human relationships. The subtitles are a necessity for many of the older generation and should be mandatory on all films sold in today's marketplace."
4,Worth the Price if Only for The Golden Bowl,"Everyone has a ""great author"" who they simply can't read. Mine is Henry James. Every attempt to read one of his novels has been a failure. With the single exception of ""The Heiress"", I've found every movie and stage adaptation of his works dreadful. Somehow, it seems that James was writing for the intimacy afforded by television, long before the medium existed. The gem in this collection is ""The Golden Bowl"". The movie version - with Uma Thurman and Nick Nolte - is a complete disaster, despite the sumptuous sets and star casting. The teleplay in this collection is exquisite - perfectly cast, perfectly scripted (especially the role of Bob Assingham, played by Cyril Cussack). Who cares if you can see the sets shake? The only real disappointment in this collection in ""The American"". It is particularly nice to find an adaptation of ""The Spoils of Poynton"", with a very young Gemma Jones."
5,The Wings of the Dove (solely),"""...Henry James' fiction represents a more vivid conception of the moral life than even Jane Austen or George Eliot."" (Harold Bloom)A moral dilemma delicately unfolded reaches a piercing pitch almost as it decays into a desolation which catches the dying echo of Merton Densher's ""Kate, take me now as I am"". There in the gorgeous final scene love is pitted against scruple or, as justly, love against love, one now fully lit, the other being extinguished as the couple see where they are. This dramatization is based on the middle novel of the last three masterpieces Henry James wrote in the vein of the ""melodrama of consciousness"". There are necessary compressions in an 81 minute rendering, but they are quibbles compared to the monstrosity of the 1997 release of the same name."
1,This version is NOT compatible with Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger,"This version is NOT compatible with Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger. The manufacturer says a new version may be available in 2006. Be aware: the box says it is compatible with 10.1 and 10.3, but doesn't say anything about 10.2 and 10.4. Of course I had to find this out after I received it since Amazon doesn't mention it."
1,Stay away from IBM Viavoice for Mac osx,"This program consistently fails to recognize even the slowest speech. I've trained it for three readings and it still makes a huge amount of errors. The errors don't even resemble a phonetic approximation, let alone what I dictated. Correction is user hostile. It doesn't seem to learn as I painfully try to correct the spellings. This voice recognition software isn't one tenth of Dragon Naturally Speaking for the PC."
4,Note on compatibility,"I used ViaVoice for about two years. It was spooky accurate at times. I found that if I read the training texts in my most normal voice (do not read slowly!), it worked very well. In fact, it seemed to be more accurate at faster speech speeds than in slower ones.Anyway, in regard to compatibility, I don't think the issue is the OS version as much as it is the processor type. When I bought my Mac Mini with the Intel processor it wasn't supported by ViaVoice. I had to keep my old computer to run it.One last thing, back up your training files. If there's a crash you won't have to retrain it."
2,Awkward,The onscreen text produced by ViaVoice requires more proofreading than the product's learning curve should allow.
3,not bad..,"I bought this as my first ""cd rom software"" to learn italian. I had started learning very basic italian through books.The first CD is interesting.. as it gives you a menu of different subjects.. and with each subject, you can learn some words. Then you are tested on these words.The second CD is ok, but i found that there was a whole step between CD 1 and CD 2. In CD 2, the host talks in italian and i could barely understand what she/he was saying. (i had to use a dictionnary for some parts)I give it only 3 stars because of that step and because of the limited number of words and sentences in both CD's.. i figure that more could have probably been on those CDs. It's a good start, but now i'm looking for a full program on CD rom."
1,Too basic...,Childish guessing games..no meat to this learning experience...do not recommend if you are anxious to learn the language...need more substance.
4,Good not so good,I really liked the interactive part of the cd. Makes you actually learn the words via recognition. I have not been able to find any other software that teaches this way. The draw back with this title is how few words are available... I have been searching for upgrades additional cds of words but... so far they dont exist.... great way to learn limited by what is available.
4,Great game but can be a little challanging,"This game is great! you get to go over music, geography and more! This game even features different troggles then ever. For example: Slimy replaces Zubb the grum from word munchers. The Pladipus replaces Spidy from the other Muncher games and so on. It's just so challanging! I justgot something to tell you. Don't compare Trivia Munchers To this game. Why? Cause it's the same game! (Knowledge munchers was formaly Trivia Munchers)Try it. You'll like it!"
5,Praise the God of all things new,"I really enjoy both of thier CD's. ALL THINGS NEW is worshipful in a more personal way. It is more mellow and is greatly instrumental. It still has the Watermark style of great vocals, clean,fresh instrumentals;and heartfelt praise to God,who makes all things new."
5,Angelic Voices,"I just got this album and it is incredible! ""More Than You'll Ever Know"" is a great song that makes me think of my best friends. ""All Things New"" is brilliant--both the sound and the words! Watermark's music is soothing, yet thought-provoking and worshipful. It's incredible! It's best listened to through headphones, so you can surround yourself with the awesome music and lyrics. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do!"
5,Love the Lyrics,"Incredible CD! The lyrics speak to the heart about character of God and the joy of knowing him. Definetely a ""must buy""!"
5,Some catchy tunes that are well done,"This duo, new two years ago, has a surprisingly good sound. She has a unique sound to her voice -- sort of country-like, sort of pop-like, sort of gospel-like. Both Christy and her husband are talented, but there's more there than just talent. Love for God is displayed through the lyrics of all of the songs. The bright, joyful sound of the more upbeat tracks, track #2 - More Than You'll Ever Know, a perfect example, are accompanied by well-written, well-meaning words. The slower songs, like ""Where to Find Me"" - track 4, are simple, but deep. I know I can't help singing along when I listen to my favorite songs on this disc. I highly recommend this CD to anyone."
1,Can't Take It Anymore,"My roomate has been playing this CD for 10 minutes, I just can't take it anymore. 2 words, this album stinks. Okay, that was three words, I normally do not lie, however this music is driving me to drink. I lie when I drink, just note that this review is the exception, it is the truth!"
1,A Gross Disappointment,"More than anything, one is most immediately struck by the sheer monotony of this album; how many times has this content (or its close variants) been spewed onto a recording and praised because it is a recapitulation of what was done well enough the first time around. The sole reason this recording has been so generously praised by the press and by fellow reviewers is due to a combination of sentimentality for historical greatness and a pathetic yearning to be presently associated with it.If you tend to agree with mainstream praise and have very little ability to dsisdtinguish, you'll love this.Happy listening!"
5,Great Nailer-Light-Dependable,"I bought this gun after I had a Senco framing nailer stolen out of my shop. I am a carpenter by trade and I have put this nailer to the test and it has never failed.It is lightweight which is a big plus for a nailer. It holds a good bit of nails, I can get three racks in at once which is very nice. I always oil my nailers each day before they are used and this seems to help them last and function correctly.It has a great feature that lets you select between shooting multiple nails without letting go of the trigger for very fast nailing (sometimes to fast, I have accidentally shot out two nails when I only meant to shoot one, its VERY fast). You can also select to shoot only one nail at a time which is good for precision work.I would buy this nailgun again no questions asked."
4,POWER !,"As a carpenter/contractor I get to use a many different kinds of tools each day. This gun unlike some I've used has the feel of power when you pull the trigger, as all Hitachi's do.It has worked superb never misses a shot,no jambs, and liteweight. The ONLY reason I gave it a 4 is that Hatachi should attach from factory a skyhook. Which I had to buy aftermarket. Buy the gun you won't be disappointed."
1,they break piston blades,"i am a profesional framer and these nailers repeatedly brake the piston blades in colder conditions. this has happened to me several times and a new paiston is 80 bucks plus the down time. Dont get me wrong when they work, they are awesome but i have switched to the nr83 model and they are by far the better gun and no problems. i have used just ablout every brand out there and they are the best."
5,Awesome gun,"I have used many different framing guns over the years and Hitachi leads the way hands down. My NR83A is still sinking nails at 20 years old. The NR90AE is a great step up, especially with the trigger switch. You don't get double nailing on those precarious nailing spots. Faster loading and better nail support in cold weather when collated nails break apart due to temp. Most of all, this gun sinks a nail every time as long as the compressor can keep up."
4,Excellent framing nailer,"I purchased this nailer for use in framing my basement, I just finished this project. No problems, the nailer is lightweight, the nails (also by Hitachi) are available in my local home center in several sizes, also galvanized. I had one jam (after going through ~1500 nails so far - it was my fault, I loaded a new strip of nail when a single nail from the previous strip was left in the nailer and shifted during loading. The plastic pieces of which hold together the nail strip fly all over the place while shooting, so safety glasses are essential. It needs oil (I put 10 drops in every day before use). Depth regulation is easy, but seldom needs adjustment. I do not particularly like the styling (but members of the generation that grew up on Transformers and such will probably like it). I prefer the more restrained and functional styling of the previous generation of Hitachi products (I have a stapler and a brad nailer)"
5,Somerville by NELSON DeMille,A mystery writer with wit. Reader stays interested and curious what will be around the next corner. Love conquers all.
2,Second rate reference book,"A rather toothless attempt at rewriting Strunk and White, or Chicago into ""fun."" Reference books shouldn't waste this much space on casual conversation. Get to the point--get Elements of Style, Elements of Grammar, and Chicago rather than this handbook."
2,Bad exercises,"The exercises in the book seem to be purposefully difficult. Is this to discourage prospective copyeditors or so that Einsohn can show off her years of experience? In order to be instructional, the explanations should fully cover the concepts that one will be tested on in the exercises. Anyone who can read should be able to read the text and then successfully complete the exercises. This is basic to good instructional design. Instead, in the exercises, Einsohn throws in the exceptions to the rules or tests on concepts only hinted at in the text. Einsohn reminds me of the bad teachers we have all experienced at one time or another who get satisfaction from confusing students by talking around a subject instead of teaching the subject directly. Success of students is not the goal of these teachers. There are many finer points in copyediting, but there are sets of rules governing them all. It should be a simple matter to present the rules and then test the student on those rules."
1,A clear waste of money.,"This was one of the most difficult books I have ever read. I wish I had not ordered it as it was not helpful to me. I would not recommend this book to anyone as the wording is very advanced and not for everyone. Extremely condescending! It's clearly not for a beginner or someone who is trying to start out in the business with little or no experience. I was hoping the book would help me with my career change, but it did nothing but throw my money away."
3,Useless without FinMetrics module,"This book is useless without the S+FinMetrics module.I wish I knew that in advance. Moreover, you can download it for free on www.insightful.com"
2,A low point in Eric's exploits,"Don't take the two star rating wrong, I number myself among Eric and Mac's greatest fans. I'm only comparing this book against the other works in the Matt Helm series. If I was comparing THE SHADOWERS to a Len Deighton or John Le Carre thriller it would get five stars; Berlin Game excluded, of course. THE SHADOWERS starts out great but stumbles to its knees and whimpers to an end. Even though I've read this book twice it left me nonplussed both times.For a truly great Helm book, try DEVASTATORS, INTERLOPERS or TERMINATORS instead."
2,Cheap and crap,I bought this mic at Walmart for minor voice work. I have to turn the gain to full and shout into the mic to get my PC to have a normal sounding recording. Pass this up and get something else if you're looking to plug into a PC.
1,Very low input level,"I bought this microphone to use for Skype phone calls, thinking it would provide better sound than my PC mic. Man, I couldn't have been more wrong. The mic records at very low levels which makes it virtually useless. I have tried it with voice software, and the levels have to be be turned up so far that the recording then has other noise on it. I don't think there is a single possible use for this mic, it is just a really low quality item."
2,Good price but not sensitive enough,Purchased this mic at Walmart for a good price but had to return it because it wasn't sensitive enough. Used with a mixing input on boombox. Had to turn gain almost all the way up to get any usable signal.
3,a good mic at a good price if you use it right,"These are dynamic microphones and will not directly replace the condenser microphones used by PC sound card mic inputs.However, if you use a small mixer and route it to the sound cards stereo input, your in business and capable of vastly superior recordings over PC condenser mics.the reason behind the mixer requirement when using this is in the difference between condenser and dynamic microphones.a condenser microphone controls voltage to create a signal.a dynamic microphone creates a small voltage to create a signal.As a result, a PC sound card requires a preamp (represented by a mixer) to bring the signal up to something the PC inputs can hear.Once properly addressed, this product will operate in an environment where a fair review can be made.There are better microphones in this category, but if the above requirements are met, you will find this mic will provide a crisp clean sound far superior to most PC mics"
2,French Suites,"Sure, Mr. Brookshire playes these pieces well. I've been playing them since 1973. The problem I have with this recording is the harpsichord. It has a sound that drives me through the roof. It sounds like a poorly made kit, French style. A poorly made Flemish style harpsichord would do the pieces better justice."
5,Best Book Ever,The only thing worse than having an itch in a place you can't scratch is not owning this timeless literary touchstone. Probably the greatest book ever written.
2,RE,After enjoying I love America this album just didnt have the magic he seems to have been able to produce earlier..the album just needed a little more steam and vocal commitment....maybe a little mood enchancement much like Pousezz at the time...
3,Mark Schultz,I really loved the song Remember Me. That song alone made the cd a great purchse. Mark Schultz in a great singer and writer.
1,SCC / MWS Rip off,"So, I've listened to the record and I must admit that I think it is a basic rip off of SCC and MWS. If you listen to ""Come on Lets Go,"" you just might be tempted to sing ""Come on let's go, I'm Diving In."" Did Schultz mean to copy Steven Curtis Chapman? I found the record to be over produced and boring."
4,A very good debut,"Plan on Mark Shultz being around for awhile provided he continues to release music like this. He demonstrates a good range of power (""I Am the Way"") and tenderness (""He's My Son"") with some playfulness (""Let's Go"") wedged in between.In a style similar to Michael W. Smith, Shultz features keyboard-influenced tunes that fit well within today's pop music. The lyrics demonstrate a maturity in thought as themes ranging from fun and light-hearted (""Let's Go"") to deeper and heart-wrenching (""He's My Son) are expressed.Shultz's ability to touch emotional buttons will endear him to many fans. Probably no two songs demonstrate this better than ""He's My Son"" and ""I Am the Way"". While tears may fall when listening to the former tune, joyful dancing may break out during the latter.Mark Shultz brings us a new voice in the well-charted waters of pop music. He does a good job of writing and performing melodic tunes that prove pleasing to the ear and tender to the heart."
5,Breathtaking...,His lyrics...the emotion he puts into each and every song...I have cried on so many occasions listening to some of his songs...and the lyrics hit so close to home. This man is a wonderful artist.
5,Life changing,"This CD was recommended to us when we were on holiday in Florida earlier this year. Little did I know then how much impact the CD would have on our lives. We have a young family and work long hours. After hearing ""Let's Go"" and ""He's my son"", and shedding several tears, I gave in my notice and decided to let God take control of our lives. These two tracks in particular (and I am sure God's help) made us realise what is important in life. God bless you Mark Schultz - more please."
5,Mark Schultz will touch your heart so huge with God's love,"In about 2001, I was listening the the radio when ""He's My Son"" came on, Tears just streamed down my face. Mark Schultz is so real in his lyrics and music, this is a song where a mother is crying out to God because her son is dying, and she says to God:""he's my son"" and so many of the other songs just emit God's ever fervent love for all of us. I love Mark Schultz's music. ""Cloud of Witnesses"" is another of his marvelous songs he sings about our childhood churches and how the members led us towards Christ without knowing it, our Sunday School teachers and the church members who just loved us well and how they all flock back when one of us dies :)"
3,One good song,I liked this cd as a kid...was stolen so i got again later in life and found that there was really only one good song. Things are never as you remember them as a kid are they (frown)
1,THIS CD BLOWS!,"Alright, cool, now that I have your attention. This CD is rad. I'm not going to be all generic and say something like ""It's the best cd to come around along in a LONG TIME!"" Or ""What a fabulous and refreshing new sound, it's never done before!"" Truth is, I hear a lot of good music everyday and as much as these guys wish they had a new eclectic sound, it's not. It's not new, but it is good in any case. Especially ""Six Feet Under"", ""It's OVer Now"", ""Motor"", ""Same Old Story"" and ""Skyfall"". Come on now, I've just named half the CD, that's more than enough songs to get you to buy this. Support Neve, they're pretty good. Good music is always good. In fact, good music is the key to world peace. Buy Neve. That's my story and I'm stickin' to it. Cheers, everyone."
4,A Great New Sound,This CD is excellent. It is a good change from the N*Sync and Backstreet boys sound. It is a mix between Gred Day and Savage Garden. They are great and so sweet.
5,Trip and Glide To This,"After a long hiatus, Michael Raphael(ex- Jailhouse ) and Co. return with a 5 star/in your face /rock and roll machine called Neve. After the release of the single ""It's Over Now"" just a little less than a year or so ago on the Faculty soundtrack and "" Skyfall"" on the "" Here on Earth "" OST just recently, these fine musicians have made quite an imapct on Rock Radio for many years to come. It's not often that you hear a track from a band , who tours constantly with absolutley no product available to public and that has received this sort of praise since the likes of Matchbox Twenty just recenlty or Collective Soul a couple of years ago. The songwriting ability of this band shines on songs like their smash ""It's Over Now"" , "" Freefall"" , "" Drift"" and my personal favorite "" Trip and Glide"" ( guys if you read this , make this next single--please!) Do you self a favor, buy it--because you won't sorry you did."
4,Great video for those who love skiing/snowboarding,"The good:* This is an awesome video for everyone who loves snowboarding or skiing* The characters in the movie make it fun to watch and I keep wishing the movie was longer!* The movie is edited very well with a good amount of funny, scary, pretty and awesome sceenes.* The jumps and tricks that the snowboarders in the movie perform are stunning, I wish I was as good as they are!* Don't miss the additional scenes in the DVD option. They are as fun and are at least 5-10 min each!The annoying:* The movie is not in High Definition as I expected. Some scenes would be so much more beautiful and effective if only this was in HD.* When you play the movie, the japanese captions turn on automatically, and it takes a bit of time to turn them off (didn't know I was buying a Japanese version).I bought it as a gift and we all watched it together! Amazing inspiration! Would buy again!"
5,Good sound for small venues.,I never expected these speakers to sound as good as they do. Power is enough for small venues. Very recommended.
4,Good powered monitor for the price,"Very good value for the price - Amazon had the best price plus free shipping.To get the best sound out of it, make sure that the input/signal going in, is balanced. I use a D.I box with the xlr cable plugged to the back of the speaker. It does the job for small gigs."
5,Encouragement For All,"The day I heard Humpty Dumpty After the Fall read out loud,I knew that I had to purchase it for my family that day.This book has so few words, but carries a big message of hope,love, and compassion. Very enlightening.I read the book to my son Cameron and he loves it!I look forward to reading more of the authors work."
1,sloppy piece of racist nonsense,"Once again, Robertson slaps together a poorly sourced work championing the slaveholding South. True to form, he neglects to mention the source of many of Jackson's maxims, Benjamin Franklin, in whose autobiography many of them can be found -- as any competent American historian would know."
5,SOLDIER OF THE CROSS,"Regardless of who actually originated the maxims that Stonewall collected, what is amazing to me is how steadfastly he followed every single one of these sayings incorporating them into his own character. Each of these sayings was a command, which he seemed to take to his soldier's heart, as if it had come from G-d Himself. I'm sure he wasn't thinking of publication when he collected these, nor was he submitting it for an academic grade, lying that every single phrase had originated from his gray (intensely) matter. He was an amazing gentleman, and please don't ever get rid of West Point. Some fine people come out of that institution."
3,"initially engrossing,gradually becoming predictable.","""oaths and miricles""was like march,coming in like a lion and out like a lamb.the reader was set up to anticipate a truly horrific denouement,instead recieving a less than shocking explanation."
2,Too many characters,"Kress tries to pull off four main viewpoint characters in 400 pages and fails. She has a great opening hook, and then the Vegas showgirl we followed for the first 25 pages hardly gets mentioned. Then the reader is alternated between a ex-marine with a drinking problem who wants his kids back, an FBI investigator who is stalking his ex-wife, and the wife of a deceased researcher who just found out he was having an affair. Each of these four 'main' characters come with supporting casts of three to ten minor characters.On top of all that, Kress is trying to write a science fiction based mystery novel where the bad guys are the mob. Kress needed to pick one story and write it, instead of meandering.Too many disparate elements jammed together forced the cliches to bubble up to the top. Predictable end. More a dysfunctional screenplay than a novel.Honestly, the best thing about the book was the title. I think ""Oaths and Miracles"" is a wonderful title. Bad novel though; not recommended."
2,Oaths and Miracles,"This is the second book by N. Kress that I have read. Unfortunately for me I have Beggars.. waiting. The characters were completely unbelievable. The science was really thin. I kept waiting for something REAL (characters, science or plot) If this was the first book I had read by Kress , I would not ever have ordered beggars."
2,Aquatica Aquarium 3D,"I have always wanted an Aquarium Screensaver and I have tried the download version of Aquatica 3D and was fairly satisfied until I read, in order to get the full version you have to buy it. I tried unsuccessfully to buy one online and in the stores and found they were no longer for sale. I got this version and was very disappointed as to how it loaded on the computer. I had to install it and uninstall it twice in order to get it to work properly.The instructions were not very clear as to the order of installation. When it was installed the fish were not as big as I thought and the number of fish I requested were not always in the aquarium I chose. It also takes forever to load when the screensaver is activated.When the mouse is moved in mid activation it will not respond until the screensaver is fully activated. All in all, I can see why this version was discontinued and no longer for sale."
1,watch out if you have the new windows vista,if you have the new version of windows vista it just does not work right
2,I wouldn't buy this product again,"At first when I received the toothbrush for my daughter, I noticed the princess looked more like a man dressed as a princess rather than a woman or a girl. But I let that go because I doubted my daughter would notice. Then after only two uses the battery is pretty much dead to where when she puts the toothbrush on her teeth the spinning stops. The screw to take off the bottom is so small I don't have a screwdriver to be able to take it off to replace the battery. I'd have to have an eyeglass screwdriver to be able to replace the battery which I don't and would rather not have to make another purchase to fix this hideous toothbrush. I wouldn't buy this toothbrush again."
1,This game bites...,"I'm assumming that no one will ever really see this review, but when I saw that someone had given this game 4 out of 5 stars, I felt it was my civic duty to tell the TRUTH about this game...it's terrible. Owned this game in the heyday of the sega ganasis back in the early 90's. And yes...I begrudgingly went through the entire game start to finish.The first Hydlide was bad enough, but this one is even worse. The ""battle"" sequences are you running into enemies over and over again until one of you disappears. There is no skill to the combat. The graphics, music and controls are all a mess. The story makes no sense at all.THE ONLY WAY YOU WILL EVER BEAT THIS GAME IS TO USE A WALKTHROUGH. It's ONLY saving grace is that the game is SO bad that it's actually kind of funny to play for a minute or two just to get a chuckle out of your friends. I still can't believe they made a sequel to Hydlide in the first place. As my daddy says, ""You can't put lipstick on a pig""."
2,NOT a picture book,I was very disappointed with the pictures in this book. They are not good clear pictures. The description information was helpful but wish I had seen this book in person before I purchased it.
1,Don't Bother!,The magnets on these things are NEVER strong enough to hold them to a moving car. One pothole and there goes your key. You won't even know it's gone... until the day you lock yourself out and go to look for it.If you want to attach a key to your car use industrial-strength or Extreme Velcro or at least use a keyholder that has a neodymium magnet. Don't make the mistake I did!
3,Confused,"Yes, this book is an English translation of Gil Vicente's Boat Plays, considered one of the great works of Portuguese literature. Unfortunately, it's a translation into rhyming couplets in very flat English. Did Vicente write in rhyming couplets? Was his Portuguese as unpoetic as this translation is? I find the latter, at least, hard to believe. The sketchy introduction provides little context or insight. Also, the translation appears to have been done for a particular performance in the UK, so certain significant adaptions have been made and stage directions have been included with the text. Is any of this valid? I don't know.The bottom line is I finished this book with no idea whether what I had just read was a genuine reflection of the Boat Plays or not. Somewhere there must be a better translation with properly extensive notes that give the necessary insight into the language and much-needed context (historical and theological) of this significant collection of dramatic literature."
5,This book is Great !,"I like the book because is full of positive messages in every circunstance whether you answer is yes or no, it's all good is a good conversation piece and lot's of fun."
3,You get what you pay for,I bought 2 of these conforters (King and Queen size) and they are great EXCEPT that they are sized to cover just the top of the bed - they are not large enough to hang over the sides of the matress! The picture on the packaging shows the conforter hanging over the sides fully covering the mattress and this is NOT what you are going to get. It's a shame that NSP used this deceptive practice for what is otherwise an excellent product. To get overhang buy the King if you need the Queen size.
4,Clever Tale!!!,"Scavenger Reef is the story of an artist whose death could increase his net worth into the millions!! An art dealer schemes to make big money when the artist is reported dead, money that will set her up for life, at a time when her options are quickly running out. As the grand scheme proceeds, several people who own paintings realize that they too can make enough money to dig themselves out of the holes they have dug. The only problem is, what if the artist is in fact alive? Who would be willing or desperate enough to keep the money making plans moving forward, even if that would involve lies, betrayal and ultimately murder.I found the characters to be entertaining and borderline zany!! What they lack in moral spine , they make up for with an earnest enthusiasm for doing the wrong thing in pursuit of the almighty dollar. This is a tale that romps through-out Key West in the ""classic- Florida"" manner of taking the story way over the top!!!"
2,no sparkle in this 'comic' mystery novel...,"After enjoying a few Laurence Shames novels, especially his wonderful 'Sunburn', 'Scavenger Reef' was a total disappointment. While the story has some promise (exposing the hijinx of art collectors and dealers) it winds up being very uneven, and an often a tiresome read. The characters are diverse yet completely unlikable, and I lost interest in the plot early on. Unlike his other books the magic and craziness of Key West doesn't shine through at all.Bottom line: a mess. Best avoided. Read 'Sunburn' instead."
5,"Scavenger Reef, by Laurence Shames","Laurence Shames is the greatest ... I wish he would start writing again. This novel goes well beyond the ""tropical mystery"" genre; it's really an intelligent and engaging thriller -- and the characters live!"
2,"Tried hard, couldn't finish it.","I listened to this book (on CDs) and kept listening, hoping that it will get interesting. But no! Finally, about a quarter of the way in the 7th CD -- it's only on 8 CDs! -- I finally had to chuck the CD out and move on. If there was some neat twist in the end then I lost out, but, given the rest of the ho-hum novel, I doubt it."
2,A Weak Immitator,"Although this book attempts to set itself in the same colorful ""wacky Florida crime"" world of Elmore Leonard and Carl Hiassen, it falls totally flat. The idea is kind of nice, a beloved Key West painter goes missing in a storm and is presumed dead. His agent holds a memorial show of his work in an attempt to drive up the price of the posthumous painters work., this results in a canonizing review by a super-influential critic. A little later a Sotheby's auction is arranged and his friends, agent, and others all try and cash in on the painter's new cachet. Meanwhile, he comes back from the dead, throwing a spanner in everyone's plans! So, someone tries to kill him to maintain the value of the art. It's a neat idea, but not particularly well executed. Airplane reading at best."
1,"Cheap, but you get what you pay for","Item was inexpensive, but came with one grommet and it was at the bottom left of the flag which made it hard to hang."
5,Peace baby!,"I had another flag from Amazon just like this, and it lasted for years! I'm sure this will do the same."
5,Greast Flag,"This is one of the best items I ever bought. The colors are very vibrant, from both sides!! This flag is perfect for my dorm! Its a little bit thin, but that makes it easy to hang on a wall. If I had more wall space I would definately buy more!!!"
3,Caution!,"Even though the picture states ""not actual image"", it's easy to think it's the entire bearing set. The single bearing is for the pulley end. The price is similar to locally purchased items, so it's not a rip off, just easy to misunderstand."
1,Defective camera,"I purchased this camera in March of 2002. I have had to send it for repairs twice already, for the same problem. The second time I asked for a new camera. I was told I would probably get a refurbished one, rather than new. I took 3 pictures with the ""replacement"" camera and the same thing happened. I am not a happy camper. I will never spend this much on a digital camera again, when much less expensive ones seem to work just as well or better."
4,I love it!,"This is my first digital camera. It's very easy to use. The pictures turn out great. The usb connector makes it very easy to download to my computer. I bought the rechargable batteries and unit, which saves on money. I am still learning how to use the other features. The only negative is how to adjust picture quality, such as if something is too dark. I guess I need to read my manual again."
3,Technical difficulties,"I owned the 3.3 megapixel camera for about 2 months before it started having ""disk error"" messages - so I returned it and upgraded to this one. The ease of use and photo quality are fantastic, but the usb connection (not sure if it is the cable or the camera port) is hokey. I have to hold the cable, quite forceably, in the camera usb port, for uploads onto my laptop. Good picture quality, but there seem to be some quality control issues."
3,"Good camera, but better ones are available","Overall, this is a nifty lil' 3 megapixel camera.Pros:Solid contruction.Ample featuresExcellent image qualityEase of useGood value for moneyCons:Toshiba is not really a camera mfr. Amazon sells better cameras made by camera-only mfrs.Lacks more advanced features, such as appropriate ISO step boosts.Internal flash can cause red-eye too oftenAlthough this camera has a lot going for it, don't get it. Amazon features many more cameras in the 3+ megapixel range that are superior. In particular, for a similar price as this one, look at the Nikon Coolpix line of excellent digital cameras."
1,toshiba doesn't honor warranty,"Don't have a problem with a Toshiba product or you will be on your own and have a useless camera! Toshiba said too bad, good luck, goodbye $$$$$ when our Toshiba stopped working. No more Toshiba products for us."
3,not as expected,"I thought that this would have been better than other similar products I have tried but was disappointed-- it is comfortable but on the other hand , does not hold in the tummy area as well as other(more uncomfortable) brands. It seems that you have to give up comfort for results.Also, the top does roll down after wearing it for a while."
2,hardware issues,"Worked nicely for the first week, had hardware issues but dealing with manufacture to get them replace was rather pleasant. Would buy from this manufacture again without a doubt."
5,Good Switch,"I have installed 4 of these switches. They are plug and play. The ones I have installed do not have a fan and are totally quiet. This unit runs very cool; it barely gets warm. The first one I installed was about a year ago, and I have had no problems. The switches are not managed, and if you need to set up virtual LANs you cannot do that."
3,24 port switch,"Worked as expected with simple plug and play setup. In good physical condition, no damage.Still working after 2 months in service at local schol computer lab."
4,Works fine.,Works fine for an unmanaged switch. I do get some lag streaming from my media center to my Xbox but i'm not entirely certain its the switch.
4,Awesome Product and I'm a network novice,Length:: 0:33 MinsUsed in a coworking space that is wired to patch panels in a networking closet. Connected the panels to the switch via cheap RJ-45 cables and we had a solid network running. Using a basic wireless router from LinkSys with this as well; very good price and quality.
5,24 port gigabit,"Fast shipping, good packing. Now I can remove all the 4s, 5s, & 8s from the jungle, much cleaner approach at the hacienda & room for expansion too. Good product !!"
2,Not reliable for a work network.,"Within 1 month I started to receive glitches on one of the ports. It took a while to realize that it was the switch, since the problems were intermittent. Now I have 5 ports giving errors and have therefore replaced the switch.Update Feb 2012 - I sent the unit back to D-Link and they sent me back a refurbished unit at no charge and paid for shipping. I am now using the unit on my home network for the past month and so far, so good.The fan is quite loud and would not be appropriate in a living or work space. I have mine in my basement workshop."
5,Solid performer,This switch did great - replacing a defective trendnet gigabit in our home. D-link rocks.
5,VERY SATISFIED,"AT FIRST LOOK, I THOUGHT THAT I COULD PAY A LOWER PRICE FOR THE SAME TYPE OF SWITCH, BUT I AM HAPPY THAT I CHOSE IT. IT WAS VERY EASY TO SET UP AND WILL ADJUST TO ANY SPEED CARD THAT YOU HAVE ON THE NETWORK. IT IS COMPACT AND ATTRACTIVE. I'M HOPING THAT IT IS ALSO DURABLE. SO FAR, NO PROBLEMS WHATSOEVER. VERY SATISFIED!"
4,Pleased with the holder & service,I placed the order on Friday and received it in the mail on the following Monday. It appears well made and holds the phone firmly face out. The phone can be removed with ease.The test will be to see how it holds up.
3,motorola swivel phone holster,I like the holster itself but I have alot of those plastic phone protectors for my phone and the clip wont fit my phone with these covers on the phone.
3,This is a toy,"I was suspicious of the price but I thought, what the heck. IT works but not very effectively. As you move, it keeps hitting one of the outside buttons and it is prone to allow the phone to come out. I would not rebuy it. but, if you need a cheap backup, this is it."
4,great iteam,This is great holster but only problem is you have to take the holster out to charge your phone.
3,Razr belt clip,"Product arrived promptly and although it's design is a bit different and it's built somewhat lighter than the original Motorola product, so far it seems satisfactory."
2,cheap,it was cheap- so that's good. it blocked the charging port so i cut out a small hole with a file so i could plug it in without removing the phone. it lasted about six months. i'd buy two if i did it again.
2,It Works...,"This item works, but is not quite practical for my V3m. The item holds the phone. However, I have to remove the phone from the holder in order to charge the phone. I also have an issue with the phone's camera lens rubbing against the top of the holster every time I open the phone. Looks like I will continue to carry the phone in my pocket."
1,Very Brittle Plastic,"The belt clip holster holds the phone nicely. There weren't any issues with the phone falling out. Unfortunately, the plastic the clip is made from is quite brittle. At first a corner snapped off, eventually the post that holds the belt clip at the rear broke off while getting out of the car. The clip survived about 3 weeks, whereas the original clip I got with the phone lasted 3 years (with a lot of abuse)."
1,Too good to be true,"The concept is good but the product did not last 2 days. The prongs that hold the phone in place are so small and fragile that they broke off. I did not notice that the prong on the left top broke off until my phone fell out of the holder and hit the pavement. Bad purchase, would have been even worse if the fall had damaged the phone."
3,I LIKE JULIO,"THE FIRST SONG ON THIS CD IS FANTASTIC. THE REST ARE RATHER MEDIOCRE. I LIKE THE ""TANGO"" ALBUM BETTER."
4,Julio Iglesias at His Best,"Enough has been about the artist and the album. I'd just like to endorse the songs ""Corazon Partia"" and ""Vida"". Julio Iglesias is at his best in these two lovely songs."
2,A lot of infor,"The Ultimate Airbrush Handbook (Crafts Highlights)This book does cover a lot of ground. Everything from Fine Art, to Car and Motorcycles, to Finger Nails and Modelling, but I don't beleve it gives any of them the space needed to give a good comprehensive view. This book is great, if you what to know the verity of uses for an Air Brush, but if you want a of how do you do this. Find another book."
3,My review,It's chock full of different tutorial types. From model building to fingernail airbrushing. It has become VERY useful.
5,Air Brush discovered,"I bought an air brush to paint diecast models. I soon realized it could do much more than spray gray paint on toy tractors and also that I needed intruction if I was going use this tool effctively. I choose Ms. Shanteau's ""Ultimate Airbrush Handbook"" - a wise choice. Very clearly written, excellent illustrations and meaningful exercises. Many aspects of airbrush work covered in detail. This is an excellent instruction book."
5,Comprehensive Excellence!!,"The ""Ultimate Airbrush Handbook"" is exactly what it's title says is! No hyperbole in the title. It covers all aspects of airbrushing, useful to everyone, including newbies like myself. Well worth the money spent!"
4,Great for Most Issues,"Now don't get me wrong; this book really is great and is very in depth. For a noob like me, it is ideal. However, for some specific issues, it does not tough on, which I kind of expected. Some issue just require buying the manufacturer's manual to get the full report. However, this in depth book will be sufficient for 99% of people and I highly recommend it."
1,Worthless for 2001 Avalon,"The 2001 Avalon is the second generation of this model. Everything I looked up in the ""Body"" section showed photos or diagrams of the FIRST generation Avalon (produced through 1999), which are completely different from my 2001. I'm shipping this back tomorrow.Incidentally, I was able to eventually find all of the information I needed (for free) by doing a web search. Next time I will do the web search first!"
3,Guide to your car,"This manual is not just for the grease monkey, but for the average car owner. Even if you don't do the work yourself, this guide will give you an idea of the work involved and educate you as a consumer if you ever need to take your car in for repairs. It is also a nice reference if you buy a used car and the original manual is missing. It has a maintence schedule as well as a troubleshooting guide.Since the manual covers multiple makes and models, I found some of the photos and directions inaccurate when it came to my 98 Camry 4 Cylinder 2.2L. Although this did not give me great confidence at first in doing my work, in the end it didn't matter."
2,Not very helpful,Not detailed enough to be helpful. I read the meat of it in 1/2 hour and didn't feel like I learned anything new about houseplants. 99% of the information was either common sense or information you can get from those plastic markers that come with plants.
1,Sophomore effort,"Someone gave me this CD as a gift, and it's amazing I still talk to the person. This CD is full of bland, flat performances from a strained, undertalented, overblown tenor who should have retired, or better yet, never have started his career.The only reason this CD is worth owning is to have a recording of Hoiby's ""Be Not Afeard"" which is a beautiful piece totally murdered by the performer.On the bright side, this is a perfect gift for someone you hate!"
3,Are you sure this is a biography?,"More of a social history of cartoons and the movies and the common man, than that of an unbiased look at Walt Disney.I felt that the author believed himself above us common Midwest, small town folks, and felt pity on us that we didn't know that we were stupid and liked such low brow things like Mary Poppins, Snow White and Silly Symphonies. I think he equates pop culture with trash. I guess the millions and millions of people around the world that just want decent entertainment, and not some hidden meaning that needs interpretation, are fools. Or is he just jealous?"
4,"Good, but not great","The book is definitly an in depth coverage of what happened in the early years of the Disney company, but it's definitly more of a history of the company than a biography of Walt."
1,What a load of Dung!,"I bought this book thinking it would offer a balanced critique of the Walt Disney Company and its internationally recognized commercial output- instead, I was subjected to 300 pages of personal attacks against Walt Disney (virtually all unfounded and based on what can only be described as intangible conjecture). The author seems to view himself on a quest to destroy the ""evil"" Disney empire- the only destruction he achieves in this poor cobble of anti-Disney reviews is of his own reputation as an objective author of literary merit. Do not insult your intelligence with the words of an author who so revels in ascribed self-importance!"
3,There's a Better Bio on Disney,"I recently read both this and Neal Gabler's ""Walt Disney, Triumph of the American Imagination,"" and Gabler's book (recently released) is an extroardinarily well-written (and detailed) attempt to give a balanced version of Uncle Walt. This book, unfortunately, has a point of view that is unwilling to take note of contrary evidence (although there is an interesting story here about the Disneyfication of American Culture, this book is simply too one sided."
4,Good Webcam for the price.,"Purchased this webcam about 9 months ago. It was difficult to setup but once I got it working it is really quite amazing. I also experienced the frequent lock ups which would require unplugging the webcam in order to reset it - a problem if you have this installed in a remote location. DLink has released a new downloadable (www.dlink.com) firmware upgrade for the webcam. Since I have installed this firmware release (ver 1.02), I have not had any lock up problems. For the price, this webcam has the best feature set out there."
2,Camera locks up frequently,"I'm on my second DCS-5300G. I sent the first one back because it was locking up all the time. The replacement is also locking up, I guess I'll have to send it back too. I would avoid this camera, at least until they fix the problems. When it works, Video quality and features are OK."
1,Don't bother buying this camera!!!!,"I have owned 2 of these cameras over the past few years. The pros: Great features, easy set up, good video quality. Cons: After a while the Pan dies, then the tilt, then the fan starts to make a lot of noise then the cameras just dies. Both cameras died the same way. I have 3 high quality commercial grade cameras that have worked well before and continue to work flawlessly. I would NOT ever buy one of these cameras again."
1,Worst product and service I have ever experienced,"Horrible product, very poor video quality. Constantly stops working. D-link has the worst customer service I have ever experienced. Don't buy from this company under any circumstances or you will regret it as I have. If I could give them -5 stars I would!"
1,One of the worst network cams on the market,The camera Locks up many times. It is certainly not for those who want this camera to be monitoring all the time.The software is messy. It goes to full screen mode and never comes back. Ideally when you are away you would be contrlling the PC through remote. It is very difficult to control this from a remote location.The software lacks the ability to auto detect the camera at startup.The software is poorly written by by someone who has never been in this business.DLINK has no support at all.Please Don't waste money in this camera.
2,Good camera for price. Dlink support is horrific,"The camera itself is pretty good for the money. A camera like this would have cost more than triple the price three years ago. I didn't experience any technical issues with the camera but I did need to call support regarding a browsing issue.D-Link support is one of the worst I have ever dealt with. The support person asks a question then puts you on hold for 2 minutes just to ask another question. And the questions have nothing to do with the problem. Things like do you have another network cable you could use (On a wireless camera!!!!). Or, do you have an activex installed (any activex or one in particular you like?) or, do you have mpeg-4 (sure, I keep it in my pocket?!?!). After 30 minutes of stupid questions, they hung up on me. So as long as you know what you are doing and are capable of handeling it all by yourself, you are OK with this camera. Need help? Don't buy."
3,D-Link DCS-5300G Video Work Around,"I recently purchased a D-Link DCS-5300G for home surveillance. Problem is the camera will ONLY work with a PC and ONLY on Internet Explorer. I don't use Internet Explorer I use Fire Fox. My wife uses a Mac! I don't want to return this but I need a solution for another machine/browser.I found the FREE solution onhttp://wiseowltech.com/support/support.asp uses javascript, great code THANKS!"
2,Fit IS an issue...,"Don't disregard the comments about this pad set not fitting the ATW model. Radio Flyer makes several wagons and pad sets. The large ATW requires Radio Flyer set #BP29 (which Amazon does not carry). The smaller ATW model uses set #BP24.In short, I'd check the Radio Flyer site before finalizing your decision to buy. Otherwise you'll be returning product to Amazon."
1,Should not be listed in accessories for ATW Cargo Wagon,This does not fit the ATW Cargo Wagon and should not be listed as an accessory for it. The pads are to small and leave big gaps.
5,Great Addition,We bought these pads for the Radio Flyer All-Terrain Wagon that we purchased for our twin grandsons 1st birthday. Has to make the wagon much more comfortable. They do fit the wagon.Proud Gramma & Papa
4,Very helpful add-on!,"Make sure you check your wagon model before ordering!!! Can't stress that enough! Once you know, these are great for the wagon. I have two dogs and its much better than a blanket. Would recommend to anyone interested."
2,Outdated software,"This runs in a 16 bit emulation mode which means that you cannot toggle back and forth between this and other programs. It was designed for the days of DOS and Windows 3.1 and forces me to close and reopen some programs running in the background after quitting this program. That said, it's okay software. It's basically MS Paint with a few bells and whistles aimed at children. I would not reccomend it for any child who has not mastered pointing and clicking with a mouse. It was a little too advanced for my 3 year old although she enjoyed trying. I'm going to keep looking."
1,Not for Mac,"Two main disappointing points:a) it doesn't run on my Mac, andb) it runs on my Window machine, but doesn't read old mac KID Pix files."
1,Bad Pix,"This CD is highly over-rated. There is nothing much to it. Don't judge a CD by its cover. This CD is not what it seems. Mostly a drawing package, not very educational at all, and quite boring."
3,Book Gift to a young Mother,Although the material is meaningful and helpful.Only a motivated parent with finish reading it.Perhaps a Compact disc would be a better alternativefor presenting the concepts shared.
3,It was interesting....,I had to read this for a class I was taking. It is thought provoking and makes you think about how twisted the U.S. consumer system behaves.
2,Born To Buy,This book says a lot of the same thing right through it. Quite a boring book.That is my opinion.
5,The only valid way to feed dogs and cats,"Dr. Pitcairin's book gives you everything you need to feed your dog or cat using foods that most of us normally have in the house. The book contains some of the best hostolic treatments for most common injuries. I've used this book for the last 20 yrs, and have given it away as presents. The best there is on feeding your pets and caring them for."
5,Excellent source for natural and holistic nutrition!,"When my seven-year old dog, Sierra, developed an autoimmune disorder (megaesophagus), I was hurt, angry, upset, and all the other emotions you must go through with illness. Sierra was my best friend, and now she was terribly ill. After over $1,000 in diagnostic testing and Western medicine, I turned to a homeopathic vet, who gave me a few recipes out of this wonderful book. Even though Sierra had much difficulty swallowing and keeping foods down, the high-quality nutrients I was giving her by following these diets helped her to remain alert and happy for a few more months. She even gained some weight! Unfortunately, I had to make a terrible decision and sent Sierra on a beautiful journey where I hope she can, once again, eat whatever she wants! But these recipes continue with me, as I have a new pup, and two cats! You probably won't feed your furkids the commercial stuff after you read this book"
2,Not that useful,"Many people swear by this book, but I don't find it that essential. Most of the information was not especially useful or was common knowledge. Mainly I disagree with Pitcairn's use of grains in a dogs diet. Instead, I recommend New Choices in Natural Healing Dogs & Cats and The Nature of Animal Healing."
3,"Good book, but...","This was the first book I purchased in the field of nutrition for my dog.I am happy I did buy it, but it turned out that my dog was not doing well on grains. The recipes in the book (I am not sure if the newer edition contains more grainless recipes) all contained a lot of grains and ground meat. I found out later that a dog, as well as a cat, needs to use his teeth and jaws and that he needs to chew and tear. I still have the book and regularly consult it when I want to look up what to do in case of illness (I missed information on problems with the thyroid there).So: diet-wise I can't give it a good review, but I like the list of ailments and cures, as well as the first aid part!"
5,Excellent,"This book is wonderful. I have 2 dogs who were the pickiest eaters. They hated dry dog food. I heard about this book on NPR and decided to give it a try. They are very happy eaters now. Their breath is even better (despite the fact that they get garlic every day!), their coats look better, they act like they feel better. I highly recommend it. And it doesn't have to take alot of time. You can make it very quick and feel good about what you're giving them. The medical reference section is great too."
3,useful overall source book for your dog,"this book is decent in that it covers a lot of information. if you're looking for info on the overall health of a dog, this isn't bad. but if your looking for info on dog diets, then i would choose another book. the info on feeding/diets was very confusing for me, and i think for someone who's new to the idea of feeding raw or homecooked, this isn't what you need."
2,Not in the condition I expected,"This book was in very bad condition, several pages are missing and the book is very worn....not in the condition I expected for what I paid."
5,Unbelievably Logical!,"This was my first introduction to natural feeding for our pets, but it's absolutely logical. Dr. Pitcairn has written this book so that just about the time you ask ""Yes, but...."" he answers it in the very next paragraph. The difference natural feeding has made in the health of my pets is just too wonderful to explain in one little paragraph. I could never go back to feeding kibble now that I have been exposed to this! I recommend this to anyone who is having a difficult time with the health of their animals!"
4,My dog has never been happier,"When I first started feeding my dog using the homemade food recipes in this book I was skeptical. Now I've been converted. Newt actually looks forward to her meal times now instead of turning her nose up at the same dry chunks every mealtime! her coat has never looked better, and she is even bouncier (which is wonderful since she is now considered a 'senior' and was just diagnosed with a touch of arthritis).I felt as though by feeding her chunks of dry kibble I was treating her like a second class citizen. The ingredients in those foods are of such quality that starving people from a third world nation wouldn't eat them. Companion animals should receive as much respect and kindness as any person, and to feed them unhealthy rotten scraps would be considered abuse and neglect if they were a human child."
5,Excellant User Friendly Program,"You can make your projects as simple or complex as you want with this program. Features include cards, art projects, envelopes, banners, posters, and more. There are thousands of clip art images, and you can import your own photos, and then crop them with provided shape or by hand, you can even give them an older look. The choices of font are amazing! You can even create your own headlines, with different colors, textures, shapes, shadows, and outlines to add to the text. The program offers ready-made projects, assistance with projects, or you can create your own from scratch. With all the options for cards you'll find yourself making all the cards and invites you need for any occasion. You'll be amazed at everything you can create! Once you register your program PrintMaster will send you information about additional upgrades. All of which are affordable."
5,Vet Solutions Ear Cleansing,"I have always had problems with my dogs ears either after a shower or when he would go swimming, my vet reccommened this product, and it really works. I Love It!!"
4,Smells great,I use this after giving my pups a bath..it smells great and cleans excess water from their ears...I also use in between baths .
5,Thanks!,"Thanks for the great service. The product came on time, was packaged very well. I am a very satisfied customer."
3,"ok cleanser, revolting fragrance","As a cleanser the product is fine. The ""fragrance"" is sickly sweet, unnecessary, and unhealthy for humans and animals who are sensitive to it. Can't get the smell off my hands. Caused my sinuses to clog and made my poor dog wheeze. What is WRONG with these vet product manufacturers who put this stink in these products? At least - PLEASE make a fragrance-free version..."
5,Ear Cleansing Solution,"This is a great ear cleaner for dogs or cats. I've used it on St. Bernards, Newfoundlands, and now on our Cavalier King Charles Spaniel. The cleaner really works. I think of it as sort of an ear infection preventer. It's not at all greasy."
4,Hidden Talent,"Felicia Adams is a gifted singer/songwriter who debuted on the scene back in the mid 90's with an infectious single entitled ""Thinking About You."" Since then, she has been writing for other artists such as Soul 4 Real and Donnell Jones. A decade later, she has returned with a full length album that will satisfy any lover of good r&b music. Standout cuts are ""Hello"" ""You"" and ""Only You"". Her debut single ""Thinking About You"" is also included. Her music is along the sames lines of early Mary J. Blige and Faith Evans. This album is a rare gem since its not even released here in the states yet. So pick this one up. It's definately worth the price."
1,Something is wrong with these Walnuts,Something must be wrong with the Walnuts I purchased--I have opened two of the packages and they taste rancid. Maybe I got a bad batch but I would not recommend these to anyone. The first thing I have ever purchased from Amazon that I was not satisfied with.
1,Rancid on delivery - twice,"First of all, Amazon's customer service on this issue was perfect. That being said, our first shipment of walnuts was rancid and the replacement shipment was as well. I recommend - Sunridge Farms Organic Walnut Halves & Pieces, 5-Ounce BagsOrganic Walnut Halves--12/6 oz. bags. (We've ordered them many times and never had a problem.)"
3,love story for teen.,"The story is about 3 people. Alice, Randy and Glenn, who are in love, and about Alice's motivation to learn how to read and write. I like the story because it is interesting and we can see the motivation in each person in the story. I think this book is good for teens because most of them are in the same situation, I think they can learn many things in this story."
4,A teen girl fell in love with a sailor.,"This book talks about a young girl,who wants to drop out of school. She meets a young sailor and she falls in love with him.Three weeks later she recieved a big envelope from him.She didn't know how to read and how to write.She asked for help from a friend named Glenn.He helped her and at the same time he fell in love with her.I recommend it to young people and adults."
4,Youthful love.,"This story is about a young woman named Alice.She fell in love with Randy, a young sailor. Randy had to go but he always wrote Alice. Alice couldn't write or read, for that reason Glenn, Alice's friend, teaches her to read and write, but Glenn was falling in love with Alice.At the end Alice chooses Randy.I dislike it because I hoped that Alice would choose Glenn because he is an intelligent man and very nice.I think that young people would like to read this book because this book is talking about youthful love."
5,love letters,"The story is talking about a romance that stared in Seattle. Randy is a sailor and Alice, the older sister of four brothers.Alice helps her mother because she works. Randy came to her home one day looking for her because her friend Darlene talked to Alice about the sailors coming to the tonw. In a few hours they fell in love or something like that.When Randy had to go far away from Alice he didn't forget her and he wrote many letters to Alice.I like the romantic he was. I would recommend young people to read this book.It is interesting and a good example for girls like Alice."
3,good love letters,"If you like romantic stories, I recommend you to buyand read Love Letters. This story is about a young girl anda young guy who works in a submarine.This young guy is fromKentucky. Alice is the name of the girl from this story.She didn't know how to read and write and then when she metRandy, is the young guy's name, she improved her writingand reading. What I realy like about this book is that Aliceimproved because of Randy."
3,Falling in love,"The story is about love between teenages. I liked the way Alice was getting better in school and with herself. Love does miracles.It's a book for all ages, because it's easy to read and the language is easy to understand."
4,FALL IN LOVE,This story about a young girl and her name is Alice. She is high school students and she is fall in love with Randy and his is student of same school that Alice was studing. Randy always write to alice a letter and she doesnt know about read and write.Alice and Randy got fall in love with each other and they try to live a happy life..........
2,Shirt,I was disappointed in the colorthe size ran a little largeIt looks great on my sister'n-lawbut I had bought it for myself
1,I was decieved!,"I ordered this item under the impression that this was the complete game. I thought the only reason it was cheap was because it came in a jewel case, without a box. When I recieved the game it turned out to be a sample only. I was very disappointed. No where does it state in the description that it is a sample. I believe that this is very decieving. You should not buy this game unless you like to pay for a sample of a product."
4,Good pick,"I bought this book because Black and Decker's guide to electrical work was excellent. The plumbing version is good too, but would have benefited from more detail and basic information for beginners. This book has excellent pictures, a variety of types of projects and repairs, and generally good descriptions and instructions. I learned quite a bit from reading this book."
4,I like it.,I like it. Came in very handy. I would also recommend Black and Decker Codes For Homeowners. An excellent read.
5,You Can't go wrong,These books are great. I hate plumbing sometimes I don't know were to start but like i said in some of my other reviews I like B&D books and tools. These book are a great start.
2,Almost too many photos,"This book is chock full of photos; so much that it detracts from providing information. I was trying to use it to replace a leaking shower faucet, but couldn't find any useful info about my setup. All there was were pictures of valves that weren't mine. I would like to see more troubleshooting chapters, and more possible fitting/material variations outlined. For instance I would like to know how to go from plastic to copper to galvanized etc.Still if you doing a new install and have access to the exact material they use then it is good for that."
2,Not what I was looking for.,"May be great for some, but this book told me nothing I didn't already know, and I saw nothing that you couldn't find online with a couple of mouse clicks even if you didn't. I suppose if you know absolutely nothing about plumbing, this highly illustrated volume would be a nice first look to have on hand. I looked at the section on Pex, as I was about to undertake a project using it for the first time, but gained nothing beyond the obvious basic knowledge I already had in it's use. That one five minute look is it and I don't even know where the book is now."
5,very handy book,This is a great book for a beginner because it covers every plumbing task in detail with pictures. It would be good for the experienced as well because the book is set up in away that makes it easy to zero in on any topic you are interested in.
4,good,"I haven't used this a whole lot. I liked all the books in the series, I just don't find any of them good enough to make me feel I could do the work myself."
2,BLACK & DECKER GUIDE IS NO USE FOR THE UK,"I was so disapointed as I didn't recognise any of the diagrams as theis book looks like its written for the USA/Canadian market NOT for the UK so it has not been of any use to me. I assumed as I was ordering from the UK, that it would be suitable. I would like to return it, if I knew how"
3,Do you have a basement?,The book is great for beginners and will serve for renovaation projects. The major downside is that the authors assume you have a basement. Florida is a little short on basements.Were I to write a new edtion I would include instructions for homes with crawl spaces and slabs.The other thing I noticed is that there is little mention of how the plumbing project takes into consideration any electrical or HVAC systems. Perhaps that is not needed because building codes address placement of plumbing and electrical systems.A great remeinder book. I will keep my Kindle edition on my iPad close by during my project.
5,Black and Decker Complete Guide to Plumbing,I needed a book to help complete a project at my home. This book gave me every thing to complete the project. Clear written instructions and diagrams. I would recommend this book.
5,Great Book - buy it!,"This book is great - it offers color photos with detailed instructions. I used this book to remodel my entire kitchen - some plumbing work was involved - and everything I needed was in here. It even has a good section about PEX water system - new and advanced system. It has DVD, but of course no time to view DVD while your kitchen is apart. Highly recomend!"
4,Client comments:,The book is great. It came in excellent condition and in a very timely matter. Very happy with the order.
5,amazing book,"Because of the great reviews I decided to purchase this book and was very glad I did. This book gave me the confidence to tackle projects that I normally would have paid someone to do.I was always very nervous about sweating copper pipe together, but I followed the excellent step by step instructions and was amazed at how easy it was. The included DVD is also excellent as well showing very informative video of various projects.I highly recommend this book for the beginner on up."
2,The Complete Guide To Home Plumbing,"This book, The Complete Guide To Home Plumbing, (although the title is certainly misleading) is an OK book for general/basic plumbing information and is useful to most homeowners.The book is somewhat annoying in that almost every project or plumbing procedure you are looking at constantly refers you to other pages in the book. It seems that just as you are thinking you have a good visual grasp from the pictures, every other paragraph or sentence sends you away to some other page.All in all, this book is worth the money, but don't be surprised if you still need to Google for plumbing info on the net. This book is FAR from ""The Complete Guide..................."""
2,Complete Guide to Home Plumbing,"If you are looking for pretty pictures this is the book to buy. It is not a book for doing plumbing. Be careful before you follow the instructions, it is not adquate for detail plumbing. It just gives you the basics. For example it does not give you the required distances for most plumbing fixtures and shows notching many wood studs in the wall which could cause serious damage to the structure. Be Aware!!"
4,Most projects well covered,"This book is well written and certainly well presented, with excellent pictures to illustrate the task at hand.Its comprehensive on the topic of home plumbing with many tasks covered.I doubt whether there is a better and more up to date publication.However some constructive criticism; I would have appreciated more technical information at times. There was no reason as to why certain pipes or fixtures were used instead of others, whether it was in the code or the author had the experience to know, you had to accept it on blind faith.So I often thought when doing a certain project, ""why did they choose these products and methods.""Also there is very little on the subject of Gas plumbing except the installation of a Gas hot water tank."
5,Everything water related is in this book.,"I am in the midst of trying to figure out how replace my old cast iron plumbing that has so many deposits in it - it reducing the water flow. This book covers what you need to do , what you should do and with great pictures of how to do it. The book covers, installing a bathroom, fixing a facuet, how measure water flow, installing water heater and much more. I am very pleased with what is in the book. I highly recommend this book. I know I will be using this book quite a bit in the next few months as I tackle various projects around the house."
1,Useless!,"This book may be fine for doing your average home repairs, but for installing new systems--or doing anything that requires step-by-step, piece-by-piece information--this book is more frustrating than a warm six-pack on a hot day.I am not a plumber, but I'm the best thing my house has, and when you're putting in a brand new bathroom, including new supply, new drain, and new fixtures, you need to know the answers to simple questions like, ""How far past the drywall should the supply stub run?"" or ""How exactly do I install the toilet flange?"" This book has NONE of that information; in fact, I have repeatedly hit the end of a section thinking that there must be a page missing.If this is the best book out there, stick to internet searches. DIY websites have at least as much information as this book contains."
4,Not too shabby,"I am a real plumber, and I bought this as a bit of a reference guide. For the beginner or the DYI at home person that does not know much its a awesome book. A lot of pictures and a lot of instruction on how to do this and that. For me I was really hoping that it would have had a lot more plumbing codes(a section would of been nice). Also I think a reference section on pipes and their relevant information(how often you have to brace them,and so forth)could of been touched on more.Also I don't also recall it telling some plumbing no-no's which is bad for the home DYI'er such as galvanic corrosion and such. I think more mentions of these would have been helpful for letting a non-mechanically and knowledgeable individual from making costly future mistakes.But for the amount of colorful pictures and explanations, I think it is a fabulous book, but if your an actual plumber, I think it could only be used as a slight reference."
3,New Gas Pipe Articles is Lame,I got this book after reading they had added a black pipe chapter to the book. The book discusses black pipe for something like a total of 4 pages in total. The book does come with a pdf version which is great for looking up things while I am on the computer. Overall a good book but again not super detailed. There are very few code explanations given especially for the gas pipe pages.
5,Excellent Guide,"My husband and I are remodeling our 70-yr-old house, and he is redoing all the plumbing. He is using this book as a supplemental guide for code validation and instruction. The use of lots of photographs is really nice. He selected this issue because of the inclusion of PEX piping, which we are using. Excellent reference guide to keep on hand."
4,Headphones do the job,Good sound qualityFunctionalSeems to be well made.Ear hooks would make them better.
2,Poor sound quality,I had a similar product earlier. Compared to that one sound quality is really bad...
4,Good Earphones,"Got these for my son's cell phone which is also a MP3 player. Only downside was that the product didn't clearly indicate whether an adapter was needed so I bought one for nothing cause we didn't need one for the Sony Ericsson W350. But overall, good ear buds."
4,Great bang for the buck,I've tried other handsfree sets and this one provides the best mic and ear bud combo. The ear buds provide decent sound (lots of bass) and the microphone works great -callers can actually hear me on the other end of a phone call-. The only thing it lacks is a volume control nob on the mic.
4,Andy's view for review of sony headset,This is the good product to feel the music. It has true bass effect.But the only problem is that when i put this product in my jeans pocket the ear bud is sometimes lost.The better product in market.
5,Just as supplied with the phone.,"I imagine that I am not the only person to lose the headphone cable that comes with the phone. This will serve owners of the SE 810i phone. This particular product only came with the Medium sized earphone shrouds. The original with the phone comes with the interchangeable S / M / L shrouds. The good thing is that you can simply replace the earbuds with any other one. You can also buy just the shrouds, but it would be a far better investment to get a better pair of earbuds."
4,"Good, but little uncomfortable","Promptly deliveredWorks as expectedAbout the product: Doesnt fit to ear properly. Falls now and then.Over all, I would rate 4/5"
3,Everything good,"Mmmmm after talkin with a costumer representative they fix and gave me some opcions, I really appreciate the costumer service."
2,Handsfree earhpones,Cheaply made. The wires for the ear pieces where drastically differnt lengths which made it difficult for both ear phones to stay in place. Sound quality was ok. Price was right -- you get what you pay for.
2,arrives fast but low quality,I was disappointed in the quality of the product. You get what you pay for.
4,Awesome headphones,I got these headphones for my sony ericsson w350a and they work like a charm. Headphone equality was good for the price and the ability to swap in your own headphones is nice. My only gripe is that you can't use the ear buds them-self easily as the cord is mad short but since the adapter cord is long using them with the phone doesn't have the same issue. Overall great bang for the buck and the ability to swap in your own headphones is REALLY nice.
2,careful not to get the black version,"I just got the black version from MyNetDeals. The sound quality is nothing like the original one, there is no bass at all. All the music sounds terrible through this earphone. I would like to return it, but shipping charge is not refundable. Have to find another replacement."
3,best sound for inline mic headphones I have found,"these are really good headphones. However, they fall apart very easily I have had 3 pairs of these and they sound really good but do not hold up well. the middle part that has the answer button came apart . still works maybe need to supper glue it."
1,Knock-off. Read the reviews!,"Don't buy it! They may be knock offs. Read all the one star reviews. It apparently happens frequently enough with this vendor.The customer service was quick and polite, and offered a refund with no hassles, so that's a plus. But their excuse was ""We buy these items directly from manufacturer's distributor as oem headsets.""So, the ""manufacturer's distributor"" is sending knock-offs? Really? Sony's distributor is sending knock-offs? Hmmm.It's too bad, because the real ones are great little headphones."
2,Fair,"I was excited to receive my purchase. After just a week after, it stopped working properly. I had to hold and press the mouth of the handsfree to my phone to work."
2,Terrible sound,"The sound from the ear buds suck. Sounds like muffling, not clear.Stay away from this! Total waste of money."
4,Works well.,"This headset works well with the W350a. The headphones portion were detachable, so I plugged in iPod headphones instead. The original headphones' rubbery texture got easily tangled and weren't the most comfortable in the ear. The headset picks up radio frequencies good enough and the microphone picks up my voice quite well. I would definitely recommend this."
3,decent product,"This is a decent pair of in the ear headphones that works with most sony ericsson cell phones. The sound quality compares with any sub $10 headphones. The most disappointing part about them was the cable, it was stiff and didn't coil up well for storage. I blame that on the cheap plastic coating over the wire and also cheap wire. It would have been nice if these could have been made with OFC-Litz wire, but you get what you pay for."
2,Broken Item,"The rectangular plug that goes into the cel phone didn't work. One of the pins was noticeably cut in half (I compared it to the one that my phone brings) so I had to keep it pressed in with my hand for the phone to detect it.Also, the two ear buds were different sizes. Two stars because I ""suppose"" it would work ok had it come with everything intact and I did finally get it to work with a back-up plug I had."
5,Sony Ericsson Stereo Portable Handsfree HPM-70,"The handset works just fine with the adapter, however the connection port to the cell phone is a little different. I have to use the original adapter. The part that joins the earplugs to form the ""v"" is much stronger than the original. Thanks for prompt delivery."
2,Dissapointed,"I bought three of these so I would have backups for my w300i. Though they look identical to the ones that came with my w300i, all three of these are very, very tinny. The ones that came with the phone sounded fine. These came bunched together in a white box, not in the oem retail package; maybe they were seconds or something.I'm only giving them two stars because the adapter that hooks them up to the phone works OK (which is important, because they're hard to find locally. Earphones are easy to get anywhere). Also, they were at least cheap."
1,bad stuff,"The headset stopped working after few days. I guess it was a used one, badly used. Or defective. The original headset I got with the cellphone lasted for 2 years and survived washer and dryer!!!"
4,Great Headset,After using this headset i think i will not be using any other in the future performance is remarkable.. sound is perfect and most conveniant with its detachable jack great work from sony ericsson
3,"good headphones for music, not really for talking","The sound quality of these headphones is really good. Great bass and sound separation. The snug (but comfortable) fit in the ear makes these earphones great at blocking out background noise -- perfect for listening to music on noisy commutes. However, because of the sound blocking, using them as the earphones for a phone conversation is definitely hampered. With both headphones in, I find myself shouting or talking annoyingly loudly because I cannot hear myself speaking! Pulling one of the earphones out helps with this. So in my opinion, these are great for listening to music with your Sony Walkman phone, but not really for phone conversations."
3,Does the job,This is an OEM part and is cheap. The audio quality is good. I like it better than any blue tooth headset out there bcos it isolates outside road noise pretty well when i'm driving. The microphone is also very good ---- my callers say the clarity is good. It can double as ear buds for an MP3 player. The only drawback I see is the cord is way to short to connect to an audio jack of other devices. To connect to the sony phone - its nice and long bcos they give u an extension which has a phone specific adaptor at the other end. Like another reviewer mentioned they give u three pairs of ear buds each of a different size so that they fit better.On the whole decent buy. Good for hand's free driving specially.
2,I didnt like it,"Hi I got this head set few weeks ago, I have a problem with this head set one ear phone sound out put is good and other one is bad. Song wont be synchronized in both the earphones. I really hate it, its not the worth of the money. I am new to this place so I have no Idea how to return back this one and get the new, I just put on my table, its been lying on my table since I got, I didnt even use it for two days. Such a sad story.Sony Ericsson Stereo Portable Handsfree HPM-70I request if possible can I get the new one or replacement for my default earphone.Looking forward to hear from you.Thanking youVishwas"
5,Hi I need your help,Hi allCan any one tell me whether it will work with Sony Erickson W350 mobile since it is not enlisted in the advertisement of the product.Thanks
4,nice for price,"nice sound, works well, can't beat price. Still a SONY head phone with the left side much too short, much shorter than right. Very annoying. Why do they do that?"
5,great deal,fab price on outstanding quality ear buds...their SONY afterall...and they work with all min.pin style plugs too...
4,"Excellent quality, odd design","functionally its perfect, however the design leaves something to be desired. The right earbud is WAY too long.. i'm not talking about a little, its about 3 or 4 times too long. I read a review on another site that said the sound quality in the earbuds was good.. and they absolutely are, but the configuration is annoying and I bought a ""normal"" pair from somewhere else. I did not use the hands free so I cannot speak for that. This pair would be great if you wanted to share your music with a friend on a trip, you take the left short end and they can take the long right end, but other then that, I would recommend something else."
4,Worth the money,These headphones were a great buy. I'm using them with my sony ericsson cybershot K-800i phone. The quality was better than those that the phone came with with.
1,Misleading Image/Description,"This product will NOT work in your device (my Blackberry curve-8320) because it does not have a 3.5mm plug. It has a 3.5mm hole, which is useless. The hole fits into an extension for some other type of phone."
4,"Muy bueno, pero un detallito","WAO, tremendo sonido, ahora tengo una mini fiesta en mis oidos!! Me gusta mucho, lo compre primero para un regalo de B.D. y acabe comprandome uno para mi 20 dias despues. Solo me gustaria que la conexion donde se unen ambos cables de auriculares, los cables fueran en el mismo sentido, como los audifonos de iPods, o de mp3s, eso le da mas estetica."
1,Requires 2 adapters to work as 3.5MM headset,"Overall, its just a poor product. Sellers advertise this as a heaset when it is really a headphone with 2 adapters. The first adapter modifies the 3.5 MM stereo jack into a microphone, but then the other end is a 2.5 MM jack. You then need another adapter to go back to a 3.5 MM Female input on the phone. You wind up with a super long chord which easily gets tangled and a poor audio connection by going through so many adapters. Do yourself a favor and avoid this version and make sure you buy a headset that does not require adapters to work on your phone."
3,kept falling off my ear and the cord was too long,"the shipping was really fast, and i was excited to get the earbuds, the sound is really good, but there were two things that just annoyed me. the earbuds kept falling out of my ear and the cord was too long."
1,Had the worst experience with this headphones(sony ericsson stereo portable handsfree HPM-70),"Hi,I purchased this headphones a while ago.After using for three days i did not hear any sound from the headphones.so,i complained about this to the customer care services.According to my wish they replaced it with a new one.I felt happy after getting that,But the same problem and experience i faced with the new headphones too.I recommend not to purchase this headphones no more.This is my worst experience i had ever.I don't want to complain about this and blame the manufacturer.Thank you."
1,Defective Product,Product defective. Wanted to exchange for a working headset butinstead the company gave a refund. It is pretty waste of time.
3,Has proprietary Sony fast port connector,"Note, you can use this product only with a Sony Ericsson phone -- the phone must have the fast port connector to connect the microphone cord. Even though the earphones have a 3.5mm jack, it is too short (~6 inches) and cannot effectively effectively be used without the extension cord of the microphone. The microphone unit has a 3.5mm socket for plugging in the earphones; I guess the benefit being you can swap the earphones.The above wasn't clear from product description, and I mistakenly purchased it for my Samsung phone with a 3.5mm jack. It's a great product otherwise."
3,Authentic Sony accessory or knock-off?,"Item was sent quicker than thought, only a few days for shipping. Worked great but was questioning why left ear-bud cord was three times longer than right ear-bud. A few weeks later only one ear-bud was working but now it is working. Then the plastic covering for one of the ear-buds came off, which was easily fixed by taping it back on. Can't really complain since it was only 5 or 6 bucks. I guess you get what you pay for. Works for now though."
2,Poor sound quality,"The bass is great, but the mid-range and the treble is awful. The problem, it seems, is with the headphones. I tested the adaptor with better quality headphones and the sound quality was decent. Earplugs slip out frequently. The cord length is unequal, the left side being unusually short.Wouldn't recommend this product unless you don't want to spend too much."
5,nice buy,"My husband loves this headsets, is great to be able to buy discontinued items over here. They work great"
2,"It serves the purpose, but...",This little gadget serves its purpose but it gets beat up and scratched up very easily. I guess that is better than having the LCD damaged but after a couple of months of moderate to high usage of the camera and you pretty much have to replace this thing.
1,lousy customer service thus far,"I ordered two covers, one arrived broken. An initial email to the vendor Adorama has not resulted in as much as a reply. A second email was sent today. I have not had any problems with Amazon before, but I definitely will re-think any future purchases from this Amazon-associate vendor."
2,helpful in some areas of exam,"I just finished the exam last week. I made 400+ flashcards on the topics discussed in all the science sections (general, biology, and chemistry) and when I got home, I pulled out 25 of them that I was actually tested on. VERY disappointed. There were pages upon pages in the chapters talking about various explorers and geologic eras, yet the exam didn't even touch any of that. Waste of my time. I will admit the reading and math sections were great review. I had forgotten a lot of that stuff from college and high school. So, if anything, buy it for the math and English reviewing. However, it was a terrible study guide in terms of science. Too much stuff on topics that didn't matter."
4,just download for free,"I just downloaded this book for free from ventura county's online elibrary, they have a full career center with all the tests etc..your library does too!!!!!!! great book, just not worth paying for unless you need a hard copy, mine is on my ipod touch with ibooks. also free."
4,This should help,This should help my wife with her nursing exams. Seems to have all the requirements needed to get her going.
4,Has good and bad points,"I read this book for a class on the emergence of state society. The book was great for its review of Aztec ideology and its resulting effects on the society. Too many authors ignore the importance of the way people think. However, archaeological evidence does not support their conclusions about the Inca's ancestor worship. But the book was good read, very fast paced and enjoyable. I recommend it."
5,This book is excellent.,"It explains how modern/western thought fails when applied to the cultures of the Aztecs and Incas. This book is good for beginning students for the narrative is easy to follow. However, it is outstanding for the more advanced scholar. This book would make a great companion book to broader studies of these two cultures. The authors criticise modern archaeology for its dogmatic unbending views.The authors also take modern political theory and apply it to these ancient cultures. What happens is that it falls apart. Marx, Hegel, et al have met their match against these ancient ones. What a great departure from the faulty theories of socialism & communism."
2,Do we really need a reprint of an old and not very good book?,"The interpretations of the Aztec empire in this book were misleading and deficient when it was first published in 1984; now they are both bad and outdated. According to the authors, the driving force of Aztec imperial expansion was rabid religious fanaticism. Crazed bloodthirsty warriors supposedly ran around conquering peoples with no sense of planning of strategy, and with no economic motivation (sounds sort of like the bloodthirsty Maya of Mel Gibson's movie Apocalypto). This interpretation does not for work Apocalypto, and it does not work for the Aztec empire either.I'm not qualified to evaluate the Inka sections of the book. But if you are interested in Aztec imperialism, please check some of the post-1984 literature."
1,PS,"So I didn't finish what I needed to say so here it is. I am selling this item on Ebay for a penny if anybody wants it. It is very useful for making a fire or a foot rest. Maybe you could use the T pieces to make a key chain or a necklace so you can always remember that you played a game that was too boring and advanced for you. The game has never been played before, I tried but had an aneurism. Please buy this game and HAPPY NEW YEAR!"
1,The WORST game I have EVER played!!!,"This game is incredibly boring. The only thing you can do in this game is basicly an auction. If you like to ""Fire"" somebody else from an auction or play ""The Donald"" card to get back in the bidding this is a game for you. I suggest that you never buy this game. You might as well save your money."
4,Works good but manual not informative,"I have this DVD player for the past two years and it works great. However, I am still unable to record any VHS cassettes from television. The manual is very confusing."
2,works but there are better machines out there,I have owned this machine for about a year. It plays Videos and CD/mp3's just fine. But it is not the best dvd player. The dvd will skip during play back and it sometimes has choppy playback. I am sticking with the machine for now while I save up for a blue-ray. But don't buy this machine. You can find better ones for a similar price
2,Great features but very poor reliability,"Liked the features, nice quality picture, but had extreme problems with the DVD drawer. The drawer always gets stuck - not smooth moving in and out - and eventually the DVD would reject all disks (would try to read them and spit them out 99% of the time). Looking to replace this item. Stay away!"
2,Allegro vcr/dvd,"I bought this at circuit city 2 yrs ago for $40. It was cheap because of quality of unit. It does work well and I've not lost any tapes or dvd's. Picture quality from this is very fuzzy even if using it as a tuner. Once subtitle are on they stay on, you have to install a different dvd then back to the one you were watching to get subtitles off. The manual tracking doesn't work smooth either when watching tapes. But it does work, better than not having a dvd/vcr player."
2,Question,Is the DVD portion of this particular unit a DVD RECORDER or is it just a Player?I need a good DVD recorder as I have a Samsung VR-375 that crapped out on me after 3 years and I found it to be a very good unit for the 3 years that I had it before the DVD crapped out on me.Urgent Reply Requested
5,Out of Print and Hard to Find,Hard to find book was delivered on time and in the exact condition as described.
2,"Poor Design, Replacement Parts Not Available","This heavy steel tray appears to be appropriate for professinal use, and if treated very gently, it may last for years. However, the product is made in Taiwan, and the adjustment assembly relies on a key component that is made of plastic, and will eventually fail, causing the keyboard tray to dangle uselessly from the bottom of the desk. It appears that this part would not be difficult to replace, that is if Fellowes made the part available (which they don't). Also, the company apparently does not believe it is worth tagging the tray with a model name or number. But then, why would they bother to do so if they do not intend to provide parts or service for it anyway?"
1,"Doesn't last, poor design","This is supposedly a fully adjustable, steel keyboard tray. It is, however, poorly made, a mix of plastic and steel, and not fully adjustable. Plus the mouse tray is way below the keyboard level, creating ergonomic problems. I've had it for about 2 years, and came into the office this morning to find my keyboard on the floor, and a broken plastic part that no one seems to have a replacement for. Save your money, this is a bad choice."
1,Big Disappointment,This stand is not sturdy. It is very floppy. I have to prop the mouse stand up with wood. I highly recommend NOT purchasing this product.
1,Poor Quality & Poor Service,"The tray looks rather bullet proof. but it is not.It weight 12 LBS, but the hinge is weak thin plastic.It broker.I called fellows and they told me they do break. They admitted that they are not good quality.I guess I am screwedDo yourself a favwore and avoid anything made by fellow."
2,It does what it says...sort of.,"Technically, it works.... but it doesn't do what I needed it to do. The wireless mouse MUST be within 1 meter from the receiver. I needed to go about 6 to 10 feet so to me, this product is completely useless. It wasn't stated anywhere about it's limitations until the box arrived and opened the manual. Buyer beware."
1,don't let this mouse in your house...,"sounded like an excellent deal. love living a cordless life. this outdated thing works erratically. no matter how close u keep it 2 your computer, it intermittently loses contact and if you like 2 do things quickly and efficiently, forget about this conTRAPtion."
1,More Memoirs than Advice,"This book didn't stay in my library for long. I'm glad that I read it and I did glean some good ideas but it wasn't at all what I expected based on the title. I appreciate many of Ms. Maine's points but the book is not really about the Herbal Body Care Business. It's about creating a philosophy of business, really your Mission Statement, and the goals that produces. The philosophy is blatantly New Age and so, not for everyone. The best part is the many stories of other soap makers.Ms. Maine is one of my favorite soapmaking book authors. She is the owner of one of the largest businesses of it's kind. She has shared her knowledge over the years with others who would like to make soap via her many books on the market. Those books are the how-to's. This one, by the author's own admission is a ""how-can"".It was interesting but not an essential book for either the hobby or professional soap maker's library."
4,Good Basic Information,Definately worth reading! This book offers alot of valuable insight from someone who has worked her way through all aspects of this business. Offers lots of inspiring ideas to help you get your business off the ground. It helped me!
3,This one grows on you,"I was a bit disappointed at first, as I was looking for more of a 1-2-3 approach. But I picked the book up again a couple of days later, and found lots of useful information in it. It still wasn't exactly what I was looking for, but well written and informative nonetheless."
2,A How To???,"Rather than receiving some solid business advice throughout the entire book about how to set up and start an herbal body care business, the entire first half of the book is nothing more than the author's peace, love and granola story of reflection and how she started her business and ran it with no phone or modern technology. Then there are a variety of stories from other business owners of how they did their businesses. Very little is said about the actual business side of things. The book is very self serving and seems more like an autobiography than anything."
1,Disappointed,I thought this was supposed to be a book about starting a body care business? It has virtually NO constructive information about the craft and how to see your ideas come fruition. I would lump this into the hundreds of other general how-to books on small business.
1,not very helpful,I found it very difficult to wade through all the fluff to get much business acumen out of this.
4,Simple - Great Price,"I bought this software last year and thought it was pretty good. As someone else mentioned navigation through the software is an area that can be a little annoying, but it is not very hard to use. For the average person (I cannot speak of those with extremely complicated returns) it is more than adequate and much cheaper than taking your taxes to someone to do."
2,Disappointing,"This is another Weird book I can check off my list now, however this one was disappointing. Texas is such a huge state, but most of the material in the book was quite boring and not all that interesting. Many of the tales were ghost related and recorded from a bunch of kids who went to this place or that because of a legend. If I wanted that I would just talk to people and listen to their stories that are completley outrageous and full of tall tales. There was some historical stuff, but very little and what was put there did not seem to be researched all that well. It also seemed like they only hit certain areas and said the hell with the rest of the state. It was not all bad, I did enjoy a few of the findings. The cemetery part was pretty cool, LaLorna legend I had heard of but still liked, and the Museum of funeral history is something I would love to visit."
3,Sensationalist...not a great inducement to visit Texas (for me anyway),"A bit ""sensationalist"". Doesn't encourage me any more than before to visit Texas. Generally all myths and legends (woohoo ghosts) plus some man-made cheap, tacky stuff. Back to Yellowstone for me."
2,Not as good as weird virginia,We bought this book upon finding out we were noving to Texas. We had the Weird Virginia and loved learning the interesting tales about our home state. I was very disappointed with the Texas book and feel that it could better be called Texas Ghouls and Gore. The book seems to focus just on ghostly or macabre stories and I can only take so much of that in one book.
3,Enjoyable,This book was fun to read. It won't be easy to find stories you haven't heard before about any places you have lived in TX. So if you moved around a few times be wary of some repeat information. We were also dismayed that there isn't more information on getting to some of these places. Small maps would have been helpful to anyone planning a roadtrip. Overall a good effort. I look forward to more Weird States!
5,Great Time,"I saw this book at the Science Museum in Houston. It has some very interesting and somewhat eerie stories to tell about Texas like the Munster Mansion located in a suburb of Waxahachie,Texas or the Kettle House located in along the Galveston shores. This book is worth purchasing."
1,Gail -- is alive and well the author is wrong,"As another poster commented, Gail is not an abandoned town and there are no school ruins. In fact, I was there today visiting my parents. My Grandfather use to own and run the Texaco station in the town before he retired and the school is still very much alive. The author must have invented the story to improve sales. Maybe he thought that since it was such a small town that no one from it would ever read his drivel. Well you can be certain that at least one household from there won't be buying and reading it. Even if there was someway to explain this imagined story from being passed off as related to actual events, the rest of the book's stories are ruined as you expect folklore to somehow be tied to actual places and events. Saying that a town no longer remains that clearly is still around wouldn't be folklore--it would simply be a lie."
4,Good read,"Although the story had some minor technical errors, Joni Rodgers' ability to draw the reader into her characters' lives overshadowed those errors. Her story contains well-written characters with depth and a sense of history. You might not always agree with her characters' actions, but you understood them. Tulsa reminded me of Janis Joplin, a talented woman who couldn't see beyond her own insecurities and `ugly duckling' image to recognize her own talent and beauty. Mac has his own scars from a troubled childhood and traumatic military career. These two damaged people struggle to find a relationship, battling against their histories and sometimes family and friends. Kept me up late at night reading."
3,Started Out Well,"At first, the story was holding my interest, it was well written and seemed to be about a young woman's struggle to find an identity after the death of her mother. But at some point it just took a weird turn and scattered off into several different directions. I had to make myself finish it, from about the halfway mark, because I felt that having gotten that far, I should find out what happened.It just felt like the author wanted to cover too many different topics in one book. Sometimes I felt like I just had no idea what was happening because it jumped around so much. Overall, it wasn't a bad read, but it could have been a more cohesive and smoother story if it had concentrated on attempting to make one solid point rather than making several."
1,Horrible,"Horrible may just be to mild a description of what I thought of this book and I am not normally this harsh. I desperately tried to get through chapter 3 but couldn't torture myself any further. It was bad enough forcing myself through the first two chapters. It just ran on and on, hard to follow, just seemed to be a lot of rambling on to me."
4,Fine beginners book but rather sketchy,"I think a better book is the Complete Guide to Quiltingby Better Homes and Gardens though this book does take the nod on just getting you going and giving you some very easy and basic projects. The problem is nothing is very deep and there is a lot of information (handpiecing vs machine piecing) that is just not remarked upon.The book heavily concentrates on piecework and not quilting btw, which may be a shock to someone just picking this up and not viewing it thoroughly. It does though go thru the various block types including circular and applique up to advanced issues.Colour placement is also sketchy with a nod to the waterfall method of colour placement (dark outsides going to very light centres) but really very little on colour harmony and triadic usage. But the projects are very very nice but I don't think you use this book solely and make a good first quilt."
5,Great starter book,I love this quilt book. It has a variety of projects that are great beginner projects. Beautiful ideas and patterns.
1,Couldn't finish it,"I quite enjoyed the first novel of the series, Angel Fire. The second, The Darkness Gathered, ""jumped the shark"", as the saying goes: an impossible plot being by a good storyteller. I think Ms. Miscione/Unger is a very talented writer -- the words and paragraphs are well-crafted -- but the plots and situations were too much for me. After reading it off-an-on for several weeks (I usually finish a fiction book in a day or two), I picked it up this morning, started reading again, and just gave up, after having ploughed through two-thirds of the book. I think many people will enjoy the book, but I'd suggest using the second book of the series as an indicator. If you liked it, then you'll like this one. If not, then not."
4,A few minor thoughts.,"There can be no doubt that this is one of the greatest novels of all time. It envelopes you very quickly and leaves you changed, if only for a while. I would only point out two disappointments.I found Tolstoy's philosophy boring and rather like a wet blanket, especially in the end.Nearly all of the characters in the story are detestable, selfish human beings. Few learn anything meaningful from this traumatic struggle. The few that do display consistent, redeeming, qualities are generally shafted. Such is life, I understand, but still it disturbed me."
2,Missing the Flavor,"Although a new translation, Briggs has used British English and has Russian Soldiers using words like ""mate"" and ""bloke."" Almost as bad as Constance Garrett having Russians say ""bloody this"" and ""bloody that"" and ""By Jove!"" in some of her translations. Maybe the best in English so far, however, unfortunately; the soldiers and characters speak like Brits and not like Russians--a major flaw in my opinion. Misses the flavor of 19th Century Russia. If possible I would recommend waiting for the Pevear and Volokhonsky translation...(hopefully they make one)"
4,Great Performance; Production could be better,"Finally Bad Religion puts out a North American DVD with recent concert footage. Its only fitting seeing as how the band has been around for what -- 20+ years? The song selection is great, with many tunes pulled from their great catalog. The performances are top notch. (Although Greg is a LITTLE shaky in the first track, he quickly settles in.) My only beef is this: with 3 guitarists in the band, the guitars sound kinda low in the mix. 3 gits SHOULD be a wall of sound, but its not. (I guess they didnt want to bury the vocal, but still...) Also the actual recording LEVEL could be higher. I had to really crank the sound on my tv to really hear it loud, when it should be lound around 15 or so not 25. Also why not put EVERY music video on the DVD? I havent watched the interviews yet, but it IS worth the price for the show. Im being somewhat nitpicky here, but the footage is great, and this Disc is highly recommended."
5,Great DVD,Nicely-shot footage with a good set-list. Interviews intersperced between the songs. As much BR as you could hope for on a single DVD.Recommended.
4,Massey Ferguson Tractor,"I bought this tractor for my 3 yr old grandson. He loves it. It is plastic and might not hold up to heavy digging or hauling, but over all a great tractor!"
1,Size listed is WRONG,"My husband and I order the matching pair of costumes 2 sizes larger than we needed but when we tried them on - neither of us could even get them over our chest! We sent them back right away and now I have to deal with figuring out what we're going to be for Halloween AND returning all the ""gear"" we bought to go along with the costumes."
2,Not convincing. . .,"As a clergyman involved in the Charismatic movement, but also grounded in traditional theological methods, I did not find this book convincing. In my opinion, (and personal experience) Welker's emphasis on freedom in the Spirit can and has led to abuses in the name of that freedom. In the last 50 years, many things in the Church have been justified in the name of ""freedom in the Spirit"" -- a number of which have been nothing more than exercises in self-justification.I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this book."
2,Only a fair movie,"My daughter (10) had asked to purchase this after viewing it at a friend's house, but she has only watched it once. Many, many better movies for children available for purchase."
4,Memory Lane,I ordered this CD along with March to Cadence with the US Amy Airborne and Run to Cadence with Army Rangers. I served in the military for four years some time ago. I had forgotten the many cadence calls. I bought it because I have taken up running again and I was trying to remember some of the calls. It is great and was fun to listen to and remember Basic Training and even PT in general.I would have liked to heard some more calls from different training sites. Each unit is a little different. I hope they come out with more.
3,It does the job,I am currently in college but I am planning on joining the Army Airborne after graduation. I use this cd while I work out and go for runs. I already have the US Army Rangers CD and wanted another choice.This cd isn't as well produced as the Ranger CD I have. The Cadences don't flow together well. During one part of the cd you can hear the guys on the tape laughing during cadence. I don't really care about that but I thought I'd mention it.This CD gets the job done and helps motivate me so I gave it a 3 out of 5. The rough transitions might bother you more than me though. I suggest buying the Ranger's Cadence because the cd is well put together.Hooah Airborne!!!
4,Does it's job,"Put it on my MP3 player for running. It did the job, keeping me at a steady pace. I highly recommend it. It was motivating and often funny. What would be my ideal? Cadence set to motivating music with a steady pace and no dips or pauses."
5,Wonderful Western!,"This was in my opinion the best DrQuinn-book ever! I couldn't stop reading it, I wanted to know what was going to happen! I'm a fan of the TV-show, so I really could ""see"" the persons in the book, their expressions etc.. GREAT BOOK!!! READ IT!!!"
1,"Some cute scenes, but otherwise very mediocre writing","Ms. Warfield is at her best when she writes about everyday and home life in Colorado Springs, particularly among the more beloved characters like Michaela and Sully. Overall, however, the plotting is very lame, essentially being a paste-up of tiresome ""old saw"" story lines and scenes from the TV episodes. Attempts to stash all the TV characters in the book result in sprawling sideplots that are very tiresome and go nowhere (Dorothys' arthritis) or just plain stupid (Brian and the prostitutes). One final comment: the Dr. Quinn books need some serious editing. I found alot of redundancies and at least one repeated sentence."
3,Cleopatra is Masterpiece - others in collection have not aged well,Mainly bought this collection because of Cleopatra - which is a 5 star masterpiece - and deserves a review on its own - the other movies all share the common issues related to their release date:1. They are black&white; + not wide format2. There is so much dialogue and not enough action3. All filming is done in studios & you can tellAll in all - if you love Cleopatra and want to check out more movies from that era - this is a good choice
3,Cecil B. DeMille Collection,"most of the movies in this collection where good and one i didn't like at all. it was a romance movie and i don't like those movies. I bought these movies because of the movie Cleopatra but it wasn't the movie i wanted, my mastake. you live and learn form youe mastakes."
1,All I want is Cleopatra!,"My shopping cart contains the Elizabeth Taylor version of Cleopatra, priced at $14.99. I wanted to add the Claudette Colbert version at a similar price. Unfortunately, the only DVD available is this damned ridiculously overpriced collection which would force me to buy four movies I don't want to get the one that I do. Well, I ain't gonna do it! Ever!"
3,"OK, but where are the extras?","All us film buffs want to see more of these kind of titles finally coming out on DVD, but I'm flabbergasted that they're putting out these interesting but rather obscure films without any extras.Sales figures show that classic titles sell surprisingly well when they are accompanied by background documentaries and commentary tracks. DeMille isn't exactly a household name nowadays, and this series cries out for a better release. Shame on Universal!"
4,Decent Boxed Set,"These movies are good,but they don`t really represent the best of DeMilles work.Films like The Ten Commandments (1923)and the remake in 1956,The King of Kings (1928)Samson and Delilah(1949)and The greatest Show on Earth(1950)are Demilles best in my opinion.Still these movies contain the elements that make his movies fun to watch;such as lavish costumes,action,battle scenes and plenty of drama.I would recommend this set to any Demille fan."
4,missing disc makes a void in collection.,"The films and quality are more than pretty good, however, on arrival I found one of the discs (Four frightened People)to be missing from the nicely presented package.The collection arrived completely sealed in plastic wrap so it seems to me that there may of been a malfunction at the manufacturing site and the packing machine may have missed a step.Although of some concern it it is not a major catastrophe and I can live with it.These things happen."
4,A gentle Read,I have read half of the book in just two days. It is a great read. I felt like I could relate to a lot of what was being said. The tales are of everyday women in everyday situations. It is comfortable to know that others out there feel as you do during any stage of your life.
4,brother Morse,"a very good show from the brother of Neal.different than Spock's Beard , but just as creativenice to add to jazz-fusion collection"
3,Cheese at its best!,"This definitely is one of the cheesiest made-for-TV suspense/horror movies, but I absolutely love it. That's probably because it was filmed in my hometown of Lake Havasu City, Arizona, when I was in the 5th grade, and one of the few things that has made Havasu famous for something other than out-of-control Spring Break-ers. Plus, David Hasselhoff still had a modicum of respectability in 1985."
3,More Information,"This site does not include enough info about which models of the Radio Flyer this seat fits. It fits model #s 31, 89, 98, 90 and 18. Unfortunately, you will have to visit the Radio Flyer web-site to find out more info about this seat and other wagons. The site is www.redwagons.com. Good luck!"
5,Wagon seat is great!!!,"My son loved the wagon seat! We took it to the zoo and all the other parents asked where we got it. We didn't have any problems latching the seat onto the wagon. It fit fine and we didn't have to adjust the strap at all. The seat is very safe and allows my son to comfortable ride and recline in his wagon. This seat is definitely worth the price. If you're buying a wagon, you need this seat."
1,SAFETY FACTOR FOR WAGON SEAT,"THE WAGON SEAT IS DURABLE AND COMFORTABLE. HOWEVER, THE BELT PROVIDED TO SECURE THE SEAT TO THE WAGON IS TOO SHORT AND CANNOT BE LATCHED UNDER THE WAGON TO APPROPRIATELY SECURE THE SEAT FOR SAFETY PURPOSES. CONSEQUENTLY, I AM SEEKING AN EXTENSION FOR THE BELT. I SHOULD NOT NEED TO SEEK A MEANS TO REMEDY A FLAW IN THE MANUFACTURER'S PRODUCT AT MY EXPENSE."
3,Wagon Seat,"Once again, I'm dissatisfied with this purchase...Your website said this seat would fit all Radio Flyer Wagons...It does not fit the ATW Cargo Wagon. Both this item and the pad set I bought through Amazon are absolutely useless for the wagon Ipurchased from you. Therefore, I probably will not use Amazonfor future purchases."
3,"May be a BakFlip, may not be...","This may be a BakFlip product but it comes labeled, boxed and logoed as a ""Ford Custom Accessory"". It is also a 4 panel cover not the 3 panel that is shown in the picture. Installation was simple enough but one might want to watch the video on BakFlips site for a good overview. I had to remove the diamond plate bed rails that were on the truck to fit the cover properly. If you have aftermarket bedrails you may have to do the same. It also came with a thoroughly squashed and deformed piece of foam tape that only said to use on bed rail if you don't have a bed liner. It was too damaged to use so I guess I'll be making a trip to the hardwar store for an equivalent replacement. All in all seems like a good product but I can't give it more than 3 stars because of the Ford label and the 4 vs. 3 panel situation. Perhaps after I've used it for awhile I'll update the review."
2,"Quality, but not quality","Product was great for about 3 months, then the side tighteners started ripping apart, and after about 10 months, the crotch seam is breaking open. Do not buy unless you plan to grow out of these."
2,Every business needs an angel? How about some cash as well?,An anachronistic view of the tech bubble circa late '90s. Dated and stale. Belongs in the Smithsonian Museum of American History.Does not address the current dismal economic reality of the Angel system.
1,Not a relastic take for investors,"I have read several angel books as well as having spent 5 years running a large fund in the Valley, and I just don't feel that Cal and John have their views correct. The investment world has changed and those who can be to the point and have a good idea with good management have a shot. However, I hope for these folks that Cal and John are not on the other side of the table evaluating."
5,john hagees songs,i have not seen a video so i cant say. i want to view some of his songs and cornerstone ministry songs.
2,Flaws abound,"I've had this collection for well over a year now... I can count to 100 in chinese, because I bought a book that has the numbers listed. I can say hello, goodbye and that I'm feeling okay or not okay. (Freaks my dog out when I go ""Wo Bu Haoooooooooo!"" really loudly)But other than that, I really haven't picked up much.I'm a visual person. I need the support of written texts. I need to hear it, see it and write it like you would do in a college spanish class. I need to be able to interact and put the stuff to practical use, otherwise it just doesn't resonate with me.For a person looking to reinforce their current level of chinese, this might work out for you...but I agree this is NOT for the true beginner."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"Don't waste your money. You'll never learn any Chinese using these CDs. There is no rhyme or reason to their system. The CDs contain random Chinese vocabulary words which are rattled off by the speaker along with the English translation. At the end of the 1st CD, I only knew how to say ""mother, father, and older brother,"" and I'm bilingual Eng/Spn. There was no conversation on the 1st CD & I suspect the 2nd wont be much different, though I wont waste my time listening to it. You'll learn more chinese at your local Chinese restaurant than you'll ever learn from this CD."
3,slooow but sweet,This is part of a set of dramas by the same director. There is also Autumn in my heart which also stars Song Seung-Heon and Winter Sonata which is the most popular out of the three. They are not connected in story but they share fabulous cinematography! the music is great. Only thing is be prepared for a far-fetched storyline that is almost expected of Korean MELO-Dramas...and for exaggerated repetitive moments! I still enjoyed it because I accepted that it's just the k-drama style. First timers...might find it corny and very slow! Don't say you weren't warned.
4,How to Deal With Gravity,"Gravity is the most influencial force in our lives. Eric Franklin's Dynamic Alignment Through Imagery deals how to move in the gravity field.I am not a professial dancer. But I am approaching walking the 4.0 minute mile using body images in Franklin's book as a guide for good alignment. This imagery that moves your body parts better keeps your interest. It is fun. Right now I am working on hip motions images.How much do I like it? I bought five copies to give to my children so they could share good alignment with my grandchildren. So, they all will know how to deal with and make peace with gravity."
5,book review,"There was nothing wrong with this product. My daughter dropped the class in college that required this book; therefore, she didn't need the book any longer."
2,Not a safety bag.,"I bought this bag two months ago for my son's 38"" Acoustic guitar. it fits the guitar perfectly with just enough room.Bag color is blue,But It doesn't have any cushion in side the bag to protect the guitar."
1,Disappointing,"I purchased the First Act Discovery guitar at a Target store. I assumed the guitar would fit since I didn't notice any other size ""First Act"" guitars. I was terribly disappointed that the case was too small. The case was approximately 3 inches too short. I was, however, a bit happy to return it as the fabric was very thin. It would not have provided enough protection from being bumped here & there as my 6 year old tranports it to & from her music classes."
2,Beware! This case is NOT for all First Act guitars!,"I put the First Act guitar for students on my daughter's wish list & since the case was linked to it, I added the guitar case also. My daughter got the guitar & case for this past Chanukah (2007). Both are great products. The case is inexpensive enough & would have been just fine except for one problem. Nowhere in the guitar case description does it mention which of the First Act guitars it fits. Do not add this to your wish list or purchase it unless you want to take the time to return it when the case doesn't fit the guitar you purchased. Basically, the description on the case isn't good enough."
3,EmmetMD,"I thought this book was moderately helpful. I'm about to start my residency in OB-Gyn and this book offered a few helpful hints. Most of it seemed to be common sense, however. If you've made it through med school, you'll probably already know most of the information. Some of the chapters about medicine being so male dominated seemed a little out of date."
1,Calendar Creator 4 from Learning Company,Despite the program's low price it is not worth the cost in frustration. For some reason this program often renders event files unreadable. The problem is that there is no way to recover the entries and one has to start over. After suffering from this inumerable times I have discarded the program.
1,Hate it now,"I used to love this program. I used to use this for many different schedules. It will not run on my Win2000 or XP machines these days. It does not offer an error message, so I have no idea what the problem is or how to fix it."
3,It's only one diaper cover!,"I haven't used this yet, but I was disappointed to find out that even though they list it as ""diaper covers"", plural, there is only one cover for the price. I also purchased the All In One diapers by Kushies in a 5 pack, which came out to about $10 per diaper - and the cover, diaper and liner are all included!"
3,Rhino drops the ball again!,"It's about time someone put out an updated Foghat collection. Unfortunately, this one is not quite perfect. I deduct one star for the use of many single edits, especially on ""Slow Ride"" and ""Fool For The City."" Come on Rhino, you could've included both versions of each song! Each disc is only about an hour long. I also minus a star because the live version of ""I Just Want To Make Love To You"" is not included, even though that was a bigger chart hit than the original. Once again, why not just include both? On the plus side, this set does offer a nice sampling of each of Foghat's albums from 1972-1983 & the songs have been remastered. Also, you can find this for a really good price if you look around. So despite some flaws, this is still a pretty decent anthology."
4,redvette79,This product is very easy to work with and to put together.All instructions are very good and easy to understand. the packing is also quite good!!!
1,This $20 keyboard cost me $2000 NO STAR,"I bought this keyboard from a retail store not Amazon, anyway I was assured that it was compatable with any system. I had a 3 year old Compaq running on Windows 98. All was fine until I hit the Calculator key on the keyboard and an error message appeared saying that the system was disabled.After $300 worth of diagnoisis a technician informed me that the Mircosoft keyboard fried the mother board and that I may as well purchase a new computor, another $1500. There will be another $200-300 worth of incedental expense, needless to say I am not happy.About 10 days ago I sent an email to Micrsoft merely asking for an explanation not restitution and I have not heard back.DO NOT BUY THIS KEYBOARD"
1,Keys Wear Out Quickly,"I have this keyboard, and I was here looking for a new one because the one I have is wearing out. If you use certain keys a lot, for instance the control key for your keyboard shortcuts, the keys wear out really fast and they start sticking. My control key only lasted 5 months, (I bought it 5 months ago) and now I have to push it really hard to get it to respond, and it sticks horribly."
2,Do Not Buy This Keyboard thinking it's USB,"i bought this k/b thinking it was USB but it's not. If u look in the technical spec and not the reviews, it says that the keyboard is PS/2 so Dont be foul by all the review stating that the keyboard is USB. While the keyboard is fine and nothing special, if i known it was PS/2 i would have bought something else like the internet pro.on another note, the extra button are not customizable and the choices for the buttons arent the best since the useful ones can be accomplished by a keyboard shortcut and the non-useful ones just arent useful."
3,too small,"bought as a gift for my boyfriend, and was sad to find out it was a lot smaller than i thought it would be"
4,Freshwater Ecoregions of North America: A Conservation Assessment,"Contains good general background information all in one reference. Useful for starting point investigations of watersheds and/or writing BEs, BAs EISs and etc."
4,Beautifully illustrated,"The color photographs in this book make it a winner for anyone who is learning to tie knots-- it's easy to see where everything is supposed to go. The knots are broken down by type-- stopper knots, hitches, etc., with several of each type. The directions are clear and easy to follow, and there are explanations of why you might choose to use each knot.The only downside is that some of the detailed photos are a bit small, though they're still fairly easy to follow."
4,Shakira Oral Fixation Tour Blu-ray,Is a nice concert over all but I think there is a room for improvement.
5,Awesome!,It's everything I was hoping it would be. Shakira puts in a dazzling performance in Miami. The DVD is very entertaining.
5,Shakira Rules!!!,I was at both of the concerts at Madison Square Garden. No one compares to Shakira. My favorite singer of all time in all the world. I can't wait to get this dvd in my hands. I love when she sings Whenever Wherever and goes into the audience. It is madness!! She also blew me a kiss when she sang Underneath Your Clothes. Though she is an international star she remains humble and down to earth and has dedicated much of her time and effort to helping others. Que viva Shakira!
3,Just good,"Concert was good because it had Wyclef and Alejandro singing with Shakira. Of course Shakira is a great singer (she actually sings) and her concerts are awesome but I don't know why this DVD just didn't cut it for me. I guess because overtime Shakira's songs don't have the same appeal as the old ones had or if it's the way she now sings that makes it hard to understand what she is saying. Overall concert was good, but extras made the purchase a little more worthile. If you are a fan buy it otherwise it's not really worth it."
4,Great Video - DD 5.1 Needs Improvement,"This is one of the best blu-ray DVD I have. The concert, show, song everything is awesome. Picture was phenomenal. The 2channel LPCM uncompressed audio is excellent. However, the Dolby Digital 5.1 track is inadequate at best. The DD 5.1 track often dropped off the side vocals (like in hips don't lie). So if you have DD 5.1 receiver than you may not fully enjoy the 5.1 channel track. That's my only gripe about this Blu-Ray DVD."
4,Shakira is great! But the show is red!,Great musicsGreat sound (PCM 5.1)Great performance (shakira's)Good video... (the quality is great but the producers of the show... hum... well.. they did everything red most of the time. I didn't like it)
1,Before You Buy,"When I first bought this Great White compilation, my only reason to get this was because I wanted to up my update from ""Best Of Great White : 1986-1992"". I liked the idea that ""Mista Bone"", ""Lady Red Light"" and at the time from their new '99 album ""Rollin' Stoned"" were on this compilation. Well after i bought it, I soon realized that all of the old tracks were remixed (re-recorded for that matter), not just the drums, the guitars, the keyboards, the bass guitar and yes even the singing. Just stick to older best of comps and the albums. Great White pulled a fast one on me. The first example, listen to the drumming, it doesn't have a 80's bassy drum snare sound to it anymore. The sound is not digitally remastered, the reason why it sounds so clear like some mentioned before, well it's called re-recording, and for laughs let's package it like ""best of"". Whatever!"
4,Rock on!,"I firmly believe that Great White is one of the best rock and roll bands out there. With sexy grooves, tribal rhythms, and solid vocals, Great White offers music that you can truly feel in your soul. Songs like ""Call It Rock and Roll"", ""Mista Bone"", and ""Rock Me"" palpitate with Jack Russell's awesome vocals and an ardent pulse from guitarist Mark Kendall.This album offers an excellent taste of some of Great White's best efforts, some re-done and some live. I would have liked to have seen ""Big Goodbye"" and ""Desert Moon"" on the album, but the songs that are included are of the best.I love Great White. Always have, and always will."
5,Best of the Best,"Though I am well aware of the legions of people who found no use or entertainment in the bands of the last 80's and early 90's, I buck their condescending looks and smile as I turn it up. If you were/are a fan of Great White, this is a great album. I don't listen to GW more than once every six months or so, but with a collection this thorough, I'd be more likely to throw it in the disc player and go than shuffle through the four discs I have trying to find these very songs. I say go for it and enjoy!"
2,Correction to the March 2nd 2002 review,Rollin' Stoned isn't new for this album. It was on 1999's Can't Get There from Here.I don't really understand the point of this album.
3,"Richie's Build'in Houses, Bill's the President","""Rollin Stoned"" could have been the theme song of the Clinton presidency, if only this group could have gotten itself played at times other than 3:00 a.m. when even Bill was probably passed out, or too distracted on the phone. It's a hauntingly accurate reprise of the 1970's--that formative phase of things in Arkansas. I'm disconcerted that this band was apparently left out of the ""Joe Dirt"" soundtrack. Go figure."
2,Calendar Creator 5.0,"For children's educational software, The Learning Company can't be beat. For productivity software, look elsewhere. While the file saving is a vast improvement over Version 4, the user interface is not anymore helpful. If you have the time and tolerance, it's a good deal. If you need to get the job done quickly, try another calendar."
2,Not as good as Softkey versions,"I needed an update for Calendar Creator 4 and bought version 10. Mistake! I've since bought version 5 to try getting back some of the lost functionality that version 4 had, but no luck. I had to jump through some hoops, including keeping a computer with Windows 98, to continue using version 4. Specifically, versions 5 and up have no provision to make event graphics small so multiple events on a given day will both print. Why Broderbund did this, I don't understand, but for my purposes, they ruined the product. I've had a number of Broderbund products and it's readily apparent they don't care if the product serves its purpose or not. I won't buy their stuff again."
1,BAD MOTOR,The short warranty on this motor was a good idea from Bosch perspective. This motor can not handle hardwood very well. It burned up three weeks after the warranty expired. Bosch couldn't care less. Buy something else.
2,motor burned out-used infrequently,"Very disappointed in the durability of this product! The motor burned out after infrequent use. When I took the motor to a Bosch authorized repair shop I was advised that ""they've had A LOT of problems with this saw"". The repair man siad he would get the price for the parts but warned that it would be approximately half the cost of a new saw... and then I would still have a saw that is known to have serious problems. This saw was not worth the money I spent. There are other portable table saws that hold up much better. Do yourself a favor and spend some time reading reviews before you purchase!"
3,Not for me,"This is an excellent saw and probably the best in its category but I outgrew it quickly and had to upgrade. Basically, if you need a table saw with mobility, this is the one to get. As for me, I started out doing remodelling projects on the house and it was great to be able to easily move it out in the yard to do all my cuts. however, i'm now getting into woodworking and although it can probably do the job, I find i need a bit more heft and size. If you are like my situation, opt for a contractor saw from the start. I will just cost a little more but you will be set. 3 stars due to the high cost. for just a little more money you can have a much better saw & much better fence. the only advantage to this saw is the small size and mobility."
4,Changing Blades,"This is a great portable saw for taking along to remodel jobsites, especially when you have to set up shop and break down everyday. It's accurate enough to do site-built cabinets with acceptable tolerances. The only problem I have, as do so many others who have this saw, is with blade changes. I finally took the blade cover off, pulled out my Rotozip, and whacked off the offending portion of the blade guard just enough to be able to clear the blade, and reinstalled the blade cover. Works like a charm, and no more frustrations. And it doesn't throw that much more saw dust around than before. I usually attach an 8-gal. shop vac to pick up most of the dust on jobsites. It does a good enough job and keeps my customers happy when they don't see all that dust blowing all over the place."
1,david,"The simple fragil bracket which holds the rod to adjust the height of the saw blabe will eventually crack and fail, this is due to poor engineering. It is just like having a mansion with a little door latch for security."
3,tools and hardware,I wish to know that machines you supply can work with 220 volts AC. will you please clear my doubt.
3,4.4 horsepower? I don't think so.,"If one horsepower is about 750 watts at 100% efficiency, then how can a 15 amp saw produce anything more than about two horsepower?"
3,Durability problems..,"We bought this saw shortly after it came to market and loved it. After about 1 year, we started having trouble raising and lowering the blade. We would have to reach up underneath and lift the motor while turning the crank. A few months later, the motor burned out, and now the saw has been in the repair shop for close to two months. BO'd parts etc.I can't compare this saw to others, nor would I say to _not_ buy it, but just be prepared for the eventual downtime."
2,Durability issue- bad stuff,"Would have rated this saw 5 stars except for a major issue with durability.The bushings that travel along the vertical adjustment rails are made of aluminum and wear out in very short order. The result is binding when attempting to raise the blade. Forcing the matter will result in breaking the assembly that raises the blade.Our local tool repair guy sees two or three of these a week and says some have come back 2 or 3 times. Bosch has warranteed these repairs but has not improved the faulty part or issued a recall that we are aware of. This is pretty disappointing coming from a company as respectable as Bosch.Really, this WOULD be a primo saw if it weren't for the fact it breaks down regularly. If you don't require reliability this saw is fantastic!"
2,unhappy customer,I bought the 10 inch table saw 18 months ago and have used it very little on jobs around the house -- I ripped 6 2X4 and the motor burnt out -- I feel that the motor is not of very good quality!!!!
4,"Good Introduction, Broad Topic Coverage","As someone relatively new to the telephony field, this book was a good introduction to a variety of topics. Since it is based on a managerial point-of-view, the topics are not highly detailed or technical, but contain enough information to understand what the various components are, and how they interact. This is not the only book that I would buy to understand issues in telephony, but served as a good general-purpose introduction. A valuable book to those new to telephony concepts. Also contains many real-world case studies, enhancing its value to those in a managerial role seeking to utilize or understand this technology."
2,Placemat image might be inadvertently consumed,"No doubt Crocodile Creek does a great job with creating engaging product visuals. I purchased these in various designs for use with my under-5 kids. With normal use, the images lasted only a few days before areas started to rub away. For example, I missed a Cheerio when wiping down the mats after breakfast. When I went back to clean it later, the image scraped off in a circle with the ""o."" Easy to see how a curious child would just as easily eat that Cheerio with printing attached. I'm not one who gets overly worked up about all-natural products, but it makes me mad to see these in stores when the manufacturer is being so irresponsible. Let's assume the printing is food-safe. Even then, why do they only last a few uses? They are not marketed as disposable."
1,"Great Idea, but poor product. Potentially dangerous.","My nephew had this exact placemat, and the ink comes off every time we wipe it. (whether we use Simple Green, water, or wiping off orange juice) No one feels comfortable letting a toddler eat food off a placemat that has its paint coming off. Who knows what's in the paint? The educational value is great, though - they just need to find a better way to manufacture a child's product!"
3,It's OK not great but OK,"The navy cadences are few and 14. Easy run (navy) is terrible. The marine corps probably has one of the best cadence genres and it's not well displayed. I have yet to find well choriagraphed cadences. I would like to find one with full songs and not just bits and pieces. like the super heros cadence with superman, aqua man, ..... or the full version of ""momma got some big ole draws.......ding dong"" or Marine corps colors. So many to go on."
5,another superb installment,"I'll freely admit that this is one of my all-time favorite mystery series. Sharan Newman has the gift of creating wonderfully memorable characters and placing them in a vividly realized setting. When I read her books, I feel myself walking through the streets of mid-twelfth-century Paris with Catherine and Edgar. This latest book is a superb addition to the series. Catherine, Edgar, and their family return to Paris from a long sojourn in Germany (chronicled in THE DIFFICULT SAINT) to find a dead body in their Paris house. Who was he? and how did his body come to be left in their house? The answers to these questions prove fascinating, as usual, while Newman continues to unfold the story of her major characters. This book, like the others in the series, is richly textured, not only in the historical details, but in the emotional lives of the characters. Newman is a fine historian, as always, but she's a stunning storyteller as well."
3,Not Your Average Thriller,"This was definitely a very well-written murder mystery - more educated-sounding than many (perhaps because the writer is a lawyer). All in all, I thought it was pretty fun, pretty exciting, with a little bit of a twist at the end. Honestly, it was the overly ambiguous ending coupled with its general implausibility that spoiled the book a bit for me. But I think I would still read another by this author just for his writing style alone - I just hope that the plot is handled with more finesse in the future!"
5,st louis' finest,"2G has done it again, with the release of the new album, We Say Dirty in stores soon, this maxi single is soon to be considered a CLASSIC! This was the 1st release under AFFILIATED MUSIC GROUP, but now the album is ready to drop, this is an Independent label, but the world will soon know bout 2G soon enuf!"
1,Not my taste,The flavor of Sylvia's Country Gravy Mix is not my taste. The product is bland and unappealing. I personally do not recommend it.
1,This product likely includes MSG!,"Please note, that Disodium Inosinate & Guanylate, which are clearly stated as included ingredients, are indicators of the presence of MSG! Here is a quote from Truth in labeling, ""Disodium guanylate and disodium inosinate do not contain MSG, but work synergistically with free glutamic acid. When disodium guanylate and disodium inosinate are found on a food label, consumers can be fairly certain that the labeled product contains some hidden processed free glutamic acid (MSG). Disodium guanylate and disodium inosinate are relatively expensive food additives that would not be cost effective if they were not used in the presence of MSG."""
1,the ingredient list is not correct,"When they say no MSG, it's a lie. The package I received clearly said it contained autolyzed yeast extract, which in fact has msg. The ingredients they list aren't the same as what is on the package. I would never have bought this item if I had seen that."
2,"not the worst, but still dont waste your time","The case cover intro for this movie certainly sounds appealing, but unfortunately that intro fails to convey just how boring this film is. I will say, to its benefit, the movie isn't painful to watch (which, perhaps is a sad testament to the quality of films i've been watching lately). While its lower budget, the production values are high enough that you're not distracted by the budget. Also, the acting is fine and generally believable. Where it fails is the story - its simply very slow and not engaging. It takes a long time before there is any action, and the sequences leading up to it are boring with uninspired dialogue. If you're forced to watch this, it won't be the worst 1.5 hr of your life, but I'd encourage you to not necessarily seek this one out."
3,Not Bad!!!,"I thought this was pretty good. A masked serial killer targets convenience stores and kills them on camera. When there is a $500,000 the workers at a liquor store in L.A. begin to talk about what they would do to him. Unfortunately, the killer overheard, and decides to come back at night to crash their poker party. He slowly begins killing them in the way that the workers described. I'd probably recommend CORNERED!!!"
5,Theres no shine like mother's indeed...,"It's made for wheels, but I didn't use for those. I used it on my aluminium part for my project. The result were very shiny indeed."
3,"Forget the dogs, Apologize to us","Creative. Unique. Great concept. Quirky characters. So why did this novel only get three stars? Because (while it had an ending) I didn't finish this book with feeling any resolve. There are too many things that keep you wondering. I know some authors go for the enlightening ambiguouity, but not this novel. It just felt like Coomer was finishing up but then all of a sudden he ran out of paper. Three quarters through the book I gave myself a pat on the back for thinking ""Oh! Apologizing to dogs is symbolic of forgiving and forgetting the wrongdoings in your life. (for aren't we all at times mangey strays?)"" Well don't give them credit, because you'll never find out what anyone thinks of anyone else in the end. And that was disappointing. Plus certain things and behaviors (i.e. the bone sucking thing) were just to wierd to grasp.At least it's entertaining, if you can get past the first few pages of bone sucking."
3,DAY TO DAY HAPPENINGS ON WORTH ROW,"Although the characters were quirky and a bit eccentric, I just couldn't get into the day to day activities of the 12 homes/storefronts that remain on Worth Row. Effie, the 71 year old snoop, keeps a diary of everyone's comings and goings. There are more secrets going on here than on any soap opera on the air today. The fact that this title had the word ""dog"" in it is what drew me to it. Too bad there wasn't more of the dog and less of the other characters."
2,Not great...,"This is a strange, but entertaining book. It was quite funny and very strangely written with different P.O.V.s all over the place. I don't know that I would read another book by this author though everything was well-written. The characters were certainly ridiculous, but I don't know how well it ended - some storylines weren't wrapped up enough. I don't think I would recommend it either. It just didn't seem complete somehow... something was missing."
4,A good read,"From one of my very favorite authors. Not Coomer,s best but an interesting and probably accutate glimpse into village life and times. Seemed to me the dogs were just incidental."
3,Yankee's-eye view of colonial Cuba,"This diary is valuable as a record of the assumptions and, frankly, prejudices of a New England Yankee looking at Cuba in the age of manifest destiny. Dimock assumes that Cuba belongs in the expanding domain of the United States. He speaks of the characteristics of the various racial groups on the island, all of which, he is quite clear, are inferior to his own Anglo-Saxon stock. He enjoys himself in Cuba, but is not a well behaved guest, occasionally staging little confrontations. His attempt to transcribe Spanish words is ludicrous (e.g., ""jorchata"" becomes ""orcharda""). All in all, it's a candid record made without self-consciousness, but it is most useful to someone who already knows a good deal about Cuba. I would give the book a higher grade if it had included some background material, or at least some notes correcting Dimock's bad Spanish."
3,Nice smell but too oily for face,"This has a very pleasent smell but it was too oily to put on my face, which is why I purchased it in the first place. Instead, I use it on my hands which seems to work well."
4,Good Online Plant Experience,"I received two healthy plants that arrived well packed and quickly.Both plants transplanted well to bigger pots and seem to be thriving althoughthe Green Maranta is doing much better than the Red. Not sure why.Overall, I would order plants like these from Amazon again."
1,Dissapointed,"I've grown up with prayer plants, how the leaves close at night. The leaves on the green plant have turned yellow and the red leaf plant has turned brown."
4,Interesting Plants,"Very interesting plants. The Green seemed to thrive better than the Red. Red came with dried leaves, but you can tell the vendor made an effort with packaging ect. Use this in my small office space off living room. Very nice"
3,good reference material,"Well presented information, but some is outdated today.Still would help explain some areas of study that someone looking for a 6 pack or 100 ton master could use."
4,interesting theories,This book was recommended by my daughter. We have discussed parts of it together. The wording is a little tedious but interesting.
4,Quasar Pen Radio,"Pretty cool little radio. A little difficult to tune but locks on to strong statons just fine. Volume control is on the earphone cord so you don't need to take the pen out of your pocket to adjust. Very light, great for the backpack or tackle box."
5,An honest look at war,"""Unembedded"" returns all the emotions to a conflict which has largely been reported from a safe distance. These four photographers bring you into Iraqi neighbourhoods, hospitals and homes to show the devastating short and longer-term effects of ""surgical strikes"". If you want to get a sense of what war really means for men, women and children, turn off the T.V. and spend some time with the people in these photographs."
4,Touching and Real,This is an important book. So little has been disclosed about the terrible damage that Iraq has suffered with the sanctions and two wars. The heroic and talented photography in this well published book is valuable information for anyone who is interested in the harsh reality of the situation that ordinary people in Iraq face today
5,A story of Iraqis under US occupation.,"It shows the heart and soul of Iraqis. It shows what they are going through during the US invasion and occupation. Though shot by mostly US photographers, it shows from the Iraqi standpoint. Some of the pictures are disturbing but after all it is the depiction of war and WAR is not a pretty site.Kudos to the worthy photographers who put their life in danger to show the whole world an unembedded story.I salute you guys!!"
1,UNEMBEDDED,The photos were very interesting. Seeing the sadness of war is very compelling and heart wrenching. The captions are obviously from a Saddam Hussien Sympathizer point of view. I question if the captions are truthful to the photos or just more journalists propaganda. The less than 20 percent of Iraqis that don't want Freedom are captured in the words wriiten. Great photos ...that is about it. If you hate the American and Iraqi Military...you'll love reading the words.
1,Very bad experience,I suggest you are very careful before you buy strings from these guys. I ordered for the 0.11 gauge set (as advertised) and they sent me a 0.9 gauge set. I thought it was my mistake and then went back and checked and i had actually ordered the right thing. i sent them a return request and i only got the mail confirming that i have made a request. no one contacted me from D'addario. Quite disappointing. I suggest you don't order from here. Strings are definitely good but you don't wanna get screwed over for your money. i don't use 0.9's and i don't know what to do with them now.
3,"Not great, but not bad","First I must admit that I really do not like D,Addario strings. The packaging annoys me. Changing strings is always a hassel, because there is no individual packaging. The strings are relatively consistent. They tend to hold up well for a non-coated string. I put these on a 2010 Les Paul Standard Plus, because I could not get the action low enough with 10's. They did the trick. The overall tension and tone made the guitar sing. They do work well....once you get them on!"
5,SELF INSPIRATIONAL,WHAT A WONDERFUL BOOK! IT RELIVES THEIR PAST LIVES AND SHARES THEIR UPS AND DOWNS THAT WE ALL FACE AT ONE TIME OR ANOTHER. IT IS A GREAT ASSET IN MY LIFE TO KNOW THAT EVERYONE IS HUMAN AND EXPERIENCES THE SAME HIGHS AND LOWS AND WITH GOD'S HELP ALWAYS GETS US THROUGH THE TURMOILS THAT LIFE SO OFTEN GIVES US.A GREAT INSPIRATIONAL BOOK!!
2,I Was Confused!,"I purchased this by mistake, by not paying careful attention!What I wanted and expected was the Beatles' Past Masters, Vol. 2!"
5,Cool Program,"A couple years ago during Mothers Day weekend I was at the mall with friends. There was a kiosk of ""Mom's Gang"" tshirts. They were shirts saying moms gang or whatever and little clip art children with names of mom's kids.... I said to myself I could probably make this. Within the next few weeks I bought TShirt Factory. I found clip art kids similar to the mall shirts and made a few myself. It was fun, the shirts came out nice although the picture was not as big as the ones on the mall shirts (only the size of standard transfer paper) The graphics had much to be desired but better than some graphics I have seen. I had to touch up most clip art changing colors etc. If you want to make shirts for fun or gifts this program is cool."
2,Dissapointing,"I bought 3 books by Doc Hauser, however the first parts of the books are essentially the same in each. With regard to the book on fibromyalgia, the topic isn't discussed until chapter 9 - two thirds of the way into the book.On the plus side, the book is well referenced and offers suggestions for tackling this complex disease."
1,Bleh.,This belt was a piece of crap and fell apart shortly after I got it. Don't buy it. It's a waste of money.
2,Get topo maps instead,"This book is more of a travelogue than a guidebook. I was expecting maps, trail lengths, phone numbers for hostels: the kind of things you get in a Lonely Planet or Falcon Books guide. Fayhee's book is a series of stories about his trips to Copper Canyon with a repetitious exhortation to ""get a guide!"" for most of the hikes he lists. If I wanted a guide I wouldn't have bought a guidebook. For anyone comfortable with some degree of self-reliance, go for topo maps and local contacts instead of this book."
5,"When Fayhee says ""impassable"", it is impassable.","Informative and constantly entertaining, this book is an essential guide to visiting a truly magical place. I found the book accurate and useful in trip planning in addition to gaining a basic cultural education. Fayhee's attitude toward exploring an insulated and private culture is inspiring."
2,Covers the ABC's of makeup...,"If you are pretty familiar with the applications of makeup, then this may not be for you. It goes over the basics which I already familiar with. They could have also done a better job blending the makeup on a couple of the models (even though the models applied the makeup themselves). However, there are not many African-American how-to-apply makeup DVD's on the market so I am glad to add this to my collection."
4,The DVD works for my girls. They look great!,"I bought this DVD for my daughters and they loved it. Their skin looks better and they wear makeup like a lady should. My husband who never says anything made a comment on how well the girls look. It may not be for the glamous movie star type that may have a professional do their face anyway, but it's perfect for learning how to care for your skin and look your best at work and out for the evening."
5,Works for puppy and toddler training!,"Liquid alive is fantastic for mold, but works great on carpet after puppy or kid accidents. Completely removes matter and smell. I have used it as a pre-soak for little accidents from potty training, puppy training, and moldy camp shoes!"
1,Didn't Work,"I was disappointed with the quality of this item. It was sent to me, and was defective. It could not be formatted on any media device. Additionally when I complained about the product, I was told there were no more available."
4,SanDisk-Flash memory card-2 GB-microSD,"The disk seems to work fine, but dosn't work in the phone that it was purchased for. I believe that it is too large for the phone to support. It is really hard to get any information about playing any media on the phone unless you purchase the media directly from the the phone plan and not try to transfer stored files that you have already purchased elsewhere. It seems like the information should be a lot more accessible. Oh well, it works fine in my mp4 player. The disk was delivered in a timely manner and had no issues other the the above stated one and that is certainly not the fault of Amazon or anyone else involved in the transaction."
2,"Missing Adapter, Already Had Files on the Card","Pretty disappointed here. The company didn't send the adapter, so I had to ask for it and wait for it to arrive (1 week or so?)on top of the already ridiculous wait time for the card itself. Also, the memory card already had someone else's files on it! Unbelievable!"
5,memory card,"I purchased this for my LG VX 8600 phone. I popped it in, plugged the phone into the computer and was on my way to having a mp3 player for a phone. No problems, no complaints so far whatsoever. Having an all-in-one phone for actual phone use and music is great. On top of all that the seller got the item to me quickly and i am nothing but satisfied with the transaction in that aspect."
4,2gb @ 1 great price = 5 stars,"I don't know anything about memory cards but in doing a little research I learned that Sandisk is a name to trust. This was the size and type of card that was recommended for adding memory to a little pocket video camera I just bought. Arrived very quickly from the seller - thanks, Digital Media Source! I installed it in my device and it works perfectly.Great product, great price, a very smooth transaction; very pleased with this purchase."
3,Used in phone,"Used for a while in my phone until I upgraded to 8. it worked as expected, but that what memory does."
1,The old switcheroo,"Ordered product, with promo code.... promo code NOT accepted by the worst ordering form on the internet. I d.. near cancelled the order. When I go back to check I cannot find the product source for what I ordered - and the product itselt has a different source.Amazing Amazon - you have lost a potentially good customer."
3,Not for the A920,I had bought this card for the Samsung A920. Seems as though the phone will only work with up to 1GB of the 2GB card. A 1GB card works like a charm. The phone will see the 2GB card but will not play all the songs. So it may be more of a problem with the media player that the phone.
3,overloads CPU everytime,"I just got this from verizon. it works fine in my phone, but if i put in the SD adapter so i can slide it into my PC, the PC goes from 1% CPU usage to 50% in 1 second. the mouse doesnt respond and the PC is short of crashing. so i cant use the slot but can only use the phone to PC via USB which is not what i bargained for but i am keeping it since i got it for $75. also, i didnt format the card 1st so maybe that's the reason for the problems. they're the best memory company around so i guess its OK to go with this card. good luck."
2,Not sure this product is bug-free yet,"I've had many memory cards in the past and have several devices and computers to use them with, and never have I had a problem until this card.I paid top dollar and bought the SanDisk 2GB microSD card directly from a Cingular retail store for use with my Cingular 8525 phone, which I showed the rep and made them promise it would work fine.When I first brought the card home, it did show up as 2GB on my laptop but only 1GB on my Cingular 8525.I started to use it that way, but then the card errored when I started copying files to it, so I had to reformat it, and only FAT formatting would work using my laptop.Now, no matter how many times I try reformatting or erasing the card, it will only format as a 1GB card.VERY strange.TomP.S. Solutions would be great to have if you would email me at Tom288@aol.com"
5,Includes SD adapter,"What can I say. Its a memory card. It works.But to my surprise it included the SD card adapter. Wish I knew that in advance as I bought one separately.The item description did not list it, but would have saved me $0.85 on the buying additional item. :-)"
5,Great price,The memory card arrived and was as described. Price was a great deal and I don't see any difference from the higher priced ones charged at local electronic stores. Will purchase again when I need this product.
5,Perfect Product,I can put tons of music on my phone now instead of just 6 with the phone's internal memory. Well worth the buy.
5,SanDisk 2GB MicroSD Card,This 2GB preformatted microSD works perfectly in my T-Mobile Dash smartphone. No setup required - just insert and go! Lots of storage capacity at a great price.
2,Can't get support from SanDisk,"Don't bother trying to get any support, return or exchange it from SanDisk. They go out of their way to make it as hard as possible to do so."
2,Not what I expected,I did not realize that this card does not come with a card holder so it can be used in most cameras.
5,Exactly what I needed,"Works fine and does the job that it is required to do. Of course, memory is memory, and a name-brand is so much the better."
4,Good product,"I need expand memory of my phone. This product met my expectations but if you can buy memory with more capacity, do it."
3,Great,"I purchased 2 of these for my teenage kids cell phones. The chips installed easily and the phones recognized them instantly and displayed the available storage space appropriately. The memory chips were christmas presents so we have not had time to evaluate them except for the installation process.But, so far they are working great."
3,Good honest seller.,"First item sent was incorrect, but response and correction were quick. More than enough postage was reimbursed for exchange. Correct product was a great price and I am now very satisfied."
5,Memory Card for my phone,I am very pleased with this purchase. This is the second memory card that I have purchased for a mobile phone and I enjoy the results as much as the first time. I now use my phone as my MP3 player and its great.
5,Fasedown Rocks!!!,"This band has really matured over the years. It's self titled album really impressed me. However I was excited when I heard they had released a 2nd album since it had been five years since they had recorded anything new. I knew I had to check this one out because this band a lot to offer. Sure enough I was very pleased with what I heard from this band who really knows how to drive a sledgehammer to your skull with their heavy, pulsating guitar riffs and their insane vocals. Also their lyrics are really good too.You really need to check this band out because they have a lot going for them and will no doubt become big in the music industry. This cd is perfect for every hardcore fan and needs to have a place in your cd collection."
3,Cute and funny--though not really advice,"Cute book and has many humorous parts....especially if you are young and have been hooking up because many of the situations are relatable. However, I would not say it is a guide to hooking up or ""living it up"" but rather a commentary on the situations that revolve around a hook-up. I would borrow from a library rather than spend $10 for a new copy."
1,Ugh,This book is ridiculous. I can't believe it ever got published--it's that poorly written. Please don't waste your money on this book!
2,Girls want to be players,"This book was funny, i'll give it that much. My girlfriend picked up the book. Listen, while ""one night stands"" are fun, they get boring after awhile. I know several guys, and girls who like the relationship role. Anyone can go into a bar and get a woman or a man. While there is more competition in that scene, it's not to hard. Lastly, these girls need to find something better to write about, and stop trying to make a quick buck. I give it a two for the laugh I got"
1,Is this what our world is coming to?,"I'm horrified that a book like this could even be written. It's disgusting. Sex is not a joke, but this book treats it like it is."
4,Applies to Chicago,"I'm engaged and in the burbs now, but man...this book is 100% true for the bar scene in Chicago. First off, everyone has a cell. Secondly, most have at least 4 bootycall phone numbers. I cannot believe how free girls are with giving it up. Back in the early 90's, girls wore layers, there were no cells and you actually had to WORK at it. Well, this book is therapeutic and truthful. Every girl, regardless of upbringing, style, job, looks (innocent 3rd grade teachers are the biggest hoes), all girls are booty call participants. I'm 28 and all girls I associate with say they've had more than 12 partners. THIS book cements that theory. THANKS FOR THE GREAT READ."
5,I couldn't stop laughing!,"This book is hilarious-a fun, lighthearted and totally honest commentary on the whole hookup culture. As long as you're not expecting ""The Rules"" (barf) then you will totally get the joke and love it as much as I did."
1,The Guide to NOWHERE!,"This has to be the worst book I've ever attempted to read. I wasted $15 for nothing. This is not a ""guide"" to anything but a bunch of nonsense strategically arranged into silly little subtitled chapters with a sad attempt at using catchy humor! I made it to page 40, flipped through the rest, and then threw it right in the trash feeling like I wish I could somehow get my money back."
4,A fun book that's not to be taken too seriously,"This was a light read and it was very, very funny and very true in parts. I'm in a relationship right now and I found myself laughing. Don't expect a lot of serious ""advice"" though. Get it for the laughs instead."
1,Beyond Terrible!,"I bought this book because I have been researching and writing a paper about the ""hooking up"" phenomenon. Fortunately, I bought this book for a discounted price of less than $3. That, however, was $3 too much. This book is very poorly written and organized, and it offered no real insight into the ""hook up"" culture. Although I ended up reading the whole book, it was not pleasant. There are many other books about this that are more enlightening."
1,Horrible!!! Don't waste your money!!!,"I read the first few chapters and had to stop! This book is absolutely ridiculous! The authors were correct, the book is about ""hooking up"" literally! The book goes into detail about all the different types of actually hooking up!! Like we don't know this already!!! I was thinking that the book would be more about tips on hooking up, meaning meeting someone new.....not actually defining hooking up! Don't waste your money!!"
1,A book to sell other books,"On almost every chapter of this book the author just scratches the surface on interesting subjects and will reference other books instead of completing and going deeper into the subject himself. I didn't give a lonely star is because I did find some little bits of information. By the title you would think that it's a book to have; not so. If you can browse it, don't buy it."
1,hypnotically horrible,"The book should be entitled ""All sales and no substance."" This author keeps stringing the writer through a series of chapters, each saying that he is about to let you in on his secret, but instead he merely tells you more about his ebooks for sale online. His sales approach is not even very good. More like cheap and trashy. I've taken a few courses on hypnosis and can be hypnotized at the drop of a hat, but he couldn't hook me. I just found myself getting more and more annoyed. There are much better books out there. Don't waste your time or money."
2,Hey Joe,"Well, Joe has managed to put together another compilation of info he's gathered together from other sources. That's right, folks, nothing new here. I do think, though, that I learned more about self-promotion than anything else in this book. Using Joe as my example in effective writing techniques, I will now always include information about myself, my web sites, my promotions, and my other books on every page I write."
2,"rehash, recycle and nothing new","""Dr. Joe"" has some good ideas in this book but he beats them to death by recycling his concepts - it's almost like reading a freshman's term paper where they read the Cliff Notes and really don't have anything significant to add to the discussion, so you get a big SNOW job. I've read other works by the author and this is a weaker effort. Save your $$$."
5,"As you read this book, you'll be riveted, heart, mind and soul..........","By the time you start absorbing this book, you immediately discover your own amazing power to create...........Can you imagine, having Joe Vitale sit down with you? He looks you in the eye. He carefully and compassionately takes you by the hand and guides you. He holds nothing back as he carefully unfolds the amazing secrets of how to reach the spirit of your readers. His words and concepts marinate your mind and you feel the deepest yet gentle awakening while absorbing every word. You discover your own genius within to do what you've only dreamed of doing before you read this book. Joe Vitale's sincerity, integrity and true desire to move you to a level of personal excellence is unparalleled. With this book, he continues to amaze us all. Thank you, Joe.[...]."
1,Waste of money,I am disappointed with this book - boring which seems to be Joe Vitale's style - as much as I thought I liked him - I am starting to agree that although he might have had the right idea when he began - he is losing it in greed and glitz.
2,How not to write hypnotically,"I have read and enjoyed several books by Joe Vitale, but this is not one of them. I could never get into the book and found it very uninteresting. The only thing hypnotic about the way it was written, for me, was that every time I tried to read it I fell asleep."
5,Who else want to have 56 Hypnotic chapters in writing?,"Are you reading this line?May I know why?Do you know why?Have you notice how powerful it is?This is just one of little secret that I learn from Joe's ""Hypnotic Writing"" book. It is so simple and so easy to learn from Joe. He just never make it more complicated than simple.I start with 5 questions in this review which I learn from page 180 point 6. It is pretty hypnotic, isn't it?There are more that 240pages powerful hypnotic writing secrets for us to make our writing more Lively, and more Effectively. I see no reason why you should not buy or wait further if you want to improve your skill to persuade your customers using your words."
2,Pretty Disappointing,"This book had a couple of interesting suggestions, but it's mostly fluff. It would make a good magazine article-and, in fact, I realized after buying it that the author has some articles on the same subject available online. I wouldn't recommend spending any money on it, but if you receive a free copy, it's worth skimming. Or, better yet, just do an online search for the same topic and you'll find the few interesting tidbits in some articles."
5,Best book on how to write effectively,I am writing my 7th book and reading Hypnotic Writing has given me fantastic ideas to improve it and make it a bestseller. The book models perfectly what Joe Vitale recommends.
5,Great edutainment software!,"Excellent education/entertainment package. Both of my kids love to click the screen (almost anywhere) and watch the action.Arthur's fear of Mr. Ratburn (his new third grade teacher) is put to rest as Arthur begins to prepare for the spelling bee. Reading and spelling (as well as Spanish) are taught in this beautiful, exciting package that your kids will love.Arthur's Teacher Trouble was the first ""Living Books"" title we purchased. We now own about a dozen, but this is by far the favorite."
4,Missing Flat Washers,"The product appears to be sound and I think we will get several years use on the brick basketball court. However, there were six flat washers that had been removed from the seal packaging - delaying assembly until an extra trip to the hardware store was taken. Apparently the product had been returned prior to selling it to me.Huffy 80330 Combo Basketball Hoop 44"" Fan with Standard Basketball Rim"
3,"Ok IF you are looking for the workbook, not the textbook",...The book description still doesn't tell you it is only a workbook. They need to be more descriptive.
2,Not good.,"The questions in the workbook simply aren't helpful. And, a lot of times, they give the WRONG answer in the key!The only reason why I gave this two stars is because the chapter summaries are okay."
2,Is there anything positive in this book...,"aside from the success stories of everyone who has left the legal profession? I appreciate some of the self-assesment tools, but the remainder of the book is filled with anecdotes about miserable law students and lawyers who were much happier when they made a school or career change. The subtitle should be changed to ""NO! We don't think you or anyone should be a lawyer!"" Ridiculous."
4,A thorough look at a big decision,"As a career counselor I know what it can be like to support someone who is facing a huge decision of time and committment...or, perhaps, facing a decision to make a change away from the time and committment they have already indulged in! Should You Really Be a Lawyer does a great job in breaking down all those little conversations that go around in our heads and provides understanding so decisions can be made more clearly and effectively. I highly recommend this book as a tool for making an educated decision. The appendix at the end of the book also provides invaluable 'next step' guides that will be useful for any career crossroad!"
1,So bad....,"Well, My mom purchased this guitar for me..And it was my 1st guitar. But it is HORRIBLE!! I had my sister which is a guitar player (A good one..) tune it...She said it was out of tune no madder what! But seriously..Dont waste your money..I now have a Squier strat and its SO much better and easier to learn on and lasts! Its kid sized so ages 7-12 can play it..."
1,Terrible item!,"I bought this guitar as a birthday present for my 3 year old. I had no expectations for it whatsoever. I bought it to be a toy guitar, she's not capable of knowing the difference yet and I thought this would be a great way for her to learn.No. Not even a chance. She unwrapped it, dropped it a foot onto the floor, closer to preschooler put down and the neck detached from the body. Snap. 4 staples were holding it together. Not 5 minutes out of the box.I glued it back together, again, I'm figuring this is a toy. While restringing the plastic guard that goes over the strings snapped off.In the trash it goes. Worthless."
1,Poor Quality!,My daughter really didn't use it that much but within about 5 weeks it started to fall apart. The wood veneer on the base pulled up and splintered from tightening the strings to tune it. A low price for a guitar but I don't think it's even worth this price.
2,I should have known better,"The low price should have tipped me off. I purchased this for my 14 year old son, who needs a guitar for lessons at school. He has to leave the instrument in the class, so I wanted one that would not represent a big loss if stolen. Unfortunately, this is not a full size guitar, but closer to half size, which is very small for 14 year old fingers. This is best described as a toy, given the sound and quality of construction.The product description is misleading. If I had read more of the customer reviews, I would have been warned. I returned the instrument, but was not refunded the cost of shipping, which was more than the guitar itself. If this is intended for anyone over age 6, or anyone who wants a serious start in guitar, do not waste your money on this inferior instrument."
1,Horrible,"This is a HORRIBLE instrument. I should say ""toy"". Don't buy it! Save up your money a little for a better one! Its horrible. Thats all there is to say."
2,It got me started...BUT,"I bought this about 3 years ago cause I wanted to learn guitar. It got me started. It's a laminated guitar = very cheap, not well made. You can stratch the paint very easily--I've curved just about anything on mine. There's excess glue showing, another sign of a badly made guitar. It's durable enough. It doesn't stay in tune very well--for only about a day. The sound is terrible when you go up the fret. The action's pretty low but sometimes too low that you got fret buzz. The strings it comes with is bad--change it! The inlays are just stickers and they stratch right off. The neck is not fast at all. Sounds terrible with a capo!!!You can play actual music on it I guess though it leans toward the toy side. I've learned classical, folk, and rock music on it. I've played stuff by Dylan, James Taylor, and Phish on it but it just doesn't sound professional. Now I play a Gibson SG, thank goodness.Recommended: No."
3,"Toy, yes..Musical instrument, no!","This is a classic case of you get what you pay for. I bought my 5 year old this guitar because she started to show an interest since her brother was playing. A tuning peg pulled out literally within minutes of tuning for the first time. (Also, a child just learing should probably start with more comfortable nylon strings rather than steel) Anyway, if you want this for a toy it is probably okay, although it probably will be even more trashed if used that manner. Otherwise, bite the bullet and buy a real 1/2 or 3/4 scale instrument or just rent from an instructor."
2,It's just a toy--don't expect a real instrument,"Mnay reviewers have stated their diappointment in this guitar when they purchase it for a child to learn to actually play. Don't do that. It is not built correctly or scaled properly to hold a standard tuning. This guitar works well for my 3-year-old girl who wants a guitar ""like daddy's"", but she's 3 and not really learning how to play a guitar. It may be good for very basic concepts, but when the time comes to teach her how to play one, I will get her a sanely-priced, real child's-scale instrument from a real manufacturer (email me for suggestions if interested) and teach her to play.Learning guitar on one of these would be like trying to get your driver's license with a soapbox racer; it's not the right tool for the job, so don't expect it to be. Just take it for what it is: A toy."
3,Buyer Beware: Not a real guitar,"I was very disappointed with this guitar. I got it for my 7 year old nephew. I immediately took it to a guitar shop for tuning who informed me that it can not be truly tuned. In fact, it could only be tuned a full octave below a normal guitar's tuning. Also, it has steel strings which is much harder on a small child's hands. They recommended a guitar with nylon strings. I would suggest spending more money on a guitar that can be truly played and be truly tuned."
5,Great Little Guitar,"My six-year-old expressed an interest in playing guitar with me. I was hesitant about the First Act Guitar due to it's low price and thought I would have to pay much more for a good student guitar. However, I purchased the First Act Acoustic and have been enjoying my time with my daughter ever since.The guitar has a good sound and tone, is easy to tune and plays very well. I can use it to demonstrate chords and strumming so that my daughters (my five year old is now playing too) can hear what it will sound like on their guitar.Playable, affordable and fun ... who could ask for more!"
1,Not satisfied,"I went online to find the manufacturer for this piece of junk only to find that there are mostly happy customers based on the number of positive ratings here. I, on the other hand, have been wildly underwhelmed. First the neck became completely unglued and fell apart after owning it for a couple months. After re-gluing the neck, three weeks later the bottom piece that holds the strings also came unglued. I discovered that they had only fastened it down with one screw on the right side and nothing on the left. Not happy at all so I would recommend that you keep your receipt in case you get one of the lemons like I did."
4,"For younger kids, consider a ukulele","Even though this is a toy, it is still 30"" long, far too large for a precocious 2-year-old who is fascinated by Dad's guitar, and unimpressed by the Wiggles substitute I offered him. So I visited the local music store and plunked down $25 for a ukulele. It's just the right size for him and my 5-year-old. They don't miss the other strings. An open chord strummed over and over and over again doesn't sound particularly unpleasant. Just a thought for folks with children in the awkward age between electronic guitar-shaped toys and real guitars."
3,Good As A Toy,I Once Got This Toy And The Strings broke the second day of having it. I think this is a toy.i was tightening the strings and all of a sudden a string breaks. and it didnt bring the replacement string. it only brought some other ones.
1,Yikes....,"Guys...this is a TOY...if your child is seriously interested in learning to play guitar, you should actually search for a real instrument. Amazon.com offers 25"" guitars with accessories for only about $50...and they're actually pretty good. Don't waste your time with this thing...it's pathetic. Search for starter guitars in ""Musical Instruments""...not ""Toys"", you're asking for disappointment.It won't stay tuned.It doesn't come with anything that you need to start out with (picks, extra set of strings, books, strap, case...etc.).It's not even put together like a guitar should.Go for the real things. Don't waste your time with this..."
1,"DON""T BUY IT!!!( I am 32, I didn't want spammers getin my EM","The is a toy. I bought it for my son who is 6. I have been a guitarist since I was about 11. When ever my buddies come over and we play, he always listens to us wide eyed. I play electric, but I learned on acoustic. They acoustic I learned on is an adult full size, which I use acasionalaly. I wanted to get him one, I stoped at Wal MArt. Theirs were cheap and not real instruments. I stoped at the music store where I bought most of my guitars. They didn't cary anything that I liked. Either to expensive, or not good enough quality. I qent to toys r us. I grabed that guitar. It was getting late, so I didn't check it. When I got home I was about to tune it. I planed to in the morning put it next to his bed. It was untunable, aful condition, and missing frets."
