1,horrible,"Okay, i am usually not the type to give anything one to zero stars, but, this is awful. This movie makes fun of technology, I mean robots that are so smart and strong that everyone thinks they are the real people, but they can't talk unless they have a miniature brian that the arch enemy of the bad guy happened to build. plus the children act like babies. Fighting and teasing and being dumb. I was 10 when I saw this and am 13 now and never liked it it at all. The kids arent goood actors, the action is bland at best, and the ending is cheesey. the only good parts are when george clooney makes the guest appearance, and the ""Mushrooms"" joke. I am a fan of action/comedy/science fiction and classics like Cassablanca. I have seen many movies good and bad, but this is one of the 2 absolute horrible movies. the other being A.I.All in all, if you have a kid of 8 or less, they'll probably like it, or if you have to see it, rent it, you'll thank me"
1,Horrificly bad,"This is the most blatantly commercial and poorly written movie I have ever had the misfortune of laying my eyes on. This is a classic example of a how a movie tries to cover up that little thing called a plot with the modern glitz of special effects. I couldn't tell what the heck was going on half the time, and I kept wishing for the awful, predictable attempts at comedy to stop. The ad critics had made this movie out to be a 'hilarious, fun-filled family movie' but I soon realized what a pretentiously produced flick this really was."
1,discrase to mexicans,one of the worst movies ever made if could beat these kids for making such a bad movie i would all the stupid spy kid movies suck and come on we need more mexican movie extras not every mexcan movie extra has to be danny trejo or antonio banderas N terible acting
4,"Fun for all ages, a nice suprise.","I didn't go see this in the theater because the movie trailers led me to believe this film would be a bomb. Only after hearing great reviews from friends and family did I get the rental. What a pleasant surprise - especially with Rodriguez as the director (also known for Desperado). The kids are great in this movie because they aren't little shirley temple sugercandy, but rather realistic kids put in a fantasy of sci-spy magic. The plot was average but in a children's movie this is expected due to short attention spans. Many cute asides (harmless) throughout to keep the adults laughing too. A nice film that boys, girls, dads and moms will enjoy."
4,"Latino, and diverse!","Here's a mainstream movie, a kids' movie at that, which is Latino and diverse. Too often films for audiences of color are niche-marketed, thus making it so that only straight-white-middleclass-male movies are seen as universal. Here, children are taught to be proud of their Spanish last name. The son imagines friends with Spanish first names. The daughter takes voyages to Belize. They say Spanish phrases to each other. In addition, the DVD has Spanish and French dubbing. Something more fascinating: one never knows if the family is all-Latino or mixed, white-Spanish or minority-Latino. I love the way this film can speak to audiences beyond race, nationality, first-language, gender, or age. I recommend this DVD for children and their parents of all backgrounds."
3,Good But Not Unforgettable,"Parents will undoubtedly approve of this extremely enjoyable kids' romp that features no excessive violence, foul language or scary scenes. Newcomers Alexa Vega and Daryl Sabara play two regular schoolkids who find themselves turning into international spies when their parents (Antonio Banderas and Carla Gugino) mysteriously disappear without a trace. It is then that the children discover that their parents are actually secret operatives and not the normal boring old mommy and daddy they thought they were. Robert Rodriguez' latest film is absolutely full of visual imagination and cool gadgets, but his plot does feel like it could use a little help. It's not a serious criticism, though, as the film is buoyantly fun and the kids perform exceptionally well."
2,"The movie is fantastic, and it deserves better than this DVD","The DVD came out today, and I was really excited, I couldn't wait to go to the store and get a copy. Imagine my surprise when I discover that this DVD is just your bare minimum run of the mill DVD. It has the trailers, but that is it. The special edition that was released in theaters recently? The DVD box makes absolutely no mention of that. As near as I can tell, it's the original version. Don't get me wrong, the original was fantastic, but I expected so much more. I wanted to hear commentary by Robert Rodriguez, a featurette on the movie, etc- ANYTHING. I mean it's pretty sad when ""Dude, Where's My Car"" completely blows a movie like Spy Kids away with the DVD extras. My advice: wait for a deluxe edition to come out- I know it's coming!"
2,There should be an age limit,"I guess I'm getting too old for ""superhero"" movies. A weak plot and scattered attempts at humor made this movie too juvenile to be thoroughly enjoyed.Younger viewers (age 8 - 12) would probably enjoy this movie for its ""Kids save the day"" theme."
5,kids are very good spys,"this movie might be for kids, but its cool to me. I am 15 years old and i thought it was cool."
2,um.......................not so good!,I liked the actors and actresses but......the movie wasnt so great after all.I went with some of my friends and theysaid it was great they were 14 11 and 9.I was excited but when i saw it i didnt know what was so good about it!I likeda couple of the parts when the 2 kids were hidding out in that little secret place.But over all i give it 2 stars cause it wasnt so hot!
3,"Good, but not Great",This movie would have been much better if it wasn't for the idiotic floop guy. That part was horrible. They should have thought of a better villian. Otherwise it is very good.
1,I wouldn't even give this peice of junk 1 star...,"This whole movie was created with the same old cheesy and expectable lines and events all the children movies are. Don't get me wrong, children deserve movies they like too, but this is just worthless junk. How can movies get this stupid?! My step brother and sister saw this last summer & they came home saying it was sooo funny and cool, but it's lame. I can't even express how stupid this is. This movie should have NEVER been made, and these actors need to get some real roles, cos this storyline and plot sucks. Come on people, don't waste your time and money on this peice of (...), there's so many better movies out there. This whatever you wanna call it deserves to be burned and then some."
1,Too Much Hype,"Makes me never want to have kids! Just Kidding.There was definitely too much hype for this film, but it is a kid film, so what are you gonna do. However, I do believe that it wasn't good enough for a re-released in theaters.The best parts were probably the scenes with the kid mimicking his sister and the 'bad guys'. Virtual reality wasn't bad either.It's a kid film, meant for kids."
1,Completely..... utterly horrid,"The most worthless, boring piece of drivel you ever saw........ not much else to say."
1,A pretty bad flick.,"I started off watching this is a hopeful feeling, but was very disapointed with this movie.The basic story is as follows: Two kids have parents that are super spies, and who are determined not to let their children know. But when other agents vanish, they go off on the chase only to be captured themselves.Their children go off to look for them, using technology that is so unreal that it is unbelieveable.They find their parents in the production studio/island of the boy's favorite TV show, AND that the missing super agents have been mutated into the ugly characters of the TV show.The bad guys are after a miniture brain that will allow their kid robots to function normally. These robots are going to be used as spies, replasing the children of government officials.All in all, this movie was bad. The plot was bad, the characters were bad and the scenes were bad. Too unrealistic and too James Bond-like combined with a kids movie.Don't waste your money."
5,"The Best Family Movie Since ""Star Kid""","""Spy Kids"" has two very cool young up and coming performers. Alexa Vega, who plays Carmen, and Daryl Sabara, who plays Juni. The movie also has great acting by Antonio Banderas and Carla Gugino, who play the parents who are top secret spies. They get captured on a secret mission.The kids are under the watch of their fake uncle during this time. The house is attacked and this is when the kids find out that their boring parents are actually spies! The children are then sent to a special safe house that they know nothing about. The kids then get ambushed at their safehouse. They then go on a mission to save their parents by becoming spies.This movie is so cool. It has great cameos by great actors like, George Clooney, Cheech Marin, and Teri Hatcher. This is a wonderful family film that never gets boring so you'll watch it over again several times. I give it 5 stars."
3,Entertaining piece of fluff...,"My kids think this is REALLY COOL. It has some laughs, some ingenuity to the plot and production, but otherwise is a no-brainer. One for family movie time, but not much else..."
4,Fun for the whole family,"Clean, thrilling fun for everyone, from the little kids to the teens (well, the teens will watch it once or twice). My elementary kids watch this over and over!"
4,Another Robert Rodriguez HIT!,"From the production side of the movie, this was very well shot. It showed some traditional Robert Rodriguez ""In Your Face"" camera movements and editing style. The visual effects were clean and impressive. It looked very good considering his budget. The traditional Robert Rodriguez writing style was shown in this movie. The storyline was very fast-paced. Although it had some minor glitches, not a single second was wasted onscreen. I was surprised an hour and a half went by so fast. A good mix of action and humor, going back to his roots of making short family videos. Overall, an excellent film by RR and I can't wait for the final movie of his El Mariachi trilogy."
5,The Best Movie In Ten Years,This Is the best movie in the world. it has cool gizmos and gadgets and has a great plot. I think they should make a Spy Kids TV series. this is a must see movie. PS the DVD edition is so cool
4,Pretty Good,"At first, my family was not allowed to see this movie because of some of the crude parts and a couple foul words, but when we did watch it, it turned out pretty good! It may not be the best movie, but we all enjoyed watching it. Unlike some modern movies, this one emphasizes the importance of family, and grabs your attention with an intersting story fit with cool spy gadgets. It's fun to watch Carmen and Juni learn about Spy-work, and try to rescue their parents from Floop. Like I said above, there were some crude parts referring to ""poop"" and ""pee"", and a couple bad words. But I recommend it!"
4,Cute Family Movie,"I have a 3 years old who loves his ""kiddie"" movie collection. We recently added Spy Kids to that collection. It was well worth the money. Plenty of laughs and family moments are included. The gadgets got ""daddy"" interested and the fact that we could all watch it interested me. There were a few jokes that were for older kids, but the movies is definetly worth buying and viewing for family night."
3,"Great movie, shiitake DVD","This is a wonderful movie, perfect for both parents and kids alike. If you want a more in-depth review of the movie, read somebody else's review. Unfortunately, the studio opted to include practically nothing extra in with this DVD. The trailers for the movie, some ads for upcoming products, two foreign language tracks, and English subtitles are all that are included. No behind-the-scenes featurettes. No ""making-of"" documentaries. No cast and crew interviews. (Not even cast and crew ""filmographies."") And the worst sin of all: No Robert Rodriguez director's commentary. (See the DVD of ""Desperado"" or ""El Mariachi"" for examples of just how informative and entertaining commentaries can actually be.) If you haven't seen this yet, you need to, but rent it first. Save your money for the (cross fingers) Special Edition."
2,kids film,realy for th little ones.if you are over 9 years old look for another atraction.see you all in the movies.......:)
4,My 3 1/2 year old daughter enjoyed this film,"...on VHS tape. My Panasonic DVD-A120 rejected the disk, however, and refused to play it. Your young children will enjoy it, but the DVD may not play on your machine."
3,I enjoyed It.,"I never got to see Spy Kids in the movie theater but we rented the video and though it isn't the best childrens movie I ever saw I did like it, I liked Antonio Banderas, Carla Gugino, Alan Cummings, and the actors who played the kids especially the girl who played Carmen, And though I enjoyed this movie I do have to agree with others that this children's movie may not appeal to some older people, my Mom fell asleep and my older sister hated it and complained about it for several days especially giving me a hard time because I had picked the video but I know several other older people who liked it including another sister. I guess it's a movie that you either like or hate but I didn't hate it and thought it was a fun movie even though I would have liked to have seen the extra footage that several reviewers have mentioned and I will probably rent the special edition video when ever it is released."
3,Didn't live up to the hype.,"Honestly, with all the hype this movie got, I was expecting to be floored by the DVD. Eh. It isn't a bad movie. It's fairly well-written, and mostly sap-free. (Until the big squishy ending) Floop is a cross between Jack the Pumpkin King and Willy Wonka, and his theme song -- well, it's by Danny Elfman, so it sounds like every other song Danny Elfman ever wrote. Most of the acting is good. The exception would have to be the kid who plays Juni, who is possibly the worst child actor I have ever seen outside of a soap opera. His delivery is poor, he does not emote well, and he isn't even one of those cute kids who can get by on looks. The quality of the DVD is fine, but it's really lacking on extras. All you get are movie trailers and an add for the website. There is a trailer for ""A Wrinkle in Time,"" which looks pretty good. So, over all, it's a fun little family film, but nothing to brag about."
1,Wait for the Special Edition to buy this Movie,"what bothers me about studios and their releases of movies onto video is their idea that ielease the same movie two or three different times with added scenes each time, that they will sell more movies.it would be nice if they took the time to release the movie once and have the added scenes and title it ""Special Edition"" like it was re-released in the theatres.Look for this movie to be released again before christmas under the title ""Special Edition""Wait till then to purchase it...."
2,wrong version,"We missed the first release of the movie in theaters but my kids dragged me to the rerelease...which was fun....HOWEVER, the DVD is not the rerelease...it is the first version. The rerelease was much better....the entire shark scene has been left out on the DVD....there is a lot missing that made it a better movie. I am extremely disappointed that the DVD wasn't the rerelease."
4,Cute Kid Story.,"Nicely done, a little on the corny side, they really didn't need the Pee Wee Herman clone to carry it off."
2,"Not my kind of ""spy"" movie","Was Antonio Banderas being kind, or did he really think that he needed to lend his name to this film? The plot is lame and the action is almost non-existent. I would not recommend this for anyone over the age of 6. Want a good ""kid's"" movie? Try something else, anything else."
3,Got for Kids Visiting,I used to watch this when I was younger. Its pretty harmless and goofy. Mostly got it for visiting small kids to entertain with.
1,Mind-numbing,"Many kids movies are at least tolerable, if not somewhat entertaining, for adults. Not this one. My 8 year old son loved it though."
5,Spy Kids,"This is an awesome movie! It kinda freaked me out at first, but I liked it alot! It is full of action and adventure, comedy, and excitement all the way! I am definatley giving 5 stars! I don't know why anyone would give it less than four!THis movie is about two kids that fight all the time, and have parents that are spies. But they don't know it. Then the parents are assigned a mission and have to leave their home. SOmething goes wrong. The kids find out their parents are spies and decide to save them themselves."
4,A great movie for the family,"I was very pleased with this movie. My two boys enjoyed it greatly, they actually sat down and watched the whole thing. The only problem was they acted like spys for the next two weeks...but thank goodness that phase is over.The whole movie was very entertaining. The only part I didn't like were the ""monster like"" people the bad guy had created. They gave me the creeps. But my kids thought they were cool. The parents in the movie didn't dominate the screen like i thought they would...the kids did. It was good to see the kids become hero's..and it even had a moral of the story about families keeping secrets. It's a good movie. It would make a great gift for boys or girls."
2,Annoying Film,"Item arrived on-time and in condition advertised. It's just a really annoying film and I did not enjoy it. Just a matter of taste, I guess."
3,Better than expected,"I expected this movie to be terrible. The kind with nothing in it that is entirely stupid. This movie is NOT that type. When I watched this movie I was very pleased with what I saw. The movie has very dumb charecters, like the Thumb-Thumbs but all the technology stuff is cool. The plot isn't much, it is to save thier parents. Also it is unrealistic because when they get to a certain part of the movie it's liked they learned everything magicly. It doesn't show them learning or anything. There is plenty of action in this movie as well. This movie is also for the younger children. This DVD has NO Special Features at all which is very upsetting. Overall I say rent it for your kids and maybe watch it yourself."
4,spy kids,"Carmen and Juni are two kids who discover that their parents were once spies. The kids dress up as spies and uncover mysteries to save the world. This movie, and The 6th Day are two state of perfection and are worth watching if you like action adventures."
1,really bad,"if you are thinking about buying this movie dont be to disapointed when it turns out that its really badthe actors are the worst and the whole story doesnt make sensei dont know why people are making such a big thing about this movie, it is NOT WORTH ITsoo.. save yourslef your mony your time and your disapointment and forget about this movie"
1,What in the name of donuts?!!,"Ummm... Okaayyy... Yeah. Years later and I'm still asking, ""What is up with this movie?"" Whoever made this has some serious problems. I mean really. Serious problems."
1,"Not for kids, not for adults","I would have turned off this movie after the first ten minutes, but I thought, ""It had so many good reviews, it can't be this bad for the whole movie!"" It was, however, one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. It was too unreal and juvenile to be entertaining for anyone over age eight. I would not want my kids to see it; the themes are too frightening for younger children: bizarre TV shows are real, good people are bad, adults in general are not to be trusted, kids need to take care of themselves."
1,Are you people high?,"Spy kids is undoubtedly the WORST movie ever created! Spy kids had absolutely no appeal to all. I was very sursprised at this movie because I saw that it was written and directed by Robert Rodriguez (One of my favorite's ""the faculty""). I like to keep an open mind but this movie is PATHETIC. the thumb things!? HOW RETARTED! the special effects are just bad and the acting by the children is atrocious! I saw the one kid interviewed and he is like ""um...we-ll...um..."" He can barely talk! Great casting guys! This movie also wastes great acting talent...Antonio Banderas and Alan Cumming! What are they doing in a movie called spy kids? This movie is absolutely terrible and should never have even been released! AVOID AT ALL COSTS.OVERALL SCORE: 39/100Direction:8/20Plot:7/20Cast:15/20Fun:3/20Special Effects:6/20"
4,Wonderful!,"Okay, i should give it 5 stars, but i sort of think that this is the most appropiate rating, ""Spy Kids"", is filled with imagination, action, cleverness, and wonderful acting, i didn't wanted the film, to end, also the film has a lot of hispanic references, since i am from Mexico, this felt a lot to me, in a sort of Telemundo way, also i hope that the DVD, has a DTS track, also the film is very clean, it dosen't have any crude humour, even though i liked ""See Spot Run"", this one was way better, i gived the other film ***1/2, so, there is going to be a sequel, not a bad idea, CHECK OUT THE INTERNET MOVIE DATABASE FOR MORE INFO!"
3,Watch OUT. You WILL end up buying it twice!!,"Am I the only person who is REALLY tired of studios releasing a movie on dvd & shortly thereafter seeing it released as a special,collectors,platinum,director's cut,deleted scenes,alternate endings,bonus footage...edition. If you notice, this dvd states in it's description that it contains the ORIGINAL theatrical presentation. Does anyone think that in a few months the additional footage which was rereleased in theaters will be included in a new dvd designed to make you buy it TWICE? The dvd makers are the new snake oil salesman. At least with this one you can be 99.9% sure that if you wait you will get a better dvd."
4,spykids for all ges,"1.The dvd runs for 88 minutes.2.From the beginning till the end there is good tempo.3.Entertainment for the whole family.4.No dirty/filthy language in dialogue5.you come to know ""as you sow, so you reap"".maxim6.Child teaches man>""The child is the father of the man""7.Background music, trick photography shots,multipilicationof figures etc. are all superb.8.Thanks are due to all who made this wonderful children'sentertainment movie."
3,Made for children,"My son enjoyed the movie. The only version he saw in the theatres was the special edition and, unless I missed something, the sharks were not in this video. He was rather disappointed.It is definitely a ""kids only"" movie. Rather immature in many aspects.One question I still have...why didn't she just put on a wig?"
4,PLEASE give us the Director's cut on blu ray.,"For some strange reason the original Spy Kids movie has never been released with the Director's Cut footage inserted on August 8, 2001 in the theatrical rerelease. I can't believe after 10 years the footage SEEN IN THEATERS has still never made its way onto a dvd but hopefully it will be on the blu ray release. I've read that a commentary was already recorded for the Director's Cut also. INSIST on the full length movie."
5,Spy Kids (Widescreen) DVD,"I purchased this on DVD since I used to own the VHS. I haven't watched any of the Spy Kids movies for years! I watched the first one again for the first time. I never noticed how cheesy the special effects were, but I still loved it. It was funny and creative and funny see Danny Trejo as (Uncle) Machete! I love the Spy Kids movies and can't wait to catch the new spy kids ""Spy Kids 4: All the Time in the World"". The Spy Kids Series is a definite must own."
5,Beautiful affirmations with glorious artwork,"Taken together, Claudia Black's meditations and Laurie Zagon's artwork are beautiful, affirming, and therapeutic. Black's words are deceptively simple, and can be returned to again and again for reassurance and comfort, and Zagon's drawings are exquisite. A wonderful gift for anyone working through childhood issues."
3,Inspiring,This is to be read slow and with much thought. Each page is very short with images and thoughts that hit home for those of us that come from 'not so happy' childhoods. I have read it twice and will pick it out of my library again when in need of that inspirational message.
1,The Emperor's New Affirmations Book,"This book contains abstract paintings accompanied by affirmations such as ""You are good enough! You are good enough! You are good enough!"" I suppose you are meant to look at the paintings while thinking the affirmations. If you think that spending money on this book and looking at those color swirls is going to improve your life to any degree whatsoever, then you really are confused."
2,so-so apricot syrup,I was expecting a more intense apricot flavor. I will not be buying this product again.
3,to costly,this product was good but the cost to have it delivered and the size of the bottle made it to expensive to buy it again. I thought the items cost was alright but the mailing cost was double the products cost.
5,Usborne First Encyclopedia of Seas and Oceans,I like these books because they are great to use with ESOL students who are learning to read English and have to do sophisticated work in the content areas. These books help by providing an easy to read passage and plenty of photographs. They are very helpful. Young kids will love them too.
3,Advanced Wah,"Good wah, side buttons are a little tricky to manuver. Lots of tone, mostly harsh, not enough sweet spots. Desgned for the modern player, wanting Slash or Hoey brutal growl."
1,A boot....,This is not an official release...anything with weird things like coasters & what not are generally boots.don't waste your money.
1,Disappointing product is not authentic,"It's upsetting to me that someone not only makes this product (for a profit) that is in NO WAY affiliated with Tori Amos, but that Amazon.com will post this product as legitimate. Be warned: You are not supporting this artist by purchasing this product."
1,Do not waste your money,This expensive book shows equations without practical examples or cases.Only equations nothing more. I wasted my money on it.
4,Good music can transcend faith.,"Like a lot of people, I have a slight problem with fiercely Christian artists (much in the same way I'd have a problem with any fiercely Jewish artists, militant straight edge artists, white power artists, etc.), however, Pedro the Lion's music transcends faith and stands on it's own as a great record. At 34 minutes, this one also doesn't overstay it's welcome. I'd give it 4 1/2 stars if I could, but alas.. Recommended for any indie rock fan that doesn't have any serious issues with passively religious records or artists."
5,Haunting story,"This short album seems to be the bands most successful ""concept"" album. Concept in the sense that the whole album seems to be a chilling tale of a man who kills his wife. At first listen, when still getting to know the album for the musical aspect, it is very pleasant. But i specifically remember truely listening to the lyrics for the first time and having to start the songs over to make sure i heard them correctly. This christian rock band, that is known to me by making very pleasant and mellow music, wrote some very disturing lyrics. This juxtaposition of an extemist ""bad"" person to show how to more or less be a ""good"" person, to me is genius. Or perhaps im way off base, I dunno, thats just what i got from it."
3,meh....,"This cd is ok, but not great. There are a few good songs on it, even a great one (#4). On some songs, the lyrics lack the creativity which makes me such a big Pedro fan. The story that is told through the album is a pretty cool effect, if you figure out what's going on. Overall, the CD is decent, but definitely not worthy of four or five stars, as so many people so eagerly give away. I would recommend another CD by Pedro, instead."
3,Selling depression wholesale.,"PEDRO THE LION is critically acclaimed and often held up as an example of where folk/emo can/should be going. This rating is more of a composite of a lyrical and musical review. The music here is great and as a big fan of this style, I enjoy it immensely. Lyrically, I find this album an absolutely depressing experience. Yeah, I know he is telling a story of a man's downward spiral. That is depressing by nature. But this is just a bit too much for me. Something about his lyrics disturb me to the point of not really wanting to listen to the album-and that is counterproductive. I guess I'm no longer one of those people who 'enjoys' being depressed by music and feeling somehow smarter and wiser for the experience. No thanks."
4,Pedro-King of Emo,"This is a terrific album. The story itself is such a cool concept, then to surround the story with great guitar work, and excellent drums...Mellow but meaningful. He compliments the slow songs with the fast paced tunes like Simple Economics, A Mind of Her Own, and Never Leave a Job Half Done. Altogether an amazing album. He's also a great guy in person, which makes listening to this album even more enjoyable."
1,Give me a break,"I don't understand why a cheap ripoff (REM circa 1983) ""group"" like Pedro the Lion receives such glowing reviews. The songs on this album, are quite frankly boring. The lyrics are incredibly pedestrian, the mix is terrible. I wrote songs like this too, when I was 15 and in my ""nobody likes me, everybody hates me, I think I'll go eat worms"" phase. And, no, in case you are wondering, I am not criticizing this because it is Christian...I was hoping it would be good, but this is just another example of a less-talented artist being given undeserved accolades because of their faith (""Left Behind"" series anyone...)"
5,A Charming CD,"This CD is charming and fits perfectly with the movie. I love the movie, and it is easy to recall scenes from the movie when hearing the songs on the CD. The soundtrack is well worth the money."
2,Beautiful But Disappointing,"While the Little Women film was wonderful, the accompanying soundtrack was disappointing. The tracks appear in random order with no rhyme or reason. Logic suggests it would have been appropriate to play them in sequence. However, each song included is lovely. The main title, Orchard House, is frostily beautiful and lyrical. It calls to mind the simplicity and serenity of a New England winter. Valley of the Shadow, while breathtakingly solemn, plays for just over two minutes, which is far too short. Several other tracks: Scarlet Fever, Two Couples, Burdens, Harvest Time, Amy Abroad, and The Laurence Boy, give the listener much too little. Each lasts only 90 seconds or less. For the hefty pricetag (I purchased it years earlier at a national chain bookstore, yes, I know, stupid) I think the editor should have given more bang for my listening buck. Devotees of the film will enjoy the cd."
5,pretty tunes,"This music perfectly captures the period in this story. Short and quaint, these tracks do a great job of matching the scenes in the film, but they are also wonderful listening apart from the film, especially the End Title ""Under the Umbrella"" with its wonderful violin vigor and blasting horns. Another personal favorite is the 15th track ""Amy Abroad."" What an exciting and exquisite tune! Also, I was touched by the slow, sad 21st track ""Valley of the Shadow"".David Rehakauthor of ""A Young Girl's Crimes"""
5,I get chills when I hear this music,"Thomas Newman is a genius and the soundtrack to Little Women is no exception. His music is like exquisite art and you feel sorry that there aren't more soundtracks like this one out there.Thomas Newman also composed the score for ""Finding Nemo,"" so if you listen closely, you can hear the trademark strings that are both in ""Little Women"" and ""Finding Nemo.""I only wish the selections were longer than a minute or two!"
5,For work and for some pleasure,"It is scored by Thomas Newman, that is all that someone really needs to know. I actually had purchased this soundtrack for a production of Little Women at the high school I work at but figured it is worth throwing in my opinion on it. The music has all of the usual characteristics of Newman's touch so you won't find anything terribly ground breaking. However, why change/fix what isn't broken."
5,Absolutely love it!,"Nothing at all bad to say about this gem. Every song is a beautiful joy to hear. If you love Americana-type music, and just want to hear something that is beautiful and pure and lovely, this is the one for you. Buy it!"
5,Love this Little Women Original Soundtrack,"Thomas Newman is one of our favorite Composers. He also wrote the scores for Meet Joe Black, The Green Mile, and most recently The Help and The Adjustment Bureau amongst many others. We saw this movie years ago and then again recently and realized we just had to have this. For a change, all of the original soundtrack is included. I don't think they cut anything out from the original motion picture. Make a nice breakfast or dinner and put this on in the background. You won't be disappointed."
1,Bought 2 and neither worked,"I purchased 2 of these units. I plugged in both and waited for the batteries to charge. The first unit claimed that the batteries were fully charged after about 15 minutes, but they only lasted about 30 minutes in my Garmin Rino 130 (should have lasted several hours). Trying again the charger indicated fully charged again in 15 minutes. Apparently no good. The second set continued to charge and after about 3 hours the unit overheated and melted with the batteries expanding and leaking."
1,Very bad....,This is not a good charger-seems like it doesn't charge the batteries to full capacity. Can't get more than max an 1 hour and half out of these batteries with my Canon S2. Basically they seem to suck-big time. I've already charged them like 3 times before even starting to learn the camera!! Maybe they will become better after a while-don't know....
1,Digipower DPS-5000,"I purchased this product despite the negative reviews I had read. This was a mistake as this product was no goog right out of the box. It did not charge the batteries longer than 5 minutes. I had to keep unplugging it so it would continue to charge. After all this, the batteries were still not charged. It would have cost more to send it back so I just shelved it with a goog lesson learned. Listen to the reviews next time."
5,Great addition for my cannon,I bought this as an adjunct to the new Canon camera I bought.. it is certainly a convenience to always have batteries available when needed. The charger does what it says and charges very quickly. You can charge 4 at a time and always have a spare.
4,digipower,"Even though I have used it only a few times, it seems to have proven out to be just the tool to produce charged batteries as advertised. I am quite satisfied with the unit. LG"
1,Can't do much to save this film,"This is by far the worst Jaws film ever made. I mean, come on, why was this ever even made in the first place? The script is bad, the acting is bad, the special effects are even worse, and the ending is very VERY laughable. Some people say that Jaws 3D was horrible, well it's not as horrible as this piece of #$%@ right here. Pass."
2,LAUGH-A-MINUTE-EXTRAVAGANZA,"The original Jaws is one of the finest Horror, and film of any genre ever made. Jaws:The Revenge is not. Mind bogglingly stupid premise, rather poor acting and direction, some may say this is the apitemy of a ""Bad Movie"". However I must say I found the wild antics of this zany shark outrageously amusing in places and think that some of the film's score would have been better replaced with such tunes as Scott Joplin's 'The Entertainer' or Herb Alphert & the Tijuana Brass performing 'Spanish Flea'."
1,The Most Laughable sequel in film's history.,"How can a shark go travel from Martha's vineyard to the bahamas, this sequel is the most idiotic piece of tripe, I Ever seen in my life, it's a shame that quality actors are wasted in this one, the shark is horrible and the ending is the worst ever in film, Let's hope that Sequels will never be, Not ever againJaws the revenge is a trainwreck waiting to happen.NO STARS."
1,This is Crap,"This is not only the worst Jaws ever made, but it is the worst movie in general I have ever seen. People were concerned about not seeing enough shark in the previous movies? Well, you saw way too much in this one, and it had to be the worst special effects they could have thrown together. The shark even stands straight up in the water, vertical, not moving, for about 15 seconds waiting to be hit. Then, when he hits the front of the boat, somehow the entire rest of the boat is affected? It suddenly falls apart. .... I wish that there was a zero star option, because this movie doesn't even deserve it. DON'T BUY THIS MOVIE, DON'T EVEN WATCH IT! Cheesy, fake, predictable, stupid, horrible, insulting. All words that describe this movie in its entirety."
1,Just when you thought it was safe to see another sequel...,"The only thing missing was the scene where Lorraine Gary looks out of the window of the 747 at 20,000 feet to see a tiny shark fin protruding from the waves of the Atlantic pursuing the plane to the Bahamas! A word of advice: move to Kansas! This script is so ludicrous it must have been written by a six-year-old kid while playing with his action figures in the bathtub. I was half expecting to see Robert Shaw getting regurgitated from the mouth of the shark so he could come back and reprise his role as Quint from the first film, give another mind-blowing 10 minute monologue, avenge himself upon the shark for eating him and save the movie from absolute stupidity."
2,Not as bad as i'd thought but downright unbeliveable,This movie took the series out of hand even more than the third one. Reverting back to the character line from the first two The fourth one follows a shark who is supposed to have scared the major character from the first two into a heart attack and now he's killed his youngest son. His widowed wife takes a trip to the Bahamas so she can see her eldest son who is a marine biologist there. But the shark is apparently a mastermind and knows where she's going and decides to follow her there. Of course they have to kill the shark in some stupid way this time shoving a bow of a boat through the shark.This movie was the most idiotic of them all. The body count was too low and there was no possible way this could've actually happened. Not worth seeing and just plain bad.
1,Jaws The Revenge(Jaws 4-Last Sequel Thank God!),"I would rather had watched Jaws 3(Jaws 3D) with it's quirky plot and absurd story than watching this convoluted mess, First off Sharks are intelligent and do travel but this must be the only Shark That has A PH.D! traveling from fictional Amity(East Coast) to The Caribbean? Also Is this Jaws A Family member of the first? who gave him the memo to avenge his Finned Friend or family? and why the roar like the one in previous jaws?(Jaws 3/3d).the movie is more drama than shark, with the shark making zany appearances throughout,What was Michael Caine and Van Peebles thinking? I hope to God that there will be no ""Reboot"" or Sequel to Jaws,Leave it alone and avoid this movie like the plague."
1,DUD.,Don't waste your money on this boring sequel. It's stupid. There's nothing good about this movie. Avoid it.
1,Another sequel gone bad,"JAWS IV is just another sequel gone bad. Stick with the original JAWS.Basically here is the plot - the youngest Brody, Sean, is killed by a great white shark in Amity. Michael Brody - the oldest son - comes to Amity with his wife and child from the Bahamas. Ellen Brody goes to the Bahamas for a visit where another shark begins terrozing her family.I guess one of the drawbacks of this film is this: There are two endings to this movie. Of course you never see them in the same film. The character of ""Jake"" is killed in one version - he lives in another.As a JAWS fan, I found this movie to be partially entertaining but mostly disappointed with the acting, especially Lorraine Gray and Michael Caine. Also, the entire idea that two sharks come into contact with the Brody family is too non-believable. Or is the producer telling us that he expects us to believe the shark from Amity is the same shark from the Bahamas???Again, stick with the original. You find a better movie."
1,"SHARKS DON""T GROWL!","I hate this movie please don't go see just try and think of it this way there was jaws, then there was jaws 2, and that's it don't even concern yourself with the other two."
1,Simply Awful Movie.....good for a few laughs,"What a terrible movie...without spoiling anything let me just tell you a few things..first the shark has an amazing ability to travel from Maine to the Bahamas faster than Ms. Brody takes to get there by plane. There are so many stupid things in this movie I could go on forever but the crowning stupid moment has to be when ""Jaws"" jumps fully out of the water and stays suspended in the air balancing on his tail for a full 5 seconds and (drum roll please!) roars...yes roars like a lion!This definitely has to be one of the worst movies ever made...it great for laugh though!"
1,The Director of This Movie Should Hide in Shame,"The top 5 best scenes in this movie:5. The shark roaring like a lion.4. Ellen Brody having flashbacks to scenes from the first ""Jaws"" even though she wasn't in those scenes (like when her husband says ""Smile, you son of a..."")3. Shark exploding after getting hit by boat.2. Mario Van Peebles surviving what should have been a fatal shark attack. (in the original version, he does die, but this is what happens when movie executives change movies based on audience suggestions)1. After the shark attacks his plane, Michael Caine swims from his plane to the boat, but when he comes out of the water, his shirt is DRY!"
1,"Shark's do NOT take things personally, universal!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","I have two words to describe this movie: painstakingly pathetic.JAWS was legendary, JAWS 2 was strong, JAWS 3 (or JAWS 3-D) was notoriously compost, and sadly, JAWS the revenge is utterly the crap... I mean, most awful movie ever known to man!One shark seeks bloodthirsty revenge against the Brody family, picking them off one by one. Stupidly the star of our show is not even in it, Cheif Brody. And then Sean, his son, is killed. What a horrible way to end a once amazing series. Personally, I don't even think why they bothered with JAWS 3 & 4. They're both pretty crud. No, correction. Bad for ur health! Finally Ellen brody must go out and kill the shark.This movie is rubbish! The shark is really fake! And its really boring and stupid. The only good thing about this movie is that it has a shark in it. That's it.A load of poo. Don't buy it. WARNING: Viewing be fatal to your health."
2,worth a C-,"Ive always been a Jaws fan but when i saw this i thought what the heck were they thinking. No shark is going 2 travel from New England 2 the Bahamas or wherever. But then again all movies arent true. I mean no one made a big deal when things like lake placid came out...... or at least i didn't here. The shark has 2 be the worst looking one of all. When it starts biting the boat, it looks either rubbery or a puppet. I thought though on the plus side that Michel Cain played a good role.I still don't know why they changed the ending 2 the shark blowing up.I thought the first one was all right really. And no one wants 2 see sean get eatin. They actually wanted Chief Martin Brody 2 get killed but he said no and thats better. In the end its not the worst movie I've seen but still cruddy. I hope if they have a sequel the cast and crew knows more."
3,Gimme a break!,"Why would a shark revenge? Sharks don't care about other sharks. Besides, how would this shark know which people are part of the Brody family? This shark also doesn't look anymore real than the original."
3,"JAWS THE REVENGE, IT'S OK","IT'S NOT THE BEST JAWS MOVIE AND IT'S NOT THE WORST EITHER,IT IS OK. IT IS GOOD TO BUY [IF YOU LIKE THE JAWS SEIRES]."
5,JAWS,"Jaws is my number one film of all time, it always has, and it always will be. I love everything about the film. Steven Spielberg did a grand job making this film, Robert Shaw, Roy Schieder and Richard Dreyfuss did a grant job as the main character, and John Williams did a grand job writing and composing the music score. My favourite actor is Robert Shaw and my favourite character is Quint. I am interested in killer sharks very much, mainly great whites, and the only boat in the world that I would love to own is the Orca. There are so many reasons why I love the film JAWS, I can't mention them all now because I will be here all day. I am so looking forward to the DVD release this year, and as soon as I found out that JAWS is going to be a collector's edition like THE THING and THE MUMMY, I couldn't believe it. What would we do without Steven Spielberg and John Williams? God bless them both. Written by Darren Fuge."
2,The Second Best Jaws Ever.,JAWS the revenge is exciting but not as good as the first. Although it will keep you scared! If you like Jaws you don't need to see this one.
5,as good as guilty pleasure gets!,"this is certainly one of the worst movies in cinema history. It has plot holes as big as (fake) sharks and the most incoherent & unbelievable story ever (a shark following a family from New England all the way to the Bahamas just to have his ""revenge""? Come on!), but it's fun! It's one of the funniest movies ever. Still today i can't believe how anyone involved in this, thinking it was a sequel to Jaws. Although the story is even more ridiculous than that of Jaws 3-D, it is much better. This movie will have you laughing the entire time. If it's not the incredibly corny story, it'll be the ridiculous looking shark and his even more ridiculous acrobatics routine.If you like guilty pleasure-movies, then you'll love this one!"
1,"Amazing, simply amazing.........",....amazing that the great Michael Caine would associate himself with such a dreadful movie. This is among the worst movies I've ever seen.
1,That Must Be One Smart Shark!,"The shark is able to follow Mrs. Brody all the way from the New England coastline to the Bahamas after she flees the area (by plane)following the shark's killing of her youngest son. The shark must be very proficient at geography. It must also be somewhat different from other sharks in other respects as it is my understanding (and I could be wrong) that sharks are cold-blooded and unable to survive in a warm ocean environment such as the Caribbean. The shark also must have a somewhat different digestion system as it was able to eat ALL of Michael Caine's airplane. YES, all of it in one large swallow.Folks, if you can accept such absurd plot elements, be my guest and buy this film. If you are more discriminating, however, and prefer to have the plot and story elements immersed in logic, then stay FAR, FAR, away. Buy the original ""Jaws"" instead. That was the only one worth seeing to begin with."
2,It would be halfway decent if they'd just remove the footage of the shark,"If you go to the gift shop at any Sea World park you can probably find a plastic or rubber toy shark, and it will look five times better and more realistic and lifelike than the one in this movie.The only interesting and redeeming feature of this film is the gimmick of putting a camera on the shark's POV (or rather, his dorsal fin's POV). In an odd way, it works.An early scene in the film shows one of Brody's sons being attacked and eaten by the shark during the Christmas season. It reminded me of a ""Jaws"" novelty song that was released just before Christmas in 1975. It was a parody of ""A Visit from St. Nicholas"" -- I remember a line that went, ""And what to my wondering eyes should appear/but Santa Jaws, who ate tiny reindeer"". Poetry.Michael Caine missed accepting his Academy Award for ""Hannah and her Sisters"" in person because he was on location filming this turkey."
1,Not Even Whimsically Stupid...Just Stupid,"I saw Jaws the Revenge when it was in the theaters. I was 5 years old and liked it. Then I watched it many years later. I realized how terrible it really was. Newsflash, Sharks lack vocal cords, therefore, they can't make sounds like a dinosaur. Anyone interested in buying this dvd, should wait for it to air on television, and then shut it off after the opening credits. I've been told that if any thing with the shark were to be lifted out, it would be ok. I agree."
2,"For continuity, skip Jaws 3D, watch this one","Jaws, a classic. Jaws2, a decent, if not somewhat repetitive sequel. Jaws 3 (whether it's in 3D or not) is just plain old sad. Jaws 4 eeks past the third stinker if only for the fact that the opening of the film gives us a handful of the original characters from the first two films, played by the original actors. If only the writer had left the action in Amity and focused the story on Mrs. Brody's inner nightmares, we might have had a decent follow-up. Instead, we get an inane trip to the Bahamas. This one put the nail in the franchise's coffin."
1,This film is a crime against humanity - absolute garbage,"I am truly speechless. Whomever was involved in this movie, from the producers, director, the actors to the grips - should be on trial for crimes against humanity. You are an absolute idiot to watch this movie, let alone buy this piece of _________. Fill in your own expletive. The worst movie ever made. All involved in the creation of this ""piece"" should be embarrassed. God have mercy on all of us for this abomination."
1,There is nothing Bahamian about this movie.,Before you direct a film that is supposed to take place in a foreign country I think that it is a good idea to study the culture. I think that the thing that would have helped this film considerably would have been if the director had learned about the Bahamian people. He obviously didn't do that. If he did he would have hired Bahamian actors to play the part of the Bahamian characters.
1,This movie SUCKS!!!!!!!,"I h8 this movie!I really think its stupid.I mean the shark from Jaws 1,2,or 3 could kill this shark in 1 bite.It is a sucky shark!I mean you have to be ""stupid"" to think it looks real!The movie has a gay plot!It has no point of being a movie!Don't buy it!The shark roars & stands on its tail!"
1,i'm still waiting for...,this movie has nothing to do with the original jaws i didn't even wait untill the movie was finished i pressed the stop button after 10 min and i am still waiting for the first part and second part of jaws to come on dvd.
1,What the heck?,Why on earth is this awful movie on DVD and the original Jaws isn't? Who is gonna buy this thing? I'm getting a headache just thinking about it.
1,miserable,the first shark attack should have earned this film an X rating. A dreadful movie. An embarassment to Jaws's great name.
3,Enjoy it for what it is . . . Escapist entertainment,"OK . . . so the storyline about the Great White Shark following the surviving members of the Brody family to the Bahamas is ridiculous . . . folks, this is escapist entertainment, pure and simple. Those looking for something deep and profound should look elsewhere. What a nice surprise the Goodtimes DVD turns out to be . . . the widescreen aspect ratio reveals some beautiful photography and is a vast improvement over Goodtimes' LP-speed VHS cassette. Interestingly, up until Universal's DVD release of the original ""Jaws"" for the 25th anniversary in the late Spring of 2000, ""Jaws, The Revenge"" was the first and only DVD available in the four film saga. One wonders whether Jaws 2 and Jaws 3 will ever be released on DVD. Maybe Goodtimes will come to the rescue. The Goodtimes DVD offers no extras other than the usual chapter breaks and English/French/Spanish subtitles."
2,"YOU'LL HATE YOUR SELF IN THE MORNING, BUT ENJOY!!!!","This is undoughtably a bad movie. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. But it's actually entertaining to watch! It's fun! It's funny! And it's disgacefully unrealistic! A Great White in the Bahamas, sharks roaring! Who does the shark stand up out of the water? And it can actually single out and hunt members of the Brody family! Watch it. If you like the JAWS movies, buy it! You'll watch it, like it, then about an hour later you'll say ""Why????"""
3,Variant Editions?,"I don't know weather it's just in England that theres 2 versions of this movie, one in which Peebles dies and one in which he survives, one version uses the original movies sharks demise(Explanation very welcome). All in all only rated as a 3 by a die hard Jaws fan."
4,"ALRIGHT,ALRIGHT! I GET YOUR POINT ALREADY!ALL THE COMPLAINTS","THIS ,I MUST SAY, IS A VERY UNDER RATED MOVIE! OKAY SO IT ISN'T ANY WHERE NEAR THE ORIGINAL, BUT HEY, THE ACTING IS GREAT, AND PERSONALY, I ENJOYED THIS MOVIE,THANK YOU VERY MUCH!"
1,stupid jaws movie,I have never seen this film but by what I have heard I would jump into the water and drown before seeing this what looks to be god damn awful crap. In fact I have not seen any of the Jaws sequels in fear of ruining my perception of the orginal. Jaws 1975 is a classic and is a overruling boss compared to this crap ass movie. I don't get why the original even needed any sequels but if you ask me the one reason is money. Because those god awful universal bastards can't get enough of it. I have already bought the jaws blu ray!
1,Soap opera elements wrong for a Jaws film,"This movie, unlike the first two pictures, actually has soap opera type storyline. Ellen tells her daughter-in-law, Carla, about the former's feelings for Hoagie. We never saw such sappy elements in the previous films in this series. Everyone rightfully picks on the extra-foolish storyline but let's not forget the soap elements sink this turkey more than it's already sunk anyhow."
1,Were they trying to make fun of the 70's?,"In 1987 America was really caught up in it's cheesy 80's trend of Miami Vice and singer Madonna and such. People hated things from the 70's at that time. I wonder if they were trying to belittle the 70's with this almost totally turdish sequel to a hit 1975 film (the great first Jaws) with rotten lines like ""He was the tomato thief of all time"" and ""I want you to get out of the water""."
1,"Crud, one good eaten scene","Crummy movie, yes. Only good eaten-scene in this one is the woman who gets eaten on the banana boat. She's obviously a MILF, and the shark rises up (a little too high probably) and pulls her off. They show her grind her teeth in agony and blood squirts around. As the boat zooms away, we get a shot of the shark diminishing into the distance, and the woman is in its mouth, clamped about up to her lower waist, her arm back in the air (it always reminded me of a gory rodeo). Then we see the shark close up, sinking into the red water, the dead MILF going with him.Oh, and PS: I swear as heaven is my witness, in the VHS rental version that I originally saw this movie on, Jake resurfaced at the end of the movie, chewed up but alive and in good humor as I remember (I think he said something like ""Come on mon, come help me out!"" And back on shore Ellen Brody asked Mike how Jake was, and they loaded him onto a plane or chopper to get medevaced out. I swear!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,A very theraputic way of farting and crying at the same time,"It's that funny. If Jaws the Revenge was released say, 70 years ago, it could have been scary to certain standards, but no sequel, certainly not this one, could ever live up to the original classic or better yet, the Peter Benchley book itself. C'mon. Sharks plotting revenge? For no apparent reason against a particular family? It's also very amusing in the way it tries to insert useless cameos and irrelevant flashbacks from the first film in order to spruce up and blind the viewers to what can only be considered a monumental travesty, especially with such a great actor like Michael Caine playing a guy named...Hoagie. Personally, I don't know what was more hideous, the fake shark or Lorraine Gary. Either way, you'll either be severely depressed or immensely amused by what transpires, from the Lifetime-esque opening credits to the painfully bad showdown in the end. DON'T buy it, but hey, it's your dollar. And your conscience."
1,HILERIOUS!!!!,"This is one of the top 10 movies of all time....BECAUSE IT'S SO FREAKEN FUNNY!! (which it isn't supposed to be, which just makes it that much more funny). Jaws was excellent, Jaws 2 was ok, Jaws 3 was a joke, and Jaws: The Revenge was basically a comedy. Loraine Gray plays Ellen Brody again, and takes a vacation to the bahamas, where yet another, a 3rd shark appears and follows her from Amity to the bahamas. That's realistic. And watching old people fall in love is gross. When Ellen Brody has the dream of her being eaten, i laughed my ass off. If you're looking for some good laughs, rent Jaws: The Revenge."
2,Sounds Good But Not,"A 30 foot shark seeking revenge on an event that happened years ago to another shark. Wow, I'd like to know who thought that one up. The original jaws was one of the best movies of all time,jaws 2 was allright but 3 and 4 had no sense of logic. Sharks can't roar and they surly can't travel to the bahamas. This films only saving grace is some of the grusome attacks. And another thing, the dvd's only feature is a trailer, come on, give us our money's worth. I would only recomend this movie for the most hardcore of Jaws fans.Was thi review helpful. YES or NO"
1,this movie is not a real jaws movie at all,the shark in this movie looks soo fake and why is the shark roaring like a dinosaur near the end of the movie sharks do not roar like dinosaurs this movie is also one of the worst movies ever made!!!!!!!!!!!
3,Jaws Fans will watch,"The kids and I are fans of the Jaws movies. The first is the best; the second isn't bad; the 3-D is ...well... you have to be a fan (but the kids like it b/c, as they say, ""it looks so weird floating out there""); the last called the Revenge is okay but you have to be a fan. The kids like the action with the boats and plane."
1,This is the worst film ever made and everyone knows it is,"Jaws the Revenge is so bad that you just want to kill yourself, and say prayers before you die. Believe me you people who love Jaws, don't see this one."
1,if I could give zero stars I would.................,"Possibly the worst film EVER to grace the silver screen. Even, Lorraine Gary admits she took the part for money. Jesus, the shark looked better in 75 then this crap. And a personal vendetta against a family and swim to the bahammas, where it is warm water, Holy sh#t. Were these people having acid flashbacks or smoking dope? Yeah, I caught a catfish, and ate it, now the mother has flattened my tires and trying to invade my home. This is the worst ever. Director Joseph Sargent is now cleaning aisles in porn shops. This sucks, avoid at all means, unless you feel like tossing up your dinner."
3,"""It's not food he's after.""","As awful as everyone says, but definitely good for laughs; and better than the novel in my opinion. Even though it made for a more logical motivation for the shark, the voodoo elements of the novel just complicated the plot unnecessarily. I prefer the straight forward plotline of the movie. Although the film has a lot of visual goofs, like the shark's teeth falling out of its mouth while chomping down on the research boat or the ocean splashing against the ""horizon"" in the final scene, there are some thoughtful moments too, like Ellen, in her grief, using her oven as storage for her pots and pans. Funnier than JAWS 3."
2,Joseph Sargent's Jaws : The Revenge- This Time It's Personal,"This was once again, a dissapointing movie. I went into Blockbuster and rented this to check it out. Actually this movie wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. It starts with Sean Brody(Mitchell Anderson) gets killed by a Great White Shark during Christmas time. We find out that Martin Brody(Roy Scheider) has been dead for years. After Sean's funeral, Ellen Brody(Lorraine Gary) goes to The Bahamas to see her son Michael(Lance Guest) and his wife Carla(Karen Young). She also meets Hoagie(Michael Caine) and falls for him. Michael and his Marine Biologist Partner Jake(Mario Van Peebles) discover a Great White Shark in the ocean and plan to kill it. When Ellen witnesses a shark attack, she goes out to sea to stop this shark once and for all...."
3,An Okay Movie,"I wil start with the bad stuff about the movie and end with the good.I think the worst thng about this movie is the stupid plot. And it could have used more action. But the movie isn't crap. There are some good scenes in here. The beging scene where the youngest Brody is attacked and killed by the great white, and the scene on the beach with the kids on the float.A fair movie if you like to be scaredbut not to the point of turning the movie off. Still I am the kind who will watch just about anything scary that isn't Rated R."
2,Worth it...,"First of all Jaws the revenge (the 4th of the series) obviously can't be compared to the original. So if you can accept that, this DVD is OK. Story line is stupid as the great white shark is seeking revenge at family of the sheriff in the original Jaws. Michael Caine co star. Look out for a scene where Michael Caine just got off the water the water and seconds later his shirt and hair already dried up. Anyway...this DVD is not a complete waste of time. The picture and sound quality are not bad at all."
1,A shark outswims a plane. Can't beat that!,"What can you say about a movie this bad? Ok, the loyalists will now stand up and say - ""no, Jaws 4 is really incredible!""This one is just plain dumb."
5,Awesome horror film!,Jaws is your classic horror film it Scares you because it could actually happen still the best shark movie out there today! Its hard to say who to recommend it for because my 8 year old loves it! :)
3,"Mom, Mom, Mom!","I enjoyed this one more than the previous two. I liked Lorraine's acting as Mrs. Brody struggles with the lost of her son and trying to get on with her life. It's hard. And sometimes, you have to go with that gut instinct too."
1,"For this, Michael Caine couldn't receive his Oscar?",The movie so bad it couldn't even measure up to a theme park ride. Inept filmmaking on an Ed Wood scale. [SPOILER ALERT]: They kill the shark with a flashlight. REALLY?
1,Garbage!,"This is a bad film that is stupid, poor acted, with bad effects, and every other attrocious thing. Do not watch."
2,Jaws #4 - Pretty Bad,The shark does not look real. It looks like a big plastic ballon. The movie has little or no redeeming value. The worst thing is that it gives the public a totally wrong idea of what sharks are all about. Sharks are not monsters. For the most part sharks are no danger to people.
1,Top Five Worst Film Of ALL Time,"Oh I do love reading Amazon reviews!!!! People who give this film more than one star really are having a joke, they surely cannot be serious.The story is ridiculous...shark goes round coast of the US to get its revenge. I was half expecting it to get on the subway and go looking at one stage.The acting is diabolical.And to those of you who said the shark was realistic...are you drunk? Look at the film again, the mechanism under the mechanical shark is CLEARLY visible in many shots. Which again tells you how bad it is.Really, if you thought this was good, I'd reexamine what films you go see.Contender for the worst film of all time with Gigli. In fact so bad, I dont know why I bothered reviewing it AT ALL!"
1,I feel sorry for the shark. And I don't care about this film,"I have the first Jaws on video, widescreen. Beautiful. Spectacular. Amazing. I saw Jaws 2 on TV a few weeks back, and I shrugged my shoulders and thought ""Ah, it's a decent sequel."" Then I saw Jaws 3 (aka Jaws 3-D) and scratched my head. Finally, I got a chance to see Jaws the Revenge at a friends house...and I still don't understand WHY IN THE NAME OF ALL THAT'S GOOD would someone have such a cruel heart as to defile the greatness of Speilberg's masterpiece?! This film is a gross insult to the first Jaws. I feel sorry for Bruce the shark, and it's not just because he has been blown apart, electrocuted, blown apart again, and impaled by a boat!!! It's because he had to star in this WASTE!!! Well, Bruce, I still worship you when I watch the Jaws I have on video, from the time you snack down on the naked girl to the time you bite Quint in half."
1,And this time... its horrible,Wow. This movie is so insanely stupid that I dont know where to start. Lets take an incredibly great movie classic and destroy it with idiotic sequels. 1.Sharks cannot roar. 2.Sharks cannot stand on their tails. 3. When sharks are impaled with large sticks they do not automatically explode. 4.Mama Brody cannot reminice about things she didnt witness. 5.Sharks cannot follow people vast distances. 6.Sharks do not enjoy swimming in warm bahaman waters. 7.Michael Caine shouldnt be in this movie. 8.Sharks do not have feelings. I could really go on forever there. Do not buy or even rent this piece of cinematic garbage
1,This is a Jaws movie?!,"As a HUGE JAWS fan I cry when I watch this! This movie is soooooo bad. You know how they made all of those shark movies after Jaws that are all horrible and all rip offs? Well this one should be in one of those series instead of the JAWS series. Like the ""Shark Attack"" series. No one likes those, please some one take this movie from the JAWS series and put it with Shark Attack. JAWS and JAWS 2 were great. They were believable and every thing in them was humanly possible. a shark standing on its tail so it can get ramed with a end of a boat? Come on! When they shock a shark, it growls like a lion? Please! Oh, and this shark magically knows where Mrs. Brody is going? All the way from Amity Island which is some where in New England to the Bahammas? What the Hell? Any person who defends this movie and thinks that it is even remotly decent doesnt know what they are talking about and should be gobbled up by the shark from the movie!"
1,Lorrain Gary's performance is superb,"Sad to say the film doesn't do this talented actress justice. She later said in an interview, on the E Hollywood True Story of the Making of Jaws, that this sequel wasn't very good at all. In other words even she's upset over this embarressment. Right she should be! It has laughably violent death scenes, grossly uneven elements that don't jibe at all with the previous Jaws films (like how did Sean grow up so fast? he should only be 16 in this film), really outrageous, impossible storyline of a shark bent on revenge, some really bad acting by the rest of the cast with Mario Van Peebles leading the pack with his ultra-ridiculous carribean-biologist-Jake character,much contrived dialogue and the most annoying little girl (Judith Barsi) in film history. Woulda worked better if almost the whole film was only a dream by Ellen Brody (Gary). Hey maybe that's what it really is."
2,"STOP THE SEQUELS, UNLESS THEY'RE GOOD~","One of my friends saw this Jaws movie, before the original, and it ruined Jaws, and the surprisingly good sequel, Jaws 2.Here are just a few things wrong with it.1. People don't reminisce about things they never witnessed.2. Sharks don't get revenge.3. Sharks don't stand on their tales to get a quick bite.4. Sharks don't explode, when stabbed with a sharp bit of boat, and their bodies don't look exactly the same as the orginal Jaws shark.This film totally ruins the name Jaws. Lorraine Gary reprises her role asa widowed Ellen Brody, who travels to the Bahamas with her son Michael, after her other son is killed by a killer Great WHite Shark. From the beginning you might think this is a good movie but it's [bad.] Totally [bad.] Iit must have been a terrible low-point in Michael Caine's career.In conclusion, if you're thinking about making another Jaws movie, stop and think about these words, 'sequels get [worse] each time around!"
3,More big sharks!,"this movie whas ok untill the end.The shark showed himselve a lot more than in the first one.The weird thing with this movie is that the shark could be the devil our something like it couse it search for revenge! It may sound mystic but it is patetic! A big and hungry shark cant thingk that way! One more stange thing with this ""so kalled shark!"" is that it roar! The shark roar like a T.rex oure something and that is impossible! And the most bad thing is that the shark blows up when it get ramed by a boat.Decide for your selve and see it if you have to..but if you not are a fanatic ""Jaws"" fan,i whoud stay back."
1,2 DIFFERENT ENDINGS!??,I saw the film for the first time when it first came out and at the end when Ellen Brody crashes into the shark the front of the boat stabs through it and blood pours out of the shark then the front of the boat breaks off and he sinks.....Now i watch it and it blows up...somehow???? I want to find out where i can get a copy of the Original ending....not a good movie but even worse when the shark blows up. If anyone knows where i can get the original e-mail me please.
3,Good and Bad,"Well, I have mixed feelings about this film. Let me start with the good points. The cast is really good and all do a fine job, the camera work on the film is also the best of the 4 movies. The Bad: A giant (even for a white) shark, that growls and wants revenge? What were the writers smoking when they thought THAT up? The worst part about this movie is the end. It's just really dumb. Frankly, this isn't a great movie, but it's a good way to waste a some time and not be bored"
2,M.F. from south Arkansas.,"This is a O.K. movie the effects were not very believable no shark could jump out of the water like this one did.The acting was decent,it's worth watching once."
1,Only if there was a ZERO stars rating,"This was a stupid film. The plot, acting, special effects, and everything else was was bad! Stay Clear! Jaws 4 is a revenge to those who loved and enjoyed Jaws 1. If you want to see a cool shark movie besides Jaws see Deep Blue Sea..."
3,Better than it's reputation suggests,"Hardly perfect, however I really enjoyed Lorraine Gary's performance and the cameos of characters from the original Jaws including Mrs. Kittner. The Bahama and Caribbean locations are beautiful. It was also fun seeing the ""Amity"" locations again. The shark couldn't look any less real and a lot of the story is pretty silly, however no sillier than films like Independence Day, Armageddon, and countless other block busters. This film has been ridiculed a lot, however it's actually the best of the Jaws sequels."
1,Super Mom versus the big fish!,"What's this, Did they have money left to spend in the current fiscal year? If you are bored and you want to rent a movie better choose that ""Police Academy"" sequel that you haven't seen yet. I would like to watch this movie again because the first time that I watch this film in video Mario Van Peebles survives the attack of the big fish but when it was broadcast on TV he dies, (Are there two versions?) It isn't believable that a widow turns into a seasoned fisherwoman within hours. And this movie, as well as Jaws 3, suffers from the lack of ""Boss"" Brody (the ""soul"" of the ""Jaws"" saga)"
1,The movie that makes godzilla look good,"This so called shark thriller lacks three things plot, dialogue, and complexity. The people of Jaws should have ended this series 2 movies ago. I do not recomend this movie to anyone."
3,"Not a bad film, not a good one","It was nice seeing Lorraine Gary in her most famous role of Mrs.Brody. The only fault with the movie is the shark. Why in the world would the shark stalk the Brody's, a fault with logic. The story would be better, if they would of forget the Brody's and concentrate on a Jaw prequel about the USS Indianapolis. The movie looks wonderful on wide screen and it is worth the $, that I paid for it on dvd."
1,A horrible film!,"By-the-numbers filmaking of the lowest common denominator. An utter discrace; Veteran director, Joseph Sargent, should be ashamed of himself."
5,THE SCARIEST JAWS YET,"What makes the JAWS franchise such a rarity in Hollywood is that each installment has managed to be better than the one that immediately preceded it. JAWS THE REVENGE is no exception. This chapter picks up the story of Sheriff Brody's widow, (played once again by the marvelous Lorraine Gary), who finds herself the intended victim of a vengeful shark who'll stop at nothing to even the score with the comely lass, even following her plane from smalltown Amity to the beaches of the Bahamas. The result is a contemporary shocker with more chills than the first three JAWS put together. Academy Award Winner Michael Caine has never been better."
2,Not for me...,"I got this video in an attempt to learn some new things and some new views on things. Bad plan. For me, anyway. This video didn't present anything at all new. Talks about women needing to feel loved, wanted, nurtured, etc. I was hoping for more elaboration on specific practices, techniques, etc. This video is more of a porn flick with a doctor legitimizing the ""documentary intent"" between scenes.I didn't give this a 1-star rating because it can give some ideas, and maybe a starting point for coming up with your own. It also might not be too bad for those men that have had no prior training or counseling, and straight up have no clue."
1,"5 minutes of instruction, rest is video","The video is very misleading. The video has 7 chapters. The format of each chapter is Dr. Lonnie speaking for a few minutes on the chapter subject, women on the street speaking about the subject and then a lenghty video of a couple engaged in love-making. The subjects are not what you expect, they cover subjects such as, trust, worshiping her, smile,etc. The instruction covers no physical techniques as the video title would lead you to believe. The video of the couples has nothing to do with the subject and there is no instruction as they are engaged. Total rip-off."
5,New Johnny Cash Fan,"I bought this album because I loved the movie ""Walk the Line"". Except for the first song, ""Hey Porter"", which was one of his earliest, and ""A Boy Named Sue"", this is my new favortie album. His deep, soulful voice tells you that his heart is in everything he sings. He wrote most of the songs himself, but even with the ones he didn't you can tell that he understood completely what the composer was trying to say, (i.e.""Ring of Fire"" and ""Sunday Morning Coming Down""). The instrumentation is brilliant (i.e. the Mexican horns in ""Ring of Fire""). Johnny Cash was REAL. Had I paid attention many years ago I would have been a fan of his all along. This is Country and Western Soul."
2,Greatest hits????,I can listen to Johnny Cash as well as the next person but I was disappointed in this album. There are much better albums by him at Amazon than this one. I don't know how Columbia managed to call this a 'Greatest Hits' package because it doesn't touch the surface.
4,Love is a burning thing.,"This is not a Johnny Cash ""Greatest Hits"" album. Rather, it's a collection of singles (a-sides and b-sides), that had not already been on an album. So, some big hits like ""Don't Take Your Guns to Town"" were not included, because they had already been on an album. But, it is still a solid collection of songs. Johnny Cash's fans should enjoy it."
5,A book to read often,My granddaughter loves this book. She picks I'll Always Love You to be read to her over and over. I wondered what she was doing when I saw her lying on the rug with her legs in the air. She was copying baby bear exercising with his mother from the book! A good choice for any toddler.
2,Very Best of Bill Haley,"Very Best of Bill Haley contains all his major hits like Rock around the clock, See you later Alligator and Shake, Rattle and Roll. In my opinion Bill Haley is like listening to a toned down Elvis. Elvis had better lyrics, a more varied sound and most of all he had better vocal skills. Many of these songs sound like different variations of the same melody and that gets tedious after a while. 2/5."
3,DON'T BE MISLED,"David G. Mccullough fans: Pay attention to the author listed here, David W. Mccullough. Notice the W., not a G. (Amazon has it listed among David G.'s books.)David G. Mccullough--Morning on Horseback, John Adams, The Johnstown Flood, etc.This one is David W.--War of the Irish KingsI put 3 stars in because they made me fill something in. Haven't read it yet--a gift. I'm sure it's a good one."
1,I'm not impressed,"Wars of the Irish Kings: A Thousand Years of Struggle, from the Age of Myth through the Reign of Queen Elizabeth II'm not impressed when the cost of the Kindle edition is more than either the hardback but especially the paperback editions. I use the Kindle app for iPOD Touch and it will be getting less and less use as you keep on increasing the cost of Kindle editions.-lad"
4,4.5 stars for this enjoyable gen-x biking story,"Biking on a shoestring budget through the third world to find oneself suggests another mediocre gen-x travelogue, but mr. pham surprises with a book that quietly grows and grows & grows on the reader. The bicycle trip is spiced with enough memories of the fall of Saigon, escaping Vietnam, and dysfunctional immigrant family life starting over in America to keep us non-bikers entertained. his descriptions of bicycling, being an asian American, and a `foreign-vietnamese' are thoughtful and well-done. It's not the great american novel, but it's a well told story worth a read."
2,Very slow book,"I found this book disappointing. The author was unlikeable. It is an autobiography, but I could care less about Pham's personal stories. Although it did get somewhat better towards the end, overall, it was very slow."
1,Bad,"...I think it's very poorly written. I'm trying to read it as quickly as I can now so that I can move onto something better but I'm really struggling to finish it. To mention Pham in the same breath as Kerouac or Theroux is really misleading. He uses adjectives like ""nature-happy"" to describe one character and ""frost-rosy"" to describe a person's eyes. It's all very romantic but it doesn't actually mean anything.Incidentally, I bought the book while I was traveling through Vietnam. I spent a month there and bought the book in my last week before moving onto Cambodia and Thailand. I don't think it represents the country at all well and some portions were downright incorrect, false, and exaggerated.It's just a bad book. Kerouac and Theroux wrote enough good books so that you shouldn't have to read this bad one."
5,A wonderful book...,"I finished this book in three days -- an accomplishment for someone who's a book collector, not a reader.I bought this book ahead of a visit to Vietnam, thinking it would be a good travel guide. It isn't. What it is is a reavealing insight into the psyche of being an Asian-American. It's about life, love, family. Read it."
5,a physical search for an emotional path,"this book is well written and it has a story to tell: andrew's search for his being, his psyche, his goals, his identity...all on a bike trip in vietnam. i went along with him...could feel his anxiety, smell his sweat-reeking clothes, enjoy his sights. above all, this was a wonderful journey although i think his conclusions are inadequate but that is totally meaningless since this his journey, not mine.anybody who has ever searched (i think we all have at one time or another)...read this book."
5,"WOW-Moving, refreshingly insightful, yet humorous and poetic","In short, Andrew Pham's memoir spans many levels: travelogue, insight into Vietnam's Communist imprisonment, the heart/mind of a Vietnam War Vet, Vietnamese people/culture, Vietnamese American returning to the homeland, honestly telling portrait of a Vietnamese American dysfunctional family, and captivating examination of one's psche and the external factors that define it. Wonderfully engaging read!"
5,A beautifully wrought return to one's complicated past,"This book embraces so many themes, so delicately, wrenchingly and compassionately. The center plot is a return to Vietnam by a young Vietnamese American which his family fled years ago to live in the United States. However, it is far beyond cross-cultural travelogue; it inhabits the American as well as the Asian psyche with such scary acuity, and takes us into an inner landscape where few can go....without this author as guide. The prose is elegant and luminous; the situations tragic, comic, ludicrous; terrifying. The tone I felt was one of battle fatigue but transcended by unrelenting steel: this one was meant to survive and to tell it all....."
5,More than a 'travel' book,"As with Joseph Conrad and Ayn Rand, Andrew X Pham has taken English as a second language and come to command it as only a few select native speakers ever have. In addition, the subject matter - an attempt to 'go home again' - is likely to intrigue a wide audience, from travellers, adventurers and dreamers to anthropologists, war veterans, artists, poets and freedom-lovers. Don't miss it!"
5,Excellent Book,"I'm leaving in a a few weeks on a biking vacation to Vietnam. I picked up this book after reading other customer reviews on amazon.com.Catfish and Mandala is an excellent book. Pham's writing is intense and very interesting. It is one of those books you stay up all night to finish, despite having to be to work early the next morning.His book discusses a lot of the corruption that occurs for tourists of Vietnam. Although it made me a little apprehensive of my upcoming trip, being aware is much better than being naive."
3,Not what I expected,"I'd read several 5-star reviews of this book and was eagerly looking forward to reading it. But I came away strangely disappointed. It's not that it wasn't a good book; it's just not what I expected.If a reader hopes to get a feeling for the present day Vietnam, this is probably not the book to begin with. As a returning Vietnamese who left his country as a 10 yo after it fell to the Communists, the author experiences almost exclusively the underbelly of the culture and sees little to praise.As a vehicle for exploring his own conflicted relationship with his parents, siblings, extended family, and his own identity, it works well.As a source for learning more about the length, width, and most of all the depth of Vietnam, it is less successful."
4,A real reflection of Vietnamese American and East-West,"I found myself related closely to the book, not because of the dramatic of the story, but because of the experience that Vietnamese Americans have had... I found the truth revealed in many scence that Andrew described... This book actually recalled many memories for me... I also suprised that, with limited experience (was pretty young when Anh An left Vietnam), that he can bring out a lively pictures of reality in Vietnam. Identity... Somehow people like An and myself found that it is hard to believe, what a culture conflict could result such emotion... Thanks for the great work, Anh An."
2,from a Vietnamese reader's perspective,"The book, over all, is a disappointment. It has a very condescending tone and attitude towards Viet Nam and its people. Granted that it is the author's experience in VN, but he writes it with an American audience in mind, so in the end, he is willing to trash his birth country to let his audience know that his true home is still America. He compares VN to a prostitute on a few occasions, and similar to how a hooker is abandoned after she is used, he, too, abandons (metaphorically as well as literally) VN after it provides him with the necessary backdrop for and backbone of his book. The book, if read in bits and pieces, can be interesting, but beyond that it lacks a persuasive sincerity ."
3,too dramatizing,"Overall the book is a good read, but it is too dramatizing and doesn't deserve a five star. Andrew X. Pham in this book is over-making his effort by turning many nouns into verbs and using big words when it is unnecessary. The story is good, although not one hundred percent factual, because all of Vietnam as described in the book is so poor and corrupted, but in reality, Vietnam is more deserving than its description."
2,"Cannot lend this book even though it is listed as ""lending enabled""","I just don't get it. This book was loaned to me. I went to accept the loan, and a message comes up that the book is ""not available to customers in the U.S.""Why then, can this ""U.S. customer"" sample the book, and even BUY the book, but cannot accept this book being loaned to me? The kindle version is listed as ""LENDING ENABLED"" period. I would like to be able to receive this book on loan as advertised by Amazon. If it is not available to loan to ""certain customers"" this should be listed in the description. Amazon needs to fix this."
2,Good Book but hard to read,I liked this book but it could have been a little shorter and more interesting. I'm in the 8th grade and i don't read a lot but i liked this book.
3,Drunken Losers,I was really interested in reading about cycling through Vietnam; but who cares how much Pham and his so-called friends drink or how sick they get. They are disgusting drunks. I gave it three stars because when he's writing about Vietnam or his family the book is very interesting.
4,A journey back to Vietnam,"An interesting story of a young man's return to Vietnam after college and after working as an engineer. The book was not always easy to read with its graphic descriptions of a number of eating experiences, but the reader could feel like she/he was right there making the trip along with the author."
4,Looking for your roots,"Beautiful writer. Very interesting story but I wish it had left me with a better view of the Vietnamese....particularly the men and the country and the government. The author was quite cynical but, probably, because he was disappointed and disalusioned. He is very honest in his intropections and in his descriptions. I wish it had been a happier story. A culture that thinks caning is the best punishment is hard to agree with."
5,Read while traveling in Vietnam,This book was riveting and greatly added to my understanding of the Vietnamese people (living in the US and Vietnam) and their recent history. Highly recommend and you don't need to read it while in Vietnam!
1,Disappointing,"The machine worked wonderfully for 10 days and then died. Blinking green light, won't even prime fully anymore."
1,No Coffee from Mr. Coffee -- And Poor Product Support!,"Did not get even 1 cup out of this machine. Mr. Coffee promised to send a replacement, but I am still waiting three weeks after calling their support line. If you are shopping for a pod-style coffee maker -- choose another brand. This one was a disappointment."
4,"Nice, for a quick cup of coffee.","I received the Mr. Coffee Home Cafe as a gift. I already owned a pod machine that was a ""free"" gift from a subscription coffee supplier, but I prefer the Mr. Coffee system. Mr. Coffee takes up less space, it's a lot quieter and brews a more consistent cup of coffee (the French Roast is very tasty).For 1 or 2 cups of coffee it's a great machine, but for 4 or more cups I'll switch to my 12 cup drip brewer.So far, I haven't had any problems from it. I was confused about the priming. The priming directions called for an 8oz cup, so I thought the priming was supposed to fill the cup with water. It doesn't. After a few tries, I realized if there's water coming out of the spout, it's primed and ready to brew."
3,Its OK...but I went back to my 12 cup machine,"I was really excited to get this machine...It was easy to get started right out of the box and offered a variety of selections of flavors and hot beverages. I have found that the coffee is generally weak (to my standards) and requires that I use a ""double"" pod in order to get my desired strength. As for conveniences, its true that it doesn't take up a lot of space, and if you just want 1 cup of fresh hot coffee, its right there! So I have mixed feelings about the machine."
4,Still the Best Out There,"I've had this coffee maker for 5 or 6 years and the spout falls off if you bump it, it leaks water on every cup, the drip tray is not dish washer safe and will melt a bit if it's on the lower shelf, but the funny thing is, even with all the problems it still makes a great cup of coffee. There are days I make 5 or 6 cups of coffee! I just started looking for a replacement and there doesn't seem to be anything as well thought out as this unit; large water reserve that can be rotated to the either side of the maker, accommodates short or tall cups and one button pushing for what ever size you want. What's a pod lover to do."
3,King of polka?,"This is a re-issue of Elvis' early 1960's international hit single ""Wooden Heart"". The song was a big hit almost everywhere but the US, where it was released as a B-side but failed to chart, no doubt due to the fact that its polka influenced sound just did not catch-on with American teenagers. This release includes the orginal B-side ""Puppet On A String"" (which was the A-side in the US and was a hit peeking at 14 on the US singles chart). The single would eventually be certified GOLD in the US by the RIAA. Also included is the bonus track ""Tonight Is So Right For Love"". This is for Elvis collectors only."
1,Disappointing!,I ordered this bag to make a gift for a future bride. I am so disappointed with how cheap and flimsy it is. This is a small step up from the $1 reusable shopping bags they sell in grocery stores. I don't think I will be giving this as a gift.
5,"A bumbling antihero, stumbling through the great events of the century","This is a story of Walter Starbuck, WASPified son of immigrants, who, pushed along by various forces outside his control, attains a brief taste of the American Dream (TM), loses it all, gets it all back with a bonus, then loses it all again. It's told with great humor, a sharp wit, and a stinging criticism of government and capitalism."
3,100 Words or Less,"This back shelf novel has some good Vonnegut moments, but overall it falls a bit flat. That's the problem with great writers ... it's near impossible to excel with every project."
5,GREAT Vonnegut!!,"A Vonnegut classic--fast paced, bizarre and mesmerizing. The story follows the unlikely meanderings of the usual Vonnegut-type central character, a hapless but guileless doofus just released from jail. His wanderings create a dose of social commentary on corporate America and national politics as only Vonnegut can. Mix the style of JD Salinger with the imagination of Salvador Dali and you've got ""Jailbird."" This novel is short, fast paced and every bit as addictive as the author's previous novels (better than his later ones). If you think you would like dark humor embedded in social satire with more than a touch of the surreal, you'll LOVE ""Jailbird"" by Kurt Vonnegut (the master of the art form). Read it!"
3,Only three stars because I'm tough (but fair I hope),"If you are planning to attend Harvard, this is a must read! Don't commit to attend or pay tuition before you enjoy this book."
3,Not up to his usual standard,"Maybe I just wasn't in the right mood for this one. Vonnegut's deceptively simple prose was up to snuff and I was frequently amused by a well-turned phrase or unexpected observation. However, it too often came off like a by-the-numbers Vonnegut pastiche--yet another world-weary, ineffectual, passive observer wandering through a world of failure and hypocrisy."
4,The Standard Vonnegut,Vonnegut has done it once again for the fans of his work. his humor is clever and it shows. this may see a little but dry however for the first time reader. definetly a must read for the avid Vonnegut fan.
3,Pretty Good.,"An enjoyable book though confusing when fiction is mixed with historical characters. It's always challenging and entertaining to figure out where in time you've been taken throughout the book. Not as good as Slaughterhouse V, but still good. I read it in about 3 or 4 minutes. I'd probably enjoy the book the second time around."
5,Awesome DVD,"I'm writing a novel based during the Great Quake, and this DVD just gave me so much information and inspiration. I'm so glad I bought it. I'm sure to be watching it often as I progress with the book."
5,History of San Francisco,"I saw this on TV before and wanted to own it, and now I do. Great piece of American history made available to everyone."
5,Lin Carter was the best!,"I first read the Calisto series twenty-five years ago when I was a teen ager. I am currently re-reading the books to my twelve year old son (he's a remarkably good reader, but he still loves to be read to --who doesn't) and am delighted to say that he is as enthralled by the adventures of Jonathan Andrew Dark as I was so long ago. These books aren't high art or particuarly thought provoking, but if you allow yourself to suspend your disbelief a bit, the pay off these books will give you is well worth the effort. A princess to be rescued and a kingdom to be won! Who could ask for more from a read."
5,Great Bag & Great Price,Excellent bag with 14 hole organizer and putter sleeve holder. Lightweight cart bag with numerous pockets. Highly recommend.
2,disappointing product,"I received my pipes dented and with scratches. The triple wall chimney pipe has a extreme thin galvanized layer and is prone to rust. I hate the way the pipes are connected. It really looks unprofessional. This was a great disappointment. Honestly,for the same price you can get a much sturdier and better looking product."
4,Tatie Danielle,This is one of the greatest foreign films around. It's a dark comedy with a typically French Flair. We first saw this film on the Sundance Channel and decided we had to own it. Finding a DVD of it in America is impossible so we purchased the used VHS version at Amazon and converted it to a DVD. If you can deal with subtitles.......you will love this film.
2,Unpleasant,"I feel sorry for the nice family of Tatie E, the victims of the nasty aunt; and i feel sorry for the dog that gets abandoned, and i feel sorry for myself for watching this questionable dark comedy."
1,No wonder the French like watching American movies.,"I can't believe I have to give it at least one star. There should be an option for no stars. I am a high school student who had to watch this terrible movie in my French class. Please save your students the pain of watching this!! I would have much rather done grammer exercises or translated sentences. I can't understand how the other people who wrote reviews could think it was hysterically funny. I didn't laugh once because it was so dumb. I DO NOT enjoy seeing animals being kicked or abandoned. I was bored out of my mind watching this movie. It was all I could to keep awake. After watching this, I can understand why the French watch dubbed American movies."
4,eye-opening economic perspective,"Blinder will have you sitting beside yourself as he challenges the public's vastly preconceived notions of the economic world. One chapter in particular draws my attention, ""Who Will Protect Us From Protectionism."" Although there are minor flaws in his analysis, due to recent revelations in economic free trade policy, Blinder exercises a practicality that wonderfully illustrates the need to revamp our protectionist policy. This book is a must read if you are still mislead by the notion that protectionism levels the playing field and increases American welfare."
3,Required Reading,"I had to read this book to take AP Macroeconomics when I was 17. I could only read ten pages at a time as it bored me to tears. It didn't help with the course at all, and the teacher never tested us on it, but I learned a bit."
1,"Was this The Quiet Man, or The Wife Beater?","I'm not sure which part I liked better...when John Wayne caught a strange woman in his house and forced her to kiss him, or when he drug his wife by the arm and, alternately, the collar, for five miles with the entire town in tow. Or maybe it was when it looked like he was going to rape her on their wedding night, but just through her on the bed, instead. This may have been the culture then, or maybe I'm taking it too seriously, but wow. He always seems to be rather rough with women, but this was not what I expected from John Wayne's ""best movie ever."""
2,Worse Than a Postcard,"John Ford, the mythical Irishman, finally had an opportunity to make a film in Ireland. Then he made what is probably the most ridiculous mis-representations of Ireland on film. For anyone who is Irish-American, and who actually knows anything about Ireland, Ford's film is a painful travesty of all things Irish. And yet every St. Patrick's Day, this awful movie is held up as some sort of representation.... There went the luck of the Irish. Thanks to that old-fogey hack John Ford. ""Give Ireland back to the Irish,"" or so goes the old rebel song...."
2,Original was Great but ......,"The original movie (Black & White) was great but this is a prime example of why ""colorization"" should be made illegal. The DVD quality is poor at best and the colorization (both DVD & VHS) is so poor that your attention is distracted from the wonderful story line & fine acting. We the buying/viewing public should demand a quality black & white version !"
3,"GREAT FILM, BUT PICTURE QUALITY SO-SO","THIS IS A GREAT MOVIE BUT THIS TRANSFER IS NOT THE BEST. THERE IS A SERIOUS LACK OF SHARPNESS, BUT THIS IS SADLY COMMON IN COPIES OF OLDER FILMS."
5,A Great Movie,"We bought The Quiet Man Collector's Edition. The quality was excellent. The color was beautiful. The movie itself was very entertaining, though Maureen O'Hara was a bit too dramatic. This movie is well worth having."
2,The Quiet Man (collector's edition),Watched the movie half the way through and then it froze. Would not start again. We were very upset with the movie.
5,The Quiet Man,Bought this for my elderly Mom since it is a true classic. She watched it 5 times on St. Patrick's Day and a few times before and after. It brings one back in time and to the era of early Hollywood. John Wayne/Maureen O'Hara classic and start of many of their shared films
4,Wayne the non cowboy.,The Quiet Man is obviously a very successful departure from the usual cowboy roles. This movie is a delight from begining to end. Maureen O'Hara is terrific as JW's love intrest. If you are a John Wayne fan and this DVD is not in your; you better get it.
5,"DVD alert - great movie, BUT....","The transfer is terrible, especially on the alleged ""collectors edition."" One of the worst I've ever seen actually. Somebody thought the Irish countryside was so pretty they amped up the hue and contrast making much of what you see blurred and overcolored. Too bad, fans deserve better. And no Dolby either, just enhanced sound,,,whatever the hell that is?BTW, they are ALL like this. If you want your own copy you're better off taping it from an AMC/TCM broadcast. The VHS version ain't all that hot either.""Have the good manners not to hit the man until he's your husband and entitled to hit you back."" haw haw haw"
2,"Excellent, timeless movie - baaaad DVD","The movie is one of the timeless classics. You can watch it a thousand times and it will never bore you. There's a chemistry between John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara that makes you think this romance is real, not played. But, and now comes the sad part of the story, this DVD is a joke. Rent it, but keep your hands off it when you think about buying it. The quality is bad, real bad!!!!"
3,"Classic film, but a poor DVD transfer","Quiet Man is one of my all time favorites, but the DVD version left alot to be desired. The film quality is closer to VHS, if even that good. The only 'feature' was a ""The Making of..."" special, which is also available on the VHS version.A great film, but a very disappointing DVD entry."
1,Stay Away,"Though ""The Quiet Man"" is one of my favorite movies, the DVD is the worst in my collection. The backgrounds are washed out and it's out of sync in several scenes. I can't watch it. It's so bad, I won't sell it.Hopefully, a remastered version is on the books. It's a delightful film, to see ""The Quite Man"" treated so badly is a disservice and a shame."
3,"Terrific movie, lousy picture quality","This movie was one of John Ford's most personal, and he struggled to find the funding to do it since the studios saw this as ""just another love story"". ""The Quiet Man"" is a fantastic love story, with wonderful scenes (the famous ""windy kiss""), classic lines, and snappy humor.Be warned, however, that even in the ""Collector's Edition"" DVD, the picture quality is terrible, especially if compared with the restored ""Singin' in the Rain"", which was released the same year. It is grainy and sometimes blurry, and the color vacillates in intensity. Compared with other Special or Collector's Edition DVDs of classic movies, this one was truly a disappointment."
1,The Quiet Man,"This and Robin Hood were two of the very few films I've had an irrational desire to actually own rather than simply rent. I read the earlier reviews with care, and thought I was getting a good copy, but this Collector's Edition seems to have been the one copied from a poor VHS tape. I am perplexed how it can even be sold. Maybe one day it will come out in a revived copy, in which case I will buy it again."
5,One of the best movies ever!,"This is one of the best movies ever! The product arrived and performs exactly as advertised. I have found that on average, delivery takes a little longer when using the Amazon third-party providers."
2,2 Stars For Poor Quality DVD. Great Movie.,"I have read in another review that the ""John Wayne Collection"" edition of this DVD is of poor picture quality. I have the ""Collector's Eddition"", and the picture quality is terrible on this one as well.This is a great movie, a classic. It was filmed beautifully in Ireland and deserves better then this. I hope the studio will one day give this outstanding movie the treatment it deserves."
1,Quiet Man Collectors Edition - Awful video quality,"Just took delivery of the Quiet Man - Collector's Edition. There are several warnings about which edition to buy - most say the John Wayne Edition is to be avoided altogether. I took deliverey of the Collector's Edition. Showing on a DVD/Blue-Ray high end player on a 55"" Phillips 1080 flat screen. VIDEO QUALITY IS AWFUL. Low resolution causes the images to be pixilated and blurry. Amazingly dissapointing. Do not buy this DVD unless you are a huge Quiet Man fan and are willing to put up with the terrible video quality OR can run on a small screen (14"" or so)."
2,"the movie is great, the dvd is not",This Dvd is labled as a collector's edition so I had hoped that it would be superior to the copy I bought some years ago. It is not. The movie is fuzzy and faded and badly in need of restoration.
2,Blu ray done right please.,"THE QUIET MAN is my all time favorite John Wayne movie. It is also one of the most beautiful movies ever put to film. Of course, you wouldn't know that, from the horrifying job done on the previous DVD transfer. If ever a movie needed and deserved a make-over, its THE QUIET MAN. Someone please get to work restoring this. We fans would love to see something along the lines of a BEN HUR restoration. I've read online that a 2K copy exists (somewhere). Films like this are national treasures, and should be treated as such. Maybe, the persons owning the video rights are being jerkish. No idea why we haven't seen this 5 star film with a decent treatment. As others have stated, the DVD for THE QUIET MAN, looks like a straight copy from a VHS tape. The only time I can even stand to watch this is when its Turner Classic Movies. (Ted, send me a copy)...Seriously, don't bother with either of the DVDs floating around out there. Just wait for the BLU RAY or keep your eye on TCM."
2,The Quiet Man,The DVD quality is inferior to the VHS quality... This came as a big surprise ...The screen for the entire movie is very dark.
5,Wonderful.,"Timeless and very entertaining John Ford classic and maybe the WORST DVD of all time!This DVD is impossible to watch...period. The people responsible for this mess should be jailed, I'm serious. Better to watch this on AMC or Turner Classics than to try to sit through this kaleidoscope of bad editing.C'mon guys, get with the program. All you have to do is read the multitude of bad reviews here to know how screwed up this DVD release is."
2,Classic John Wayne,"I have had this DVD for about 3 or 4 years, I bought it from Amazon, and have never been happy with the video portion of it. As someone else said, the VHS tape has better quality. What was even more disturbing to me is something I just discovered. It shows the ""CC"" symbol for closed captioning and also spells it out in the special features block on the back of the case. When a hearing impaired friend recently wanted to watch it and needed the captions they were not there. We tried for over an hour to find a way to get them to display and if they are on the DVD the link to them is broken. Under the Audio category off of the main menu they are not listed. How an outfit like Artisian ever got hold of a classic movie like this one I don't know. What they have done is false advertising where the closed captioning is concerned but what they have done with a wonderful classic movie is even more criminal."
3,Poor Quality,"The Quiet Man is probably my all-time favorite movie. However, I was so disappointed with the quality of the DVD and with Amazon's quality control. The video image on the DVD was as if it had been made from a home made VHS tape. I will keep the movie because I have no other option for owning a copy and will deal with the very poor video image. If you purchase this movie, be willing to accept a very poorly reproduced DVD. It should be embarassing to the company to label this DVD ""Collector's Edition!"""
1,Beware the Ides of March,Poor DVD transfer. Not worth ten cents. Stick with the VHS until this movie is reissued in a better edition.
2,Disappointing for DVD,"If you want this DVD, get the VHS video. It is the same thing. Why they did not use widescreen, I do not know. The Irish scenery alone screams for widescreen. Production value is the same as the VHS. And the beautiful soundtrack is in mono. There is no gain to go to DVD. It gets 2 stars because of the two stars, no other reason."
1,willn't play,"i know this film well already, love it, just the thing for a cold wet day baking, i want on dvd, pop it in to play one wet day when i'm off work sick and it will not play! just says ""wrong region"" what does that mean? it's a DVD, how does it even know its half way around the world. don't know what to do about it or how ot fix it."
2,"The movie is great; the DVD is grainy, sound is just ok","Everyone knows the movie itself is a classic. The quality of the DVD is not so great, the sound is ok, nothing special. Neither videophile nor audiophile will be impressed with the quality or fidelity. But it's good to own the movie in any form before original prints deteriorate further."
2,The Quiet Man Undone,"Watching The Quiet Man on St. Patricks Day is a family tradition. First, my grandfather then my father and then myself would watch it on TV every March 17th. The characters and the story are wonderful and will never change no matter how badly the movie is transferred to DVD. But, this movie has been horribly transferred to DVD. I am hoping the visual beauty of the film and the Irish countryside will be returned someday in a blu-ray version of this magnificent film."
5,"Colorization of ""The Quiet Man""","Reviewer 2294 has indicated that the original of this film was in B&W. It's my understanding that the original was shot in the old three-strip Technicolor process; therefore requiring no colorization; per a recent program on American Movie Classics, Bob Gitt of the UCLA Film and TV Archive has recently completed a restoration of ""The Quiet Man""; have no info. on whether or when this version will make it to VHS/DVD"
2,AUDIO TRACK OUT OF SYNC!,"Of course the 2 star rating is for the DVD transfer, not the movie, which is one of John Ford's and Wayne's best, but it seems all the other bad reviews spend so much time commenting on the poor picture quality that no one seems to have noticed the entire audio track is out of sync!! It's noticeable throughout, particularly when characters speak quickly. I gave a 2 rating instead of 1 (but would prefer 1.5) because, although the transfer is not good, many of the shots retain their beauty - particularly the landscapes. Where the problem arises is in the red and facial tones. Terrible. Still, the movie is so good, I laughed out loud many times. ""Impetuous! Homeric!"""
1,The Quiet Man,"You people have got to be joking haven't you? You sent me the DVD ""The Quiet Man"" which was not formated to Australia's PAL 4 region and, instead was Region 1 ... you apologise for the mistake and then advise me to keep it rather than pay costs of returning it to you ... which I was very grateful for - then you send me this review request. Are your departments actually going to try working TOGETHER one of these days, pilgrim?"
3,Movie is GREAT! Dvd is sadddd!!!,Every1 knows the story by now & it's one of my all-time favorite films. They say it's in its original 'theatrical release version' but that should mean widescreen or letterbox for you old-timers. I WILL NOT BUY THIS FILM AGAIN UNTIL IT'S RELEASED AS A WIDESCREEN EDITION!! The sweeping landscapes demand this and so do I. Stay away from this title until they FINALLY do it right once & for all!!
1,this is a copy,"this was not a good purchase...The Quiet Man was a copied DVD. I was very dissappointed. I also ordered another movie, and it was fine. but the QuietMan DVD was not good."
1,Quiet Man,"I love this movie, but the dvd copy I got is so grainy, should have kept my vhs copy, the picture was awesome."
1,QUIETMAN VIDEO POOR QUALITY,"I bought this new DVD of the Quiet Man hoping to get much improved picture quality over my old VHS tape copy of the Quiet Man. Picture quality is still dismal, thought with remastering would be a vast improvement, instead turned out to be a total waste of money"
3,Price???,"I bought the Collector's Edition 2 years ago for $10.99 and it was distributed by Artisan Home Entertainment. I seen now the price is $21.99 and distributed by Paradise. That is an awful big increase from two years ago. Don't know anything about Paradise, but the distribution by Artisan was absolutely wonderful."
3,The Quiet Man DVD,"I know and love this film, but the quality of the DVD was a bit off. In some scenes the actors motions seemed speeded up as though the copy was created by a nonprofessional. This may be a pirated version. Purchased via Amazon."
2,Wrong format,Was trying to buy a DVD. Entered a search for a DVD of the Quiet Man. Screen posted a list of options and I clicked on one. When it arrived it wasn't a DVD but a VHS and one of very poor quality even though it was unused.
5,Excellent,Perfect condition sent in a timely fashion. I could not have asked for a better product and vendor. Thank you!
1,dachmuse,"What a travesty of a DVD transfer!?!?Here I am expecting to watch a lush restoration of one of the great films from one of the greatest American Filmmakers (had I read the reviews I would have thought twice of buying it for sure!) and I get a shoddy transfer probably done straight from video. These imbeciles at Artisan oughtta be fired, tarred and feathered!Collector's edition my eye! ""Pappy"" & ""Duke"" must be doin' backflips in their graves! Even with this major imperfection, it is still a great story and a pleasure to see a great filmmaker at the height of his powers. Still I hope one day that someone gives us a DVD worth the material.Damn shame."
1,immensly dissatisfied,The picture quality of this DVD transfer is such an absolute disaster that I feel I should be entitled to get my money back.I am not a rich man and so I don't like throwing my money away on garbage! I will never watch this DVD because it is an eye sore.
1,Wait for the UCLA restoration to be released,"One of the greatest movies of all time (AFI and others agree), but ....The quality of ALL the existing DVD versions in the marketplace are far inferior to even the print used in repeated airings by Turner Classic Movies (TCM).Several years ago, the UCLA film restoration geniuses created a wonderful new print from the originals that has been seen in Los Angeles and Ireland.The ownership of the home video rights has passed through several corporate hands. Right now, Lions Gate owns these rights. Until such time as a Blu-Ray version comes out using the UCLA restoration, I would avoid buying this movie on DVD and simply watch the superior version shown by TCM."
2,"Great movie, but terrible transfer to DVD by Republic","Rent before you buy. Apparently Republic allowed their master copy of this great film to deteriorate, and now they've transferred it to DVD without any attempt to restore the original quality. Those of us who remember the beauty of the original were shocked to see the lack of resolution and quality of picture and sound that Republic has been willing to transfer to DVD. Certainly I will be more careful in the future if I pick up anything with the Republic logo! Their credibility has taken a beating with this release!"
1,Poor and cheap digital transfer,"I am not rating the movie, which is good, but be aware that the digital transfer and the color are a disgrace. It is very difficult to follow the interior scenes. Stay away of this issue."
1,"Wonderful movie, no close captioning and fuzzy. Needs restoration!","Please someone consider digitizing this movie to a clear picture that isn't fuzzy, close captioning it as promised, and perhaps putting this on Blu Ray. We know that this movie was done prior to any of these wonderful new technologies, but as an important classic that this movie is, is worthwhile cleaning it up, making it worthy of the audience who adore this film. After all, there is a full tourism trade in the area that the movie was filmed based on people's love of this film, and to honor the fantastic actors/actresses who made this film special.Even more deceptive is that fact the shells claims in two places (on the rear panel) that there is close captioning. This is very important for many people who are hard of hearing, not to mention to allow accessibility, that has been made available to the public since 1986. Let's do this right, folks, really. There is such a love of this film, just honor what you say you'd do. Thank you."
2,Poor Quality Picture,"Great story, and super cast and director. The transfer of this film to dvd is a diservice to this fine picture. I was not happy with what I think was a beautiful story with a real Irish background. Do not buy this edition, wait till it is remastered"
2,Collector's Edition DVD still lousy,"This new DVD version is still unacceptable. The source print is scratchy, the colours bleed and shift (watching the shifting green shades in the opening scene on the train platform is enough to make you seasick), the focus is soft, and the excessive compression has resulted in annoying ""mosquito"" visual noise. A major disappointment.On a positive note, the additional special features (new to this version of the DVD) are interesting and worthwhile. Otherwise, buyer beware!"
1,Save your money for a good DVD.,"I should have entered zero stars for the ""Collector's Edition"" DVD Artisan.Great film, wonderful story. ***** for the real film.But ... this DVD is not as good as a badly colorized B&W; film.Completely junk. The box reads ""Original Theatrical Version"" but the DVD is 4:3; not even 35mm aspect ratio.If you care about this film, save your money and demand a qualityrelease."
1,Poor dvd,Simply want to say it is one awesome movie. But the dvd transfer is terrible. Be careful of what would you buy
1,Disappointing,"Great movie, absolutely terrible transfer. Stay away from this! This is the latest of many copies I've bought for my wife looking for a good transfer. This isn't it!"
5,The Quiet man,"Great movie. Husband loved the Christmas presets, he is a John Wayne movie collector. Still looking for more. Try them"
2,Quality is horrible,"All I can say is -- my 20 year old VHS tape is better quality (and full screen, no less)."
1,Terrible DVD,"I love the film. I won't go into the film because I can't fault the film. I CAN fault whoever transferred this film to DVD. The picture quality is horrible. I had to change the settings on my television just so the actors were in colors that are found in nature. But the picture was blurry, there were skips and on occasion magenta splotches would show up, particularly in the portion leading up to the fight. I had a VHS edition that was better than this travesty."
5,So funny!,"Another light-hearted movie that's super cute! My husband even liked it and he usually only watches action. Who doesn't love watching a husband getting all frustrated over his immature, naughty wife! And my does she get hers! lol"
1,A Great Movie - A Dreadful DVD,The Quiet Man is in every way a great film. Good script. Fine performances. Wit. Beautiful countryside. But this disc is absolutely dreadful. Poor color. Grainy image. I know of none worse. SO disappointing!
1,miserable,"I never received the product. I e-mailed the company, dvdlegacy, and never received a response. The charge still shows on my credit card bill, which I will dispute, and I will never buy anything from this company again."
1,Never Received,"Worst company I ever dealt with. E-mailed, phoned and still no response. I strongly suggest to stay away from DVD Legacy."
1,You have GOT to be kidding me,"I'm a huge fan of the movie itself and have owned the VHS of it for years. Having just built a custom home theater in my basement and being in the business of custom home electronics installation (theaters, audio, smart home integration) I have very high standards for audio and video quality.I'm going to write Artisan a letter, especially after seeing all the other rightfully negative reviews of this DVD. This is by far the worst quality video reproduction I have ever seen, be it laserdisc, VHS, or DVD. Hopefully, some of you unknowingly bought this debacle will do the same, and perhaps something will come of it from ArtiSCAM Home Entertainment."
3,Why?,"I agree whole heartedly that the print used in this new collector's edition is [not good] The sound is acceptable, but where is the quality picture? Why do companies continue to place unacceptable versions on DVD? ... I have a VHS copy from AMC or TCM that has a much better picture. GET THIS MOVIE RIGHT, PLEASE!!!It's a great classic and should be treated as such. I will purchase this again if this is done."
2,poor quality DVD,"I agree with others that this beloved movie, along with ""McClintock!"", was transferred in *dreadful* manner to DVD, and would urge readers to keep or buy VHS (not Good Times version)instead of DVD. That said, I did love the special feature on ""Quiet Man"", where they talk about the movie and people in it... it alone made ""QM"" worth it's $9.95 price I paid for it... so what did she whisper in his ear? But am certianly glad I watched the DVD first, before I just went and threw out my VHS tape!"
3,"Same reviews for multiple items, why?",Why does Amazon lump the reviews together with the same title of movie but clearly not the same DVD product? The reviews for this item is that same as if you check out the reviews for ASIN: B00006JMRD. They are clearly different and also have different release dates. So when the reviewer states terrible digital transfer which item are they suffering to? Since I don't know I will not be purchasing either of these. Get it together Amazon.
5,One of my all time favorite movies!,"The story is wonderfully local and heartwarming, and yet there is a 8 or 9 minute fight scene upon which the movie pivots; yet even that is somewhat comedic. Returning home, finding love, fighting for that love, pride and common sense are all values depicted artfully and entertainingly. - jk"
5,What can I say? The greatest Wayne movie ever made.,"This one is a pure favorite, and can make anyone whose not Irish wish they were. With Ford and Wayne's group of regular co-stars like Maureen O'Hara and Ward Bond, this movie just shines, and you'll be laughing at the end. Get this one if you don't want to wait until the next St. Patrick's Day to see it on TV."
5,Wonderful,This has been one of my favorite John Wayne movies. I had it on VHS and wanted to add it to my DVD collection. But I had put it off due to all the negative reviews regarding the transfer and the poor quality of this edition. I finally decided to order it and I'm glad I did. I didn't notice any negative aspects to the video quality. 5 stars for the movie AND the DVD itself.
4,Look for an early edition,"I already wrote a review of this movie but by reading the other reviews I'm wondering what happened after Artisan re-release this title. First of all, I bought my copy the week it was release for the first time, in 1998 I think. The look of the front art is a little different from the one they are selling now, there is no black contour and the background color behind the image of John Wayne and Maureen embrassing is a soft grey. I'm writing this because my copy is not that bad, it's blurry in some places but like I said in my review, some exterior scenes are clear and gorgeous. The audio is not great but everything is in sink with the action. I don't know if it's because I bought it when it was released or because I bought it in Canada (I don't believe so cause I think our stock comes from the states) but anyway if you can try to find an early edition DVD copy, maybe you won't find it that bad."
1,mistake to order,"I did not realize it was in German, I thought it was in English, but apparently there was a code.. I could have returned it, but it would have cost me about $7 to return something I paid $13 for."
1,Thanks to everyone who reviewed this film for the WARNING!!,"When I got the impulse to search for 'The Quiet Man' on DVD, one of my favourite films of all time, my excitement quickly evaporated after reading only a few customer reviews. Sadly it seems Artisan does not view the importance of this John Ford film or their reputation as a company to be trusted to produce high quality products. I know I will look with scepticism at any other film to DVD transfers done by this company.Thank you to every one who honestly described the quality of the film transfer. I'll have to be happy with my VHS copy until it can be done with the respect it deserves."
1,the WORST DVD transfer I have ever seen ZERO stars !!!,"a FIVE PLUS star movie gets the shoddiest transfer I have EVER seen......The documentary details the extra expense they went through to shoot in Ireland and bring Technocolor crews over from the UK...so I know Ford and company produced a fine product but you'd think this was an 8mm film by the looks of this DVD...truly a crime against all film lovers. Don't waste your money unless you just can't stand to not have this in your library.....its a very CHEAP price and a disgrace!Lets all hope....HOPE .....that they bring this out with an improved image....Heck, colorized films from decades before look better than this sickening sea of GREEN! No shadow details..blotchy mess...I'll quit now....you get the point."
2,Two terrible transfer's in row,"The first DVD release of The Quiet Man was terrible then they released a Collectors Edition. I purchased it and could not believe that it had not been improved at all! The Color is very bad and the Audio is very second rate. This wonderful film needs to be restored, it's audio remastered and released again. We're getting taken to the cleaners folks!"
3,Cell phone quality copy,"The Quiet Man is a great story and I would love to have a decent copy. I have now purchased both the Collector's edition and the John Wayne Collection on DVD. There is NO difference between the two. They are both junk as far as the remastering quality. I find it interesting that Artisan released the first DVD in 1999 and then turned around and re-released the second in 2002, which should have been a ""Fix"" to the problem. They scammed the public twice with this one. ""Remastered"" is not an apt term. They look like they were copied with a cheap cell phone. I'm still hoping for someone to release a good quality copy, as long as it is not Artisan. I won't waste any more money or time on them. Amazon should discontinue these two items."
3,Classic Movie - Horrible DVD transfer,"Simply put, this is my favorite movie of all time, and I am sad to say I have to agree with others that the digital transfer to DVD of this film is horrible, let the buyer beware. I have the 40th Anniversary VHS and with all of the limitation of that medium, they started with a far better print of the film and it is actually still far more presentable than the current DVD. I am being vocal on this both to warn fans and potential fans of the film of the lackluster transfer, and to let the powers that be know that this is one beloved film and that I would happily purchase it again when a digitally enhanced high quality transfer struck from the original negative is available."
5,""" If just for the scenery you have to view this Movie treat","To say the least here is a movie you can watch over and over and never tire of all elements involved.I highly recommend it for all ages and tastes.This is True romance,out doing the Titanic by far for true Love."" The ending will not leave you with that sinking feeling""."
2,The Quiet Man (Collector's Edition),This film is one of my top 5 favorites. I have viewed it many times. A few of our friends are going to Ireland and had not seen The Quiet Man so I purchased the Collector's Edition for all of us to view together. I was so disappointed with the color that we could hardly view to the end of the film. The intensity of the color ruined the story line - we were so distracted by it. I would never recommend purchasing that edition to anyone
3,An Irish fable well told,"This review applies to the ""Collector's Edition DVD"": Four+ stars for the movie, which - while it has little to do with the Ireland of history, has much to do with the Ireland of fable. John Ford and his remarkable cast capture the spirit of that latter Ireland and spread it across the screen. Wayne and O'Hara are close to perfect, and the star-studded cast play their fabled Ireland beautifully. About the only quibble I have with the movie itself is that during the great donnybrook the film was speeded up to make the action faster, and it's pretty obvious.A star or so off for the DVD transfer, where the green and red saturation are a bit high, and a number of single-frame artifacts were left in. The first can be controlled with a bit of video adjustment, and the second isn't all that distracting - but why not do it right?I'd stand in line for a newly-mastered DVD."
4,Outstanding Wayne film about man who goes to Ireland to look up kin and gets more than he bargains for,Superb John Wayne role/movieand different type role forthe Duke this time around.Fourth career movie with Mau-reen O'Hara. Definately worthwatching!
5,Ireland,"This movie captures much of the spirit of Ireland. I haven't been there since the early 80s, but was on the west coast near the town of Cong where this movie was filmed. Again the chemistry of Wayne and O'Hara takes this film to a magical land and people - Ireland. Next best thing to being there!"
1,not his best,story is drawn out and not so bright. really your making me add more words before i can post my comment. amazon fail..ramble ramble ramble
3,"Good, but not one of his best!","""Orphans of the Sky"" by Robert Heinlein isn't one of his best efforts. It is certainly one of his most original and imaginative storylines but I found it difficult to like or befriend any of the protagonists. Ironically, I related more to the the ""Muties"" than I did the earthlings. The mutant Joe-Jim is a terrific characterization and anti-hero who made the story entertaining. The ending was somewhat anticlimactic and predictable but I generally enjoyed the story. 3 stars!"
3,Nice plot but leaves you wanting,"3.5 stars.This is a good book, not to be missed by SF fans. My only complaint was that the psychology of people who are not familiar with a concept of anything outside their own ship had enormous potential, but was explored in a fairly casual manner - not very convincing. But the rest of the story is tops."
5,Not Free SF Reader,"Generation Ship classic.A fixup if you like, with two parts set at different times and places, as the society of a crew of a large, multi-generational spaceship undergoes change, from general hierarchy, to small population mutation.From an original Mutiny and conflict, to the later institutionalisation of professions as religion and ship history as mythology, even forgetting what actually exists outside in space, and what they are trying to accomplish, and where they are going.Orphans of the Sky : Universe - Robert A. Heinlein - Robert A. HeinleinOrphans of the Sky : Common Sense - Robert A. Heinlein - Robert A. HeinleinOutside discovery ship mutiny conflict.3.5 out of 5Two-headed leadership.3.5 out of 54.5 out of 5"
4,Good read,"This was a nice short story (it IS short compared to some of Heinlein's other work) with a enjoyable premise and plot. The only real flaw of this book was that this story was published by itself, when it would have been better as part of a collection. I understand that it WAS part of a series, but for whatever reason, this new publication isolates this story. But like I said, that's it only real flaw, because I wanted to know what happened after the ending and had to read it somewhere else.Edit-I didn't find out until later that this story was actually part of a collection, happening within the same 'universe' as many of his other works, and that the fate of the Ship is revealed in another novel. I only wish the publisher had handled the publication of these books better, I was a fairly new Heinlein reader when I read this book."
1,simply dreadful,"This is piece of excrement that should interest at all no one over the age of twelve with a modicum of taste and intelligence. On the other hand, it's also a...book (I hate to dignify it with this word) children should be discouraged from reading. Heinlein is a B science-fiction writer (at best--""Stranger in a Stranger Land""), but ""Orphans of the Sky"" is a Z work. AVOID IT."
3,A science fiction classic,"This novel as far as I know is the first novelization of the ""generational spaceship"" concept. In the story mankind has not solved the problem of traveling faster-than-light, and accordingly is seeking to colonize nearby stars using spaceships that will take many generations to reach their goal. But something has gone terribly wrong, and a strange and unpleasant civilization, which has forgotten the entire purpose of the voyage, has evolved on the ship. This novel does not feature Heinlein's best writing, but it is a thoughtful and engrossing story. Recommended. RJB."
1,Alright i guess,You live and you learn. I bought this to remove the valve springs on my 92 civic 1.5L cylinder head. I removed all the exhaust springs by luck and could not remove any of my intake springs. I regret buying this product for that cause.
5,The Joy of LEXX,"You don't have to watch the movies or Series 2 to enjoy LEXX Series 3 (though it does help) to enjoy the naughty humor and actions of the LEXX crew. After being frozen in cryo-stasis for more than 4,000 years, the crew are awaken by Prince, the immortal ruler of Fire, one of the planets the LEXX is orbiting, the other planet being Water. Xev is manipulated and Stan is tortured, leaving Kai to rescue them (as usual), first having to repair a damaged 790, who then forgets Xev and falls in-love with the dead man.Put the kids to bed and keep the volume down as you watch this imaginative sci-fi series. You'll fall in-love with Kai, Xev and Stan the more you watch, and you'll want to see more once to see these first 4 episodes."
1,Highly unreliable,"These SD cards turn out to be highly unreliable. Constant memory errors. And while most vendors give lifetime warranty on their flash memory cards, of course AGL and the seller are nowhere to be found. Stay away!"
5,Excellent Beginning,"There are very few beginning Chinese language videos for kids so it's hard not to appreciate everything available. This one is very good - I really liked the Chinese pronounciation printed on the screen and little pamphlet that comes along with the video. Makes it easier for the viewer to sing along. The teacher does a good job reviewing numbers, colors, animals, etc. with good teaching aids. (something another earlier-produced Chinese video did not have.) The only small shortcoming is that it appears the video was produced with one camera without any special ""add-ins"" to raise the quality up a notch. I only say this to alert you if you are used to seeing other kids videos that have very slick graphics and cut-ins and outs. As I noted in the beginning of this review, there are very few Chinese videos fo kids so I very much appreciate something new for my child to watch."
4,Wonderful video with some minor technical flaws,"My 5 years son and I have enjoyed this video and learnt a lot, my son is getting the very chinese pronounciation of difficult words and really likes it. However the only problem is that a the end of the video there are some technical problems that make the image noisy and not clear.I am looking forward for a second one."
3,determinaton,"This book was pretty good. The reason it was good is because it was about a boy with a rare disease. It showed how he overcomes all the problems he had to face in having the disease. He still had a girlfriend too, so he had to keep that relationship going while he was practically living in the hospital. He gets pulled in to a type of nature-loving group that fights pollution that his girlfriend is involved with. And it starts showing the whole story uncover while he goes on adventures with his girlfriend as they try to stop pollution."
3,It is a good book to read.,I thought it was a good book.It needs more action. The only action parts is when Fred(main character)breaks a fence and when he beats up some kids.
5,"""Happy Ending?"" I wish they'd shot Brad Pitt....","What did I do right? I bought this ""special edition"" of Thelma & Louise @ Wally World for $4.99! Regardless...I too love the scene where they blow up that truck. And the ""alternate ending"" with the car going over the cliff in slow motion to a song by BB King raises the hair on the back of my arms. I could go on forever without Grey Frey, though"
4,Thelma and Louise,"It was a very good transaction, delivered on time, no problems at all and the movie is excellent :D"
4,A Classic>,"I would consider that after all this years, Thelma and Louise has become a classic, it's amazing how Ridley Scott being British captures the feeling of this two American women, the cast is good Brad Pitt's first roll I believe, and Michael Madsen is great, but the greatest performance is delivered by Geena Davies, which makes you think whatever happened to this great actress. Thelma and Louise is a road movie, with many surprises that arise along the road.I definitely recommend this movie!!!"
5,Free spirits,Themla and Louise is the sort of film best friends watch together and use roleplay to base themselves on the tow lead females. The women are presented as free spirits who run from the law and develop their friendship into a remarkable bond.
5,"It sticks with you for days, weeks, months, years...","Yes, I had a hard time jogging this flic from my mind. The message it gives off is so inspiring, so empowering... and because it's given by two female lead characters, it's been termed a feminist movie. Sure, there was sex, margaritas and wild turkeys straight up. There was armed robbery, the murder of a would be rapist, and the shooting up of a large semi driven by a horny truck driver. But hey, these girls never backed down. They never gave up. Submissive... they were anything but. No wonder if caused such a fiasco. Jerry Falwall would've rolled over in his grave if he wasn't alive when this movie came out. Ha ha. Thelma and Louise is a classic. Sarandon and Davis are out of this world. Pitt has a chest to die for. And the music is wonderful. I have a convertible, and I love it because it makes me feel like Louise. It's just a great movie."
5,Great Chick Flick!!,"A real oldie but goodie. Great to revisit this movie now and then. Bought 2 copies for a friend and myself after a trip thru the canyons of AZ and UT which is where some of this movie was filmed. No, we did not go off a cliff in a convertible."
3,Women's road movie,"Thelma (Geena Davis) and Louise (Susan Sarandon) are two good friends who become fugitives from the law, their lives, and the male-dominated world that oppresses them. The film succeeds as much as it does due to fine direction by Ridley Scott, a lively screenplay by Callie Khouri, and top-notch performances by Sarandon and Davis. Somehow, though, these elements didn't gel into a completely satisfying movie experience for me. There were too many missteps such as the troglodyte truck driver who seems unable to do anything more than grunt and spew obscenities. It can be seen as a statement of female empowerment, but it accomplishes this by placing its male characters on a spectrum with impotence at one extreme and brutishness on the other."
3,"So-So Story, Way Too Long","""Thelma and Louise"" is somewhat entertaining, but drags in too many places. It is a story about a waitress, Louise (Susan Sarandon), and a picked-on housewife, Thelma (Geena Davis). They want to have a fun week-end, a girl's time for fun and relaxation at a friend's cabin. They can stay there for the week-end for free and that is as wild as they usually get. Somehow they become outlaws and ride through the West, robbing convenience stores and raising all kinds of dust with male Chauvinist pigs. Thelma and Louise enjoy the excitement too much and decide not to give up the fun.The movie could have been an hour shorter and a lot more interesting. The movie has some great scenic locations as they travel through the West."
4,So much potential,"This movie, and particularly the ending, had the potential to be so much better than it was. The first time I saw Thelma and Louise it didn't strike me as feminist but simply humanist. Despite some corny dialogue, a weak script and a group of somewhat shallow supporting characters, the movie did manage to hit a few emotional chords. But the best thing about this movie was the cinematic side. Outstanding performances from the lead actresses, breathtaking scenery, superb direction from Ridley Scott and a brilliant musical score by Hans Zimmer make this a must see for anyone who appreciates good movie making."
4,If your a woman you have to see this,This is a must for every woman on the planet. Susan Sarandons performance is A+ as usual and geena Davis does an excellant job playing the ditzy Thelma. These girls put new meaning into the word friendship. Great movie to watch with your best girlfriend.
5,Thelma & louise,"Came out 21 years ago and is just as exciting as it was on opening day. This movie reminds me of ""North by Northwest"" on steroids. While Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint stayed completely coifed and dressed to the nines.Thelma and Louise is just the opposite. The scenes of the vista of the northwest are breathtaking, even more sothan the Hitchcock movie. If Sarandon & Davis did not win academy awards then they were robbed and I think they were for I don't remember them getting awards. Simply put it is the story of two girl friends going for a night out without male permission and Davis becoming intoxicated and a drunk dragging her out to back of a car and fixing to rape her. Sarandon shoots him and from then on, hang on to your hats, you are going for one hell of a ride never to be forgotten. This movie is a masterpiece of acting and photography."
5,Favorites,Thelma & Louise 20th Anniversary DVD (Extended Collector's Edition) I enjoy this DVD every time I watch it. I saw it when it first came out and it is still hysterical and mixed with some excellent points of life. When pushed into a corner one does come out fighting. :)
5,"Funny, Original, a CLASSIC","This is my one of my favorite movies. Every time it comes on USA, TNT, or any other channel, I turn it on and watch it. It is original, funny, exiting, and gives you a excited feeling I can't really out into words. Go rent it TODAY!!"
5,EXCELLENT FANTASTIC GREAT!!!!!!!,More than a slap bang action film. Provides insight of two womans feelings and how they cope with the fact that they killed a man. Beyond acdemy peformances delivered by Sarandon and Davis.
5,The Ultimate Buddy Movie.,"This is definately Ridley Scott's best film to date. Thema and Louise may be one of the most popular chick flicks, but you do not have to be a woman to like it. This film is the absolute perfect movie to watch with your best friend. The way that Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis take you into the lives of these two friends is amazing. On their jouney they encounter lots of characters including a perverted truck driver, and a young drifter played by Brad Pitt. The movie all in all is good, and I would definately give it two thumbs way way up."
1,I guess feminists think crime and murder is ok,"Ok look I know at this very minute that there are men out there doing bad things to women. But guess what that door swings both ways and do we really need a Movie like this one to enlarge the gender gap between men and women. I really hate the way this movie shows people abusing firearms, being a gun owner that just drives me nuts! When I saw Susan Sarandons character shoot that guy in the parking lot I just threw up my arms and said ""Now that was really stupid""! Sure the guy was a dirt bag and he should be in jail but you can`t use lethal force like that if someone offends you . When she did that she might as well have shot her self because her life was destroyed at that point anyway She should have walked away and got out of there after she got Gena Davis away from him. Well that is all I have to say I am sorry if I offended anyone."
2,Thelma & Louise,"A young and a middle-aged bimbo,Had lives that were drifting in limbo,They caused a big ruckus,And blew up a truckus,And left behind Darryl and Jimbo."
2,a poor film,"I give it two stars, cause the acting is pretty good.I just found it ridiculous that you were supposed to sit there and sympathize with two women who broke the law all over again, did not go and report a crime commited against THEM,and then moped around.I'm sorry, I know that it's a movie,and I may have enjoyed this film more, if it hadn't had these demands to be taken so seriously.Trying to take this film seriously will make you go crazy.Not to mention, I though the way southerners were portrayed was poor.And the movie doesn't have enough plot...."
3,Mediocre,"My girlfriend and I watched the film for the first time last night, and our response was ""what's all the fuss about?"" It never drew me in; it always just seemed like a bunch of Hollywood types playing caricatures of white trash, with many absurd plot twists along the way. Harvey Keitel's attempt at a southern accent was particularly embarrassing. The annoying soundtrack, which sounded like some Don Henley B side, was particularly annoying and obtrusive. Brad Pitt's performance was the best thing in this film. Overall a waste of talent."
1,Hated this movie!,"I'm no Gloria Steinem but as a woman I found this way to ""men hating"" and all that. To me, it made women look horrible and really stuck to the bad stereotype of women. Blah! Bad accents don't help either."
1,Read the Fine Print,"I received the DVD in a Rush Hour soundtrack DVD case. Along with the DVD was a CD call ""Pump Ya Fist, Hip Hop Insired by the Black Panthers."" After I complained, the Seller did offer to give me a $10 discount on my next purchase. I went to their website but it was difficult to find a DVD unless you already had one in mind. Their DVDs are listed alphabetically. It would have helped if they'd had them also listed by category. I never used the discount. Will probably never purchase from this seller again."
2,Wrong means to the end,"Much was made of this film when it came out, and complaints were made that it didn't feature any appealing male characters. I put it to you that it doesn't feature any appealing characters, period. Thelma and Louise achieve their just liberation, but the means they employ to do so are: murder, alcohol, debauchery, and suicide. Hardly inspiring for feminists or anyone else."
2,Good but definitely NOT great!,"I can't believe this got all the acclaim it did, especially from the feminists. I didn't see anything particularly groundbreaking here. Okay story and acting, but that's it. Let's face it, ladies, we can do better than this."
4,Not a Chick Flick,"This film is not so much a Chick Flick as much as it is an adventure film about waking up and finding yourself. Some see it as an anti-man movie, but I always thought it was more about women taking their life back and taking control of their own destiny. Most of all it's about women not being defined by men.Early on Louise is the strong charcter and Thelma seems to be the weak one, but by the end they have both grown into someone who had been hiding inside all along.Louise lets down her guard and comes to terms with her past and Thelma becomes the strong, independant women she never knew she was.Two ordinary Southern women become outlaw-hero's in a matter of days.It's a high-speed movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat the entire time you watch it.In the end they take back their life, no matter how many HATED the ending."
5,Nothing Less than Perfection!,"I loved this movie very much. It absolutely screams for you to ""let your hair down."" I agree: LET THOSE BOBBY PINS FLY! Gorgeous cinametography, perfect casting, and a bit of wry humor, too. Brava!"
3,NOT THE SPECIAL EDITION,If you are shopping for the Special Edition with the extra features this is not it. I bought this DVD expecting to see the Thelma & Louise: The Last Journey documentary and the Original theatrical featurette as mentioned in the product details section on amazon. It turns out that the version of this movie that amazon is selling is the regular edition without the bonus material. I have written to amazon three times to inform them of the error and I have called in twice. So far amazon has not updated the web page. If I could rate amazons service I would give them one star. Don't waste your time here if you are looking for the special edition.
3,Very much Minor Hitchcock,"Looking at this Cold War film from a distance of half a century, much of the content and the sentiments seem terribly outdated. As a piece of filmmaking, TOPAZ certainly has atmosphere, with good use of various locations - even though I suspect the Cuban scenes were filmed elsewhere. However the film itself I think is about half an hour too long: too much time is spent on needless plot exposition, and there are few thrilling moments. The two central performances are colorless; this might not necessarily be a fault in itself (some of Hitchcock's other stars gave equally nondescript performances), but attention focuses too much on them and not sufficiently on telling the story. Hitchcock in a minor key."
4,"ALFRED HITCHCOCK, OPUS 51","A movie I considered as minor 25 years ago then after having seen it again every 5 years or so, I feel now the Hitchcock touch in every frame of Topaz and certain scenes start to linger in my memory after each showing: John Vernon as a Cuban with big blue eyes and his blond bodyguard, Karin Dor's dress and death, three Russians in Copenhagen, the lunch at Pierre's with Stafford observing Noiret's behaviour, the alternate endings. Highly recommended."
4,Who's on first?,"As so many people are I'm a Hitchcock fan. For some reason I've never seen this movie before. What a treat to happen upon an old friend in new clothes! This movie is based on Leon Uris' Cold War/Bay of Pigs novel of the same name. Agents and double agents, people changing allegiances, no way to tell who's telling the truth or even why they're saying and doing things. The photography (as is almost always true with Hitchcock) is startling. He does an omniscient thing by photographing from above so often interspersed with his signature WAY too close up shots. I was most struck by the actor who played Deveraux. I haven't read Uris' book so I'm not sure what his intent was but there doesn't seem to be any one character who you feel completely sympathetic with so it was hard to feel fully `present'. Not one of Hitchcock's best movie but hey, it's still Hitchcock."
4,The better Topaz with 17minutes footage,"This new video-version must be seen: Here Universal presents the original uncut version with a seventeen minutes footage and a new (and better) ending. It's includes more scenes with young Claude Jade as Stafford's worried daughter Michèle, for instance her joke when she arrives in New York and says ""Oh I love the cubans, they are so wild."" Or a laughing Karin Dor in Cuba; Frederick Stafford and Claude Jade in a car (with a Hitchcock-specific Blue Screen) or Stafford and Claude Jade visits the party at Michel Piccoli."
2,Topaz - does not shine like a usual Hitchcock film,"Read no further, if you are concerned about ""spoilers""....The IMDb explains that this film concerns ""Cold War politics,"" including parts ""leading up to the 1962 Cuban Missle Crisis."" Being a Hitchcock fan, I'd been eager to see this film, after learning of at least one scene filmed in NYC. Unfortunately, this film does NOT measure up to Hitchcock quality. A review on the web site of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops describes it well:* ""The dialogue is mostly banal and the action largely unconvincing, but there are occasional glimmers of the Hitchcock touch in subtle plot twists here and blind alleys there....Some physical and psychological violence and a lot of confusing intrigue."""
3,hitchock enters the cold war,Topaz isn't the best hicock movie out there but it is interesting to see him making a mystery about the cold war. They movie involves an american spy investigating Soviet dealing with Cuba. The movie isn't his best but still is a decent movie.
1,does not even deserve the one star!,"That's a really unrealistic movie, a complete political fantasy. This guy didnt have any idea about Cuba and his political situation. He doesnt understand neither the cultural background. He confuses Cuba with Mexico, because he portrays the wife of the guerrilla leader as an adelita. But, that is just ridiculous, because adelitas are part of Mexican revolution not cuban. Also, the story is absurd and silly. That is why my inteligence is offended."
3,Second-Rate Hitchcock Has Its Moments,"Director Alfred Hitchcock's uneven adaptation of Leon Uris' ""Topaz"" does not rank among his finest efforts. However, the 1969 espionage thriller is not without merit. There are classic Hitchcockian touches scattered amidst a rather overlong story, particularly his imaginative use of sound during the New York segments. Though lacking in star power, the international cast (particularly John Forsythe, Frederick Stafford, Roscoe Lee Browne, John Vernon and Karin Dor) is better than expected. Unfortunately, the film suffers from several lengthy dialogue sequences that bog down the globe-trotting narrative. ""Topaz"" cries out for more action - and less talk - from the Master of Suspense."
3,This is an OK movie,"This movie is OK, but it isn't very good. It's boring and hard to understand at times, but it does have suspense and romance. It also has an eerie mood and an OK plot, but I do recommend this movie to everyone who is a Hitchcock fan. I give this movie three stars."
2,Hitchcock Stumbles Again...Though This Is Probably More To Do With The Script.,"Note: I saw this movie with XFinity On Demand.Made after Torn Curtain, Topaz is Hitchcock's return to the spy genre. However, the film fails to generate any real suspense, unlike his earlier films, which are masterpieces and the mostly abysmal Torn Curtain (which had at least one good sequence that had plenty of suspense in comparison to the rest of the movie). I liked John Forsythe (who would later play the unseen Charlie in Charlie's Angels), and Frederick Stafford was very good as Devereaux. The film was also much too long than it should have been, in my opinion. Could have had a better plot and a much better screenplay, though. In my opinion, Torn Curtain was the beginning of the end for The Master Of Suspense as far as suspenseful motion pictures were concerned...In my opinion, Marnie was Hitchcock's last great movie.Rated PG (mild language & violence and a brief love scene)."
2,JCParis,"This remastering in 1.85 (a bit too larger for a 35 mm base film in ""flat widescreen"" format - 1.66 is most appropriate) is not to recommend for the ugly colors: flashy red, some colors faded, finaly bad color balance. Why to ""cook"" the originals colors?"
3,Not What I Thought,"Diappointed in music arrangements. Mainly bought the CD for the song ""Amazing Grace"" to use as background music for a vocal singer who was singing at a funeral; but the music was impossible to even figure out where to start & stop each verse."
1,a bad buy,well they wont let me give 0 stars so i guess i am stuck with one which also represents the amount of weeks it took before it stopped working. i should try to get my money back because i bought this cause my other adapter broke after a year so i figured time for a new one and now i guess i am stuck looking for another one. what more can i say than do NOT buy this. Not a scratch on it but it stopped working so thanks for nothing SONY. just a bad buy
1,You get what you pay for,The cassette played quietly while plugged into my iPod for one song and then it made a clicking noise. Despite increasing the volume on the stereo I could still hear the cassette. I owned a cassette adapter that I purchased years ago that finally kicked the bucket and in its old age it never made as much noise as this one does. I would definitely not recommend purchasing this product.Sony CPA-9C MiniDisc and Discman Cassette Adapter
4,works great with my Zune,I bought this cassette adapter since where I live there are so many radio stations an FM transmitter has trouble finding a clean station. I guess I'm lucky my car is old enough to still have a up-until-now Bose cassette deck. I also bought a cigarette adapter to power the cassette adapter. I now have a very inexpensive way to play my Zune in my car.
1,Horrible in my 2006 Toyota Highlander,"This fails to work in my 2006 Toyota Highlander cassette player, only yielding a very loud moderately high pitched buzzing sound. This can only be reduced by turning the volume control on the car deck to zero. The ipod sound can only be heard as a whisper under the hum when the ipod volume is at near maximum. Worthless."
4,Good value,"This thing works very well with my iPod Touch. It's a great buy for the price if, like me, you have a vehicle with no auxiliary port in the sound system. Sure, it's a little clunky and old-fashioned, but it does the job well."
4,Nice and reliable,"I recently changed cars and my new car didn't have the aux input, so I had to buy this adapter for my Ipod (Ipod Classic) it works great, the noise is minimum and the sound is awesome, I prefer it 100 times over the FM transmitter, the side A side B feature in every cassette player will help when the sound is extremely low, you just have to press to change the playback from one side to the other until you get the full sound."
5,"IPOD, ADAPTER, AND MY CAR","WORKS WELL WITH IPOD AND CAR [1999 MITSUBISHI GALANT]. SOUND IS GREAT, ETC. - NO ISSUES - /WHO NEEDS AN STATIONARY HARD DRIVE IN THE CAR. GET A POD AND THIS ADAPTER.ABOUT TO GET A NEW WHIP [LEXUS], SO IT WILL WORK WITH IT AS LONG AS IT HAS A CASSETTE PLAYER."
1,Awful,"I think I had a bad unit. Almost no volume when music was playing. Very loud hum when played in the car. And the unit itself made very loud clicky noises. My previous one was a Koss brand and it worked fine for years until the cable wiring got to be touchy and now only works if you hold the wire a certain way. Anyways, I returned it and got it credited back and now I'm looking for a new one. Oh and this was with an iPod."
1,Squeaky and only worked half the time,"I used this in my 2001 volkswagen passat. Right from the start, it was a crapshoot if it would actually play or not. Once I put it in, it would take a lot of random fast forwarding or rewinding in order for it to play. When it did play it was loud and squeaky.I always figured that this was due to my car, not any issue with the adapter.Well, about a year later (last week), it finally stopped working. I went to best buy and bought a Belkin adapter, and it works every time, without the squeaking noise.I'll take that to mean that my car is OK, and this thing is no good."
3,DID NOT WORK IN MY CAR,"TRIED A FEW TIMES, BUT THE PRODUCT DID NOT WORK. ENDED UP GIVING IT TO MY SON - IT DID WORK IN HIS CAR. VERY DISAPPOINTED."
4,Great buy!,"This was my second try at using a cassette adaptor for my ipod. I first bought the Monster brand and it worked fine for a few times and then the static kicked in. I gave this one a try and there was a little bit of static when I first put it in but when I lowered the volume on my ipod about 1/2 way and rewound the tape a bit, the sound was really clear, almost CD quality. The monster one was definitely not as quiet and clear. I haven't had any complaints since. Great deal for the price!"
1,It Broke After Two Days,"Do I really need to say anything else? While it worked, it was great, but after 48 hours of occasional use, the sound quality was suddenly so bad that I had to turn my volume ALL the way up to hear my music at all (and even then, the white noise was louder than the music). Don't waste your $15."
3,"Not great quality, better than normal tape","It's neat and all, but go with an cd player deck for the car-it's a lot better and worth the money. quality is between cd and cassette.I recently purchased the fm adapter for a lower price and was satisfied with good radio quality. If you want to do it an easy way and cannot afford the decks, i reccommend the adapter."
3,"Works, but not for long",This gadget works as advertised and gives good sound thru my car stereo. The problem is that my little MP3-player can not drive it for more than 30 minutes before the battery dies. If a put a new battery in my player it is good for another 30 minutes again. I suspect that the cassette is loading the output from the player too much.
1,Big Disappointment,"Well I thought I would try using this for my ipod mini, seeing as other wireless FM products were receiving negative reviews. Much to my dismay, this product did a terrible job. The sound was airy, soft, and could hardly be heard, even when using a portable CD player.Overall, this product was a thumbs down."
1,warning: does not work for iphone or ipods,BEWARE of the ads toting this product as an iphone or ipod adapter for your car. the jack size does not fit the port.
4,It works fine,"At first, when I wanted to enjoy my Ipod in the car I got the Itrip, but had a lot of trouble getting a good and strong free frequency on the radio (all of them where busy) at least while I was in the city. Then I got the Sony CPA-9C CD/MD Cassette Adaptor and I've got much better results. Now I can listen to my favorite music but the sound is not completely perfect. I consider it looses about 10-15% of its quality. Until now, it's the best I've got for using the Ipod in the car."
4,Not bad,"Overall, this is a pretty nifty product. The sound quality in my SUV is quite good. I wish the volume/intensity of the sound was a bit better, but that might have to do with the small output power of the iPod??? Also, I hear a bit of a buzzing sound during some playback -- much worse in my wife's car actually. All that said, though, this is a great and inexpensive way to listen to my iPod in the car."
4,Does a good job,"Having just tossed an FM transmitter set up for using my ipod in my car, this cassette kit works better than expected Sound is a lot better than with the FM transmitter. Not quite as good as a CD, but for the money and ease of use a worthwhile item. Only thing I had to do when I put the cassette into my player was reverse the tape play direction and I could hear the m, this usic. For the moneyis a good deal."
3,less than satisfied,"Prior to this product, I used a philips cassette adapter that worked flawlessly until the wires got stripped due to bad care.I bought this product hoping it would provide me with similar quality at the least. Turns out I was wrong.It constantly produces this static, and turning the volume up to the max on my mp3 produced even more static, which was never an issue for my philips one.It's quite cheaply made, so if you're looking for quality product, don't buy this one."
2,Durability issue,"I had poor luck with mine. The wire lacks a strain relief where it enters the case and within two months I was getting lots of intermittent drop-outs. I'm now trying the Philips PH-62050, which cost a little less and fits both front and side loading cassette players. Sound quality is very decent with both brands."
4,Clear sounds,I hooked this up with the belkin charger for my car and it comes in much clearer than using a FM transmitter.
3,okay i guess...,"When playing certain songs that have a high pitch, the sound gets distorted and is a unpleasant interruption of what would be a fantastic song."
1,Good if you only need the left channel.,"I have a very old version, but same model number, of this adapter for years. It got used daily for years and I only had the connector fail from lots of use. I replaced it at least 6 times, but the cassette worked great.I got tired of replacing the headphone connector and figured I would order a new one, and an extra.The new adapters came in a package with a copyright of 1998. It the exact same model and vintage as mine.Only on this new, only the left channel works. I tried it on different players, different tape decks, and only the left channel works. On both adapters I ordered, only the left channel works.So I am still the hunt for a cassette adapter that works."
3,Great product,It's a decent product in that the audio is great in quality but in my 2003 Toyota Camry it makes a loud clicking sound every second which is hard to drown out with the music or whatever.
4,One thing annoying,"The sound quality that this product offers is quite good.I own a 99 camry and I'm not sure whether the product isn'tcompatible with my car stereo, but it makes a regular intervalclicks like a grandfather clock with a pendulum. If you'relistening to loud music it's alright, but it gets quite annoyingwhen you're listening to quite music. Does anyone have similarproblems?"
1,This Cannot Be a Sony,"I've been using cassette adaptors for years, and this is by far the worse one. Shame on Sony. The adaptor is almost identical to others in all aspects but out-of-the-box sound. Low-end is almost non-existent, while the high-end is overbearing. Try a Panasonic cassette adaptor instead for better bass and overall quality."
4,Quality per dollar is Great!!!,"Got one from Fry's electronic in different package but it was Sony CPA-9C. Many customers complained about no sound or humming sound or they have to volumn up their radios. This is a solution. First of all, it's not this stuff's fault. I read the instruction then tried to switch the direction of the tape player (by pressing |<< >>| at the same time). It does work and work really fine."
4,How to fix the 'spit out' problem,"I too had the problem of the car cassette player spitting the tape out. What you have to do is break off, file off or otherwise remove the little cogs on the inside of the two holes in the adapter. This way the spindle in the cassette player will feel no tension, so will carry on 'playing' happily. I was quite proud of myself when I worked this out! ;-)"
4,Good,"I plug in my MP3 player with this, except for some little hissing noise at times, its a good buy.Perfect one to hook up the MP3 player to the car."
5,A great product,"This works great thus far and after much research chose this model.After using other brands that failed rather quickly, I spent the extra money and am satisfied. Not noisy as other brands have been. Great Amazon price as well. Enjoy."
5,PERFECT,"Very simple device. Unlike the Philips adapter also purchased from Amazon, this one did not cause my player to keep reversing until it decides the tape is unplayable and ejects it. Sound quality is excellent.PROS: Sound Quality. Sturdy case. Thicker wire than present on the Philips adapter.CONS: Wire only exits from one side and can't be moved."
3,Sometimes issues,"This thing is okay. Sometimes it does not work in our car and at times the tape player makes some noise and the playback volume is reduced. We try to avoid that by ejecting the piece more frequently. Sometimes it gets stuck and won't eject.Hard to say what the reason is, but I was not too pleased."
4,"Sounds great, but doesn't last","Eventually, the tape will start to autoreverse in the player and then start ejecting itself, but until it does, it sounds better than anything else I've tried. I'm on my second one and the sound quality is far better than the Phillips I bought to use until this one arrived or either of the FM transmitters I've tried. It's cheap enough and sounds good enough that I'm willing to replace it if it breaks again."
5,Completely Satisfied,"I purchase the XM adapter months ago, because I was looking for something cheap and quick. I quickly got tired of it--it did its job, but had this weird screechy sound, so I began looking for something else. I stumbled upon this Sony Cassette Adapter because of the high rating.I have to say: the cord quality is good, the quality of the audio is much better than the XM--you can turn up the music on an iPod all the way and it won't distort the audio. My car is over 15 years old and I don't have that auto reverse problem people complain about, in fact, I've had no problem.I would not hesitate in recommending this product--if you need it, this is the one to buy! I've owned the XM one and a Belkin one prior to this one. The Belkin one was absolutely terrible and broke after a few months--I even thought it would mess up my tape deck because of the loud noises it made."
3,"Works for awhile, then starts making noise.","We bought this for a 16-hour round trip vacation and it worked flawlessly for the probably 10 hours we used it in total. We were impressed. That said, upon returning home and trying to use it on trips around town, it has now started making rattling noises...as they all eventually seem to at one time or another. I don't want to turn up the music loud enough to overcome the rattling, so it has gone in the trash."
5,GREAT!,"what a great product i just turned 18,i get my liences in 1 more month,i waited to save up for more money for a new car,but anyways imma be drivin a old 1989 Chevy Trucks an my dad has just an cassette player so i bought this,give it a try,i have an IPOD,plug it in,works beautiful an perfectCAME IN WITHINN 2DAYS GREAT SERVICES DO BUSINESS AGAIN,love product always thxs alotps:30day returnable,it says,no reason to great product"
3,Cant Complain,This product works great all things considered. There is a tiny little buzzing noise and i cant figure out exactly why. It is a replacement for my broken cd player in my car. I like it because I can put it away so no one would want to break into my car!
3,not horrible for the price,"I was happy with the cassette adapter initially. I use it for my ipod and the sound quality is much better than the fm transmitter i was using. But after just a few uses, when inserting the cassette, the stereo gives an error saying ""check tape"" and i have to eject and reinsert the cassette several times before it works properly."
1,Horrible tape deck noise!,"This Sony Cassette adapter gets GREAT reviews on Amazon, so naturally I thought it would be the cure for all my car iPod car listening problems. Boy was I wrong. This the single most nosiest cassette adapter I have ever used in my life. Usually you'll hear a few clicks inside the tape deck from other adapters, but in Sony's case--the clicking noise was constant and made using it completely impossible to use. This gets a HUGE NAY from me. I find Belkin's adapter to be FAR superior. I would never recommend this adapter to anyone."
2,It was great while it lasted,"The Sony adapter sounded good, but it worked for less than 90 days before it quit. Others have commented on its short life span. I figured I wouldn't be out a lot of money if it died, so I was willing to give it a try, but I wish it had held up longer. I guess you get what you pay for."
3,ok for the money,"You can hear the wheels turning when sound is low, with occasional crackling as with cassette tapes, but overall it not that bad"
1,"Horrible product. Almost inaudible music, noisy operation","This product does not work with iPod Mini's. I tried it with two mini's in two cars, and the volume is very very low, so that if I play it and then switch to another source I can blow out my speakers, and the player itself is noisy.Avoid. Avoid. Avoid."
4,I like it,"What sold me on this adapter is the head is spring loaded to stay in contact with the Cassette Player heads. The sound quality has been great.Unfortunately, the gears made a bit of noise from day one, and after a couple of weeks, the squeaking was audible over road noise. I borrowed some of my Father-in-Law's heavy duty silicone spray to try to lube the gears.Don't make the same mistake I made. There seems to be a solvent in his can of lube; the label on the adapter got smeared, etc, and the gears almost got glued together. I worked at it a little bit and freed everything up. Now, I can just barely hear the gear noise when I'm stopped and the engine is off.Next time, I'll get a spray can of pure silicone so I won't have the problem with dissolving plastic.I would have given this 5 stars except the noise started soon after I started using it.Additionally, I'm using it with no problems in a 2006 Toyota Highlander Hybrid."
4,Best bet for cassette adapters,"Until FM transmitters get better, this is the way to go and the Sony CPA-9C has worked flawlessly with decent sound quality."
1,Hated it! Twice!,"I read reviews saying how great this converter was, spring loaded, noiseless, great range, etc. That's all fine and doodle dandy but they have to last more than a couple weeks! One kept flipping sides. The other one just cut out where if you turned everything up all the way you could barely hear it. I got a Belkin. Maybe that will last more than a month."
1,Works horrible,I bought it in February already doesn't work. I should have gone with the cheaper version and at least I wouldn't have been out as much money.
1,don't waste your money,this product is so quite that you can barely hear your music over the road noise. don't bother teasing yourself.
4,"I like it, but don't love it","I got this adapter to work with my Ipod Classic, and when I first tried it in my car, I didn't think it worked. I was just about to go to the store and buy a different one, when I found out that you have to make sure that the tape is playing on side A, side B only makes a hissing noise. After I figured out how to use my tape player in the car, (after all, how many people still use a tape deck), it's been pretty good since. I don't really like that the volume is a little touchy with this adapter. Just a very small turn of the knob, and it gets a lot louder. I will have to say though, I bought my wife aMonster iCarPlay Wireless Plus FM Transmitter/Charger for iPod, and I like the cassette adapter more, because I don't have to worry about fumbling with the stations when they start to have a lot of static while on long trips."
1,Garbage -,"I have had tape deck adapters before and this one is by far the worst purchase ever made. The wire was semi loose from day one and within a week started giving trouble. I had to shake the wire, wrap it around my shifter and hold it at certain angles to get decent sound or even any sound at all. Then the plug wire started giving trouble and I decided it was not worth the effort - and dumped it."
5,Solid unit does the job,"After a few weeks of use I am very satisfied with this unit. As the description says, it will only fit into a cassette deck if the deck accepts tapes end-on. Sound is consistently good from my portable CD player, the cord is nice and long but not bulky, and the unit seems durable. I don't know what could be improved."
2,Doesn't work on my Toyota Sienna,"In my Sienna it plays for about 3 seconds, reverses sides, then ejects. I opened it up and tried some changes I found online, but no luck. I guess that will teach me to not throw away the packaging before I've tested a product."
5,Perfect,"Like the other reviewers, I've tried a few of the ""FM transmitters"" but the quality is so poor it's hardly worth it. This device is just what I needed short of getting a new stereo with an auxillary input. The price is right, the sound is CD quality and I have no complaints. I'm using this with a Zen Vision 30GB and it works perfectly. I'd buy another."
4,Works pretty good but...,"This isn't a bad purchase, I just find with things like this that they don't work consistently. I use it for my MP3 player in my car and it worked for the first 2 weeks amazingly. Then it started with the random ""error"" messages. I made sure to never leave it in my car, especially in the cold and took great care of it when I stored it. I still think it is worth it for the price, you just might go through a few of them. I did have an old one of this same kind and it did last almost a year so I still recommend it. I just wish there were easier ways to listen to my MP3s until I get a car that has it standard."
3,"Relatively inexpensive, but mine squeaks.....","Perhaps I got the random statistical quality control failure, but mine often squeaks and it's annoying. I was drawn to the Sony name brand, with a reputation for quality, but I'm disappointed with the performance of my particular unit. I suspect that if I played the music loud enough it might drown out the squeak, but that's not the norm for me, and it's particularly disappointing when listening to soft music. That said, it does function, and it's hard to argue with the price, so with that in mind I give it a ""fair"" rating."
5,So far so great,"I bought this cassette adapter for my very old Opel Vectra which didn't have a cd player. For those of you who have never heard about the car - its a german car sold in Europe. Anyways, the thing works great with my Zune. I have a first gen. Zune and an old car but this adapter makes me feel contemporary. :) The sound quality is quite high and the sound is clear. It was -10 C the past week and it didn't even freeze. They should advertize that. I have heard however that these things stop working after a couple months, I am totally fine with paying this price for this product every few months tho. Be smart and don't get too cheap and buy this product - the other ones are only a couple bucks cheaper but much worse. :D"
2,little life time,"It worked well when it worked. After a week, the tape switched to side 2 strangely and never worked. the adapter was not recognized again. i went with a philips one which seems to work good."
4,great alternative to replacing car stereo,"This is way better product for adapting your mp3 player to your car stereo than the fm tuners. I bought this to replace the $40.00 fm tuner I bought which did not work well at all. I drove all the way from south Jersey to upstate New York with the fm tuner and no matter what unused station we used, it constantly had fuzz. So it was back to the drawing board. I read reviews and picked out the Sony based on it. It has been great. No fuzz, no ejecting over bumps. Just clear music from mp3 player at a fraction of the cost of replacing my stereo system."
2,Great . . . While It Lasted,"I am a Sony devotee, I love Sony and it is my brand, and I was enjoying the product for what it did. I was able to listen to my ipod in my car and it was great, but recently I started to hear clicking. A regular ticking with a pretty consistant period, and it drives me crazy. I tested my ipod with headphones and it played perfectly, my radio played perfectly so it wasn't my speakers. I just find it frustrating that it only lasted for 5 months or so."
3,Affordable solution for listenting to audio books,"I use this for listening to audio books off my MP3 player, and it's a good solution for this application. My only complaint is that the tape unit clicks while it is turning, which can get a bit annoying at low volumes. But for less than $15, I don't know that you can expect crystal clear audio. Overall, it solves my problem listening problem.Oh, and I ran into the low volume problem when using it in a friend's car -- I only had to change the direction of the tape deck and suddenly I had LOUD volume."
5,Works Pretty Good For All I Know,"I haven't tried other cassette adaptors. All I know is this works pretty good with a Sony CD player and I am satisified with the sound and the usual Sony quality.Just plug in the jack, stick it in the cassette player, and your off!Remember, this only works with sideway cassette players in your car. Don't forget to read the instructions which tell you to turn off the Dolby NR, set it to TYPE 1 and turn off other features if your cassette adaptor has it, such as ""skip"" feature, etc.SOUND? It sounded much better than the built-in radio FM in my truck. A lot more clarity and bass within the limitations of the speaker and electronics which are OEM. A big improvement for a small price."
1,Worked for a week...,"This thing sounded great, little hiss and low mechanism noise. After a week or two it would no longer ""activate"", constantly spitting out of the player. I became so frustrated with it I smashed it."
5,works as described!,"everything about this tape was as described. The only disappointing thing is that when using this product you can hear a small ""buzz"" sound behind the music. I would of also appreciated if Sony made this tape out of some higher quality material then the cheap plastic that is used. Other than that this product works well."
5,It's working great so far.,"I just bought this and started using it... for the record I have a 2003 Toyota Rav4. I've had none of the auto reverse issues, there is some noise when the ipod isn't playing but the tape is running, but it's easily drowned out by the road noise from the car (I suppose if the car were built better, the tape noise would annoy me more, but as it stands I'm solely annoyed by the car.)Overall it's working great. as to the durability issues, I'll check back in a few months, that said... given the age of my vehichle and the relative costs, I could replace this 12 times before it matches the cost of the hard wired option.I'm confident that the car will die before I get to 12 of these units.Update 6/22/12: The Car is dead but this thing is still working fine. I don't need it any longer as the car I replaced the RAV with is already blue tooth enabled. Anyone want to buy it for $5 :)"
1,Horrible,Horrible product. Had to return it. The sound quality is not very good. Has a lot of noise. The volume level is low.There is a constant hissing sound. I use the adapter that was ordered from meritline for 2 bucks does a great job.
3,Didn't last,It worked for almost a year. Then it worked intermittently until not working at all. Too bad for me.
3,Does the job,"This thing works just fine for what it does: provide a way to hook an mp3 player into a car cassette deck. The sound quality absolutely beats an FM transmitter. That said, the device itself makes a certain amount of noise--not much, and I've had similar devices that were louder--but you can definitely hear it if the audio you're playing is quiet and your car's noise doesn't overpower it."
4,works fine,This works exactly as advertised. The only problem I had with it was the packaging - stripping the plastic foil from the casette head was not easy process but I had managed to get it done with my pocket knife :) (but then I had to wipe it with alcohol)
4,Work Great for its price,I bought this from amazon for $15 and it works great with my car audio.It is easy to use and working fine till now. The audio quality is decent and surely recommend this.
3,Not Compatible with all cars,I bet the quality is really great except it doesnt work in my car tape's player. I have a Volkswagen Jetta and it is not compatible with this tape. Other tapes have worked but If it works its great for the price.
3,Mechanical issues,Purchased this item as it is from Sony. In less than a month the adapter started to make a loud whirring mechanical noise in my car's cassette deck. Other cassettes don't do the same. Getting a replacement in the hopes that I had a defective item.
2,Sony Cassette Adapter,"Decent sound quality, but after a couple of weeks stopped working properly. Keeps spitting out of my tape deck & you have to try putting it back in many times before it works again. BIG PAIN! Haven't had this problem with other brands I've had over the years."
1,Garbage,"I give it a 0 out of 10. It had horrible sound quality and kept ejecting. I ended up snapping this product in half, from how much of a hassle it was. If you want to listen to your mp3 player in the car, I suggest spending a few more bucks for a better product."
1,Didn't Work with my 2003 VW Jetta,"I bought this to play the music in my Mp3 player inside my car. When I first put it in, I was taken back by the horrible sound quality. The volume was extremely low, the adapter itself made a loud mechanical sound, and there was a lot of background noise. After about 30 seconds or so, my Monsoon sound system showed an error on the screen and spit the adapter out. Maybe I just had a bad one, but if this is how all of them are, you're better off with an FM transmitter."
3,"This product has good, but not great, sound.","This little cassette converter has fair sound, but it isn't great. It seems to chop off the high treble and lowest bass. It has quiet operation and is easy to use."
3,Tape sound is awful,I had this tape before and it worked awesome but the wires frayed at the plug. When i got this one sound its awful this time. I use it on a sony boombox that has awesome speakers and connect to ipods. So hard to tell which of the tape adapters are good. My panasonic one was the best but the cord frayed too.
1,Uneven sound from speakers,"I have been using tape deck adapters for years in my car to listen to music off of my phone. This is the first one to have problems. First, there is barely any sound coming out of the speakers on the right side of my car, so I need to change the balance setting every time I use it. Second, whenever I use it for more than about 10 minutes it begins making loud mechanical noises, like something is rubbing inside of the deck. I've finally had enough of it, throwing it out and trying a different brand."
3,Sound Quality needs to be improved,For the price... i would look for better sound than this can produce.Lots of echo and noise when someone speaks ..to connect and receive ph in car its a mess.you actually have to have your system set on tape for it to work.. don't really wanna go thru all that headache when driving..if you can't hear and pull up the volume of your tape then there is so much echo that the other end will almost go crazy talking and figuring out your voice.NO NO for me at least.
1,Does not work with 2001 Toyota Camry,"I have tried multiple cassette adapters in the tape deck in my 2001 Toyota Camry. All have the same problem: a loud, mechanical *click* *click* *click* noise while the tape plays. The audio translated from the mp3 player comes out fine, but the loud clicking from the tape deck defeats the point. I thought this adapter might produce different results, but apparently not."
1,Sony CPA-9C MiniDisc and Discman Cassette Adapter,"You'd expect better from a Sony product but I must say, this item is a piece of junk. The sound quality is very poor. I previously had a cassette adapter that I gave to a friend of mine. This adapter I bought at a dollar store for a dollar and it worked flawlessly. I expected this one to work at least just as well as the no frills adapter but to no avail... Sony has failed me."
2,Started out nice...,...then after one afternoon in the hot car the sound was warped and hasn't gone back to normal... will be trying a different brand this time.
3,not worth the extra money,"I bought two cassette adapters, one from sony(this one) and one which costs less from coby.the coby is more versatile as it fits into two types of player. the coby also has a coiled lead.otherwise to my ear and eye for quality they are very similar."
1,PIECE OF JUNK!,Whatever you do- don't buy this item! It just doesn't work! I have tried this item in 3 different car stereos. One stereo ejected the tape over and over again. The other 2 stereos played an extremely low sound (which sort of resembled music) and there was an awful lot of background noise- more noise than music! I tried to use this device with my iPod. It might work with other devices (possibly a Sony CD player) but I have not tried. If you are looking to play your iPod through your car stereo- look elsewhere!
2,CLicking noise,The tape makes a clicking noise while playing. The only way to stop it was to raise the volume of the music to cover the loud clicks.
1,"Cheap Product, Don't Bother","I bought this for my parents to connect an MP3 player in their car. The first time they used it, it didn't work properly. It would only send the sound through half the speakers in their car. The one that I had for myself (a Panasonic) worked fine in their car and this one seemed to work in mine, so we swapped. I've used this SONY one about 5 times and it's already broken. Don't waste your time!"
2,"Cheap, but you get what you pay for.","It could just be the cars that I'm using it in, but I've tried it in 3 so far and it only worked decently in one of them. With the volume raised completely on the iPod and the stereo, I could still barely get a decent sound. If that wasn't the problem, the cassette itself would make an unbearable noise. The bass and treble aren't very good either. It's a risk to buy this. It's cheap enough if you want to try it out."
3,It makes a little buzz,This adapter makes a little sound while it is working... i don't like it too much...
3,Makes 'clicking' noises in the tape deck...,"I just received it yesterday and was excited to try after reading so many good reviews. However I'm still on the fence about it because when the cassette adapter is inserted to the tape deck in the car, it keeps making some sort of 'clicking' noises. I use it with my new video iPod and the audio output is good, however I can't get over the clicking sounds the adapter makes. I tried forwarding & rewinding the tape to see if that would make a difference, but to no avail. (By the way I tried the cassette adapter in a Lexus GS.)Maybe it's a defective product that I got? Anyone has any ideas?P.S. I have used a Belkin cassette adapter in the same car with the same iPod but didn't have this issue with clicking noises coming from the tape deck."
3,works but sound quality is not great.,"The sound quality seems to be about same as tape sound quality.When I raise the volume just little bit, sound gets distorted. The quality is definitely less than CD quality. Do not expect super quality."
3,Didn't play nice with my tape deck,"Periodically makes a horrible grinding noise. It's a mechanical noise coming from the tape deck, not a sound quality issue. Sound quality is a bit muddy and flat, but I suspect it is probably par for the course with a tape adapter. All my mp3s are encoded at various quality levels, so volume fluctuation from song to song is a bit of a problem - more so than when I have used aux in adapters in the past.I actually fixed the grinding noise by tearing the thing open and removing the tape part. No idea why that worked, but it gets the job done now and I don't have to go look for another one."
2,"Good Sound, but no more...","I got mine 2months ago.It runs poorly with ""tick...tick...tick"" sound in the beginning. Then, after a month, no more tick sound.After two months, the wire begin to have problem.... it can play the music from MP3, but the sound becomes weird... (like without base.. ..). If you shake the wire.. then it becomes normal..Last week, no more normal.... .. BROKEN...Cons: I like it alot when the cassette runs normal... especially the quality of the sound(I am not using Ipod)My Car: Lexus 2gen ES300***Maybe is the product problem.. I would like to get one(it have to be a normal, no more broken cassette adapter..)"
4,Great Quality,Very Good Sound Quality and built quality. Indeed a necessity to listen to music from a MP3 player to your car or at home.
2,Sony CPA-9C MiniDisc and Discman Cassette Adapter,Skip it. Sound quality is only fair. I bought it to use between my Palm Pilot mp3 player and my car stereo. Later I purchased an FM wireless transmitter that plays through the radio. Cheaper and much better sound.
5,Excellent product!,I had one of these back in college (15 or so years ago) for my cd player & I just bought another for my ipod because I couldn't find the box that the original one is burried in. It does what it should & does it MUCH better than the FM transmitter I originally tried (RoadTrip). Music sound is equivalent to my radio-- I'm so fortunate to have that cassette player in my car that I've never used until now!
5,Works beautifully,"Does what it says. Very little interference on the signal from my Zune, really reproduces the sound well. Highly recommended."
4,"Very Good Sound, But didn't last long","I have been using this with both the video ipod and the ipod nano. The sound quality is very good -- much better than the other options.Everything worked fine until about two weeks ago when I couldn't get the music on the ""Left"" side speakers in the car. And finally a couple of days ago, the ""Right"" channel also went dead. It worked fine for about two months -- and it was good when it was working.All in all, for the price and the sound quality you get, its good -- even if it only lasted for two months. It would have been awesome if it lasted longer -- but I don't think I will complain too much about it. I plan to buy another one to replace my dead one."
4,Negligible click sound on toyota camry 2004,"It works in a 2004 toyota camry with a constant click sound. If you turn up the volume enough, the click sound is negligible though."
4,simply works,"This does what it is supposed to do. That's a good thing. And since I don't particularly like the Sony brand overall, it's high praise coming from me."
1,Disappointed,"Based on online reviews and Sony's reputation for quality, I eagerly bought this adapter to play in my car. Sadly, all I hear is static unless I turn up the volume extremely loud and then I get LOUD static with faint music in the background."
5,Better than the radio frequency adaptors!,"My wife has a tape deck in her car and I do not. This thing produces high quality and better performance than the radio frequency adaptors. If you have a tape deck, I would highly recommend this product."
3,Does not work well with the iPOD.,The volume is very low regardless of what you set the stereo or the iPod to.
2,Doesn't work as well as my older Sony Discman cassette adapter,"I have an older Sony cassette adapter that came w/ a Discman bundle from around 1996. This worked great, but now the cable connection at the jack for the line-out port of the Discman is getting loose.I purchased this w/ the intention of replacing that adapter. Everything about the product seems identical, but for some reason, it doesn't work as well or doesn't work at all in either of my car cassette decks (Subaru and Oldsmobile Bose system). It either sticks, and can't eject, or doesn't play, etc. Can't figure out the problem. The old adapter still works, so it's not my deck.I've run into this problem w/ a cheaper adapter, but thought I would have better luck w/ this more expensive Sony model. Looks like nothing works better than the original..."
4,Good but not Great,Sounds like satellite radio; Wish it would sound like those iPod integration systems on new cars or cars with a mp3 input
1,Stops working in one month,"I don't know if this particularly happens on my item, but mine stops working in one month! The volume is dramatically decreased. Music can be heard if I turn the volume up, but the noise is very strong if I do so."
1,Short lifespan,"I've gone through a number of cassette adapters in the last ten years, but this particular model had by far the shortest lifespan. The cord gave out within two months, leaving me with sound only through the right channel. The cord's exit point is too low on the cassette, meaning that it will be bent by any ""drop in"" car cassette deck. The unit also has a decent amount of operating noise. I'll avoid Sony cassette adapters in the future."
1,Couldn't hear a thing!,"This is being returned. Volume on both mp3 player, and car radio at max. All you hear was a whisper!I really wanted it to work, since it was a gift!"
3,It is cheap and it works.,"I use this in my tape player for my generation 1 and Shuffle iPods and it functions adequately. It allows me to listen to my music and podcasts in my Subaru. That is the most important thing. The unit itself was about $6. The chord is about 20 gauge, very flimsy and is about three feet longer than required. Their is alot of background noise (even at low gain levels), and cyclic interference that comes from using a tape-head device. It does not have rewind or direction problems that other units that I have used in the past had. During cold weather it functions with more chatter but once it warms up, the racket goes away. The bottom line is that using any tape player to play an iPod in a car is inherantly ""noisy,"" but using a $6 device allows me to use $500 worth of MP3 players that would otherwise collect dust."
5,Works better than FM Transmitter,This cassette worked great and sounds fine. Amazing how old technology is still better than the new :)
2,Two failed after 4 months,"I bought one of the Sony adapter for my wife for her iPOD to listen to music in her car. Then, a month later I bought one for myself to listen to audio books in my car with my Creative Zen. Both worked as expected at first. Last month, my wife commented that her unit would no longer stay in her player. It was constantly being ejected. She stopped using hers. This month, mine unit started doing the same thing and then started causing the tape player in my vehicle to auto reverse. This unit only passes audio to the player when on the ""A"" side so when the player reverses to the ""B"" side all audio stops. We are very disappointed. We purchased the Sony because it has good average reviews on Amazon and we normally expect good quality from Sony. I believe that the mechanics just wore out after only 4 months of use."
2,Poor sound quality,"It gets the job done in a pinch, but there are some songs that I can't listen to in the car because of the poor quality and white noise-like sounds. I will typically only use this on long trips as the noise on the highway can drown out some of the scratchy-ness.Overall, I wish I had just paid the extra money for one at an electronics store."
3,Low budget FM,"spend the extra $$ and have a hard wired connection, about 35.00. This works OK but you have to do some adjustments with your volume and eq to get rid off the hissing. Much better than wireless however. Not all cassette players will work with this unit. Better than the Monster cassette FM."
4,"Old school, but works well","This was state-of-the-art back in 1989, but works just as well today. I'm using it to connect an iPod to my car stereo. It takes literally no setup time, the sound quality is surprisingly good, and I haven't had any issues with it. Better value for the money than the >$100 wireless radio connectors for an iPod."
3,"Works, but may cause problems with MP3 player attached","I've had this since November 2010 so over one and a half years and use it in my 2001 Jeep Grand Cherokee. I play music out of my HTC Inspire 4G and it has played music clearly and fairly consistently. BUT in the past year, when I plug my phone into the 3.5mm jack with the Walkman (Sony) Cassette to MP3 adapter, it causes my phone to turn on voice dial and usually calls the last person I called. It gets very irritating as it doesn't happen so often and I have to stop the car and figure out what is happening. I use headphones and other speakers with my phone and this is the only thing that does this to my phone. I recently got a iPod which has generally solved the problem, but it skips songs occasionally on the iPod Video 30gb I have. One final note is that it rarely, but sometimes makes a grinding sound which is usually solved by simply ejecting it, waiting a moment, and putting it back in the player."
4,"Great reference, but not the end all be all...","This is a fine book, detailing the history of the Essex class and the roles that each of the vessels played in a particular engagment. There is a great ammount of detailed information on each of the vessles, but not a lot of photographs. There is ""some"" information about the background and developement of these ships, but if you want a real picture of how these (and all ships came to be in WWII) then I would point you in the direction of ""The Unsinkable Fleet"". If you're just looking for a quick and dirty read on the Essex's and the roles they playing in history, then grab this handy little gem. I only paid $0.63 for my perfect conditioned used copy, and it was well worth every penny."
3,Not on a par with his best,"OK, and better than many current mysteries, but this is not as good as The Three Coffins, The Problem of the Green Capsule, The Case of the Constant Suicides, et al. The international criminal plot line wasn't that interesting to me, and the whole thing seemed a little farfetched. I prefer his locked rooms. Save this one for near the bottom of the pile if you are working your way through all his novels."
4,Good starting point but Maps can be updated,I loved this book. Maps did not turn out to be what I expected but overall I am very satisfied with the content of the book. An updated edition is a must for a book like this.
5,"Well-illustrated, breadth of coverage, convenient format","I'm obviously reviewing a different book from the first review.My book is 6 X 8 or so, beautifully photographed and printed (color only) on good stock, easy to carry around, perfect for browsing but equally lucid for reading from the beginning. The global breadth of coverage is astonishing so that you can find a succinct description of brioche and chapatis, but also spelt and the raw materials which become bread. A gem -- I haven't seen anything like it (the other books in this Cook's Encyclopedia have similar virtues). The recipes are convenient and doubtless fine for a first effort.For breadies, this isn't a technical book on breadmaking, so look elsewhere. That's not the authors' intention. Unfortunately, many reviewers review the book they imagine in their minds as being the book they want to read, not what the author has set out to write."
2,Very average soundtrack for an underrated movie,"The film was unjustly attacked by critics, but it still was a good adaption of the novel and was visually stunning. The soundtrack is nothing special, just average retro-rock punk of these days and in my opinion trash. Ice-T doesn't appear here once, dont ask me why. Perhaps he thought this was a waste of time too, which would be a good career move anyway. Dont buy this, watch the movie instead."
5,Great!!!,"I'm glad Universal has released Psycho 2 and 3 and in 16:9 Widescreen.I have always loved The Psycho movies and I thought Anthony Perkins was a great actor,it's so sad that he's no longer with us.I hope Universal will update the orginal classic for 16:9 TV's soon,the first release of Pyscho was not bad but it could of been alot better,the Laserdisc version got a THX transfer,why not the same for DVD? I remember seeing Pyscho 2 for the first time when I was kid and I remember being on the Edge of my seat.Great Movie!! I dont think 3 was as good as 2.And you think at the end of 3 that Norman would never be released from the mental ward ever again,but he does for 1 more Psycho movie Pyscho IV:The Begining,I hope Universal will release that movie as well on DVD,you get to see Henry Thomas as a Teenage Norman Bates.Great stuff!"
5,throw out that Good Times release...,"Although Universal's release gives you nothing in the way of extras, widescreen TV owners get a much needed 1:85:1 anamorphic widescreen transfer with Dolby 4.0 surround for a true home theater experience."
5,A VERY GOOD SEQUEL TO THE GREATEST FILM EVER MADE!,"Psycho II is a very suspensefull sequel to the original. Picking up where Hitchcock left off, Anthony Perkins returns as Norman Bates, who has been declared sane after spending 22 years in a asylum. Norman returns home to the Bates Motel. A young woman, who is the daughter of Marion Crane's sister is sent by her mother to make a frendship with Norman and keep a watchful eye on him because she believes he is still insane. Strange things begin to happen as Norman slowly becomes his old self again. A very entertaining film directed by Richard Franklin. This is a must-have for any Psycho or horror fan! The last 5 minutes of this film are scary and hilarious. A scary, suspenseful, and funny romp!"
3,where is the set?????????,Why don't they Release a Box Set??? I think its safe to say the series has Ended.
3,"great action, ok suspense and a great ending",I thought PSYCHO 2 was a great movie. The acting by Anthany Perkins was great. PSYCHO 2 is double the kills and gore of PSYCHO.
3,"Wake up, the sequel's here","After 22 years of imprisonment, Norman Bates is set free. As he tries to start a new life, he begins hearing his mother's voice telling him what to do and finding notes and little surprises everywhere. And then, people start turning up dead. But who's doing it? Great sequel is livened up by the bodycount where in the first, drug it down. And the killer is not a disappointment either. If the original bored you..."
1,"When you follow a master, you better have more than this...","Anthony Perkins returns in his role as the most famous serial killer in cinema (with the possible exception of Hannibal Lecter). Seeing him on screen again certainly strikes a chord, especially when he is filmed together with his famous residence. But the pleasures of ""Psycho II"" end there. This film is too heavy on plot, full of implausible coincidence and unnatural reactions. Director Richard Franklin and screenwriter Tom Holland rely heavily on iconic images from the original, but they have nothing to back it up with./"
3,"""I'm home Mother!""","Norman Bates is back in this surprisingly good sequel. It continues 22 years after the previous film and consists of Bates being declared 'sane' and allowed to return home. But some people won't let him rest and soon Bates finds himself losing his mind again, or is someone framing him? Is mother really dead? or is Norman just still a 'psycho'? All though this film is nothing compared to the first, it is definitely worth a look..."
4,It's Happening.....Again!,"Anthony Perkins is the quintessential Norman Bates.The movie differs greatly from the book. So, if you've read Psysho II the novel by Robert Bloch, the movie is totally, and I mean totally, different. Personally, I think it would be great to see another movie mimic the book as Hitchcock did with the original Psycho, but with Anthony Perkins gone, why bother.The movie is well-filmed and it is interesting to see the Psycho house and, for that matter, Norman in color. Norman has returned home and taken charge once again of the Bates Motel. It is only a matter of hours it seems before 'mother' begins to bother him again. It starts off a little slow, but quickly builds, just as the body count does.Vera Miles reprises her role and Meg Tilly gives us an added bonus feature during the shower scene. This makes up for no bonus features on the DVD, besides the trailer that is."
5,A Great Part II For The Classic Original,Psycho II is a great movie. What happens when a mentally ill man who has killed in the past is released back into the very community where the murders were committed? Well just take a gander at this movie and find out. Some folks accept Norman Bates but others have plans for him. Who can he trust? Does he deserve a second chance? This dvd release is in widescreen and looks great.
3,Norman Bates undergoes Rehabilitation,"""Psycho II"" starts off well. We get a change of perspective, as Norman Bates becomes the unlikely hero of the piece while others lacking objectivity try to undermine his rehabilitation. We actually sympathize with Bates thanks to Anthony Perkins' performance and Jerry Goldsmith's touching score. The film however falls apart in the final third as in reverts to horror mentality and a totally improbable ending. Too Bad! In any event I don't think Alfred Hitchcock would have approved."
3,"Gory, but suspensful!","Richard Franklin has done a good job on this movie.Actually worthy sequal to the original hit. And it's actually suspensful! Could do out with the blood and the otherwise silly conclusion, though."
4,Pretty good...,"This was a good second installment of psycho. Ofcourse I never really fell in love with the psycho series. Never really cared to. I doubt I will purchase the third installment. I just wanted to atleast see the second movie in the series. If your into the psycho franchise, then get this move, otherwise just rent it."
4,ONE THING-IT ROCKS!!...,"I saw this movie on encore once back when I was a psycho freak. After I saw it, I found out that it was my favorite psycho movie. I suggest you buy this movie, or DVD. It's one of the best psycho movies. I should know. I've seen all five of them. You won't be disappointed! It's also one of the most suspenseful movies ever. There's one part when he's sitting in a chair, you know, Anthony Perkins, and... Well, I don't wanna ruin it for you. I just suggest you get the DVD soon, like me. You ain't gonna disagree with me. I hope not."
4,Great sequal!,"Well made follow up to the 1960 smash hit finds Norman Bates comming home and re-opening Bates Hotel. But im only giving it 4 stars becuas it comes to a silly conclusion. Also, it manages to go without the typical 80's gore until the end."
4,Anthony Perkins make sit work. Film very suspensful.,"Psycho is a classic and no film can measure up to it in the slasher dept not even Halloween, This sequel has Norman bATES being released from prison after 22 years. he has ben brain washed of all his memories. He does not remmeber his mother or the murders, He is ashell but slightly neurotic and scary one. Lila Loomis Marion Cranes sisiter wants Norman back in prison. fUNNY how so manpeople want nORMAN TO GO CRAZY THAT THRY END UP DOIGN SOME pretyy sick things, You never really know until the ned who the killer is. The cinematagrophy and acting is good all around."
2,"it was good, but it isn't worth owning.","This film was played on the USA network at 2 in the morning last month, and it was a very good horror movie, going for scares instead of gross outs (I'm a fan of both kinds of horror), but the story is so unbelievable that it brings it down a nothch or two. If you want to see this film, by all means do so, but I really would'nt see the point of owning it, unless you must own all the Psychos. It's always a bad sign, when instead of the whole movie entertaining you, only a few scenes do, but when these scenes are as enjoyable as they are in Psycho 2, it is a recommended viewing."
1,matthew,these dvd is waste of money it about level bad b movie produce nothing real special about it
4,"Good, but perhaps not more than that","The DVD has much of useful information, but I have not particularly liked the ""staging"" of the video: a couple watching some film and then trying by themselves. Long at times and the actors are not particularly attractive neither, at least to my taste."
2,Great for a man that wants to please his partner.,"First off this video was a throw back from the early '90's. The setting was cheap looking. But, it mostly focused on a woman enjoying her massage. Honestly, the stuff in there was nothing new. I don't even know why I bought it."
3,This is quite good,This has a couple of interesting tips and is actually really quite good especially if you are really new to it.
3,not pleased with the video. very basic material.,i was not pleased with the content.it lacked a lot. info was very basic.i would not buy it if it was to do over.
1,Rusty little kettle,"I used this tea kettle for just over a month before I had to throw it out. The reason is that it started to develop a ring of rust on the inside where the bottom meets the side. The ""stainless steel"" label is simply false advertising. The appearance, size, and whistling all looked great initially, but the rusting makes this an unusable product. Avoid at all cost."
1,Does Not Whistle,"Had a Copco teakettle for years and worked great. Unfortunately, we somehow lost the cover to it. Thus, ordered the Copco Escort. Two problems - difficult to remove the cover as there is no place to insert one's finger into the cover's plastic handle to remove it. Even worse, it does not whistle, making it very dangerous. I note that two other Amazon reviewers also report a weak or ""no whistle"" problem with the Copco Mirage. Thus, something appears to be wrong with this line of Copco teakettles."
1,Deteriorated Before Our Eyes,"I wish I had read these reviews before we bought this little tea kettle.As we took it out of its box we discovered that the handle of the 1st one we bought was split in half so we exchanged it for another. Too bad we didn't see that broken handle as an omen that this was a product of very poor quality. We've owned this yes, cute and tiny, kettle for less than 6 weeks and in this brief time the whistle has broken; the exterior has discolored to an odd copper color that no soap or scrubbing can remove; and worst of all, the plastic casing around the spout cover that contains the whistle has simply melted off -- every time it's used little black bits of plastic melt into a dribble down the side of the kettle and into the stove burner.Hate to be harsh but this is a piece of junk. The only good from it is that it reminded us that it always pays to get quality. And this isn't."
2,Looks good but doesn't whistle,"The Copco tea kettle looks as good as I had hoped. However, just as another reviewer mentioned, it whistled loudly once and that was it. You really need to be alert to the steam coming from the spout to be sure that the water in the kettle doesn't evaporate.I guess looks aren't everything."
2,Great Size... So So Quality,"I love the size of this kettle. For a single person, the size is perfect. However, it begins to turn a copper color within a few months of use. I don't have some of the problems that people mention in the reviews, such as melting plastic or rusting but I agree that no amount of scrubbing will get this tea kettle to come clean of this copper color. The whistle always worked for me. If you don't mind an ugly tea kettle, then I think it is alright. But my tea kettle sits out everyday on my stove.Another issue that I don't like is the handle gets hot enough where I need to use a pot holder or kitchen towel. Not a big deal but just an added annoyance."
2,Not enough zing for a highly engaging subject,"I was seeking an answer to the question, ""Who is spying on me and how?"" The modern workplace at large corporations, like mine, has changed. Technology pervades almost every communication and personal encounter. Am I being tape-recorded by my peers? How is my internet usage tracked and is it used to create a profile of my behavior? How can I use these tools to keep current? Are we crossing the line into paranoia? These questions are not answered, but are captivating to me. Anecdotes seem to ingratiate those involved, rather than communicate effective counter-tactics."
2,Not very good,"The author tries to convey that he is communicating with nature(water, rocks, etc.) but in the end you are just left wondering ""what is this?"" In other words, the way that ""nature"" speaks is not very convincing. I don't recommend it."
5,Return of a Great,"Ronin Warriors--known as Yoroiden Samurai Troopers to those of us who prefer subs--is without a doubt my all-time favorite series, and I can't tell you how pleased I am to see a bilingual DVD at long last. The subtitles are a welcome change from the dub, the quality is clearer than that seen on television, and everything that makes it great is here. I have a few beefs with some of the name romanizations and armor name/virtue translations(for example, Seiji's kanji REI is translated as 'Grace' rather than 'Courtesy', which I feel is more correct), but these are minor complaints and I have to recommend this DVD to anyone who loves action, fantasy, anime, or all of the above."
5,There is so much more we could understand,"Animals have magnificent powers of communication. I'm convinced of it. We humans just have not taken the time to ask them questions. All too often we treat all animals as livestock, here on earth as decorations or food. Again and again I've seen people make amazing communications with their pets, ones you wouldn't think pets were capable of -- because we have to change our thoughts about animals. We are the weak ones because we have cognition and communication skills but have not chosen to bring out the same skills in animals. For more on these kinds of ideas I would recommend Paws & Effect: The Healing Power of Dogs, which shows how amazing dogs can predict heart attacks and diagnose cancer. The book shows that probably all dogs can do these things -- we just haven't asked them. Animals are amazing."
5,Alex and Me,"I have followed Irene Pepperburg's articles on her African Grey Parrot, Alex, for years, both learning and teaching my own African Greys with her methods. I was so happy to see her write this book as her own personal tribute to Alex who was not just a lab specimen but a friend as well. Thank you, Irene. Alex will be missed by many."
3,A bit too technical for my tastes...,"Yes, the intelligence and ability of parrots to communicate concepts IS interesting. But wow! This book has far too much technical detail to keep me turning pages. I bought the book to learn about how Alex was trained and how he progressed through the training. But the book goes into too much detail about Pepperberg's scientific and psychological study to keep me awake. Certainly not bedtime reading. I only wish she'd written the book I wanted to read."
1,Too technical!,I read Alex & Me first and I'm glad I did. This 'studies' book is NOT for the lay person as it is very scientific and technical. I read one page and put it back on Amazon. Unless you want to duplicate these studies you probably will not enjoy this book.
5,Great history of the creation of Oklahoma City,"No community in the world had an origin coparable to that of Oklahoma City. There will never be a simliar story. Conditions under which it was born no longer exist. From noon to nightfall on April 22, 1889, when the Unassigned Lands of Oklahoma Country were opened, people by the thousands poured into Oklahoma Station on the Santa Fe Railroad."
1,Didn't work,"I installed this card in my Dell Dimension 4300 computer running Windows XP Home, and it immediately started acting funky. Some things were so weird that it's hard to know what happened, like my computer sponaneously booting from an OFF state - I've never seen that before. When I tried to actually use the new USB ports, the computer froze. I removed it and everything looks OK again. If you need high-speed USB, try something else."
5,turn table stylus review,the stylus came packaged very well and protected. quality and price was right on track. will recommend for anyone to use this vendor and item.
5,So much Nightwish...,"I'm not really gonna go into depth on this one, but its great. 4 Nightwish albums, with new cookies (the front of the cd), when you put them all together it makes the face of Tarja, the lead female singer, which i think is pretty cool. All the albums are great and this thing is definetely worth the money. If you're a Nightwish fan, get this."
1,Waste of money.,"This band can't sing, write, compose and sound friggin awful. Don't waste your money, avoid."
2,don't bother if you want a functioning whistle,"This kettle is the perfect size for us and has a nice brushed finish. HOWEVER, the whistle is junk. It crumbled to pieces within a month of buying it new. The seller gave me a new one from another kettle, and that one crumbled to pieces in an even shorter period of time. I'm trying to find a way to contact the manufacturer. Would like to replace this 1-1/4"" whistle with one that actually works."
3,problem with whistle,"Some months ago, the whistle (small black cover for spout) broke in spite of careful use. I called a customer service number which at this time I am no longer able to reach. (1 888 203 8462) and was sent without charge a new item. This too has proven inferior and I now do not know how to reach the customer service department at COPCO. CAN YOU PLEASE PROVIDE ME WITH A NUMBER? THE NAME OF THE SPECIFIC KETTLE IS RADIUS, POLISHED STAINLESS STEEL."
2,Not as nice as I hoped,"I read a poor review on this product and I regret not taking the reviewer's advice as it was right on. The product takes a alot of monking around to set it up and then although it does make a nice straight line you still need tape. Also, if you have a popcorn ceiling it doesn't have a smooth edge to work from. Then having to purchase refill to use it on another project?, well, just not worth it. I agree with the review I didn't listen to.....""don't bother."""
1,Ziba roller review,This is not a professional or even handyman tool. It is not of professional grade. Even when being extremely careful it dispenses too much paint which causes runs or uneven line. It is designed to be used one time which makes it to expensive for a one time use. This should be priced at $5.00 to make it any kind of value. I found that that the rollers did not roll freely which caused the tool to slide and deposit an uneven layer of paint. Because of this I had to repaint much of what I painted with this tool. I do not reccomend this tool at all.
3,Overpriced given the performance,"We got this at our local ""Depot"" since we're still waiting on our ""PointnPaint"" 2 weeks later. Our biggest gripe is the metal edger scrapes the wall and leaves marks. So we've had to adapt to using the plastic side even if it wasn't the most natural of positions to do so. If they made the steel wheel plastic, it would resolve this issue. Tray works fine, rollers were fine, allowed us to get as close to the ceiling as possible without getting the other color on it. Would recommend as long as people were aware of the issue with the scratch potential."
2,Loved it at first,To begin with I was so in love with this product for edges. Did exactly what it said. Loved the tray and the swivel head. Then it begin leaving black marks on the wall. I have contacted the manufacturers website and left feedback. Because of this problem it is next to useless unless I put pressure only on the side without the metal. I am going to try and put tape over the metal to see if I can still get some use from the product. Five stars without this problems.
4,ignore the 'black stripe' complains,"I ordered this product despite the bad reviews because of the 'black stripes' the roller leaves behind.When I received the product had started laughing. The roller has a side (with plastic spacers) which should face the trim and a side which is made of metal. The roller rotates 180degrees, so the trim-side can be left or right. Proper usage of it will solve the 'black stripe problem' immediately.The one part I really don't like is that you can't order just a new set of rollers. We're all trying to be a bit ""greener"", it would be nice if the manufacturers would help us..."
3,Not so bad,"I read the negative reviews but I opened it anyway. You know what though. This thing isn't that terrible. Biggest concern, yes, is the black line the metal edge can make. I kinda took it easy and it wasn't that bad. Yeah, ceiling with popcorn, etc. would be a problem, I guess. But for my purposes, it's worked great. Look, I don't want to tape off a 50' section of wall, so ... I'm kinda digging it.Biggest concern is how long the roller will last. I just washed mine. I'll try to get multiple uses out of it. Will try to update this as I go."
3,"Good at some things, bad at others","This edger did well for me in some instances and not well in others. It is very good for edging right against windows and wood trim. It did not do well against the ceiling because the black metal part leaves a black scratch on the ceiling where it touches.For small spots that my regular roller won't fit, the edger was perfect.The little rollers hold a good amount of paint and the whole apparatus was very easy to use. I washed my entire set, rollers and all and got a second use out of the rollers, although they are supposed to be thrown away.I like that it pivots around so you can use it with either hand.Essentially this edger does about half of what is should do."
1,Don't waste your money,"I have never written a review before, but I feel I need to alert people so they don't waste money or ruin their ceilings and woodwork. I bought this because it was marked down. It looked pretty nifty. I would be even more disappointed if I had paid full price. I ended up having to go out and buy tape anyway because this is a horrible product. A metal edge scrapes paint off your woodwork and the ceiling line is horrible. Do yourself a favor and don't make the same mistake I did. Buy the Shur-Line Premium Paint Edger for a great and cheap ceiling edger and tape your woodwork. This product is also messy and has way too many parts that need to be replaced with subsequent paint projects."
3,Historical Fiction,"Here's something different: a Dracula movie with no vampires! Based on the life and legends of Vlad Tepes, the Wallachian prince known as Vlad the Impaler, this film is a lavish historical spectacle with strong production values. Unfortunately, the full-frame presentation robs the DVD transfer of some of the impact it might have had in widescreen. As for the story, it falls just short of the kind of rousing dark epic the producers were aiming for. The character of Dracula is almost sympathetic, and the film doesn't try to explain away his brutality with simplistic rationalizations, but the end result lacks real impact. However it's worth watching for hard-core Dracula fans, and Roger Daltrey's portrayal of the King of Hungary is striking to say the least (I never would have guessed it was him!). If you're looking for a real horror movie, this probably won't fit the bill for you, but the film makers deserve a few points for trying something off beat."
2,This is not a historical drama!,"It's a drama, and it does follow, VERY roughly, the events of Vlad's life. I realize you can't put a whole life into the time frame of a movie. But this is full of major inconsistencies. I would recommend this movie, WITH RESERVATIONS, to somebody who already knows the truth about Vlad's life from an imartial source and who also enjoys beautiful settings and passable to good acting. Most of it was pleasant to watch.And WHY did they depict this man without a moustache? It's his most distinguishing feature. They should have had the moustache even if it meant giving up the high cheekbones.I think the Immortal Life ending was a mistake, and the cover is misleading in the extreme. And it's not even a spoiler for me to say this, because the cover would otherwise lead one to believe it was a vampire flick. There is no hint of vampirism in the final scene."
3,Dark Prince: The true story of Dracula,"Originally airing on USA Tv Network, Dark Prince is the story of ""Dracula's"" early life and the events which twisted him. Certainly not the most cutting edge movie, but if you're interested in a dark film with a new take on an old story, this is your best bet."
5,Doesn't get any better than this!,"Malone & Malone have written an excellent exploration of intimacy and its dynamics. As a therapist, I have recommended this book year after year for those who can benefit from a higher level of reading than most self-help or consumer-focused books. I recommend to both clients and therapists without reservation!"
2,Not sure I understand what all the talk is about,"I was recommended this book by someone I trust, but after I purchased it and spoke to him about it, he realized he had recommended the wrong book. A little late as I am having trouble even understanding the point of the work. If I am reading a ""self help"" book, I want to know what my problem is and how this book is going to help me. Then I want to dive right into the helping me part. Either I didn't read long enough or there is no sense to all the psycho babble in this book."
5,Great Book,"I found the ideas in this book to be very accesible to the student with little mathematics experience (as I have). It is very straight foward, contains illuminating example problems, and even has an application section at the end of each chapter. Many abstract algebra books assume that you can prove anything. However, Gilbert's book focuses on the techniques of learning how to prove."
2,Not the Dr. Scholl's I am accustomed to,"I really love Dr. Scholls products because of their style and comfort. I was excited to receive these sandals for that reason, but was very dissapointed in the comfort. They are very high on style, but are not very comfortable like all of my other Dr. Scholls. For that reason, I can wear them for only a limited amount of time and can't walk around in them alot like my other Dr. Scholls and do not give them a very high rating. These shoes are supposed to be comfortable!"
2,"It was good to hear Bettie's voice, but...","I was disappointed with Dave Stevens' interviewing techniques.If you are an avid fan of Bettie's as I am, it is worth having this CD to hear her speak of her past.I commend Dave Stevens' effort in having this product; however I found his questions too repetitive. Bettie she would answer his question. He would then reword the query further down the track. He could have taken better advantage of having this opportunity with Bettie.If he used this technique to get more information from Bettie, he should have gone about it differently. I'm not trying to say that without the repetition it would cut the time down by half. It would have saved Bettie saying ""Like I said..."" and the listener thinking ""You've already asked that question!"""
5,Bettie Page Forever,"Is was a wonderful experience to actually hear Bettie Page's voice being interviewed by late artist great, Dave Stevens. This is a wonderful CD, and surely a worthwhile item to own for any Bettie Page aficionado."
5,THIS ALBUM GROWS & GROWS ON YOU,"Some things get better with time. Vitalogy sounds better and more diverse as time goes by. I own every PJ album & its hard to say which is ""best"" and which is ""worst"". My favorite album and songs are always changing from a band of this talent. Vitalogy is definelty one of thier finest achievements."
5,ARTISTIC Pearl Jam,"Vitlaogy is a very good album. Despite some reviews, I believe this is one of Pearl Jam's best albums. It has it's own technic and sound. The entire cd has a great quality that you can not stop listening to. It has some great songs like ""Nothingman"" and ""betterman"". If you like pearl Jam, then get this cd. It's an excellent choice.HeyMitchum@hotmail.com"
2,GOING DOWN THE TUBES,"After hearing the excellent album ""Ten"" and the good album ""Versus"", this is really dissappointing. I think the only redeeming songs on this album are ""Not For You"" and ""Better Man"". The rest is just crap......especially ""Bugs"". I laughed at it when I first heard it because it was so pathetic. Well, at least Pearl Jam gave us some good music before this piece of garbage."
5,"OBVIOUSLY SOME OF YOU PEOPLE ARE SLOW, SO GET THIS THROUGH YOUR HEAD","'Immortality' was not inspired by Kurt Cobain in any way, shape, or form.The music and majority of lyrics were written before Kurt Cobain died.Eddie Vedder, the man who wrote the song , you fools, has said this song was NOT inspired by Kurt Cobain. He SAID that.""WOW!!!!!!!! PEARL JAM HAD A SONG ABOUT DEATH WHEN KURT COBAIN DIED!!! IT MUST BE ABOUT KURT COBAIN!!!BECAUSE PEARL JAM NEVER DID THAT BEFORE!!! THE SONG ""FOOTSTEPS"" IN 1991, THAT'S NOT ABOUT DEATH! NOPE! THE SONG ""DEEP"" ON THE ALBUM TEN, THAT'S NOT ABOUT DEATH!! NOPE!HEY!! THE SONG GLORIFIED G OFF OF ""VS"" IS ABOUT HAND GUNS! KURT COBAIN LOVED HAND GUNS!!! WHICH *MUST* MEAN THAT GLORIFIED G IS ABOUT KURT COBAIN TOO!!!!""Get it through your f__king heads already."
2,Only 2 songs worth listening to,"I know everyone loves Ten, and I'm for one sick of it. However it's just a fact, Ten is their best album. That album is wickedly good. And Vitalogy, is their worst. I loved the concept and even some of the music, but because lyrics are important to me I didnt find this album to have the passion and strength displayed in Ten.Trying not to compare the two I rebrought the album and gave it a chance. Corduroy, my favorite, is addictive and a magnificent song. Better man is good as well. However, outside of these, I couldn't get into the album. Especially Bugs, I hated it. Spin the Black Circle just didnt need to be on this album. I understand the band means well, but it just didnt go well. They didnt revive until Yield in my opinion."
4,Half and Half,"Eight great songs, two mediocre (Whipping, Satan's Bed) and four utter pieces of garbage they should be embarrassed to record (Pry, To, Bugs, Aye Davanita and Stupid Mop). Why not just put together 10 or 11 really good songs with no filler? This is still a classic album I guess, but it also marks the beginning of Pearl Jam 's downward spiral."
1,What ...were they thinking?,"After I heard Ten, I thought that Pearl Jam were one of the best bands ever. After I listened to Vitalogy, I completely changed my mind. Pearl Jam should be ashamed of themselves of making such a ...[bad]album. It's a disgrace to grunge music and themselves. Four of these songs are absolutely pointles, one with Eddie Vedder talking about bugsthat are all over his body and wondering if he should kill them, eat them or befriend. Dude, get a freakin life.The sad thing is, although this album ...[is horrible], these dudes are very talented. It's just sad that they changed their style after Ten.... Avoid this album at all costs."
1,what happened?,"I'm a really big fan of pearl jam's first two album. Upon hearing this album, I was really disapointed. Better man is a pretty good song, but the rest just really poorly done. Songs like bugs and spin the black circle make you wonder what happened to these masters of early 90s hard rock."
1,Less Than Zero - Squared,Yet another terrible album by yet another bunch of psuedo-angry American musicians with their psuedo-angry heads buried up their own mammy-pampered-bummies. Adolescent wank for pimple faced boys with fluffy goatees.I am traumatised. I dread meeting people who like this album.
3,not as good as Ten and Vs but good hard rock,i am a great fan and i started my collection with Ten and i loved the group but when i bought Vitalogy i got disappointed because is not as good as Ten and Vs and some songs are totally ridiculous.
4,Good but weird,"A great, although strange album. Betterman and Corduroy are the best songs on the album, and most of the rest are all good too, but it's a little bit on the weird side compared to the band's other recordings. Bugs is just stupid and should've never been recorded. But other than a few of the songs it's great and is a must-buy for any PJ fan."
4,I don't think this is bad at all,"People criticise this album way too much. It's just that it was where PJ proved to be experimential. I can see where you'd hate this, but I like it better than Vs., though not quite as much as Ten. This album has hit songs like ""Better Man"" along with the other greats like ""Whipping"" and ""Stupid Mop"". It shows Pearl Jam at different heights, as do their other albums. I think that if Creed was good to you that you should think this is EXCELLENT! I like it a lot, even though not everyone does."
4,Pearl Jam's worst record is still pretty good,"This is Pearl Jam's foruth record, and their worst. However, it is by far the most alternative of their records. Featuring an eclectic mix of songs, Vitalogy is based on several great songs, with filler in between. Mind you, this is high quality filler, but it's still filler. ""Not For You,"" stands out as the record's best and most interesting song. Vedder is in top form on this cut, and is partickullarly angry. His anger is complemented by great guitar and drum work by the band. ""Betterman,"" is another of the showcased songs here, and is just barely surpassed by ""Not For You,"" as the best track on the record. ""Betterman,"" is a fun song to listen to, and is atypical Pearl Jam, and a welcome break from the darkness and anger on the rest of this record. Though it is their only 4 star record (all the others being 5 stared), Vitalogy is still a good investment of your $15"
4,Vitalogy,"If you are just discovering pearl jam, this album is not for you at first. It still has some rock tunes like SPIN THE BLACK CIRCLE, CORDUROY, LAST EXIT, SATAN'S BED, NOT FOR YOU, BETTER MAN, WHIPPING. There is some experiemental stuff on here, like BUGS, AYE DAVAITA, PRY TO, and FOXYMOP HANDLE ITS ME. One other hit is TREMOR CHRIST, it charted at number 18 on the hot 100 but is now largely forgotten. But I do recomend buying this after you buy their first two records TEN and VS"
5,Vitalogy (Vinyl Edition Remastered),"Vitalogy, Pearl Jam's third studio recording is, in my opinion, their best album. And this new remastered vinyl edition is the best version of it one could wish for. A definitive edition!"
4,Vitalogy,"When I first bought this CD, I put it in my stereo, listened to it once, and banished it to my shelf for 6 months. A few days ago I pulled it out and gave it another listen, and it was amazing. From the angry, dissonant Not for You to the beautiful Immortality, this album is amazing. It does have a few missteps, though--the strange accordian track Bugs and the last track, Hey Foxymophaldomama (I didn't spell that correctly). Although this album is truly amazing and contains some of Pearl Jam's best songs, overall, it's not quite their best (let's hear it for Vs.)."
3,Has anyone else noticed that...,"""Spin The Black Circle"" blatantly rips off Husker Du's ""Beyond The Threshold""?"
2,"4 songs great, 10 songs terrible","I love ""Corduroy,"" and ""Not For You,"" ""Better Man,"" and ""Immortality"" belong on a hypothetical Best-of collection, but the rest is a confused, disjointed mess. It's impossible to listen to this one from beginning to end."
3,Just doesn't live up to Ten,"This would be pretty good CD if it had come from another band, or if it had come before Ten and Vs. I guess that it isn't really fair to compare this album to Ten or Vs.; it would be hard for anyone to live up to the expectations that those CDs left behind. Vitalogy does have some good tunes like ""Corduroy"", ""Better Man"", ""Spin the Black Circle"", and ""Nothingman"", but the other songs just don't get it. ""Bugs"" is a waste of 3 minutes, and ""Aye Davanita(sp?)"" doesn't offer much in the way of aesthetic value. If you really like Pearl Jam, then you should get this CD, but I'm warning you; don't expect another Ten."
1,This Album Began Their Slide into Mediocrity...,"On Ten, Stone and Jeff wrote the music and Eddie wrote the lyrics. The result was one of the greatest albums of all time. Pearl Jam had a great recipe for success and great songs; I still wonder to this day why in the world would they threw all of that away? Vitalogy is the album where Eddie took over all aspects of the band and wrote over-simplistic songs with cheesy riffs that sounded like they came from a 3rd rate garage band. One of my friends said it best back in the day, ""They need to take the guitar away from Eddie"". Sadly, they never did..."
4,Their best?,"First off, I only give 5 stars for a select few albums, so don't be fooled by my 4 star rating. This album took Pearl Jam into a completely different direction, and thank goodness. Although Ten, and to a greater extent VS. are great albums, they would have been wearing thin creatively had they tried to hold to the grunge style that dominates those two albums. ""Nothingman"" is a beautiful, balladesque piece that works better than anything similar they'd attempted before. Straight ahead rockers like ""Spin the Black Circle"" and ""Whipping"" are more fresh and lively than anything in their previous work. ""Corduroy"" and ""Better Man"" are songs of epic proportions that add nice dynamics to the mix. All the other tracks add in some way or another, and add to create possibly the darkest, rockiest, and musically solid album they've yet to create (although No Code is more diverse and experimental and also quite excellent). A far better album than most people give them credit for."
5,Another favorite album of mine,"With this album and Yield, I have to name Pearl Jam as one of my favorite bands... and those are the only 2 albums I own of theirs sadly(I have to get them all one day). In other words I tend to be cautious about what CDs i buy, because I hate getting one that I don't like to listen to a lot. I find it rare that I can listen to an album over and over and fall in love deeper and deeper with the music. This album did it to me... great stuff. It's not flippant, foolish music... it's music with strength, search, beauty, art, and love.To give you a feel of my favorite albums: Alice in chains: Jar of Flies Tool: Aenema Depech Mode: Violator Metallica: Master of Puppets The Cranberries: all of 'em Soundtrack of The Crow Soundtrack of The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly."
4,"Not the best, but amazing none the less.","Vitalogy is a work of art. I really like it and i listen to it a lot, but pearl jam has done better. versus and no code were both better than vitalogy, but vitalogy is vital to the pearl jam collection because of a select few songs. those songs are not for you, nothingman, corduroy, better man, and spin the black circle. those songs, i feel, make vitalogy such a cool album. the songs that are just strange are fine, but skippable, like bugs, aye davanita and hey foxymophandle, and songs like tremor christ and satan's bed just dont show what pearl jam is capable of writing. so if you're a new pearl jam fan, wait until you buy ten and versus to get this one and buy no code last. no code is tied with versus for my favorite pearl jam album, but no code is when most stopped listening to pearl jam. strange. oh well. this one's a good buy so check it out and you wont be disappointed."
4,just heard it and its cool!,"i stayed away from pearl jam as long as i could but with nothing to listen to i decided to hear some of their stuff.the self titled 2006 album i didnt like.ten is very good but looses something towards the end.vs is pretty cool, some songs i didnt like too much.no code is ok i guess but i didnt like it.yield has some decent songs but overall not too good.guess i dont like vedders voice sometimes.this album has a great vibe. its almost like their white album or trippy album. all those throw away tracks are ok by me. so far this is the one i liked best."
4,Very Different to Previous Albums,"A good album thought some songs such as Foxy Mop Handle and Bugs are a bit strange. Howeever songs such as Not for You, Better Man and Nothing Man prove that pearl Jam can do the ballday tale song with good guitar as well. Spin the Black Circle is also good when you feel energetic."
3,"Good album, but . . .","This is a pretty good album, and I'm not even a Pearl Jam fan. However, it is far from perfect. It has many good songs, but at times it seems to be trying a little too hard to be some sort of an artistic masterpiece. Its good, but it could have been better. The best song is ""Corduroy""."
3,A Good Rock Record,"Vitalogy is one of the best rock albums to come out of the post-grunge era; even though in 1994 grunge was still sort of out there with fake-acts and with Soundgarden and Alice In Chains. But still that doesn't take away from the fact that 'Vitalogy' is a good; not great album. Songs off of this are catchy; and some flat out rock, but the overall mix of the albums songs seem to be weird. Take the hard fast rock song 'Spin The Black Circle' being followed by the gentle 'Not For You' and then followed that by 'Tremor Christ' and 'Nothingman'; the lineup of the album seems puzzling. But besides all that the songs off of this are good songs; and only a few of them: 'Betterman', 'Corduroy' , and 'Immortality' i would call great songs; but they are the only GREAT songs off of this album, every other one is decent, i guess. But all in all this is a good album; but not one of the best."
5,Supremely Underrated,"I believe this album is on of the most underrated albums of rock.From the linear notes to the songs themselves.If you just omit the final track of the album (I rate it a silver) every song is pure gold. I think every person should own this album. I feel that ""Corduroy"" is one of the greatest songs ever written. Pearl Jam, in my opinion, is the perfect example of a band."
3,"The Least ""Vital"" So Far","I'm a huge Pearl Jam fan - been following them since the beginning. So when Vitalogy came out, I was more than a little disappointed. While VS found the band exploring some new ground after the success of Ten, Vitalogy showed the true extent of the experimentation that was going on. I wasn't impressed.To be honest, I believe there are as many good songs and there are bad on Vitalogy. Nothingman clearly makes up for the pain inflicted upon the listener during Tremor Christ. Corduroy compensates for Spin The Black Circle. Last Exit and Immortality offer a reward for having stayed with the album through Pry, To and Bugs. And Betterman makes up for the tragedy that is Stupid Mop.So, while there have been better Pearl Jam albums both prior to and since Vitalogy, its worth a listen. If nothing else, it shows an interesting point in the development of the band. Lessons learned from failures are just as important as those learned from successes."
2,What a waste...,"Vitalogy alienated Pearl jam from the mainstream and most of thier original fans, including myself. They have been adrift ever since, trying desperately to avoid thier grunge roots. When a band has no purpose or direction it's time to stop. Pearl Jam havent showed any direction since Vs. On Vitalogy it seems like Pearl Jam began to make music just because they can. The album is very disjointed and the melodies sound repetitive and offkey. ""Betterman"" is the only memorable good song. 'Corduroy' could have been a classic if it had been performed with the energy of thier previous albums. I now look at Pearl Jam like a 20 something year old who wants to get serious with thier life but doesn't know what to do or where to go."
2,How time does change minds,"I remember when everybody I knew thought this album was a train wreck when it first came out. Really, the only decent song on this album is Better man, everything else is filler. This was a haphazardly produced album that has no tempo or feeling, but rather a compilation of songs to meet a production deadline. Apparently though time has softened opinions on this album, at least according to Amazon reviewers. So with this in mind, I removed Vitalogy from my cd case, dusted off the cover and placed the disk into the stereo. What I heard was exactly how I remembered it, mediocre material. Time definitely did not soften my opinion on this album! For all newcomers to Pearl Jam, stick with Ten, which has much more solid writing and production."
1,I couldn't get into it..,"Let me start off by saying I'm not here to bash this album. I am a fan of Ten and Verses, but this was one change from this band I didn't care for.To me their quality of music dropped pretty bad when they made this album. The high points to me were Nothing Man and Better Man. Corduroy had a moment but over all this album was more lyrically driven(which there is nothing wrong with because music is nothing more than expressing one's opinion). The quality of the music is way too simple coming off their last two albums.This is obviously an opinion from a fan who preferes the old Pearl Jam. Having said this, my opinion is that if you're a Pearl Jam fan period or a fan of their recent works, this would be the album to get because this is where the big change began. If you are a fan of the old, this album may not be for you."
1,A collection,"A collection of pointless bad songs. How they release this crap after Ten. Soundgarden and Nirvana and AIC are much better. Pearl Jam just try to sound like whatevers on the Radio that day, this band is just a lie and spit on their grunge roots which got them where they are. Im done supporting this suck anus band."
1,No Pearls In This Jam,Pearl Jam had the potential for being a great band but this album shows a band in a creative and moral crisis. Songs about a boy who wants to be spanked and supporting abortion on demand seem to indicate that a pro-choice ideology can easily result in dementia.
5,Great movie!,"This is a really great western! It plays on Region 2 players only [the U.S. is Region 1]. Fortunately, my computer plays all regions which is why I got it. I like Burt Lancaster and Bruce Davison, so for me this was a very enjoyable movie. Lets hope that Ulzana's Raid is eventually available to Region 1 users so they can watch it on the widescreen. Great movie! Five stars."
5,Very Nice!,"This was a great old movie. It's nice to have a new copy of it again. We've already watched, and enjoyed, it."
4,"Great Movie, Good Quality, Good Price","No complaints. I'm very satisfied. This was a good DVD of a great western starring one of the greatest actors, Burt Lancaster."
1,"very diappointed!! in poor shape, unviewable","Not able to view, jumpy, double imaged, black and white, not color. Hoping to return, very,very disappointed especially being a gift for my Dad, and this being one of his all time favorite movies. Shipped late, and inside email said that it was in European PAL format, what the heck is that??? If it is unviewable by U.S.A. normally functioning VCR of what use is it to anyone??? Unless I can return and receive another in excellent condition, I will not purchase another item from this seller!! Beware!"
3,An Aldritch/Lancaster classic but 1:33!!,"Lancaster's brilliantly understated portrayal of a war weary indian scout must rank as one of his best ever screen performances. 'Ulzana's Raid' is an unusual and insightful Western, it daringly tries to peel back the established stereotypical images of this genre giving us a more three dimensional take on the usual cast of Western characters, even the eponymous Ulzana is allowed a credible flesh and blood character instead of the more accepted cardboard cutout redskin. It's this willingness to train a fresh eye on the native American indians and their adversaries that sets 'Ulzana's Raid' apart from other, more run of the mill Westerns. The downside to this disc is it's presentation, I'm not sure in what aspect ratio 'Ulzana's Raid' was originally released but I'm pretty sure it wasn't 1:1.33 - what a shame a little gem like this couldn't have been given a fresh full-screen transfer to justify it's release on this exciting new format."
5,"quality of DVD, not a review of the movie","I contacted Amazon 4 times as to wheather a DVD-R would play on my new Blu-ray player or not. 2 said yes, 2 said no and none of them were very convincing. This is one of my top 5 westerns and I have bought several VHS's so I would be sure of always having a copy. These DVD-R's are, I think, very pricey. The Universal Vault series seemed a Godsend if it would play. I even contacted Universal and they said it would NOT play on my Blu-ray. Then I had a chance to pick one up on eBay for $9.99, so I decided to risk it. GOOD MOVE!!! The DVD-R plays perfectly on both my Blu-ray and an older player I had. The print is excellent, it is clear, sharp, even night scenes. It has NOT been edited, sound quality is excellent. This is a super western, Lancaster, Jorge Luke, Bruce Davison and Richard Jaeckel are at their best, Luke is simply wonderful. I recommend this DVD very highly."
3,"Widescreen was nice, but key movie scenes were edited..","I already had an older copy of this movie from Goodtimes Home Video, but that edition was full screen and had several key scenes edited - I suppose for television audiences of the 70's. When I saw this 'Universal Vault Series' edition, I hoped it would contain the 'whole movie'. However, the same scenes were edited (ie. two things I know should be there: much of the banter between the two officers before assigning Bruce Davison to lead the mission, and the unfortunate conclusion of the attack on the homesteader). I considered returning this copy; however, since it was widescreen, it was an improvement on my original copy. Obviously though, I love this movie or I wouldn't have bought it twice."
1,The disc: Ulzana's Raid,"I ordered the disc Ulzana's Raid and was looking forward to receiving it. When the disc arrived, I learned that it was for thewrong area, and would not play. I went back to my original purchase and could not find any disclaimer that the disc would not work for me. I was axtremely disappointed. To return the disc forcredit is not possible since they say I was warned in advance of my purchase that it might not work on my player. Quite frankly, I was screwed by Amazon."
4,Ulzana's Raid,"Fans of ""Valdez is Coming"" should defintitely enjoy it. The two movies were made in the same timeline and Burt Lancaster did a fine performance in each. In this story once again he plays a similar role as a tracker. This time tracking an Apache leaving a path of destruction. I highly recommend this movie, but I highly recommend you don't pay the outrageous sellers that should not be allowed by Amazon to sell for $75 to $339. Eventually this will be made available on DVD again for a reasonable price. If you have a multi-region player you definitely can find it cheaper. If you enjoyed this catch ""The Professionals"" and ""The Hallelujah Trail"".CA Luster"
2,Are you kidding me?,"My wife and I did not find this video erotic or seductive. The ""ideas"" they present are nothing more than thinly veiled soft core porn. We are not what you would consider adenturous people, and this video really didn't give us any great ideas or insight. We will not watch it again."
1,don't waste you time,"I wanted a lesson on how to be more sexually romantic and seductive for my boyfriend. This video plays more like a porn movie. Actors (if you can call them that) preform ""seductive"" moves that are really cheesey, and not acted very well. Don't waste your time or $$"
5,Awesome album!,This was one of the best albums I've ever listened to! It made it even better as I am a Metallica fan. Breadfan was on here as well as Am I Evil. Nice to hear the originals.
3,Eh,"Was not my best investment not something i would truly suggest, but it's simple and it does get the job done ;)"
3,Needs more gel,"I guess they work better than using nothing, but they don't make a significant difference. They need a thicker gel pad."
4,Replacement scale,"I previously owned this scale until I burned it on the stove. This is a great scale and I use it almost daily to weigh food. It measures oz, grams,etc. It also works great to weigh for postage. I really like this scale because you can put a plate or frying pan and still be able to see the display. My first scale had a really crisp display, this one is a little blurry depending on the angle you look. Compared to other scales I reviewed before purchasing, I am still very happy with this purchase."
5,Great condition!,"It was really cheap so I was concerned wether it would play or not, but it played well and had a nice case."
5,Better than the first one,"Young Guns 2 is one of those rare forgotten about sequels that was actually better and more fun than its predecessor. There isn't particularly much in the way of plot but a great cast make this one of the most fun Westerns I've ever seen. Kiefer Sutherland, Emilio Estevez and Lou Diamond Phillips are joined by Alan Ruck, Christian Slater and Baltazar Getty in a new gang facing up to the likes of William Peterson, Viggo Mortenson and James Coburn. The characters are surprisingly well rounded and they find themselves in some amusing situations (eg a bat poo town!). Great fun."
3,Didn't have a choice,"I would have preferred to watch the first in the series, but it wasn't available. Without a little context, this movie was not as interesting as I imagine it could have been."
3,not as good as the first,It would have been better - if we knew that this was going to be a trilogybut one could only hope.
4,It's fun,"I love this movie. It is fun! Emilio Estevez as Billy dances around and clicks his heels. He is great. From my research project in high school American History sparked by the Young Guns movies, the friendship and conflict between Billy and Pat Garrett is accurately portrayed. It's sad to watch Billy's friends get picked off one by one.You really need to see the first Young Guns to understand the intricacies of the struggle between the regulators and the law. Is Brushy Bill really Billy?? Bon Jovi's Blaze of Glory encapsulates the Young Guns story. I recommend both of the Young Guns for your collection-especially if you're interested in the Wild West."
2,Stick to Young Guns 1,I found this movie boring and not near as intertaining as the first one. If you can whatch it for free It might be worth that much.
5,Young Guns II: Truly In The Blaze Of Glory,"Emilio Estevez returns as the smart-mouthed yet fast-drawing William H. Bonny, now much better known as Billy the Kid. Billy, one of three survivors of the shootout in the climax of the original Young Guns film. To start off the movie, Billy rescues his friends, Doc Shurlock (Kiefer Sutherland) and Chavez (Lou Diamond Phillips) from a miserable western town. But as the trio attempts to gallop on horseback all the way back to Old Mexico, a federal posse led by none other than the traitor Pat Garrett (William Petersen) is in hot pursuit, and the stakes are high as Billy battles his way through a ton of barriers... ultimately ending in a mysterious ending: did Billy the Kid survive?"
3,Cant really complain,"The DVD arrived fast and in good condition, except someone had written on the front of it with marker. Not a huge deal because it works fine, but it would have been nice not to have someone else's names written on my DVD."
3,Fun Film,"This is just an entertaining, put your mind in neutral, and enjoy the Jon Bon Jovi soundtrack movie. I enjoyed the first movie a great deal and felt the laughs, action, and setting was quite fun. The second installment is also a decent addition and fills the entertainment purpose."
5,Youngs Guns II Review,"This movie is about Billy the Kid and his gang, and they are trying to get away from Pat Garrett and get to Mexico. It's a great movie, lots of shoot-em-up, and all the cast from the first one is back. It's lots of action, and moving around, never a dull moment, from start to finish. Great movie, lots of fun."
5,Great Movie about Billy the Kid,"If you're looking for a good gunslinger movie about some American History, this is a great choice. I've always thought it was a great movie, the dvd includes some good special features such as some history on the characters. I'd suggest buying the first Young Guns as well."
4,good movie!!!,"I like the movie, it has its slow moments just like any other movie but good, the actors on the movie are some of the best,!! overall good!!"
5,Two thumbs up !,"It's not often that sequels manage to emulate the success of the original (let alone surpass it). I can think of only two offhand, one of which is this movie (the other one being ALIENS).What can I say? I loved this film when it first came out, and after seeing the DVD my overall ""admiration"" didn't change. This is a more serious and tragic tale and the characters are much better developed (particularly William H. Bonny) vis-a-vis Young Guns 1, ergo more ""realistic"". The entire premise of the film, that Billy the Kid might have survived to a ripe old age rather than having been shot by Pat Garrett is though-provoking indeed. Great score by Bon Jovi along with add-ons such as the featurette makes this disc an essential!"
5,This is the best movie in the world,This is the best western film ever. Emilo rocks as Billy the Kid. This film is as good if not better that Young Guns 1. I just hope it comes out on DVD soon.
4,"Okay, so it isn't really History....","But this is still a most enjoyable movie. The chemistry between the characters/actors is evident, and there are lines I find myself repeating often and laughing. I found the Arkansas Dave (Christian Slater) character annoying at times, as he just didn't seem ever to understand he WASN'T the leader of the gang. Doc (Keifer Sutherland) was by far the best actor of the bunch, along with Garrett (William Petersen) which is probably why these two have successful series currently on TV, and the others don't. Lou Diamond Phillips was also very good as Chavez.If you like Westerns, check this one out. You do NOT have to see Young Guns I to enjoy it (I haven't seen YG1, and probably won't). I caught part of this on TV one night, and that was what decided me to buy a copy.The music is excellent, there is action and drama and humor, great scenery, and enough ""eye candy"" in the actors to interest almost anyone. Give it a try!"
5,Great product!,"This CD Belt Pack is EXACTLY what I was looking for! (I couldn't find it in any stores!) The price was right, and it arrived very quickly after I placed my order. Also, I was surprised to open the box and find a black belt pack (vs. the teal blue) and that was a bonus! Thank you very much!"
2,No results,I did not see that this product did anything at all for me. I was not impressed in any way.
3,I didn't carefully read the ingredients,and purchased a product with animal based gelatin. I haven't used the product but have used kudzu for years for medicinal purposes and as an alternative to other root starches. I also would not know how to use the capsules. This root is a mainstay of Eastern medicine and has to be used intelligently.
1,Nothing...,"Don't notice anything! I read about all the stuff it's suppose to do, but like a lot of those supplements they don't do anything- or if they do you can't notice. Maybe I'm a lot better looking now, than before and I don't even notice."
2,Don't waste your $5.00,"This software seems like something a student that is working on software programming would create. Very boring and I hate I wasted $5.00 on it. Very generic and too basic especially for children today, they need attention getters and excitement, this software definitely doesn't provide that."
3,"Dark, looming and NOT funny. This is a comedy?","I rented this film only due to Sting's presence. I therefore enjoyed his scenes, but had difficulties staying with the story. Maybe it's a cultural thing & I'm too much the ""Yank""... Anyway, Sting is a beautiful man. Great opportunity to see ""Most"" of him."
1,"Obviously, Women Will Watch This for Sting's Nude Scenes.","Viewed: 12/10Rate: 212/10: I was hoping for a nice mystery murder flick from Grave Indiscretion. Instead, my thought, after watching it, was simply...grave indiscretion. I gave up after a half hour because I was bored to tears. I came back to the film after a week break and ended up being tortured to the end, trying to finish it. While I like the English aspect, the movie is just simply not good. The plot was pointless, the premises were brain-dead, and I couldn't even care a farthing what happens during the film. When Grave Indiscretion ended, it ended just like that. However, I didn't think Sting was that bad, and he could do better films than this junk. All in all, Grave Indiscretion is a mess of a film."
1,Blaaah!,"This must be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I actually resented the time I lost forever watching and waiting for something to happen that would instill meaning to this film. It never happened.Just a long, drawn-out film about selfish and mean-spirited people you can't care about - even when they are murdered. Blaaah!"
3,Loving Sex,"The sellers were very efficient with sending my order. It came in only a few days, which i was very happy with. Although the movies were ok, they were not what i was looking for."
5,What a differance,Love the Empower. When I got married 4 yrs ago we bought a eurika. We thought it worked well till it died and we replaced it with this machine. What we thought were clean carpets were so dirty. The old upright was only picking up the surface dirt because we used this 4 times the night we got it and for several days consecutivly after because it just kept picking up dust and fine sand from the carpet. After the second canaster filled with just dust the first night we started empty it into a bag and measure it. We took 8 cups of dust out of 3 rooms and a flight of stairs inless then a week before the canaster was not filling with dust every time we used it. We vaccumed 2 times a week every week for 4 years with the other machine and the carpets looked clean but after we got the empower we were amazed at how dirty they were.
2,Could be MUCH better.,"I was not impressed with all the switches that reduce the power of the vacuum. These ""hush"" switches make the vacuum more quiet because they are reducing the suction power! Any switch that makes the vacuum perform worse seems rediculous. Hush and power switches are just a gimmick.The wheels on this vacuum are very poor quality. Even on a hard floor the vacuum is very heavy and difficult to push. If the wheels were made with bearings the vacuum would push twice as easily. Instead Hoover used the cheapest plastic wheels that have no bearings. The two plastic surfaces just rub against each other.Vacuuming is difficult enough without having to push harder than you should have to. Want a fast backache? Push a Hoover upright for an hour.Poor design.Also, cleaning is a time consuming dirty job. I found that using a tooth brush to clean the hepa filter is much more effective than the manufacturer's directions to tap it on the side of a can."
1,Disposable vacuum,"This vacuum is dead after 7 weeks of use.I could tell it was not well made as soon as I recieved it, but to only last 7 weeks is sad. Amazon has a return policy of 30 days so watch out. I am shocked at how poor the quality is for a Hoover."
4,Good but not IN DEPTH,"I love the blues, and as a saxophone player I was happy to get this book. What the book has is transcriptios of about 15 solos in styles ranging from the roughest Chicago blues to Sonny Rollins sophisticated chord changes.There is a CD where the author plays those solos accompanied by his band.before every solo there is one page, half of which is a short history of the stylist whose solo is transcribed, and half which is a theoretical reference.The solos are good to learn, and may provide a good exercise for playing blues. But the theoretical explanation is lacking and is certainly not IN DEPTH.I do recommand the book as it has some good blues ideas, and shows respect for some of the underrated blues stylists."
3,Accessible book but out of date,"This book's strength is that it covers many important topics in an accessible fashion. However, the 2004 copyright date is very misleading. Many parts of the text, examples, and references were current as of 1980, i.e., before the birth of most students who are using the book! The many precise dollar amounts of costs and benefits rarely indicate whether the reference is to, say, 1975 dollars or 1992 dollars. Throughout the book are phrases like ""recently"" and ""now"" that actually refer to developments decades ago.The author is a respected scholar in the field. In my view he should be embarrassed to supply a ""new"" edition as hopelessly dated as this one. Readers can save money by buying a used copy of an older edition--they won't be missing much."
2,Boring,"I bought it for school, and it was better than listening to my teacher, but it doesn't tell you what pages key words are found on and some of the information is very spaced out and hard to follow"
1,Not good!,"The light is not bright and impressive. It goes off not according to the instructions when just touching any metal object, but ONLY! when wrapped completely in the metal foil, which is noisy and hard to hide. Failure!"
3,Follow directions!,"If you don't follow the directions, it may shatter, as in the case of my husband that left it on too long and it shattered...."
2,Barely works,"This item barley works, very dim. Also you need some kind of wire or aluminum foil in hand to make it work. Not like what we used to have at all for our Uncle Fester costume."
3,A Lot of trouble,"This is not ""PRESTO"" and you operate it effectively. It is not SIMPLE, and requires some enginuity to operate as an illusion. If you have never had one of these bulbs before, you can not just get it out of the box and present a trick or effect. Practice is required. It requires two elements, the bulb and some metal. You must incorperate some form of metal into your act. It must be a single piece of METAL that must come into contact with both the metal side and the metal bottom part of the bulb at the same time. No metal apparatus was included with the purchase of the bulb, you are left to your own devices. I am currently using a strip of aluminum fold. I would love some ideas as to how to present the ""illusion"" more effectively, other than putting foil and the bulb in your mouth. And as for the bulb....The bulb will light, and is moderately bright. Let us say that children are amused....but adults may not be as impressed with its brightness."
1,waste of money,"Having read the previous reviews, I knew I was taking a chance when ordering this. It was a losing gamble. The light bulb lit up very dimly for about a half second, never to light again. I tried all of the things listed in the reviews - tinfoil, metal on base and side, same piece of metal on both sides, on side and base, etc. No go. Buyer be warned."
2,historical document,"that is a document of three legends of the jazz guitar but this should have been recorded at least 10 years before it was done, while they were still able to play decently."
1,A Mistake to Buy,"I am a medical doctor who oversees a flow cytometry clinical laboratory. I have always heard about Shapiro's flow cytometry textbook but had never reviewed it. After having done so, I can in all good consciousness say that this is one of the most poorly written books and one of the least organized. As a result, the few useful pieces of information in it are hard to find and certainly almost impossible to follow through because of his erratic style and thought flow process. My advice to anyone looking to get a basic flow cytometry book is to look elsewhere and do not make a mistake and buy this book."
3,very thorough but not very practical,"overall this is a good text if you want to learn the theory behind Flow Cytometry. This book was recommended by my cytometry instructor. However I have found other online material to be more effective for understanding, applying and analyzing flow cytometry."
4,Mr Peabody's review,"Mr. Peabody's apples is a book about a man who is suspected for stealing apples. A child sees him walking by a stand and just pick up an apple without paying for it twice. He tells the whole town that Mr. Peabody is a thief. Should he have told the whole town right away?This book is good because it tells you, that you should always get the whole story. For this the boy who called Mr. Peabody a thief finds out what he has done after it is all explained and done. It is a good theme and well written."
5,A Beautifully Written Story,"This is one of my all-time favorite children's books. Eve Bunting does an excellent job of narrating a difficult subject through the voice of a child. The illustrations add to the beauty of the writing. Although it is written for a younger audience, it can be read to a group of older students with the same effects. While I don't think that this book will make activists out of children, it will raise awareness of peers who may be in similar situations (especially among urban/rural populations). This is a great addtion to Bunting's wonderful repretoire of stories."
3,It will make you think about homeless people's feelings.,My name is Sydney and I am seven. I think that the story was a little disturbing and a little good. I like the ending because he talks about the bird. I think its a little interesting but not that much. I think it was neat that the little boy lived in airport and he bathed in a public bathroom. It made me feel a little sad because the boy was homeless.
4,Powerful Message,"This book carries a very powerful message about homelessness. The bird found in the airport, wanting to be free, is a wonderful use of symbolism. Homelessness is a reality in America and this book is a good introduction to that reality for children. Most children do not even realize that this type of counterculture even exists. There is an overwhelming theme of hope, and strength. The illustrations are done in mute watercolor and occur on every page."
5,Better then a sleeping pill,I have speakers in my pillow. I turn on my mini stereo and listen to one of the CD's. Before I know it I'm sound asleep but the next morning I put the CD in my portable CD player listen to what I missed as I do my work around the house. 6 stars!
3,"The early work of a master, clearly not on par with his best","It's so unfair to an author that their early work has to be compared to their later--much more eloquent--work, but I guess that's life. This collection pales in comparison to Kings work in the 21st Century, but it is indicative of his work in the 70's and early 80's. Today King's short stories and novels have exhaustive endings, even sometimes including epigraphs. But these stories end abruptly with the kinds of cliff hangers many readers hate. There are truly some real nuggets of inspiration here, and for the King fan this is definitely a must-read if only to experience the early development of a master. But like anyone working on their craft, there are some real clunkers in this batch of stories. Not even remotely on par with Just After Sunset, Full Dark No Stars, or even Everything's Eventual, but still King nevertheless."
4,stephen king on wheels,"This product is great. Used it on a roadtrip to Florida. John Glover is Smallville's, Lex Luther's Father. Good reader. After the first few stories he gets into the stories more and they add background sounds into a few of them. I like that. It adds to the story. I recommend this product."
4,Maybe a little dated in the telling,"I love Stephen King and find no fault with the narration by John Glover. Having said that, I found the set of short stories to be a little dated in 2008. Most of these SK shorts were early work in his career and while well crafted, a couple seemed a little predictable or dragged on. There are however a few I thought outstanding such as Quitters Inc, The Ledge, and Sometimes They Come Back. All in all a good listen for both a long and short commute."
4,Almost excellent!,"I really like this selection. John Glover does an excellent job putting voice to some marvelous King stories. My only complaint with the CD collection is that a number of stories are divided over multiple CDs.For a short story collection, I would have hoped the items were a little less cut up. But this is a minor complaint, and I find the set worth theinvestment in spite of the choppiness."
4,"Helpful, but no real-life examples.","Simplified DBR, presented in this book, is suprisingly common-sense idea which I'm going to implement soon in company I work for at the moment. Will it work?That is what I missed the most in this book - no real-life examples from real-life companies. Another cons' is... simulator which seems to be a substitute of examples of implementations. Furthermore mixing text with explanation of simulator game makes you to skip, but at the same time you don't want to miss anything important. Iritating!"
1,Missed the point,"Sorry guys.....but this is a very POORLY written book. It has a tendency to bounce all over the place and leaves the reader wondering what point are they trying to make? It also discusses neanderthal technology. Haven't these guys heard of the ""Three Step Method"", or ""Control Point Theory"". I think if I were wanting information about how to ""Manufacture at Warp Speed"" I would think they should at least know how to get to warp speed. This books doesn't have the answers.......it missed the point."
3,"Too young, to trust in it.","This is a story about a wealthy young leukemia patient, Victor's (Campbell Scott) final stage of its cancer condition the help of his surrogate nurse Hillary (Julia Roberts).Victor intents to quit its cancer treatment in a desperate will of being strong and living life the best as he can. He falls in love with Hillary and after all he recognizes that she can compensates all his misadventures, and fulfill his hopes of the last days he can live. Oh, the sexual live of a cancer treatment patient is limited, so, don't get too optimistic about this relation. Nevertheless, sex is not all for them, as we can expect it."
3,"Painful to Watch, Because of Content","I had a real hard-time viewing this film. It is hard to watch a movie about someone going through chemotherapy. That is why I rated the movie low. If it doesn't bother you, you may give the movie a higher rating.I also was not convinced by Julia Roberts performance and saw no reason for her to gradually fall in love with the gentleman that is going through the ordeal. He seemed to be very obnoxious the whole time!If you want to see a really moving story with Julia Roberts about death, I highly recommend the movie Flatliners. Roberts gave a much better performance in that one."
5,Dying Young,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It is one to watch over and over again. If you are in the mood to laugh and cry at the same time, this is the movie for you."
3,"too much vitamins, dear nurse","This film is good and sensible, without false sentimentalism, but contains a failure.This is the nurse played by Julia Roberts isn't very professional, so, she decides to throw the usual food of Scott, his rich but unfortunate patient, and replace it by fresh vegetables plenty of vitamins.The problem is these diet is poison and a fuel for leukaemia, as these is also a malign, but at last, a living entity that grows stronger if you feed it."
1,Cornball Drama at its worst,"This is one of those movies that guys will loathe and their wives or girlfriends will love. Well, being of the male persuasion, I thought this was one of the corniest movies ever. I'm always up to see a good tear-jerker, but here you're too busy figuring out the terribly predictable plot to get wrapped up in the GENEROUS amount of tears you'll see."
2,Disappointed,The plot of the story was ruined by the immorality and language. This could have been a beautiful story if sexual immorality and profane language had been eliminated. It is possible to have something beautiful and clean where when you finish you feel that you have experienced something encouraging and uplifting. Dying Young and the plot of sickness and someone caring is beautiful. Falling in love is beautiful but it is degraded by stooping to immorality. I threw it in the trash as I would not share it with those that I love.
5,Amazing,"The first time i ever saw this film, i came across it flipping through channels. I can honestly say that no words put together can possibly describe the sheer beauty that is this movie. No matter how much i try, i can not hold back the tears. It's an absolute classic."
3,finding the graves at the center of the maze,"A strange way to find love for a pretty girl:signing on as a nurse for a cancer patientwithout knowing what she is getting into.Hair falling out and vomiting along with extremes in painmake it a very hard experience, but he runs away with herto the sea coast in northern California.A love story that we don't see the end of."
3,My heart go out to HER.... AWE!,"I am glad she was courage enough to be with him till the end. She thought he was well that his hair grew back but he actually ended chemo , went to out town for her. So that she could see what he was like with his hair. It aww... yet sometimes ppl gotta something you don't like . Still it is a love that keep you alive"
3,good read,"Have never read this authors work before, and I enjoyed the book, kept my interest, with good plot twists. It is sort of like a Clancy book. I am going to get more of this authors work."
5,This story held my attention to the end,"I couldn't put it down - enjoy political intrigue, and it exceeded my expectations. I recommend it to every one"
4,The Other President,I enjoyed the book from cover to cover. Came across by accident but was really good. I got the titlefrom one of Amazons emails.
3,First novel?,"The book started very well--it was easy to read and fast paced. However, it seems that this might have been the author's first novel; there were sooooo many events happening to the main character. In every situation, there was right off the bat, an ally, followed quickly by an enemy. The different situations became tedious reading, so I jumped to the last few pages of the book. I really didn't miss a thing."
4,Ykpk Komment,"I thought that this book was well written and exciting. Unfortunately, it had one HUGE flaw. The author's obvious liberal leanings definitely distorts his credibility. When one considers the disasterous performance of this current administration, how can any sane person possibly believe that the Democrat party HAS ANY VIABILITY, BELIEVES IN THE SANCTITY OF THE CONSTITUTION, OR is consistent with the views of the majority of Americans? I personally found this author's views to be both disappointing and disturbing. If you are a patriotic conservative, go elsewhere."
4,Bionicle Board Game,"This is an excellent game. It lasts for a shorter time than the ""Quest for Makuta"" game but provides really good entertainment."
5,Sets the standard for its genre.,"The first time I heard this album, when it was released in 1971, I was mesmerized. At that time nobody was doing material like this, and it really knocked me for a loop. I must have played it 30 times, and each time it really took me to some strange places. Cohen is a genius with words, and there's still very little to compare with this album in terms of morbid/rage folk-rock. Nick Cave comes to mind, and some of Billy Idol's stuff, but Leonard is still the king of this particular hill, small though it may be.I wouldn't recommend this album to everyone. If you like happy, upbeat music, this ain't it. And it could be argued that some of the songs are misogynistic -- although I don't think they really are. But if raw, emotional poetry from the ""dark side"" appeals to you, this is a must-have."
5,The Masterpiece of the Master,"Leonard Cohen has no peer.The music will haunt you. One day you will be looking out a window thinking about the way your dreams have become tattered memories of hope and Leonard Cohen's simple guitar will be the soundtrack.And the cryptic symbology in his lyrics will shard glimpses of genius, madness, and God through your everyday world. If Cohen's poetry does not set your mind racing with curiosity, excitement, and despair then there is nothing to you."
4,Classic Cohen,"This is a moving selection of Cohen's work. His poetry and thought provocing lyrics set a mellow attitude. Passionate and witty, Cohen is truley unique in his gift called music. I will enjoy this for the rest of my years...Nick"
5,LC at his Best,"Not much to be said here. IF you like Leonard Cohen, you will like this a lot. I purchased it to replace a broken CD. Get his London Show DVD. It is phemominal."
5,Perhaps Mr Cohen's Best,"This was the first Leonard Cohen album I ever owned, his third overall, and, 33 years later, I still think its probably his best. A very comfortable blend of electric and acoustic instrumentation without the over production of his first album and a very good song selection. I guess only Joan of Arc would qualify as a ""greatest hit,"" but all the songs are strong and a nice live version of Sing Another Song Boys serves to break up the other studio material. I own all his stuff, and while probably one or two other deserve the five stars I gave this, Love and Hate is still the best.BTW- The songs are Leonard Cohen songs which means that on the whole they are rather depressing."
5,No words to describe...,"My favorite recording of anyone ever. It has changed my life. Thank you, Mr. Cohen. Buy it and be reborn."
5,Exceptional!!!,"Leonard Cohen is an atrist with a vast amount of talent. His style is unique to him, and that's why we love him. He expresses everything we are in beautiful words. He deserves the five stars I gave him!"
3,Sony Clie volatile memory,I purchased a Sony PEG S360 approximately two months ago. I chose this model because it was highly rated in comparative reviews of PDA's. A major drawback of this product is that ALL information on the memory card becomes lost if the battery completely loses a charge for an extended period of time. I learned this through personal experience but fortunately I had backed up my information on the computer. My old PalmPilot did not have this problem. I probably would not have bought the Clie if I knew that it was so easy to lose information.
1,broken lcd screen,I previously had a palm & gave ti t my Wife when I purchased the Sony. The first time that it fell off my desk and hit the ground it broke the screen (approximately 4 months old). Now try to find a replacement or warranty or have fixed? You might as well place in the trash bin!! To replace the screen is worth equal to cost of the unit! I will be going back to a Palm for my replacement.Frank
4,Enjoyable and Entertaining,Good entertaining movie for the whole family whether they enjoy baseball or not. I would definitely recommend it.
4,Good Fun,This is a silly baseball movie from the early 90's and I love it. Anytime an actor can pull off a sports movie by actually looking like he/she knows how to play the game it's always a good thing. The good news here is that Tom Selleck and Dennis Haysbert get the job done.
3,A good old Baseball Movie,"A fun and good way to start the ball season. It is good movie for kids and has a wonderful suprise ending. And, of course, its a great story that includes baseball!"
4,A great classic,This is a great Tom Selleck classic. Twists and turns from the beginning make this a funny and enjoyable movie.
4,Baseball Classic,"I love this movie, always have. It's not the best baseball movie but its one I've always enjoyed. If you like baseball it's a good one to add to your collection"
5,BASEBALL AND CULTURE,"This is another great baseball movie (I list it with the best), this time with Tom Selleck and some of the cultural differences and expectations between the Japanese and Americans. It has its hilarious moments, as well a love interest between Tom and the Japanese manager's daughter. The movie has been around awhile but is still timely and worth watching. I liked it... and of course, Tom is a wonderful actor and plays the role to the max. He'll always be Magnum PI."
4,Classic baseball film with a unique twist,I love this movie. It is one of my all-time favorite sports movies. It is funny without being vulgar. It also has a great message and a unique story.A must-see for any baseball movie fan.
4,AN EXCELLENT BASEBALL COMEDY,"Even though it was not a major hit, ""Mr. Baseball"" is one of the better baseball comedies, and, most assuredly, Tom Sellick's best film to date. It about baseball, but more about clashing cultures, and the movie is well acted and directed. Ken Takakura is especially fine as the Japanese team's manager. Dennis Haysbert is also excellent in his role as a journeyman American player. Much better than ""Bull Durham"", which has been wildly overrrated over time."
5,Excellent movie,"Tom Selleck does a wonderful job of portraying an egotistical ballplayer who is shipped off to Japan.He is ""reborn"" so to speak and discovers baseball all over again. Real nice story set in a wonderful country where Baseball rules.If you like baseball stories, this is a wonderful one to add to your collection."
3,Mr. Besuboru,"A predictable and prurient fish out of water baseball comedy that is redeemed by being genially and stylishly perceptive about culture clashes. I have been employed as a ""foreign expert"" in the Far East for nine years and I laughed as I recognized many of the problems and pitfalls that an American faces. Perhaps my favorite scene is when Jack tells his team, ""The opera ain't over until the fat lady sings."" The poor translator's efforts to explain are priceless. The story shows the growth of the lazy, proud American, although the growth doesn't seem to have any effect on his bed-hopping proclivities. Rated PG-13 for profanities, vulgarities, partial nudity and fornication. Look for a cameo appearance by major leaguer Derrek Lee's father, Leon Lee, who played professionally in Japan with his brother Leron. Leon served as a consultant on the film."
3,where is my movie?,the movie is ok.. you must enjoy baseball movies. The shipping.. (moviemars)takes about 10 business days... don't beleive the 3 to 5 business standard delivery
3,TOM SELLECK'S NICE AND HAIRY,"Tom Selleck would seem to a good choice to play the big, strapping major-league star who's sent to play baseball in Japan, land of short people. But while Selleck's physique works, his personality does not. The story is supposed to be about an arrogant ""jock"" who gradually learns the values of teamwork and humility while stuggling in a foreign environment, but Selleck comes across as such a nice guy, (even in the early scenes where he's meant to growl and snarl), that there's no real sense of transformation.However, the movie doesn't take itself too seriously amd Tom has several chances to take off his shirt and thus display that hairy chest of his. (If there were a Mount Rushmore for hairy chests, Tom's would be right up there along with Sam Elliott's, Clint Walker's, and Burt Reynolds'.)"
4,Solid Movie,"Mr. Baseball is a good movie, although a bit unusual. It's not really a comedy and it's not really a drama. Picture those two worlds joined together and you have Mr. Baseball. This is the story of an old ballplayer who is a few years past his prime and gets sent away to Japan to play baseball. What ensues is fish out of water comedy as Tom Selleck's character gets used to Japan and simultaneously a love interest develops providing the drama. This movie is along the lines of a For Love of The Game, but funnier and not quite as heartwarming."
1,Mr. Baseball? More Like Mr. Boring!,"Mr. Baseball starring Tom Selleck is one of the most boring and bland films I've ever had the displeasure of watching. The story is basically about an older baseball player (Selleck) who is getting stale and unfit to play for his American Baseball team. Because of this, his team trades him over seas to a Japanese baseball team. Most of the humor from this often humorless flick, comes from Selleck's goofiness in trying to understand and comprehend Japanese traditions and ways of life. Somewhere in there, they toss in a love story between Selleck and a young Japanese woman. I couldn't really recall because I was falling asleep due to boredom. As with most baseball movies of this kind, it follows a very simple formula of slapstick comedy and ridiculous acting. I doubt I could stand another sitting of this movie and it has little to no replay value whatsoever. Booooo!"
1,baseball at it's worst,"so that's what happened to selleck's career. this is a horrible movie with bad swings, bad acting and a trashy love story that pretty much demeans all women especially those that are japanese. do yourself a favor and don't waste your money or an hour and a half of your life watching this ""plotline"" unfold."
1,No escape,"This work's main thesis is an elegant restatement of the principle, widely adopted by Jews of all stripes, that the child of a Jewish mother is ineluctably Jewish. Judaism is again portrayed as a nationality, not a religion that one chooses. Jewish history is paramount; Jewish theology, nebulous. It doesn't matter if one is secular, atheistic, agnostic, a convert to Buddhism or Christianity or Shintoism: if one's mother was born to Jewish parents, her offspring is embraced by Jews and Gentiles alike as inescapably Jewish. The absence of male circumcision doesn't matter; only tribal identity does. So The Unity Principle smothers all those it can claim in the face of declining religiosity and observance. I find this very depressing."
1,Not good at all,"Expected symphony sound, and got this. Parts sound like high school band. Try to be ""tricky"" with intros that lead into each song that start you off with bad taste in your ""ear"""
1,Utterly forgettable rehash of well-known songs,"I bought this album hoping to hear orchestral Beatle music. What I got was elevator music, and not very good elevator music besides. The Beatles' songs have attracted any number of alternate arrangements in the past, but this one takes the cake for lack of quality."
4,How about some sweet knowledge coming your way?,"This book is fascinating. If you've ever had an interest in the way the body creates speech, on a physiological level, this book is for you. It's short and sweet, but chock full of cool information. You'll learn about the building blocks of speech (phonemes), how the body creates them, and the neurological processes involved in creating and decoding speech patterns. This book is seriously interesting if you're into highly technical reads.A word of warning: This is not a casual reader for most people. I bought it because a college class required it as the primary reading material. If you're not somewhat familiar with the way sound works, or are unable or unwilling to research sound using some outside sources, you may be frustrated with this book. But if you're willing to do the extra bit of work, this book is really, really cool."
4,I enjoyed the excellent character development.,"Although this was not my favorite novel by Alice Hoffman, it had the well-realized characters and description of place which always makes me unable to tear myself away from the stories and really care for the people in them. I did note one error in your synopsis which states that Natalie feels neglected by her husband and takes up with her patient. The character, Carter Sugarland, is her long time boyfriend, not husband, who will never make a commitment to Natalie. The synopsis makes it sound as though Natalie left her husband. This sort of review misrepresents the book and leads me to believe the writer of the synopsis did not read the book."
2,Worst book,"This is the worst book i've read by ALice hoffman.All her other novels were brilliant,but this was disappointing.The characters in the book are weird and they are not likeable.The story just doesn't seems real....."
1,Worst Alice Hoffman,"So, anyone who has read The Dovekeepers or The Story Sisters knows Alice Hoffman is an incredible author. At first I was reluctant to try her b/c she has so many books I thought it would be too syndicated and just follow a formula. But after reading The Story Sisters I realized how amazing Alice Hoffman is! Angel Landing, however, is painfully bad. Perhaps some people can relate to this very strange female main character, but I could not. I can't even remember the character's name, she's so forgettable. This book drags on and on and it was a sheer force of will to finish it. I should've given up. The premise is stupid, and the only good theme in the whole book is the ""disturbed aura"" surrounding her client/lover, but even that drags on and on to the point the character is basically unreachable. If you want a jumbled up mess of a book, buy it. Otherwise, try one of Hoffman's better known novels. Ultimately this book seemed scribbled down to fulfill a publishing quota."
1,REALLY BAD BUY,RADIO CANNOT LOG ONTO A STATION AND STAY WITH THE STATION. HORRIBLE PRODUCT.DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY! I SHOULD HAVE PAID ATTENTION TO PRIOR REVIEWS ON HOWBAD THE PRODUCT WAS.
1,Really?,"Product sounds decent for one speaker. After a few moments, the radio changes its station. It is a digital display with a dial tuner. Makes no sense, but I wold not think that the dial would change by itself. Very annoying."
5,Good Value,I was looking for something light weight and cheap for a glass shelf in the bathroom. This filled the bill perfectly and reception is outstanding. Sound quality was not a big issue - just something to listen to in the bathroom - Perfect! Also it was received in two days - Remarkable.
1,Horrible radio-Do not buy,"The antenna simply fell apart from normal use within two weeks and cannot be replaced. Even with the antenna, reception is lousy indoors. A total waste of money. Coby customer service lists Saturday hours 9AM-5PM EDT on its website and its telephone recording. I called on Saturday Aug. 25th at 2PM and they were closed. Lousy radio, lousy fly-by-night import company. Zero stars."
3,COBY CX39,"These looked like an ideal candidate for Christmas gifts as they are priced quite competitively. Purchased a total of 14, in two separate orders. When the first two units were received we were amazed at the fidelity of this very small radio - and still enjoy listening. The case composition and construction is what you would expect and is of decent quality - as is fit and finish. The manufacturer needs to put a little more work into the digital tuner which is not as accurate as might be expected - with most AM and FM stations being far off their frequencies. Tuner issues aside - this is an enjoyable radio, compact and very portable - and is very much at home in the venue of sporting events, picnic's, the beach and camping. Overall, we rate this as THUMBS UP and are comfortable in recommending it."
3,Display doesn't last,"I bought this radio in October, didn't open until Christmas as it was a gift. It's now February and the display has already faded and you can't see the radio stations or time unless you hold in upside down.Directions were no help."
1,It's not digital.,"Lesson learned. Just because the product is described as ""digital"" it doesn't mean you are receiving a digital signal. It's got terrible reception and is very flimsy."
3,Fine for what it is...,"You get what you pay for here...No... it does not have digital tuning, which means you can NOT store any pre-set stations.Yes... it has a digital display.There is a difference between those 2 features: Old-school manual tuning until it ""sounds"" like the staion is tuned in, and you are reading the station from the digital readout. Got it? Good.Ya, it works.My only complaint: As others have noted, the tuning ""drifts"" off of the station ever so slightly. You can be tuned in perfectly, and then over a short period of time it drifts off a bit; just enough to notice, not so much that its useless, but maybe enough to wish it DID have digital tuning.I had this in my bathroom, but decided this would work better to use while camping, etc when I'm not picky about sound and just want to listen to the radio. It takes 2 ""D"" batteries, so that will come in handy when I don't have AC power. This would also work great as an emergency radio!"
2,Needs better Quality Control,It's certainly a substantial radio for the money.FM reception is excellent.AM reception is marginal for a rural area.I ordered 3 radios. ( for family members )One didn't work right out of the box.Another developed a scratchy volume controlafter a few hours of use.
1,Garbage.,Even for a Coby this thing is horrible. You wont get clear signals of any station. The materials are cheap and the dial broke after 2 weeks. I gave it 1 star because you can't give it a zero.
1,Junk,"I own several small radios, including portable shortwaves. This is by far the most unuseable. With single conversion design and a low price I expected some things to be under par, but....the frequency readout was way off and selectivity was horrible. Regular AM stations were impossible to tune in accurately. There was significant 'bleed' between adjacent stations making it difficult to impossible to listen. I returned this unit."
1,Hate this radio - don't buy,"I bought this radio two months ago. Already the volume dial is not working. I paid $7 for shipping the first time, now I have to pay to ship it back to Coby and then pay another $6 to have them ship it back to me. All for an $8 radio.Very cheap material used, low quality."
2,Digital Tuning?,"It has a digital display for AM and FM radio, but the problem is the tuning itself is not digital. You spin a knob on the side to tune it... making this no easier to tune stations. Who knew they even made radios like this? I bought this so I could easily change the channels from AM to FM but it is not easy at all. In fact it is very difficult to get to the right frequency. Also, I could not get in an AM channel that I know other radios could in the same location. On the plus side, it was compact and cheap. You get what you pay for I guess."
1,Worst radio I've ever owned,"This radio has a dial-wheel so crude that it's hard to make it stop at the station you want -- and when you get there, it's often unable to separate that signal from others nearby on the dial. I've given it one-star just to be sure this is posted."
1,Not a good product,Looks good. Worked great for say 30 minutes. Then the tuner went out. I would not recommend this item for purchase.
3,Limited Usefulness,"I bought it used. I had intended to use it to listen to 570AM in the New York City area but 970AM seemed to drown it out. Instead I am using it on the FM dial and there it works well enough to keep since the cost was nominal. There may be a design defect, if not some kind of previously unnoticed or unreported damage"
4,Nice radio for the price,"It's a nice radio for the price. I bought it for our storm shelter, and it picks up all frequency ranges. The case is a little flimsy (plastic, of course), but for the price overall, it's a good deal."
3,digital tuning display -not digital tuning,"A much better buy is Sony ICF-S10MK2 Pocket AM/FM Radio, Silver. It is way smaller and gets better reception. I own both radios but only use my sony now for news and talk radio in the kitchen. Needs no plug in."
2,It is ok,"Doesn't get great reception, so we ended up not using it after all. Not a great value. I know it was cheap, but not worth the money."
1,"Colby CX39 World Band am/fm shortwave Radio, Silver","Husband told me to throw in the Trash, which I did......it was Made is China,...instructions said to wash hands after touching plug because of LEAD....Radio had poor reception....Instructions are poor as Radio would not respond to instructions....Seller would take care of situation; however, cost of shipping back not worth it.....Seller do not sell this radio...."
1,cheap plastic junk,"This radio sucks. The tuning band does not accurately read the position and will not lock in a station in FM. Antenna does little to improve tuning capability. It looks like a quality product,but it is a cheap piece of plastic junk."
1,Terrible product,"This is a terrible radio. I wanted it for work just to listen to some sports talk radio or music in the morning. Unfortunately, it basically does not pick up any AM stations. And the FM stations don't come in much better. The tuner is terrible too, as it is so sensitive you have trouble getting it to the station you want (if that station will even come in on it). All in all, i'm just warning you not to buy this radio."
1,Very Poor Quality,"I was simply looking for a small, plug-in AM/FM radio to replace a 30-year-old model that finally died, and since those are not in high demand these days, this Coby model seemed the best choice. I had read several negative reviews on Amazon.com, but I figured ""how can anyone screw up a simple AM/FM radio?"" So I bought it anyway. Unfortunately, the negative reviews were right! My radio had three flaws so fast that I returned it immediately (AM reception sucked, tuning frequency drifted by itself even when you didn't touch the unit, and there was an audible buzz/hum from the speaker even when the unit was turned off!) Amazon.com should stop carrying this model, because they are likely to get other dissatisfied customers."
3,Lace support broke on first use,"I got these, put them on, pulled the laces tight (once) one of the brass supports for the laces broke off immediately. Not the hooks, the main lace supports further toward the bottom. Other than that it felt comfortable for the next 15 seconds while I gazed confusedly at my broken pair of new shoes."
1,Great Idea made TOOOOOOO Small,Item has great features and would have worked well except that to wear it comfortably you cannot have a waist larger than 25 inches. The waist straps are not adjustable more than 1/2 inch on both sides and are not secure when adjusted to the maximum length.
2,Overcoming Prison and Addiction,"This book was not only expensive, but in my opinion poorly written. Although the writer overcame many obstacles in his life, he has a tendency to blame others for his own mistakes. This ""book"" was so short that I would call it a pamphlet."
5,Served its purpose.,I used this book for a college class and it was very helpful. When it came in the mail it was in perfect shape. I was also able to re-sell it later.
5,Very nice with the color photos,It is very good catalog but instead of supplying multiple images for a sigle vehicle from a certain year it could be better to have more photos of different models from the same year. Technical data could be more detailed.
5,best desserts on earth,"I have owned this book for many years. It contains the best recipes that food editors contributed. It is the one book you should own. I used to own a bakery, and I guarantee this book's high value."
3,Not editted very well,"I used the Que VB5 book along with the Exam Cram book and passed with an 80%. I think I bought the very first printed copy because I ordered it the first day it became available. It had many typos and in some cases directly contradicted what I read in the other book. The practice test was very good and turned out to be much more challenging than the actual test. If you pass the practice test you should have no trouble passing the actual test. I would say that for the money, this book was worth it."
1,STAY AWAY,I was going to use this book for cramming after I read the book by Que.This book had so many contradictory statements and a lot of errors. I couldn't believe what I was reading.I passed the test with no thanks to this book.
3,"Good book, but use many sources to prepare for 70-165","I read this book 3 times and then took the transcender practice exam. WHOA!! This book is missing some very important substance that the author seems to dismiss as trivial or ""unlikely to appear on the exam"". For instance, the first question on the Transcender exam had to do with implementing asynchronous processing. This book has next to no information on that topic, much less an in-depth look at all the concepts surrounding it (needless to say, I missed THAT question). That is just a sample of what I would term the 'shallowness' of the book. I do, however, think that the author does a good job detailing the topics that ARE included in the book. Bottom line: DEFINATELY buy and use the Transcender exam also before you waste $100."
4,Good Book,This was a great review guide to study for the exam. Couple this book with:- Using VB5- Reading the Books Online and Help File- Using the Exam Prep Outline from Microsoft- Transcender Test SimulationsBottom Line: It takes more than one book to pass the exam. But this book can boost your score.
4,"Not for learning VB, but Excellent test prep guide","This book is for passing the VB cert test, and it does a great job. Yeah, there are some stupid mistakes that should have been detected before publishing. However, these mistakes should be obvious to anyone ready to take the VB test. This information is well presented and the practice test, in my opinion, is more difficult than the actual cert test. I passed with a good score and this book helped make that possible."
2,Its called Proof Reading,"After finding some errors with the stated and actual behaviour of VB, on top of the typos and inconsistensies in the text and figures I quickly lost confidence in this book. I expected better of an Exam Guide."
3,"I passed the exam, but errors in the book drove me crazy!","As for all books in the Exam Cram and Exam Prep series, this book covers all information necessary to pass the exam thoroughly and at the right level of depth. Unfortunately, this book had errors on over 10% of the pages -- giving it a ""Dog-Ear Factor"" of POOR. Look for the recordset method ""MovePrior"" which should REALLY be ""MovePrevious"". I consider this type of technical error to be unacceptable -- particularly since it was repeated throughout the entire book! Many practice questions also had errors -- again, very disconcerting. Overall -- if you're planning on passing the exam, definitely get this book and read it through TWICE, but don't panic if you spot something wrong -- it probably is!"
3,"Good overview, but you'll need to study more than this book","The book hits on the keywords & concepts that appear on the exam and the book's sample questions give the reader an idea of the level of detail, trickery & trivia that Microsoft includes on the exam. However, there are several contradictory statements in the book that confused me so much, I had to consult another source. For example, pg 212, the book explains Active-X Exe as out-of-process and asynchronous. And Active-X DLL as in-process and synchronous. But in question #2 on page 234, the answer pairs an in-process server with asynchronous communication! I would recommend also using the transcenders and visiting braindump sites before heading to the exam."
1,DO NOT buy this book...,"This is a paraphrasing of the email I sent directly to Coriolis. Subject: VB5 Exam Cram is WRONG!!! Message: This is the WORST book I've ever seen in 25 years of being a programmer! Obviously just a rush-to-market attempt to capitalize on the current certification hype. Absolutely NO technical editing has been done on this book: in the first 100 pages alone, I have seen numerous typos, contradictions, and just flat misstatements of basic fact! This book appears to be just a chop-up of some other book. Code examples are wrong, they do not match illustrations, it references VB4 features that no longer apply to VB5, etc., etc., etc. How can you let junk like this out on the market?!?!? How can you mess with peoples careers like this?!?!?!? I don't have time for this kinda stuff! It's a good thing you say on your home page you are looking for knowledgeable technical reviewers to come work for you, because you darn sure need some! Dave Wald Carrollton, Texas"
2,Riddled with errors - look for a better book,The large number of obvious errors should lead readers to question and test everything in the book.
4,Tremendous Resource for VB 5.0 prgmrs. Lots of code samples,"This book lives up to its assertion that it is ""the perfect supplement to all certification study guides"". It never gets bogged down in jargon. Michael MacDonald explains thoroughly yet concisely each of the major concepts of VB 5.0 programming.There is no shying away from difficult concepts and no reverting to techno babble to explain them. The chapters are sensibly laid out; starting from VB datatypes, coding, collections and objects and then moving on from there.Also provided in the front is a Handy Cram Sheet - things you should know before taking the test. There are also lots of example exam questions. Watch out for those typos though. The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is that there are quite a few typos in code samples. Most are obvious to experienced programmers.Regardless of certification requirements this book should be part of any serious VB programmer's library. Forget Microsoft Press. Buy this one."
3,Good For Focus,"Don't try and pass the VB exam by reading this book alone. It will help focus you on the things you need to know, but it is CHOCK full of errors (and I mean beyaond the errata). Get the errata and correct your copy, then verify the stuff they tell you by testing it out as you go, and you'll do fine."
1,Music is excellent; avoid this download though,"This is not a review of the excellent music found on this album. Particularly, the Brahms' Double Concerto is an elegant interpretation.Instead, this is simply a warning that, as of this writing, the pieces on this album are all mislabeled with respect to the downloads, previews, and names. In other words, if you are looking to purchase a single work (or track), as I did, you will end up with the wrong download. Amazon have been notified about this problem but do not appear to have taken any action on it. Additionally, in the correct downloads of the Brahms' Double Concerto, both the first and third movements have a very disruptive, static-like high frequency sound that hurts the ears and is likely representative of a poor transfer from CD. I cannot confirm if the CD contains these artifacts. I can only recommend that you avoid this download until these problems are resolved by Sony and Amazon."
3,A sexual education guide disguised with a story.,"This DVD was dull. It could just come out and give you tips and guidelines for a healthy sex life, but the story gets in the way and makes things more dull than anything else."
3,An edited version of Beach Boys-An American Band,"This is a good video but it is worth the extra effort to search out the original version-Beach Boys, An American Band. This version leaves out Brian singing 'Surfs Up'as well as other key scenes. Best bet, get Beach Boys, Endless Harmony."
2,"Boy, is THIS Rare!","That's not a question. Used to be, in the days of LPs, there would be available hit songs from the past but if you weren't careful, you'd buy and find out they were not by the original artists but by Joe Banana and the Five Peels. The people who compiled this ripoff have a lot of nerve! One star each for Mark Dinning's ""All of This for Sally"" and The Amazing Rhythm Aces' contribution. Really!"
1,Not Happy,"DVD would not open on my new intel-Mac. Checked for updates on software, including Adobe, Quick Time, and Preview. Everything up-to-date."
3,A Good Thing?,Saint Etienne.They have had many UK hits with only 1 ever reaching the top 10 that was a track with Paul Van Dyk called Tell Me Why(the riddle) UK #7.Since this they have only just scraped into the top 40 and this their latest album gave them their lowest charting UK album #72.The first single side streets is a gentle easy going track and suits the style of the band but doesnt fit in with the music scene at the moment.its UK chart placing of #36 reflects this.The same can be said for the 2nd single Good Thing which only made UK #71 their lowest ever placing for a single and their smallest hit in years.The album is full of good little songs but if the band are to have any hope of becoming big again they need to start producing music that is typical of them from their 1990-1995 era.
5,"Marry me, Leonard!","What can i say, I love his music, lyrics and style! While I'm not an audiophile (do they still use this word?), I found the sound quality excellent."
4,Various Positions - good but I liked others better,Title says it all. Glad to have this in my collection - though it is 2nd tier compared to later works.
5,A great discovery,"I had always enjoyed the modern ""Hallelujah"", but had never listened to the original, sung by the writer. His other songs on this album are in the same vein, and were a wonderful discovery."
4,"""Hallelujah!""","Obviously Leonard Cohen has numerous great albums out there, however this is one of my favorites. I consider ""Various Positions"" to be part of my essential trilogy, along with ""I'm Your Man"" and ""The Future"". Truth be known, I almost skipped this review because I felt this album is beyond description. The music and lyrics are just absolutely amazing, and I feel bad for those who have yet to discover Leonard Cohen. This is one of few albums I can put on in my livingroom, and just stare out the window for 45 minutes. Listening to it is an event. His perfect songs ""Dance Me To The End Of Love"", ""Hallelujah"", and ""If It Be Your Will"" are all here, but I also love ""Law"", ""Coming Back To You"", and ""Hunter's Lullaby"". If looking for a collection, I suggest ""More Best Of"", or his 2-disc ""Essential Cohen""."
5,the best album ever written,"I've got every official albums written by Cohen, Dylan, Neil Young, Nick Drake among lots of others. But I just want to tell you if you're thinking about buying this album that in my opinion it's the best album of Cohen (though all the other are great too) and more it's the best album I've ever listened to in my life. Every track on this album is a big poetry and the music is exelllent. Leonard Cohen is probably the most underrated poet in the whole world because he's simply in my opinion the best. If it be your will, the law and Hallelujah are the closest to my heart today but tomorrow I might name Coming back to you or Night comes on. Please let me know if you can name me albums that are better than this. Birgir Mar Hannesson"
2,I didn't like it.,Too dull. Every song sounded the same. I doubt I'll be purchasing anymore Leonard Cohen CD's. The only song on the CD that had any merit was Hallelujah.
3,Good songs--not enough Jennifer,"Great songs on this album. It would have been enhanced had Jennifer Warnes sung more prominently. It is well known that Leonard Cohen's voice is uninteresting at best. Jennifer Warnes, however, is a wonderful interpreter of music as her later albums, ""Famous Blue Raincoat"" and ""The Hunter"" demonstrate so aptly. The promise of this album was in the collaboration with Ms. Warnes. It has too little of her great voice."
4,Hard-To-Believe Stories of Inside the Music Bix,"This book sure makes the record biz look crooked!! Chief culprits appear to be moguls like Charles Koppeman, who inflated the ""value"" of their companies before selling them at incredible profit and political-animal/corporate types who never gave a hang about the music, but only the bottom line. If all Bruce Haring writes is true, it's one heck of a cesspool filled with sharks - no wonder I don't get anywhere near the royalties to which I'm entitled!! This book chronicles a VERY sick industry! Makes putting out your own CD on your own label seem like the only sensible thing to do, if you don't want to get eaten alive!!"
5,awesome!!!! beats svanfob hands down,"I formerly had scanfob with serial magic software. What a nightmare! Socketdcan is dream. Just.plug.and play. No blue tooth to constantly lose connection and much faster. No battery to die like scanfobSocketscan beats scanfob.in every area an as long as ur device takes cf cards.I wish i had bought socketscan back in feb 2012 when i wasted.money on scanfob. Free at last, free at last from serial magic and bluetooth. It was a $330 lesson and one i will not soon forget"
3,"It's good, but...","This is a good album, really, it is, and yes, the band has grown into a new sound, but... well, I wouldn't be as disappointed if the ""new sound"" was anything really new. It's pop. That's it. The tap-dancing basslines and indescribable cleverness and glee of the first two albums have been traded for a game of ""follow-the-leader"" between the guitars and bass; the result is a very heavy emphasis on the very heavy beats over the hooks. Don't get me wrong, the disc has plenty of catchy tunes - ""Emergency! Emergency!"" and ""Happy Hour"" especially - and the beats are good, but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't hoping for something more. At least we've still got the live shows, right?"
3,"I hate to say it, but the negative ones are correct","Several songs on this CD are really good. Jersey shore and that deep south song come to mind. But the fact, as someone once told me, that you can sing the first song before it is even over is not a good sign. I have nothing against catchy things or pop or any of that. It's just that promise ring had a unique blend of pop and quirk that was really great on previous albums. A lot of people said nothing feels good was too poppy, but I thought that was perfect. Ultimately it was more catchy than this stuff. This is a big disappointment because boys and girls, their release right before this, was so good. The second song may be their best ever. If you get this cd and like it, please be sure(if you haven't already) to get the previous cds."
2,Promise Ring have done what they were intending all along.,"and I don't like it at all. True, they write some good pop songs but there are so many bands that write good pop songs. Promise Ring need to stand out in this crowed secne known as ""emo-pop"". They did that with 30 Degrees Everywhere. They did it with Nothing Feels Good. They don't do it with Very Emergency and that's a shame. They still have so much potential to make a record that blows everyone away.matt."
3,Not challenging enough,"My son enjoyed this game for about a week and then he had reached the highest level and was no longer interested in it. He is 11 years old. Now, he only uses it to trade with his friends. Its too bad the game isn't more challenging or doesn't include levels for older kids. Maybe it is best for very young kids."
1,Beware of Licensing issues,"Beware: The bulk of the almost $200 cost here is the license. The only way to access this license is by entering the ""Product License Code"" into the installation software during installation. Woe behold anyone who recieves a box with no sticker since there is absolutely no help either wih Amazon, the seller, the seller's FAQ center on the sellers website or anywhere else I can find. Without this little sticker with the Product License Code, what I have here is a very expensive paperweight. Extremely disappointing."
1,Really crappy software,"I purchased this item to save time entering business cards by hand, but never was able to get it to work. The software for this is very basic and I was not impressed. Immediately downloaded with glitches. I would not reccomend this item and will be looking for a different solution. I found this instead: [...]"
4,Did The Trick,"I get so many business card from various trade shows. This device was perfect for me. I was able to easily set up and begin scanning the cards and setting them up through Outlook. This product is worth the price. Do not buy a cheap one, you'll get what you pay for and this brand is sufficient and reliable."
3,An OK play but...,Although this is a perfectly adequate play for elementary schools to perform I was disappointed that it was so much shorter than the book and left out alot. The heavy use of a narrator to tell much of the story rather than the actors detracts from this adaptation.
4,James and the Giant Peach,"This was a great book full of adventure. James had a great life with his parents until they were eaten by a rhinoceros and he was forced to live with his two aunts. His aunts were very mean to him and he was not happy at all with them. One day he met a man who gave him a magic bag of beans. He dropped the bag on his way to his house. The beans caused the Peach Tree to grow very large. James' aunts charged people to come and see the giant peach. James found a hole in the peach and climbed in. Inside the peach James found giant bugs that would soon become his friends. James and the bugs left for an exciting journey inside of the peach.We thought this book was a great book that was very hard to put down. The whole book left us wondering what would happen next to James. It was full of adventure and would be great to use in the fourth grade for Language Arts, Math, Science, Social Studies, and Health."
4,An inviting way to compare literature,"Reading, James and the Giant Peach, as a story first created interest in the Play Copy of the story. Envisioning the interesting characters talking, interaction and setting was enlightening and enjoyable. My grandson, Parker was introduced to literature's written connection to drama."
4,An odd but interesting Book,Not the best but certainly one of Roald Dahl's better books it is an interesting and an addicting to read kind of book.it's certainly not and every day kind of book but is very enjoyable. I give it a 4 because of it's strange content.
4,"Very good source to start off with. Not the most exhaustive,","however... This book is good, because it is light, thin, and not too wordy. It covers many topics very briefly, just to start you off...It also lists many important phone numbers. However, it is not the most exhaustive source about the City. It is only good for general overview and brief reference."
1,What?,"I've been a huge fan of Another Bad Creation since the day I heard, ""At the playground"". They were dope with that motown philly meets sesame street groove. So I'm browsing the record store and see that they have a greatest hits collection, so I totally pick it up. I get home and pop it in and I nearly drop kicked my big wheel through the window, what was this junk? There was no ""At the playground"" and no ""Iesha"" instead it was this goofy sounding 80's music. Not just 80s music, bad 80s music. I was hearing songs like ""Be Near Me"" and ""Look of Love"". And the boys voices had really changed and gotten deeper. It was no Martika. I should've had a clue because instead of the boys on the cover it's some dude in a hoity toity bullfighting outfit. I guess the kids wanted to show they had grown up and changed musical direction, but don't put out a best of without any of your hit songs. I feel bamboozled."
5,"a,b.c.","what i could not have when attending high schoolis now myne . thank you for the cdrom.which i could not afford when in high school 82 thru 85 as a seller julie. the sale was smooth ? perfect it was.sincerly,michael ODell"
2,Totally a waste of time,"It is a total rip off.There is not much information about swinging,the performerswere porno actors and the acting is poor,no interviews of regular swingers,no information about countries and places where swinging is popular.I do not recomend it."
1,"Really, really bad! 1 star is too high for this stinker!","If ever an argument against swinging (or sex, for that matter) existed, this would be it. The main characters are just plain unattractive. The ""sex therapists"" lend credence to the adage that those who can't do teach. The photos on the cover have nothing to do with the video content--don't be misled--what you see is not what you get.The sex scenes are anti-erotic. I threw it away after watching...need I say more?"
4,Fun and challenging,I bought this book for my son who enjoys puzzles. He likes this book because it is challenging enough to keep his attention but not so difficult that he becomes frustrated.
2,toy bought as a christmas gift.,toy bought as a gift for christmas. item was sent in timely manner. thank you.
2,Great at first,"This replacement battery for my Dell laptop was great at first, but after 6 months the battery life is down to 30 minutes. The price is super cheap and it worked great for awhile, but now I will soon have to purchase another battery."
4,Careful what you buy.,"NOTE THAT THIS IS THE 90W. Now that doest make a difference if you running most Latitude models of Dells laptop as the power inverter and charging unit in the laptop support either 65W or 90W. Just make sure that your model can support either charger by checking dells replacement part page for chargers as it should list both if you laptop is compatible. Getting this adapter does not in any way shape or form, cause your laptop battery to go dead or kill your laptop. Only other thing that I think should be mentioned is that the charger is not from Dell, but considering they charge $20+ and shipping for a new one the sub $10 range for a no name replacement that will either work or not is a great deal. Just for reference I'm a computer science major and have refurbished numerous Dell laptops to sell on the side."
1,You get what you pay for.,It broke the next week after recieving so I bought another one and it broke the next week as well.
5,"Replacement AC Adapter for Dell PA-12, 5U092, F7970, PA-1650-05D",Good and cheap replacement to keep the laptop going. Shipped quick works great. Thanks :)Could not ask for better!!
4,It works,"This device works with my laptop, but it loosely fits. It is not a nice snug fit and therefore will fall out very easily.It does work though so I gave it 4 out of 5."
1,Durn thing was broke on arrival,The power light on the cord didn't light up green. I was disappointed to buy this second one as a backup. When I needed it the most on travel not only did it not work but it is to late to return it through the process on Amazon.com
2,Multiple problems within couple of months...,"The adapter seemed like a great value and I was delighted to find it at such a bargain price. When it arrived, it looked good and also worked well initially. After about a month however, the plastic casing on the cable that connects to the electric outlet started sliding somehow exposing and causing the wires to short. I had an extra cable so I changed it and it was back to work for another month. But recently the adapter has stopped working completely. There is no visual damage and I took it to a computer repair shop to check for any cable damage etc. but there was none. I have no recourse but to pitch it and perhaps buy a good original one from Dell."
4,Works well,This replacement adapter is bulky. But it works. Much better than the elegant looking original adapter which will not work if battery was fully drained.
4,written by his daughter,I read this years ago. Memorable. Details his struggles from trying to get newspaper and magazine stories published as young boy to trying to find a way to make a large piece of land in California a profitable farm.
4,Thrilling and Romantic,"I agree w/ the reviewer who thinks this novel deserves to be a film. The writing was rich, the plot was exciting, and the love story was romantic. This is one of the best time-travel novels I have read--fantastic, yet realistic. Very enjoyable."
1,What a waste of time!,This book was awful. My standards are pretty high after reading Diana Gabaldon's series. The characters were two-dimensional and I had a hard time even caring about what happened to them. The plot was predictable and boring. What a waste of time!!
5,Awesome,"Great product. Did as it said, once for 3 days, gave it to my dog with peanut butter. Had no problems with her not taking it and no problems with her once she had it in her. Will get again when needed."
1,Great routines--bad production technique,"These great routines--dance, boxing, and tai-chi--are rendered alsmost useless because the viewing shots alternate at random angles on random people instead of focusing on the instructors.By the way, the music is pretty good as well.What a waste of my money."
1,Hard and unstructured,"It was hard because the camera does a terrible job of focusing on the instructors. Instead, it goes all over the place and makes it hard to learn the moves. The ""free-style"" part was a joke: it was more of a competition to see who could out-do whom. Save your money."
2,Fun for a while.. AND VERY easy (moves are hard though),"I bought this video because I enjoyed the GRIND videos (also by MTV) so I decided to try this one. Well.. it can be fun for a while,but soon gets VERY boring!To me, this workout looks like maybe SPRING BREAK on MTV because there are alot of hunky-z dancing, and alot of freestyling, nothing like a structured exercise video.. maybe this is the point?The moves themselves are pretty tough, and I have had this tape for a while, and they don't ever seem to get any less tricky..it is hard to remember what comes next!I agree w/ Kelly at the end of the reviews, it is easy athletics wise. The Grind has more fun dancey videos like The Grind Dance Club Aerobics that are less tricky and more fun!Personally, I don't think this video is the best out there for dance style videos. However , I am strickly hardcore videos now (the FIRM , Cathe Friedrich etc) so maybe I am bias..."
2,fun but REALLY EASY!,"This is a fun video, but it gets boring very fast! For someone who just wants a fun video to do, this is good, but for high intensity aerobic exercise, no.. this doesn't really do much..Even if you TRY to up the intensity by performing the excercises with more energy, it still is easy... I think this is meant to be a fun video for people who want to learn to do a new dance sequence...!"
1,Don't waste your money,"We do many exercise videos and while we may not be the most advanced students, we are not beginners either and this video was a total rip.The moves are very difficult to figure out because the cameras are bouncing all over the place and won't stay still to let you see the moves or the angles are bad (it was very poorly filmed). It was more like a home video of someone leading a huge (100+) exercise class on a beach.Too bad, because maybe it was an ok workout, really hard to tell. I suppose if you watch the TV show a lot you might not be confused but it's not very professionally done."
3,You get what you pay for,"The microphone is decent, it works but isn't very sensitive. I mean, i wasn't expecting something amazing, so it does the job I guess."
1,Piece of garbage,"I ordered this, read the reviews and everyone seemed to love it, got it in, hooked it up to my computer, skype showed no sound, ok I thought, it can hear it maybe but its not loud. No. It didn't hear it at all, I had to pretty much put the mic in my mouth for it to even RECOGNIZE I was there. It's a piece of crap. Don't buy it unless you want disappointment, if it makes any difference I got the ATR1100, maybe I got the wrong mic, who knows =/"
3,"Good movie, bad DVD","This little gem of a movie is one of those rare movies for grownups. The characters are real, imperfect people, not cardboard cutouts.Unfortunately, the full-frame DVD doesn't do the movie justice. The sound is horrible, the picture is not especially good, and there are no extras whatsoever. Too bad. This movie deserves an audience, but this DVD will not help it get one."
2,Beautiful concept - inadequate writing,"This movie disappointed me. It's billed as a 'low key comedy', but ends up being so low key, you wonder (with the exception of a couple of scenes) where the comedy is. Most of my disappointment, however, stems from the script: aside from the chambermaid and her brother, I simply did not care what happened to the characters. The juxtaposition of the two ways of life was excellent - but it's too obvious where the scriptwriter's sympathies lie."
1,Intriguing title but lacks substance...,Both my roomate and I felt like we were watching a boring episode of a bad sitcome. Don't expect to find any story in the story. There is none!
4,Lloyd Parks translation is the best...,"The translation done by Lloyd C. Parks is the best, truly rendering the flavor of Stendhal's style into English. Amazon has it - just look for ISBN 0-451-51793-8. As a French major in grad school, I was studying ""The Red and the Black"" in one of my French Lit courses and the instructor happened to mention that a colleague in the English Dept. had done an excellent translation of it. I was curious enough to buy it and read it so I could judge for myself. I was so impressed that the very next semester I took a 19th Century Lit course taught in English by Dr. Parks. The course included Stendhal's book (nothing like picking a book apart in two languages!) - and yes, he did use his translation of the book! ;-)"
3,Reasonable Doubt,"While this book provided a valuable insight to the psychology and motives of the multiculturalist left, a good deal of its content was tied up in polemics. It gives a clear image of the effects and sources of the current attack on reality that has emerged from university philosophy departments and proceeds to infiltrate our legal system like a subtle swamp monster. For the reader who is not familiar with the origins of multiculturalism, it provides a sound history and family tree for the movement.Much of the book is involved in critiquing the ideas of racial and feminist activists and the implications multiculturalism has for American individualism. Particular attention is paid to its implications regarding racism towards minorities who have been successful in America, such as Asians and Jews. On the whole, a good criticism of a dangerous trend, but lacking in real cohesiveness and counterargument."
4,Beginning of the End,This gives old testament and new testament scriptures leading to the end times. Hagee Stresses the importance of the Jewish state of Israel and a new Jewish Temple in Jerusalem.
3,one mans view,John in this book seems a little far out there! He needs to not jump around so much so it is understandable.But good information for all to think about.God is a god of love so use this info to grow in gods love!
1,Terrible Doctrine - Shameful,"How can a ""spiritual"" teacher write like this and still ask to be taken seriously? This just shows again when pastors and teachers don't understand who the Biblical audience was in the first generation when these words were written, they will attempt to make pure fantasy up and claim it as inspired. Read the ""Last Days Madness"" by Gary DeMar and you will see the error of this type of hype and immature teaching. Hagee's book is just a shameful book, a complete misuse and twisting of scripture and I believe, brings zero glory to our Lord and Saviour, Jesus the Christ."
4,Good way to get wet...,"I set out to get a slip n slide for my 6 year old boy and 2 and a half year old girl. This fit the bill. I don't expect it to last many summers, but they are having fun with it now. you need to have level ground. I like the Spider Man sprayers (water sprays out of his hand like a web). I got what I paid for..."
3,Spiderman Slip N Slide,"The boys had a great time using the Slip N Slide but unfortunatley it didnt last long, they arent made the way they use to be :("
2,Poor production values,"The quality of the animation in this DVD is very poor - Think GI Joe & Transformers in the 80's. Very disappointing for something that supposedly had input from Shirow. The story is pretty standard, with the all the usual characters that tend to populate lower quality anime. The only thing Shirow here is the look of most of the female characters, but done in a hurried & budget sort of way. The landmates are a far cry from the ones seen in Intron Depot & other Shirow works. Save your money and go rent it first."
1,Dont buy this -Jult Warfell,I wasted money and time for a terrible anime. The animation was sub par and the story offered no interest what so ever. steer clear of this disaster -Jult Warfell
2,"movie, ""The Outcast""",I received the VHS video of the movie promptly and in good condition.However what I am really interested in would be a DVD version of that movie which would be playable in the United States. There are foreign versions available but not playable in the USA.
4,Interesting,"I found this book accessible and helpful, though it is ""heavy"" reading (understandably, given the topic)."
3,Well written book,"This book is well written and easy to read. It is a really great book and gives insights into various interesting methods to calculate rapidly. However, Mr.Flansburg and Ms. Hay seems to claim that these methods are either theirs, or Japanese. They fail to give proper reference. This preposterous misrepresentation is possibly due to their sheer ignorance or intentional need to hide the real source. In reality, these fast methods were invented during the Vedic Period in India around 400 B.C. One can refer to all these and more methods in ""Vedic Mathematics or Sixteen Simple Mathematical Formulae from the Vedas"", by Sri Bharati Krishna Tirthanji at Amazon.com. Nevertheless, the credit should be given to these authors for putting these concepts in a easy to understand format and encouraging kids to learn math...."
1,Shouldn't have wasted my time on this,"I have an earlier edition of this book and after revised version it doesn't look much different.The addition section and part of the multiplication section started off fun, but after this there are some typos and poor explanations that make it confusing. I tried emailing the author from his website twice and never got a response. Since he won't answer questions the only logical conclusion is that he doesn't stand by his product."
2,Not for Teaching Kids!!!,"This book is inadequate to explore the concepts that it puts forward, and the reader will not be able to use it effectively until they go through and fill in the wide gaps left by the author. The techniques within it are not universal to all numbers, and the author fails to mention this on numerous occasions. All in all, this book was designed to make money, while offering the illusion of ""cheating"" your way through math. Some methods within it are useful, while others only overcomplicate, and ultimately undermine, standard education techniques for mathematics, the standard way oftentimes being the more accurate, and quicker, way to do the examples within. Math is hard, sure, and that does make a lot of people hate it, but this book will make you hate it more, at least until you figure out what a scam it is."
1,Steer clear of this book,"While I truly admire the intent behind this book -- to help people of all ages to be more comfortable with numbers and basic mathematics -- I would caution people from using Scott Flansburg's book. I have noticed several errors in this book. In my opinion -- especially since it is relatively low-level math and geared toward kids or people that might be skittish of math to begin with -- the kinds of mistakes and errors in this book are totally inexcusable. There are other books out there, and depending on your needs (motivating kids, motivating adults, just wanting to learn rapid arithmetic or other math 'tricks'), readers should buy books other books offered on Amazon."
3,Could have been better,"I was excied to get this book. My mother read it 25 years ago and she said it scared her... I however was disapointed. I think the book would have been much better and easier to read if it just stuck to the story instead of going into the reasons why Joe killed... More information on the killings and less information on the mental illness. The guy was sick, don't get me wrong but 25% of the book could have been cut out and it would have been much better."
4,psychotic or personality disordered?,"I work in the mental health field and have just read this book. I was hoping that by the end of it I would be convinced that Joseph was either suffering from a psychosis or from a personality disorder, in particular antisocial personality, however I am still uncertain! My view is that he was suffering from a bit of both and this is why psychiatrists' found it so difficult to decide whether he was legally insane or not. It is definitely surprising that there was no apparent history of mental illness in his biological family. I recommend this book as enjoyable reading, however, if you are in the mental health profession you will find the terminology used outdated at times and ""attempts of suicide"" dramatized. I guess we'll never really understand whether Joseph was sick or simply evil."
2,First pair ripped,"I thought it was poor stitching at first, turned out it was the pig skin leather ripped on both hands. Now they can only be used as fueling gloves. Second pair was better."
3,a good product,be aware of the use of these gloves i dont think pig skin is as tough as leather but it feels a lot better on your hands i beef farm and have found that barb wire and timber cutting is a little tough on the gloves but they would make excellent driving gloves for the price i certainly cant complain
4,New York City's forgotten landscape,"The author makes a key point that every major city celebrates their waterfron while New York turns inward. Unlike London, Dublin, Rome and Stockholm, New Yorkers hide from their origins. The waterfront becomes the land dominated by commuter highways, rotting docks, and landfills. Despite the negatives, the history disclosed here is rich making the book enjoyable, worthwhile and offers the hope that some of these blighted areas may become future recreation."
2,Dribble.,"This book wasn't very helpful at all. Basically, it just repeated the fact that to learn how to be a producer, you need hands on experience. Aside from the lack of information, the book was poorly written. The sentence structure in MANY cases could have been corrected by a high school senior. What made reading this book even worse was the fact that the author failed to be funny whenever he attempted to make a humorous remark. Spend your money on another book! Here's this one summed up in a nutshell - go produce for yourself and learn by trial and error. THAT'S DEEP!"
1,May be helpful in the U.K. but useless in the U.S.,"Just like Spielberg dosen't need to know how a camera works. A record producer dosen't need to know how all the equipment works. However this book, which is written in how they do it in the U.K., takes the opposite tack and loads up with generally useless information. Overdubbing, multisequencing, split track editing, these are things a producer shouldn't be concerned with. This book gives you a crash course and more. It even told what types of recorders and microphones are best right down to the model numbers. If you plan on opening your own studio, then this book could be considered helpful. If your aspirations are more like Puff Daddy, Quincy Jones, Russell Simmons, or L.A. Reid, then save your money. Overall, this book was a waste of time and money and I immediately began checking into Amazon's return policy"
5,THE HANSON BROTHERS RULE !,"I own 1&2! I love these movies! I think everyone should whatch this movie. You""ll laugh to you die!"
5,Slapshot . . .,"If you like Hockey, you will like this movie. If you do not, do not buy it. The picture and Audio is 70s quality, but that is what makes the movie funny. If you like hockey fights, then this is deffinatly for you. Easily the best hockey flick ever, one of the best sport movies around"
5,Slap Shot lights the red light,"This is the mother of all hockey movies. And if the Hanson Brothers couldn't get you in the game then you're out of luck because this movie has put the game of hockey on the bad boys list. Paul Newan is a hockey player-coach for the Charlestown Chiefs trying to bring up their rapport with the locals. And when things got bloody, they bled face down on the ice for the finals. ""Slap Shot"" has inspired the bad nature for the game of hockey. Check it out."
4,TERRIFIC,I was SO happy to find this movie. it was received 2 days before the 'promised by' date. Would definitely do business with this vendor again
3,Doesn't stand test of time,I was disappointed in seeing this again. It doesn't rank with either Bull Durham or Breaking Away as a sports movie.
4,slap shot,The DVD was delivered very fast which was great since it was a Christmas gift for my son. He enjoyed the movie. I would order again from you. MCS
3,Slapshot,i relate to this movie. I played hockey and traveled with guys just like the ones in the movie. We alsoplayed teams with the resident animals and wackos. It was just like old time hockey.
5,Slap Shot is a classic,"I have always enjoyed the movie Slap Shot. The extras and commentary are interesting for fans of the movie.The stories behind the scenes while the film was being made were interesting.In particular, the Hanson brothers extras were quite amusing."
4,The best ice hockey movie ever,This movie is one of the all time classics. And if you are an ice hockey fan it's a must to see or even own this masterpiece. The storyline can sometimes feel a little long but the action scenes from the ice makes uo for it. I have personally seen this movie more times than I can remember and I'll keep watching it every chance I get. And I recommend it to all my best friends
5,A Great Hockey Film!,"One of the best hockey films of all time! Slap Shot has the best on ice action that I have ever seen. The screenplay can only be described as laugh out loud funny. Newman is superb as an older but still competative hockey player. His interaction with the younger guys on the team is sincerely heartfelt. Anyone can enjoy this film, hockey fan or not!"
4,On point for its time or our time. (1980'),"Why is this different than today professional wrestling? This one is real, that is fake. Although not an acadamy award performance, one that makes one think and feel, maybe better than the acadamy? A ""classic"" if anyone knows what that means. Watch it and then watch a professional hockey game on prime time and see if it does not ring true. Wear a pear of ""taped glasses"" to the next hockey game if you dare."""
5,This.... Is Hockey!,"I absolutely hate almost any kind of sport, but this is one of my top ten favorite movies of all time. Since I first saw it in the 80's, I find myself using many of the classic lines in everyday conversations. I heard it was actually broadcast on TV but censored, it would almost be a silent movie!This movie has so many classic lines I can't even begin to describe them. ""I go to da' penalty box... hang my head in shame..."" ""Dey convicted Oglethorpe.""And seeing the Hansen brothers, there is just nothing like them!Highly recommended."
5,Don't ever play Lady of Spain again,"This movie is a must-see for minor league hockey fans. I had seen it before and thought it was funny but when the UHL came to my town it brought on a whole new meaning. It's full of great one-liners (""so what's the story on that dog?"") and the Hanson brothers are hilarious (""listen to the f-in' song!""). I like Reg's scheme to 'goon it up', it makes for a good movie."
2,ugh!,Paul Newman was hopelessly miscast in this pic.It was unnerving to hear the filth that came from his mouth.He is too great for that.Hard to believe this is the same man who excelled as Fast Eddie Felson or Cool Hand Luke.
1,Slapshot Disappointment,"Being such a big hockey fan, I can't explain why I had never watched this movie. With 25 years of build up, I was really looking forward to it. Wow, was I disappointed. I didn't expect technically good hockey playing, I know it's a comedy, but to me it really wasn't funny either. Maybe 25 years ago, when I was in my twenties, I might have laughed."
2,Disappointed,"I've tried to find something very positive to say but cannot. I thought a Hill - Newman film couldn't miss but even as a comedy, this falls flat. The film ends up little more than a series of violent hockey games, even an attempt at 'old time hockey' at the end fails and team wins by beating up their opponents. Maybe the movie reflects the period of the mid-70s when it was produced."
1,Dissapointment,"I bought these movies because I once saw a trailer featuring the hansons and it seemed like a fun movie to watch. The original movie is really boring, there are only a couple of scenes worth watching. Slap Shot 2 is probably the worst movie I've ever seen... I'll never see a movie with Stephen Baldwin again."
4,All sports fans should see this movie... Newman at his best.,"One of the great sports movies of all times... The Natural, Major League, etc... The three brothers will will make you think of people you have played sports with during your trials in sports. Even the non-sports person will love this movie. It is just plain funny."
4,Everone has to see this movie,"This is a movie that everyone should see. It is not the best movie ever made or even close, but it has some of the biggest laughs of all time. The Hansons comming on the ice for the first time is the funniest moment of any movie ever in my opinion. I have never laughed harder in my life when the organist gets hit in the head with the hockey puck. The editing in this movie was pretty bad. There were a lot of parts that didn't need to be in the film. It was a little too long, I think it could have been cut a little better. This is not an amazing movie that deserves 5 stars because it does drag on in between the good scenes. If you like comedies and laughing at pure comedy though, you MUST see this movie. The Hanson brothers are characters unlike any you will see in any movie. You should see this movie just for them."
3,This set should be free.,"Full price for Slap Shot? No problem. Great movie. However, I'm not sure how much would be enough to make me sit through Slap Shot 2 again. $20? No. $50? No. $100? Maybe, but I better be gettin' free beer with it. And by the way, how is it that somebody gets stoned enough to say ""Let's put Stephen Baldwin in a movie."" I need some of that."
5,Slap Shot,"Classic movie. Even if you're not a hockey fan, you need to see this movie. Paul Newman at his best"
5,A blast from the past.,"I'd kind of forgotten how strong our humor used to be before Political Correctness robbed us of our Adulthood. Now we're all enslaved to the understanding of children and the handfull of idiots who are so easily ""offended"". How did we let ""them rob of of our cojones!"
1,A Horrible Movie,I am surprised Paul Newman was in such a horrible movie! He could have been a better. I've seen some excellent movies with Newman and I thought this would be excellent and very funny but I was dissapointed. The hockey games were funny but that was it.
1,Don't buy this for a child hockey fan!,"I bought this for my son who is a huge hockey fan. This movie is not for kids, and quite honestly not for Hockey fans either. Most of this movie is focused on a bunch of sex crazed vulgar, middle aged, wanna-be athletes. This is a terrible example of the sport of hockey. The use of violence as a way for this team to succeed is not the lesson I want my young athlete to learn. If you want your hockey player to see a movie that shows the spirit of fair play, teamwork and sportsmanship, buy the Mighty Ducks movies."
4,Classic sports comedy,"This is one of the classics. Who are these people giving this film 1 star? Are they too uptight to understand the humour. The story is great - anyone who has been invlolved in minor league hockey should enjoy this movie. I was invlolved in Roller Hockey for 3 seasons and this movie captures the mood and essence of minor league hockey players and their ""happy-go lucky"" spirit about the game of hockey and the game of life. The story within the story captures today's sports world. The team owners threats to move the team to Florida have become a reality in the 1990's."
4,Seems to be just the thing,I ordered three of these and so far so good. They go together very quickly with no J clips to fuss with and seem built well. The door access is not from the top but the front as pictured. I have them on an angle iron frame for support and placed one through the middle to support the floor a little more as I have 10# NZW rabbits and it would sag if I didn't hence the 4 stars. The price was good and the shipping was free and fast with prime. I'm happy and the rabbits are too!
5,Excellent book! A must read.,"Marty McMorrow is a leader in the field of behavior analysis, and a man who understands the complexities of treating individuals with behavioral challenges. This book explores some of the often overlooked aspects of working with people. I work with difficult behaviors everyday, and purchased this book to help me keep my perspective. The book is very well written, insightful, and inspiring. I keep it handy for times when I need to get fired up about what I do. Get this book, you'll be glad you did!"
4,back when...,"emo was basically just indie rock, the promise ring were a really fun band to be into. as far as i'm concerned, this was their high-water mark. i managed to see them live around the time horse latitudes came out and they were one of the more entertaining bands i've seen. i think they all dressed up as corey feldman..."
5,They way I like my pop!,"This is the Pop that makes you feel good inside and out... yes EMOtional, but pure pop feel good. Feel the pulse on the, ""pink chimmney's in main""... A big Oh YEAH!"
5,it's too good,"*wow* if only all pop music was made this good. i can't shift the thing from the turntable, i think someone glued it in there."
4,best promise ring cd...,This is the climax of the promise rings work. Good pop rock with excellent cd art.
2,I sort of get it...,"The Promise Ring are from my hometown of Milwaukee, Wisconsin. I really wanted to give this disc a higher rating for that reason alone! However, this disc does not quite cut it for me. I own it, but rarely listen to it. In order to enjoy it I have to be in just the right sort of mood; one that craves rather disjointed music that doesn't really rise and fall at all, but just is. This is not a bad album. This is not a great album. It just sort of is. The first track is decent, but it does not go anywhere. The rest are rather forgetable. They all kind of run together. I enjoy some emo, but as others have said, I don't really care too much for the lead vocalist. Again, he's not bad, he's not great. He just sort of exists and drones in the same manner on all tracks. I remain curious about ""30 degrees everywhere"". Perhaps that is a better disc. Hit and (mostly) miss. I might recommend checking out the little heard, now-defunct band BLOOMSDAY as an alternative to this album."
2,weak but easy to hum along to,"Heard a lot of good reviews of this record, but I think it's very weak compared to other records in the genre... try Jawbreaker's ""Unfun"" or SamIam's ""Soar"". Even Milwaukee's ALLigator Gun was better than this."
2,Not great at all,"This was just like a porno, I could not believe the people on the DVD were married or a couple for that matter. The men in the video sounded dumb, but if you are a woman you will find the men as eye candy and if you were in a relationship you would want the men to just shut up and get to business without saying a word ..lol..and if you are a man the women are above average- but the people that make these DVDs are not going to put unattracted couples in these, after all they want you to watch it; it is not worth the full price...get it used if you buy it."
4,4 stars instead of 5,"It's finally out. It's all I play in the truck. Why only 4, I don't want her to see a review with a 5, and get a swelled head and settle with her next CD. I want her to be as much fun on her next CD as she's been on all the others. She loves to sing, and I like listening. I want more of her CD's, and I want her to give 110%.Can't say more or it'll sound like I gave her 4 instead of 5 out of spite.Skylark"
5,Renee is unbelievably talented,"I bought this album after listening to only a couple of songs and absolutely love it. She is such a great talent and can sing a variety of songs from blues, jazz, ballads, show tunes, big band music, you name it. She is as good as some major celebrities and I'm wondering why someone isn't promoting her to the top. She could do it all. And a duo with Michael Buble would be outstanding."
2,I've been sucker-punched,"Renee, child, what were you thinking?Don't you have PEOPLE? Like others, I've been waiting for years for your follow-up, and those silly people ran ramshod over the making of this CD! Why did they suffocate you with this smarmy stuff, and the production is piss-poor...You and Mr. Foster put one on us with your epilogue cut, ""nothing but the blame"", by far the best selection. We got sucker-punched, and you, little pretty one with the captivating voice and monster potential, got robbed!"
1,disappointed,"Fiest two albums were far better than this one.Very disappointed after all the buildup.Both Renne and Foster could have done better.Love Renne, but this just didn't have it."
2,Disappointed,"DO NOT BUY THIS CD FOR SKYLARK OR LOVER MAN!! You will be disappointed as it sounds awful! I will stick with the original talents on the classics. The rest of the songs are mediocre, but the back ground music was nice."
2,skylark,"SKYKARK BY RENEE OLSTEAD,AFTER WAITING SO LONG, IS QUITE DISAPOINTING, UNLIKE HER SELF NAMED 2ND C/D,OF WHICH I AND MY FRIENDS LOVE, THIS ONE COMES ACROSS LIKE THE NEW JUNK, OUT THERE, WHERE YOU CAN ONLY UNDERSTAND SOME OF THE WORDS. MOST OF IT IS A BUNCH OF NOISE WITH LITTLE CLARITY!.I LIKE TO UNDERSTAND THE WORDS AND NOT LISTEN TO A MESH OF VOCAL AND BAND! IF SHE MAKES ANOTHER ONE, I'LL LISTEN TO IT FIRST BEFORE I DECIDE TO BUY SO I DON'T GET STUCK WITH IT,MAYBE SHE SHOULD LISTEN TO THE CRISP, CLEAR VOICE OF NATALIE COLE, SO PLEASE DON'T SAY ""IT'S JUST HER STYLE"",FORGET IT."
2,Really poorly done,"I don't think I have ever heard a poorly done work by Foster. Until now that is, this is an unbelievably bad job especially when compared to her first album. It is impossible to really tell what has happened with her voice now that she has matured. It took years to get this album done. There is no one quite like this girl, and Foster knows this. I just hope he feels guilty enough to remix this thing or come out with a entirely new work. Renee can't possibly be happy with this."
3,Awwww,"Get out your equalizers. The engineers really dropped the ball and forgot whose name is on the CD. I had to re-master the entire CD raising the vocals by 7dB and lowering the music by 3dB. Fortunately, I have the software/hardware to do it and now I have a great CD : )Renee, don't EVER let anyone record you like that.Foster, I love you but 50 lashes with a wet noodle for allowing the drowning out of such a beautiful voice with music.Would I still recommend the CD? Yes, that's why I gave it 3 stars instead of 2. So far, all comments about the Lover Man track are on target - its really quite superb!"
5,Worth The Wait,"I have been waiting for this cd for a couple of years now. I discovered her self-titled cd a few years back after getting into the sitcom ""Still Standing."" I was really amazed with what she was able to do with her voice at such a young age. I saw this one advertised and have had it in my wish list for a long time. I was extremely pleased with this cd. It has a little more of a serious tone to it then her self-titled one, but is no less magnificent. There is still a lot of joy in the up-tempo tunes. She brings a wonderful smokiness (don't know why that word occurred to me, but it keeps popping in my mind) to the ballads on this one. This is not a pop music cd; it is jazz and her voice is absolutely perfect for every song on here. If you want some good, well executed, classy music, then this cd is perfect for you."
3,Not as good as Self Titled Album,"Renee has a great voice, but this time tamed down some of the vocal dynamics that I liked in her previous album. Worth a cheap buy if you like her, but not her best work yet."
4,Whatever!,The bottom line is that this girl can sing. My husband is continually amazed when I tell him how young she is. I can hardly wait to hear what she does 10-20-30 years in the future.I really like the mix of boogie-woogie and slow standards on this CD.Great listening from a major voice.
3,"Skylark, do you have anything to say to me?","The answer is yes if you like slow songs. This is a pretty good album, but not nearly as good as her debut. The problem, in my opinion, is there is too much ""sap"" and not enough ""pizazz"". Don't get me wrong, there are some ""GREAT"" songs on here, but where Renee really shines is on the fun stuff like THANKS FOR THE BOOGIE RIDE and AIN'T WE GO FUN and there just isn't enough of it! I think they could of substituted a few of the slower songs and had a better result. Renee also wrote a couple songs herself and while they are good songs in their own right, I don't think they fit with the rest of the album. Hold me now is my favorite of those. With that said, I recommend this album for songs like MIDNIGHT MAN, STARS FELL ON ALABAMA, SKYLARK and the 2 up-tempo songs mentioned above. But if this is your first album purchase for Renee, I recommend her previous album first. Either way, you will enjoy both, I know I do"
5,fantastic music.. superb singer..,once again Renee Olstead just knocked me out.. she is absolutely spectacular when she kicks out the vocals.. she is very likely the best young singer in a generation.. buy the CD and spend some time getting to know her voice.. she is great..
5,The Timeless Voice - Renee Olstead,"I shake my head and ask how can this young woman sing like that! All the tracks on the album are wonderful! Three stand outs are:""Lover Man"" is a musical roller coaster showing Renee's great range going from light soaring highs to gut hitting lows and everything in between.""Stars Fell On Alabama"" is a sweet dream of years gone past.""My Baby Just Cares For Me"" is fun and sassy. Renee ""sure does"" sing it great!Than Renee ""Stone Country's"" (Please re-release this album!) us with three songs she co-wrote with David Foster with a country flavor:""Hold Me Now, Midnight In Austin Texas (very bold, bluesy and flirty) and Nothing But The Blame"" are great songs. NBTB really soars , you feel the emotion from this amazing young singer. Renee was 14 when she recorded her much loved self-titled CD released in 04; she was probably 16 or 17 when most of this album was recorded. So young, so talented."
5,Simply the best!,"Skylark is a stunning follow up to Renee's 2004 debut album. A great mix of standards and original material. All 13 tracks are so wonderful with no fillers. Renee can sing a dreamy ballad, the blues or playful swing very convincingly. ""Lover Man"" is the most incredible 5 minutes I have ever heard in my 55 years! ""Hold Me Now"" is simply beautiful. Gene Krupa and Anita O'Day would be proud to hear what Renee has done with ""Thanks for the Boogie Ride"" from 1941, swing is alive and well! In an era of sound alike and look alike ""popular"" music, Renee has a truly unique sound. Her music will be with me forever! Do yourself a favor and buy this CD."
4,Enjoyable Listen,"I enjoyed Renee Olstead's self titled album. I gave Skylark to my daughter but had a chance to listen to it. I love the standards and Reneee covers many on this CD. She really does make these her own and the songs I've heard sung by dozens of singers seem fresh and new. While she is not my favorite among current female singers, she certainly fits in the regular rotation."
1,vhs movie,"to whom it may concern,i had been looking for this movie for a long time,and i found it on EBAY,and ordered it,and guess what,it took a whole month of waiting,and i never got it,had to get my money back....thanks much,still trying to find it some where else."
1,"Condensed Version of 2 Volume Set, inaccurate listing","After ordering this edition, I discovered it is a one volume condensed version of the original 2 volume set. The afterword states it has ""slightly less than half"" of the poems found in the original. Whether or not the reader wants to pay 30% of the two volume price for 45% of the content is their call, but the product listing is inaccurate as it stands. Personally, I would have bought the two volume set had I known - few people have a casual interest in 19th Century American poems, and those who do would probably prefer a comprehensive collection. I am not sure why this condensed edition exists, but raspberries to the publisher and Amazon for not making its limited status very clear in title and product listing."
3,Not Vista ready,"I have Vista installed, and it was a pain dealing with the drivers the software U lead 8 bundled installed Ok, but it messed up with AERO the program crashes from time to time, it does the job, but not as expected, at least with Vista."
1,"Terrible Product, Worse Service","The product works terrible, but the customer service is even worse. Their email support team just drags you around in circles without helping you at all. I highly recommend the Cyberlink DVD Maker 2.0. Works great. Buy anything but this product."
3,audio video to USB,"This device works on video very well, but the audio is distorted. I have only tried it on one computer so far so I can't say for sure if the problem is universal or not. I tried adjusting the level on the input, and also tried several sources of audio with the same result. A work around for this is to send the audio in through the mic/line in jack and use the device for only video."
2,More like classic Jazz,"This album contains many classic jazz standards of the 1950's. It is 'easy listening' at its roots, not the later light music or beautiful music or muzak which I personally think of as easy listening. This disc has songs by Sarah Vaughn, Nina Simone, Julie London, and Judy Garland, amongst many others. Some, such as Fred Astaire singing 'Night and Day' are not anything like what I might call easy listening. They are jazz vocal classics. For that - this is a fine collection. For the easy listening radio favorites of the 60's and 70's - well, this album has none."
2,Good to look at - not to play,"I had one of these. From the box the action was very high and hard to play. I had a shop asjust it and change out the low grade strings. The tuners aren't that nice either. The strings fall out of tune pretty fast. For a first mandolin I would recommend the Johnson solid top or Kentucky KM140S instead.If you just want some wall art... well, this mandolin is pretty."
4,Hide U - Kosheen,UK Maxi Single Track Listing for :'HIDE U' - KOSHEEN1) John Creamer & Stephane K Radio Edit - 3:322) John Creamer & Stephane K Remix Edit - 5:313) Rollo & Sister Bliss Remix Edit - 6:294) Album Version - 4:122001
5,Good Loving Guide,"This video is quite nice. I bought this for my sweetheart and I. This is the first time I ever bought something like this, so if you are like me, I think you will find it impressive. The video seems to break you in gently and then WOW! There were three loving couples, but there was one particular couple that I thought had the most passion and I gather that is why they put them toward the end. They were also in the bonus track: from Volume One, of which I think I will purchase. I enjoyed listening to the views of people on lovemaking and the sense of humor they had with it. All in all, I did like this video and it's wonderful to have a tasteful video on Black loving couples."
3,Would you like some cheese with your Strangeland?,"This movie was *terrible!* It wasn't even good in a bad way... and that's pretty bad... I gave it 3 stars simply because the piercings and tattoos were cool, and because the soundtrack is one of the best I've ever heard."
3,good but a bit dumb,"i realy enjoyed strangeland, but saw some stupid stuff in it. Like someone else said, not all people with tatoos are goth freaks that consider themselves ""modern primitives."" my mom has a tatoo and i have never seen her brand herself or suspend herself from our ceiling. but it was fun to watch and the novelty of Dee Snider writing and acting in it was kind of cool. I just didnt like the stereotyping."
2,Dee needs to stick to music,"Although his intentions are there, there is no atmosphere of fright in this movie. I think he should have directed it with someone other than himself in this movie.The plot is not a dull one and therefor should have been performed by someone like Anthony Hopkins. The scenes are sick and twisted but that is good however, Dee should really stick to making music as I didnt find him a bit scary but rather comical.If you like gore and sexual exploitation, this movie is for you. If you want to be scared, look elsewhere.Thank you."
1,"Oh, please!","No, I didn't take personal offense at the storyline. It was actually somewhat interesting. Still, I hated this film, it hurt me to watch because it was so WEAK. The violence was very fake looking, the acting was horrible with the lone excpetion of MEDIOCRE Kevin Gage. Dee Snider's Captain Howdy was laughable, half due to Snider's acting, and half due merely to the way he looks. He wasn't menacing. The ending is especially weak. Pieplow's direction is completely bland and uninspired, never even once inspiring any sort of fear. The ""philosophical"" underpinnings of body piercing and torture and pain and etc. were as laughable as the rest of the script. I wish I could give a half star rating, but I can't, but that's how I feel, so at least you all know my intentions."
3,Dee Snider's Strangeland,"I only gave this movie three stars, not at all because it is a bad movie, because it isn't, but for one, it needs a little more detail. This movie is definetly one that will scare you though. If not scare you, make you think.. if you know what I mean ^_^"
3,I could of done without the philosophy,"I liked the storyline and the creepy situation of anyone being fooled and lured into a madman's home. I loved that Robert Englund was in it and looked normal. I got annoyed with Dee Snider's voice and his attempt to be menacing... The movie overall was good, I expected it to be more freaky. I thought it was funny that people in the movies with body peircings and tattoo's were all depicted as freaky weirdos who were different and set away from the rest of society. I know so many people who have tattoo's and piercings and they aren't any darker or mysterious. They don't go to crazy goth clubs and brand themselves on a table. All in all I gave this movie three stars because 1. I really liked the music throughout it. 2. Robert Englund is in it 3. Some of the tattoo's are really cool."
2,Not As Good As Expected,"By what I had read here on the reviews the other day, I thought this was going to be a better-than-average movie. Turns out it was okay, but nothing great. There are some good ideas, and the plot sounded interesting, but I thought that the movie just didn't fullfill what it could've. I admit that it had its moments here and there, but not totally. Dee Snider did a pretty good job though. The scenes with the people in his torture chamber were quite bizarre and twisted I have to admit. I just think that the movie could've been better. I wouldn't even really consider this a horror flick. If you want that, pick up the Evil Dead Collector's Edition. Now that's horror."
3,Worth watching.,"The acting was not the best, but the whole plot of the movie how it is done was awsome. This movie takes the role of a bad guy who has been reformed, yet the citizens won't forgive him. Kinda changes how you view the bad guy."
1,The worst movie ever!,"I watched about 1/2 of it and turned it off. Boring and stupid. I can compare it some scary movies made in the 80's! What a waste of money! Don't buy it, for sure."
1,Watch at own risk,"Sick, twisted film about goth-looney Snider who abducts young people through an online chat site and tortures them in his own little house of horrors (wall to wall S&M, body piercing etc). Gloomy, poorly written junk that not only thrives in non-stop unpleasantness but subjects an innocent girl not once but twice to Sniders wretched wrath. Anyone who views this as entertainment needs their own head checked."
1,THE LAMEST PIECE I HAVE EVER VIEWED!,"DO YOUR SELF A HUGE FAVOR AVOID THIS FILM, NOT ONLY DOES IT BLOW CHUNKS BUT, IT ALSO DRAGS ON AND ON AND ITS UNDER 1 HOUR AND FORTY MINUTES LONG. THAT SHOULD GIVE YOU A BIG HINT."
3,TWISTED TWISTED MOVIE .......,This is diffenately one of the most twisted movies I have ever seen. I have to say Dee Snider acts better than he sings. And for him to make such a movie is really surprising. I would like to see more of his work. And for those of you who like more of the twisted and bizzare movies this one is diffenately for you.
4,"Dee, Dee, Dee..........","Dee, just when I relegated you into the ""where are they now?"" list, you come out at the turn of the millenium with trash this cool. Captain Howdy is a character who can easily rival Jason, Freddy and The Tall Man. As old as you might get, you are sure to rightfully take the honor of being my parents' worst nightmare. This movie needs to be watched twice. The first time without narration, you'll get the horrific aspect. The second time with narration, it's a laugh attack (I still can't get over that extra who had to hobble his way on crutches up the hill!)."
5,Wonderfully Sadistic,This movie is covering your face peeking through your fingers gory its that gross but terribly entertaining at the same time. Dee Synder and Robert Englund in the same film awesome simply awesome.So much on the edge of your seat gore and suspense you'll wanna scream but you'll be too afraid to break the stitches
5,Strangeland,"I thought Stangeland was incredible. Dee Snider is a terrific actor. He makes his character so believable. I makes you think about how many sick people there are out in the internet waiting to prey on young girls. It should make teenage girls think twice about who they talk on the net. Even though it's just a movie, it could very well be something that happens or has happened in real life."
2,StrangeLand is STRANGE,"Well, they got the title right! This is the strangest movie I've ever watched. It wasn't scary, but just plain weird. If you're looking for movies for Halloween, don't waste your money. If you're in to s&m and pain, then go for it!"
3,"funny and gorss, but not scary.","O.k. i do not know wath the reviewers were on win they were wirting, but this movie is not scary or gory. it is not all that good but it does have some good parts.1997. Artisan. ??? MINS.Rated R For Horror, Some Torture/Violence, Language, Nudity and ..."
1,not even good,"When I purchased devils rejects this movie came free. I watched it and hated it.Its about a sick individual who is on the internet trying to get women to come over for ""a party"" when they do he torchers them, with hooks piercings, the whole nine yards. After he is cought he is put into a mental institution. When he comes back as a nice guy the town people still want him dead. He gets beat up so slowly he tries to take on some of the town people 1 by 1. Now he then goes back for the girl that escaped and well doesnt live because her father kills him. Its not a good movie at all."
1,My roommate actually sharpened her teeth like CAPT HOWDY!,"I am not lying...she loved it, I was bored and instead of being scared at all I was annoyed by Captain Howdy never shutting the hell up! I wanted to scream because he babbled on endlessly. I will have to say seeing Robert Englund in it was one thing that made the flick oh and the bands at the end was a nice touch but overall....YAWN."
3,Another WTF movie,"Strangeland is not a horror film, or at least an ordinary one. True chances are you will find this in the Horror section of most rental or retail however as in content, it ranges more along the lines of a suspens thriller. Dee Snider plays Captain Howdy and sexual predator who lures teens through an online chatroom. From there he tortures them with piercing. For the first half of the movie he is basically torturing his victims and being poetic. Then in the second half he has been rehabilitated after his arrest. However a group of drunken hicks don't like it so they hang him. From there he reverts back to his old ways and gets his revenge.The reason this is a WTF movie is because of content. IT holds gratiouse nudity and scenes of torture. THis is not for everyone however as it is most nausiating. Proceed with caution."
4,"Terrifying, on many different levels!","Although I saw Strangeland many months ago, the horror and terrifying impact that it leaves on it's viewers is always clear. Not only was Strangeland chilling in the way that every horror movie is, but even more so is the sad, scary truth that it really happens to people. I wish more thriller/horror films were made for this reason, to make people think, to make them aware that there are dangers in this world that we don't think of, yet are everywhere... just a click away! What's frightening is that this kind of danger is so commonplace, and it can be right at our fingertips."
5,AWESOME!,"The first time i saw it was when i was at home watching scream 2 and after that came on Strangeland. I decided to stay up a little later and watch. I was soo terrified i had to keep watching it. I love the script, and the way Dee Snider acts as the horrifying internet creep. I usually dont freak out when i see scary movies, but just thinking about being one of the people he tortured is scarier than hell! GET THIS MOVIE! It will stick in your head for a long time after seeing it!"
3,Mullet man...with a vengeance!,"Dee Snider is back and this time, he's not just going to drive your dad insane with those fist pumping jams...he's got tattoos, a menacing pseudonym and he wants to pierce you with some really big needles in some really odd places!Dee portrays the sadistic Charleton Hendricks (a.k.a. Captain Howdy) who lures girls from chatrooms to his suburban home where he tortures and pierces them.I won't dissect the film...there's not much to it. There's blood and piercing and heavy music and that's about it. Really, the acting is mediocre at best, the script weak but it's a horror flick...who gives?Let the viewer be warned that this film is very graphic, lots of S&M; and heavily suggesting sexual assault (even I found it completely ridiculous at certain points). If you're at all squeamish, I suggest that you stay away from ""Strangeland""."
3,Dee is bad,A good theme that would have been better off had Dee not had the hero(at least how I view these guys) role. The cop seemed like the only working actor in this flic. Maybe just a little cheap but otherwise a movie to be recommended.
2,Silliness Abounds!,"So, another ""shocking"" portrayal of the seamy underside of life! All the kids in the 'burbs can chill to the antics of Goths, fetishists and body-mod enthusiasts while Mom n' Dad have a heart attack! Woo, scary! Never mind that most of the ""real"" freaks skulking around in the background are REALLY just delusional alterna-nerds who desperately wanted to be in a movie. God bless Suspension of Disbelief! You've gotta love Dee Snider, but face it, he was better in ""Pee-Wee's big adventure."""
1,Dee Snider should never direct another film,"I saw this film and, I thought that it was one of the worst movies that I have ever seen. I was not because of the content but, mainly the acting and the storyline behind this film. I can't understand why the film even made it to the theater it shouldn't even have been straight to video."
1,Strangeland is a waste land,"I love horror movies but Strangeland is simply horrible thanks to bad acting, direction and writing. Snider even steals a big scene from ""Silence of the Lambs"" with no shame. Stay clear if you like movies and still have brain cells."
4,Great Thriller,A must have horror that has a one of a kind plot and a unique message about life and people.
4,Parents Beware! Your Children Are Doomed!...,"STRANGELAND combines two current fears among parents, those being 1)- Kids gone wild on the Internet. 2)- The weirdos they'll run into in chat rooms, etc.! Dee Snyder's story takes these fears and amps them up to horrific proportions! This makes for a winning combo, w/ Snyder's ""Capt. Howdy"" character guaranteed to keep granny up at night thinking about those full-body tats and all that metal in his face! There's a lot to like here, including Robert Englund (EATEN ALIVE, A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET, BEHIND THE MASK) as a beer-swilling hick! Snyder himself is quite good in his ""modern primitive"" role. He chews the scenery w/ zeal and gusto. Great stuff... P.S.- Yep, Capt. Howdy was the demon in Regan's ouija board in THE EXORCIST..."
4,twisted movie!,"there's some bad acting, and some holes in the plot, but overall pretty damn entertaining. worth seeing dee snider as a sicko"
1,Distortion of History,"Not worth reading, as the author seems to add his opinionscleverly weaving imaginary history instead of factual reporting.Pedagogical and patronizing as some of the western authorsare Mr. Getz went on to belittle Indian aspirations for freedomand the struggle. It should be remembered here thatGeorge Washington did what Mr Bose did a couple of centurieslater indidentally against the same enemy, .i.e British. Howwould he like if the father of his nation is considered asmall fry by history books the world over.Madhav"
4,Thought Provoking,"One of the words that can best describe this albums content is variety. It may bounce around too much for some people. My favorite song on it is Butterfly by Tori Amos, but I like the heavier stuff too, like the Rage Agains The Machine track. Check the lineup and if you see enough artists that you like, get it. Otherwise pick up a different CD."
3,Little Disappointed,"The case was cracked, so I was a little disappointed. However, for the price, the CD was good. I received the CD in the mail in a few days."
1,Doesn't contain all the songs in the film...where thehell is Sons of Elvis??,"If you've seen the movie you'll remember the scene at the party where the girl is sexual assaulted, well the music playing then was ""Formaldehyde"" by Sons of Elvis and I'm highly displeased so I am giving this album a 1 out of 5"
3,pretty good soundtrack.. for a few reasons,well.. its got 2 GREAT Tori songs... a great Liz Phair song.. & a great Eve's Plum song.... thats all i listen to from the cd really... but the cd's worth gettin for those
3,I'm a Liz Phair completist,"I only picked this album up during the Liz Phair drought waiting (seemingly forever!) for her ""whitechocolatespaceegg"" album. Her Grammy-nominated song, ""Don't Have Time,"" really isn't one of her better tunes, but it is a standout on this soundtrack ... which should say something about the overall quality here.This isn't a bad album, per se, but it's ultimately very ordinary."
4,Compact Cable Spacesavers,"As I wrote in a previous review, for anyone who prizes compactness, these spring loaded roll-up cables are ""just the ticket"". Through a series of ratcheted stops you can extend the cable through several lengths - up to 3 feet and then, when finished, the spring mechanism will retract it back to its compact form. I have about 10 of these (since in addition to use with my laptop, I also use them around the house; where, by extending it to the exact length I need, saves me the headache of having to wrap and tie those loose unsightly cables that we constantly have to put up with between peripherals).The only concern with constant extension and retraction (when used with a portable system) is the possibility that the wire, being exercised will eventually break. With all of these cables I have had over a 10 year period, I have had only one fail - so they are pretty resilient."
4,Very striking artwork.,"The folktales themselves are interesting enough, but this book's outstanding merit is its illustrations, which, indeed, furnished the inspiration for it. The illustrator, Norovsambuugin Baatartsog, does his work not with brush and ink, but by cutting silhouettes out of black paper, freehand. They're intricate, and, aside from it being quite astonishing that anyone could do such work with scissors and no guiding drawing, they'd be striking in any medium."
4,"good book, lousy deal","I enjoyed the book. It is very well written as a reference for the language. And it is interesting to read the motivation behind different features. I first used Rexx about 18 years ago, and I still think it's an excellent scripting language. I use the Korn shell every day, but I find it much easier to write scripts in Rexx. However, I don't think this is a good deal. [The cost] is WAY too much to spend for a xeroxed paperback copy. [Also,] it's NOT in a textbook binding..."
2,Not worth the price,"I want to make it clear that this rating has nothing to do with the actual content of the book, but the book itself. For the price, it is an extreme rip off. The pages look like they went through a very bad copy machine; to the point that some were not even readable. The binding is terrible as well. I ended up returning the book, which is a shame because there are not enough good REXX books left on the market for those of us that use REXX on a daily basis."
4,Good REXX Book,"Good book for REXX as both a reference manual and as a way to learn it. I use REXX on an IBM mainframe (batch and dialog manager) and needed this more as the reference manual than a ""how to"" book."
3,no laurels to rest on,"I first used REXX back in 1982 when it was called REX. In those days, since it provided a decently structured interface to a very clumsy executive (VM/SP with CMS), we all marveled at the language. Today, it is clumsy at best. The author's claims that the language is ""designed for people, not machines"" make it sound as if he has achieved some magical apotheosis. He has not. As reasonably structured ""glue"" for an archaic operating system environment, REXX makes a stab at being an equal of the Korn shell but misses the mark. I wouldn't go any farther than that in trumpeting its power, flexibility, or elegance."
5,Hilarious,"Inept, quirky, and useless superheroes in the same vein as ""Mystery Men"". Full of puns, bizarre non-sequitors, and inexplicable weirdness. Highly recommended for weirdos of all ages."
2,5 Stars for the Series 2 stars for the dvds.,"Forget the fact that this dvd set is devoid of any extras. I can even forgive Disney for not including one of the 1st season episodes (The Tick vs. The Mole Men) in this set. What I really despise is the dvd presentation itself. If you are going to release a great series that many have been waiting years for, please do not give us such terrible transfers!!!! For one thing most of the episodes are missing the audio for the first 4 - 5 seconds !!! Second, the transfers are not up to par for dvd standards!!! They look like bootlegs that you can pick up on ebay !!! I thought this was Disney . Stop using old analog masters and go back and strike up some new digital ones ! This is the 21st century you know. Unless Disney gets their act straight , I won't be getting any future releases. I've already returned my copy for a refund."
5,Awesome!,"Spoon! This is one of the great cartoons of the 1990's! Even if you aren't a comic fan, you'll love it!"
3,Coming Soon: The Tick Vs. Buena Vista Home Entertainment,"As great as the show is these DVDs practically scream rush job. The reasons have been well stated in other posts (missing episode, bad navigation, no extras, iffy transfer quality).This said, I bought the DVD and will buy the next one. Hopefully, Buena Vista will realize that there is a big enough market for these DVDs and do a decent job with Season 2.Fans of The Tick deserve better."
4,Worth The Wait - Sorta,"I love the Tick. I loved the comic book, I loved the live action show and I loved this brilliant but short lived animated series.The shows look great. The packaging is good. The cartoons are just as I remembered them.There are no extras on this disc at all which is a big dissapointment. Commentary by Ben Edlund (The Tick's Creator) would have been nice. A still image gallery would have rocked.I am also really mad that they didn't include episode 11, however I am hoping they add it to season three (since it was a very short season).I am very glad the Tick is finally here!Spoooooon!!!!"
2,not as good as i remembered,I rememebered the cartoons being better but I guess I made the mistake of buying the DVD and being reminded it is just sad and not that entertaining - ok bits are ok but overall I wouldn't advise this as a purchase - stay with other cartoons or anime....
4,Tickle me blue!,I found this series back in the late 90's when it was in syndication on Commedy Central and it became one of my favorite cartoons ever. The humor and satire in this series are so good I'm shocked that this was originally marketed to kids and not a more aduilt audience. This series is that good. This DVD release is barebones as previously mentioned by other reviewers thus the 4 star rating. The missing episode was one of my least favorites so I will not miss it. I've waited five years and I doubt Di$ney will release a better set of this season in the near future so for now I'm happy to add this to my DVD collection.
1,Yawn...,"Two+ hours of my life I will never get back... even Burt Lancaster could not save this slow, poorly dubbed (during the operatics) version of the Phantom, though he tried his best. There were a few good moments, but getting to them through the rest it was hardly worth it."
1,"Campy, Hammy, and weird!","This movie was too campy and marred by overacting and it didn't have much to do with the original story at all the only thing that remains is the names Erik and Christine, this movie was boring and the fact that you never got to see The Phantom's (Erik's) face is really odd and also adding a father for Erik just took away from the original premise that his mind and soul were damaged because his family rejected him because of his deformed face and making him obsessed with Christine because she is the exact lookalike image of his deceased mother was just too weird! I also didn't like how they made Christine so wishy washy and ditzy!"
2,The Bad Parts Outweight The Few Good Parts!,This Phantom of the Opera mini series had some good parts but most of this mini series was horrible and they really butchered the tale!
1,Another non-musical screen adaption (yawn yawn),"Well...I must say that out of all the Phantom of the Opera's I've seen, none of them even come close to being perfectley exact compared to either Gaston whats his names book, orAndrew Lloyd Webbers fantastic musical adaption. I truly and honestly believe that there should be an Andrew Lloyd Webber musical stage to screen movie adaption. If there were, I know hundreds of people whom would go see it, including myself. Over all this movie sucked, and is not worth the time, or money buying or renting it, compared to how untrue it is to the beautiful opera by Andrew Lloyd Webber.Was this review helpfull to you?"
3,Interesting to say the least,"Well... this was interesting. Majorly off from the original plot. Glaringly off actually, which was dissapointing. The acting was pretty good, Charles Dance was good, I liked his wry humor... he wasn't as brooding as the original Erik. I'm not a purist, but I had a difficult time wrapping my brain around this movie, though it was entertaining.The singing was good, dubbed, but most of the time, decently done so. Carlotta and the rats made the movie worth watching... That was just.........poetic!If you are a big fan of POTO, then this would be nice for the collection, but... I'm still waiting for a decent version.... unfortunately Michael Crawford won't be in the upcoming movie... that would have been a smash hit and a piece of art to be treasured for years... oh well...If you are a purist, skip this movie... if you are looking for POTO related entertainment, check it out."
5,Entertaining and intriguing,"After we got over the initial shock that this movie was not going to have the great Andrew Lloyd Webber music in it, it was great to view. The comic approach to classical opera would appeal to anyone, and yet it does not compromise the greatness of opera itself. Also, the great storyline is woven into this setting with intrigue and it is all very pleasing."
5,The Lullaby the Phantom sang made me weak in the knees.....,"Granted, there is a lot of add lib in this film about the Phantom's past and Christine's employment as a servant in Philippe's house as a girl, but that is what adds strength to it. I don't mind that I never got to see the Phantom's face, (probably would've given me nightmares anyway!) Even though the singing is dubbed, it is done very well--with the exception of Carlotta, who just cannot stand that Christine is better than her. I laughed when the Phantom dumped the suitcase full of rats on Carlotta. Served her right for trying to ruin Christine's debut. I got weak in the knees when I heard him sing tha lullaby to Christine. I cried when Erik fell off the roof. Sounded like bones were broken."
5,An Inspritation,"'The Phantom of the Opera', the mini-series, is a true inspiration to anyone who has the pleasure of seeing it. Not only is the musical score breath-taking, but the acting is marvelous and the dialogue is written in such a way as to cause laughter and tears at the same time. This movie opened my eyes to opera, as well as to life itself."
3,"Nice scenery, little to do with the book","This is a well-filmed Phantom, being the only movie actually filmed at the Paris Opera house. The plot has almost nothing to do with the original novel, except the names of Erik and Christine. Overall, it's a sweet movie, with some interesting ideas about Erik's history. This was later turned into a musical, simply entitled Phantom, and is basically identical to the movie except for the musical numbers, which are largely unimaginative and weak. This movie gets three stars for the on location footage, and the acting is pretty good overall."
5,One of the best films available,"I highly recommend this film! It has a very rare quality about it. The highlight is one of the most moving performances of opera I've ever seen (part of Faust). A truly beautiful creation and luckily it's not the only piece of brilliant opera in the film, the singing is put into the context of the play and the acting is world class. I can not recommend it highly enough."
5,What a mic!,"Wow! I bought this on a hurry for my college (music student) and it's sound so great that my friends used to trade their mics (even Sure brand) with mine because of the quality sound of this microphone. I am pretty pleasant, really for me was a surprise!!! Unfortunately I forgot it on my car for 3 days and the temperature was around 90 degrees... I think the parts inside melted :( but I'd use it for 4 years so it was good."
5,atr-30 mike,The ATR-30 Microphone is excellent for use as a Ham Radio Microphone especially with the ICOM radios that require a dynamic element. The audio quality is superb and punches through 'pile-ups'.
3,size too small,The sizes are small and sleeve too short. Good material though. I reckon buy one size larger if not it looks weird.
5,Excellet Flea Comb,1. The silver color makes it easy to spot fleas caught in the tongs.2. The light silver color makes it easy to see if the comb is dirty and needs cleaning.3. The tongs are tightly spaced making it PERFECT for short haired dogs and cats and the tongs don't miss a flea.4. The tongs are a bit longer than the rest of the flea combs I own and my longer haired cats love it when I comb them with it.5. A lot of hair is gathered in the tong teeth but every single cat loves to get combed with it - long or short haired.
1,Broke quickly,It didn't take long before one of the tines of the comb broke off and scratched my poor dog. She had a scab for a week. This shouldn't have happened.
1,Did not work with my transmitter and other pack.,"Every time I try to use this additional pack, it can't seem to get a signal from the transmitter. The only time it seemed to work was when it was held against the other pack. To be fair, it could have been a problem with my transmitter somehow, but the pack that I bought has not worked like I hoped it would."
2,Skip This One,"Unfortunately this particular DVD isn't all that great. It doesn't save your spot when it turns off, which is a bigger problem than you think because it turns itself off after being idle for some time. I've also had problems with it not syncing up the audio and video. I've had to stop the dvd and start it again to fix the problem, which you shouldn't have to do."
3,"Yes its good, but not that good...","I have watched many animes and GOKUDO is just something I would say rather plainly so far, is nothing exceptional. At certain times, it can be dry but it can be funny too. But for 26 episodes altogether, the story doesn't have a story and becomes a mix mash of silly tales of Gods & Demons.It can be fun to watch when there is nothing to watch at all... but its more of rent than to own."
1,The glass is more than half empty,"I dont care who you are, this album was a big let down. We have all delighted over their self entitled release for a couple of years now, and to have this come next really makes me consider why I am still living.This is exactly what the Stills did, but they had an excuse. Thats what happens to a band that loses key members. Given that they had a tough act to follow, Kasabian is better than this. I bought the CD the week that it came out, and it hasnt grown on me. I dont keep it in my cd book anymore because I have never had the impulse to listen to it after the 3rd time. When Amazon tried to recommend it to me, I said 'Not Interested"" biotch.If you like Kasabian and have never heard this record, go ahead and give it a go. You won't like it, but at least you will be able to tell your friends how dissapointing one of the worlds most talked about band's sophomore efforts was."
4,grows on you over time,"Kasabian's new album does not have the same number of instantly catchy songs the first album in known for. Listening to the album just once may be disappointing, especially if you are expecting the exact same edgy style. Not to despair; ""Empire"" is truly an album to let grow on you. Over time I have come to appreciate it even more than ""Kasabian."" The new Kasabian sounds very familiar to a new band from Norway called KEN, whose new album ""STOP! LOOK! Sing Songs of Revolution!"" sounds like a combination of Kasabian and the Beatles."
4,Took a while to really like it,"I have to admit, when I first listened to this cd, I was disappointed. I loved the first 2 songs, but felt like the cd went downhill from there. I've listened to it a lot more and have grown to really like it. I also actually saw them live last night in my town. The songs that I didnt really like on this cd were great live. It changed my whole perspective on the songs. After seeing them live and listening to the album again, I really, really like it. I could even say I like it better than their first. Their debut still only has maybe 5 songs I really like."
2,They sent the wrong cd.,"I ordered Kasabian's Empire cd but got the Juno cd instead. I hope that it can be un-did, homeskillet. Thank-you."
4,Music from HBO's John from Cincinnati first episode,"Look no further for the awesome music playing during the closing surf montage in the HBO/John from Cincinnati's premiere episode. It's Kasabian's ""Sun Rise Light Flies"". Haven't heard the rest of the album but this song rocks!"
2,Kasabian has run out of ideas,"I like several songs on Kasabian's old album but there were also many poor ones. Still on this album I dont know if i could say that there are any songs better than Club Foot, Reason Is Treason, and Processed Beats. It seems Kasabian has gone psychedelic and also run out of ideas in the process, there is nothing special or creative on this album."
1,WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT....,"....the first album was fantastic. This one is terrible. It's that simple. Apparently their main creative person quit the band and the results are evident. There is a much better production on this disc and maybe that is part of the problem.....Listen to the sound snips on Amazon and judge for yourself, I'm certain you'll agree with me and save yourself some money to spend on good music. This isn't it!"
4,Requires repeat listening.,"So far I've listened twice through. While they do not sound as fresh as on the first CD, they still manage to be at least interesting on most of the cuts. I'd like to hear it a few more times yet, but an example is that the first time I listened to the 'Empire' track, I did not like it. After repeated listening it grew on me, and not like cancer. It's for sure not 'Clubfoot', but as John Mayall once said, ""What did you come here for, to hear on old record?"" Tracks 2, 3, 5 and 8 are all pretty enjoyable. The final track is a bit pretentious and over the top, but if that was what they were going for, they got it."
2,Their sophmore CD is pretty disappointing,"Kasabian dumped their lead guitarist while recording this CD and the remaining band went for a very different sound from their popular first CD. What we get this time around is more a collection of pop songs with the vocals often pushed up front. The dance/club/rave style of the first CD is not really represented here except maybe by the ""sun/rise"" track. Its a big change for the band and I dont think they carry it off very well. With the lyrics pushed up front in virtually every track, we are forced to listen to lyrics that aren't attention-grabbing. Just a fair warning that this CD sounds nothing at all like their previous CD...."
5,from Literary Ashland,"Everyone likes a good dystopia, from Wells and London to Zamyatin, Huxley, Orwell, Burgess and M. T. Anderson's Feed. In Fast Eddie-King of the Bees, Robert Arellano takes us to the dystopic Boston of the near future, where a big-footed pickpocketing contortionist becomes the leader of underground Dig City.Eddie, the pickpocket, starts out as a street orphan mentored by Shep, the faux blind street professor who schools his rats in both grifting and the liberal arts. Eddie leaves Shep's tuteledge in search of his birth parents, but Pauly (the Mayor of Ho-Ho-Kus, New Jersey) and his wife Merry (as in Christmas) fall short. Eddie finds himself falling back through the rabbit hole to the underground city. There's an Oedipal subplot or two--read the title slowly and a little backward and you can get to Oedipus, King of Thebes. There's plenty of other nameplay and wordplay too (go reread Oedipus and match up the names their Greek counterparts for fun)."
4,Bargain,"This is a good saw for the DIY. It is mostly metal, not plastic. I just finished doing my countertops with 12x12 granite tiles. The saw performed fine. It will wet you, but most wet saws will. The guide fence is fine, but dont trust the scale, measure yourself. Just make sure you throw away the blade that comes with it, it is trash. I bought a good blade after trying the one that comes with the saw. Investing the few extra dollars was well worth it. The saw has plenty of rpms to handle granite, so it should work really well with anything else. You cant beat the price, it would cost you almost as much to rent a wet saw for a day. Delivery was fast."
3,Okay for small projects,"This made in China tile saw is worth exactly what it costs - which is less than what a decent diamond tile blade costs.Which is the first point to really know about this saw. Don't expect it to work AT ALL until you buy a new blade. The blade that comes mounted is absolutely worthless. So when you buy this saw also buy a brand named tile blade here at Amazon.This saw will really cost you about $120 once you pay for shipping and replace the blade, so if your project can be completed with about two days of renting a nice saw - go rent the professional saw. If renting isn't an option, then this saw WILL get the job done. But be prepared to fiddle with it to get your cuts done right.Mechanically the saw has been functional and it appears that it will make it through the current project and possibly the next as well."
5,Excellent Little Saw,"I bought this saw to do a kitchen backsplash project. I was pleased to see the sturdy metal construction and found it to have plenty of power to cut my 4 x 4 Travertine tiles. The saw blade that comes with it is 'el cheapo'. I spent another $35 bucks on a DeWalt diamond blade and was very pleased with the performance. With the new blade, it cut through the Travertine stone tiles like butter. Overall, this is a great saw for the DIY."
2,Cheap old school design,"This saw is the worst of old school cheap design.Too thin sheet metal with small screws threaded directly into the sheet metal. The motor is mounted to a wall of the sheet metal enclosure and the weight is too much for the wall to support. The motor was so far out of alignment that the blade would not turn until I disassembled the saw and straightened the wall. I have to assume that this was damage from being dropped during shipment even though both the inner and outer cartons were in perfect condition.I suppose it is good enough for the few tile jobs that I will use it for, but I shouldn't have to repair a tool before I can use it.I have heard it said that the best you should hope for is that you get what you paid for. I did, it was both cheap and inexpensive."
4,Tile Saw,Very with this product. It is not very powerful but it gets the job done and it was least expensive saw online.
3,Not yet used,"Unfortunately the clasp was too large for me to slip on the pendant. My other wonder is why it wasn't packaged as a circle, instead of it being folded. Didn't make sense."
1,This didn't hold up well,"I wore this a couple times with a pretty pressed glass amulet. One night, taking it off, the cord came apart from the metal in my hand. I have since bought black leather cord (for $4.88, from Wal-mart) and created my own cord, knotted at the back, to slip over my head. Not as good, but at least it won't rot or separate on me."
2,Not What I expected,The necklace Cord for Pendants was not the size I expected. By that I mean that the cord was very narrow. It did not have the thickness that I thought that I was getting and the clasp was so small that most would people find it hard to use. An extremely very poor value at $5.49 for each one!
3,"okay, but won't buy it again.","works for its purpose, but it looks a bit cheap to me...not that happy with it.."
3,New Skin For The Old Ceremony,"I adore Leonard Cohen and have been listening to him for at least 40 years, BUT somehow I missed this album along the way. It's okay, but definitely not his best work and not one that I'll play over and over."
4,Pretty Good,"I have had Cohens first three albums for several years and enjoy them profusely. The small stories he tells range from desolation, sardonic views of the world, to drunken hysteria. The album title shows that a lot of the songs are about love and this is true. This collection is not the strongest prose of Cohens but there are some very poppy and uplifting songs."
2,Not my favorite,"I have grown into quite the Leonard Cohen fan, but this particular CD goes to the bottom of the growing pile of my Cohen collection. I can't even remember why, just that I wasn't interested in listening to it again, unlike all of his others, which I play over and over, seemingly never tiring of them."
5,"""I'm sorry for smudging the air with my song ...""","A great collection of songs here, mostly exploring the areas of love and war. Probably the most famous song on the album is ""Chelsea Hotel #2"", a loving (but not too loving) tribute to Janis Joplin. Other highlights are ""Take This Longing"", ""A Singer Must Die"", ""Who By Fire"", ""There is a War"", and ""Is This What You Wanted"". And this is one of his few albums that doesn't have at least one screechingly bad song to ruin the flow. Can't go wrong buying this one."
4,Nice Case..Nothing Special,This case fits my Optio WP nicely. It can still be placed in my pocket even with the case which was my main concern. You can definitely buy cheaper cases for less and still get the basic functionality though. I have another case made for generic small digital cameras and it works just as well as this one. I do recommend this product but if you're on a budget just get a generic case. It will do just as well.
5,Perfect Fit !,"Probably the best thing you could purchase to protect your camera, especially those without a lens cover as my Pentax Optio W20. Fits like a glove yet east to remove. It also allows you to use the carry strap and the magnetic catch is very cool."
5,great construction,"I have a sheep dog who gets matted-this works great. The one piece ( except teeth) steel construction, means it holds up against anything I give it. I didn't want the flee comb cause I didn't need that."
4,Loaded fine,"I did not have any trouble with the program loading or updating. I have used TaxCut for years. Interface and menus could be a little clearer at times. They seem to change the look every year just enough to make you search for some of the things you used the year before. I think the people who had trouble with the software were earlier versions since the ad in January on Amazon for this one stated ""new version"" ."
1,Angry about no Mac version,"I've used TaxCut for the past two years and been happy with it. But now I am VERY unhappy that they have dropped their Macintosh version. I don't know what I'm going to do this year, [...]. I'm very disappointed in TaxCut for abandoning their Macintosh customers."
1,Problems Installing TaxCut05,"I have been using TaxCut for the last three years without trouble. This time I had a problem with installation on Windows XP. It is similar to a problem reported by another user here:The installation fails EVERY single time on the same spot (at 21%- C:\Program Files\TaxCut05\help\Us\mmvdpro.swf).I am not going to call them after hearing about the long wait times calling cutomer service. I will exchange the CD once, and if it fails again, I am switching to TurboTax."
2,"Throw ""Deduction Pro"" away and you'll be okay","I have used both Tax Cut and Turbo Tax at various times over the last several years, and generally find them to be about equivalent. Since Tax Cut shipped with ""Deduction Pro"", I thought it might be worth tracking charitable contributions in DP and importing them to Tax Cut. This was disastrous: it is unclear what exactly got imported, and when I attempted to re-import, I found a variety of problems: some items got double counted, other items (including property taxes!) previously entered had disappeared from Schedule A, and on other occasions Tax Cut failed to recognize the import file as valid and then crashed. Arghhhh!I still believe, however, that a judicious user can chuck the DP software (maybe save the CD sleeve) and do just fine."
5,No Problem Installing,"I check these reviews each year, and noticed the issues that some people stated intalling this software. I know my way around a PC, but this software installed and updated with ZERO issues, and seems to be running fine (I'll try and update this review later). I installed it on Windows XP. I've looked around the web and do not see any issues with spyware or anything else with this software. Considering the fact that electonic federal file was included, and it's cheaper than the competitor, I went with taxcut this year. I've switched before, and this imports turbotax files, so why not? Note that when installing ANY software, I always exit any applications and close anything besides virus software ( I run antivir and microsoft beta ) by right clicking the icons in my system tray in the lower right hand corner. A good idea is to also set a system restore point if you're running windows XP previous to loading. Enjoy!!!"
1,Is this spyware?,"Before you put your personal information in jeopardy, read the privacy statement. It outlines the vast amount of personal information collected by Block which is not limited to all the information in your return (including all of your checking, debit and credit card numbers, income, assets etc.), but gives Block permission to access information from your credit reports and the IRS. Are they really selling tax preparaton software or are you buying spyware? Read the Privacy Statement and decide for yourself."
2,can't use State form - totally lacking customer support,"After installing the Federal and one free State (Illinois), it won't let me prepare nor print a State return unless I get a valid unlock code, which would require a separate purchase.Online e-mail help has not responded in the promised 48 hours,(4+ days, no contact) and online chat person did not understand simple English - he kept asking whether I have a CD (I bought it at an office supply store), and he told me I have the option to install a state of my choice. He escalated the help request to a higher level, but they never got back to me.Also, this does not let you preview your tax return before you print. You can only preview your entries, which I don't like.I returned by product to the store for a refund, and bought the Federal-only standard version [...]. So I saved [...]and can use the [...] e-file form on the Illinois.gov website for my much simpler state return."
2,Don't make a mistake,"It's almost impossible to go back and correct an error, which makes the program very frustrating. I would have been better off doing it the old-fashioned way - a paper return. I don't understand why these programs have to be so limiting when it comes to corrections."
2,Very Lacking,"This program doesn't break down the deductions and credits very well. You don't know what exactly to put in what deduction or credit. Turbo Tax has it though, turbo tax is about 20 times easier to use."
1,Their installer and support is the worst!,"I wasted an hour of time this morning. I spent 30 minutes trying to install it, another 30 minutes on hold (never did get through). Finally saw the reviews here, and got it to install using safe-mode.I would try and get a refund, but I'm sure I'd end up on hold for another 1/2 hour."
2,2005 Taxcut Deluxe,"I have wasted over a week on the K-1 worksheet as Taxcut substituted it for the regular schedule K-1. Companies sent out directions on where to make entries on the regular K-1 but you have to put the data into the worksheet which uses different terminology. This is a major problem with this year's Taxcut. The email address that tech support gave me to get a refund didn't work. I would advise against Taxcut if you have any schedule K's to do. It does import from Microsoft Money 2006, and Taxcut 2004 ok."
2,Glaring problems and idiotic customer support,"I purchased TaxCut Premium this year. Big mistake. I encountered two problems with the Schedule C. First, I found that two different business types had the same Principal Business codes. Second, and truly egregious, is that the interview process for the Schedule C (for a sole proprietorship) neglected to ask about Cost of Goods Sold!!! For a retailer this is generally the largest expense! The Final Review feature didn't even provide a warning that these fields were blank on the Schedule C. It's easy enough to get around, going directly to the form, but when I contacted customer support to alert them to these problems they gave stupid answers like ""delete the form and then go through the process again."" Huh? Ridiculous."
3,Updates have been a problem,"I have been using TaxCut for years and will continue to do so. However, this year I'm have problems with downloading the updates. I think it's related to my new Macafe Firewall I'm using. I haven't been able to get the updates even while the firewall is shut off.I've gotten around the issue by downloading the self extracting executable from TaxCut. Once I download and run this file the update is complete."
3,Frustration,"The Federal portion of this software worked great. However, there was a glitch in the Virginia portion that refused to go away. The problem returned every time I up-dated, and I could not file without up-dadting. The problem resulted in a difference of more than $1000 in my state tax, so I finally purchased Tax Act, and it breezed through both the Federal and the State with no problem, and with the correct amount of tax. Needless to say, I wish I had purchased Tax Act originally."
3,Not TurboTax,If you're looking for something comparable to TurboTax this is it but rest assured it is definitely not TurboTax. TT is a little more polished application with better reports. The only reason I used TaxCut is because I got ticked off at TurboTax for not offering the free filing rebate. Maybe they will change for 2007.
1,Immature Software,"This software is years behind TurboTax, which I've used for the 4 years prior (with no audits and no problems). I gave it a shot this time around because it was cheaper, but found numerous bugs that have left me very nervous about submitting my taxes. Here's a HUGE one: If you live in California, you can deduct a portion of your vehicle registration fees under state and local tax. Turbotax explicitly asks you for this. Taxcut MAKES NO MENTION OF IT. If you didn't know to enter it manually (how ridiculous!), you wouldn't get this credit. And for most people, this credit will reduce their taxes (or increase their rebate) significantly-- for me it was far more than the cost of this stupid software.If you want to be wary about your taxes, use Taxcut. If you want to miss obvious deductions and credits, use Taxcut."
2,Limited Options,"Unfortunately most of us are stuck with either TurboTax or TaxCut! I switched to TaxCut this year from TurboTax. Last year I had to boot up in safe mode to install AND run TurboTax. So I thought I'd give TaxCut a try this year. Low and behold I got the dreaded 21% hang while trying to load the mmvdpro.swf file. I had to boot up into safe mode again this year to install TaxCut. However, I was able to run TaxCut from normal boot, so a little improvement.Once installed TaxCut imported my TurboTax file and everything seemed to work smoothly. As TurboTax did last year. I'm not sure what these companies are doing with their software builds as the Tax software are the only programs I have installation problems with.Now, I just have to wait until I get the latest TaxCut updates (due in mid Feb) to submit my return.p.s. I'm using Premium +State"
2,Form 8801,"After four straight years of using TaxCut, I believe I'll use TurboTax next year. As others pointed out, after TaxCut indicated no further errors nor warnings, the return got rejected by the IRS because, in Form 8801, the program did not subtract line 38 from line 37 and put the results in line 40. I won't be able to e-file because of this basic mistake in TaxCut's compliance with how the form should be filled out according to the IRS."
1,State s/w won't install and tech support is non-existent,"Like many others, I bought TaxCut Deluxe + State on CD and Taxcut told me ""If you purchased a state program, please copy and paste the Install Key and Name from the confirmation e-mail"" when I tried to install and activate the state software.Well, there is no e-mail and no key. Apparently, Taxcut assumes that I downloaded Taxcut from the Web site, instead of from a CD.I tried to email H&R; Block and also tried their online chat. No luck.Their Web site touts ""24 hour response time"" for e-mail, but it has been three days now, and I haven't gotten a reply.When I tried their chat support, it kept saying that an agent would be with me shortly, but after 30-40 minutes of this it declared that it was terminating my chat session.After being a satisfied Taxcut customer for several years, H&R; Block has converted me into a permanent H&R; Block NON-customer.I returned the software and bought TurboTax."
2,State Problem Is With XP,"I have been having the same problem with the TaxCut state return as many of the other reviewers. I noticed that most of them say ""on my Windows XP machine"". So, I tried the software on an old Windows ME machine, and IT WORKED! The state part did not ask for an install key. Seems like TaxCut should be able to figure this out. Back to TurboTax next year."
1,TaxCut FAILED miserably this year,"I've used this product for the last 3 years with no problems however this year has been a nightmare.When attemptin to open the state return I receive a ""Key not Valid"" despite I purchased a state included product.Many hours on the phone to support resulted in a ""return to store"" request for a free exchange. This did not solve the issue either. After more hour on the phone the company sent a replacement CD insuring me this would solve the problem.Same thing. I am an IT person and my new DELL is not the problem. Looks like its TurboTax for me from here on out."
3,Vital Feature missing this year,"This year's version of TaxCut omitted the feature to download 1099 information from financial institutions. This used to save me a lot of effort - but this year it's missing, and no explanation has been given.Every year I end up regretting paying for this (there's always something that doesn't work the way you expect or need it to)."
1,No Mac version,"I've used TaxCut on a Mac for the past four years. This year, I was pleasantly surprised when an unordered TaxCut CD arrived in the mail. How nice! I didn't have to order it from Amazon and wait for it to arrive.Now, I'm a procrastinator, so today, April 9th, I opened up the package. And found --- a Windows-only CD. Grrrrr. OK, so I'm annoyed, but I go to the website to purchase and download the Mac verson. Only --- no Mac version at all this year!!But, judging from some of the reviews below, maybe I'm lucky to be forced to use TurboTax."
4,mmvdpro.swf problem,"I ran into the same problem with the mmvdpro.swf file at 21 %. I rebooted the machine into Safe Mode with Networking, installed it and it worked! Hope this helps."
1,Won't install,"Like another reviewer, I am also unable to install this product. The installation freezes at 21% while installing mmvdpro.swf."
2,Beware - No ability to import 1099 data electroncially,"I've been a Tax Cut user for number of years. This is the first time I'll be returning the product back for one simple reason. This year's (2005) version does not include the feature to import 1099-Div and 1099-B (stocks and mutual fund related capital gains and losses) information directly from your Financial service provider. If you have significant amount of investment related activity in 2005, you will have enter all of them manually. Based on my research, Turbo Tax has the feature to import this information electronically. If this feature is not important to you, then I would heartily recommend this product for its ease of use and better price value (CD version) than Turbo Tax."
4,Ordering early doesn't pay.,"I love this product and use it every year. This year however, I finished my return Feb2 but when I went to file, the program said I had to wait until mid-february to download the latest update. I could not file without the update and had to wait 2 additional weeks to file."
2,"Support terrible, only works on new installs","[...] We have used Tax Cuts for years, but this year they have changed the way they bundle state and federal together. When you try to install Tax Cuts 05 on a computer that has the previous years installed on it you get a ""Install Key Not Valid"" message when you try to run the state program.I installed it on a PC that never had Tax Cuts on it and it works just fine. I even bought a second copy from the Internet web site (first copy bought at Office Max) and had the exact same problem.As already mention the Technical Support is horrible and I have been bounced around in queues for about 3 hours.Going to try for a return if my current call (on hold yet again) doesn't work. Time to go for Turbo Tax I guess."
1,Pathetic,"I've been a loyal and satisfied user of TaxCut for many years. This year is a far different story! Believe it or not, there seems to be no place in the interviews, forms or worksheets to enter my quartely estimated tax payments made to the state of CA for 2005!! According to the actual forms this info is supposed to come from the CA ""Background Worksheet"" which seems to have absolutely no place to enter it. I called tech support several times in the hope of getting a knowledgeable person to help. Wasted a lot of time trying various things for them to no avail. My software is also up-to-date. I find it quite hard to believe that this is impossible to do. Even it it were possible I find is hard to believe it is so difficult to do because I'm very computer literate myself and CA is perhaps the most important state for taxation! I'm sending it back for their Money Back Guarantee ($25 at most) but its not going to compensate for my time lost."
4,Tax Help,It is a good product. Easy to use with clear instructions. I have used TaxCut for the last three years.
2,Never leave TurboTax again!!!,"I used TurboTax Deluxe last year, and had efficient results. Trying to save money this year, I went with TaxCut. Big Mistake, there were big holes in the tax questions that would have led me to miss big deductions. It didn't handle my Health Savings Account, Vehicle Registration deduction, and the Sales Tax deduction for Washington state. I got frustrated at the problems, and went back to the store and bought TurboTax. It handled everything I needed and was much easier to use. I'll be a loyal TurboTax user from now on."
3,Required forms are not yet available,"I have used Tax Cut for the past few years and never had a problem before now.Everything was going fine until I hit the review button and the system found an error. When I clicked on ""Fix"" the message said that I needed to file Alternative Minimum Tax form, but that the form would not be ready until mid-February. I'm stuck because the system won't let me complete the return until the form is complete. The form is listed on the box as one of the forms ""you're likely to need.""By the way, some of my friends had major problems with Turbo Tax last year."
4,tax cut 2005+state,"NOT PERFECT, BUT FAR BETTER THAN ""TURBOTAX"". I HAD TO DOWNLOAD THE ""UPGRADES"" TO GET IT TO WORK. IT IS FAIRLY SIMPLE TO USE AND IT DID MY ""K-1"" INVESTMENT STUFF EXCEPT THAT IT LEFT OUT 2 (SIMPLE) 'REQUIRED FEDERAL FORMS (WHICH I DID BY HAND). THE STATE (MINN) PART WAS OK, EXCEPT I COULD NOT GET IT TO DEDUCT MY INTEREST FROM INCOME FROM US TREASURY BOND FUNDS. (NOT TAXABLE IN MANY STATES).THE MINN FORM IS SIMPLE AND I COMPLETED IT MANUALLY.NOTE: TO DOWNLOAD THE UPGRADES I HAD TO ""DISABLE"" MY NORTON FIREWALL."
5,The best movie I have ever seen,This is the most touching movie I have ever seen. It will make you see things about love and life that you never have before. I must say it is my all-time favorite movie. I hope you enjoy it and treasure it for a lifetime.
3,flower power rocks!,"fascinating as a period piece, this flower power era view of a young blind man struggling to make a life of his own still scores. eileen heckart deserved her oscar as an overprotective mom, and goldie hawn was enough to make this queer boy convert, but edward albert, despite a lovely body, is wooden in the lead. nothing special, but still fun."
1,Couldn't watch it all - irritatíngly cute,"I couldn't take too much of this film - when the blind fellow began to play the guitar, that was it for me.The actress who played the mother won an Oscar for her performance, so I should have another look at the film the next timeit's on Turner Classic Movies. But buy it? No way. I erased it after seeing about 40 minutes of it. I agree with theother one star review."
5,A BEAUTIFUL FILM....,"I watched Butterflies are Free on cable for the first time this past weekend. How did I ever miss this one! It was a very good story, and I thought the acting all around was outstanding. It's the story of a blind man, who is determined to make it on his own, much to the chagrin of his mother, who is portrayed brilliantly by Eileen Heckart. She won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress for her work here. And along with trying to be independent, he meets a woman who helps to bring him out into the world, and discover new things. Now I knew from the start that Goldie Hawn's character wasn't going to be completely sympathetic, but I guess you just have to see the movie to figure that out. The movie had me hook, line, and sinker. and I was glued to my couch for the whole thing. I really enjoyed this film, and recommend it."
3,"Mick, a bit too quick","This book by Mickey Rivers is truly unique. It reads more like a loosely connected bunch of stories somewhat covering his life and career. Mickey breaks the rules of proper grammar in favor of telling a story in his own words.The book is interesting, but lacking in any real depth. You can probably read it quickly in one setting, but I would rather have a meatier book from one of the true characters of the game, a man who spent time on one of the craziest and greatest baseball teams ever."
3,Interesting account of an appalling man,"Grogan was the classic empire-building type - arrogant, brave, ruthless and autocratic. Like Colonel Dyer, who won notoriety at Amritsar, Grogan believed in the 'iron fist', the 'strong arm' of the law and the other eupehmisms for the ruthless application of overwhelming force against all those who dared to differ from his ideas of the supreme value of the British Empire.Yet even today some reactionaries, like Edward Paice himself, Niall Ferguson and Lawrence James, are swollen with hero-worship of these appalling thugs, and creeps like Blair and Brown tell us that we should admire the Empire.Books like this actually tell us quite a lot about why the Empire has gone and show us what a good thing it is that it has gone!"
4,perfect new baby gift,This lovely poem by Eugene Field is a fondly remembered favorite from my own childhood. The magical illustrations of this version make it a perfect gift when friends have babies or (now) grandbabies!
1,Sorry boys,"I hate to say it. I guess I'm showing my age, but I prefer the Dad's work (Jimmy Webb). Of course, some of his early recordings didn't reflect his absolute talent, so I'll keep looking."
3,"Love the Series, but not for $130 a season.","I am a huge FarScape fan and in gearing up for the mini-series that's going to tie up the story arc that the Sci-Fi channel left hanging after season 4, I was going to come and buy all 4 seasons of the show to refresh my memory.Imagine my surprise when I saw the price tags (not to mention that season 3 and 4 aren't available in boxed sets yet).It was just a TV show (regardless of how awesome it was), and you can still see repeats on Sci-Fi, granted it's not always at convenient times. It's definately not worth $130 a season, especially with what I'm hearing about the special features being lacking.I bought the first DVD from the first season and color me unimpressed. I'm sure Amazon is pricing based on manufacturer's suggestion - but yeesh, ADV, cut the fans a break. Not all sci-fi fans/geeks have a multibillion dollar corporation that they started out of their garage!"
4,Great show but....,...the main character is such a mouth-breather. It is very annoying! I personally cannot stand to watch someone who has their mouth open all the time. I am just hoping a fly will fly into his mouth and he will finally shut it! Otherwise it is a great show!
3,"Is this the same series? characters look the same, but","I'm up to Disk 3 and I'm missing the quality of Season one, it's sense of humour and warmth of camaraderie.And it's dark. Literally. The Lighting Union on strike?It was almost funny when John and Rigel were biting each other.Tis the Season of Scorpius."
1,How did this show last 4 SEASONS?,This is an amazingly stupid show written for people who thinkmutant x is intelligent entertainment. How in the world did this awful hunk of @$#^ get on the television. Astoundingly stupid. ZERO STARS
2,did not receive whole season,what was there was okay but only received 2 disc not six as stated in add. Don't know where the other 4 disc went
3,Season 2 is not the best.,I said it was ok but most of the episodes I fast forward to end them sooner. The first season was much better.
2,"Love the show, hate the DVD production.","As a loyal SciFi fan, I believe Farscape to be among the best and the most imaginative shows to ever grace the screen and would give it 6 stars if I could. But the production of DVDs by ADV films of which I own both Farscape seasons, Andromeda & Beastmaster, leaves much to be desired (as usual). They are slow to release the shows in box set so they can milk the individual sets. The transfer is at times terrible. The packaging is as cheap as they come (compare that to Babylon5, Hercules, Xena or even Stargate's packaging and you'll see what I'm talking about.) No extras to speak of. And they want way too much for the individual DVDs and the box sets. I for one will not waste any more money on ADV film's slow, half hearted and less than adequate productions."
4,"Excellent make up, story line a bit sappy for me","Sometimes this series gets a little too sappy or melodramatic for me, but it is one of my husband's favorites. So I watch it with him just like he watches The Big Bang Theory reruns with me over and over and over ... true love!I'm a Star Trek fan, and this series is just too silly and far fetched even for me. But it has some comic relief so that makes it OK to watch. But the character make up - it is SPECTACULAR! And the master puppetry is virtually invisible. It's hard to tell who's the live actor and who's the puppet. For the fabulous make up alone I give it 4 stars. My husband would give it 10 if he could."
5,hilarious,"okay, seriously. this episode is amazing, especially if you've been watching the show for a while. rygel makes an unexpected appearance and if that doesn't just make this episode 5-star-worthy, i don't know what will. ben browder showcases his acting chops, which, up to this point, i wasn't convinced he had. all in all a great episode."
4,Great series but 'extras' are pathetic,"Everyone knows that the series is great, so I won't belabor that point. The first season collection had some great extras--I especially liked the Ben Browder/Claudia Black commentaries. This collection has only one commentary episode, and it was done by two technical people - no actors. The rest of the extras feature typed-up synopses of the actors' careers, not actual interviews, and the ever-present 'conceptual drawings'. Not even a screen-saver!"
5,Superb,"The second season of Farscape is one of the best with some of my favorite episodes. These include Die Me Dichotomy, Liars Guns and Money, Won't Get Fooled Again and Look at the Princess. Although I liked nearly every episode of the second season, these were the best. One of the things that made season 2 so great was the introduction of the scarrans. They are some of the most fascinating and intriguing races on the show. The only ones that come close are the nebari and the ancients and I am not sure even they compare.Watch this show and enjoy the incredible thrill ride."
1,you have to love techno to appreciate this mess,"THEY TRICKED ME INTO BUYING THIS ONE!! I AM A LONG TIME MIKE OLDFIELD FAN AND HAVE JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING HE HAS EVER RELEASED,BUT THIS IS NOTHING LIKE I EXPECTED AFTER READING THE REVIEWS OF THESE OTHER PEOPLE. THIS IS REPETITIVE,MONOTENOUS, BEBOPPYTECHNO GARBAGE!! SO IF YOUR LOOKING FOR THE TRADITIONAL MASTERPIECES THAT MIKE HAS RELEASED THROUGH OUT THE YEARS, DONT BUY THIS ONE!!"
5,"Great Colors,",Perfect in size and color. Had read complaints on another brand but these are perfect for Mexican railroad. All ages can play and see the color difference even if they can not count all the dots
2,Double 15 dominoes,"Somewhat disappointed with Puremeco 15-dot domino set. Having played with 12-dot sets up to now, would prefer having 15-set the same colors as 12-set for the first 12 numbers, then different colors for the additional 13, 14, and 15's. Colors are not as distinctive as I'd prefer. I would have returned this set except one cannot judge the colors without opening the set, and Amazon does not allow return of opened merchandise - a ""gotcha""."
2,deceived,I have been looking for thick dominoes that will stand up better making them easier to play with. These were advertised to be thicker than they are. I was very dissatisfied whth them so i returned them.
1,Environmental ripoff,Any money spent purchasing this is a total waste. After obtaining it I was fortunate enough to find out more about Ms. Bari at several websites which I highly recommend to the readers of these reviews. <www.theava.com> is the site of Bari's former publisher and has a wealth of information about her environmental hustles. Even more can be found at <www.sonomacountyfreepress.com>
4,A pleasure to read,"Len Deighton produces some of the most enjoyable non-fiction books on World War II that I have read. His experience as a fiction writer gives him the skill that so many historians lack, tha ability to tell a story. The Battle of Britain is a perfect combination of politics, men, technology and tactics."
2,Technical analysis,"Don't expect great human dramar or neck-twisting fighter combats here. This is a technical analysis of the Battle of Britain, done with skill by Mr. Deighton."
5,Parsons family history,"This book has enabled me to fill in a lot of my ancestry that I didn't have before. My grandmom had the book when I was growing up but it got lost somewhere and I thought I would never find it. Great book, has a lot of interesting stories and pictures of some of my ancesters."
5,Great film making,"This is one of the last musicals that did well. It's a comedy that will have you roaring out loud and totally entertain you. If you're narrow minded you may not like the subplot but if you're open minded it's a very funny movie that I'm sure will be a favorite for years to come. Get this and enjoy it, it's really that good. Doen't be hating"
5,JULIE ANDREWS! A LEGEND!,"I remember sitting through it in 1983 in the theatre with Mama and Grandmother. We all LOVED it. With Poppins, Maria and Gertrude; Julie`s Victor/Victoria is HER BEST effort on celluloid. Leslie Ann-Warren, James Garner, Robert Preston, Blake Edwards, Henry Mancini & Leslie Bricusse ALL excell in this comedy. It may be a trifle long and the Hercule Poirot-imitation unnecessary; but it really is the last of the GREAT MGM MUSICALS(although it was shot i England, released by MGM). The set-designs are a treasure 2 behold."
5,"It's simply Smart, Sexy and Delicious to Watch! A Gem","Victor/Victoria is really Julie Andrews (Besides the Sound of Music) at her best. She is Sexy, brilliant as Victoria and as Victor, a true notibility, acted with poised and grace. She is truly awesome in both roles. It is a movie that can be viewed over and over and never get dulled. It is full of laughter (humor) and it's truly romantic. She is of course, a true example of a person who is graceful, feminine and natural. Yes, I'm a fan, however, this movie I highly recommend to anyone who enjoys, sheer fun, humor, comedy and musicals."
4,Victor Victoria,Excelent. I feel very satifaied for the good service that you provide I recived the dvd soonner than I expected and I glad to have this movie in my colection because is very dificult to find it.
4,Victor/Victoria,"Classic musical comedy, Julie Andrews is not only a great singer but shes easy on the eyes. This is a classic boy meets girl, then thinks hes gay when he starts falling in love for the girl pretending to be a gay guy. A funny movie that was a head of its time. another keeper for your collection"
5,"correction to ""quotes and trivia""","The ""correct error"" function on the Amazon site does not give me any way to do this, so I'm putting it in a review. On the left of the page under ""Explore this DVD,"" I clicked on ""quotes & trivia,"" and found the amazing MISinformation below about the opera Madame Butterfly: ""The opera, attended by King and Victoria, is Puccini's ""Madamea Butterfly"" which is, fittingly, about a man masquerading as a woman."" There is NO ""man masquerading as a woman"" in Puccini's opera; I think the writer has confused the opera with the play about REAL PEOPLE with a similar title.I have seen Julie Andrews say in an interview that her husband chose Madame Butterfly for that scene knowing that it always makes her cry, and that she cried that day for a LONG time, effortlessly, as they worked on the scene."
5,Victor/Victoria,"This is one of my favorite movies. I wore my old one out, watching it. I couldn't find it at flea markets or used video sales. I thought I'd try Amazon.com. What a great experience.I received the video in 3 days and at such a fabulous price.I shall return!Thank you,Kay D"
3,Gimmick Flick Stolen By A Floozy Played To The Hilt,"Make no mistake, Victor Victoria was the Leslie Ann Warren show. Her unforgettable role of airhead slut stole the film so much that I only watch this movie to fast forward to her scenes and sequences like a fan voyeur. Never has such a part been played with as much raw sexuality or erotic charisma. As far as I'm concerned, she should have won the Oscar."
2,Unconvincing,"With a singular exception, nothing in this movie convinced me. With the exception of Preston's room and dialog at the beginning of the movie, which originally raised my hopes, the sets looked fake. The acting seemed fake as either over the top or flying under the radar. The dialog was highly contrived and strained. The plot's chain of events seemed forced. Try as I might, including closing my eyes just to listen only, Andrews never convinced me that anyone would confuse her for a man. And that is a big problem when the plot of the movie hinges on it. The other actors in the film all wondered how Garner figured out that Victor was actually a Victoria. I wondered how anyone could conclude otherwise.I agree with reviewer J.C. Clarke about Preston's final scene. I felt embarrassed for him. I know it's a comedy, but ... give me something to laugh at, not something tiresome and clunky.I gave it 2 stars because it was a clever idea, no matter how poorly done."
2,Ugh,"Not that funny, although there were a few decent gags here and there (the travails of the French waiter come to mind) but the rest of it is disappointing. The musical numbers didn't even do Julie Andrews' voice justice as far as I am concerned. I watched it out of curiousity but don't see myself watching it again."
4,Andrews`third miracle film,"This is the last original musical of importance (and it was from the musical studio MGM) and it showed Julie Andrews in sparkling form. Here her voice was at her mature best and the production itself was a vellcrafted love-letter from her husband Blake Edwards and composer Henry Mancini. It was her third Oscar-nomination as Best Actress(Oscar), but lost to Meryl Streep`s ""Sophie`s Choice"". Julie however won for her very first film, ""Mary Poppins"". In the mid-90`s Julie Andrews enjoyed a huge Broadway success with a musical adaption of this film. Robert Preston and Lesley Ann Warren also great."
4,Maria-Julie was simply great!,"Hmm, I was a bit hesitant at first on whether I should watch this show because my image of Julie is still the bubbly Mary and Maria in her earlier roles. However, after seeing it, I was even more attracted to her voice and acting. For those who dislike this film, try seeing it again and you might just fall in love with it. I really like the part when Victoria(Julie) hit a high note and broke the glasses. Simply great performance put up by all the cast!"
5,Funny,"One of the best movies I've seen. The cast works perfectly together and the subject matter is spot on. For a bunch of non-gay actors, the played it very well."
3,Mostly psychological,"This was an interesting read: I expected a war story, something that took characters from the beginning, trained them, threw them into combat, and showed the evolution therein, much like The Cruel Sea. Instead, I got a book about criminal minds, psychological testing, team-building, tons of flash-backs, and a minuscule afterthought of war.When I reached page 450 (of about 550) and the group was STILL training, I realized this was a book more about developing a group of characters from un-usable and despicable to redeemable, almost a commentary on how prisoners can be saved. While I enjoyed reading the book on trips or during some downtime, it was frustrating how slowly the story moved due to random sets of flash-backs that the author includes. The final chapter does read well, and its non-standard format is a good way to end the book.I have not seen the movie but from reading a wikipedia summary, it seems quite a bit different."
5,"Madame Bovary, French Edition","A fat book that easily goes everywhere on Kindle. In combination with Dictionaire francais de definitions (definitions are also in French), which defines any word to the right of the cursor and which installs free, reading in French is streamlined for those who otherwise must pause to look up words. The Kindle is the perfect medium for anyone fluent but less than native in a foreign language. And in this case, Flaubert shines in his own French, whereas he plods along in translation. The descriptive passages become a pleasure instead of a drag."
4,good,"Very nice converts. Exact in size and from 100 only one was damaged. But, they are a bit asymmetric and different in shape."
3,Decent solo album,"I've always been a fan of Tony Mills since the Shy days. This cd has a few really good catchy tunes, that'sabout it."
2,Not yet ready - poor picture quality,"Very easy to use. Easy to load pictures. Unfortunately the screen quality was very grainy and difficult to look at. Returned the item. Sony frames I've seen seemed much better, although at a significantly higher price. Still this frame is not worth the money. Also, be aware that the viewing size is much smaller than 5x7."
2,welllll......,"viewing angle is terrible. If you're not directly in front of it, you can't see the pictures. But it was the thought that counts, right?"
3,Pacific Digital Photo Frame,"Am a bit disappointed with this product. The clear digital photos that are loaded onto the unit become blurry for viewing. The photo frame is also advertised as a 5 x 7, which is deceiving - the photos only view through a 3 x 4 inch window."
2,Not Really 8x10,"Two problems with this photo frame.1. It is NOT 8x10 as advertised. The frame is 8x10 matted down to a screen that is 6x8. It's resolution at 600x800 is an odd ratio that will require re-cropping all of your images.2. The software is NOT VISTA compatible and there are no updates or patches on the manufacturers website.If you can live with the above, it's nice. I could not get it to import pictures from my flash drive (USB) but I admittedly didn't try very long. I had to transfere the pic's to an older XP machine from my Vista machine, then to the frame."
1,Abysmal,"Product worked for about 30 minutes out of the box. Tried their Customer Support, was routed through voice mail for days. Returned the product finally, next one was DOA. Don't bother."
