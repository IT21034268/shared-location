5,Townsend Center Review Staff,"Download this Occasional Paper for FREE at [...]The Novel in Africa is the text of November 1998's Una's Lecture, delivered by South African novelist J.M. Coetzee. While a Coetzee text, one critic notes, ""typically produces irritation or discomfort,"" The Novel in Africa produces surprise as well: the lecture is embedded in a fiction, and functions as both a lecture and a segment in a short story."
2,Of Very Limited Usefulness,"I think the focus on transference vis a vis BPD is a good one, as the disorder involves a lot of interpersonal/attachment problems. But much of the book is somewhat presumptuous, based on things not measurable or seen. I also found some of the examples to reinforce negative stereotypes about the borderline patient's anger, which simply do not jibe with a lot of clinical experience that is more nuanced and subtle.Also, the insistence that anger simply equates the ""abuser role"" and other shortcuts that the authors use belie the complexity of not just these patients' emotions, but anyone's!"
4,Could be better,"This is a pretty good comp, but it could be a lot better. For one the sellouts(bosstones) shouldn't be on it. A lot of good bands from the warped tour were left out, and this was meant to capture the essence of the tour. It didn't."
1,Mala Fe album,"As much as I love Merengue and Mala fe's music, This album sucked. I would have rather spent the money on trash bags."
4,Being Saved is More than What some Think,"""[Abraham]'s faith and his actions worked together;his faith was made perfect through his actions.""This is what saved Abraham, and this is what Catholics really believe.Sungenis shows that a person can't work his way to heaven-we aren't employees of the Jesus Christ Corporation. He also notes that the only time in the Bible that the words ""faith"" and ""alone"" are only put together in James 2:24. This is when James writes that we are not saved by faith alone. It would be good to read James 2:14-24 about this.But more importantly, Sungenis shows that being saved is a process. Even when we accept Christ in our lives, that doesn't mean good works spontaneously flow out of us. Earlier in Ch. 2, James sets of a poor and a rich man attending the same Christian meeting. The temptation is to adore the rich and ignore the poor. And this often happens. Instead, we must stand guard, even with our faith, to resist doing evil."
1,What dream world does the author live in?,"Paley must have been one of those kindergarten teachers who were off humming to themselves while her students were beating the tar out of their unfortunate ""playmates."" Children are not sweet little angels, most of them are utter horrors who have to be taught to be good and kind-sometimes it works, sometimes not. Paley's rose-tinted view of childhood, straight out of Little Lord Fauntleroy and Pollyanna, reads as amusing fiction for one who suffered at the hands of her ""kind"" schoolmates."
2,Worst Cybermen story ever,"Returning to Nerva Beacon from Skaro (in 'Genesis of the Daleks') to rejoin the TARDIS, the Doctor, Sarah and Harry arrive some 1000 years earlier than when they left. Nerva Beacon is still in its original function, a space beacon advising approaching ships of a new asteroid, Voga, that is not reordered on all star charts.But all is not well: a mysterious plague is striking down the crew and the exographer who is surveying Voga is acting suspiciously. And lurking out in space are the Cybermen...The first appearance of the Cybermen in 7 years, and sadly a very poor story. In the broad, the story sounds fine, but (as the saying goes) the devil is in the detail. Poor motivation, the most emotional non-emotional cyborgs, and an unlikely method of disposing of them add up to make this story quite dreadful.How bad is it? It was another 7 years before the Cybermen returned..."
3,Harry Sullivan is an 'idiot'?????,"The Doctor, Sarah and Harry arrive back on the ark (from the Ark in Space) only to find they have arrived 1000 years too early. They encounter an ark full of dead bodies and soon find themselves caught up in a Cyberman plot to destroy the 'planet of gold', Voga.Being an adaptation of the serial, the book is exactly the same. Two annoying inconsistencies are the Cybermen using guns in the book whereas the tv serial had their guns inbuilt into their heads and the other is the portrayal of the Cybermats as the small silverfish looking Cyber killers (as seen in The Wheel In Space and Tomb of the Cybermen), whereas in the serial they look like metal eels.I would recommend watching the video rather than reading this book, you will get more out of it."
4,Guitarists and Bassists,"If you are a guitarist or bassist with little or no music theory background, put this book on your shopping/wish list. This book is a very easy and fairly entertaining read. You will definitely come away with a firm foundation in music theory. No, this book isn't an 'everything you need to know' type of book, but for the six and four stringed instrumentalist, it is quite close. The included CD is quite useful and supplements the book quite well. For the price you are getting a great deal."
5,childhood,"This is a wonderful cd, I listened to it constantly when I was little and was on top of the world when at the age of nine I got to see Taj Mahal in concert. This cd made me appreaciate blues and now I love all of his new stuff as well. This cd is enjoyable for kids but as a college student I still listen to it."
5,We read it over and over again.,"At age three I started reading Brave Irene to my daughter. She is now nine years old and it remains her all time favorite book. Back then we would read it at least tree times a week or more. Still, Now every once in awhile, Annie comes to me and says "" can we read Brave Irene together"". The story is about a young girl Irene who seems to be maybe nine or ten years old. Her mother is a dressmaker and has made a gown for the dutches for her ball.Unfortunatley her mother isn't feeling to well and can't get the gown to dutches in time for the ball.Irene being a very responsible, carring, and BRAVE child,Wants to help her mom. So she takes the gown to the dutches. She has some problems along the way, But because of her love for her mother, she is determined to get the job done. I feel that there are many lessons this book can teach a child. The main one being,CARRING. Our first copy of this book is so worn out, I recently bought a new one.."
4,Great blend of girlie interests with,"I love this story, with it's blending of topics that fascinate my 3-year-old girl (beautiful dresses and balls) with a portrayal of a strong, brave, determined girl. I do think I liked it better than my daughter did, though -- she was distressed by Irene's journey, and I'm not sure if it was because it's a bit scary or because Irene (temporarily) loses the beautiful dress."
4,KS Bookie,"Brave Irene illustrates that a little girl can be courageous and steadfast. The story is full of innovative language that will broaden the young reader's vocabulary, without becoming distracting. Irene is a caring young girl who loves her mother dearly. Irene must deliver a dress her mother has made for the duchess. She takes her responsibility seriously, battling wind and snow to finish her task. In the end, Irene is rewarded for her integrity. It is a modern and heartwarming fairytale!"
2,Brave Irene,My six year old son found this story too long and dull. Although the message is good it didn't hold his attention.
1,worst soup ever,this was so bad that i threw it away in front of my co-workers. Make your own soup! This is awful!!!
1,smells of ham only after you add water,"Some of us are vegetarian, maybe for health, maybe out of a desire to be less stressful on the environment and help preserve fish diversity in the seas. Still others have inhibitions from possibly misguided handed-down religious beliefs against ingesting animal products, including notably pig, which happens to be my Chinese birth sign. Discovering this unlisted ingredient seems like a deliberate attempt to undermine my freedom of choice. I will find it hard to ever want to try this manufacturer again."
3,Decent soup,Decent soup. Good deal if it's on sale. It is a little salty but not too much. Good for the office or on the go.
4,tasty lunch!,I have always been a fan of pea soup- love the taste and the fact that it's easy to prepare. Recently I had this product delivered to my work so I can have it on hand anytime hunger strikes!! great lunch option if you're on a budget.
2,Fine performances undermined by bad sonics,"I strongly disagree with the first reviewer who claimed this recording gave him a ""being there"" experience unless ""there"" is a high school gymnasium. This recording is bright to the point of irritation. Soft sections sound fine, but when forte arrives, dive for the volume control and reduce it. Detail is lacking in loud sections, a characteristic of several other SACDs I've heard (but never from Telarc). Also, when the orchestra is playing at all loudly, the soloists tend to recede within the wall of sound.P.S. This is an SACD-only recording. Why Sony keeps duel inventory is beyond me. Hyrbid is not just for the Prius, Sony."
5,What an amazing artist. He will go far,"Billy's voice is absolutely breathtaking and to take us into his personal life with his hit ""Walk A Little Straighter"" is just so touching. His voice is beautiful. The song rips on your heat strings while that voice is so soothing. I am proud to say I am a fan of Billys and cant wait to see him in conceret."
5,BILLY CURRINGTONS CD,I LOVE BILLY'S CD IT IS SO GOOD I LOVE THE SONG WALK A LITTLE STRAIGHTER HE HAS SUCH A WONDERFUL VOICE I LOVE ITHE IS REALLY GOOD!!!!!!!!
2,Great CD!!,If you haven't gotten Billy Currington's CD YOU NEED TO!!I love this whole CDThis artist will go far in his career.The song Walk a little straighter is one of my Favorites!!
5,Billy is the best,I love Billy Currington's CD. it the best cd i own and my favorite by far. he did a wonderful job and i'm so glad i bought this cd.
5,Walk A Little Straighter Touched The Inside Of My Heart!!!,"I am 37 years old and have purchased alot of music in my life. I saw Alabama in concert in 1984 and they were the best, now they are retiring from touring. I have been touched by alot of music but never like Billy's music has touched me ""Walk A Little Straighter"" is the truest song I have ever heard. Not proud to say but my dad was a alocholic and I lost him at an early age of 51. I was having a hard time getting through this until I bought this cd. Ever song on this cd should be a #1 hit and you know you don't buy many cd's that you like ever song on it. Enough said everyone should own a copy. That is my opinion and I am like Billy fishing is fun even if you don't get a bite.Just a Mississippi Southern girl."
5,Fine Country Music,"This is the best debut album I have ever owned. I love every song on it and never tire of listening to them day after day. I think Billy is an excellent artist, writer and performer - just what country music has been needing for a very long time now. I think he has a long and prosperous career ahead of him and I intend to do all I can to help him out in it. BUY this CD - you won't regret it.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Billy is the best!,"Billy Currington is definitely one of the hottest artists to hit the country scene recently! His hit ""Walk a Little Straighter"" is definitely a perfect reflection of the rest of this album! I definitely recommend it! :)"
1,Slow!,I paid a lot extra for one-day shipping...and five days later it's still not here! I expect a refund on shipping.
1,Don't waste your money... and time!,"We bought this last December thinking it was an answer to easy litter cleaning. We religiously cleaned the box as well as surrounding areas frequently, according to the directions. Due to the fact that there are SO many parts, this became more time consuming than just sifting from a 'less technical' litter box. It worked well... for about a week. The motor was too slow/underpowered, so it would get caught in the middle of the box during sifting. After about two months, we had to prop up one side in order to get the sifter to go through the litter completely without getting caught. Unfortunately the sifter gets pushed up, so dirty clumps get caught on the bottom. FINALLY about three weeks ago, our Purrforma stopped working altogether, only 8 months after the original purchase. What a waste of $250."
2,A Good Concept But Out-of-Date,"The first part of the book has a good description of practical hints about shooting effectively on location. This part is very good. However, the larger part of the book is an out-of-date country by country description. For example, the book still refers to West Germany and East Germany as separate countries. For this to work, the book would need to be updated frequently, especially after September 11th (e.g., Afghanistan and Pakistan)."
5,I love this music!,I was in an a capella group in college and we sang quite a few songs from this album. The harmonies are lovely and the messages are relevant.
1,Mass production at its finest...,After my 1st PocketMouse died only 2 months after the warranty was up I decided to give it another chance and order another...which also died conveniently about 4 months after the warranty was up. I can either continue to purchase these mice and hope for the best or find a better product. Clearly Kensington cares more about quantity rather than quality...
4,I like this product,This product is convenient and works as advertised. It makes cleaning my make-up brushes much easier. I will definitely buy it again.
2,I Agree With Everyone Else Here,"Yup this album is pretty bad. I was looking for some rare disco tunes, like on those Disco Gold albums, but instead got a lot of poor quality nonsense on this CD. And what was that John Travolta song doing on the album? It wasn't even uptempo, let alone disco. The only saving grace for this album, which is really why I wanted it and gave it 2 instead of 1 stars, was because of the track 'We're On The Right Track' by Ultra-High Frequency. It's a rare Philly disco dancefloor burner from 1973. The song was redone many times by other Philly groups like South Shore Commission (same backing track, though different vocals) and the Blue Magic (live and on album), so other people in addition to myself must have liked it. :)If you like 'We're On The Right Track', the quality is great on this album. The other cuts - well, you can find them on other compilations and they probably sound better too."
3,NOT SO BAD !,"I bought this CD in spite of the terrible reviews, and am enjoying it very much. Admittedly short on actual disco tunes, it does have some redeeming qualities, my favorite being an extended (7 minute) version of the soul classic ""BE THANKFUL FOR WHAT YOU'VE GOT"" by William DeVaughn. I have always loved the flamboyant Disco Tex and His Sex-o-letts and even the classic synthesized ""POPCORN"", so I have to give it 3 stars. My copy didn't seem to have the sound quality problems mentioned in the other reviews. Most were quite clear."
2,Its A Great Party Starter,But let's just hope everyone at the party is highly intoxicated.... This cd is o.kay but it works best when people are partying.
1,Twenty minutes and one track of cacaphony.,Don't buy this unless you are a die hard fan of sixties avante garde bull. This CD only has one twenty minute track. The first eighteen minutes sounds like random noise and leads to a sixties pop song using William Blake's poem Garden of Love as lyrics.
3,"OK, but ...","The thread inside the knobs is plastic, so if you tighten the knob too hard, the knob will break ...I used the second knob, didn't tighten it too hard but I'm afraid it will get loose after a while ...Next time I buy knobs I will make sure the inside part is metal"
2,fanotr,Works but I don't expect it to last. Cheap plastic that I heard crack when I put the first on one. Good thing I only needed one and there were two in the package.
5,Pot knobs,These pot knobs are a perfect fit for my mothers' manga lite pots. I recommend these pot knobs to anyone hoping to not to have throw away their pots.
1,I should have believed other reviews regarding product quality !,"I have a BS in Industrial Engineering & consider myself much more than an amateur handyman. i thought I wouldn't crack the plastic knob when inserting the screw!! Well guess what, these are cheap plastic & have no metal threaded insert like my vintage Club Aluminum cookware set. So both these ""Fitz All"" knobs ended up in the trash. Amazon why do you continue to stock these inferior replacement knobs?? I would gladly pay more to get something that is high quality for those of us that like to keep our things at least like they came new or better!"
1,"s video cable, no bueno for computer to tv signal","I bought this for s video output from my computer to a 40"" tv. Picture was way blurry. Vga cable worked much better in my case."
5,"no, you cannot invite that frog!","great cinderella story, mixed between muppets and people, so many funny lines that you pick up on once you watch the movie a few times, so funny!"
3,Belinda Montgomery Is Excellent!,"This is a modernized version of one of the world's most beloved fairy tales. However, sometimes modernized is not good, but for this movie, it is! The story is moving and touching and the acting is swell to boot. It's also very funny too (the jokes are zany!). The romance also follows along with the film as well. It's very romantic.The only thing is the settings aren't that realistic. They seem as if they had been made by hand, and not by Mother Nature. But guys, don't take on. Buy this. It is very good!"
5,"Au revoir, tristesse","This is a very tightly crafted,emotionaly intense novel, a fascinating mixture of lucidity,sarcasm,irony, self deprecating humor and also compassion, tenderness and unhinged sensuality.Seemingly a free spirit,an artist,Claire Neil-the tormented daughter,mother, former wife and reborn hot lover-is in reality a whirlpool of contradictory sentiments and emotions in quest of moral options. At the end of the book, she overcomes her diffidence, her overly cautious ways, through-what else?-love.Not an easy read(the writing of Jean Harris is dense,apothegmatic,cross-cultural and always intellectually challenging),""Diffidence"" becomes a hypnotic lecture, once you enter its elaborated construction.Jean Harris is a true writer, gifted, sensitive , in great control of her skills."
3,It was not New as described,"Pump is OK, but arrived in an open box and was sold to me as new.I am assuming it was returned to Amazon at one point because I found the bottom plastic cover of the pump cracked a little.The crack did not affect its operation, nontheless, I am certain it was returned.Its not worth my time and effort to return it, but Amazon should have never sold it as new."
5,Our pump died so we had to replace it.,This works great. It is real quiet. We do not even hear it running. We go in and check it every once in awhile. This is a good product.
4,Very reliable but very rusty,"I bought it from a local store three years ago, it's very reliable, and has been working every day for the last three years without any problem. Only thing bad is the top case is very rusty and starts to peel off. So I just bought another same from Amazon as a replacement."
3,Stated cord length is incorrect,"I purchased this exact model Flotec sump pump (FPPM3600D) from a local big name home improvement store, and discovered it has a 6 foot long cord, not an 8' as the description here states. This makes a difference for me, and thought it might for some of you.Have been unable to install it as a result. I marked it 3 stars because Amazon requires you to rate something in order to comment on it."
3,Needs a longer float rod.,"It's a sump pump and it's fairly new, so I cannot comment on its long-term performance, which is the only criterion you should ever consider aside from type (submerged or pedestal). What I will say is that it is packed well, it looks sturdy, and comes with a too-short float rod. Consider the scenario of its intended use.You would use this is a basement where you would *not* want to dig a hole. Therefore, you want the float almost resting on the floor since two inches of water is really two inches too many. The rod has about a 3-4"" gap between the bottom of the float and the floor, thus the dilemma.Now, you can just source your own rod by taking a short trip to a big box or plumbing supply store, but why should you? What would be the harm, really, in shipping a float rod 4"" longer? None, is the correct answer.--#"
2,You can sum it up on one page!,"...Feeling overwhelmed, the title drew me to the book, but I found out that 99% of it was how to spot burnout! I don't need to know how to spot it as I already am burnedout!I think that many others like me would think that the most valuable information was the conclusion of the book which consisted of 2 pages on prevention and recovery. I will use that information, but shouldn't have wasted me time on the rest! That caused burnout right there!"
1,Good luck with this one!,This book was a complete waste of time as was the online site that goes with it! There are absolutely not grammar explanations or help of any kind. Most of the chapters are full of assignments and a few lists of items. I have visited Germany and was very excited about really getting into and learning the language but this book turned me in the opposite direction. I have no idea who put this book together or who's idea it was to use it to actually teach anyone.If you are required to use this book for an Introduction to German class I strongly suggest getting alternate learning books and materials. Deutsch heute is a mess!
1,bad book for learning,"This book doesn't make sense. It gives you german phrases before showing how to say them. even at that, it doesn't tell you what each phrase translates to in the dialogs. There is no context for, oh, beginners. Seriously, an introductory book for beginners that doesn't put things in a logical order is just a sign of stupidity. I took latin for years and the Wheelock's Latin book made more sense than this. An intro should not presume prior involvement with the language like this book does. Do not buy this unless you really have to."
2,Where is this going?,"I try and try to understand the fascination with Tavener. I still don't get it. This is mediocre, meandering music. At least it's well performed."
1,A disappointed reader,"O'Hara offers well-worn platitudes and over-used examples of the benefits to be gained from finding a ""quiet corner,"" i.e. breathing, solitude, self-awareness. Nothing new here. One example of her wisdom: ""Don't be afraid to entertain the suggestions of others, but don't lock yourself into someone else's vision. Spread your wings in your quiet corner so that you will fly into the world with your personal style in full feather."" I agree with the Abbot of the Zen Studies Society who recommends the book on its front fly-leaf: ""Just reading the chapter titles is worthwhile."" That's exactly what consumers should do. Then put the book back for someone else to haplessly purchase."
2,Not for the general reader,"The forward to J. Robert Oppenheimer emphasizes that the book was unfinished at the time of Abraham Pais's death but his massive collection of notes and research were in such organized form that the publisher felt they could be used by Robert P. Crease to finish the project. Unfortunately both Mr. Pais and Mr. Crease had in mind a readership at their own level of expertise. This book is thorough, well organized, full of technical minutiae but is not for the general reader. A prerequisite should be some grounding in theoretical physics. The book reads like a text. The facts are there, all there, but dry, and sitched together without charm or readability."
2,Boring,"I am an engineer and usually like technically detailed books, but this one was was too much. The book seem to skip around, with no real tie ins, between high level quantum mechanics and personal details. It was very much like a bunch of random notes pasted together."
2,Yikers!,"I was so wanting to enjoy this book.First part was interesting, then there was a change.About 1/4 to 1/3 way through the writer goes on this bizarre tangent about university.I truly had to check my Kindle to see if I'd changed the book I was reading.Sorry, but have to say pass. Was so hoping it would have been better."
4,Nice jazzy bossa,"I enjoyed this CD quite a bit. There's lots of mellow bossa on this CD with a little hot samba and jazz mixed in. Has some nice tenor sax solos, and of course great bass solos. Very enjoyable."
1,Bill does NOT save the day on this one....,"After the first few promising bars, the wind chimes kick in and you know that this lightweight recording is far, far less than the sum of its parts. After running through it a few times, it's going right to the used bin. While Bill turns out a couple of nicely lyrical solos, he, like the rest of the band phones it in. The most disappointing is the cheesy sax tone of Houston Person. Like Sanborn for the New Age set."
2,Mic placement problems?,"Listen to track 4, do they have mics under their nose? All I hear is an asmatic player! I may be wrong, judge for yourself."
3,Gold Toe Knit Liner Sock-3pack,I'm very disappointed in this particular Gold Toe sock. It fits loose on the top of my foot and around my ankle. It needs to be snug in all areas. I'm going to donate all of these new socks to a charity. I don't like how they fit or look. Buy another style. I haven't had this problem with other Gold Toe socks.
5,good socks,"I like these socks and wear them all the time. After many washes they are still fine. I prefer cotton socks to artificial fiber, and these are mostly cotton. I'm glad they are not thicker because it's rather warm here in Texas."
1,Yellow Toe socks not what they use to be.,"I really liked gold toe socks and wasn't able to buy them locally. When I found gold toe socks on Amazon, I ordered six pair of them thinking they were the same product I had purchased in the past. They were NOT. The fabric is thin and after wearing my first pair for two hours, I had a hole in the heel of the stocking. I checked my shoes to make sure there were no rough spots and they were smooth on the inside. The stocking is just inferior and poorly made. I am very SORRY that I made this purchase."
5,Compilation Master CD from a Vocal Master,"Technique, feeling - a splendid show of scats, vocalises, singing - compiled from the wonderful Muse Records tapes recorded by Professor Mark Murphy. I have hardly all Mark Murphy's CDs and I have this compilation too. And I want more!"
4,"Hey, yo ... Boyz from the hood","Projecto uno are most probably known in the rest of the world since their major hits ""El Tiburon"", ""Latinos"", ""Materialista"" and others which were back in late 90's.I did listen to their songs many times in Salsa / Merengue clubs in several international towns and am thoroughly impressed by how much buzz they create with songs.I somehow got ""homesick"" for the buzz those guys create, (who wouldnt ;-)Thats why I bought the CD now, also it was released long time back.The CD is very listenable and motivating. The party is there right from the first beats.Note that the CD contains actually 12 songs and 1 intro.Your CD player will show 13 but the intro is only 30 secs.The only things that I found that you might want to argue about is that f.e ""El Tiburon"" is f.e not included. Also this CD is better listened to in one go as the songs are mixed together and if you actually pick a single song it feels sometimes like you start in the middle of a party."
2,Derivative and Disappointing,"I first heard Sheila Chandra in a radio interview and was impressed enough to run out and get this CD.I wanted to like the music and the artist. I enjoy Indian music and most experimental music. Indipop is fertile ground for some truly original and exciting music. But this isn't it.The overarching impression this album left me was that of an underdeveloped, juvenile artist (approximately 8th grade). In other words, the experiment flopped. I cannot listen to this album without constantly hearing John Cage, Yoko Ono, Brian Eno and Ofra Haza and even the Art of Noise. I enjoy many of these artist because their art is authentic. Chandra's philosophy of song is woefully sophmoric and derivative. Yes it reminds me of those late night bull sessions -- in junior high school."
2,Barely adequate for any artist,"I have used this projector and a stand for over two years, using it for pencil composition overlays for paintings. The unit is nicely designed, light weight, and easy to use. The problem with it is the poor optical quality, it must be used in a pitch black room and if you are enlarging a photo, many times the image is so blurry, that it is difficult to determine when it is in focus. It is mainly only good for getting a rough idea of where you are placing objects in the painting, any detail work needs to be drawn by eye. Another problem is the image window size of only 7""x7"", which means you may need to project large photos and materials at a smaller size or in pieces, to get them to fit into the small window size. I am now in the process of replacing this opaque projector with a digital projector that can be connected directly to my computer, I feel it is a better use of money to pay a little more and get a more usable piece of equipment."
3,Not too bright,"I don't really expect an opaque projector to project extremely brightly, but this one - I could barely see what was projected - and in a pitch dark room. Would I buy this one again? Probably not."
3,Where's the punctuation?,"The book itself is great, but the publisher decided to leave out some of the punctuation. It is a bit frustrating when you try to read. This is a heads up for all who wish to purchase it."
3,No Punctuation,"I just got a copy of this book. It lacks periods and colons in the main body of the text. The articles are good, but, like the last reviewer said, it is difficult to read."
5,Perfection,"All writings of Meher Baba are above and beyond the usual scope of ""new age"" drivel. He speaks with total knowledge, truth and love. This book is unlike any other you will find."
3,Not for everyone,"This book is not for everyone. It has lot of details of how masts were contacted, and their physical characteristics and abnormal behaviour. It does not have much content regarding the experience of the masts or the work that Meher Baba has done with them. Given that nobody has ever wrote or heard about masts, makes this a rare publication."
2,Dry and Disappointing,"Considering the fascinating nature of the topic, especially to Westerners who are not familiar with the strange behavior of masts, I was surprised at just how boring this book was. You're given extremely detailed info as to the appearance and habits of various masts but only from a dry, superficial and external perspective -- never any juicy insights into their subjective experience. Masts are categorized as a 1st level or 5th level, etc. but the basis for the categorization seems arbitrary and baseless to me and I've studied higher consciousness experiences for over 30 years. The descriptions nof Meher Baba's work with the masts can be summarized as caring for their physical needs, and that's it!! -- again no insights into the subjective interactions going on. Devotees of Meher Baba are likely to find some inspiration into these stories, but I recommend anyone else to stay away."
2,Poor quality DVD,"This is not a review of the movie, but a criticism of the MGM DVD release. The Pride and the Passion DVD as first released is a pressing using old unrestored film stock, complete with scratches, dust marks, overall magenta color, poor film and sound track registration. This movie deserves a complete restoration to it's original condition. If you haven't seen the movie, buy it. If you're a film collector, be satisfied with a VHS tape as this DVD is no improvement."
4,Epic scope and action compensate for improbable casting.,Compelling story and great production values. So what if Grant and Sinatra are miscast. The story is both compelling and exciting. The final scenes of the peasants storming Avila are still emotionally powerful. I loved it when I saw it in the theatre as a child and I love watching the video today. A real guilty pleasure! How about a DVD version?
3,"Great movie, terrible DVD","First of all this movie is not widescreen. Second, the audio is poor. What a shame for such a terrific movie. I can't believe MGM, or someone, does not issue this the way it should. Example: The recent release of El Cid is beautiful. THIS movie deserves no less."
4,Hollywood needs to get back to the basics,"Pretty much all the other reviews cover this movie extremely well. It is one of Hollywood's great films. It's a shame that ""Around the World in 80 Days"" took the best picture Oscar that year instead of this movie. I would love to see a remake... Pierce Brosnan in Cary Grant's role, Mark Anthony in Frank's role, and Sophia? Who else but J Lo."
3,HARD TO FIND OLDIES,"I AM A CARY GRANT FAN AND HAVE MOST OF HIS MOVIES. THIS ONE WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND UNTIL THE INTERNET. THE STORY IS NOT BAD, THOUGH RATHER PASSE IN THIS DAY AND AGE, WHICH IS ACTUALLY A RELIEF. TYPICAL BATTLE OF THE SEXES WITH A STORY WRAPPED AROUND IT TO GIVE IT CONTINUITY. NOT A MOVIE TO BE REWATCHED VERY OFTEN, BUT GOOD TO HAVE IN A COLLECTION. THESE OLD ONES WILL BE IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND SOMEDAY."
1,DVD not playable in United States,"The DVD cannot be played in the United States, I tried it on a Mac and on a PC, with the same result: the playable region cannot be changed to make it playable in the US"
4,The Pride and the Passion,"I really liked the movie because of the the actors and the story because it was based on The Gun by C. S. Forrester, one of my favorite authors. It is fun to see actors in thier prime. Frank Sinatra did a pretty good job with a Spanish accent and Cary Grant was great. Sophia Loren was as good as she could be with the dialogue, but is always beautiful. I will watch it several times more."
3,stars overpower story,My husband's memory of this movie and fascination with the historical plot prompted us to buy the movie. The story is very interesting and makes you want to get a book to learn more about the subject. But I couldn't help but feel the actors overpoweredthe story with their own star personas in this particular rendition. They seemed to be more playing to the camera than beinginvested in the plot.
4,"Large cast, big cannon...good story....","One never forgets a good movie, and this is one of them. Saw this moviemany many years ago a couple of times and was is ever sweet. There is something about having large casts that makes the movie better. I dontlike movies which the whole movie ueses 1 or 2 sets. This movie moves youacross the country with great scenery and great actors of that time.Some say they were miscast, i say if you did'nt know who they were, youdid'nt care...but you did care about that big cannon and where it wastrying to go. Like i said..big adventure big cannon, big satisfaction.Not for everybody i guess.. but sure is great for me.Good for a lifetime keeper."
3,Listen to the music,"Rarely mentioned among these reviews is the major reason for watching (or buying) this film on DVD - the musical score by George Antheil. The film was an obvious star vehicle by an inexperienced (at the time) director, Stanley Kramer, and it is not high drama. It can be boring in places. But concentrate on the musical score and you will surely be entertained. Antheil's great score is not available on CD and the record has long been out of print. But it is definitely worth the price of the film."
2,Star Power? Gun Powder!,"A Most unusual missfire! Stanley Kramers epic really falls short in almost all aspects of film making.The casting of Frank Sinatra is unreal for the part of the crusading rebel. Cary Grant seems real tired with his lines and also seems to hope that no one in the audience is listening to them. Fiery Sophia Loren looks great and also she looks great and I suppose she looks great.The real star? a Big Gun that is pushed , pulled and lifted through the whole film. Acting by this gun far exceeds the rest of the cast.On your way to Avila..the film seems to fall into the pit of absurdity.You can stay for the whole trip however dont have any solid food before the opening credits."
3,Big Gun No Fun,"I bought this on a whim since I remeber seeing the film when it came out and love Forester novels. Trouble is, its all Hollywood with Italians (Sinatra and Loren) playing Spaniards and Cary Grant putting on his dress navy coat just to haul a cannon 600 miles across Spain. The VCR I received was good quality for its age so no complaints there. It just is not a very good film."
1,This book induces sleeping!,"I'm writing this mostly for teachers who may get the idea to assign this book for a class. Please don't. It is terrible book that I, an art student, couldn't read for longer than two pages in a sitting. It felt over my head, because even though it is categorized as an art book it is in fact a psychology book. When I asked other students if they were having similar troubles with it, they all agreed, saying that even when they reread the paragraphs several times they still didn't grasp the concepts. The author is far too long-winded as well and feels that she must repeat the same thing over an over to drive the point home, when really each chapter could be reduced to one question. Moving on to the next point, a majority of the book is written in questions which makes it all the more difficult to understand."
4,A hoot,"""Karvoski's a hoot and so is his book. Check it out."" -- Archie Rothman, 4-FRONT MAGAZINE (Los Angeles)"
1,"Needs proofread, BADLY!","I'm presently using this as a textbook in an into-level EE class. The book is a great concept - give a book of problems and enough information on the theory to solve them, including some step-by-step examples. And, sometimes, it works well. What kills it are the repeated glaring errors in the answers it gives for the questions - so far, I'd venture to say that, after the first couple chapters, more then 10% of the answers are wrong, be it from swapping a sign someplace or an outright mistake in understanding on the part of the person who solved the problem. This makes the book uterly and totally unacceptable - it has as much potential to damage someone's knowledge of electronics as to teach the person."
2,Not Helpful,"So I was having a lot of problems with my Electrical Circuits class, and desperately needed help... I saw this book, said it contained all the basics, easy to understand, blah blah blah...Unfortunately it was just like my textbook... so it didn't have a positive nor negative effect on me... it acts like sparknotes... simply putall of the equations in a smaller book...So if you're trying to have something condensed, get it... if you're trying to understand, seek help at the school because there are no books currently available to guide you step by step"
3,Im not surprised this has not been updated.,"Basically, all of the reviews for this study guide is spot on. Its well formatted however, I would say this is a true to form Schaum's guidebook in its style. This is where the quality disparity begins however. There are some mistakes in calculation and explanation, at least if one is a beginner or college engineering freshman, would be incorrigible to understand why its wrong. This book is not written as a helping guide, rather its flow is similar to a semesters simplified syllabus. In other words, if you go in knowing these simple problems you will be ill prepared for an engineering exam which are undoubtedly worded the same and far more complicated.It is as if a professor just drills the basics and does not elaborate on purpose, theory or usefulness in design. If you can get a seniors notes from class from a previous year, they may be equivalent to what this book has to offer."
5,Marvelous Indeed,"Since everything I've ever heard Lee Lessack do is too marvelous for words, this CD is very aptly named. And when you're talking about a tribute CD to Johnny Mercer, how CAN you go wrong? This CD is a great combination of better- and lesser-known songs by Johnny Mercer, and really shows what a versatile songsmith he was. But an even bigger selling point for me is that the CD is recorded live, so you get to find out more about the artist performing -- and Lee Lessack is a very charming, witty, SUPER talented performer. I think he's got to be the best male voice in cabaret, and one of my favorite male voices in any genre. His version of ""When October Goes"" (featured on both this recording and ""I Know You By Heart"") is heartbreaking and in my opinion, the definitive version. My suggestion -- snap up this and Lee Lessack's other recordings ASAP."
4,Superb phone with great features!,"I have had this phone going on a year now and can faithfully say that I have very few complaints!! First of all the phone has NEVER and I mean NEVER failed me! This will be the 5th Sanyo I have owned, starting with the faithful 4500, and have never been let down. I have seen numerous complaints about sound quality, but short of the volume being a little low on occasion, I cannot see too much fault. The speakerphone is only half-duplex, but most cell phone speakerphones are only HD at the moment. Also you cannot expect board room sound out of a tiny micro-sized speaker! It does very well for its size. Ready link performance is top rate, as well. All in all another great Sanyo product!"
2,Great Phone But...........,"Having just sent a Samsung A-500 swimming off of Catalina Island, I decided to try a change of pace with the Sanyo 8200. As others have noted, the Functions and Menus on this phone are outstanding. The Camera is a lot of fun and really preforms pretty well.That being said, I'm really dissappointed with this phones sound quality. When listening to callers with the phone flipped open, you'd swear that each and every one of your callers has swallowed a bag full of cotton or marbles. The calls sound downright horrible. It only gets worse once you plug in the earbud. Turning up the volume only distorts the call even worse.I'd love to keep this gadget friendly phone but will be switching back to the Samsung. Its sound quality is 10 times better than the 8200 even though I will have to live with its limited features.Really surprised Sanyo skimped on a key feature for this otherwise excellent phone."
3,"Excellent features, better than most","The features on this phone are awesome and certainly this phone is easy to use. The speakerphone is also by far the best I have encountered. However, the clarity of calls is a slight issue. The volume control does not seem to do a whole lot for the clarity as people sound too loud or not loud enough, and even when not on speaker sometimes it feels like they are because of the way the phone sounds. Even when I have perfect reception and am in an area where I know others Sprint phones are working just fine. Have not decided yet whether or not to switch phones or just stick it out, but two years is a long time. I also do not know what other phone I would go with as there is not a consensus on one excellent phone all around.Hope this helps."
1,charging problems with Sanyo 8200,"the customer who wrote the negative review on her terrible experience with charging the phone is ABSOLUTELY CORRECT! She is not lying...this experience is what has led me to the Amazon website today to try and purchase alternate charging accessories since my phone will not hold a charge and reflects ""charge complete"".Another issue is the purchase of a warranty for the said phone...because Sprint's customer care is so disgusting one should ALWAYS get maintenance...I had my phone for 2 days beyond their 14 day requirement and Sprint would not allow me to add maintenance, so I am a VERY disgruntled customer!"
3,Sanyo 8200 Phone Problems,"Although the Sanyo 8200 has many great features, there are three problems that may be inherent in the design of this model.1) Overheating of the handset with backlit turned off. Although store testing finds the product to be within the appropriate testing range, this does not mean that there is not a problem.2) Adjustability of the receiver volume. After repeated testing at all levels, either cannot hear everything being said or voice echoing occurs or voice distortion at higher levels.3) Receiver feature and camera feature share same space. When switching from left ear to right ear, it is difficult to find a position to hear from. Have to move the phone almost below the earlobe to get reception.I found this to be true with at least 6 other phone users.The Sprint Store does not take these problems seriously enough to replace the phone for a different model."
4,from Nextel to Sprint,"Well I rescently switched from Nextle to Sprint. I switched because of the price and the hardware. The price, you get what you pay for. I live an area that is very affulient and about an hour from Boston, Ma. I never had many issues with connectivity to Nextel. And I did not assume I would have any issues with Sprint either boy was I wrong. There is a stop on my way to work where I have full signal strength and my call gets dropped every time. Sprint is bad in my area.The phone however ROCKS, Nextel has crappy phones for gadget freaks like me. This phone you can download songs to the ringer not just midi's. The screen is big and bright, unlike the new i730's tiny screen. The camera is easy and fun to use, and with the color display on the outside of the phone you can even take pictures of yourself if you are that vain. The battery last well.If Nextel could get some cool phones I would switch back... Oh wait I have a 2 year contract. I guess I will have to wait.I hope this helps"
4,Great Phone!,"I was looking for phone w/ good functionality. I could careless about the bells and whistles. Custom ringtones, screensavers, games? Who cares! I remember when phones were just phones. But I must confess this time around I wanted a camera in my phone. I'm always using my digital camera but because it's so big and bulky (plus who wants to drag around a digicam when you're in a poolhall or bar?) I rarely have it with me. After doing my homework I settled on the 8200 and wow was I ever impressed! The camera works great but obviously it can't compare to my 4MP digicam. But whenever I need a camera I can always count on my phone being there w/ me. The rest of the phone is great. The menu is intuitive and very easy to use. The speakerphone is clear and web browsing just as good. Although navigation can be kind of tricky at times. Overall a very well balanced phone. I highly recommend this!"
1,Failing grade on reception clarity,"I bought this recently at RadioShack and am probably going to return it. Like some other reviewers, I am experiencing constant voice distortion with this phone - voices sound slightly garbled. The phone doesn't drop calls but I am having a really hard time hearing clearly and am often having to ask the other person to repeat what they just said. The people I talk to say they can hear me just fine. I can't recommend a phone that fails on such a basic and important feature as reception clarity."
3,Battery Won't Hold Charge,My battery will not hold more than one bar(if lucky) unless I spend half my day plugging and fiddling with wire. Problem onset was at about 13th month. Now i need a new phone but would rather remedy the issue if possible.I'll keep looking but man its easy to tell which are Sprint reps and which are phone users.
3,OK at best,"I just bought this phone at Radio Shack on Friday. I returned it on Sunday. Nice features, but the audio quality is awful."
2,VERY ATTRACTIVE THATS ALL,"MY PHONE IS A CANDY RED GETS LOTS OF ATTENTION USING IT, BUT THE THE RING TONES ARE TO LOW IF YOU PUT IT IN YOUR PURSE YOU WILL NEVER HERE IT ,YOU HAVE TO PUT IT ON VIBRATE AND RINGER AND KEEP IT IN YOUR POCKET. NEVER COULD USE THE SPEAKER PHONE I COULD HERE THEM BUT THEY COULD NOT HERE ME MY VOICE WOULD SOUND MUFFLE."
5,Hats off to VEI,"Hats off to VEI for making this possible. I have just received my set today and have watched a few episodes. Show looks great. One must keep in mind these were transferred from tapes so you won't have the sharpness of a show transferred from film. These are the original 70's version. Refer to VEI's review for technical aspects of the transfer. These must have been transferred from possibly Analog Betamax to Digital Batacam at some point. Digital Betamax came out in the early 90's. It looks like VEI did the best with the tapes that Universal provided them. The box reads ""Copyright 2012 Universal Studios"", ""Distributed by Visual Entertainment Inc., Toronto Ontario"", ""Made in Canada"". Individual Seasons state ""Made in U.S.A."" The packaging is of quality. It contains 7 standard DVD size season cases protecting 3 discs each. Thanks to VEI for a job well done."
3,"Need confirmation that these are the ORIGINAL 70's episodes, not the re-edited ones from the 1990's","Original theme song, original opening graphics/titles, original breaks and bumpers or NO SALE. If anyone gets the definitive answer on the content of this set, please post and/or reply!"
5,"The Disco Diva From Brooklyn, N.Y.!!!!","""Doctor's Orders"" sounds as fresh & catchy today as it did the first time I heard it on the car radio in 1975! ""Midnight Love Affair"" is still the same sexy/sultry throbber, after all these years! If Donna Summer had the pipes, & Gloria Gaynor had a raspy/velvety voice than Carol should be remembered for having the sweet-sounding, ear candy voice of Disco. All her top tunes are showcased here on this CD, except her heartfelt single ""So You Win Again"" from 1978. Her original tunes stand out best: ""Burnin'"", ""A Hurricane Is Coming Tonite"", ""Fell In Love For The First Time Today"", & ""I Got The Answer"", as well as the two mentioned above. Carol also adds her special touch to 12"" single versions of songs she covered, ""Dancing Queen"" & ""Night Fever"" (although her versions lack the excitement of the originals, they're still fun to listen to as curiosities, as far as why she recorded them in the first place). Buy this if you wanna take a trip down Disco Memory Lane!"
1,CD-R's Are A Rip Off,"Look, the music on here is great if you are into disco from the 70's but I am really opposed to paying more than about 50 cents for a CD-R. I have read reviews of other products on Hot Productions and they also indicated that they are CD-R's as well (Santa Esmeralda comes to mind immediately). Still it is nice to have the music...."
2,Truth Is Not Justice,"Ms. Story has rewritten this book and titled the book, Innocent Criminal. Truth Is Not Justice was her first published book, it had too many errors. The book now has more pages, no errors, more pictures and has more substance. Innocent Criminal is looking for a publisher and will be on the market soon. This book has captured the discrimination within Pittsburgh and throughout the United States of America. This is a well written book. I was fortunate to get a copy of the book and I can't wait for others to read it. Truth Is Not Justice would be very useful in an english class."
3,"Worth the sale price I paid, but not much more.","To reclaim a bench that had been overloaded with coats/hats/mittens/bags/etc., I ordered three of these when they were on sale. I feel they were worth the thirty bucks, but thats about all.Pros:+ Large ""pegs"" make for lots of hanging space+ Wide enough legs to be plenty stable+ Easy to assemble (about 15 minutes)Cons:- ""Trunk"" is two pieces, and the wood tone/grain doesn't always match- Pegs and trunk don't tighten and stay place; they just keep spinning- Overall, seems unlikely to last long without copious amounts of Gorilla Glue"
2,It will break soon - Just OK with thin and light garments,"Just OK for thin and light things like few t-shirts, bras, etc.It will easily break if you put more on it.I don't like it.My wife and I put our shower towels on it.2 of its branches broke in 2 months.It's waste of time and money.Just OK for few, light, and thin garments."
2,Falls Apart,"The pegs attach to the pole with small screws that are too short. I tried reinforcing them with glue, but it didn't help. After less than a year, I had to replace this coat tree."
3,Nice idea,"Attractive looking; easy to assemble;However when I had a broken piece of wood I asked for a replacement, the manufacturer wanted to see a receipt that I actually purchased this product. What do they think someone is going to randomly ask for a free piece of wood??I find clothes slide off easy. I'm now looking for a coat rack with metal hooks."
4,Excellent Study!,I have just completed the 15 week study from this book and I found that I truly learned more studying the bible through the inductive system than by any other means. I highly recommend this book!
1,Yuck!@,"I believe the other reviews must be by children who performed in the play and it's understandable that their taste for music has not yet developed. While I might give it a fair rating, taking into account that it's kids singing, I must, being objective and taking into account all performers, give this quite a poor rating indeed."
3,Not a return after all.,"I ordered this CD by mistake, thinking it was the soundtrack to the movie of the same name. I listened to it and I was about to return it but I had a change of heart. I thought about how well the music and the performers sound so I decided to keep it.Additionally, I ordered the actual soundtrack of the movie. If you like musicals performed on stage this CD is for you. Recommended."
4,Correction,"I'd written a review about this soundtrack last year, shown on this page. I hadn't realized the soundtrack listed wasn't the original movie soundtrack. I haven't heard the import version, and so cannot review it. Oops. :)I've been contacted by a few people looking for the original recording. Well, I had a copy of the original soundtrack on an LP. I've loaned it an Amazon reader and Busgy Malone enthusiast and am now looking forward to getting it back, someday. So if you've got a bloodhound to spare, drop me a line and maybe we can talk. :)"
3,A classic stage and movie production,"Although this recording is the from the orginal cast version and not the movie, it still brought home memories of the songs that made it so rememberable. When compared to the movie version I felt it lacked the raspy voices of song. This version had talented young actors and actresses singing the songs. If you like movie soundtracks then this isn't it, but if you like stage soundtracks then this is it. I'm still searching for the movie soundtrack, but am gladly adding this to my library."
2,Batteries drain even when turned off,"These drain the batteries (4xAAA) even when turned off, and the belt clip makes the batteries inconvenient to remove. For this reason, I don't recommend this model."
5,Just what I was looking for!,"I am just getting started with origami so I just needed some paper to practice with. I am not an expert in origami paper but this works perfect for what I was looking for. The only thing I do not like is that the paper is the same color on both sides. That being said, I knew that when I ordered this product so I can not lower the rating for something I already knew. It is the perfect texture and thickness. I love it."
2,It was open,It was what I ordered just the paper was loose in the box .. So I was disappointed in it . Not sure how to give it away for Christmas now :(
1,Overpriced and poor quality,These papers are thinner than printer paper. Origami paper is supposed to be somewhat thicker. This is just plain poor quality paper packaged as origami paper. And they charged more than $12 for it?? Very disappointed.
2,I will stick with my heavier origami paper,"I was not a fan of this paper. The package was sliced when I received it (shipping/seller error)so some of the corners were bend, which really sucks when making origami. Also, I didn't realize how thin this paper is. I prefer the thicker paper, and I will definitely be sticking with the 3X3, although this is good for beginners learning to make creases and folds. I wont be using this paper again."
2,It's an okay product,"It's a great price for a lot of origami paper. Couple bad things about it though... It arrived slightly damaged(See pics I added), and it's not exactly 6"" by 6""(See pics for this too)."
4,work nice,it is paper what can i say. it folds good. i can have fun making my animal and flowers and stuff.
3,Good price but not like regular origami paper,"I bought this because our 6 year old is constantly doing origami. It shipped really fast, which was good considering we ran out and I had to keep cutting squares from copy paper.First of all, there's a great variety of colors in the pack....except black. And it's pretty lightweight, which is also good. But the texture is more like lightweight construction paper and won't hold up to repeated creasing. Also, it's colored on both sides.I think this paper is fine if you are a beginner and not doing complicated folds. Also, the price is really cheap if you are doing lots of modular pieces. But I can't recommend it for an advanced folder."
2,Bad fold,"If you buy this paper for origami, be aware that it does not fold well. I recommend buying a better quality product."
2,I do not recommend this paper...,I thought I was getting a great deal on this product. That's a lot of origami paper at a great price. But this paper does not fit the standards of good folding paper. It doesn't fold well and everything you make just doesn't look right. This paper is just one step above construction paper. I bought this paper with the intent on using it with the kids I work with as a fun activity for them and teach them something new. I work with troubled teens and some have Mild MR so trying to teach them this fine art with inferior paper has proven difficult. I will not buy this paper again.
3,Just ok,"This paper is good for practice or to use with groups of children. It is not the best paper to use for modulars, as the paper is thin and the modulars are more difficult to put together when the paper is too thin. That said, I have ordered this paper twice... the first time all paper was the same as far as the weight/thinness of the paper. The second order - the red was not the same shade of red - more orange than red (though there is an orange in the pack as well) and the weight and quality of the red paper was inferior than the previous order. This was a bit of a disappointment, as I had ordered about 20 packs.I mainly use the paper to practice new folds - and for the brown sheets. Finding a dark brown paper for origami is not easy to find.It is nice to have this paper in supply, as the price is good, but I wouldn't use it exclusively."
2,cheap paper,"This is not what I would call Origami paper. It is the same color on each side and thicker than normal origami paper.That said, it does work ok. I wouldn't recommend it as a gift for someone for to give to kids. The lack of a white side makes it hard to follow some instructions."
2,Flimsy,"These report covers are VERY thin and flimsy. The fact that 25 of them fit in the box should have alerted me to that. If you are looking for sturdy report covers (including the kind that are sort of glossy), don't buy this. If you just need something about as thin as 2 sheets of paper to cover your report, this is what you want. I returned mine."
2,it isn't waterprrof,"I swim everyday. thus I thought it would be a great watch, for it has a leather band, which dries up without getting damaged like a leather bracelet would.After 2 months of wearing it. Watch got foggy.im sending it back."
5,Amazing book about an amazing figure,"This easy to read book provides a close up look at the life of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad in an engaging, conversational tone. The author is the son of a famous British journalist, and has writen several other entertaining biographies and original tales. The font size in this book is large (about 14) which coupled with its fascinating anecdotes makes for fast page turning. The author is not a Muslim and provides a fresh, revealing look at the life of Ahmad that will leave a delightful impression. It has a very sturdy hardback binding on par with the best quality books. Very well written. I read this book about 10 years ago and still remember details."
4,Maria Muldaur and child for children (and adults),"I've been a fan of Maria Muldaur since her Jim Kweskin days so I'll admit to being biased. However, this is an excellent album for introducing children to American classics such as ""Mocking Bird Hill"" or ""On the Sunny Side of the Street""; it includes humor from the Jim Kweskin days ""Never Swat a Fly""; the Mama Cass ""Dream a Little Dream"" ... the result is an album enjoyable by children and adults i.e. just what you need for a trip.The use of her daughter on the album is not a gimmick - it works. Her daughter is musical and her presence helps the album project a playful tone. Maria Muldaur is not playing down to children - she is raising the children up to adult music standards."
2,blah.,I usually use the venus with the bigger head... but I thought since I loved those so much anything by venus would be good.These are no better then their disposable razors.
3,A it too small.,I ordered this product because I was looking for a well made puff for the body. It is well made but way to small. I read. One of the reviews saying they use it for their body. Will keep it until I can find. A larger one.
1,Extremely Disappointed,"This product was extremely disappointing. It was grossly misrepresented when the size was not stated and then when the company charged an amount that no person in their right mind would pay. My husband & I thought that the puff size was sufficient for a persons body, not just their face because the cost was $12.00 when all other competitors prices were around $4. There was also a review on the internet stating that the Laura Mercier's product was so much bigger than a competitor's, much more suitable for a body not just for the face. But to our surprise, we received an 8"" square box by 4"" deep with a crappy little 3"" round face Puff that cost $12 + $5.95 shipping + tax totaling 18.67!!!!Furious, Laurie & Dave Cruikshank"
1,I hate it,Doesn't fit my CR-V and can't return it. Took forever to get it. The vendor has not been helpful. Stay away.
5,An Excellent Film,"I've always enjoyed Van Heflin as a member of the elite among actors. I've never seen him not play a character as well as it could be played, & ""Patterns"" is no exception. Also, this film is perhaps the best of its kind that I have seen. It would seem to me that even somene who had no interest in the business world at all would find this film interesting. But I wish I could have given it 4 stars rather than 5. I can't lay my finger on what it is that keeps the film from being perfect in my mind, but it certainly is better than just a 4 rating, as far as I'm concerned. The film is excellent on all levels. Enjoy."
1,Synergy Version,"There are several makers of this DVD, the movie Patterns. The Synergy version is a shooty work, mine kept freezing hald way through. Other than that, the movie itself is good an well written"
4,Brilliant Film!,"[Original 2004 Review Updated]Serling at his best!Unfortunately, the film print used for the [1998 VHS Edition] looks awful! And the tape's picture quality is really bad -- looks like a bootleg recording copied many times over.A more recent DVD [Critics's Choice 2004 Edition] looks just as bad, if not worse.I'd rate this film five stars, but deducting one star because of poor video qualityUPDATE: July 9, 2005; I just found the new Ryko Distribution (The Roan Group) DVD Edition listed here and judging from reviews, it's an excellent print. FINALLY! I will be buying it soon.My original 2004 review referred to the VHS version and the ""Critics's Choice"" DVD edition."
1,be careful!,"Be very careful. Even though it says Van heflin on some of the ads here, you are likely to get the TV version with Kiley. The TV version is good but , if you want the movie, do some investigation. I recommend doing a google search or checking ebay, and then personally ask the seller what the running time is. If the answer is 59minutes, it's the TV show. If the answer is 83minutes, it's the movie."
1,Horrible Sound Quality,"First off, I did not buy this disk from Amazon, but rather directly from DC LaRue's website. Secondly, I have loved DC's music since the days when his tunes were filling the dance floor (""Hot Jungle Drums and Voodoo Rhythm"" is my fave), but this is NOT a professionally produced CD. It arrived in a slim-case with an obviously inkjet-printed insert, and the music itself was burned onto a regular printable blank Sony consumer CD. As far as the sound quality is concerned, I did a better job transferring these tunes into my Mac directly from 30-year old vinyl than what is being presented here. No dynamic range, distortion (were they burned from 64-bit mp3s?) and WTF is up with the ""click"" between each track? Terribly disappointed with this purchase and I won't be wasting any more money on any of DC's reissues."
5,One of the best disco performers !,I heard this performer on a Studio 54 vinyl record. I think it's a really great performer from the disco era !
4,I liked it!,Excellent use of a plot to discuss ethical ideas. Book is an easy read. And quick. Good for the first time reader of ethics.
5,"passionate, thorough honesty","Washburn has gathered and digested a tremendous amount of relevant information about the corruption of higher education, and shared it in a no-holds-barred manner that blasts much of the veneer from the ivory tower. I've witnessed and puzzled over the surface of what her book dissects. She knows and cares about the entropic processes that seem to be transforming universities from institutions of higher learning into money hungry entities."
5,"It's ""Fast Food Nation"" for the academic world","A great book! It's a pointed critique of how universities have lost their way by involving themselves too closely with the business world. The author does a great job of weaving interviews, anecdotes, history, and economics together.It reminds me of Fast Food Nation: with both books I had to stop reading several times along the way--not because I didn't enjoy it, but simply to keep from getting too angry. (A complement to the authors in both cases!) Although I was able to quit eating fast food altogether, I won't be able to give up my relationship with higher ed...So I can only hope that students, parents, university administrators, scientists, government regulators and business executives read this book--and demand changes."
1,It figures the author would be from California,"Im writing this review just after reading the latest Wall Street Journal ranking of colleges by corporate recruiters. The top schools are in Texas, Pennsylvania, Indiana. Not until 13th place do we see a California university on the list. This means that corporations are largely passing California schools by in their hiring plans. This means that prospective students will increasingly forsake California colleges for those in other states. This will in turn starve our universities of the very students and funds necessary for their survival. These schools will increasingly become underfunded wards of the state, much as the California state college system is today.THIS is the legacy of Ms. Washburn's groundless fear of 'corporate corruption' of her precious academic purity. A purity exemplified by useless curricula that renders 'students' unemployable so that they also can become wards of the state.It figures that she lives in California."
5,Very helpful product,"I picked up a pair of these, four bucks at wallyworld, because I bought a pair of cute flat pumps from LLBean for such a low price that I didn't want to ship them back although the heel was 'way too wide. These didn't solve that problem as the disparity between the shoe and my heel was too great. (Gonna try heel liners.) But once I had these, I tried them in some new winter boots, and they are fantastic. Today I went back for another pair. I bought these marked ""Men's"" because my size nine female foot has an exceptionally long arch - so I correctly assumed the women's would leave my arch hanging in mid-air, which a lot of shoes with supported arches do too. As another reviewer noted, these DO have an adequately long arch. And they are ideal if there is not room in the toe of the shoe for more material, as they end quickly after the arch."
4,Love It,"Seems to be very well made, wide brim is great to keep out the sun, wind or rain. My new favorite hat, I would wear it to work if I could."
4,"Only if you're into ""prog""","If you cannot stomach ""prog-rock"" and would cheerfully shoot Rick Wakeman or Keith Emerson on sight, stop reading this now. This album is not for you. If, however, you never met a synthesiser you didn't like and can get into long, spacey jams titled after comets, Argent's live album will likely go down just fine with you. It features all of prog's granduer/excess (take your pick) in full bloom; spacey synths, pomp-and-circumstance organs, odd-beat bass/drums patterns and the guitar solos straight from the Steve Howe/Hackett riff catalogue. You DO get one ""song"" song here; guitarist Russ Ballard gives a solo reading of his ""I Don't Believe In Miracles,"" as pretty a pop tune as ever there was(and a hit for ex-Zombies vocalist Colin Blunstone). But that's the exception; everything else here is from the prog side of the street and how you like it depends very, very much on your liking for that rock sub-genre. I like."
3,Un Disco Mediocre,Como fan de Alejandro Fernandez lamento mucho que este disco se haya quedado en el camino. Pareciera como si este disco lo hubieran hecho a lo loco al ahi se va solo por contratos que se establecen con una casa disquera y las reglas que se toman. Este disco es a lo que yo llamo un disco relampago. En ciertas canciones los arreglos musicales sobresalen y es por eso que las letras son opacadas. Alejandro sigue teniendo una voz privilegiada de las mejores que ay en estos momentos en America Latina pero este disco no ofrece nada nuevo. Sin duda su disco anterior 'Origenes' se lleva por mucho esta nueva produccion de 'El Potrillo'. Alejandro siempre ah sido un cantante que evoluciona y se arriesga en sus producciones discograficas pero esta vez se quedo en el camino. Creo que es hora de darle oportunidad a los jovenes compositores que estan afuera esperando a quien alguien les abra la puerta y no necesariamente tienen que ser Mexicanos porque la musica no tiene fronteras.
3,I think the hat gave it away.,"Hmmm Mexican music. Very pasionate, lots of guitars and trumpets, haunting melodies which change from crying to celebrating. If that's what you're after, then this may for you.Alejandro is one of the best, if not the best.I sort of like it, but now the more I hear it, its really growing on me, or getting to me. Either way its beautifully produced, sung and holds a clear full sound directly from the latin heart."
4,perfect for the beach,"i'm only sorry i read this while the weather was still bad...i would've loved to read it on the beach. swimmers was fun, entertaining and moving. it was a page-turner. i highly recommend it."
1,Thank you notes,I don't know what the company is looking at when they wrote the name of these. I received them and they are navy blue cards with a paler blue stripe in them.
4,power conditioner,"I recently purchased this power conditioner because I live on the coast of Maine...We have power outages & I have a generator.When power goes out my generator kicks in but my Renaii Heater does not restart because the power is not clean enough. So I purchased this item on the advice of my electrician... We have had one outage since purchase in this case not long enough for the generator to go on but long enough to cut all power for about 5 seconds....When power from the street resumed, my heater started...That is good news !!We often go to Florida for 2 to 3 weeks in the winter and I want rock solid performance if we have a power outage that my generator and heaters will prevent a freeze up....So far so good, we have not had power outage so that the generator will take over, so I am waiting to see how the unit performs then"
1,Does not meet published specs.,"Hello, I first want to say that this is a preliminary review and will follow up after I hear back from Trip-Lite but there are things prospective buyers should know. Both my LC1200's are not meeting published specifications. The specs are NOT posted on amazons website and you need to go to Trip-lite site to read them. Unless your incoming supply voltage is WAY off AND does not vary (your supply voltage is 110v - 112v and does not vary), this unit may be useful. If you supply voltage is more typical of the Northeast power grid (where I'm located) and varies between 117v - 120v, you'll be doing more ""harm"" to your equipment then good by using an LC1200. I apologize for not providing all the spec's right now (Am currently recovering from surgery) but will follow up with full details when I get back to my office (a few days). BTW, I am and have been a licensed master electrician for over 30 yrs. and currently manage an electronics service & repair shop."
1,didn't work for me!,"I bought the zeno just over a month ago, and been using it on a daily basis twice a day, and i'm very sad to say it didn't work for me at all. i've used it on the early stage pimples and they only got bigger after i used it (just as they do without the zeno). I've seen no change whatsoever. I was conviced it would work from all the great reviews, but it didnt. on the up side, it was easy to use and battery lasts a long time i've only charged it twice in the past month. it is hot at first but you get used to it. the area does stay red for at least 5-10 minutes after use but i usually put on concealer to cover the spot anyway."
2,Do NOT buy the Zeno!,"I purchased my Zeno Pro 14 months ago. Since purchase, my Zeno has not held a battery charge for longer than one use. I could charge my Zeno for a full 24 hours, and I still would get only one use out of the device. I was not aware Zeno had a 12 month warranty only. I just now got around to calling for service or replacement, and was told they do not offer repair, and will not replace because I was 2 months outside of the warrantly window. Unbelievable. Defective product, and a company that clearly does not stand by it's product. As for performance controlling acne, I also would not recommend. I don't think it had any impact whatsoever. It may work for those that only get occasional, tiny blemishes. Avoid dealing with this company!"
1,Way too time consuming,"The zeno looks pretty, but just didn't do it for me. Two and a half minutes is far too long if you have more than one pimple to treat. 5 pimples at 2 treatments a day comes out to 25 minutes not including the ridiculous warm up times this thing has. Good luck using Zeno without standing in a mirror and repositioning the tiny treatment plate every 2 seconds to make sure it is touching in the proper spot. Not to mention that the tip has to be replaced every x number of days.As for results, I wasn't able to see results using the zeno. Maybe this is due to the fact that I simply didn't have enough time to do the proper number of treatments on each pimple. If you're looking for an acne treatment device that utilizes this technology, save yourself hours of time and go with the thermaclear. Zeno is worthless as far as I'm concerned."
1,Don't waste your money,I bought this thing after reading the reviews here and in some beauty mags. I've battled acne my whole life. I'm 35 and still have it. Recently I had some laser resurfacing done on my face and thought I'd invest in this little gadget to help stave off the pimples. Invest being the operative word here because it is expensive. I must be the 10% it doesn't work for. I even used it a second time after 4 hrs. as per instructed and no luck. The pimples still came up. [...]
4,It helps,"So, I bought this after reading reviews about it for a couple years. My aesthetician has one that she uses during facials, and it seemed to help a little, so I finally broke down and spent the money. Here is what I have found. It SOMETIMES stops the pimple from forming. The rest of the time, it does not. I'm not sure why or how this happens, but I know the manufacturer says you have to catch the pimple in its early stages. Perhaps that is the problem.What I did find nice is that, even when it doesn't stop the pimple, it makes them less sore, and reduces the puffiness of them. Less puffiness = less redness = less noticable pimples. Excellent. I'm going to keep using this product, and once I figure out the why's and wherefore's, I'll update."
3,So-so results,"After reading many positive reviews for this item I purchased it and 2 replacement cartridges. I was prepared to LOVE my Zeno! Unfortunately it didn't work as well for me as it has for many of the reviewers. Even with multiple treatments, I only had about a 50% success rate with blemishes treated with Zeno. With such a low success rate, it's not worth the cost to me. Ultimately, I made the decision to return it within the 30 day guarantee period."
2,Didn't work for me.,"I am 21 years old, I bought the zeno last year and returned it within a month. I don't have terrible breakouts - maybe one zit a week - not too bad.Anyways, I found that I tried it on all sorts of pimples and had no luck- never once did I see a noticeable difference in the pimple, whether it was small or big it stayed the exact same and 100% of the time it turned even bigger.I bought it based on people's reviews online, and i am so glad it works for people, but for some reason, it didn't work for me, or my boyfriend or my two best friends.... go figure."
2,Not as good as I expected it to be ...,"I purchased the Zeno Pro at the advice of my dermatologist. He is a believer in the product & thought it would help with my frequent bouts of cystic acne along the jawline. Given that it was recommended by an MD, I had *extremely* high hopes. Unfortunately, the results have been very disappointing. The Zeno has done absolutely nothing to clear my skin. It seems to have no impact whatsoever on my acne, even when used at the first tingle of an outbreak. The best I can say is that after using the Zeno, the pimple is somewhat less swollen, making it easier to conceal with makeup. All in all, though, I would say that this is a pretty expensive product that has given me very little return for my money. I would definitely not recommend it."
1,Technology has a wayse to go...,"My Dad had originally bought this for my sister and I both to use, as we have acne. The promise of clearing that 1 big stubborn zit overnight was so tempting, it was really too good to be true.Zeno does not work. Doesn't matter if you use it twice a day or once a week, it does not get rid of your pimples. That is the sad truth.If anything, I think the heat irritated my sister and my pimples, and they turned bright red and looked worse after usage.Don't buy this product thinking it will help. Nice idea, awful execution."
1,it burns my skin,it burns so badly my skin that I stopped using it. I gave up. specially if your pimples come from black or white heads Zeno doens't work at all because you have to take that little stuff out of the pimple anyway so for me it is very pricey and burns your skin. Doens't work!Dont waste your money!!!
1,Not sure how it's getting such good marks...,"This product was a dud for me. It didn't work at all. I'm in my early 20s and this did nothing for me. You're better off with a hot wet towel, which actually does work. It may work if the bump is just growing or the zit is in its early stages, but absolutely does not work once it's developed and past. However, it didn't work for me in the early zit stages either, it only managed to irritate it and make it a full blown problem that much quicker."
1,Not nearly as good as they claim,"I used the Zeno morning and night for days, but failed to see any improvement in my pimples. I then went back to my trusty old spot gel for acne, and now my skin is clearing.I am mystified how they can claim that it heals pimples in a day. There was some improvement, but no more than with any other acne treatment. If you must have this gadget, I would recommend that you use it in addition to, rather than instead of, your usual treatments."
2,ok,"does make acne smaller, but did not make them clear up for me. for holding the thing in place for 2 minutes per zit, takes too much effort and too expensive for just making them smaller.get better results with peter thomas roth acne spot treatment. put it on and overnight its gone. no fuss. would return if i could but am too busy so by the time i got around to it , the time period to return was over."
1,not helpful,"I felt a little stinging at each use and at first it seemed like my bumps would go down, but by the next morning, my zits become bigger."
4,You have to try this!,"You have to try Zeno, I just love it! I use it and it significantly improves the healing time. There is no way it burns skin, unless you don't follow the directions and use it stupidly with medicines or other acne treatments that cause skin sensitivity. I will admit it does get hot, but it does not hurt or burn at all. I've found that keeping the unit charged on a regular basis ensures the battery lasts as designed. This is a really good investment!"
3,"It works, but can get quite expensive","I'm in my early 20's, and have had moderate acne since i was in my early teens. Not really bad, but enough to make me pick at it every now and then. The zeno product is great if you use it 3 times per day. But when you have more than one zit, and you're using this 3 times per day, you use up an entire 60 cartridge zeno tip within a few days. I like the product a lot, I just wish that it weren't so expensive. You have to think, $35 per 90 cartridge, I can go through that in a week, which comes about to be $140 per month on just cartridges. I'm sorry, but for that price I'd rather just wash my face and deal with the zits."
2,I didn't notice a thing...,"I felt that I fell within the criteria that this product claims it will work for and after a few weeks of playing with it, I can really say I didn't notice a difference and won't be purchasing refills or recommending this. It simply didn't make a difference for myself or for a couple other people that tried it. I think the industry needs something external like this, but I feel this one misses the mark.I give it stars at all because it is easy to use, compact, and has an elegant design. :)"
1,90 Count Cartridge only lasted for 12 uses.,"The product does work, however the 90 count cartridge that came with the device only worked for 12 or so uses. Very disappointed. I should have purchased it in the regular store; I would have had better luck with it working like it said. I wonder how long the product was on the shelf when it was sold to me? And, how the life of the product declines when inactive?"
1,Not so effective,"Although many reviews said that this product was effective, it did not work at all for me. In some places it actually made my acne worse. i did return the product and receive the full refund. I decided to go to a dermatologist, who prescribed medication for me that has been much more effective that any treatment that I have tried. My advice is, before you purchase 'miracle' products consider going to a dermatologist. They are usually covered by insurance but if you do not have insurance the visit charge is about $50, and the Rx is about $25 with rebates that can make them 0."
1,stops working,"I liked it when I first got it. Then in less than a year it just will not charge. I only used it a few times. Nothing happens, no lights, nothing blinks when I plug it in. I tried different outlets. Luckily I bought 2 and so, a year and a half later I opened the second one I had, brand new.I plugged it in and NOTHING happened, it will not charge, doesn't work. I spent over $165, what a waste of money. It was not exposed to humidity, kept in a dry closet, constant temp. It is a gamble if it works and charges on, then it helps the acne. If it does not charge or turn on, then it is a just a pretty pink paper weight. Wonder if I could sell the tip, anyone interested?"
1,Not for cystic acne,"You hear a lot of mixed reviews regarding zeno, and personally, it did was not effective for my skin condition. The product's insert DOES disclaim that it is not effective for severe acne in the form of cystic acne so I can't exactly be surprised by the outcome. Still, since a lot of ppl claim that it worked for them, I tried it for a month. I used the device right whenever I felt a zit forming, but to my disappointment I'd still get the breakout."
1,"Not useful, definitely not worth the money!","I used this product for a month and saw no good results. I get big red pimples around my mouth from smoking and was hoping this product would help. I didn't. It ended up in the closet and not ever being used. I took it out recently to try it again, but it is broken, it won't charge, turn on, anything, it's only a year and a half old! Oh well, a super waste of money :( and it was almost $200 when I bought it!"
4,get the part started,"good jam teddy riley, blackstreet, dr. dre and introducing queenpen you could'nt miss here even got a little gospel in it, 2pac claims dre stole his beats and gave them to east coast artists well truth be told 2pac sampled himself and this song samples bill withers old hit grandmas' hand."
3,Interesting but boring.,"I don't remember where I got this book from but it was during a time when I was absorbing as much gonzo journalism as possible. This biography of H.S.T. is well written and would be perfect if one were looking for a balanced profile of the enigma that was Hunter S. Thompson but unfortunately I had just readThe Proud Highway: Saga of a Desperate Southern Gentleman, 1955-1967which is a collection of letters he wrote. I thought that the letters, which are addressed to everyone from his mother and girlfriends to bill collectors and colleagues, painted a much better picture of H.S.T.'s early life and times. It also gives so much more insight into Thompson's mind that after reading it I didn't feel the need to read another bio. If you have to choose one I wouldn't recommend reading this biography."
4,"Much better than ""When The Going Gets Weird""","I bought this because I am a rabid HST fan and although I knew most of the events in the book, I was surprised that he sometimes physically abused the women in his life. Hunter was from a totally different planet. If you want to scarf everything down by HST, I'd buy it!"
4,A realistic view of an unreal person,"As far as I am concerned, this book tells Hunter's life as it is. Great childhood material and an especially good section about the author working with Dr. Gonzo on -- of all things -- an article about the Honolulu Marathon."
5,Forget the rest this is the Botox bible!,"Dr. Kane conveys his vast knowledge of everything to do with botox with such clarity that upon completeing the book the reader has every question answered. Being a public speaker, I know that a person understands a subject top the extent to which they can teach it. Dr. Kane has been a student of ""His"" breakthrough process for over a decade and you will agree that there isn't anyone on the planet who knows more about Botox. There are more books and information coming out everyday by people who are trying to cash in on this rapidly growing field but make sure you read this one! Some people like to read books by skipping around. I think it's best to let Dr. Kane take you through step by step his way, so you can truly benefit from his expertise. I'm sure you will agree, even if you aren't planning on using Botox, it's a fascinating read!"
5,The Best Botox Book You'll Ever Read,This book explains it all. It sorts out all the bits and pieces one has heard about this wonderful new technique. A technique which enables us to at least slow down the aging clock if not turn it back just a subtle bit at a time! I now feel confident enough to make that phone call to Dr. Kane and get started! Thank you Dr.Kane!
5,"A Beautiful ""Lady"" From London...","Oh, the first time I heard this delightful and witty score was the old CBS Rise Stevens recording. The use of three mini-musicals within the play seemed a wonderful and stagey way of playing with our ""dreams."" Certainly some of the music may seem dated, but the over-all effect is still charming. I did catch the Encore's production, some years ago, in New York and fell in love with the show all over again. I waited for the album, it didn't come. Then this excellent British production came along and with its original orchestrations. I think it's great! The cast is excellent and the whole album is fresh and funny. ""Lady in the Dark"" is one our first great modern musicals."
5,A Good Show,"This London casting is good, which makes the recording also good. It is nice to have a lot of the score to listen to as it is played and sung with a freshness that doesn't make the musical sound dated."
3,lacking,"yes, this collection has the 12 inches of fly robin fly & get up & boogie, but what about spend the night with me, dancing in the aisle, & penny mclean lady bump & linda thompson ooh what a night? the only advantage that this version has from the unidisc greatest hits is that it has the 12"" version of telegram, blame it on the music & san francisco hustle. so you really need to buy both of them."
4,It's cute..,"This carry case is small, but cute. I recieved this from the manufacturer very quickly, with no problems.I haven't yet recieved my Gameboy Advance i ordered yet, but i'll let you all know when i do.. and how it fits in there.. lol."
5,informative and educational,"This is a great book for those who want to have an overall view of the metaphysical world. It explains clearly and puts together many aspects that I would otherwise have to read in several other books and sources. This is a book for someone who is skeptical about everything intangible, esoterics and spirituality. It makes sense of a lot of things and is a good referral book to have in my library to come back to again and again. The practical exercises are easy to follow and extremely helpful in many ways. I recommend this book highly to all those who are interested in expanding their general knowledge self development, self growth and expansion in consciousness. I think every manager should read this book."
4,Great Stuff!,"Jack Bruce. Kind of an 'odd man out' - never in the mainstream; that's for sure. I hesitated before buying this one. I did and am glad I did (I'm so Glad).I have yet to fully involve myself with the CD. This is a good sign. It indicates the music contains more to investigate.My recomendation is simple. One of my all time favourites has been West, Bruce, Laing's ""I'm Into The Fields"". Buy the CD for that reason. It's the first track. If you hate the rest of the CD you will still have your money's worth.If you are shopping, you could do a lot worse than this. Bruce is a first rate musician and keeps company with the best!"
1,PH Sport Sunglasses,I bought these sport glasses for road cycle racing. They say they are photchromatic but they are slightly grey and stay that way no matter how bright the sun is. I'm certain they have no photochromatic properties. They are good for indoor use (laugh) and on cloudy days only. Buyer beware; just another cheap set of platic glasses-go to Wal-mart and spend the $5 instead of the $99.....
2,The price is the only thing to like,"Compared to the Season brand sardines that are packed in water, these fish are scrawnier, have 4x the sodium, & aren't as densely packed. They cost less than Season brand, but even so, I think I'm going back."

4,Happy husband,Gave this to my Husband for Christmas and he was happy with it. What else do you want me to say
4,When Country was'nt cool.,"Brings back memories of when I did more rocking than anything else.Exile and Restless Heart, Sawyer Brown, Alabama, CDB, along with a host of others led me to appreciate the music that my father had played all during my childhood. Merle, Conway, Charlie, George, and of course the second George. Strait that is. I have an appreciation of everything from Acuff to Zeppelin. That's my story and I'm sticking to it."
2,Not even demo quality,"One very good song and the rest is truly Ted solo, just his voice and guitar. The songs are very good, and there's nothing wrong with a man singing solo with only his guitar to accompany him, but geez, would a LITTLE production value hurt? The sonics are really awful on this CD, and the recordings are not even up to demo level. This ep could easily be a 4 star CD if Ted would have taken the time to record the solo songs in a professional setting instead of what sounds like a cheap cassette recorder in his bedroom."
4,Nice,"Great little EP, mostly Ted Leo and his electric guitar singing out some good, emotional catchy ditties. Pretty good stuff, if you don't mind sparse instrumental backing. Great songs, I'd love to hear them backed by a full band."
5,Ted Leo is God,Singer and songwriter shine here. Better than Tyrrany of Distance. If you like this then buy Shake the Sheets
4,Missing Goop,All the parts came but no install instructions and no goop to seal the places where screws were used. Leaks more than ever until I can get the goop.
3,I do not own this,"So I cannot evaluate it, I just want to remove it from my review list.It is an old device anyway."
1,HELP!!!,"I purchased this system for my husband for christmas ----CHRISTMAS WAS 7 DAYS AGO and I still do not have this thing up and running. I can honestly say that I'm pretty advanced when it comes to computers, however I prefer macs. I do have a PC, but it only has windows 98 system software, however the magellan roadmate gps 500 claims to be compatable with this. I can not get the computer to recognize the gps system because it is asking me for a driver for it. The system does not come with any drivers. The magellan gps web site is USELESS and I have called customer support 3 times in the last 7 days and have only been transfered to voicemail with no call back (they claim to return calls within the 24 hours.) VERY FRUSTRATED and if I can find a way or a computer to upload this map data, this system will be going back to amazon.com"
2,Initial Set up,"The unit requires registration and an authorization number from the manufacture before maps can be loaded into the compact flash card. This requires determining the CF card ID when registering. Instructions for this procedure are very poor and navigating Magellan's web site is tricky at best. If you enter the CF ID incorrectly, you cannot store any maps in the unit even if you are provided an authorization code for the CF card. Beware!"
5,Fantastic System!,"I am delighted with this system, and would recommend it highly to those who are tired of being constantly lost. Magellan also makes a more expensive system with a hard disk that holds maps for the entire U.S. In the case of this model(the Roadmate 500) you have to download the maps you want from a CD. Unless you travel constantly all over the country, the model 700 is a waste of money because all the other features are the same. The unit could not be easier to use, and the screen is bright and easily visible. I only have two gripes: first, the documentation accompanying the unit needs to be clearer and more detailed. Secondly, the mickey-mouse mounting bracket that comes with the unit is totally useless. It is designed to slide into an A/C vent. Magellan can surely do better than this! Other that those two observations, I would recommend the Roadmate 500 highly."
1,mr.serv on no more questions,you should never be disappointed in a 94 cent purchase but this will do it
4,Great for imagination,"My grandson loves this as he is such a Mario & Luigi fan however I have had to restitch a seam on the side as well as the straps on Marios overalls. Reinforced stiching would have been better for a toy that gets played with each & every day. Other than that, my grandson uses his imagination for play & really enjoys this 'doll' as well as the Luigi doll."
2,Disappointed,"I was surprised at the quality of this item. I had expected this to be a ""plush"" toy as noted on the website. However, it is actually rather cheaply made. It looks like those toys you get out of the ""claw"" machine. I also ordered the Mario and Donkey Kong toys and they were the same. My 6 year will not care because he loves the Nintendo characters. However, I wish they were a little nicer."
3,"Nice, but not too durable.....","This is one of the few plush Luigi dolls out there, and its reasonably priced, but you DO get what you pay for. I bought this for my 8-year old son (a Mario Bros. addict), and after about 2 days of play (not rough play, by any definition), his hat emblem was peeling and the lone stitch holding down each sideburn had broken loose. The mustache is only held by one stitch on each side, too, so I'm anticipating a problem there soon. We're working on fixing them more permanently, and my son still loves it, so it was $7.00 well spent regardless."
2,A bit disappointing,"I got this for my gamer boyfriend for Christmas. I thought it would make a cute gift because he's tall, lanky and when he has a mustache, he sort of resembles Luigi. That, and he just loves collecting anime or video game-type toys.However, the stitching was very poor. It was very loose and looked like a person learning how to sew had stitched it together. It probably will be okay - my boyfriend doesn't play with plushies and the toy will most likely just sit on a shelf.I wouldn't recommend this for a child that will drag it around and play rough with it. I'd guess it would fall apart very easily."
1,His eyes and Hat started to peel of in 10 minutes,Cute got it for my 7 year old for Christmas his eyes started to crack in 10 minutes and by the end of the day were all gone and so was the L on the hat. Very disappointed!!!!!
2,Doesn't hold up well,"Within days of receiving this doll, the neck seam unraveled and had to be hand-sewn back together, and the mustache fell off, requiring fabric glue to reattach it. Not worth the money spent."
4,Fun with Luigi,"I bought this toy for my 3 year old grandson. He is a big Mario Brothers fan and he really loved it. This plush doll is just the right size, not too big or too small. It is the perfect size for him to carry around to play with and as a sleeping buddy."
5,It works ... cheaper than a plumber and safer than chemicals,"I remember having a small bit of Drano splash onto me when I was younger. Just a few drops, but it burned like crazy.So, there's no way I'm using it in MY bathtub/shower where my bare feet and other precious body parts go.I like to keep the drain flowing freely in the tub. That way, you don't get soap rings and other nasty buildups, and there's less cleaning to do."
4,Not in the uK,Arrived very quickly especially as it was shipped from the USA to the UK. Unfortunately our drain holes here have a different construction than those that this great little tool was designed for. I was unable to fit it down one drain hole because of the sharp u-turn in the pipe below. The drain from the bath is protected by an integral metal grille which would have to be unscrewed to use this tool sucessfully. i was able to insert it but not to pull it out as the muck encrusted plastic became too bulky to fit back through the grille. Drat! I'm still giving it 4 stars though because it undoubtably does exactly what it says - you just need to be sure that your bath plug system suits it.
2,Not for all type of drains,"I was very excited seeing the results of this product on YouTube. I am hoping this will take care of my drainage problem for at least a few years. So I don't have to dump chemicals down my drain and into to ocean every 6 months. The reality is, it doesn't go all the way in my bath tub drain, only 1/3 of it got in. And it didn't remove a thing. I tried it from the trap hole. I spent over 30 mins and nothing came out! I live in a city apartment. I guess you can try with a wire hanger and see if you can push something down your drain first before you buy this item.I wish they will mark the page with ""May not work with all drains"""
1,???,"I don't know who is writing the reviews for this product, but my best guess is that it is the marketing department for this product. Kudos to you, marketing department. You got me.To everybody else, save your $3. Honestly, it is not even worth that. I'm pretty sure if I removed all of the hair from my head and placed it in my bathroom drain, this product would still not remove anything from the drain. I can see the clog in my drain, and the amazing ""Zip It"" is still incapable of removing ANYTHING."
2,It didn't pull up anything,"I did not have problems with my drains but had heard that the Zip-It could pull up a lot of hair and crud from drains. I bought one and used it on the bath tub's drain, the bathroom sink, and the kitchen sink. I got a very tiny amount of brown detritus, but nothing significant. There was not a single hair on the Zip-It. Perhaps I just have unusually clean drains."
1,Total Waste of Money,"It simply doesn't work and I should have known better than to try. If you're also desperate, call a plumber and let not buying this pay for part of the bill."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,Just go to the store and buy some Drano--chances are that's what you're going to end up doing anyway.
1,completely useless,"A complete waste of money. A toothpick would work just as well. The image in the advertisement was hardly distinguishable, and it provided no detail on length."
3,"Nice idea, did not work in my circumstance","My bathtub and sink drains have been running progressively more slowly over the last few months. Usually I'm able to free things up with a well-bent coat-hanger, but I wasn't able to get the clog out that way. Before turning to a harsh chemical drain cleaner I tried the Cobra Zip-It, to pretty much no avail.I got a few hairs but really no clumps of stuff out. I guess whatever's down there is either further than 17"" down the pipe, or not clumpy enough to get pulled out in a bunch.However I'm still giving this 3-stars because A) it was cheap and B) I think it would work for a lot of people (as evidenced by the other reviews.) Try it out, just don't expect it to necessarily solve your problem."
2,I was prepared to be amazed,My drain was slow and I tried this out. It didn't get nearly as much hair out as I thought. I ended up using a screwdriver and paperclips (and my fingers) to clear it out eventually.
2,Didn't work for me,"Maybe I didn't have the type of clog this works on, but this actually made my drain problem even worse. Instead of just a slowly draining sink,I think the Cobra jammed the clog down the pipe and completely stopped up the drain so it didn't drain at all. I had to get the maintenance staff to use a heavy duty snake to clear it out in the end. I'll try it again on a less severe clog, as I bought three, but it was not a wonder cure all for me."
3,"I'm sure it's a great product, but...","Please make sure you examine your drains before you buy it. I bought this for my brand new apartment and I soon discovered that the drains and the pipe are not compatible. Like I said, I've heard it works wonders but please be mindful of your drain shape before buying."
5,Awesome little gadget!,Easy and effective for unclogging a slow-running bathroom sink drain! It took me longer to open the package than it did to unclog the drain. Highly recommended for any DIYer's arsenal.
1,Did not work for me,"This may work for other people but it was useless on my drains. It was nearly impossible to cram it down any drain, I could only get it partially down. It was also nearly impossible to remove it and I thought I would have to call a plumber to get the thing out. It did nothing at all. It was a struggle to get it in and a struggle to remove it. Also, it has VERY sharp prongs on both sides so there is nothing to grab onto. Total waste of money and time in my case."
4,It works ...and it's cheap!,"Just got one at Wal-mart today for $2.24. I was sick of the slow drains in our bathroom sink and tub. I pulled up 4 or 5 clumps of gunky hair in about 5 minutes. Works great! I think it could be a little sturdier to push through the clog though. Bends a little too easily at times, but not enough to make it useless. For the price, you can't beat it. Saves you tons of money over those liquid drain openers that don't even work!!! Give it a try!"
1,Worthless (at least for me),It simply did not work for me. Why? I don't know. I followed the instructions clearly. If I had a mini camera I would look in the drain and find out what the stinking problem is but I don't. Maybe apartment drains are different than house drains? I don't know.
2,Dont waste your money. Get a snake.,Bought this thinking it would be a cheap alternitive to a snake. It is just that! In every way. It sorta works but not very well.
4,Found to be effective on first use.,"I have to clean out the drain in our bathroom sink at least once a year. A lot of the things my wife uses -- cold creams, special facial soaps, etc. -- tend to combine with stray hairs and other debris to produce clogs. Generally when I notice that the sink is draining very slow, I have to go in through the p-trap -- unscrewing the arm to the drain valve mechanism -- so that I can take entire drain valve out. Then I typically remove the ""gunk"" using needle nose plier or surgical forceps. So I tried the Zip-It tool in hopes of saving me some trouble. It did get a lot of stuff out, and the drain is flowing good again. I'm not sure it got as much out as I would have with my usual routine, but for the ease of use and labor savings I'll be happy to use the Zip-It on a more frequent basis if that's what it takes."
2,Drain cleaning tool,"I was surprised to see how long this item was, plus it was a one-time only use item. This was not indicated anywhere in the descriptions of the object before I decided to buy. I did use it, and, either the drain wasn't clogged enough, or the tool missed the clog."
5,This thing rocks!!!,With a house full of girls/women the drains in my home can get pretty clogged. This tool makes short work of an otherwise lengthy process and can be used more often. Keeps everything flowing.
5,Great idea,I read about this product in Handyman magazine and liked the idea. It looks long and stiff enough to use in all the bathroom drains. My experience has been that hair is always the problem causing stopped up drains in the bathroom and I feel certain this design will snag the hair and pull it out. The directions say to use it once and throw away. I see no reason to do this. You should be able to use it over and over. I would much rather remove the clog this way than by using chemicals or a plunger.
5,This thing is great!,"I have long hair, so I am always clogging up the drains. This thing zips right in and after a few passes, the drainage is clear. No nasty chemicals to worry about, and you can use it over and over. It's a must-have for anyone with long hair!"
5,Excellent value,Magical. Had used the drain cleaner liquid several times but they did not work. This one worked like a charm. Highly recommended.
2,Didn't work for me,For me this didn't work. I tried it in my bathroom wash basin and it removed hardly ten percent of debris. The ragged edges are sort of sharp too. Will not recommend. I eventually bought a drum auger to do the job and it worked.
2,Hard To Operate,"This might be a good tool, but I had a very hard time trying to use it to clear a tough clog that was a bit far. Although it is long, it became hard to control the wire after a certain distance. My hands got sore trying to push it in, and it was hard to control the wire outside or inside the coil. Finally I gave up.A few days later I bought a ""Cobra Products 650 Air Drain Blaster"" form a nearby store. Although I saw it on Amazon I was not convinced of its effectiveness. But now that not much was left to try I bought it and it did the job much much much (I can go on forever) easier than this Cobra Metal Drain Clearing Drum Auger."
2,Works - But not for me!,"I have read some great reviews for this item, so I bought it. It did not work on my drain. I got maybe one strand of hair out with this, but other than that it was pretty worthless. However, it did work on my sister's drain, and it worked rather well for her. I think it has something to do with it not being quite long enough to reach the clog in my drain. I would not buy this tool, as you can go to Home Depot and get a tool for you to keep which will be reusable, and will reach a deep clog for about look for a brass craft for $7. Good luck!"
3,"Snake for sticky ""hairballs"" down a drain","It does pick up ""hairballs"" from your sink pretty well. It does not want to go down or out easy due to sharper edges. I found myself using a retractable snake bought at my supermarket for under $5 with much ""smoother teeth."" It is easier to get in/out of a drain, it does clear it, but ""push-through"" than take out than the above reviewed snake does."
3,"Did the job, sort off.","This product did the trick, but not after a bit of a struggle to stick the tool into my drain. Its not as flexible to properly curl down the pipes to get to the root of the problem without using force to push it in. Even after getting it in to the drain, getting it out is actually more work. I tried using this tool on different drains and all have the same problem. The non flexibility of the tool does make it harder to use. But after using force and pulling and pushing, my sink was unclogged but the spikes on the tool are pretty much toast.Based on how long/time you use this, its pretty much a use once or twice tool and you throw it out after. Not sure its worth the price in a sense but its better than paying $50+ for a plumber to do the same job for you!"
5,this thing works!,"I'm constantly battling my clogged bathtub, and i have to say this thing is great at cleaning out hair and shampoo goobs. I live in an old building so, I have to clean it out ever so often but I find that this works much much better than the dreaded TOXIC draino stuff and even better than your standard snake. Def try it i mean what do you have to lose."
1,Did not work for my drain,"My home was built in 2005, and has a type of drain that will not work with this tool. I could only get about 1/2 an inch down the drain, then it got stuck and the drain wasn't shaped right to fit it in further for me. I'll need a different solution."
5,Works better than $20 worth of strong chemicals & safer than power tools!!,"I did not want to use my rarely-used powered auger/snake on my fiberglass jacuzzi tub (afraid I might chip the fiberglass if I did not do a perfectly steady, even insertion, turning and removal). After using several of the usual strong chemicals on my jacuzzi tub drain, with little improvement, I tried the ZipIt. Not only did it pull up the disgusting hair clumps, it brought a small, mystery piece of packaging plastic that was somehow lodged in the drain. The reviewer that said ""insert, then turn"" had the best advice of all. Turning it after inserting all the way made all the difference. Did it a couple of times and everything drains perfect. Buy it!! Keep one on hand-- you will need it one day."
5,Great for hair in bathroom drains,"This little tool does a great job at pulling hair clogs out of the drains in bathroom lavs (wash basins). It's the only tool that doesn't require you to disassemble the drain plug, and doesn't require harsh chemicals.It cleans easily (use a kleenex to pull the hair off the teeth, taking care not to stick yourself) and can be reused. However, after several uses, you'll notice that the plastic teeth are wearing off. Then it's time to toss it.We like this item so much that we are buying the bargain 12-pack and putting them beneath each sink for ready access."
2,Zip-It is a Rip-Off,"Zip-it probably is only good when U-tube is near the bottom of the wash basin. If it's located further down, Zipit can't reach it.I tried snaking and plunging, but to no avail. Liquid Plumber only clogged it more. The only thing that finally opened the drain was sulphuric acid. It' dangerous to use, so be careful; otherwise, call a professional plumber."
1,Did not work for me,Had issues with my sink drain this simply did not help one bit.I think if they make this item longer in size it might of helped
1,Worthless,Don't bother with this item. Save your money. Just stick with a plunger or a real snake. Or hire a plumber.
2,product quality,"it is impossible to cram it down any drain, I could only get it partially down. It was also nearly impossible to remove it and I thought I would have to call a plumber to get the thing out. It did nothing at all. It was a struggle to get it in and a struggle to remove it."
5,"Oh man, was the drain dirty.","There was so much gunk in the drain. Jesus christ, it was horrifying. And the smell... There was more hair down there than on the floor of a barber shop."
5,WONDERFUL,I ordered this item after seeing a commercial for turbo snake and found zip-it at half the price even with shipping. I had a bathroom drain running clear for the first time in over 2 years and the gunk that came out was amazing...I then went on to the tub which was just a little slow with the same amazing results...I highly recommend this product.Tana
1,Tried it but...,I tried it on my tub drain but my drain has two reversing L-shapes in a short distance and it would not get past the second elbow without some serious force being used. Figured better safe than sorry with a broken Zip-It adding to the congestion down there so I gave up
1,didn't work,it didn't work for me. my sinks are angled and it wouldn't go down. basically useless waste of money. that's all
1,18 inches of thin plastic won't do the job,"I should have known. It looks more like a zip tie for garbage bags than something that could unclog a drain. It was only 18 inches, so I'm not even sure it reached the clog. When I used the handle to rotate inside the pipe, it got twisted and started bending. When I pulled it out, it was almost unusable and all bent up without any debris from the pipe. This is definitely a light duty tool, that should have had 3 or more in the pack. I bought this at a store that didn't have any other options. If there were a true plumber's snake or auger there, I definitely would have bought that instead. Buy the real deal with at least 5 feet of metal with some heft behind it."
3,Definitely disposable,"This thing is much longer than it looks, at least a couple feet. It does an okay job on hair clogs, won't work at all on any other type of clog. It is one time use only and the little barbs will break off, so you definitely can only use it once.I would not buy this again."
5,The best investment you'll ever make!,"I did not buy my ""zip-it"" on Amazon but I'm glad to see them available here because mine is wearing out. I do not throw mine out after each use, I rinse it under water to get the slimy soap out of the hair so I can pull it loose and then I rinse the zip-it in bleach water. We clean our shower and bathroom sink drains with this on the first of every month and follow the clean out with vinegar to cut any greasy residue. (Hey if you let hair and soap scum accumulate for several months in your drains, you probably deserve the expense of a plumber). 18"" of sturdy barbed plastic, slide it down, twist it and pull it up, rinse under water to remove soap slime as you remove the hair from the barbs... Repeat until it grabs no hair. Wear gloves, it brings up slimey, icky stuff, but it really cleans the hair (and little razor covers out of the drain). What I pull out of our drain on a regular basis makes me wonder why we are not bald. Seriously, a great product!"
3,Nope.,"Didn't work for me. Clearly it would work in certain situations. As it was only a few dollars, I am glad I tried it (and tried it, and tried it) before calling the plumber."
5,Very easy and fast to use,With having very long hair this thing is a life saver! My drain gets clogged all the time. I've never used one before took me two seconds to figure out and clear the drain. For the price you can't beat it.
2,Misleading,"The packaging for this product features illustrations that are misleading. The Zip-It is shown being pushed down a sink drain, with the pop-up stopper still in place. This is how I used the Zip-It too. I really hate unscrewing the pop-up stoppers in my sinks, because they are all old and balky.I duly pushed my new Zip-It into my drain. It promptly got stuck. I had to unscrew and remove the blasted pop-up stopper anyway, in order to free the Zip-It. If you are going to remove your pop-up stopper, you might as well use a bent shirt hanger. It's cheaper than a Zip-It and works almost as well."
5,Worth EVERY Penny,I've used plenty of chemical and natural solutions to clear our bathroom sink's drain but this was by far the best!
2,"Zip it, failed","Just got my Zip It with high hopes that FINALLY the drain in my sink would be moving again. But my dreams of having flowing water moving down the pipes were dashed! After getting the Zip it down the drain rather easily, pulling it back slowly as directed, nothing came up. Nada, nothing. OH, maybe a tiny speck, spot ( and I mean tiny) of dark grease but nothing else. So I tried again and again, but...nada! At least I didn't pay an arm and a leg for it. So now I'll be off to buy what another poster suggested; ""Power Hair and Grease drain cleaner"" by Scotch. I am so disappointed. Whaaawhaaawhaaa!"
1,Only works with Toshiba projectors?,"Bought one, and when hooked up to my Epson Powerlite 765c the camera would show for 5 seconds or so, and then black out. Could reproduce that every time powering up the Toshiba - a few seconds on, then off. Figured it was defective - sent that one back - replacement does the exact same thing. Was reading through the sparse manual and found a little blurb that mentioned that it would only work with a Toshiba projector. No clue why - these things are just webcams on an arm with adjustments... but returning the replacement as well."
4,Great for the Price!,"Pros: These are a hit at the college I work for. The image is great for the price, they're relatively inexpensive, they're so easy to set up, they're so easy to use, and they're lightweight.Cons: We have more than ten of these, and two have broken within the first year. It could be that we work them hard, or it could be that they just break easily.Also, these units are set by default to eventually not work with non-Toshiba products. This might become apparent the first time you use it, or six months down the line. One day, you turn it on, it shows the image for a few seconds, then shows nothing. Toshiba practically hides the information for how to undo this setting, so I'll tell you right now:Turn on the unit, then press-and-hold the ZOOM ""-"" key and the down arrow key at the same time for three seconds. *TRY THIS BEFORE THROWING YOUR UNIT AWAY!*"
2,Great idea but...,This was the best birthday present I have received until it died several days after the warranty expiration. I did the work around for the non-Toshiba projectors (weird thinking on the part of the engineers). As long as it lasts it is excellent. Have replaced it with a much smaller Epson with auto focus (most of the time) but no light. Low end of the market these are good values for presenters.
3,Ok,The firs song rappers delight is an awesome song. The rest of the songs are cheasy and not good at all.
1,Very little for the money,"What do you get for $29.95 plus about $7.50 shipping?? Not much!! This knife comes in a cheap plastic cigar tube and it is not even sharpened ready to use. In fact, the one I got was sharpened like my lawn mower blade and it took me quite a while to get the correct angle and to get it sharp enough to use. You would think at the premium price you are paying for this it would come in a decent case and be expertly sharpened. Look at it closely....is it really worth $30?? You can get a whole set of quality cuttlery for what this little knife costs. They get you for the shipping too because that should be around $4.50 or so. Not worth the price !!"
4,Nice but...,"This is great in that it is in color. The catch 22 is that it eats batteries. I have this and a Garmin model Emap. The color is a great feature. But to help get the most out of it you do need the CD's with the added features for maps. The confusing part is the instructions on setting up waypoints. The best deal is play with it till you get familiar with it. You can't break it by playing with it. I would give it five stars but the battery eating is really bad, have plenty of AA batteries if you use this on a trip."
1,never buy magellan again,software is way over priced and doesnt include updates...very hard to link to computer....very poor customer support.....and dont try to find any upgrades or q&a on any product that is last years
1,YUCK!!!,"The other customer who gave such a short review must have been a friend of this author.This book is terrible. Honey..Rosebud...Honey....Rosebud...Honey...Honey...Honey.Can't the hero call the heroine by her name, just once, when their together?I can't finish this book simply because of this! Good grief, I'm only at 27% on my Kindle and I bet the word Honey has already been used 25 times, if not more.Why didn't the author just name her Honey? It would have made the book worth finishing. Pet names are OK to a point but Come'on.The story line might have had possibilites if it weren't for HONEY!"
3,"Fun way to prep for test, kinda cheesy","I used this for my middle schoolers around test-prep time. It's a good refresher of test taking skills. It is geared toward elementary school aged children, but I think that even 3rd graders would find it cheesy. I just warn my kids ahead of time that it is very silly but has good information. One of them told me that because it was ""so lame"" he actually remembered parts of it because they made fun of it. Whatever works!"
1,Wrong Book,They sent the wrong book and I havent had the chance to try to get the right one It is one of those deals where they needed to get it wright the first time
1,DVD did not work.,This DVD was received in good shape but did not work when I received it and tried to play it. Very disappointed and so too are my kids.
3,Not Bad...,"Gamma Ray's album, No World Order, might perhaps be their best! This is the first single off of their album. The single, ""Heaven Or Hell"", is pretty good and is a bit catchy. They also cover Thin Lizzy's ""Angel Of Death"", which is not available on the album. But this single is definitely not worth the ...!! I actually got mine for free as an English promo cd single! I recommend to save that money for the actual album, which will not disappoint!!"
2,did not work,"I attempted to drive compatable nails into my basement floor and they would not penetrate more than 1/2"". In some cases they just shattered the concrete with the nail not embedding in the concrete at all. I started with the green loads, then yellow and finally the most powerful (red) and had no luck. Thinking that there was something strange about my basement floor, I test-fired into the footings for my deck and had similar results. I also tried a much more expensive tool like this with different loads and it did not work either. I ended up drilling into the concrete (with a hammer drill) and using another type of anchor and had no trouble. Perhaps it works better on fresh concrete that is not fully cured."
2,Terrible Product,"Everything was shipped perfectly and on time, it was just the product that sucked. It's not all that loud, and it's super cheesey. One thing, there is nothing blocking the button that discharges the air to make the screech, so it can easily go off in a purse, pocket, bag, etc.It's easier and louder just to scream if you're being attacked, and if you do feel you need something like this, get an electronic version that doesn't have a limit on usage other than battery life."
5,Great Product!,"I did a quick, and very quick test since their is an estimated 20 bursts in it. It is loud, but not like an air horn. It has the sound of a super-sonic screeching, screaming firework noise. I would definitely trust it to deter someone following me, trying to mug me, threatening me, etc.! It's a great product, and a must-have! If your child is being bullied, cornered, or threatened at school, it's small enough to slip in a pocket.. and would definitely scare-off bullies!! Thanks for a great purchase and product!!((:"
3,"Nice, but not great","I had been looking for Spem in Alium and other works by Tallis and composers of his time. I have to say I was only moderately happy with this disc. It does not compare favorably, to my ear, to what I regard as the current ""gold standard"" set by the group Stile Antico. Their work with other Tallis pieces (e.g. in Puer Natus Est) brings out a level of sheer beauty in Tallis's work that is not present in this CD."
3,"Disappointing and rushed writing/editing, but good story","I just finished this book, one of many from Cassie Edwards that I have read and frankly, I was disappointed. While the story line was excellent, it seemed like it was written by an 8th grader. Maybe it was rushed, either way the repetitive use of ""murmured"" was just frustrating. Does Kathia never 'talk' or 'speak'? Does she just murmur all the time? Come on. The writing was just awful and if it wasn't for the passionate story, I would have quit reading in chapter 6. The last name Parrish (Parish?) changes spelling several times in the book too. The hymen line was little far fetched, the story could have done without that. If you read this book, read it for the story, not the editing."
4,Classic Monster in a Modern Tale.,"Scooby and the gang are off to a famous wax museum for a private demonstration of how wax figures are made. The statues look so life-like they could be real. But as Scooby and Shaggy find out, some of them maybe real, as they are chased through the building by Frankenstein's monster, who seems to be after a valuable necklace. The rest of the gang have a hunch things aren't what they appear to be and the stage is set for a showdown between a classic horror creature and a beloved cartoony dog.Except for the fact that, well, the monster wasn't exactly who he was, this story reminded me of some of the old Abbot and Costello monster movies. The book is easy to read and is a delight for kids and any Scooby-Doo fan."
4,Great Photographs,"A large format book with hundreds of quality photos of Kleist's 1st Panzer Army in the Soviet Union from June-December, 1941. The photos are clear large format and show vehicles, uniforms and equipment. There are also sections of unit commanders and Knight Cross winners. The text is FRENCH ONLY (which kept it from being 5 stars) but the photos and tactical maps speak for themselves."
4,Budd stripped down,"Forty minutes of Harold Budd's piano skills, without additives. All the trademark Budd motifs are here: the rolling melodies, the repetitions, the use of silence, and the warm romanticism at the heart of all he does. Recorded on a beautifully toned Steinway by Daniel Lanois no less, he who breathed new life into Bob Dylan's faltering output. This is a lustrous and richly melodic collection of piano pieces, so why am I giving it only 4 stars? Simply this: I miss the extra magic and mystery from the special effects (delays, overdubs etc.) Harold adds when he's in the studio. Still a recommended purchase. Perhaps I'm a bit of a puritan, but the only solo piano I can manage is either Phillip Glass Solo Piano or Keith Jarrett The Koln Concert: 24 January 1975"
2,Too many tiny pieces,I purchased this product as a Christmas gift for my 11 year old daughter as she loves crafts. The magnets are too small and not very sturdy or heavy. It is quite tedious to design something or to follow the designs provided in the kit. There is no easy way to keep track of the tiles so we ended up putting each color in a baggie but they are not easy to get out of the baggies once they are in there. They are so small it is very difficult not to lose them and very easy to vacuum them up. The box showed many more designs than are provided and of course my daughter wanted to make one of the designs for which there was no provided key. We tried counting tiles from the picture on the box but it was too difficult for her. Overall it is somewhat fun but not the hit I had hoped and not something she seems to be picking up and using over and over again.
2,body paint without the bodies,"I thought the video would be more tantalizing than the print issue. WRONG!! Yes, there are the beautiful models in the swim suits, along with the inane dialogue as they tell about what it was like. The body paint segment shows the women, obstacles strategically placed in front of revealing parts, just slightly out of focus or at a distance. Do not buy this tape if you're expecting something ""hot"". Only buy the tape if you are desparate to see their backs in thong bikinis. Don't expect to see nudity."
3,"Dysfunctional, yet admidst it all...","Although it could be argued that this is a story about characters plagued by bad choices and regrets, this still was about a family ultimately caring for one another in individual and unique ways. The main character is not easy to like. It feels like she has given up too easily. The lack of speech a childish prank. Yet somehow, by the end, it all seems to make more sense. I recommend this book because I have learned in my own life that even when you have a broken history with family, it is undeniably valuable. This family helps each other heal via the powerful tool of acceptance.Not compelling, but a relaxing read."
2,Not as good as her first book,"I have read all 3 of Malladi's books. I liked the first one better. The second one ( Mango Season ) was not as good as the first and this third one is not as good as the second. I think there are a couple of grammatical errors. Even with Devi's suicide attempt, her affair ( apparently with her brother-in-law) , miscarriage, temporary muteness, divorce ( of Devi's sister), desperate house-wife ( Devi's mother ) , an ultra modern grandma and recipes like Lamb clitoris , the book fails to impress. To me the story was like a juxtaposition of the above events, with no substance."
5,Crazy but Charming,"Devi decides to kill herself because her life sucks. She survives, saved by her crazy mother and life is not the same for anyone in her family ever again. Devi is forced to live with her parents while she recovers and she becomes silent. She doesn't speak, which really starts to bug her sister and her family. And she starts to cook, crazy food, different from the Indian-Indian food her mother cooks. I loved this book. It was funny, dark, poignant...and very, very tasty."
2,Badly Written Book,"I love South Asian chick-lit. That being said, my collection is quite large and so I feel that I am somewhat of an authority on the genre. This book looked promising, but fails in several areas. The characters are poorly developed and 2-D. The plot (without giving anything away) is badly executed, the climax leaving me wanting to throw the book across the room (I did, and only finished it a month later because I had nothing else to read). The subtheme of food is poorly woven in, adding a confusing layer to already dissapointing cake (or katli). Only read it if you are desperate for any dose of South Asian chick-lit, otherwise, pick up For Matromonial Purposes by Kavita Daswani."
3,Good story,"I enjoyed the story and the characters but found myself increasingly distracted by the badly written dialogue. Too many adverbs telling me how the lines were being said and too many substitutes for the verb said like ""she quipped"" or ""she countered"" or ""she complained."" I would rather discern these things from the lines that are being said and how the character acts while saying them. It also seemed that all of the characters talked the same way (except for the obsenities added to Shoba's lines). The father used expressions like ""go for it"" which did not fit his character and Devi used out of date expressions that seemed more what her parents would say. Maybe I'm being too picky - from looking at the other reviews it seems like others were not bothered by this."
2,CUMMINS THUMBS D OWN,"I WAS DISSAPPOINTD IN QUALITY OF THE ""INDUSTRIAL BATTERY LOAD TESTER"". I USE A ""MELTON LOAD TESTER"" IN MY BUSINESS (HANDICAPPED ELECTRIC SCOOTERS) DAILY AND CANNOT AFFORD TO USE SUCH A LIGHTWEIGHT TESTER. THIS LOOKED AND SOUNDED LIKE THE ""MELTON"" AND I ADMIT THE PRICE WAS ATTRACTIVE. I PURCHASED MY LAST ""MILTON TESTERS"" FOR $29.95 (ON SALE) SO THE PRICE WAS COMPARABLE ,BUT THE QUALITY WAS POOR."
3,students enjoyed this cd,I played this for the students in my early education class and they enjoyed it.
5,Fantastic Game!,"I have had this product for about two months now. This game is not only fun but educational for the whole family.There is interaction with the characters, which I enjoyed. You are sure to improve on reading, math, and deductive reasoning.The story line is great and there is background history throughout the game on the Characters.I can't say enough, You just have to buy it and see for yourself!Eileen NYC."
2,Ugh,"Bought this hoping it would contain the original 12inch single of Catch Me...well, it didn't...."
3,"Oooops ,a mistake!","If you have this razor,you should skip this blade & buy the Titanium blade.Gives a better shave & lasts longer."
5,As Expected!,Product (razors) shipped as expected. Very fast shipping and transaction went smoothly with no problems!
5,very smooth shave..,very smooth shave.great for sensitive skin.does not nick or cut when you start a new blade.lasts a decent amount of time.
1,waste of money,"After using a mach 3 for years I thought this would be a good upgrade, not so much. It easily cuts through facial hair but it becomes hopelessly clogged quickly often after only half a shave. The only way I could clear the clog was to turn on the water full force and put my thumb over the faucet creating a jet of water and spraying it out for 20 or 30 seconds. This is way too much work, especially when I was having to do this 2 or 3 times per shave, more if it had been a few day between shaves.I'm going back to mach 3 after I run out of these..."
5,The best IGT slot sim...,If you're looking for all of your favorite IGT slots they're here. It's just like playing the real thing except you can't reach out and touch the slots. The slots have been faithfully recreated. Buy this game if you love IGT slots...
4,Gambling fun-no loss of money,Hours of entertainment; works beautifully. The tutorials are on target. Speedy arrival and easy installation.
3,stupid design,"The disigners of the game actually are very stupid: though they give you the extra high payout option, you still need millions of play to hit jackpot. But then why put the option there, if not for giving game players easy chance to hit big jackpot? So they do not have a clear idea of what to do when designing the game."
2,Disk required,"No where in the product description does it say that the disk must be in the computer to play this game. That is an unacceptable requirement for me. It should be plainly stated in the product description, then we could make an informed choice."
1,Boring,"This software is NOT Mac capable, in spite of representations that it is. Different modules have to be installed separately to enable different games, generally a pain. Also a pain - you have to leave the CD in the drive to play. If it had been expensive enough to justify the inconvenience, I would have returned it."
3,"If I had to eat a turd, I guess I'd choose the one that stinks the least.","I support two Phaser 6250s, networked, in use by 75 users. I've amazingly never really had a problem with either of them.With all the advances in computers, graphics, software, and hardware... why can't anyone make a printer that works, is easy to use, and won't need every part replaced after a year? And could someone please explain why EVERY printer requires it's own type of toner? Is the 6350 really that much different than the 6250? Why can't I just buy another reliable 6250 instead of chancing a 6350 and having to buy different toner?My belief is that printer technology has not changed in over 20 years, the market is moved by who can create a new toner cartridge that won't fit in anyone else's printer."
1,Nothing but trouble,"I have two xerox phaser printers. The 6250 has been nothing but problems also. It has been returned once and the problem still happens. I get a ""Jam at fuser"" after just a few pages almost every time I print. I have replaced the fuser twice, they are not cheap, on the advise of customer service. Still have the same problem. I googled the error and noticed a ton of other people have the same issue."
2,Sample these non-traditional arrangements,"Be sure to listen to these upbeat, non-traditional arrangements to see if they suit your purpose. The Star-Spangled Banner was nicely done with a traditional arrangement, but the other songs are not what I'm looking for. Listen before you buy."
1,"Safe, chemical free, rubber hose but kinks too easily","I bought this Swan hose because it was tested by HealthyStuff.org and found to be BPA free, chlorine free, and lead free. Unfortunately, on the first attempt to use it the hose kinked so many times that I am returning it. Frustrating that it wasn't actually ""heavy duty"" as in the name."
2,15 foot black hose,I bought this hose because I wanted a black hose that was 15 feet long and was unable to find that length and color combo any where else. It was pricey and nothing special. Hose kinks easily.
2,Dickies work quality?,"The quality isn't there anymore. I wear these for work and get about 6 months of use. The back near the pockets wear out. I heard Dickies has some guarantee, but you have to pay S/H both ways. I basically just drive and sit in a cubicle, so the shorts are not put through any stress. I wear regular cargo shorts which seem to last years doing more strenuous stuff than I do in my work quality Dickies."
2,Poor quality,Bought 2 pair of shorts and received them in about 5 Days. When I received them I noticed that they felt thin. I have been buying Dickies for years. These felt like imitation. Would not recommend.
4,Pretty darn good,"I'm a fairly picky reader and I don't rate very high so this is good. I'll admit part of the thrill for me is all the familiar Cincinnati locations, but it was a fast read and that's a big deal to me. I find many books slow going and that's not enjoyable to me. Its a somewhat predictible story line, but hey what love story isn't. Oh, also, this isn't my normal genre, but a friend suggested the book and they were right to do so. I did enjoy it a lot. Give it a read. You won't be sorry you spent the time."
1,Not What I Expected,"I have the ""Journey of Dreams"" CD by Ladysmith Black Mambazo. It is delightful, swirling, singing music by a group of men from Africa. I liked it so much that I bought another CD ""by"" the same group called the ""Gift of the Tortise. A Musical Journey Through Southern Africa"". Most of it consists of a lady talking- not singing- about the animals, places, and people of Africa. In a couple of places ordinary children are heard singing in the screechy, ordinary way children sing. Every ten minutes or so, a muted male voice sings briefly in the background. There seems to be a big difference between what the producers of this CD consider artistic freedom and what I consider a bait and switch rip off. I threw the CD in the trash."
5,We Love It!!,"I put this on my 19month old daughter's Wish List for Christmas and we just listened to it today. She loved the animal sounds in the beginning and danced to some of the music. It's not something she'll sit down and just listen to as a storytime yet, but I think it will be a timeless addition to our CD collection. As an adult, I enjoyed listening to the stories and the music. A good buy for younger and older children as the music is very rythymic, but not too loud (I think my daughter would have liked it as an infant)."
5,"Fun, challenging, moving","I have to fully agree with the other reviewers of this disc. I am a father of two. My son loves this disc--almost as much as my wife and I do! Although I liked this disc when I first heard it, it continued to grow on me with further listenings. The music and words are fun, challenging, and moving."
5,Very nice,"I bought this for the music, but enjoy the story as well. The songs are beautifully done. It's well worth the price."
5,Definitely recommend buying this book,"I LOVE this cookbook. Prior to receiving this book as a gift, I wasn't really interested in Indian cuisine. Needless to say, all that has changed. I especially like the way she mixes her spices, therefore, I would recommend leafing through the book and buying all the spices beforehand. Once you have the spices, you're set! The recipes are quick and easy. The food is DELICIOUS, light in fat and calories, making it fairly guilt-free. This cookbook does not sit in my book shelf collecting dust!"
2,Simple but could be more user-friendly,"This book provides a good introduction to spices and techniques commonly used in Indian cooking. There are a few things I did not like about the book:- it is poorly organized. I like cookbooks that organize the recipes by course-status; that is, I like to see headings like ""Appetizers,"" ""Chicken,"" ""Lamb,"" etc.. Instead, this book has headings like ""Friends to dinner,"" ""Leftovers?,"" and ""Curry flavour.""- the author often does not specify the level of heat to use or the optimal pan/pot size.- the curries and sauces are often watery.But overall, this book is helpful, provides a section describing common ingredients and techniques, and has beautiful pictures."
5,Cordless kettle,"It's almost the same as the old one, slightly smaller but equally efficient, clean and easy to use, takes little room on the counter and is always ready to brew a cup of tea or fix hot cereal, neatly,"
4,Nice little dragon.,"For the price you can't beat this little dragon. It is quite detailed and well made, as all Papo products are."
1,"Idea's there, quality isn't...","The shower CD player looks cool on the net with a reasonable price, but when I actually got the product, I saw how cheap quality it looked. The station and volume dials are VERY inaccurate and the volume is way too low and distorted. The speakers are muffled, and they sound terrible. Think you can live with that? Well think again... Unfortunately, the CD player was not working. I assure you, I have done nothing damaging to it, as soon as I opened the box, I placed a CD in and it was simply not working. That wasn't the end of it... this isn't a splash proof radio; it broke down two days after I got it because of having water in the battery compartment and display monitor."
3,It is ONLY a shower radio....,"Not gonna replace your Bose... OK pros-good battery life (only uses 4c not 6), sounds rreallly loud through head phones-better than my cd player, won't kill you if it falls in the tub.Cons-latching problems, mirror worthless, and yeah, I wished it sounded like a stereo. If not for the latch, I would have given it a 4 in its genre."
2,"loud, shabby quality","this radio is loud, but the sound quality is horrible, i wish it sounded more stereo like the knobs are the hardest thing to use, especially in the shower, kind of like grabbing a slippery soap bar, havent even bothered to use the cd player, and whenever i stand in front of the radio, it makes some weird noise, probably a interference to the radio the fogless mirror is a joke they basically put that on for no reason, ive been using the same 4 c batteries since july so thats about 4 months, stay away from this thing you wont like it!!"
1,Don't even think about buying this.,"We received this radio as a wedding gift 2 years ago. I haven't used it a single time, it's just been sitting in the cabinet. Well I just moved from SoCal to Washington DC and I decided to give this thing some use. I'm sitting in here in a quiet room and I can barely hear it right next to me! Not only that, but with the Bass Boost on, it just gets muffled like the speakers are blown. I mean, what kind of hunk-of-junk could actually be sold at Bed, Bath & Beyond? My goodness. And for it to cost so much without even coming with a DC adapter? It has a DC jack, but still no power adapter? I don't know what else to say, just to spend your money elsewhere."
3,this is nice.,You don't have to have a chat now to use the FM radio. But the whole thing is kind of fuzzy and there is no way to tell what radio station you are on unless you wait for the person to say what radio it is.The piece works well with the chat now communicators but it makes your ear feel and sometimes you hear funny afterwards for about three minutes.
5,"The witch with the long, sharp nose","I remember this book from when I was little and am desperately trying to locate a copy for my own children. I thought that it was a wonderful book, and I have remembered it all of these years! Can't wait to find one."
2,You get what you pay for,Pros: CheapCons: Bad video quality. Moving diagonal lines are clearly visible.
1,"Just say ""no""","As the other reviewer noted, this movie doesn't have much to recommend it. I would add that it has a great deal of subtitles, where the dialogue is primarily guttoral noises, and the picture quality looks like it was screen captured from a bad TV in a dorm room 20 years ago. I would rather take my chances on a random pick at the rental store by picking a row, shelf, and count how many spaces from the left (take that home instead). As my wife put it, it could be a good movie to use to dump an unwanted girlfriend. She wouldn't want to be around you if this is what you watch."
5,Review of New Mormon Challenge,"Although the book is written by Evangelical scholars, it has been favorably received by Mormon thinkers and educators at BYU and other institutions. It is well-written, and avoids hype and hostility sometimes found in other works which disagee with LDS theology and philosophy. I would highly recommend the book for both LDS, as well as for non-Mormons."
3,"""Republicans"" seen through ""Democrats'"" eyes","While Owen and Mosser are much better scholars than the usual batch of Biblicists, this is still not a neutrally informative book but an anti-Mormon screed. It takes evangelical Protestant assumptions, co-opts them as being ""Christian"" and sees how Latter-day Saints measure up. Kind of hard to measure up to something written by an enemy.BUT, if you're going to read an anti-Mormon book, this is a cut above the usual nonsense. Owen and Mosser are at least in dialogue with the LDS intellectual community, so avoid most of the bloopers other anti-Mormon polemics fall pray to."
2,Deception?,"What I would rather see, than a historical or theological review of one particular sect of Christianity, is a review of Christianity as a whole.... If one is honest with himself, and intelligent, and informed, and sincere, he would recognize that Christianity's very existence is solely due to so many scandals and horrific acts that one could scarcely comprehend. And yet, just as Mormons ""hide"" that which does not seem so favorable, Christians as a whole dismiss with equal--if not even more so--emphasis that which was caused by those ""glorious"" leaders of their faith's past.... Good show. Way to be equal. Way to be American."
4,Better off with paper...,"I think that the book loses something by being read. Although it is funny at parts so much that I was laughing out loud, It gets a little tedious to hear multiple spellings for words over and over. And I found it more difficult to make subtle comparisons than I hearing words than if I had been able to see them. It can't be helped though, after all, it is a book about grammer, spelling and syntax."
2,For serious Hazell fans only!,"What an odd CD this is, Only the fab You're My Rainbow and the mix of Whatever I Do could be called ""Best of"". The other tracks leave a lot to be desired. The version of They Say Its Gonna Rain is not either of the 2 well known Indian Summer or Zulu mixes, rather a Wet Weekend mix! and a 3 minute cut of Searchin' from the 12"" mix would have been better as the 7"" edit or the full 12"" version. Add these to the awful duet with Darryl Pandy and a load of, what can only be kindly described as ""fillers"" and you have this CD. Goodness knows where they dug the master tapes up from, but they should have buried them years ago. Hazell has a great voice and has made some brilliant dance records. So if you want to hear her at her best, stick to the UKs Greatest Hits CD, which I believe is being released in the USA soon or try and find her original Maybe and Heart First CDs. Her Abba album is also worth a listen"
1,A CD-R BEWARE,ANOTHER CD-R FROM HOT PRODUCTION THE LABEL DISAPPEAR YEARS AGO TO FIND AN ORIGINAL IT' ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE SOMEBODY IN FLA IS FOOLING US.
1,Best Of NOT,"Stick to the far superior UK ""Greatest Hits"" import. This US compilation contains songs unknown to most Dean fans, even if they were recorded in England. There are a couple of big UK hits (tracks 3 and 4) but that's it. Even the first track, ""They Say It's Gonna Rain"" is a re-recording of her UK hit. When compared to the stunning original, this version sounds more appalling than it probably is. A great voice like Dean's deserves better than this."
5,A Great Book,"In 1996, Dr. Edwards was featured on the Sally Jessy Raphael Show for making a significant difference in a former student's life that was born with a physical disability, Nancy Johnson Miller. At the time of their initial meeting, Dr. Edwards was a first-year Physical Education teacher at the school where Ms. Miller was a 5th grade student. According to Ms. Miller, Dr. Edwards was instrumental in enabling her to move past her diability by accepting it and by being confident in using and/ or developing the talents that God did give her.As a result of hearing about his impact on this student's life, Dr. Edwards wrote this book. Since then the two have created the Edwards-Miller Foundation for Physical Disabilities, Inc, to provide scholarships for physically challenged individuals to pursue a college education."
5,Practically Priceless,"I can think of no group in jazz more underrated than the '70's Messengers or of any more original, visionary composer than Walter Davis Jr. When will someone have sense to assemble his compositions and perform them as they were intended to be played. He takes Bud Powell's ""Un Poco Loco"" into another world and to a higher level of music, evolving the art and tradition in a direction other than modal, free, fusion or funk. Are musicians too enamored of their own ""creations"" to hear and build on the best of the tradition?Such is not the case, thankfully, with these disciples, Blakey's most soulful overachievers, including the forcefull tenor of Dave Schnitter. Unfortunately, the only major Walter Davis composition on this album is the grandiose and operatic, ""Jodi,"" a dramatic jazz ""aria"" on steroids and by itself easily worth the price of the CD."
2,Need to improve the design,The clips will not fit a slandered pedal (my case trek 4300) unless you modify the slot. I had to use a soldering gun to enlarge the slot before I could install them on my bike
2,Ok while they lasted...,"Broke at the joint near the screws after a few months of mild-moderate use. Also were not tall enough to fit many shoes.Should've gone with metal clips, I'd still be using them."
1,Bad reception for Uniden Walkie Talkies,I got these for my son and nephew to share. They live about five miles apart and I thought they could use these to play together even when at their perspective homes. Don't waste your money! They didn't work. They didn't even work when they were in the same house on two sepearte floors! ARGH!
4,A Great Surprise,"I recently found myself reading a string of books that had left me feeling a bit isolated. I can never get enough of Paul Auster, but I definately needed a break. Fortunately I came across ""Nicholas"" and it has been a great surprise. I was hesitant because of the subject matter and the illustrations, but after reading the first chapter about the class picture, I knew there was something more to the book. Yeah, technically it is a kids book, but so are the Potter and Narnia books. Please don't let that deter you. This book isn't childish, nor is it dumbed down.It does an excellent job capturing moments of childhood that most of us have experienced."
3,Replaced with double edge razor,I shaved with the Atra for years until the cartridges became too expensive. $1.25 or so each was just too much. So I dug out my granddad's 1956 DE (double edge) Gillette Super Speed and found blades for about .15-25 cents each. I got a better shave once I got the hang of it. That was 15 months ago and I have not looked back. Most any multi-blade razor will cause ingrown hairs; not the DE's!
5,An essential CD for EVERYONE!!!!!,"I've waited close to four years (minus side projects) for a new album. Let me tell you, the wait was well worth it. I agree with most of what the other review said, except it sounds like track 3 ""Timing is Everything"" will be the single. Why is this band not recognized??? They need a US tour sometime in the future. Oh, and did I mention, go buy this CD!! You will not be disappointed!!"
2,CONFUSING INFORMATION,"I ordered this book for a class thinking it was the latest edition because it was described on Amazon as having 128 pages, and the older editions had only 110 pages. As it turns out, the 2nd edition IS the latest, but it only has 110 pages. This has caused me great confusion and anxiety as I need the latest edition for a college course. So,believing I was shipped the wrong item, I immediately returned it only to find that the 110 page edition IS the latest, and it will be superceded in February 2010 with the 3rd edition which will have 128 pages. I hope thatAmazon corrects this issue."
1,Cover Band,"If you want to hear Styx buy ""Return to Paradise"", Stay away from this cover band ripoff by Shaw and Young."
1,Rip-off-O-Rama,"Tommy Shaw's missive on the Styxworld website about the band's dedication to long-time fans notwithstanding, this package is a complete rip-off. With the exception of the five tracks on the DVD side of the set, everything else has been released previously. Perhaps Styx would like to explain why they've seen the need to release the St. Louis shows from 2000 for a THIRD time? Or perhaps the overseas and Canadian shows again? This package needs a disclaimer that while the song states ""Everything Is Cool,"" this set ain't."
1,anymore styx stinks!,"You'd think buy know that Styx would get tired of releasing a live album every couple of months.Half the time they're skimpy only offering around 10 songs, and many of the biggest hits are absent. Reo should ditch Styx and tour with Journey instead, at least Reo and Journey can still rock, and at least they put out new products worth buying. It's about time Styx called it quits,they used to be good,but know they're just staying around to long."
3,For huge STYX fans only.,"The entire CD is on STYXworld and Arch Allies and half of the DVD is on Arch Allies. The other 5 songs that have never been released on DVD before are worth the purchase. The live video for ""Everything Is Cool"" recorded in St. Louis but left off the Arch Allies video is great and so is the video for ""Criminal Mind"". The other three unreleased videos are pretty good but not as good as the previous two. A must for huge fans."
3,its ok... but toomuch old stuff,"this cd/dvd is a pretty good effort, but they added too much old stuff, if they were gonna have all the songs from the arch allies dvd, they should've put them on from different concerts, and the KYAG video isint of reaally good quality, they shou have something like come sail away on the dvd side and not on the cd, which is a scaled down version of ""Styxworld 2001"" if you really want good performances of the current styx lineup, you shou get the styx&reo speedwagon arch allies dvd.the reason i give it 3 stars is because the video for a criminal mind and these are the times are really cool!!! if come sail away was on the dvd, i would give it 5 stars, so please, release come sail away on dvd with lawrence gowan singing it."
3,"stay strong stay safe, my son","My son is currently serving with the Marines in Iraq. I have just finished reading this book. There were many similarities with my son and the author's son. We will spend our first Christmas without our son as he will still be in Iraq. I was very offended about the author's comments about the French. I have raised our sons to accept all people, no matter what race, religion , or heritage. Recently I took our 16 year old son to France and I am looking forward to taking my Marine there one day as well.Cathie Drapalikova Jarvis"
3,Book,"I was kind of disappointed in this book. I didn't get into it as much as the previous one I purchased. Also, when I received the book, it had a tear through half of the back cover."
2,"better than in person, but ...","i, too, saw this show and didn't like it. it was the worst of the half-dozen times i've seen pearl jam. i didn't like the set list, the performance was average by pj standards, and it was a short set. that said, the concert is a much better experience in the warmth of my own home. and the show is good -- if there weren't four dozen better pearl jam live albums out there. save your money and get the las vegas show from eight days earlier or the san francisco show from one day later, to name just two far-better shows."
2,Flirty title but not enough to make love to your partner's ears,This book seemed to promise a lot but there was more sizzle than steak. I speak self-taught intermediate Italian and was hoping for a greater range of words to use for making love. It does have some cute idiomatic expressions but lacks the vocabulary that one needs to express a passionate encounter. It might be useful if one spoke no Italian to get a few basic phrases that might contribute to an intimate encounter of the Italian kind.Jamie
2,Just Plain Silly,"The only thing I can give this author credit for is the idea. The rest of it just made me want to laugh! Everything was so horrifyingly predictable - at first I wondered if it was supposed to be a satire on the quintessential ""happy ending"" novel of the time, but its countless sex scenes forced me to scrap that idea. Not to mention the endless (and I mean endless) coincidences and silly actions by silly characters that I just can't be forced to believe.And honestly, I could not bring myself to like the protagonist. Her ""modern"" outlook on life seems, to put it plainly, like that of a modern hooker. She does stupid things and never learns from them - insisting that she won't be ""put down"" by an era wherein it's merely common sense not to do certain things.All in all, the author had a good idea, but her writing was too silly to make it worth reading. At least it gave me a good laugh."
2,If you must read this book get it from the library.,"I have never written a book review before for Amazon, but felt I needed to save other readers from this book. It started out just fine, but started to get plain silly and ridiciulous by the half way mark. By the time I approached the end I forced myself to finish and I should not have. It was a waste of my time. Please believe the readers who have given this book a poor review before me!"
2,"""By a Lady"" gone bad",What started out to have such possibilities turned into a Harlequin Romance. I am an avid Austen fan and couldn't wait to indulge again in another spinoff. I was hoping to truly read some fun Austenesque fiction that might include the atmosphere of her life and times. The beginning and the plot had such possibilities but turned into an opportunity for naughty bits naughty bits naughty bits. Very disappointing and cliche. I was disappointed that the story did not continue on the path it started. Maybe the author decided not to research any further and became bored or was coaxed to decline the subject matter quickly and into the gutter...INDEED!
3,Moderately interesting,"There are too many plot holes, coincidences, and inexplicable behavior for this to be a really good book. But I enjoyed the author's version of early 19th century prose and dialogue well enough to keep reading until the end. The snippets of information about food preparation and other details of life at the time were interesting."
2,Pass on this one,"The author starts out w/potential in her storyline and then it goes 'south' from there-- at about page fourteen and Chapter Two in my opinion. This book did not hold my attention in the least; I found myself leafing thru the pages trying to find the previous potential at the start of the book, but alas I never found it. Sadly, I purchased this book prior to reading reviews and now have a good reason to donate a book to my local library as this book isn't something I want to hold onto in my library. Pass on this one."
1,That was no lady...,"A cute idea ruined by both an absurd story line and terribly derivative, stilted ""period"" writing, and not just Jane Austen's period. The author ""borrows"" phrases from, and (poorly) mimics the styles of, Oscar Wilde, Charles Dickens, and Henry Fielding as well as Austen - and that's just what I recognized from memory; who knows what else she lifted from great English literature?This book is more like fan fiction people post online than something published and sold for money. Glad I got it from the library, but sorry I followed our heroine through her highly improbable, contrived adventures."
5,The greatest music ever.,I found out about this group's music in 1973. It was love at first site. I looked for their records for 15 years. It seems nobody heard about them. Than I finally found them. I was thankfull to the ones who thought to record their music on CD. They are perfect. A music played by virtuosi to be heard with one's ears and mind.
5,Class book,This product was received in excellent condition very quickly ... helped my department keep within budget and meet schedule!THANK YOU!
5,why is this book out of print?,"Other books by Kunitz are occasionally available, but there are some poems - like ""The Science of the Night"" - that there is no other way to get. Kunitz has a luminous voice and writes some very good poetry. If you ever see this in a second-hand bookshop, you should snap it up."
3,MDU,"While this book was somewhat well written, it lacked detailed photos, and drawings to help explain the MDU and it's uses.A little disapointed as the book could have explained detailes better."
3,For Sheila,"I thought this book was real exciting. I think that if you like exciting, mysterious, and wierd books you will like for sheila. I thought it was a nice book, and I think you will to."
5,Good size for spaetzle or mashing fruit,I got this disk with the idea of making spaetzle. That was the first thing I used it for and it worked great. More recently I was making some plum jam and needed to mash the fruit a bit. I halved and pitted the plums and ran them through this disk. Nearly all of the skin stayed behind in the food mill and fruit came out the perfect texture for jam. I did the same thing a few days ago with some apricots with similar success.The only oddity is that the disk came with a plastic bushing in the center hole which was too small for my food mill. I guess Rosle must have changed the design of their mill at some point since I originally bought mine. I popped out the bushing and the hole in the metal is big enough.
5,Pickle Supreme,"A marvelous pickle with delicacy and flavor galore, hits the spot on everything from a simple piece of toast to complex curries, always a delight and brings surprise to newcomers!"
1,What a crock!,This book is such a paper weight! It tells you a bunch of information that's just plain common sense. I'm sure if the author were so successful at making his own production company he wouldn't have been writing this book!!!Don't waste your money and let the author make royalties on this lame book... spend it on something else that would be more usefull. What a waste of my time.
5,A great addition to anyone interested in Herbs.,"I have had several copies of Rodale's Encyclopedia over the years I loan it out and well it never comes back. It truly is a must have I have been to the Rodale Institute Kutztown, PA it really is amazing."
4,An array of information,"is sharred in this book. At times, seeming a little overwhelming, but always full of the info you need want or desire. Amazing pictures, and excellent ideas!! This particular book, I bought as a gift, and is an awesome idea for the garden lover for any special occasion."
4,Tacky packaging,"The book was in excellent condition. However, I almost returned it because the packaging was ripped and I was afraid the book might be damaged. It was wrapped up in newspaper and I could not figure out who sent it to me. (I had ordered 2 of the same book, 2 different people). No paperwork, order form, etc. The name did not match up with any order that I had placed."
2,Herb Pix,"I was a bit disappointed in this book. It may have been that my expectations were too high, but I found it a little lacking."
5,give it to your husbands,"I had my husband read the book, and DR. Farhart gives sexual desires from a womans perspective (how I don't know), but he was able to inform my husband as to how a woman responds sexually to a man."
3,WISHES COULD COME TRUE,"I LIKE THIS BOOK ALOT.I JUST WISH TODD WOULD OPEN HIS HEART FOR HER. SHE WISHED ALL OF HER SEVENTEEN WISHES AND ALL OF THEM STARTED WITH TODD, I THINK HE SHOULD.AT CAMP IT WAS REALLY FUN. I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE CHRISTY AND TODD SERIES."
4,"Not what I was expecting, but worth the $1.50","Good things do sometimes come in small packages, and these stencils are just what we needed to complete the unicorn theme in our daughter's bedroom. It never occured to me to check the book's dimensions out, because on-line it looks to be about the size of a coloring book. It's actually much smaller and has only six pages with one unicorn stencil on each page. Again, it's going to be used for final decorating touches in a four-year-old's bedroom, so for $1.50 it was worth it."
3,Somewhat helpful,"This book, while offering good advice for career paths in general, is not very useful for the Anthropology student. As a graduate of Anthropology I have been working for the last year in a job completely unrelated to my major. I am constantly searching for work and even internships or volunteer opportunities in Anthropology. Because I am having trouble finding work like this, I decided to buy this book. The only resources that they mentioned are things that I have already tried (such as the AAA website). While this book is good for most careers, it is not specific enough to help anyone in Anthropology when looking for a job in the field."
1,SLOW shipping,"I ordered this book a while ago and it was promised to be shipped in two days and I have YET to see any type of ""your item as shipped email"" or received the book yet. It is a waste of money, so far, because I will be leaving the country and needed the book in 2 weeks."
3,If New to Ballroom Dance,"If you are new to ballroom dance, this isn't the best book to buy at first anyway. There are some but not enough dance step illustrations. Unfortunately we bought this book to that find out.We're taking weekly dance lessons, but would forget by the time we went to practice at home. It's too hard to take notes at dance.Instead suggest buying ""How To Become A Good Dancer"" Arthur Murray (Author)"" This book is organized, illustrates the dance steps for each dance and has plenty of explanations. This book helps with practicing at home.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1447416767/ref=cm_cr_mts_prod_imgWe also bought the Arthur Murray Foxtrot and Waltz CDs, sold by Amazon."
3,"My Personal review on ""Seawind""","I owned 2 of Seawinds 8 tracks in the past, Window of a Child and I believe the other was just titled ""Seawind"". Great Jazz music and enjoyable vocals. I will be purchasing them in CD form once the holidays pass."
3,Something's not quite there.,"This new CD is a bit of a let down i'm afraid. JCS hung its hat on being a rock opera and, sadly a little too much polish has taken the edge off it. The singing seems a little too controlled and is missing that spark. Most of the cast does well, but Jerome Pardom's Judas is frankly, quite awful. Glenn Carter tries, but his voice doesn't have the same impact as the likes of Gillan, Neeley or Farnham. A note to Elly regards Could We Start Again Please. Checking my collection, it appears on the Orig. London, Broadway, '74 Australian, Mexican, London Revival('92), New Zealand, London('96) and Motion Picture recordings that's eight in my collection. A little more rock and a sense of urgency and danger and a little less reverence would have been more satisfying. Listen to the 1992 Australian CD to hear a more effective treatment of the show."
4,Love this production,"I am familiar with a couple of other productions of JCS, but this is the one I finally chose to buy. My only complaint is that the volume fluctuates so, one had better have one's hand near the volume control (such as in the car) to compensate."
3,Missing several key songs,"Love the DVD of this version of JCS, but was less than impressed with the CD, as it was missing several key songs. Since I purchased the downloadable version, this omission is inexcusable.With the exception of those missing songs, the downloadable version was very good. The talent of the cast was supurb, to say the least. There is some noticable clipping in the music and vocals, likely due to some volume level balancing done during the ripping process. I do not know if this problem exists on original CD's."
3,Missing Pilate & Christ,"I agree with other reviewers that the original JCS outshines this one, although there are some sterling performances by Fred Johanson and Renee Castle. Which brings me to my biggest gripe. It's missing one of the best songs! I.e., Pilate and Christ. Also Trial Before Pilate just doesn't come across as well as it does on the DVD. Buy the DVD, but pass on the soundtrack."
5,The best JC Superstar,"I read reviews from people who have given this CD one or two stars. Call it nostalgia, if you will, you can safely ignore their opinions because they are similar to those who claim Star Trek with William Shetner was the best.Judas and Mary rule. Piltate's dream in this album is one of my favorites.Cons: I wish they included 'Jesus must die' in this album.Once you enjoy the CD, watch the DVD, you will love it even better. Let's accept it, technology has improved since 1970. This is the latest, best recorded, of all 'Jesus Christ Superstar' albums."
4,Strong Cast...Great Version!!,"This is one of the best versions...with few exceptions. I absolutely love Glenn Carter as Jesus. He not only does he look ""like"" Jesus, but he sounds fantastic. I have seen many versions both on video and on stage and he is one of the best. Jerome Pradon is not the best sounding Judas, but he does a great job with the emotion of the part. Carl Anderson is still the best Judas ever...I just saw him live on stage and he is unbelievable. Renee Castle is a good Mary, however her voice is not very strong. I recently saw a perfect performance of Mary in a Minneapolis stage production and unfortunately Renee doesn't come close to the Mary I saw in my local production. Rik Mayall was an interesting Herod....not the best I've seen. All in all, this CD is a great one...I would recommend to anyone who is interested in JCS. I would also suggest seeing as many versions as you can in order to compare accurately."
4,Well Worth Your Money,"Here is a version of JCS that actually sounds like they mean what they are saying. You can hear the emotions in the lyrics. I am sick of Ted Neeley and his ""non acting"" or ""non emotional"" vocals."
4,An explanation of sorts for JCS,"I have a particular bias towards this show for several reasons I shall not mention. I just wanted to let you guys know that the song ""Could We start again Please?"" is actually not on very many recordings of JCS. I think this may be because it is generally felt as out of place among the other songs and it doesnt seem to fit or it breaks the momentum of the rest of the music. Some further clarification would be that this same song is being sung directly to God/Jesus by Mary and Peter. It is sometimes a little vague as to the direction of the song itself. It is a plea by those closest to Jesus for a new beginning. Interestingly enough they are going to get a new beginning but not the one they had hoped for. I hope this helps!"
1,"Get the '97 London Cast, don't waste money on Glenn Carter","I had the displeasure of seeing Glenn Carter as Jesus in the revival on Broadway last summer -- his range is totally wrong for the role, and he sounds awful.Get the ""New Cast Recording"" from the '97 London Cast which features Steve Balsamo as Jesus, with Carter as Simon Zealotes. Balsamo shines in that version with an amazingly wide range and incredible heart-wrenching ""Gethsemane"", while Carter is much better suited to the smaller role he plays here.As an added bonus, this recording features Alice Copper as King Herod, in a delightfully different twist on the role. This recording's available as both a highlights CD and a full two disc set, so you can enjoy the entire show including Zubin Varla's Judas singing a terriffic ""Damned for All Time/Blood Money"".Don't waste your money on Glenn Carter's horrible butchering of this wonderful musical, get Balsamo's version, and you'll be much more pleased!"
3,Almost Angelic,"In my opinion, (though others may disagree), Jesus Christ Superstar is Andrew Lloyd Webber's best musical. However, this new CD/DVD re-release fails to hit the mark. The acting is excellent and Simon is awesome; although the singing leaves something left to be desired. My main gripe with it is that everytime Judas sung i found myself flinching and grinding my teeth! I sorry but Judas cant sing in this recording. Steer clear of this one and pick up a copy of 1992 Australian version.""In 1992, an Australian concert version in a series of vast arenas broke all the box office records at the time attracting an audience of over one million. The soundtrack made it to the top of the US charts three times."" - Reallyusefulgroup.comNuff said!"
5,TONY VINCENT!,i mean i honestly like this show very much! it is an amazing show but i honestly think TONY VINCENT should of played JUDAS in this show instead of simon. TONY stole the show with SIMON ZEALOTES! tony is amazing and him and glenn were so much better together than jerome was with glenn. Steve balsamo is honestly the best JESUS i have ever heard and if they do a studio cast i think it should be JESUS: STEVE BALSAMO and JUDAS: TONY VINCENT because they both are excellent performers. if you want to hear tony sing you should download his songs from this show on some network. but this musical is still superb enough to satisfy then newest listener but if you are a big time fan just add the movie to the collection and get another JCS cd like 96 london cast. my reason for giving it 5 is because i have been waiting for it and i was not dissapointed that much.
1,Best Ever??? I think NOT!!,"I am flabbergasted. Have any of the people hailing this as a brilliant recording and best ever heard the original? Or the film(1973)cast? Holy moley Batman. This one makes a mockery of the show as a rock opera. Jesus & Judas have to be the worst pair ever recorded. Mary was good, as was Caiaphas and Simon was outstanding. The rest were AWFUL!!! Any JCS neophytes would be best advised to check out other recordings. If you think this ... sounds good, you'll be blown away by earlier recordings. To my knowledge, Could We Start Again Please? has been featured on a large percentage of the recordings dating back to 1971 Broadway and has been a permanent fixture in the show since then as well. A classic has been murdered here. It is a very sad day."
3,"Right Jesus, Wrong Cast","I was lucky enough to see Glenn Carter play Jesus in London in 1997 along with Ramon Tikaram as Judas. It was the most amazing version of this show that I've ever seen. Unfortunately, by the time Glenn made it to Broadway, the show was reconceptualized, his voice had been strained and the special effects had more emphasis than the performances. If you want a good recording, get the London Cast Recording with Steve Balsamo as Jesus. This one is ok. Tony Vincent does a good job as Simon Zealotes (and made a far more interesting Judas than Jerome Pradon). Glenn Carter tries very hard but in this over-directed version of the show, he often comes off as cheesy and superficial. Pradon does a decent job as Judas at times but his whining tends to a little much by the time he makes his exit. Overall, I would only recommend this to die-hard fans of the show or fans of the DVD release."
3,"An Excellent Cast,But Missing Songs Ruins It All.","Unlike others who have reviewed this,I'm very fond of Jerome Pradon's Judas-maybe it's because I viewed the video first-a great performance.The real unfortunate thing(and a reason why I almost DIDN'T purchase the disc)is that a number of key songs are missing.Surely Sony could've forked up the extra four tunes for this release?The missing ""This Jesus Must Die"" ,the pivotal show moment of ""Damned For All Time/Blood Money"",and the wrenching ""Peter's Denial"" are TOTALLY inexcusable.I'd have rather missed out on ""Could We Start Again Please"". I certainly hope a COMPLETE version of this cast on cd will be made available.Definitely buy the extraordinary video performance,then maybe this as a nice side piece,but until a complete version comes out,devotees should pass on this disc."
1,This Superstar is awful !!!,"This recording, with Glenn Carter in the title role, is a dissapointing choice if you want to hear the magnificent lyrics and orchestrations written by Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice. Carter has a little, dry voice that sounds boring and that do not capture the shape of the role.Jerome Pradon, in the other hand, it's an acceptable Judas Iscariot, with a good voice and a sensitive interpretation of the apostle.Tony Vincent, it's probably the best singer and the greatest character in the recording as Simon. Rick Mayall it's simply awful.As Herod, he only speaks or whispers instead of singing. So, do not take this, you should better choose the 1996 London Cast Recording (featuring Steve Balsamo and Zubin Varla) if you want a really really good one cd recording of Jesus Christ Superstar."
4,"Five star performance, minus one star for missing songs","This is a wonderful production of JCS, much as I remember it when I saw it during its limited run on Broadway in 2000. The singing of Glenn Carter raises this among the best versions available, and in my opinion Renee Castle's Mary is the best since Yvonne Elliman fine film soundtrack performance. The musical accompaniment is first rate and the sound is nothing short of excellent and I heard several details in the score I had never noticed before. One small doubt remains: I wasn't crazy about Jerome Pradon's Judas, whose voice was a little whiney in spots (it is a pity they didn't choose Tony Vincent to play Judas since he played this role on Broadway to great acclaim, but in this recording he plays Simon). Also, as other reviewers have mentioned, the lack of a few key songs is really inexcusable. Hopefully this will be remedied in the future. Overall, I'm very pleased with this purchase."
5,A good CD,"I saw the movie last night and I thought it was pretty good. However, I got confused when Mary Magdalen and Peter sing ""Could we start again, please"". I have the original London recording and it doesn't have that song on there. Did they add that or what? I just found that really confusing. Overall, the CD is a great one and has some songs missing but still worth buying."
1,Thanks for the heads-up,"I am eager to get my hands on the soundtrack for this production of ""JCS"" however, I like the *ENTIRE* production, not just select parts of it. Thanks to the reviewers for letting me know that several songs are missing. I'll hold on to my money until I can the soundtrack in its entirety...the soundtrack for the movie I love, not a piecemeal version of songs someone else decreed were fit for the CD.(I gave it one star for having missing songs...I'm sure when (if) they make a ""real"" soundtrack it will get seven or eight stars, just like the movie gets, in my opinion.)"
3,3.5 stars! This should have been a hit for her!,"I say this because it is a pop album, and a good pop album at that. I saw this cd in Best Buy, and wanted to buy it for the low, low price of $9.99, but I don't like to buy music without hearing it first (unless it's from an artist that I am already familiar with).With that being said, I am really surprised that I've never seen a video, heard a single, NOTHING!!! She seems to have the no-brainer essentials for making it in the music industry: She's pretty, You can hear hip-hop influences, R&B; influences, and Pop influences throughout the album, and it's entertaining, you don't really have to skip thru the tracks due to boredom.I'm surprised that I liked it, because I don't usually fall for this type of music that just LOOKS manufactured (Forgive me, I can be quite the music snob!). But then again, there is nothing wrong with Pop/R&B; music, especially when it seems as though the artist put their heart and ""Soul"" in the project."
1,Are we listening to the same album?,"There was nothing special about this album. I bought it on a whim after seeing it recommended by Amazon.com and on different Listmania lists...usually, they dont let me down. This was an exception. I painfully made it through the end of the CD only to know whether I should sell it back or throw it away. Even though she has an okay voice (one very similiar to Brandy), nothing stuck out. It seemed to me as if was a CD made from what someone thought was an ""R&B"" blueprint. If I wouldn't recommend this CD to people who are fans of Soul. But everyone has different tastes...listen to the CD on Amazon and see if its floats your boat, because it sunk mine!"
4,THIS is a QUITE REFRESHING DEBUT!!!,"I found out about Maria the same way the other reviewer did..I was at Wal-Mart just looking in the music section and i saw her and thought she was really pretty and so i just bought her album hoping it would be good.And it is really really good.My favorite tracks are the rocked out ""I Give,You Take"", ""Lonely"", ""My Soul"",""Coffee In Bed"", ""Intoxicated"" and ""Hate To Love You"".Almost every song on here is good and you dont really have to press that SKIP button.Her voice grabs you ske has skills and the lyrics will also catch your attention at times..SOLID DEBUT!!OVERALL GRADE 81/100 = B"
2,. . .,"I got this album for $5.99 on clearance and I'm still disappointed. Her voice is nice, but not anything special. The production is extremely bland. The writing is bad. The whole album is trite and indistinguished. I was bored and I couldn't even make my way through the album without skipping. Skip this release."
1,"Not quite sure how this album got 4.5 starts, but uh....","this album is no good...at all. I bought this spur of the moment while in Best Buy with an urge to just buy some jams. I saw this cd and said, what the heck, lemme give a new artist some royalties...Incredibly disappointed! I couldn't even listen to the entire thing. I maybe listened to three songs tops. The lyrics are cool b/c I read the booklet, but her voice was just not to my liking. I'm mad that I bought it, b/c I'm having a really hard time getting rid of it.Listen to Amazon's snips (wish I had done that). Don't buy it til you've heard it."
1,Y-a-w-n,"Just what the world needs...another fine looking, non-singing, Pro Tools chick! One thing other girls have that this don't is a good groove. Take it from Brandy and Ashanti...get good music and THEN add the Autotune. One star for having the look."
4,She's a good artist,"Maria definitely can sing, the only flaw is that the album is a very run-on album, a lot of the songs have different beats and such, but it's hard to find difference from them all. Even so, this is a wonderful album. Very beautiful, very smooth and pretty, its unfortunate this isn't a hit album, it definitely should be. The music is well organized and constructed, Maria's voice is like a symphony, and I love listening to this album."
5,Excellent depiction of his work.,The performance does an excellent job of capturing the essence of a very complex work of art.
5,The Best Disposable Razor going,"I've always preferred disposable Razors and this Gillette Custom plus is the best I've ever used. You have to make sure you get the black colored grip, and not the Blue or light green one. I don't know what it is but this razor just seems to last longer and shave closer than Gillette's other disposables. And what's more I've rarely cut myself with it. I have senstive skin so I really like a razor that isn't going to tear my face up and this is the one."
1,Pure British Dull,"A male visitor from Venus lands in what they say is USA, but in fact is the dullest of English country-sides, populated by people who barely seem to notice his arrival. In fact, they're too busy doing what they've been doing all their lives: uninspired English matinee theatre. If instead of a visitor from Venus the man Helmut Dantine were, say, a visitor from Tonga, the required changes in the script would be minimal, and the locals' astonishment at his speaking impeccable Oxford English might perhaps be even greater. Although one of the most unbearably boring sci-fi movies of all times, ""Stranger from Venus"" provides first-rate documentary evidence of the profound, meaningful changes which the notion of Alien (both terrestrial and extra-) has undergone in the intervening 50 years. It also shows how even inane sci-fi script-writing has gone a long way..."
3,Stranger from Venus,"I concur with most of the reviews already written.. a ""soft"" sci-fi story relying on dialogue rather than special effects. Patrica O'Neil definately made this movie."
2,Not there yet,"The title of this si-fi is good and you would expect more of the movie. It had almost no action, the story line was weak and it could have been a lot better. The acting was poor and I the movie was disapointing for a si-fi lover."
3,Depends what you want...,"I thought that this would be an amusing way to work on my French now that I live and have a job in Paris. I enjoy reading through this book, and learning about the proverbs. However, I brought it with me one day to show my French co-workers and they were amazed. They had heard of less than 10% of the proverbs in the book. So... if you want to find a pleasant way to enrich your knowledge of French trivia and culture, then buy this book. But if you are looking for a way to better communicate in French, this probably isn't for you."
4,White headhunter.,"Very good book. Interesting, educational and entertaining. A good read and easy to follow and understand. This is a great historical story. It really gives you a good understanding of the relations between certain Pacific islanders and the European explorers that entered their world. Plus it gives a great history on the lives of the ""cannibals"" themselves. A first hand account provided by the ""white headhunter"" himself. This is a cool book. I learned a lot about the Melanesia Islands without even realizing I was learning!! Very entertaining. One of those hidden gems. If you wanna read a very interesting book.... check it out. Would have gave it 4 1/2 stars if they had half stars on here."
5,A Great Collection of Poetry!!!!,"A Great Books for frans of poetry and Sylvia Plath. Best Poems are ones at the beggining and end of her literary career. This is the beggining and one of the best. If you like this, Also look at her last collection of poems, ""Ariel"" Thanx for your time!!!!!!"
3,ok,"Mostly about the see where she lived growing up, not what I remember from my youth about Plath. I was looking for her more aggressive writings."
4,Plath's first underrated book,"THE COLOSSUS has been undervalued because ARIEL is such an overwhelming advance in Plath's power as a poet. Even so, as a first collection of poetry it is impressive and certainly required reading for anyone wishing to understand the development of her work."
2,Not please,These paints are very watery. I just used them as base colors. I would say that you get what you pay for.
2,"ok, but not ok",I read the great review hype on here before I listened to the samples and expected more. I REALLY like her attractive face but the music didn't do it for me except candle burn. I can't afford to buy cds for 1 good song. Her look and sound remind me of German soul singers I used to watch on German tv during the 80s. Make a cd single with dance mixes of that song and you got me.
3,Shameful packaging! Great music.,"This should have been a five-out-of-five star review, but the packaging is so crummy that it is generous to only grade it as a three star.There is no tracks listing. You have to take out the booklet and hunt for the tracks titles in the margins of 18 pages of liner notes. This alone is terrible. But what is worst of all is the all-paper packaging which is very lightweight and cheaply done. It's very hard to extricate the discs from the cardboard sleeves, if you like to handle your discs with care, you'll be cursing the packaging as you put finger prints all over the read-side of the discs.The music is wonderful. The quality of recordings are stellar. Buy this and rip it to your iPod (and then you'll have the track names and you won't have to hunt through the paper booklet) or maybe burn copies on expendable CD-Rs so that you don't ruin your set trying to handle the discs from this shamefully packaged set."
1,Unlistenable,"What a shame RCA! Years waiting for this reissue and they completely ruined it. The 'remaster' is terrible, I can say is unlistenable for disk 1 at least. Dont think your copy is defective, they all sound the same. You wont be able to turn up the volume, if you will, you wont listen to the Duke's music but you'll isten your speaker breaking apart in front of you. Nothing in the liner notes to explain why these CD sound like this: did they use 78's, second copies? You'll never know, that is not your business. Can someone somewhere put a stop to these greedy companies like RCA, who try to cash 'repacking' a product without even bothering to listen to how bad these CDs sound? Save your money, look for an imported version of these recordings and considser twice before buying CDs from RCA."
5,A ROYAL FEAST,"The great Duke Ellington gave us 50 years of courtly blues. The tunes here have classy beauty and soulful depth that just never lose their appeal, like jewels that reveal different facets with each exposure.It's an elegant, swinging collection, full of sparkling arrangements and virtuosic playing. Truly great!!"
4,Greatest Duke; Spotty Remastering,"I suppose if I had to pick one Ellington ""era"" to listen to for the rest of my life, it would be the superb 1940-1942 band featured on this set. Classic follows classic; impeccable swing, spectacular ensemble scoring and great solo work abound.As for the sound quality....Yes, some of the acoustical warmth and depth lost on the dreadful ""Blanton-Webster Band"" set have been restored here - you can actually HEAR the bass this time around! But on some tracks - mostly on disc one - there are obvious and annoying digital ""artifacts"" that make the high-end almost unlistenable. ??!! How could BMG get so close and then blow it by not re-doing the first, obviously inferior disc? Still worth it for the sonic upgrades of 2/3 of the material."
4,Like-failed with 1st use-fix it,"Would have given unit a 5 if it hadn't failed the first time I used it. I really like this lantern when it works. Note: for the warranty to be active you have to register w/in 30 days of purchase. Missed that little detail. My switch stopped turning the lantern off with 1st use. If you cannot turn it off, it is useless. Took the unit apart and a few metal flakes fell out. Jiggled the switch and reassembled. Working great now. Hopefully the problem is fixed."
4,Bright light,"Purchased this lantern because of the size of the light... had purchased a cheapie from Walgreens for 1/3 the price, but that wasn't very bright and just a wind-up. So much better to have solar and a large, real bulb. It's for emergency, but I've used it a bit... and keep it charged up."
1,doesnt work welll at all,"this product was definitely not worth the price ....deceivingly small, solar panel dont work battery life really bad and aint that bright anyway ! waste of money ! avoid"
2,batteries will die,"I have the old one without the L.E.D. upgrades. I kept it for emergency use. When i got around to trying it, the battery was already dead. Don't count on it in an emergency. The good thing is that you can still use D batteries with it, but I am paying for solar panels, so I want them to work. I would get standard rechargeable batteries instead of these sealed lead acid batteries. I decided not to replace the battery, because if the solar panels don't work either, then i'll be doubly screwed- I wouldn't be able to use the battery for anything else. Or the battery just might not fit. I read the product dimensions given by most SLA batteries, and they measure too small for this lantern's compartment. Also, D batteries will have a hard time fitting into the compartment also. The springs are just too big. I had to cut them off which was tricky, because of their twists."
1,Lasted only weeks,"Took months for the order to arrive, nearly half a year. I repeatedly received emails asking if I wanted to cancel the order or keep waiting and I chose to keep waiting. Product worked wonderfully for less than a month. It will not charge via it's own built in solar panel or when plugged into any other source. Device will not power on at all unless it is plugged into a power source. Light is very lightweight and definitely has a ""cheap"" flimsy feel. I have kept the light in like new physical condition so I can't imagine what caused it's failure. I may dissect in hopes of being able to repair."
1,100 % Junk,"I ordered this seeing the reviews, when I opened the box, I was surprised to see the worst product I ever purchased in Amazon. The plastic is cheap...looks like this was made in the backyard of some Chinese cottage industry..the marking are blurred and looks like some kid painted it...Please don't waste your money....and the sad part..it stopped working after 2 weeks...and it wont get charged...now I am stuck with a junk,,,which even the recyclers wont pick up...Sorry Wagan...I wanted to be honest...please stop selling this kind of junk. Amazon: Just see what you sell, you have a good reputation to keep."
2,no charge level indicator,"i was very disappointed with this product because there is no indicator to let me know when this product is fully charged or its current charge level.also, after it is fully charged it doesn't stop charging unless i unplug the adapter leading to over charging, and since i have no way of knowing what the charge level is i can ruin the battery to boot.in essence this item is useless because i never know how charged it is, thus how long i can count on it when i need it.also the solar panel arms are plastic and when i moved the panel it felt like it could easily break.that said, i gave it two stars because once it is charged it gives off a descent amount of light."
1,Truthful Trash,"This book is not only out of date, it is out to lunch. Not worth the paper it is printed on.Don't waste your time."
3,"A reasonable price compilation, but...","This greatist hits is very comprehensive, but notice thattracks are re-recordings.Original artists.(poor booklet)"
4,A study of Italian Renaissance 'despotism',"D.M. Bueno da Mesquita's study of Giangaleazzo Visconti, duke of Milan, is one of the finest studies of an Italian Renaissance 'despotism' that has been produced, and has not been replaced in either Italian or English. Unfortunately it was published - by CUP - in 1940, and has not had the circulation it deserves. A reprint - possibly with an updating introduction - would make a valuable contribution to the current state of politics and state-building in Renaissance Italy."
4,Great fun,"Even Shakespearean newbies will get a laugh out of this. The video is of a live show performed by a well cast trio of talented comic actors. William Shakespear wrote for everyone, comedy and action was part of his legacy. The Reduced Shakespeare Company may be irreverent but the Bard would have appreciated the joke."
5,The Play's The Thing,"I was really excited when my mom told me that we had tickets to see something called the Complete Work of William Shakespeare Abridged. But I had no idea what I was in for. Use the restroom before you see this DVD! Do no eat or drink anything while watching this DVD! Hamlet I finally understood, Julius Caesar has finally been condensed, Titus Andronicus was finally gory, and the lineages and thrown passing were all made very clear. Being a regular Ashland Shakespeare Festival goer, an avid reader of anything by or about Shakespeare and a movie buff, I really enjoy this DVD. If you love Shakespeare but think it might be a little too hard, just buy this and I swear you'll be a literary genius in no time. And Adam, I'd keep that dress if I were you!"
5,Fabulous!,"A hoot and a half! A rollicking good time! Fun to watch with an English teacher, or just by yourself. Absolutely hysterical! By the way, should they ever come out with a video of their Abridged US History production, I highly recommend that as well."
3,Somewhat disappointing,"Before purchasing this video, I read the synopsis and thought it would be a great teaching tool for my Shakespeare class. Everything I read suggested that it would facilitate readers' basic comprehension of Shakespeare's texts. Upon watching it, I was disappointed to find that most of the plays were really only given passing mention. While I realize that it would be virtually impossible to accurately present all of the plays (let alone the sonnets) in one performance, I had hoped that each would be encapsulated, however briefly. Instead, the players simply summed up most of the plays in groups (the histories, the comedies, etc.), with such extreme brevity that watching will neither build appreciation for nor understanding of Shakespeare's lesser known works. The renditions of Romeo and Juliet and Hamlet are the best segments on the video. I will use those with my students."
3,A real disappointment.,"I wanted to like this video. I love shakespeare and I think it is ripe for parody. As funny as these guys are, and they are very funny, the humor is in their skills and not in the material. Buy this video for the humor and slapstick, but do not expect an intelligent use of the Bard's material. I believe the concept (presenting the works all at once in a rapid humorist way) is a great idea. Unfortunately this presentation did not do it successfully."
5,Class in stitches!,"My Shakespeare class is made up of high school juniors and seniors who beg for more each time I show them a segment from this video! They appreciate the rip-roaring humor these three gentlemen pump into Shakespeare's works. As their teacher, I enjoy watching them delight in the Bard. Some may feel this video is trite, but the fact remains that real enjoyment can only be had if one is familiar with the work. Watching this video has enticed my students to actually want to read the plays!This is a teachers must-have tool if you're doing Shakespeare."
3,"Clever, would have been better live but overall, messy","It is hard to maintain a nonstop performance where you are portraying a cast of thousands-not to mention diverse works; plays and sonnets included. It did not make the transition from live theatre to film. Perhaps too big an ask as it requires improvisation and audience participation to flow. When the interaction between performers and audience fired, then it was enjoyable, with some good belly laughs. But the routines became a sameness and it lost its spark. Replaying Hamlet was clever. If you have seen this group live, this may be a good reminder of their skill and ability."
5,FUNNY,Love this group! if you love shakespeare then I HIGHLY recommend this DVD. My favorite play that they do is Hamlet :)
5,Never laughed like this!,"It is hilarious! You can't imagine how hilarious this is. If you Love Shakespeare, Hate Shakespeare, or LOVE to HATE Shakespeare, just get it. You'll be laughing non-stop."
1,What dreck!,"If looking for a witty and intelligent send-up of Shakespeare you should avoid this video like the plague! I ordered this in hopes of finding a cerebrally humorous spin on the Bard -- in the vein of the Black Adder or Monty Python series -- and was profoundly disappointed. What I found were pedestrian pratfalls and predictable jokes. If you seek sophmoric humor this video might suit you very well. Otherwise, look elsewhere."
5,the reduced shakespeare company,"absolutely amazing. there were times i was laughing too hard to see, and other times that my dad was laughing so hard i thought he might die! they are non stop funny and everyone i've showed this to has wanted a copy."
5,Funny without having read all the the Bard's works,"Some of the other reviews have suggested you may not enjoy this as much if you're not familiar with most of Shakespeare's works, but my 8 year old whose knowledge of Shakepeare is via Disney and the Wishbone television series, laughed throughout at the antics of the actors. The humour includes moments of slapstick and pure silliness as well as poking fun at the great works. Knowing the basic plot of Hamlet and Romeo and Juliet will help your enjoyment, but it's certainly not necessary to get a good laugh."
5,Very good,"This film is really funny...comparable to monty python for those who like british humor, although the laughs in this movie are international..."
1,"'There are 1000's of Haunted house books, dont need more'","This book is straight 'Haunted house' book. And 'Mischief' was also not original. Harrow - become school in 'Mischief' and become 'Haunted House' in this book. Not a sinlge character is original, they all have apperared in haunted house stories before. And the writing style is very confusing. Whatever happened to the author who wrote A+ grade books such as; 'YCW..' 'Halloween man' 'Nighmare cron..'? Hope he will come out with something goood."
4,A Supernatural thriller.,"The story is of the haunted Harrow boarding school and its deadly past that attracts the PSI Foundation and a wealthy benefactor who has her own reasons for wanting Harrow's secrets found.We meet three unique individuals in the names of Chet Dillinger, Cali Nytbird and Frost Crane all of whose past histories are wonderfully laid out so we get to know them long before they start their stay in Harrow. I disagree with the Publishers weekly review in that I don't think this part of the book dragged at all, I only wish their was more to the rest of it. I really think more could have been written on the character of Cali Nytbird and her involvement in a murder investigation.This book was a great escape from the more horrific current events going on around us. If you like the works of King, Koontz and McGammon, you will definately enjoy ALL of Douglass Cleggs books."
2,Jackson + Matheson + Tryon = BLAH!,"The first half of the book is mainly a character sketch and he takes dozens of pages to build up backstories that really don't matter that much. Then, as one character approaches the house, street names read Jackson Street (a homage to Shirley Jackson, THE HAUNTING OF HILL HOUSE), Matheson Street (HELL HOUSE), and Tryon Street (for Thomas Tryon, THE OTHER, et al.)Clegg wants a little HAUNTING and HELL HOUSE but he ends up with ROSE RED, a terrible ""haunted house"" story that adds nothing to the genre.And nothing really happens here until the end, which reads like a bad 70s TV movie of the week. I skimmed the last 70 pages which is the WORST thing you can say about any book.This novel reads more like an outline of character sketches with no real plot or narrative drive.I say skip it."
4,a good horror book,"I liked this book. However, I thought it was a horror book, and it got boring in the first parts of the book. He could have taken some of the charcter bios info out. That being said it still was a very good read and I would tell anyone that likes this genre to read the book. Still, a good horror book"
2,No real action until around page 300,"This was a long read in my opinion and definitely not one of Clegg's best. I have read quite a few of Clegg's books and have never found them boring but this one was an exception to the rule. If you like long drawn out novels then read this one otherwise you would be safer buying one of his other books such as The Halloween Man, You Come When I Call You or The Nightmare Chronicles. I found all of these hard to put down once I got started reading them."
1,Great writing Style...Bad story,"I just finished this book. I really like the author's style of writing (while the proofreader should have cought some GLARING screw-ups). I liked characters and the idea behind the book.I had problems with the over 200-page character set up and then nothing. The booked died as if it was hurried along just to finish. The so-called spooky bad guy free for all was all of the last 40 pages and then it was still a HUGE let down.This was not a very 'horror' horror book, unless you call the pulsing walls scary.(That was not even ten pages from the every end.)It needed a lot more spook and to be longer...or the character setup shorter.Don't buy it. Just don't.I am going to give the auther a second chance and pick up a different book. I want to see if it was him or the story that was the screw up."
2,Where's the horror,"Like many of the other reviewers, I read a lot about Clegg and his supposed great talent. I finished the book wondering where all the hype is coming from.The book had a promising start, and the long sections introducing the main characters added some emotional heft to the hovel.But let's fact it, most readers of horror books want something scary to happen. With ""The Infinite"" you are three-quarters of the way through the book before anything remotely scary, or horrifying, happens. Then it's over very quickly. Plus, what does happen really isn't all that interesting.People can criticize Stephen King all they want, but King, along with other writers such as Dan Simmons, know how to dole out the scares leading up to a big ending.With ""The Infinite"" it was all build-up and no pay off."
4,Filter,"I like this filter but when I tried to clean it according to the directions, the dirt didn't come out so I used the air compressor and that worked better."
3,Tony Bennett's New York,I LIKE THE DVD BUT I HAD PROBLEMS WITH SOUND AT TIMES NOT BEING LOUD ENOUGH EVEN IF I TRIED TO ADJUST THE VOLUME.
4,Slackstring,"I first discovered slackstring through a mountain bike dvd called ""the collective."" They are a really good band and this cd represents their early work. Since they seem relatively new, I don't doubt they're going to break onto the independent scene pretty nicely. This cd is missing Sunday Jen which is one of the flagship songs off the dvd but it's still worth dropping the money for it. If you like bands like Dispatch and the Panda Dub Squad, you'lle love this band. Also, it's just a good cd to chill out with and enjoy."
5,very good,"very good i play it all the time i buy all the music from lunasa and the solo stuff from lunasa members..if you like fun irish music, this is for you"
4,Nancy Sinatra fan,"I really like the cd. My main reason for buying it is for her bang, bang soundtrack that was played out in the movie kill bill. Her other songs have grown on me. Good cd"
4,Very Nice,I bought this for my husband for Christmas. He loves it. The only thing he does not like is that it does not shave his neck very well. The thing he likes best is that it charges quickly and comes in a protective travel case.
1,USELESS - Try the Pulsonic,This razor stinks....I bought this and a Braun Pulsonic to test side by side. I was disappointed by this unit and the Braun walks circles around this thing.I give Phillips one Star for packaging the product to make it look attractive...THATS IT!!!
1,Philips Norelco Arcitec 1060,"I have used Norelco shavers for 40+ years, and I love the look and weight of this shaver.I used it for 6 months and was so dissatisfied I finally switched to the Braun Pulsonic.The Arcitec shaves poorly and harshly. The famous floating heads are gone, instead the heads pivot from the center of the assembly - i.e. they tilt away from your skin rather than into your skin. You end up trying to shave with the middle of the shaver assembly, where there is no cutting head.Also, they moved the trimmer inboard so it is hidden by your hand if you hold it the way you would normally. This you can adjust to.They need a major redesign of the detachable shaving head assembly. If they made the cutting heads pivot on their centers instead of from the inside edge, it would probably work and they could sell guys like me the redesigned shaving head assembly. Maybe they could also go back to the Spectra cutters?JM"
1,Terrible Quality of shave and product,Had this shaver for about a year. My old $40 braun is waaay better than this one. The Norleco shaves terribly and leaves patches of hair. And now on top of all this it was completly dead this morning. Does not work at all! And like some other people have said it does leave you with razor burn and still doesn't shave close enough for your skin to feel smooth.WARNING!! DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT IT IS AWEFUL!
1,Horrible razor,I have had Norelco electric razor products for many years. This is the first one I hated. It does a terrible job of shaving and the trimmer is all but useless. I went back to one of their standard models at less than half the price and it works great. Don't waste your money on this one.
2,Not worth the money,"This one is just not worth the money. The concept is great, but after a month or so I noticed my father's shave wasn't as close. You cannot really clean this razor head. You cannot take the blades apart to clean them as in many of the older Norelco models. The whiskers then clog up in the razor head. I have found myself using a toothbrush handle and tapped on the razor head repeditively to losen things up and I could not believe the debris that continues to come out of the razor head even after the daily cleaning. We replaced the head after 6 months and have found ourself repeating the same ritual. I will switch back to our old razor."
3,Good for not bein great,"I like this razor because it is a quick shave on a bad day. Or anyday I guess. Its just not as great as I would have hoped around the neck and with the side burns. And some hairs it just wont take down. No matter how lond and how red my neck gets. Anyways, I still use it for work and it gets the job done. I just dont think its worth the money."
4,Good but not great on thick beards,"It does a clean shave on my face but it misses some neck hairs. I have a thick beard and shaving daily with a disposable razor really tears up my face. This is definitely a lot easier on my skin but I sometimes have to follow up with a disposable razor on my neck to get all the hairs. That is why it gets a four out of five stars. I previously had a braun razor and it was horrible. I would have gotten a cleaner, closer shave with a dull knife then what I got with the braun."
3,I hope it will get better...,"I had an old (5 yrs) Norelco that worked quiet well, but I was deligthed when saw the arcitec's design. Definitely the shaving experience is not even half as good as my old Norelco, although the battery, cleaning system, and display is superior.I hope it gets better as my face gets used to this new system."
2,Not worth the money for poor results,"As others have said, I too really wanted to like this razor. I've used a blade for decades, and wanted to believe that an electric razor - purportedly the latest technology version - would work (nearly) as well. I was very disappointed. Yup - it looks cool, very avant garde, and high-tech.The results I experienced - after 4 weeks of trial as suggested by Norelco - is that I had to shave two or three times a day. I could have had far better results with a blade just once in the morning.I tried shaving in the shower - which Norelco says works better - with no better results than dry shaving. My razor is on the way back to Amazon for a refund.My compliments to Amazon for their return policy. I've purchased dozens of items through Amazon, and this is the first major disappointment - and has nothing to do with Amazon, but the lack of performance by Norelco.Save your money - or explore other options."
5,Excellent product,"I bought this as a replacement of my 8 year old Norelco. So far it's been more than three weeks and it is still charged and shaving fine. I especially like the hard travel case. You have to remember to empty it after each shave or the red light comes on. much smaller space than the old one. It sans to always rinse with hot water, but I'm only doing that every few days since I don't feel like running water till hot gets to the bathroom in the morning after swimming.There are huge price variances for this. Amazon showed them all and I got it at about half price."
5,Philips Norelco arcitec 1060 review,I bought this electric shaver as a gift for my boyfriend. It's a nice looking shaver and works wonderfully. I received it within a few days of ordering. He's very pleased.
4,Faster shave than my old Norelco,"The shave seems faster than my old Norelco, could just be the new blades and not the ""improved technology"". I like the ability to clean with hot water ... I don't like the smaller beard trimmer .. it is awkward when trying to trim all sides of sideburns."
3,"Works great, but product finishing is very bad","I like this shaver and think it works great. However, the black/silvery coating on the on/off button and the central piece of the shaver comes off after about 2 months of use. Does not affect the shave but the looks of the product."
5,Best Norelco Out There!,"I bought this model about a month ago from Costco for $119. The package also included a bonus 2 head battery powered Norelco travel shaver. What a deal! The Aritec 1060 is without a doubt, the best Norelco I've owned and I've been through a lot of them. The shave is extremely close, fast and comfortable. The shaver stays up on power for a long, long time before needing charging. It's so easy to clean with running water or the supplied brush. The only downside that I can see is the replacement cost of the shaving head (you can't replace just the rotor blades). However, the overall quality of this shaver makes it a must for a clean, smooth shave. The bonus battery shaver which came with the 1060 is amazing! It's perfect for traveling. I do wish it had a sideburn trimmer though. All in all, this is a great package deal and the price can't be beat!"
2,Not so good,"I have used Norelco products for over 30 years. This is the first loser. My wife gave it to me for Christmas to replace a ten year old traditional Norelco. I tried to like it for her sake. I have gone back to the ten year old razor. The trimmer is useless, it is difficult to use, and it takes at least twice as long to get a decent shave. Loser."
1,Norelco Arcitec 1060 Review,"I recently purchased teh ARcitec product to replace my Norelco XL shaver.I have used Norelco electric razors for over 20 years and find that the arcitec razor is the worst performing electric razor that i have ever used.In particular, shaving around the neck area has been the most difficult area for the razor to take care of.I would not recommend this razor to anyone"
5,Norelco arcitec 1060,"Prior to buying this product I read a lot of bad reviews. I decided to buy it anyway. I am very glad I didn't listen to all those bad reviews. Initially I wasn't very impressed by the closeness of the shave. But after using it for a week or so I noticed that the shave was at least as close as my previous norelco razor. I like the feel of the razor when shaving. The heads get into closer places than my previous razor could get to, like those tricky hairs right below the nose. The trimmer works well and is really neat once you get used to it. The pod case that comes with it fits well in a shoe in my suitcase which is very handy on the numerous trips I make. And after 3 weeks plus of use I still have plenty of my initial charge. Overall a very good razor, I am glad I bought it."
1,Gross,"I think just be looking at the cover, you can tell how rough this looks. Topal's poytrayal as Tevia dosn't help it. This is a very dark, quit version of Fiddler and the bonus tracks will scare the ever living flesh out of your kids. The early sketch for the dream was very very upsetting. Now I can't go to sleep at night because of this recording. Everything after the dream is just dissapointing and I don't blame the muscial because that is good but this is bad. The bonus tracks are just tracks you'd hear at a Halloween party. Not on an Original London cast recording. Seriously, the tracks at the end are very very scary. Do not buy.I reccomend the American recordings. [The original Broadway and the New Broadway cast recordings]."
5,Great tasting bar,I have one of these for breakfast nearly every day at work. After trying quite a few different bars the Smore's Balance Bar tastes the best by far. Also this is one of the few without any nuts in it.
1,Its not worth the money and waste of time,"First of all, I thought it was the whole movie and it wasnt. It was just a episode that Melvin James made into a ghetto show for 30 minutes. Then you got DJ Khally or Khaled, (whatever he wants to be called) having a reality show with Trina. It wasnt very good at all, the whole thing. If I were you, I would save your money and skip this DVD. Trina shouldn't have put this into the market, very big mistake!"
1,Please Do Not Buy This Movie,"I rented ""With Friends like These"" because I thought it would be a funny urban comedy that me and by girlfriends could watch. I will try my best night to come across to harsh while I try to explain how bad this ""pilot"" was in my opinion. The acting was T-errible! The story line was L-ame!!"
3,Interesting read,"When on thinks of literature on military technology, pictures of jet foils, nucleared powered subs, and ultra-fast tanks usually come to mind. But one of the oldest and most important technologies in the martial arts is armor and protection against projectiles. This book is a comprehensive treatise on the latest materials used in armor and protection: ceramics. The design, development, testing, and use of various ceramic materials used in armor protection is explained here. The materials focus is on alumina, silicon carbide, boron nitride, silicon nitride, and boron carbide. The book is divided into many small chapters, with each chapter emphasizing the properties/applications of a specific material. Each chapter is chock full of references, and the entire text is replete with figures, tables, charts, with some in color!"
2,Is it documentaly video ?,"I think there are many talking time. This title is ""Swimsuit"". Real running time for swimsuit are about 20 minutes. uuuuu."
1,This item is mislabelled!,"This is not a 10 pack of drives. It is mislabelled. If you order this, you will receive a single drive. At least Amazon made it very easy to return, and paid for return shipping. In case it gets fixed in the future, the item title is currently ""LG Electronics 10PK DVDROM 16X MAX DRIVE ( GDR8163BI )"""
1,"Terrible, terrible, terrible!",Please do not waste your money...song choices are lackluster & that is being kind. I purchased this for my class and played it twice before no one could listen to it again.
2,This is NOT the ultimate fake book!,"All these songs yet so many standards are not in here? What's that about? I bought this book sight unseen because it's a FAKE BOOK WITH OVER 1200 SONGS. ""Certainly it will have 'Stormy Weather',"" I thought. Wrong! I won't go through the list except to say it does not have many standards like that, which I would expect to see in THE ULTIMATE FAKE BOOK.A huge disappointment."
5,Great!,"I got this as a companion to ""The Best Fake Book Ever"" and between the two, there aren't too many classics missing. With these books, you will always be ready for that unexpected wedding or lounge gig. Hey, whatever it takes to buy food and keep the lights on, right?"
5,"The Ultimate fake Book, I Just Loved it","The Ultimate Fake Book with over 1200 songs doesn't the title say it all,Its a good reference for old songs .If are looking for newer songs this isn't for you."
3,Three Ring Binders,"One reviewer complained about the binding. I agree. When I buy a book like this to use on gigs, the first thing I do is remove the binding, 3-hole punch the entire thing and put it in a good-quality 3-ring binder. It's easier to handle and also makes it easier to copy single pages for other band members or singers."
5,Great Collection!,"This is the first Fake Book I have ever owned. I have been using it almost daily for 9 months with my Hammond Organ, and I have been able to get some pretty amazing sounds for a beginning keyboardist. It includes a great variety of tunes, and I am continuing to discover new ones every day, it seems. Lots of show tunes and older tunes, but I am left wanting a few more pop/rock titles so I am ordering ""Best Fake Book Ever"" next. There truly are a LOT of songs, though, and I have to say it is a great book to have!!"
4,Great!!!,"Great collection of songs!!!! Love it! Guitar chords are sometimes too complicated!!! Many of the songs can be played with fewer and easier chords! Have to transpose many songs, but for me that's not a problem. But for many people, it might be a problem ... But great book overall!!!"
5,Great Seller,Great product. It's a great teaching tool with accurate guitar chords and tons of great songs of all styles packed into a compact package. The four pages of guitar chord diagrams at the end is a big bonus.
3,"Great selection, poor harmonization","It's great to have a selection of 1200 songs at hand, but in the case of this particular selection, you'll have to check the chords... Most songs suffer from ""over-harmonization"", as if someone has been eager to find a matching chord for each and every note in the melody, disregarding the whole bunch of types of transition notes that melodies tend to be made of... Wouldn't use it for gigging, but as a source to start an arrangement from, it can be useful."
1,Don't Buy This Book!,"I've been playing piano for over 40 years and own several fake books. I bought this one about five years ago, but never really had a chance to look it over. I was looking for a tune called Little Girl Blue, and this fake book had it. I was so surprised when I opened to the page where the tune was. The entire bridge was missing! After contacting Leonard, I was told that the tunes in this book were advertised as arrangements and may not be complete. Hogwash!! That's not the way the book was described at all. Keep away from this one unless you want fractions of tunes.jayemmar"
4,Very useful book with a wide range of music to suit all tastes.,Highly recommended as a very good book providing a wide range of sheet music to suit all tastes. It is excellent as an archive of songs for musicians who want the choice of a wide range of songs to suit different occassions. Sheet music is presented in single or two sheet format making it very easy to copy and creating your own playlist selections.My only complaint is that the binding is not strong enough to support such a big and heavy book and within two weeks of using it the index pages started to fall out.
3,THE ULTIMATE FAKE BOOK-1200 SONGS FOR C INSTRUMENTS,"WOULD NOT BUY IT AGAIN. MANY PIECES ARE NOT IN THE KEY OF C. THE KEY SPELLER IS FOR GUITAR KEYS AND NOT FOR PIANO. MOST SONGS ARE OLDIES, NOT MODERN"
1,Insufficient information,"Was interested but not being able to see what it actually consists of (view inside) I passed it by and spent $$$ at a brick and mortar store where I could look at what I was purchasing.Don't need a lot but not being a pro musician I have no idea what is actually in a fake book.This is the net folks, not a brick an mortar, wake up if you want to sell to me."
5,Great Fake Book!,This book is a good crossover book containing many contemporary titles useful for connecting with a younger audience. There is also ample material from the 20s through 50's to keep it interesting as well. Key signatures are in line with most of the tunes I've played so far. I would recommend all working musicians have a copy of this one in their arsenal.
4,Great,Great for people like me who love music but can't read it. It helps to make me sound good. I love it.
2,don't bother if you want music from the recent decades,I'm over 30 and I have only heard of maybe 10% of the songs. A lot from the 1930's and so forth. Not a younger person's choice for pop music.
2,Disappointed,"Not enough modern songs for my taste, but that's not the problem for me. The BIG disappointment for me was half of the pages falling out off most of the binding when I stood the book on its end. The plastic binding is too flimsy for the size of the book. Saw one reviewer who said they hole punched the thing, but for the price, I shouldn't have make an additional investment."
3,Can we really believe any of it anymore?,"The original edition of Psychic Discoveries was interesting when it came out the first time but back then people were maybe more credulous. Strange how some of the things seem harder to believe now the Ruskies are our friends.And what about all that stuff about ""astrological birth control""? I found a book about it on Amazon called ""The Lunar Cycle: Astrological Fertility Control"" by Francesca Naish. Quite interesting actually."
5,A CD for kids and parents,"We bought this CD for my 4 year old, who just loves it. It's been a year and it's still in regular rotation. Children aside, this is great Zydeco music that I'm sure mom and dad will find enjoyable as well."
5,It's All Boogaloo Now,"My four year old daughter loves this CD so much that she calls all trains, train movies, train anything ""Choo Choo Boogaloo""! Buckwheat sure knows how to appeal to the kids and keeps things fun and interesting enough for moms and dads, too. Changing rhythms, train sounds and good narration all serve to make this one CD you look forward to hearing again and again. This is the only children's CD I listen to even when there are no kids around."
5,Superbe,"Ce cd est tout à fait sublime, je l'écoute et reécoute. Je l'aimerai à jamais.Si quelqu'un veut communiquer avec moi pour me donner son impression ne vous genez surtout pas."
3,Too much hype,"After reading the reviews for this, I was soo excited to receive the cd. While I liked the idea of having narration introducing children to the music and the different instruments, I found the recordings themselves to be surprisingly flat. Where's the fun and excitement?? This is zydeco! This is zydeco for CHILDREN! The music and vocals didn't come from the heart, I felt no life in the recording. Even the Sesame Street zydeco song was better than this. My class (2 1/2 to 5 y/o) was not dancing around the room to it, either."
3,Not Bad!,"This is a good CD and I enjoyed it alot when i listened to it, if you want some really good music that is good for kids try Crazy Curt and the fireballs. They have a variety of different types of music my kids love it!"
3,"Good, but not among our most loved.","My toddler just isn't terribly excited about the music. She loves this style of music usually, but somehow this CD just doesn't ""do it"" for her. I actually like it more than she does."
5,My children LOVE this CD! Replaced Ralph's World,"We have been huge Ralph's World fans, listening to Bottom of the Sea or Ralph's World OVER AND OVER AND OVER again. We received this for Christmas and now my 3-yr old son says "" Let's listen to the Choo Choo Music!"". And my 19-mth old jumps up and down excitedly. Their favorite is the first song. They could listen to that one exclusively- but I need a bit more variety than one song. :)As an intro to each song, there is the conductor speaking, explaining the the Cajun or Louisiana influence on the following song. The kids barely pay attention to that at this point, but I find it interesting.We will definitely be buying another Buckwheat Zydeco CD for ourselves soon and will buy this one as gifts for all our toddler friends.Don't worry, RW isn't out of the picture yet. I sneak him in because I love the CDs so much. So do the kids. :)"
2,This is okay!,"This is not what I expected. By the reviews you'd think that this is going to be a fast paced hip hop record. If you like the Streets this may be something for you to check out. It has nice beats and don't get me wrong it does have a reggae feel to it. I would not call it hardcore techno. It more has the feel of lounge techno. By that I mean, just sit back and nod your head to the beat and enjoy the what you are hearing."
1,would not play,"Had been looking for this CD for sometime,very excited to receive it, then CD would not play, we tried 2 other players with the same result."
5,cost effective sloution,I had been using NERO because the CD burner that comes with MS was hard to find. When I got a new computer I lost the Nero. After reading a lot of the reviews and seeing how poor Nero and Roxio were rated and how complicate they had become I chose the NTI. It has proved easy to use and loaded onto the computer without problems. A very simple tool to use for copying data and photo files. Menu's are clear and easy to follow. If you don't need all the complicated bells and whistles of the other programs this is a good one.
1,SONOFAGUN!,"I rec'd the software today, but I am returning it tomorrow. Why? The software is not ""recognizable"".I'm sure it IS a good program ... if only it could be downloaded!!"
4,NTI CD & DVD Maker 7,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007GHGHC/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_imgReceived product in record time! Great doing business with these people. Have not used the product as yet but am looking forward to doing that in the very near future.
5,Very Good and simple to use,I was using Nero brfore getting this program. It doesn't have all the bells and whistles as Nero but it is a lot easier to use. It is also cheaper than Nero. If you need a good simple program for burning CDs and DVDs this is the one.
1,Disappointing.,"Just purchased this software to turn my homemade movies into DVDs. The software doesn't recognize my videos downloaded onto the computer because they are in AVI format. I used the free SDcopy software to change them into MPEG format, but the NTI DVD Maker tells me they are now in MPEG-1 format, and they need to be in MPEG-2. In order to convert them into MPEG-2 files I'll need to buy an additional MPEG-2 plug-in from NTI on their website for $15. Now, I'm new to this whole digital video thing and in my naivete I expected the NTI CD/DVD Maker to handle all aspects of DVD burning. Kind of one-click-does-it-all deal. Apparently it does not, and it requires the additional purchase of a video file converter. This is disappointing, and I just started with this software. I'm wondering if there's anything better out there in the market."
1,Not What I Expected,"I purchased this product to use primarily to back up and copy my photo files to DVD. As a serious photographer I shoot in RAW and after editing I save in TIFF. However, the designers of this product in their infinite wisdom decided to support just the JPEG format. Therefore I cannot use it to copy photo files, which renders this producr totally useless to me. If anyone reading this knows of a product that will do what I need please let me know at VMPALEST@gmail.com Victor m Palacios"
2,Disappointing if you want to cultivate these plants,"I was under the impression that this book would provide the information I needed to cultivate these plants on some scale. I was very disappointed. There is no way that you could reliably produce these plants with the information provided in this book. There are much better books out there for that purpose. If you are a novice, homegardener wanting to learn about wildflowers and grow a few in your backyard, this book would be okay for you. But if you are knowledgeable on the topic already, I think you will be disappointed."
5,Would give it 6 stars,"The author provides understandable explanations regarding soil and weather conditions. Although I am very experienced in growing wildflowers, I was impressed with the guidelines for propagating native flowers from cutting and seed. Although more detailed information for individual species may be available online as one reviewer indicated, I find the book very useful. My wildflowers are in an isolated region where there is no internet or WiFi readily available. I have purchased the other books in the series - love 'em."
5,Refreshing new band with Eastern rhythms and Western groove,"Thank God for small favors. Just when I thought ""new music"" was a thing of the past - The Rotating Leslies walk into my life. What a wonderfully talented ensemble. The album flows from the opening song ""Awake"" to the closing song ""Asleep"" while taking you on a hypnotizing, funky journey of intelligent, well crafted songs. This is a music lover's CD - Eastern rhythms interwoven with funky bass lines, wonderfully grinding Eastern chord progressions, a la Zeppelin's ""Kashmir"", creating a grooving sound so sexy it's hard to believe they didn't stop there...but the Rotating Leslies are about layering their sound, so the addition of french horn, piano and ethereal female vocals take this CD to the next level of excellence. Enjoy, play it loud-from start to finish-listen to the lyrics, and let their mystical optimism fill the room."
5,Incredible!,This is the most important Gnostic work in my library. It is an invaluable reference book. This Gnostic Gospel of Jesus in its simplistic beauty is clear and easy to understand. This is a great affordable copy of an essential work.
2,Bad layout,"This book has the titles that (I assume aren't part of the text) run almost seamlessly into the body of the text so one ends up reading titles as if part of the body text, I don't know what other copies of Pistis Sophia are like but if you are considering buying Pistis Sophia I would suggest a different edition.Pistis Sophia is of course historically important not only simply because it is an ancient Gnostic text but because this was -if I am correct- the only Gnostic work that scholars had basically in full to understand Gnosticism from (apart from of course what the Church Fathers accurately reported to of course) until the Nag Hammadi finds.As to the work itself Pistis Sophia is of course a book of vile lies."
2,Pistis Sophia,"Other versions may have been written better, text lacks consistancy with too many thee's and thou's. Unfortunately due to the lack of flow in the text, it can very easily be one of those books you put down and forget to pick up again."
3,Good,"Very revealing. To learn even more about the Pistis Sophia, try The Pistis Sophia Unveiled. (0974591688)"
5,This music rocks!,"Once you buy Love In the Ruins, it will quickly become the soundtrack of your life. Whatever you're feeling---ecstatically angry or mesmerizingly confused---this music will match your mood.Bonnie Hayes' songwriting style is both intelligent and amusing. Her songs are bawdy, caustic, and celebratory and her vocal range is incredible. Ms. Hayes is able to hit those high notes in one moment, then sing in a low and sultry voice the next moment.This CD is a party waiting to happen. You should buy it---people will suddenly like you and think you're cool!!"
3,Not her best....,"I'm a big Bonnie Hayes fan but I have to admit to prefering her Wild Combo albums to the more recent stuff. This latest effort starts out wonderfully with Beautiful Ideal, but it's basically down hill from there. It's great to see that Good Clean Fun has finally been re-issued, now as a CD. I wore out my vinyl copy years ago. Pick that one up instead of this and prepare to smile..."
2,Delicious When Not Expired,"As evidenced by other reviewers' comments across the entire Balance Bar product range, Amazon sometimes ships out expired boxes of these otherwise tasty energy bars. The price was right though, so I took a gamble in March 2006 and received a box that had expired in December 2005. Amazon gladly processed my return and replaced them with another box...from December 2005. Your best bet, unless you relish gnawing through stale, rock-hard nougat, is to procure them elsewhere."
1,"There is no Chocolate, Mint, or Cookie flavor to be found.","I like some of the other Balance Gold bars, specifically the triple chocolate is good, as well as the peanut butter. Peanut cluster is also decent. However, avoid the Chocolate Mint Cookie. It tastes like muddy, minty sawdust."
2,A Little Stale Upon Arrival,"Although this product arrived with a valid expiration date, the bar was a little bit stale. Second box on the way, will review later."
1,Terrible,These are just awful. The taste is bad and they arrived half melted (thanks Amazon). Just avoid these - go for the Balance Bare bars...
1,Not what I hoped for,"I always considered the Polk brand as an upscale choice.These speakers sound like they are just there making noise.Audio is like wine; hard to describe but easy to enjoy if it is done well.I wanted to have a small home theater setup for a Mitsubishi LCD TV and have music channels play without the TV on.I have a higher end Sony receiver and tried the speakers; flat dead uninspired sound like a boombox came out.This led me to try way too many choices on the equalizer etc.Since it sounded like a boombox I pulled the detachable speakersfrom my five year old Panasonic boombox; they were clearly better as was the sound from the small Mitsubishi TV speakers, an old pair of Kenwood and outdoor Bose speakers.Every setting and every speaker we tried was superior to thisPolk even after a lot of messing with the receiver.Maybe no one can make smaller speakers that sound real.Best luck in your search but I suggest you pass on this model."
5,Good and Excellent Condition,"I am pretty satisfied of this product, i love the condition it was in, its pretty brand new, not one scratch, i recommend anybody in canada or fewer states of people should buy it, i loved it, just what i was looking for, so thanks Amazon.com!, i will buy more other merchandise that i see's good to buy online on your site, thank you, Myles T."
3,Not the greatest tribute album...,"I bought a used copy of this CD on Amazon, and I have to say it might only appeal to hard-core Beatles Covers collectors like myself (if there are any others...)Some of the tracks demonstrate the perils of covering Beatles songs: 1) merely duplicating the original, as Badmouth does with ""Magical Mystery Tour"" or 2) straying too far from the original as the Bari Koral Band does with ""Can't Buy Me Love"".That said, some of these covers strike the right balance, namely Run For Cover's ""Let it Be"", The Mystic's ""Hello Goodbye"", Bubba Zeus' ""Dear Prudence"" and Fallen Angel's ""Back in the U.S.S.R.""Also, 100 Proof Band's version of ""While My Guitar Gently Weeps"" sounds even more Clapton-esque than the original.I thought some of these covers sounded familiar - turns out 5 of them also appear on an album called ""Beatlejuice - A Big Apple Tribute to the Beatles"", which is a much better album. Consider tracking that one down instead."
2,Very Boring!!!,"I received this as a Christmas present a few years ago, and finally decided to watch it last night. It was not worth the wait. I found this movie to be incredibly boring, and slow. A businessman named John Stone receives a package in the mail from London. It's two old large bottles of brandy filled with vampire blood. Everytime he drinks it, he slowly transforms into a vampire. I would not recommend A TASTE OF BLOOD!!!"
3,Great Title Track - The Rest Is OK.,"I love 'Turn On To Love' - it's a 17 minute disco Opus that ranks up there with 'Love To Love You Baby' by Donna Summer, 'Love In C Minor' by Cerrone, and 'Accidental Lover' by Love & Kisses. It's disco before it became programmed, santized, and monotonous. The rest of this CD is okay. Getting the full version of the title track, though, is reason why I give it 3 instead of 2 or 1, if there was only a shorter version of the song."
3,Overpriced,33% of this book is a review of the Tony Oz stock scanner. This section is available free on his web site.33% of this book is his personal story33% of this book explains his trading stratey and money management.For the price I think it is a rip off though you will pick up some good points
1,too simple to work,"The technique is mostly about support&resistance.;It is hard to expect such simple techniques to workin a complicated environment and actually make money.Tony might have incorporated his own experience intohis trading, which is simply not described in the book.I doubt anybody could make a living through tradingbased on support&resistance.; I have paper-tradedin my account, however I was consistently losing money.Therefore I decided to throw this book away."
1,Don't waste your time,This is just an expensive ad for the author's 2 other books. The chapters have the names of some of his stock scans but if you expect to get the parameters of those scans you will be sadly mistaken. The author's excuse is that he has already published the formulas in his other books and because of copyright laws cannot give it to you. If you want it buy the other books (HUH??). Save your money this is an expensive price for a few pages of printing.
4,Cool Book ...........but dated,Tony Oz was at the top of his game then. I dont know what happen? Now he is on You tube and other free sites doing all types of ads and selling dated CD seminars. He has some online school also. He needs to write a new book that address daytrading in a more recent time frame. This book does not discuss futures at all. Very few day traders trade exclusively stocks. Just take the info from the book and exchange it for futures and it is a A minus in a my book.
5,Best of his books,This one was by far better than his other 2 books. Very straight forward and gives very practical suggestions. Its great for intermediate level traders as well giving them a process to follow.
2,deja vu,"""Stock Trading Wizard"" + ""The Stock Trader"" = ""How to Take Money from Wall Street"". Better: How to take money from YOU.No RT user? Sorry, the Oz scanner is useless (- 100 pages). Anyway you can search for formulas in the previous books.Oz free (?!?) calculator ? Who cares ? (-50 pages).Techical Analysis: candlestick charts? Bollinger Bands? Support and Resistence? Again? The same ""Stock Trading Wizard"" pages.No new strategies, no new ideas. Business as usual. My time is up."
1,Way Over-Priced!,I purchased this exact LPS at Target last week. It was in the checkout lane for $2.99!
1,disappointed,"I payed a lot of money for the Vocopro Duet. I was happy with the features and sound quality, but the CD player quit working properly before the first year. I contacted the company and they sent me another one. I was able to use the new one for two years and then the CD player gave out completely (no longer under warranty). I took it to a shop to fix it and it would have cost me just as much to fix it as it would to buy a new one. I was very disappointed in the quality of this product. I now have about $500.00 worth of CDGs and no system to play them with. I am very hesitant to buy another VocoPro product."
3,PRETTY GOOD SOUND,"This system sounds good and we like it. The speaker is quiet good and has enough put out for in home practice for sure. The only complaint I have about it is the fact that you can only record yourself singing along with a CD onto a cassette. I thought that it would be capable of letting someone record themselves singing along with another cassette karaoke tape because it has two tape decks. If you don't mind buying karaoke music CD's to practice by this unit is great. However, CD,s are quite exspensive and that,s why I only give it a 3 star rating because I wanted to use karaoke cassettes as well. I called customer service and was told that vocopro has recently made a unit that will do this feature but I could not find one so I am keeping this one."
3,Sounds good but not user friendly,"Had it for 1 month, sound quality is great but difficult to jump from song to song. Didn't use the tape deck and a few other features on it yet but after reading these reviews, I will use them to make sure they work!"
3,cassette tape,The sound system is great and enjoyed listening to the radio and cd. I still like to use cassette tape to record and was happy that this equipment had the dual cassette function... but after recording on the 4th tape the speed slowed down and eventually raveled the tape. Also the eject button on the other side became frozen and pressing about 5x it will eject.I think cassette tapes will be extinct soon.
1,Terrible product,"When I tried to open the left tape deck for the first time, it skewed and was not never able to close.As the right side deck is working I am using right deck only."
1,Singing the blues,"For the price, I expected a higher quality product. The cassette tape door has to have a little help when it is asked to open. Very cheap material. Not enough options for connecting it to other electronics."
1,This sucks!!!,"I paid a lot of money to buy this for my wife for Christmas. It literally worked for 1 day. We bought brand new cds the next day and reading error. The unit wouldn't even turn the disc, I am soooo angry and mad. DO NOT GET THIS SYSTEM! You may be a lucky one and not have issues, but according to a lot of other 1 star reviews, apparently this happens pretty often, so look for another one unless you want to play the lottery and hope you win."
4,VocPro Duet been a good machine,"I'm surprised to read the negative reviews about this little machine. I bought one for my Mom in 1999 and it has been wonderful. Only recently (October 2012) have we begun to have problems with the CD not playing. It will play if just the right amount of pressure is applied to the cover, thus, it must be a problem with the little shocks or the felt pad that sits on top of the CD. I am going to contact tech support for troubleshooting advise and try repairing it myself because it has been such a good machine."
2,smells funny,"If it does nothing else, I do like the camphor-y feel it gives if you leave it on for a while...it makes me remember to eat right. I am not sure it has any other effect...and the odorless claim...well, let's just say it isn't odorless and leave it at that."
2,Not the miracle cream,"I received a different bottle cream from the company but the same formula. The smell of the cream is awful! I cannot even begin to describe how bad it is. After washing my hands a couple of times the smell was still there and my clothes had to be watch a couple of times. If the product would have worked, the smell would've been tolerable but not even that."
1,Absolute worst tea,"I you like the taste of hot water,this tea is for you.After tasting a few different flavors all well before their expiration date I think that 2000 year old tea found in the pyramids would have more flavor than ANY revolution tea.Stay far away from this vial product.Horrible customer service."
3,Weaker than I had hoped.,"I am used to making tea from loose leafs and was hoping I wouldn't have to deal with the mess so much. The nylon(?) bag/steeper that this tea comes in is (in terms of cleanup) better than paper based bags and some infusers. Unfortunately, I am disappointed by the strength at a normal brew length (and even a bit longer) compared to the brew I get from a tsp of Engl. Bfast leaves I get locally.I will finish these bags up but will go back to the stainless tea ball / paper flip bags & loose tea from the corner shop when I do finish them."
4,Rockin with Sweet Honey!,"This is a great cd. There are one or two pieces that I wasn't that thrilled with, but overall I give this a strong recommendation. This group is amazing, talented, and create music like I've never heard. It will get into you and you won't be able to let it go!"
3,"A short, but outdated biography","I read this book here in Brazil.This book is short and concise.Even as an introduction about Stalin's life, this book has many failures.This book has nothing about Cazaquisthan massive genocide by Stalin, in 1930 decade.Stalinism was out from eastern Europe, decades after this book to be published."
4,This CD is just plain cool,"I recently got the chance to review this album, and I was really impressed. Buddy Jewell is a great singer, and really belts these tunes out. If you like Buddy Jewell already, just stop reading here and buy the album.The album is really easy to listen to all the way through, but several of the songs are really top notch. ""So Hard to Be Strong"" has one of the best lines in country music....but I won't spoil it for you. ""I get the bird"" is hilarious, almost on the level of Joe Diffie's ""John Deere Green"", and ""Downtown Matinee"" is a great reminiscence of a song. If you like Radney Foster's ""DEl Rio, TX, 1959"" album, you'll love this song and the whole album.The songs on this album are great, and the vocals are tremendous. It's got that old-timey country music feel with all the benefits of modern recording and songwriting. Just like driving around in a restored 1956 convertible....with air conditioning and a CD player! It's great!"
5,Musically Minded,"I rate this album, excellent. I first saw Buddy Jewel onNashville Star. I am normally not a big country music fan,however, watching Buddy Jewel on Nashville Star, I beganto really enjoy his music and became interested in some ofhis other work.I fell in love with ""Tales of the New West"". I really enjoyover half of the songs on this album. Since I purchased,""Tales of the New West"", I seem to listen to it over and overagain. Not only do I enjoy Buddy as a singer, but the lyricsare very well written, which is what makes the songs so enjoyable. Thank you."
5,Musically and Ethically Great!,"I agree with Ma Hubbard that this album is musically very good, if not great. However, I disagree regarding the ethics involved. I personally know the songwriters (The Corey Family) who financed this whole project themselves and paid Buddy a substantial amount of money for his participation. Furthermore, they have a contract with Buddy to pay him royalties for every album sold and the royalty rate is three times what Sony or any other record company would typically pay. THIS IS NOT A BOOTLEG ALBUM.. To the contrary, Buddy stands to gain more financially than any other person involved with this album and I heartily recommend it to any of his fans."
3,OK Effort,"Buddy surprised me with this CD. It had a different sound to his previous hits. A more subdued, relaxed sound. I think I like the Buddy Jewel written songs better and the real Buddy Jewel sound better as well. Whilst it is still easy to listen to, it just didn't grab me like his first album."
2,HP alignment trouble,"Worked good for first year, then started having trouble with ""paper too narrow messages"" despite reseting the paper selector and using HP paper. Now in addition to that, It is apparently gone out of alignment and will not enter the alignment mode because of the ""paper too narrow"" message. Have to finish work on the cheaper HP1210. Not sure I would buy HP again."
1,Boring,"This book must be the worst of all Archer's works. Most of his books are really good reads, but please give this one a miss."
2,I concur-- bring the original releases to CD,"We need the original releases in chronological order. There's no sense including poor live recordings while omitting perfectly good studio tracks. ""Power"" is like a pizza with no tomato sauce."
4,"SSD ""Power"" not that bad","In the fall of 1985 I held the ""Get it Away"" vinyl album in my hands but decided to buy some other record instead. Dang! Over the years I've heard a handful of SSD songs and had a tape of some of their stuff but it wasn't till 2012 that I got ""Power"" and had this many of their songs at my disposal. If this is all the band wants to release, then I'm happy to have at least this since it has their ""hit"" songs. The problem is that the flow of the whole CD is broken up by mixing the live tracks with studio tracks. I don't see the purpose of the live tracks at all. I can look past that though. This is a pretty good record overall. My absolute biggest complaint would be that there are no real liner notes. I think that this project deserves some notes about the band's history with photos and flyers and maybe reproductions of the album covers that these songs were culled from - it would make this a much better well-rounded record."
4,WORM,I had purchase this book along with several others to give as gifts to family friends. I should not write a review of the book as I would be very biased. the Auther is my Daughter. I thought the book was great. The several places I purchased the book from delivered exactly as promised.
5,Homecoming - A Prophetic Study of Ruth,"Through the lives of two women, Jew and Gentile, Julie immerses the reader in God's prophetic plan for the world. As they journey together, His plan for restoration and wholeheartedness unfolds - for all of us. This is a fascinating in-depth study, brilliantly written, yet easy to understand. I recommend it highly for mature Christians, men and women alike, who are seeking a new dimension in their walk with the Father."
1,Dont waste your money.,"This is junk to any audiophile. The sound quality is very poor ie. distorted. Switches are unreliable, and there is no way to use external power so it eats batteries."
2,A Big Disappointment,"Despite glowing reviews from the other reviewers, I was disappointed in this CD. My daughter didn't like it at all, and got bored within a few minutes. It was too spartan, with little musical accompaniment. Most annoying was that all of the songs were a bit too slow, even popular songs that all children sing seemed as if they were recorded at half-speed...it made each song sound depressing and way to similar to all the other songs. I guess I was expecting something happy and upbeat (more Raffi-like) and the CD put us to sleep."
4,"Very mellow, but wonderful!","I first found this at the library last year, and had to go ahead and buy my own copy. I would say that she has a Joni Mitchell sort of voice, and that it's very low key. But I appreciate that sort of thing! Some of the songs are supposed to by finger plays, which is great. I also LOVE that she does the version of 'happy and you know it' that includes 'if you're mad/sad/silly and you know it'. I don't hear that version as often, but it's an important one!"
1,couldn't hear the cd at all. Threw it out.Defective.,"My children ,all in their twenties and late teens, loved this on tape in the eighties and early nineties. I was so disappointed when I attempted to play it for my first grandchild. There was no sound.We are enjoying the other cds that we ordered at the same time."
2,Not that great,"I have to agree with some others in that this CD is very slow. In fact, it puts my kids to sleep rather than provoke a sing along or dance. Lisa Monet doesn't have a bad voice but the CD sounds as though you were back in the 70's with the wiggly voice and single guitar music. If you are looking for a CD that is calming and somewhat boring than this is your CD. I haven't found a great kids CD yet, but this definitly was NOT not even close."
2,More like a travelogue film,"The description of this film says surprisingly little about it, so I thought I'd try to give a better sense of what it actually contains.Basically, it is a tour of various sites around India: where the Buddha was born, where he obtained enlightenment, etc. At each location, some non-native pilgrims/tourists are followed, and their experiences, thoughts, and observations are filmed and shown here. Interspersed within each section are some brief scenes with an actor portraying the historical Buddha (as shown on the cover picture for the DVD).As the other reviewer observed, the film doesn't have a whole lot to teach; some of the most important moments in Buddha's life are covered far too quickly to be of much use (his enlightenment for example). Overall, it seemed more like a filmed travelogue than anything intended to be instructional about the Buddha or Buddhism."
5,Wakeman - In the beginning,"Another classic Wakeman CD. This man is the master of all keyboardists, whether playing rock, classical, or new age music. THE MASTER!"
2,Not the best sundial book available,"I found Rohr not to be as useful as the two other texts by Waugh or Mayall and Mayall. The other books are more clear and practical in the constructions of many different types of dials.The only strength of the Rohr test is the explanation of (i) drawing hour lines on any surface so long as you have a rod shaped gnomen and (ii) the construction of babylonian and Italian hours. Even so the explanation of the babylonian and Italian hours could be better.So the Rohr book would best be used as an adjunct to the other texts but if you are just starting out, buy the book by Waugh first then Mayall and Mayall and then perhaps Rohr if your library hasn't got it."
4,Another great classic on sundial construction...,This book is another of the must-have's for anyone interested in understanding or building sundials. It has a lot of the theory behind how they work and how to make some of the different types of dials. I recommend this title highly!
4,Tobias Bias,"I appreciate Sheila Tobias and her work; however, this book is stilted to give more of a negative commentary toward young feminisms. In fact, it's quite dismissive of a post-second wave feminist movement or ideology.The work is expansive and indeed offers a reflection of a big name in the field of women's studies. And, the book is worth reading, but with the warning that it exudes an at times part of that sanctimonious ""mother"" explaining what she has done and how you the ""daughter"" should be grateful.I can't help but also personalize this book based on her immediate and loud exit from Rebecca Walker's talk at Smith College. Even if Tobia didn't mean to do so--her exit looked like-- the roundtable wasn't worth her listening to.This book is written for an academic audience in Women's Studies, Women's History, and the like."
2,so so,Pickin Led Zep volume one is excellent. This second volume fall quite a bit short from the first one. Sometimes all the t's are crossed and the i's are dotted and something is missing. This CD lacks inspiration. The first volume has some the best bluegras musicians aroung today and the second volume doesn't have the same line up. It basically done by David West from California. Basically any pickin on CD that is done by this guy lacks inspiration sorry to say.
2,Not as good as Volume 1,"Every cut on Volume 1 was excellent--not so here. In Fact, Misty Mountain Hop doesn't sound at all like the Led Zeppelin song, which should have been an album highlight. Notice also that Volume 2 was made 3 years after Volume 1 and essentailly by a single artist. Volume 1 had a rich selection of top-notch musicians.In summary, good bluegrass music but it doesn't capture the sound or spirit of Led Zeppelin."
1,barska deep 7x50,I am really disappointed. When I removed the binoculars I was very impressed with the design and heft. The directions were useless and in calling customer service I received a similar useless set of directions. The battery insertion was impossible to figure out and the compass and light never worked. I am sending them back (pain). I like to try another Barska model but I am really reluctant after this experience.
2,Poor instrucctions for use very complex rangefinder,"I order by mistake this Barska binoculars,I didnt try yet comes with a pair of batteries whats for covers they are imposible to hold in place. Tell me batteries are for.......... And the range finder take to much time doing calculationsThe vision is good, I give 2 1/2 stars due to the confuse instruccion and I have to keep against my interest because is to expensive to return to USA from the Dominican Republic,probably more value than the binoculars."
5,A treasure,"I recall reading this book when I was a young girl (I checked it out of the library at our synogogue). A couple years back I found it again and bought it to read to my children. My oldest (now almost 4) found it and has enjoyed listening to it for the past several months. She loves hearing the stories of the old gandmother, and it has prompted her to ask to hear stories about our relatives who are no longer with us. I think it also helps her to reflect upon, and appreciate her relationship with her grandparents. We usually only read a chapter or two at a time, but we have read the book several times over by now. She will often ask for the ""Grandma Goldina"" book, and I would place it among her favorites. I know that we will be reading and enjoying it for many years to come. The ending is beyond her at this point, and I don't spell it out for her, but I'm sure when she is old enough to figure it out, she will be old enough to accept it."
5,Should have been Vol. 1,"I own a good portion of the TZ series and this is my favorite so far. All three episodes are top notch, but The Printer's Devil is the best episode here. The only thing that could make any TZ DVD better is if they released all the Burgess Meredith episodes on one disc. Nightmare as a Child was always a favorite of mine and is a great episode. And I was surprised to find another episode I hadn't seen.Person or Persons Unknown all I can say GREAT."
5,Rare American Culture - The Musical Theatre,"This combination of talents reflects the best of the now extinct American Musical. Amazing music by Jule Styne, clever and sophisticated presentation by Comden & Green and great casting. The film version was no comparison and this live restored recording showcases Judy Holliday and Sydney Chaplin in the 50's style we would all like to recapture."
4,Unforgettable Judy Holliday,"Supposedly Judy Holliday was terrified about performing in this (an enormous Broadway hit) because she believed she ""couldn't sing""; yet, while her tone is not pure, she can put over a number with the best of them through her sheer joyful spirit and inestimable comic talent. Although the minor numbers performed by Eddie Foy, Jr. and Jean Stapleton are sometimes minor indeed, this show elicited several great Styne standards, including ""Long Before I Met You,"" ""Just in Time,"" and of course ""The Party's Over"", while the dazzling ""Drop That Name"" shows you just how good Comden and Green at their best can really be. But the show, in the end, is really Holliday's, and her great eleven-o'-clock number, ""I'm Going Back,"" is certainly something to hear."
4,It's For You!,"""Bells are Ringing"" is a classic 1950's musical comedy with several standards, including ""Just in Time"" and ""The Party's Over"". Jule Styne, Betty Comden and Adolph Green wrote the score. The Comden & Green lyrics are clever, and Styne wrote one of his most melodic scores. Judy Holiday is a comic doll as Ella Peterson, the telephone answering service girl who meddles in the lives as her customers. The big mystery of the show is the male lead, Sydney Chaplin. He won a Tony for his role, but he can't sing!"
4,Pray TV Nails the Early Religious TV Era.,"I saw this movie shortly after it first came out twenty-odd years ago, and loved it then. Besides its being a quick paced and funny effort, it really captures some of the machinations of the early religious TV players. Complete with a Charles Haid as the ""Drive-In Movie Evangelist,"" who is a combination of Robert Schuller and Gene Scott along with his ""Brother John"" accompanist who could be a knock-off of Scott's bearded head musician, Ron Spaan. Jack and Jeannie and their ""Jump for Jesus"" show could be either Jan and Paul Crouch or Jim and Tammy Baker. But, the auditions for ""talent"" for the new KGOD religious format is worth the price of admission. And Dove/Devo...how funny is that! All in all a very entertaining if forgotten movie that anyone who lived through it, will love."
1,Amateur hour at CalArts,"Be warned, if you're considering this, it looks like something thrown together during a lunchbreak or two at some high school. There's absolutely zero entertainment value, zero ""art,"" zero behind-the-scenes revelations of Mike Kelley. I'm pretty familiar with Kelley and other artists of his ilk... but this looks like something he might have thrown together in 8th grade. There's nothing to look at, nothing to decipher or think over."
4,One final hoorah,"Magic Theater is the last studio album to be released by Shadowfax. The founder of the band, Chuck Greenburg, died the year after its release thus ending the legacy of some of the most unique and original music I have ever heard. Magic Theater is a fitting end to the legacy of Greenburg & company. Thank you, Chuck, for the beautiful music you have given to me. It has touched my heart forever and always."
4,these are the ones,"I like all there cds, they were my 1st introduction to music off the beaten path. from here i went to pat methenny,mahavisnu,flowerkings,naicin,and so on snd on i go. thanks"
5,better to see once than hear a hundred times,"a quick way to learn basic street safety skills, primarily situation awareness and timely recognition of certain behaviorsseveral typical scenarios are getting analyzed over and over again, every time from a different perspective"
2,Not really low-carb or easy,"These recipes are not what I would consider low-carb. Maybe ""lower-carb"" but not low, and with their long lists of ingredients I wouldn't consider them easy either. I am returning the book."
2,Those little elves are...,"Living like trillionaires, for what the high cost of Keeblers is. I found that the taste was a bit better than the store brand and there is no question to that, but the cost is just not worth the small difference.I wouldnt suggest a hit and run over one elve, may decrease the cost as there productivity should go up with fewer working elves.You know like the rest of us in this country, that need to work ten times as hard, to just make ends meet."
4,Plug and play,"Works well, import direct to ACT works well. Some manual adjustment to data being imported has to be done since not all data is placed in the correct field. Not a huge problem, still much faster than manual entry. Imported 150 cards in 1 1/2 hours."
3,Chillstream,I used it for 2 hours today while playing Resistance and noticed it does indeed keep your hands from sweating but that's about all it does. The speed control button only works when it wants to and the d-pad gets stuck either in the up or down directions almost every time you try to use it. It also didn't feel as responsive as the SIXAXIS. My biggest complaint though is that there is no PS button! There is no way to go back to the ps3's main menu when you are playing a game or watching a movie without the PS button. You can't even power on/off the system with this controller. Inventive idea but with many flaws.
2,Lame - don't buy this.,I got this out of desparation but then found out there is no PS3 button - this renders this thing completely useless except it has a fan which addresses the problem of sweaty hands (what?)
2,Fits hands much better.... goes dead with PS2 games,"I bought this controller because the Sony controllers are real small and do not fit my hands well. The Chillstream does fit much better and the fans are great.However, as in the other reviews... the controller goes dead when trying to run PS2 games on my PS3. Also, as mentioned no PS button. I've worked around this by having the Sony controller plugged in the #2 controller spot. This works fine with PS3 games and you canI think Logitech will update their controller soon...but this on is exactly like the PS2 Chillstream and is not worth the Greenbacks at this time.RKip"
2,You should by the Dual Shock 3,"This product is, but not worth the money, there are a few buttons, after 6 months of very light use, stopped working consistently. I don't like how the L2, R2 buttons feel, the official controller is way better, and I wish it was wireless. This would be a 3 or 4 except for the fact that a few of the buttons don't work very well."
2,Chillstream,"The fans are great, but as others have said, there is no PS button. That renders this thing useless. Also, it lacks the real triggers on the front. Overall a neat idea with the fan, but an utter lack of execution. Disappointed..."
1,Its stupid,wtf?There is no ps button and mine broke the first week i got a logetec controller insded ur going to wast ur $$ if u buy it buy a sony or a logetec controller
5,Awesome,"This book is a one of a kind book, its contents are explained in the lowest level possible a five year old kid would be able to grasp the concept. The author of this book knows how to teach. I am enjoying every minute of this book, oh and mind you I hate reading. Thank you."
5,really good book,i'm totally unexperienced on how helicopters work and i think this book gives you a great idea about the principles of helicopter flight
2,meh,I bought this book to prepare for the U.S Army AFAST test. I would not recomend this book for AFAST review.
3,Not what I ordered,I ordered the Principles of Helicopter Flight - Syllabus. The picture shows that title. They shipped the non-syllabus version. They have different ISBNs.
1,Worse than nothing,"As a physicist and mathematician, I can say this is the most poorly written, confusing, self-contradictor, error filled piece of junk I have ever had the misfortune to encounter. My wife (a PhD in Chemistry) and I tried to use it as a learning tool for our ppl and felt that we were worse off than with nothing."
3,Funny as hell,Ok so a friend of mine and I got this because of the one song called Cuba. None of the songs on here made any sense but I tell you if want a good laugh this bud's for you. The lead singer's voice is gruff and looking at them on the cover as if they did some shit wonderful makes it worth getting.
2,another waste of money,First I did not like the smell of this product. Also it did absolutely nothing for my face except make it oilier than usual. i will not e purchasing this again. Nice container though...
2,Not worth the money,I have used this cream for 22days and no change in the way my skin look the dark spots are still there...Not happy at all with this item...The only thing I liked was the container it came in..
4,The western horse captured to perfection,"I have been a fan of David Stoecklein's work for many years, and he continues to outdo himself with each new endeavor. This book is no exception. His love of horses and the west, combined with his overall vision, unique photographic eye and technique make this book truly exceptional. The variety of shots and his use of angles and light will keep you turning each page with anticipation. You feel as if you have snuck into the horses world, without the horse knowing that you are there. He successfully captures the western horse in a way that portrays them as they are: stunning, magnificent animals, deserving our our appreciation and respect. Even those who are not 'horse' fans per se, will appreciate the depth and breadth of Mr. Stoecklein's style."
2,western horse,The material in this book was great. The copy that I received was a second. The pages were not finished and the pages were folded. I would not buy from this source again.
3,Warning: Male to Male,"This page says it is a male to female adapter, but it is actually male to male."
5,"Man has been in the Americas for at least 50,000 years !","In Brazil, there are archeological sites dating from 48,000 BC in the Northeast Region. The pre-historical people that lived in palaphits on the lakes of the ""Baixada"" Region of Maranho State, plus the ""Seven Cities"" and ""Capivara Mountain"" Historical National Parks in the State of Piaui and ""Lagoa Santa"" in the State of Minas Gerais, are widely recognized presences of ancient men in Brazil much earlier than the North American sites. There are new thesis that men first came to the American from Africa to the Northeast cost of Brazil. And not from Asia through the Behring Strait or through the Pascoa Island in the Pacific. I think it is quite possible that we were in the Americas eight million years ago - why not ?"
1,Is this science fiction?,"Alleged discovery of 3 to 8 million-year-old woodworking tools in North America stretches credultity beyond the breaking point. Archeologists are beginning to accept the possibility that there were humans in the western hemisphere as early as 50 thousand years ago, but even this is still controversial. The Clovis culture of approximately 10,500 BC is the earliest on which there is broad concensus. Even in Africa, the most primitive Olduwan stone tools are only 2.5 million years old or so."
1,Only the probe?,"Called Tech for Less, but the sales agent wasn't too familiar with this item and could not give me a definitive answer, he recommended I contact APC. Tried to call APC support for a concrete answer, but today they're on holiday. This model doesn't appear on the APC home page, but according to our local APC distributor, this model # AP9619U is only the probe.The AP9619 does include the card (and has a similar list price), so I'm not sure if the AP9619U is a typo for AP9619? In either case, I think there is some false/misleading advertising here, so like always, be careful.To be continued.."
4,Wellesley College president as poet,"Born in Rhode Island, Caroline Hazard (1856-1945) is best-known for being the fifth president of Wellesley College in the years 1899 to 1910. Although she had no advanced degree, she was a successful fundraiser and the college prospered under her presidency. She wrote her first book of poetry in 1894. After she retired she spent her winters in Santa Barbara, California. Songs in the Sun contains short poems on the nature and beauty of Rhode Island and California, especially flowers. It is illustrated with her landscapes and flowers."
1,Ouch!,"The Schick Quattro Titanium Razor just put a 3-inch slice in my cheek and caused a bloody mess. Thank goodness it wasn't shaving my throat. The top blade came out of the side holder and stuck up to give a nasty razor cut (in fact, two nasty cuts). Nope, I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone who wants to avoid razor cuts, copious amounts of blood, pain, and facial disfigurement. Using this product is dangerous and an incentive to buy a Norelco."
1,Good shave with new blades but very hard to clean,"I have been very disappointed with the Quattro and will switch to a different razor once I use all the cartridges. Though the shave is good with new cartridges, I have a great deal of trouble cleaning the hairs out from between the blades. Hot water from my faucet simply isn't enough. With former razors (Ultrex twin blade), a pass along the edge with a toothpick would do it easily, but the vertical wires on the blades make it impossible to clean these cartridges efficiently, resulting in my having to spend a lot of extra time cleaning them or keep changing cartridges, which really increases the expense. Maybe someone with a hotter water setting would have better luck."
4,Two reasons to like this razor,"There are two reasons to like the Schick Quattro.The first reason is that it works well. I've always had trouble shaving the curves in the lower part of my neck, but the Quattro's abundance of blades has solved that problem.The second reason is that it finally offers Gillette some competition in the ""premium"" segment of the market. Gillette makes good products I suppose but I've always resented the company's price-skimming ways. My hope is that now that there's an alternative product in the market, Gillette may respond by pricing its two-bladed and three-bladed products more competitively."
1,What a piece of Junk.,I would like to save you the trouble that I had to go through I buying the Schick Quattro razor.It was by far the worst shave I had ever had in my life. It did cut close but only after being dragged across my face four or five times. It wasn't worth two cents. It was very rough on my face and I don't even have a thick beard. All I did was irritate my face and cut myself.It is far better to buy cheap plastic disposables. No joke they work better than that piece of junk.I got one of my friends who didn't believe me to try it and he had the same opinion.
5,Had one blade last me 10 months,These quatro blades hold an edge a very long time as long as you clean them thoroughly and keep them dry (don't store in the shower). I shave every 2-3 days and mine lasted for 10 months. I use a spray bottle to make sure I clean out between the blades after each use and I blot it dry on a towel and them keep it in the medicine cabinet.
1,Anti-clogging technology?????,"I used the schick quattro the first time and I couldn't believe how close a shave I got, I thought it was the best shaving system I had ever come across. By the second shave I noticed that it clogged too easily and I couldn't get the hair out! Unlike the Mach 3, the back end of the cartridge is inexplicably blocked! And as we all have seen the front end has those protective wires compounding the problem. I have an thick beard so I don't know if it is a common problem, but it pissed the hell out of me."
1,how do you clean it?,"I've ben shaving my entire head for 6 years. I usually use a gillette mach 3 turbo and love it but decided to try the quatro.I use a shave brush and shave soap. So I lather up and start shaving. The hair got stuck in the blades and it stopped shaving well after only a few strokes. I tried running it under water,shaking it violently under water, and even running my finger with the blades with no results. It stayed clogged. It now sits in my cabinet with the extra blade, useless. I once used a clogged bick razor and it took a chunk out of my forhead. So I went back to my trusty Mach 3 Turbo. I havent tried the auto vibrating one. Seems like a gimmick. The only worse blade I ever used was a dollar store brand. One word-OUCH!"
2,Disposable: I'm going to give mine away or trash it,"""Four blades?! Wow! Can't wait to get a better shave than the already sensational shave my Mach 3 delivers!"" ...Fast forward ...""Boy, what a disappointment this new Schick Quattro is. Yes, the shave is close, but no closer than the Mach 3. The Quattro is awkward to hold, too. But the big letdown is the comfort. I feel like I am shaving with dull blades when I use this Quattro -- even with a brand-new blade cartridge. One shave is all I need to make my decision. I am throwing this Quattro in the trash or giving it away. Or maybe I should ask Schick for my money back. Hmmm. Maybe if I had never tried the Mach 3 I wouldn't be so down on the Quattro. I mean, if you've never had a really good shave, you might think the Quattro is awesome. Alas!"""
1,"OUCH, Go buy a Mach 3 instead.","Years ago, I shaved with the Schick FX Diamond, I liked it. Then I moved on the the Gillette Mach 3, marked improvement and have been happy with that for years. Now I come to the ""next generation"" of razors. I thought it would be a decent product because of the quality of the Diamond. I couldn't be more wrong. I can not remember the last time I cut myself shaving. It felt as rough as those plastic ones you buy in 20 packs. I took one swipe with it and wanted to stop completely, unfortunately I did not have another razor handy. It felt like rubbing sand paper on already sensitive skin and it didn't even shave closely. I will NEVER use this razor again. I want to run out and stock up on Mach 3 cartridges so I can survive until the 5 blade razor eventually comes out. Hopefully Gillete will make it."
2,Just stick to the Mach3,"I hate to make the site look like a broken record, but this razon honestly hurts to use. The Mach3 was so smoothe, and this one is like a drawn out wax job. I have never had such bad razor burn as I had with this razor. Sure, your face is smooth afterwards, but it really isn't worth it. stick to the M3."
1,gets clogged up something aweful!!,"I shave my head twice a week, and have always enjoyed the benefits of the Mach 3 Turbo. I got a free Schick Quattro sample in the mail, and decided to give it a ""wurl"". The first thing I noticed is it's not as smooth as my usual razor, and mostly it clogged up with hair SO BAD that I had to discontinue using it.Like another reviewer mentioned, there's too much ""going on"" with it behind the blades for the hair to be able to free itself. I EVEN tried using an old tooth brush to wedge the hair out, but gave up after 10 minutes."
1,Lets just pluck my beard off!,"WORST I MEAN WORST Razor i ever used in my life. Always a big fan of the Mach 3 but then Schick Quattro came out. Wow 4 blades! Going to give me a better shave... One use... 3 cuts, feeling my bread are being pluck out rather than shaving it! You know what? I rather pluck my beard off and not getting any cuts! Warbull(a reviewer) is right i wouldnt even use it to shave my dog!"
2,Restocking Fee,"Product is exactly what I wanted, but I had a negative surprise when I tried to return one of two pairs I bought. I was told there was a 20% restocking fee that would have cost me >$20 to return the product. I will NEVER again order from third party retailers through Amazon. I will only order if Amazon is the seller of the product."
3,NOT for personal use....studios- maybe,"I made the mistake of ordering these and taking the previous review lightly. I ordered these for my laptop, and they have the same kind of boxy sound (as if you are listening through a seashell) quality I was afraid of. I just dont understand all the decible range stuff. I have tried other [cheaper] KOSS models and was satisfied. These, on the other hand, must hold some other uses aside from personal leisure listening.Good side:However, they are very durable (the most durable Ive seen) and may suffice for professional studios.These headphones also do a good job of concelling outside noise, and sound much much better when listening to rock or metal as opposed to orchestral music."
2,"Uncomfortable, poor sounding.","Very bass heavy, hurt my ears to wear for extended periods. Didn't sound as good or wear as comfortably as my old, cheaper Koss headphones I was replacing."
2,All Bass,"I had the KOSS TD-80s and I was really happy with them. I hoped these would perform similarly, but they do not. These headphones are all muddy bass, and the mid-range is very muffled. To the point where I have to question what KOSS was thinking when they made these, it's ridiculous.If you care at all about hearing your music the way it is meant to sound, these are not for you. If you don't care and you're the type who turns the bass boost on your speakers all the way up, you might like these."
1,Avoid these,"These headphones don't allow the earpieces to extend enough. They fit poorly. The headband ends with two large-ish, black plastic pieces (where the silver starts) which rest fully on my head, digging into it and causing discomfort. I have to constantly move them to get relief. Fully extended, the grip is bad and the headphones still move around a lot. If I tilt my head forward or back, the headphones shift, perilously close to falling off. The sound output is also more tinny than my simple iPod earphones.Cable length is good though."
5,Best work-out DVD ever!,"This results driven, health oriented program succeeds in holding your attention, interest and motivation. I saw (more like felt!) results immediately. It also provides an option within the program for slower ramp-up, understanding everyone starts at different levels of physical ability. Highly recommended."
5,Awesome set of DVDs,This is one of my favorite sets of DVDs. It is very ballet oriented it seems with a big emphasis on strength and stretching during the workout. This might be hard on you if you have problems with your knees because there are lots of plie like movements. It relaxes me as well as helps with the flexibility and lengthens the muscles.
5,i always seem to come back to this,"i have all the dvds, but enjoy the basic essentials the best. all the work with the lower body and all the stretching really kicks my butt, no matter how fit i am at the moment. it really works. i bought this for two lazy sisters of mine, and they tried it and were amazed by how you could see an immediate difference post workout. when i finish it, i feel that my belly is much stronger and tighter. i can easily contract my muscles and i look longer and leaner...i try other dvds all the time, but this is the one i recommend to all my friends and the one i just keep going back to. whether you are a beginner or advanced, this is a decent solid workout that will benefit everyone"
4,"So far, so good",I just completed my first full workout...I did the Basic Essentials and Muscle burns fat. Even as a beginner I would have preferred if the 2 tapes were combined and instead of repeating some of the warm up and wind down segments additional exercises were added in to make it a 45 minute workout. Overall though I am very happy with the videos. I am looking forward to seeing the results in a few weeks! my muscles were shaking and I feel great having completed 2 full tapes. I will probably do this every other day and alternate with yoga on the other days.FYI...I bought this 4 VHS set at a local Borders Books for $40.00.
2,"Nice concepts - horrible, annoying instructors...","I have been a personal trainer for over ten years and I am interested in teaching Barre classes. I wanted to start with the basics so I got this set. On a positive note, the concepts are great and very effective. On the not so positive note - the instructors are absolutely annoying and bizarre! If you can get past that part - I really can't - then the workouts are effective - although they seem to be geared for the extreme beginners. There are some bonus features and you can do the workouts without narration - which I would totally do after watching it one time. Not really thrilled with this purchase."
4,"Great programmes, but too short","All four DVDs are presented by The Method's teachers with beautiful, lean, strong and flexible bodies.The instructions are easy to understand, and varied by different models: the one in front is the instructor, the one at the back on the right-side show the ""beginner level"" and the one on the left alternatives if one doesn't have a barre at home (most of us don't, I assume).I only wish the DVDs were longer. The exercises, however hard, are very enjoyable. You feel the muscles burn! I huff anf puff without leaving my mat. This is the perfect style of fitness for those who hate pure aerobics (running, spinning, etc.), like myself.Highly reccommended."
4,Lotte Berk Method for Beginners,The set of dvds is a great workout and the time goes pretty fast. I love the way I feel after the workout and the day after.. She gives a great stretch after the exercises. Not difficult for the person who hates to exercise. Still waiting for the awesome results but time will tell. I love it. All 3 dvds are a plus to your workout week. Con can't stand here voice after about 3 times. you do have the option of no voice on her dvd Pro.
4,Lotte Berke Method,"Bought the 4-CD set for a little more than $12 and it's worth every penny. It's very similar to pilates with slow small movements - however, very effective. Each workout is about 20 minutes. They use a barre for several of their exercises, but they explain how to use a piece of furniture or the wall if you don't have one available. I have the fluidity bar and it's perfect for this. If you are advanced, you may not be satisfied with these tapes because it may not be ""difficult"" enough..."
4,I certainly feel this workout the day after,"Well...I bought this because it seemed like the easiest for me. I had been a couch/computer potato for the longest time, and I needed to get up and start working out and lose some weight. This is a very low impact set that starts off easy, but each video is harder than the previous and works separate parts of the body. I certainly feel this workout after I do it. I feel it in my calves, my thighs, my shoulders and my triceps. I think this video set is a good way to start because it works on mostly stretching and lengthening your muscles. I have paired this with a cardio video and seen a difference in my stamina and muscle tone. I still ache when I do any of the workouts in this pack, but not as much as I did when I started."
2,not for a beginner!!,"Thought this might help me, but it was very intimidating. The moves are simple, but very challenging. Some I couldn't even do. I'd love to do what they wanted, but I'm not close to that level. Good luck for all you who can manage these moves. I'm sure you'll see results. Everyone else....do the Biggest Loser DVD's. Easy moves, motivating trainer (Bob), and VERY effective!!"
4,Workout,Thus far the videos are short and doable...need a bar or piece of furniture the right height. I enjoy the stretching right after.
2,Not so great,Wanted to like this but found it slow and irritating. Other videos in the same genre much better. Instructors were not anyone I care to spend time with or listen to for long. I am a veteran dance and fitness instructor and found it unappealing and with little to offer.
2,Would only suggest for beginners,"I was really disappointed with this set. I'm in pretty decent shape but have been looking for programs to increase my strength and conditioning. This dvd set does not do the job. First of all, the video is poor quality and for anyone that has a larger tv, it looks pretty awful. Also, the instructors wear these horrible outfits and talk in this patronizing annoying voice. The actual workouts are short, low in intensity and dominated by instructions. These dvds might be good for someone just beginning to workout, but anyone who already has a baseline of fitness should look elsewhere."
2,lotte berk werid,"This tape is werid all though I only have one tape from them I was confused as to when the actual work out would come, its simple Ballet moves, whats the method? dont know and the person leading the tape talks like a porn star, it was strange, overall if you turn off the sound it was a tape i may use for my slow days. Or days I just dont feel like working that hard. The ab exercises are good. but thats only 5 minutes of the tape."
1,Biggest rip-off in fitness DVDs,"The reviews on this DVD were so stellar, I decided to buy the whole set rather than try a single one first. I received only 3 DVDs, even though I ordered the set of 4. Then I discovered that all 3 programs included the same basic exercises with very minor variations. If you're interested in trying this, The Basic Essentials program contains all of the exercises. Don't bother to order any of the others. The excercises here are actually re-hashed, old style calisthenics. Very over-rated and not worth a fraction of what I payed."
4,MCSA/MCSE Self-Paced Training Kit (Exam 70-350):,The writing style is somewhat dry.The enclosed software (ISA server 120 day evaluation) and the computerized test questions make the book worth the money.
5,Incredible Band,Dexter Danger is a band i heard on a sampler cd i got at the 2003 Warped Tour and i fell in love with the songs on the CD (our anniversary and Guilty as Charged) so i searched until i ordered the CD and now i listen to it 24-7 and they're incredible.
5,They Rock!!!,"The first time I heard them was back in 2001ish. My brother came home and made me listen to Access Denied, and that was it, I was hooked. They're on my Ipod and I listen to them daily."
1,"""Le sigh.......""","I'm gonna keep it short and sweet. I pre-ordered these a while back...I know, it's gotta be the 3rd time I have ordered these. Months pass...Then the travesty that is slowly unfolding before us starts to occur. At first, I hope it to be a mock up, fake, etc. But it seems more likely now that all the changes are actually happening.So...Being a loving Star Wars fan, I did the only thing that I could. I deleted the order that I had placed for the complete box set and will GLADLY do without Lucas' P.O.S.Sigh. Coulda been great."
1,Pre-order is canceled (Make a statement with your wallet),"I was very excited about the release of Star Wars on blu-ray until George Lucas decided to get involved with the damn process. Once again he thinks making changes to the movies are for the better when in fact all he is doing is pissing off his fan base. You would think he would have learned the last time he made changes, but ""NOOOOOOOOO"". Pre-order canceled and I want nothing to do with this now. The once brilliant man has completely lost it. For anyone else who is upset about this, make a statement with your wallet. DON""T BUY."
1,Go to sleep Lucas,"Leave the legacy alone, leave the originals alone, you have to be kidding me with your additions you thought were a good idea.I have seen enough in Youtube previews.There is no way I would want this ..even for free."
5,Awesome,"Forget what all the fan boys say, this collection is awesome. This is a must have for any Star Wars fan. The picture is crisp an the sound is stunning. But what really makes this set great are the bonus features. Endless hours of behind the scenes shots and countless interviews make The Complete Saga the essential piece to a Star Wars collection."
1,Lucas should be ashamed,"Like someone addicted to plastic surgery - all the fans have ever wanted was the natural beauty of the original films. Video looks good. Audio is amazing. Shame it is all the better to see the nips and tucks that Lucas brings to his greatest creation. Stop botoxing, lip-enhancing, and ""enhancing"" these movies to death. They are starting to only faintly resemble the beautiful creation they once were...."
3,may the force be with you.,"depending on a persons point of view.sounds like i,ve heard that line somewhere before.oh well! back to my review.this version is quite different from the movie that i enjoyed much better.althought every disc might not be up to par it certainly has a broader prespective ofwhat most fan,s enjoyed about star wars when it was first released in a galaxyfar,far, away."
1,The new changes are only half the problem,"While Lucas and his wacky crew were busy pasting in new ""Nooooo!'s"" and extra rocks in front of R2D2 (how'd he get back there, anyway?!), they must have forgotten to fix all of the lightsaber color errors created in the 2004 DVD's. Oh wait.....they said they did?Two shots. Those are the only ones they fixed. Just the two shots they used in the press release........um.........WHY? People on YOUTUBE make consistent lightsaber effects. Jeesh.Not to mention that this still has all the bad color-timing (blue Hoth) that they did for the DVD's."
1,Not another dime Lucas,I'm not watching another second of CLone Wars or spending a single cent on anything Star Wars related until there is a digitally remastered Blu-Ray release of the theatrical versions of the original trilogy. George Lucas is a hack that deserves to be arrested. Anyone who walked into the Louvre and painted a moustache on the mona lisa would be locked up.
1,Noooooooooooo,"The title says everything you need to know about this garbage. Save your money people, this is a disgrace to film, art, and history."
1,Please...,"George, George, George... it's not happening my friend. I... we want the original 3, unaltered, cleaned up and on blue ray format. Over!"
1,Why not release the originals!!!,A review to bring attention to the fact that it appears Lucas does not care about what the fans want. Just say no to the Special Ed. Edition.
1,Here we go again...,"Here is George Luca$ trying to sell the public ( fans and no fans ) rotten fish...or worst, disguised rotten fish. I prefer to have the limited original trilogy even if non anamorphic ( mastered from Laserdisc ) with the special editions rather than only those new ones...something not ofered here. A little bit like the Lord of the Rings trilogy with only theatrical cuts. I WON'T upgrade my DVD and I'm not a fan! So give 1 star and Luca$ seeing no one is buying will have to think WE deserve the originals as they were and this time remastered + the special editions because WE made him one of the richest in the industry. And that crappy cover...put Darth Vader there, not that stupid brat Anakin from the Crappy Menace that made me hate him, and hire Drew Struzan or Tom Chantrell, not some stupid photoshop graduate wannabe like the one who made de DVD covers."
5,Ewoks shall rule the galaxy!,"This is the most comprehensive collection of star wars movies to date. I don't understand why people give this a one star review. So what if he made ewoks blink, or if he added a few CGI rocks to a scene, big deal. Is that really going to ruin these great movies? These movies look fantastic and they sound even better! The roar of the engines passing by is enough to shake my room. The packaging is tasteful too. This is a great release and people should not be turned off by these bad reviews. They are just being nit-picky and whiney."
1,Just another voice in the chorus,I wish we had Michelangelo here to paint superhero costumes on the Sistine Chapel. George Lucas is not fooling anyone.
5,Happy Customer,Here is a brilliant idea for all you haters who want the originals....PUT IN YOUR OLD VHS TAPE AND BE HAPPY!!!!! But but its not HD. Boo who. If you want HD get this set. If you want the originals you'll have to settle for crappy res. Its as simple as that
1,"""I've Got a Bad Feeling About This...""","Just adding another voice of protest over the further alterations to what was once the greatest movie trilogy of all time (or at least my favorite). It boggles my mind why George Lucas makes unnecessary, even damaging, changes, but ignores flaws in the films that really do need fixing. The added ""NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOs"" to the climactic scene of ROTJ are just laughable. LAUGHABLE!! As someone on the Internet said, ""Star Wars has had so many tweaks, it looks like Joan Rivers now."" Enough is enough. Voting with my wallet. NOT getting this release. Maybe I'll look for a used set someday, for the bonus features, but even that might be problematic: If no one buys this set in the first place, there won't BE any used ones for sale!"
1,No more Money from me Lucas.,"I have purchased the original Star Wars Trilogy on:VHS (twice)LD (twice)DVDI've been a defender of the Special editions, with only the fact that Greedo shoots first really bothering me. I have $75 in Amazon bucks all ready to spend on these when I saw the new Vader scene from ROTJ.The camels back has been broken.I'm doneI'll keep the DVD's and live with that cut... Wish I could go back in time and get my old LD's back. If only I'd known that those cuts would never be available again because of a petty a nasty director. My only hope is that when Lucas dies his estate will see the wisdom in releasing original cuts of these films in HD."
1,sigh..,"for one, the edits are horrible.. thanks for ruining one of the most powerful villains in cinematic history :(just give us the original versions, or the thx remastered versions of the series (the one released in 97 i think) in blu-ray.. and all this drama will go away and you can get back all those non-sales (like me) and cancelled pre-orders.."
1,boycott cosigned,"Sure, I'll support this boycott. George Lucas is the only weirdo in movie history who gets away with blocking release of his own film's original version. That's even nerdier than posting this review. Just release both versions, dumb-dumb!"
2,The Gnostic Lucas,"I am convinced that the George Lucas who created the original, unadulterated trilogy was a benevolent, imaginative visionary. With his dismal prequels and an uncanny talent to botch the original trilogy by ""enhancing"" it, I believe that, at some point, a malevolent demiurge usurped licht-Lucas' control of the Star Wars universe and now torments us with exasperating changes. The CGI additions are incongruous with the visual style of the rest of the films; the additional dialogue robs the original films of subtlety (are people so dense that they are incapable of sensing conflict in Darth Vader without him shouting ""NOOOOO!""?); ""Han shot first,"" &c., &c., &c. . . . the list of grievances is too long to share in a brief review. Alas, Mr. Lucas continually succumbs to the Dark Side."
5,Star Wars for True Fans,"I bought this set for my boyfriend's birthday this month, but it was really for me. I have all six movies on DVD, but the quality is even better on Blu-Ray. The original trilogy is as breathtaking as ever, and the new trilogy is just as disappointing (they should have just remade them with better actors... but I digress.) However, this set is completely worth buying. We watched the spoofs that are an extra feature, and they were absolutely hilarious. You also get to see parts of the movies you've never seen before, with all of the deleted and alternate endings and the documentaries. It does have a lot of the same stuff as other Star Wars sets, but you can complete your collection with the Blu-Ray set. I think if you're a Star Wars fan of any caliber you should get this, if not for all of the bonus features, then just to watch the movies another hundred times on a different system. Do it! You know you won't regret it."
1,Naked Cash Grab,"While I disagree with many of the frankly libelous comments directed towards George Lucas that have been posted the last few days, I nonetheless agree that he should release the remastered original trilogy without all the ""special edition"" cgi and audio tweaks. Let's face it, the 'state of the art' cgi used in the special editions is outdated and ugly and it detracts from the joys of the original movies. Lucas can continue making all the changes he wants, but he should also give the fans what they want."
1,Lucas has lost his mind!,I was really looking forward to the Blu-Ray release but now I have no intentions of buying it! Lucas has to keep screwing with it! THANKS GEORGE!!! IDIOT!!!
1,I don't understand...,"why George Lucas refuses to release the original theatrical versions of these movies. I won't even address all the complaints of those fans who worried about ""silly"" things like video quality and audio mixing. Everyone knows what needs to be done to make this right, everyone except George Lucas apparently.Do new HD Transfers.Fix the ""audio"" in dialog so that people don't sound absurdly stupid.Give us the CHOICE to see the original trilogy as seen in theaters or the edited to death Special Editions."
1,Leave it alone George,"Dear George,I understood your desire to 'fix' your movies in the re-release several years ago. That was fine. A background change here, some extra CGI there. No big deal. But this? Your 'fixing' has ruined what was already the perfect scene. A powerful scene that was once full of emotion, now feels cheap and awful. Why George, why?"
1,Pathetic,"Do Not Buy.George Lucas needs to realise that he doesn't know best.He needs to stop ruining our favourite franchises (Star Wars, Indiana Jones).He's pathetic."
1,"If it ain't broke, don't fix it","I'll keep it short. Just had to include my vote for how bad this movie has been ruined by George Lucas. Half of the changes from the original version just do not make sense. The changes do not necessarily blend in well either. Hopefully Lucas will someday release the original non-special edition version on Blu-ray someday. Until then, I'll be skipping on this set."
5,Can't Wait For September!!,"Sorry to everybody who isn't finding this to be the product they are looking for. All I can say is, don't buy it. Rating it down will **NOT** accomplish any of the following:1) Convince anybody to not sell the product2) Change people's mind about buying the product3) Convince Lucas to release the original product4) Fulfill your lifeThere are better ways of trying to convince Lucas to release something different, and this is not one of them.As for me, I'm excited for this product to be released and can't wait for it to reach my door-step. 2-day delivery? Yes, please! Get it here soon! And you are all invited for the Star Wars Marathon when it gets here."
1,Definitely dissapointing,"Come one... it's Star Wars. Why not just pony up for the best possible transfers?? And go ahead and throw in the original versions for kicks (they're probably better anyways, I just can't remember since I haven't seen them in so long). Also dissapointed to find out that they are leaving out tons of bonus materials. Do we REALLY have to wait another few years for a better ""Collector's Edition"" or something to come along. I'd rather pay more for a definative version right now than get this version and have to shell out again in a couple years to upgrade. What a bummer. George Lucas sucks.If you're with me create your own 1-star review. Lets try and bomb this product."
1,Doesn't play!!,"These discs wouldn't play and by the time I figured out there was no way to make them play (updating firmware, trying other players) it had passed the ""return window"" of 14 days (which I didn't know existed) so Amazon won't take them back. Complete waste of money."
1,I AM BOYCOTTING,"I REFUSE to buy this CRAP!!!!I will not buy this garbage! Adding Darth Vader screaming in the most pivotal scene of the entire franchise is the straw that broke the camels back!!!!This is ridiculous, and the only way George will fix this is IF WE DON'T BUY IT!!!!!I am as big a Star Wars fan as you will ever meet (I PROMISE YOU). THIS IS GARBAGE!!!!!!!"
1,"Decidely NOT ""The Complete Saga""","More ridiculous changes from George Lucas? Par for the course. I've never been outraged by them until now, though. George has all the resources in the world to give the fans what they want (and include his ever-changing vision of these films, as well), but instead he gives us only the latter. And now the original films contain spare parts from FIVE DECADES. Is this out of arrogance? Out of spite? Senility? Perhaps we'll never know.Like most fans, I was looking forward to watching these films in Hi-Def, Special Editions or not, but these films continue to sink to new lows. Don't reward anyone for it. These have ceased being films and are now amalgams of classic movie moments, bad (modern) special effects, and even worse story revisions. Stop it, George. Now."
1,Noooooooo!,"This addition to a classic is a complete failure. I do not understand why the Lucas camp thinks this was a great idea. It was a failure in III, and now in a classic. Ruined my childhood. Thanks Lucas, I was really looking forward to this coming out on Blu-Ray. ROTJ was one of my favorites growing up....and amazing scene....gone bad."
1,"Mr Lucas, you are dead to me!","This is quite sad. People have posted the appropriate comments and complaints, so I will not belabor the point. Suffice it to say that this is not worth your time or money. Gorge Lucas has murdered a classic and this release is now no par with the most recent Indiana Jones (another tragedy). Sir, I am done with you and your franchise I will no longer purchase Star Wars products because they are a pale representation of what once was... The sad thing is that I am only 25 and this is blatantly obvious to even me."
1,"I Wont Buy, until Lucas decides to make another Star Wars Trilogy or Film.","It's over due! Lucas should keep on making Star Wars Films like what they did on Harry Potter. If he is to Lazy to Direct & Write them, there are Lots & Lots of unemployed Talents out there who can do it for him. Funding the new Films wont be an issue, I bet you, All producers would want to bank on this Franchise, because it's an instant success.Star Wars Universe has so much potential for a New and Exciting Stories. Honestly, I'm TIRED of Anakin & Luke. I want to see the Next Generation Jedi's on the Big Screen. Solo & Leia's twin kids Jaina and Jacen would be Awesome. Or, a Han Solo & Wookie one shot Film. Anything as long as it's not about Vader, Anakin & Luke.So for now, I'd say, NO to this Blu-Ray Gimmick.Give us something new then we will give you our money(=Thanks!STRALLENT*COM"
1,Lucas is NOT getting my money this time...,"Between Darth Vader now screaming ""Noooooooooooo"" as he picks up and throws the emperor, much like the way he does at the end of Episode III and the fact that Han still does not shoot first... this is FUBARd but good. Lucas has now officially gotten me to the point where I will NOT buy his recycled crap anymore and when the 3D versions come out, I will not be in line waiting to see them. I still have my DVDs of the ORIGINAL trilogy, and that is what I will continue to watch when I want to see Star Wars."
1,MORE changes????,"It now seems that even MORE changes have been added...I could sort of take it before, but after seeing a preview, I just had to cancelmy pre-order, such a shame, I'll be sticking with my DVD copies, and ignoring this release untileither the original versions are released, or even the 1997 or 2004 editions (not likely)."
2,No way!,"Reluctantly I've cancelled my pre-order on this.Adding more unnecessary changes to the classic trilogy (""Nooo!"", Ben's scream, Sebulba at Jabbas palace, pointless zooms, etc.), but not taking any efforts to fix the things that would be worth fixing (messed up color-timing since 2004, inconsistent lightsaber colors, garbage mattes much too prominently visible since the messed up 2004 color-timing changes, ...) is as weak as Lucasfilm could get with this.All this stuff wouldn't matter if there were nice HD-transfers of the unchanged original trilogy, but instead of doing this, the trilogy just gets altered into an incredible joke that was once the greates sci-fi saga of all time.The extensive extras deserve two stars, but those alone aren't worth 90 bucks to me. It's sad to see what has become of Star Wars."
1,Can't really call these director's cuts.,"Lucas didn't direct the better episodes. Wonder how the directors feel about all the awful changes. I know his divorce totaled his assets, but does he really need to keep squeezing out pointless or damaging incremental changes in order to get people to buy yet another copy of a 30 year old film?"
1,Analog Sunset is a disgrace.,"WARNING. Downgrades video format to 480i when using Component Video output from Bluray player. This is a disgrace, I bought the bluray for 1080i - if I wanted 480i I'd have saved a lot of $$$ and bought the dvd version. Don't force me to use HDMI because the studios assume I'm a thief and want the digital handshake. I'm not buying a new projector - my Marantz is great.The manufacturers need to make this format downgrade a clear disclaimer when selling this set.I'm sending the set back to Amazon and 20th Century fox will not be getting another penny of my hard earned cash."
4,Exsqueeze me!,"""Ooh, mooey mooey! I love you!""""Monsters out there, leaking in here. Weesa all sinking and no power. Whena yousa thinking we are in trouble?""Laughing! These are just some of the delightful quotes fans of the Stars War movies have been treasuring for years. And now they're better than ever with state-of-the-art BluVision. Revisit your old pals...like Prince Lair, Hon Sola, Cherrberrkerr, Yado, and everyone's favorite, JerJer Bints. It's a space saga like no other, and it's finally coming to DVD! Order your copy and receive three extra discs of bonus content including: footage, scenes, audio, characters, art, music...and much more!As someone we know used to say ""Yoosa should follow me now, okeeday?"" You said it, JerJer!"
5,This is an excellent released that dwarfs everything released before.,This is an excellent release that dwarfs everything released before. The fanboys are in an uproar because The Creator (G.L.) made some much needed upgrades to the movies. Go figure.
1,Does George Lucas have a plate in his head?,"...No, he's got a whole set of china! He has butchered this set with a slew of disjointed, insipid CG effects. It's so bad, Triumph the insult comic dog wouldn't even poop on it."
1,not giving that lunatic any more of my money.,"Even though I would have preferred to get the earlier movies without modifications, I thought it would be good to see the movies in HD. I was going to buy them. Now that I heard that Lucas even modified the new movies, I realized that I am not going to give any more of my money to that lunatic."
1,"Theatrical Cuts, Where are You?","Where are the theatrical cuts, come on money grab. THis really is wrong on so many levels. Not only is this cheap set irritating , it is also expensive"
1,Screwed Again,"It's simple. No original versions of the first three films, NO SALE. And for those who actually think it doesn't matter, they obviously have no concept of film history. These remakes are NOT the movies we fell in love with all those years ago. The three original films deserve to be released in the new format. What is so hard about including both versions in the boxed sets??????"
4,Ok i understand.....,I understand that people are upset about these changes and i too think that they are completely unnecessary..... but that being said i think that people need to understand that these still are the movies we have loved since we were kids!! We still have the epic scenes from Empire when Luke meets his father for the first time and the epic fight scene that ensued... We still have the epic battles on endor and the death star...their are still the characters we have loved for so many years... These changes are things that are kids are going to grow up seeing no matter what... even if we don't buy these DVD's... This is now apart of the star wars saga weather we like it or not... These changes arent going to make me stop being a star wars and i hope that it isnt going to stop you...
3,Yeah so?,"So are people really supposed to get excited that a series that has been released countless times, on several formats, with numerous edits is finally being released on Blu-Ray? Blu-Ray has been around for how long? And on top of that, they're taking pre-orders six months in advance. Star wars is a good series but.....c'mon."
3,Frequent audio dropouts on disc 2,"I have just finished watching the first three movies in this set. The first and third seem fine, but the second one has frequent audio dropouts - sound just stops for a fraction of a second. It's really quite annoying. I hope Fox reissues this disc and makes a free replacement of it for us."
1,Doesn't even deserve 1 star.,"I just had the chance to view a borrowed copy before purchasing it...thank god!!! This is a bastardized version of a classic. It's on par with throwing some technocolor into classic black & white films. Although the video looks stunning, the new additions to the movies were sooo unnecessary, they stand out like a very very sore thumb. I wanted to see what all the hubbub was about and can't agree with the majority more. These ""subtle"" additions are crammed down your throat. Lucas has ruined a good thing and no doubt will continue tinkering with it until it's no longer recognizable."
1,Enough is enough...,"I'm not a snob about these films but there's a point where all the narcissistic tinkering ends up being disrespectful to the cast, crew, directors, writers, and countless people that actually worked on the films, as well as the fan base. With a wave of his digital wand, Lucas overwrites the hard work that many talented people put into these films and the creative decisions they made at the time. I plan to vote with my dollar and hold out for an unaltered original version."
4,Great Saga,"I watched all six movies with my son, and for the first time understood the full story line. The remaster was great , but the audio quality (loud special effects, quiet dialogue) was not great."
1,TOTAL RUBBISH,"I was a huge fan of the original trilogy but I doubt I will ever watch them again. The special editions were pointless, the new scenes and background interest looked out of place.The prequels were appalling, the less said about them the better.And now George has messed up the bluray release with pointless tinkering.He won't be getting any more money from me I won't be buying this set.If you want a vision of the future, imagine George Lucas stamping on the original cuts - forever!"
1,from $139.99 down to $89.99 ? NNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO,"George I must ask you what type of marihuana are you smoking to permit such atrocities to be implemented on these pieces of art ? I know you were already old and not thinking right when you made episode I , II and III but come on, now you have to mess up episode IV, V and VI too ? You should call this Star Wars : The complete failure edition Saga. Because of this , I will have no option but to give the prophecy that the world is going to end on Sept 16, 2011 . You will hear a big NNNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO !"
1,Lucas is a hypocrite!,How George Lucas could go from the champion of artistic integrity to an ego-centric revisionist tool simply boggles the mind!
1,Noooooooooooooooo,Me too have cancelled the pre-order for this version. Do hope Mr Lucas receive the message from the fans! So may years to release this?. Something seems to be wrong at Lucasfilms.
1,who cares?,"They didn't include the theatrical version of the film, it's just another in a long line of re-edits, even if you don't care about the theatrical version of the films you could wait a year for the even more special edition in 3D. So what is the point of this set? It's just a couple of truly worthless plastic discs."
1,No George. I want those OTHER films I grew up with!,"I had to add my voice to the chorus of those lamenting the fact that George Lucas feels the original, theatrical cuts should be forgotten and abandoned. If you're going to release the Star Wars saga on Blu-ray, including the so-called 'improved, definitive' versions, at least be reasonable to the fans who've supported you over the years by including restored, cleaned-up versions of the original trilogy--the films that I grew up with--those ones that haven't been tampered with on numerous occasions. This Blu-ray set is incomplete!"
1,ruined,"i refuse to be a part of these ""changed"" versions of star wars. if MR tough guy ever decides to give the fans what they really want, the original unchanged versions, i'll buy those. NEVER THIS, NEVER"
1,Where is the Blu-ray Original Theatrical Release?,"There is no good reason the original theatrical releases of each film aren't being included in this set. Just like Lord of the Rings on Blu-ray, I won't be purchasing this set until a complete version is released. I'm not going to reward Lucasfilm with my money for a sub-par product. I'm patient, but I'm upset the impatient, frivolous masses are delaying my enjoyment."
1,Revisions Are Tolerable,"What is inexcusable is Lucas's refusal to give the original, untainted trilogy a full restoration and hi-definition release. The sanctity of Star Wars has long been forfeit. All that's asked is that the integrity of the originals be preserved amid the abortive atrocities that Star Wars has come to represent."
1,Make Something New,"It's just ridiculous. How many times are you going to remake the same thing? At this point, there should be a dozen star war films out there that focus on other stories. But NOOOOOO, we're subjected to seeing the same stories over and over again. Enough is enough. The first time the original trilogy was released was good... i can understand revamping them a bit, but this is stupid. The second trilogy was bad all on its own... horrible acting and horrible directing... but whatever, I'll swallow it.... but at this point, the Star Wars universe has so much more to tell on the big screen that's just dumb to recreate the same thing over and over.OVERKILL ANYONE???Buy this if you want to feed the corporate work dog which is Lucas Art.Don't BUY IT and petition against this lack of creativity.Regardless, I love star wars, but don't take advantage of my LOVE. -___-"
1,Mehhhhhhhhh...,"This is a perfect example of how to take a beautiful thing and debase it out of spite. Vader says ""Noooooooo..."" at the end of Return of the Jedi? I say ""Mehhhhhhhhh...."" to this. I cancelled my preorder."
5,I really see no problem...,"I grew up with the original trilogy, watching it get tampered with during each edition that came out. Regardless, I still really enjoy the series. It looks beautiful on the TV, and the extra content it comes with makes the set completely worth it in my opinion. I can understand if someone is looking at this from a 'purist' standpoint and gives it the no go, but even for all the crazy additions contained within the actual movies, I'm still a kid at heart, and still love the series for what it is: A GREAT escape from reality for a few hours.Give it a shot. I really don't think you'll be disappointed at all."
1,not his,"Lucas really needs to realize that the movies belong to the fans, and not to him. He may be the creator, but he owns them just as much as Da Vinci owns the Mona Lisa. What he is doing is akin to someone magic markering eyebrows onto ol' Mona.I for one will not be buying this, maybe renting if cheap.That being said, growing up I watched the originals at least once a month. Loved just sitting back and enjoying them, even RotJ. Watched them countless times and never got bored; enjoyed each viewing like it was the first. With that in mind, I have sat all the way through the Phantom Menace once, Attack twice, and Revenge once, and that is enough for me. In fact, since the prequels came out, I have only watched the originals a couple of times. Lucas has lost whatever magic he once had. It is time to let go of the reins and let someone else take over. (though he has said on numerous occasions, he will not)."
1,Not gonna do it,"Lucas' youngest daughter recently posted a reply on Twitter to comment on how funny it was that the people complaining about the new alterations (i.e. the haters) would rush out to buy this set regardless. Well, not this ""hater"". I didn't grow up with the theatrical versions and seeing the special editions on the big screen in 1997 was my first exposure to the series. That said, these films are significant in film history and continuing to change audio and video (arguably for the worst) while completely ignoring the versions that made this series such an important part of our shared culture is just a big slap in our collective faces. I'm done. At least filmmakers like Ridley Scott and Steven Spielberg give us the option of viewing the version we prefer in high definition. Nooooooooo more Mr. Lucas. A big no to Star Wars 4.0."
1,Do Not Want,do not wanttainted. damaged goods. dead on arrival. you're not listening george. han shot first. vader doesnt scream like a little girl and neither does obi-wan.dig love peace.
1,I know it's been said already,"Lucas continues to ruin the Star Wars original movies. He's making Return of the Jedi worse. I didn't think that could happen.Buy yourself the DVD's that included the laserdisc transfers of the original versions. You'll be happier. Even the 2004 DVD's are relatively acceptable. But these new changes they have made... well, it's just gone too far.Don't buy this. Speak with your wallet. It would be like colorizing Casablanca and only releasing that version from now on. Make Lucas restore his classic, award winning films the way they should be.I repeat, do not buy this. Borrow it from a friend. I have a friend named TPB and his friend Demon... something. I know they'll let me borrow it."
1,Add one more to the list....,"I don't consider myself the biggest fan of Star Wars ever, but I do enjoy watching the movies and going to that galaxy far, far away. I didn't have a problem with most of the se changes (though putting the younger version of Anakin at the end of rotj was bad), and I am certainly no Star Wars purist (don't care who shot first), but messing with the most climactic and dramatic scene of the series is absolutely and unconditionally a deal breaker. I canceled my pre-order immediately after seeing the new version of the scene, and I will not bother to buy the series on blu ray unless this travesty is rectified. Update the graphics, add deleted scenes, fix mistakes...but don't mess with the moments that make the series."
3,Star Wars BluRay Collection Sound Problems,I purchased this DVD collection and played Episode 1. The default sound type is set for 6.1 sound. I do not have 6.1 sound and the sound was silent so I selected 5.1 sound but it is only available in English with commentary. The commentary is for site challenged persons. I am hearing challenged so I also like to have closed captions turned on. I spent an hour trying to get the commentary eliminated with no luck. Why would Lucas make the DVD with no 5.1 un-commented version of sound on the disk given it is probably the most prevalent sound system. So please don't tell me to throw my 4 year old $1000 Audio equipment away and buy a new system. Also apparently my audio equipment is not firmware upgradable to include more decoders. I am very frustrated. I will not buy more BluRay disks again because of the probability of having more audio problems.BluRay is apparently not ready for prime time.Buyer Beware.
1,Originals...please?,"Just adding my voice to the chorus of people clamoring for the release of the original trilogy in its original version. With the exception of the prequel trilogy in theaters, I haven't watched a Star Wars movie in over a decade because I find some of the additions and changes very off-putting. I'm not making that up. I tried a couple of years ago with some very old VHS versions I've hung on to, but the tapes have not aged well (they're probably 20 years old at this point). Is it really so much to ask to get the originals?"
1,"The Real Story Behind ""The Star Wars""","The real George Lucas died many years ago in a galaxy not so far away. He was then replaced by a clone George Lucas. Sometime in the early to mid 1990's, the clone Lucas received a holographic message from Palpatine. ""It is time Mr. Lucas,"" Palpatine said, ""execute order 66."" The clone then looked into the hologram and said ""It will be done my lord."" And starting in 1997 we received the special edition vhs tapes, followed by three prequels.....then 2004 special edition dvds and now.............the complete saga. The circle is now complete, STAR WARS IS DEAD."
1,Another disillusioned Star Wars fan,"I grew up loving Star Wars and I still adore it. I have been looking forward to owning the Star Wars Blu-ray set when it comes out. The news in the New York Times and the clips on Youtube of Darth Vader have completely confounded any desire that I once had to own this series on Blu-ray.I won't buy it, Mr. Lucas. I'm sorry, but you're destroying this artwork by doctoring your film over and over. I know it's ""just sci-fi"" and you ""own"" it, but what you're doing with these idiotic and dispeptic edits is as essentially artistically unethical as putting a frowny face on the Mona Lisa. You should be ashamed."
1,Does a 3 second change really matter?,"Well let's put this in the correct perspective...Citizen KaneWhat if the dying declaration was changed from ""Rosebud"" to ""Booty""...Nuff Said"
1,NOOOOOooooooOOOooo to my order as I use the force to cancel,"Once again Darth Lucas is changing his movies to ""improve"" them. Well Vader screaming NOOOOOO is just terrible and what is even worst is Obiwan's Krayt Dragon cry to scare off the Sand People sounds like a sound bit from Family Guy! Do yourselves a favor and cancel. Don't fall to the darkside."
1,"Yeah, no.","All I can say is ""no."" Lucasfilm should never have added Christensen to the 2004 DVD release of Jedi, but it looks like the changes to this Blu-Ray set will be far worse than that. Please don't buy this."
1,WHAT A JOKE!!!,4k transfers instead of 8k???? and no original versions??? 5.1 sound and not 7.1 from Mr. THX himself??? enough said...I'm not buying this crap...
1,"Just can't do it. Waiting for the ""Original Edition""","The Blu-Ray capacity should be the platform to release ALL Flavors of these movies.I would rather watch the ""Laser Disc"" versions of the 'originals'.Han Shot First !!!"
1,Oh no!.....why tinker with a great movie?,"I guess I will skip buying the new blu rays of Star Wars. With all the negative reviews, I can tell that it is not what I want to spend my money on. I read an article yesterday with Steven Spielberg that said he regrets changing E.T. and will correct the errors in blu ray. Thank goodness, because I noticed right away they had removed all the guns. Mr. Lucas needs to take a copy out of SS's playbook."
1,don't feed the greed,I am going to wait for the original versions to be remastered for BD. We all know Lucas is trying to sell these movies as many times as possible so send a message and skip this version. You have probably already owned these on VHS and DVD but trying to sell us multiple BD versions is ridiculous and should not be rewarded with repeat purchases of the same format.
1,Nooooooooooo,"It's not just what Vader says in the newly-destroyed final confrontation at the end of 'Jedi', it's the reactions of millions of fans."
1,no originals=inferior product,"There is no excuse for the original versions to be missing from a ""complete"" set. A very, very poor value compared to the discs for Alien, Aliens, Close Encounters, Blade Runner or Apocalypse Now. (to say nothing of the hundreds of blu-rays of films from the '70s and 80s, from Roger Corman schlock to Raging Bull and everything in between. Releases that somehow managed to make the effort to create brand new HD discs from the best elements available. An effort that is apparently too much to ask of this billion-dollar series. (And yet not too much for TANGO AND CASH.) Order canceled."
1,........laughable.,"At this point why even post?However, this is the exact reason the whole STAR WARS name has become a joke. Wow, did I love this series...."
1,More bad choices in a long history of bad choices.,There is a saying about artists.The master knows when to stop while others do not.Please do not give this man more money.
1,"Yes, it's not out yet, but...","I realize the BD isn't out yet, but it's obvious that Lucas has contempt for the fans of the series that made him a billionaire. I've cancelled my pre-order. He simply won't give the people what they want, and that is the original 3 movies without his nearly 2 decades of digital tinkering. It's very simple, but the company that owns this perhaps does not care. Since they don't care, now neither do I. So I cancelled."
1,George Lucas has killed my childhood... Again.,"Why oh why George, do you feel the need to destroy the childhood memories of millions of 35-45 year old men all over the world? First you emasculated Han by making Greedo shoot first, then you ruined Indiana by nuking the fridge, and you've delivered the lowest blow yet by changing Vader from the biggest bad a$$ to the biggest wussy not once but twice! Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!"
1,Won't get fooled again,"As someone old enough to actually remember being awestruck at seeing the original Star Wars (Episode IV now) at the movie theater in 1977, I don't think it's a minor quibble to hate the remakes. How many editions has Lucas put out now of the original trilogy, about 6? I won't buy this series on blu-ray until the original, ""Han shot Greedo first"" and ""No CG Skinny Jabba"" for Han to step on version is available. While not a big fan of episodes 1-3, for the sake of completeness I would buy this version if released. This may never happen, but that just means I'll never see it on blu-ray."
1,Why?,Why is George Lucas giving us another intermediate version of the same product and why is people allowing him to do so?Get the famous ultimate version SW Fans worldwine deserve finally out and stop this lame attempts of double dipping that are only sinking our beloved saga more and more.
4,Didn't think it was such a bad set.,"The only thing I would knock it for was not having the original theatrical versions of the original trilogy. Other than that, everything else is on point."
1,Noooooooooooo!,"Noooooooooooo! I will not be buying this. I've spent thousands of dollars supporting Star Wars and Lucasfilm with my collecting of almost anything Star Wars, and I really looked forward to buying the Blueray. But enough is enough. Noooooooooo is the last straw. Way to alienate your fans, George."
1,Ugh...,"Stop, just stop. Its stupid, all of it. Star Wars is Star Wars, not A New Hope. Han shoots first. Hayden Christensen was 2 when Jedi came out. Darth Vader isn't a baby. George Lucas get a hobby that doesn't involve making things worse."
1,Poor Quality,"This set is just bad. A friend has an early copy and I wasn't impressed, and this is coming from a fan. on Sept. 16th, I suggest you pass up this set and avoid frustration, disappointment and most importantly of all Darth ""NO!"""
1,"Too much change, too bad.","With all the changes I had read about, the addition of Darth Vader's ""Nooooo"" lines is the straw that broke the camels back. Order cancelled."
1,No please.,"What is it with Lucas making Vader yell ""Nooo!"" I laughed so hard in revenge of the Sith when he did it. Which makes me mad because I was really liking that movie up to that point. It sounds so very awkward and silly.Adding a ""Nooo!"" to Return of the Jedi is stupid too. It's a comical voice and so very (VERY) out of character for Darth. Seriously, when things get really bad he yells ""no"" like a whiny school girl? Come on. Dumb, dumb, dumb. Just makes me sad that scenes that could've been (and in this case were) serious and emotional are now a big joke.Maybe you disagree...but can we surely all agree that Lucas should NOT be messing with arguably the most pinnacle scene in the series? Or maybe he's just doing it to get people talking. I guess that worked, but people are also not buying...not me at least."
1,NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Ewoks Blinking, New ""NOOOOOOOOO"" inserted at the end of Jedi, Boba's Australian voice, completely changed Ewok song and countless other completely unnecessary alterations to classic films makes this an easy choice to not spend your money on. The original versions are not included in this set. Don't settle and be a fool."
1,"Noooo, thank you.","I'm one of the only people I know who doesn't own any version of the original trilogy whatsoever.That's because as free market consumers, we vote with our dollars to let people know what's ok and what's not ok.This boxset is not ok.Don't buy it.Don't buy ANY Star Wars releases until Lucas offers the original piece of motion picture history in it's unedited anamorphic glory as the MAIN attraction and not some bonus material.Does he seriously not have any idea how much money he'd actually make if he did that? For someone apparently so business-savvy, he's an idiot at paying attention to his target demographic."
1,TO EXPENSIVE FOR 8K TRANSFER!?!?!?!?!?!?!?,"With the obscene amount of money this franchise has made, it a downright crime that they could not pony up the dough and do it right. I am a die hard, true blue Star Wars fan and have purchased a copy in almost every format made but I wont buy this version."
5,Amazing!,I bought this for my husband and he loved it! The quality of the sound and picture is beautiful. I highly recommend it.
2,Laughing about it!,"Star Wars was the first movie I ever saw in the theater, mind you I am only 21 so it was the re-release version and it was great. I absolutely love the original trilogy, and I love the other three as well but in a laughable kind of way. I have not purchased this blue-ray set do to the good reviews so many have posted. It's upsetting to take the laughable sensation of the prequels and add it to the amazing films that we all really enjoy. When I saw episode 3 I witnessed people crying at the end when Anakin becomes Darth Vader and Padme dies...As I'm laughing my a** off because of ""NOOOOOOOOOOO!"" And if they truly added that to RotJ...this series has fallen to the DARKSIDE!"
1,What a joke,"I was going to pre-order this but after hearing about the non-stop tinkering with the originals, I give up. I don't think I can say anymore than what has been already said here. I watched the clip where Vader say ""Nooooooooo"", scene destroyed...What an absolute shame!"
1,Theatrical Releases please,"Y U NO UNDERSTAND? Gerogie boy, people do not want your terrible additions to the original series. People shouldn't expect to ever the theatrical releases for sale on any format, and that is truly sad."
1,Star Wars Travesty,"I will not be buying Star Wars again until I can have the versions I enjoyed in my youth. These movies are barely recognizable anymore. The epic originals have been tainted by the CG stupidity and revisionism of the idiotic prequels. This kind of malicious tinkering would be bad enough with ANY movie, but to trash the most important movies of my LIFE? UN-believable. Shame on Lucas."
1,More bastardizing of the original great.,"I think we're just watching Lucas masturbate at this point.He's simply acting, on his own, to re capture a lost glory, and slightly modifying details a bit to continue to keep him self excited about the act. Sorry George, I've grown up.All I've wanted from you all these years, is a continuation of the story. You tried, with Ep 1,2 and 3... Delivering the most absurdly written and poorly orchestrated examples of film making this side of how they script COPS (yes, the reality TV show).And then after that, you're just re-editing, and re-editing, and trying to capture something that wasn't perfect to begin with, which means you'll never obtain perfection with it.Move on. Do something new.For all our good."
2,"Can't do it, cancelled. And it doesn't even have to be the originals...","Just can't do it, had to cancel my pre-order. I would love the originals, but even good special editions would suffice. But this next round of changes is just too much. Of all things, there are two more ""Nooooo""'s added in? Ugh.I'll just stick with Adywon's Star Wars Revisited DL-DVD and Netflix these Blu-rays this round..."
1,I done with star wars,..until I can have the original theatrical releases. I cant stand Boba fett's new voice. its too much. Just remaster the originals please. no alterations.
1,Just Say Noooooooo!,"Vote with your wallet and buy the original theatrical version on DVD. Yes, they look bad. Yes, they don't fill up a pristine high-def television. Yes, they're expensive for the relatively low-quality you'll get. But they're the real versions, not these crude chop jobs. Just say nooooooo to fake Star Wars."
2,Disgrace to cinematic integrity,"Why would Lucas choose to once again screw with a perfect product, while many will call those of us delusional and childish about such minor changes in the classic films. The point is that they were classic films and that in making these changes and adding scenes and dialogue that weren't in them previously just because he can seems like he doesn't care what we the fans and consumers want, if these films came out today with Lucas at the helm and with today's technology these films would be panned by critics and snubbed by movie goers because the films would rely heavily on CGI and poor dialogue without a coherent story. This is verified by the prequels and the only reason that they were successful was because of the fan base of the original; which Lucas continues to destroy with his ineptitude."
1,Do NOT give in to the dark side! Don't buy this!,"The NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO in Return of the Jedi is the last straw. As someone who had contributed to making George Lucas rich in the first place, I will not give him any more of my money. Google ""Star Wars Rebellion Collection,"" save your money, hit Lucas in his pocketbooks and stand for artistic integrity."
2,Failed Dip,"Sadly as much as it is nice to have the films in HD, the new movies do NOT hold up (obviously as films, but also many of the VFX throughout the films sometimes look TERRIBLE, just my op)Either way, I will NOT support Lucas until the day he releases the UNTOUCHED un EDITED original cuts of the original films."
1,No digital copies+no theatrical releases = no value add,"Disappointing and kind of sad really. You'd think Lucas would figure out that folks will stop buying his movies if there isn't a compelling reason to buy them. With the digital upscaling on most players these days there is no reason to buy this set vs. one of the older sets. If you must see the deleted scenes (which face it you'll watch once), just rent it. Plus if you find the constant ""tweaks"" annoying (I actually don't care anymore), then the vader ""noooooooooooooo"" may make you go postal."
3,Dammit Lucas...,"Alright, so here it is. All the bad, right now:Deleted scenes DO NOT include ALL deleted scenes. Most notably, Shaak-Ti's death is not included.Changes to some movies are terrible and should not have been included.Theatrical versions are not included.Some of the effects got much worse. Most notably, Ki-Adi-Mundi (Pointed headed jedi) looks absolutely appalling in episode one.Most deleted scenes are very difficult to watch as they are very, very early removals. Almost all nearly-complete deleted scenes (from 1-3, at least) are not included.Difficult to navigate bonus disks.Difficult to remove disks from case.Does not include a description of bonus disks except on throw-away.Alright, now all the good:Menu is very clean.1-3 look spectacular; definite improvements.Extra content is really cool.Case is really nice; seems durable."
2,Just wait! 3D maybe out in 6-12 months..,Just wait a few months.. It will come out in 3D.... People will get angry again! I'm gonna wait for the Complete Star Wars Saga to come out in 3D..
2,"""Complete"" according to Lucas","While I rejoiced when the Star Wars: The Complete Saga was announced for Blu-ray, I have held off on placing a pre-order. While George Lucas has every right to change the Star Wars movies before the Blu-ray release, I guess that means ""complete"" applies to himself on how he views the Star Wars movies. When I see ""complete"" for a movie release, I would assume that a theatrical release of the Star Wars movies would be included and not any additional tweaks that Lucas has done since then.Are any of the tweaks, like replacing the Muppet of Yoda with a CGI version, needed to make Yoda look credible for this HD release? If Lucas wants to tweak the Star Wars movies, because he feels something could be improved, then I would prefer that the original and tweaked versions are included."
5,A long time ago in a galaxy name AMAZON...far away!!!,"Hello there. First at all, thanks so much for shipping this blu-ray set collection. I'm just receiving it and the only thing I could say that would be...""may the force be with you guys""...I appreciate it thanks!!"
1,No,Just no. Did anything need to be changed? No. Does this add in any way to the story? No. Has George Lucas done anything right with the Star Wars franchise since Return of the Jedi? No. Just no...
1,Theatrical releases of Episodes 4 - 6 please.,"I was getting ready to buy this. Great to have the whole series on Blu-ray. I'm not a fan of the prequels, but I thought my boys would like them. But I'm only interested in the original, theatrical versions of episodes 4-6. Without those, I won't buy. I'll just stick with my 'old-school' DVDs, thank you very much."
1,Waiting,I'll wait for the original version to come out on Blu-ray if they ever do. Changes aren't too bad but I prefer the original ones. You ain't getting my money that easily Lucas
1,Stay away from this release,"Unfortunately, Lucas keeps changing the movies because he sees them as unfinished. Well, what we fell in love with was what we saw, whether it was finished or not. He seems to be changing it for himself, because the majority of fans just want the theatrical release in Blu-Ray I would argue. The more he changes it so he likes it, the less we do.Lucas did better when he had less technology, he did what he could and focused on the quality of the story. Now with technology easily wielded, he is doing unthinkable things to the franchise. The same thought process that came up with Jar Jar Binks."
1,STAR WARS APOLOGIES,"I purchased the 2004 box set on DVD along with each ""prequel"" film as they were released. Then I purchased the same Original Trilogy again on DVD just to get the REAL Trilogy. No one made me buy these films, I wanted to for fun and posterity sake.But George Lucas' attitude concerning his failure to treat the original trilogy with the respect it deserves by listening to the fans (the people who made him rich), has finally made me understand one thing: GEORGE DOESN'T CARE WHAT WE THINK. So in that tradition I don't care about these new Blu-ray releases. Seriously, I'm not that desperate.You owe the fans an apology....and not in the form of a shoddy half-baked Blu-ray someday. A REAL Blu-ray release of the original trilogy complete with a remastered anamorphic widescreen image and sound.I'm done with you George. Pick somebody else's pocket for a change."
2,Star wars blu ray 1.0,With star wars returning to theaters yet again in 2012 this time in 3D i expect they'll quickly return to bd in 3D next time and with extended editions and new transfers. If these movies had better transfers and were extended editions i'd be so there. At least dts is finally being used but we all realize a cash grab when we see it and this will be followed up with a better set after the new theatrical run.
1,George Lucas should be ashamed.,"In what other field of art can an artist walk into the museum years after finshing the painting or sculpture and just start hacking holes into the work and denying the public the right to see it as it orginally was. Lucas is wrong the movies are not ""his"" they belong to all of us now."
1,George Lucas' Ultimate Revenge On The Fans,"For all the annoying comments, for all the constant unsolicited input, for everything in general, George Lucas just got the final laugh.The thing is fans didn't want this set; they wanted something else. But this is what he put out. And in an ultimate ironic twist, George Lucas will sell you now that which you don't want (the butchered original trilogy plus the other three crappy prequels) But hey, they're all on HD!Will we resist? Or will we flock to the stores and to the online retailers, and buy it grudgingly, but buy it nevertheless?Who won this battle of the wills?NOOOOOOOO!!!!!(Yes.)"
2,"Great movies, Lucas forces changes","George Lucas has legal right to change his films after he makes them, but altering the original work we all fell in love with is lame. Especially when multiple versions are available on the majority of Blu-Ray discs out these days. Why not include the cleaned up ORIGINAL version as well as his new corny additions? sounds simple to me.The people have spoken, and Lucas' failure to address this major issue not only tarnishes his already flimsy reputation, but reassures me that he simply doesn't care. All more the negative.I'll wait a year before biting the bullet, but I hope I won't have to eat my words.NY, NY"
1,All I want is a Blu-ray transfer of the original. This is horrible.,"Seriously. I hated the 1994 changes. I hated the changes in the next version. The changes in this latest version are just unforgivable. Has Lucas gone senile?Stop tinkering with a film that has great historical significance! Please give us a straight up exact copy of the Academy Award winning original theatrical release in high-def on Blu-ray. I honestly don't care if it includes zero additional content. I just want a high-def transfer of the unaltered original film and I guarantee I'll buy it when you make it.Until we get a high-def transfer of the original, I refuse to buy another Star Wars product, be it book, movie, or whatever. I'm just sick to death of all the strange CGI additions, crazy added puppets, and horrible soundtrack hacks. Stop messing with perfection and give us what we want."
1,Like everybody else I cancelled my order,I love Star Wars but enough is enough. Please start listening to us George. After all we are the reason you are so rich. You would think that counted for something.
1,When will he learn?,"Episodes I-III brought me very little entertainment, and the main stars of the show (A New Hope, Empire Strikes Back, Return of the Jedi) all have been edited to something that I don't want."
1,the final straw,"i was eagerly anticipating buying this set, but NOOOOOOOOO longer. i can roll with the punches when it comes to SW, most of the changes that lucas has made over the years have been pointless, stupid, and distracting, but they are mostly fleeting moments i can overlook. but to take one of the most important scenes of the entire series, the scene where vader finally turns away from the dark side to save his son and redeem himself, and to ruin it with the single worst line reading in the entire series, that is where i draw the line. lucas can keep his precious SW series to tinker with and change as he sees fit; i'll keep my money in my wallet from now on."
1,Han shot first!,"Enough said. Update special effects if you want, but don't put things walking in front of the characters as they walk around town or change how scenes unfolded.Yes, this is Lucas's to do with as he pleases, but it has also become ours. Why no keep our vision in these discs and also put in the George's blurry visioned stuff too, then we can pic and choose. Really, how much would it cost to add the originals all cleaned up to this release?"
1,No Chance,"Seriously? ""Noooooo!""?When I was a kid, even up until a few years ago, getting me anything Star Wars related would have brought me a little bit of joy. I think I'm done with this franchise."
1,Disappointed Star Wars Fan,"After viewing the changes on the blu-ray set on movies.com, youtube.com, etc. I had decided to cancel the upcoming blu-ray set of the Star Wars Saga. It is disappointing to see the continued tinkering of this one-time masterpiece by the creator himself. It is truly insulting to the dedicated fans of the original films to receive another revised edition of this set, and not be given the original copy of the trilogy to satisfy the hardcore fans of the unaltered editions. It was not hard to cancel my pre-order. The blu-ray set is just another edition to make more money out of the desperate fans who want to see it on high-definition. Thanks George for making it easy to cancel my order and save money LOL"
1,NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!,"i can't believe this is literally happening. We all know about this NOOOO addition to return of the jedi at this point right? Come on, dude."
1,"Just say ""No. Noooooo!""","to George Lucas on his Bluray.Please, it was bad enough that Darth Vader said this in Revenge of the Sith. Adding this to Return of the Jedi, is just adding insult to injury."
1,check every disc before you keep your copy,"The problem with this series isn't the film making, it's the absolutely terrible quality of the blu rays themselves. I had to have my copy replaced twice before i got a copy that functioned. As for adding the whole vader screaming ""nooooo"" at the end of jedi, it's just like all the other stupid gimmicks lucas added to the ""special"" editions; pointless, and stupid. The movies are still good, but just be prepared to return several copies in order to get one that works. When i say mine didn't function, there were actual holes in the blu rays. I would recommend holding up your copy with the clear side facing you to a source of light, and check to make sure there aren't any holes. Do it for every disc, in the two bad copies i received the discs with holes varied."
1,WHAT A HORRIBLE COVER!,"Where is Drew Struzan. The concept is beautiful but the art is very bad for any SW fanatic used to the wonderful art of Drew Struzan. Sorry, I was waiting for a better cover on a major release. Simply is not worthy. OH maybe he is designing the cover for Star Wars Blue Ray Special Edition or Limited Edition or Directors Cut. Thank You Lucas!!!!"
1,"If it ain't broke don't fix -- oh, wait. Its officially BROKE. =/","I've had this on pre-order since it was released, I JUST NOW canceled it (9/2). The added ""Noooooo"" line was the final straw that broke the Tautaun's back. These movies (the OT) were fine as-is. Quit #$%@ing w/ them, George!!!!"
1,Another disaster by G. Lucas,"More stupid changes, and no theatrical version : Lucas is going insane with the original trilogy.He is ignoring fans requests, providing only his untalented vision.The more you link the original trilogy to the disastrous prequels, the more you frustrate your fans."
1,WHHHYYYYYY????????,"Quite simply comparing to the previous release, out of the five major changes, 4 are really dumb, and one is meh. Really really dumb!"
1,Want the Original Versions,I cancelled my order after reading other reviews that this set does not include the original versions. What Lucas and crew have done by CGIing these movies is no different than studios wrongfully colorizing old B/W movies. Why stop at CGI? Perhaps John Williams' beautiful scores should be replaced with an updated electronic synthesized version as well. You blew it George!
1,change of mind,Longtime Star Wars fan. Saw the first one in 1977 at 4 years old. I have loved Star Wars to a fault ever since. I was looking forward to buying this set. But with the news of the changes I have had enough. This is gone too far.
1,He's just mocking us now,"It's like Lucas slapped that annoying little kid on the cover just to mock us.Stop it George, just stop.Also it appears these will again look like crap, just like the 2004 DVDs. With the exception of Episode I, we're essentially getting a standard version of each film tossed onto a blue-ray.Please vote with your wallets and tell Lucas stop."
1,Please do not support this release.,"Not only are the original versions not included (as expected), but more changes have been made, further altering even the special editions. Please send Lucasfilm a message that there is an audience for the original versions and that no changes are necessary. Vote with your pocketbook. These are not the Star Wars movies you remember."
1,we don't need changes to a classic.,All I wanted was to see the best quality picture and sound for these movies. But what we will get is changes to the original and subpar Blu-ray disc quality. I want to watch this movie with my son and daughter as it was when I was 7 years old. I guess I'll have to wait until they release another version which contains the original theatrical versions. What a disappointment.
1,Can't wait,"I can't wait until Lucas releases new versions with all of his horribly awkward dialogue taken out. The real question about this release, though, is why Lucas is even bothering to do it at this late date. Doesn't he think the world is going to end next year?"
1,"I love Star Wars, which is why I've canceled my Preorder","From seeing it in the theatres in 1979 (rerelease) as a 6 year-old to... this? This is how Lucas repays the money I've poured into this franchise for decades? How can he not see he's insulting the fans? Do moviemakers make movies for the fans, or do fans pay moviemaker to make the movie he/she wants to see? If only George Lucas wants to see this version, why does he want us to pay for it.It's gotten ridiculous. In some ways, it's painful; to watch one of your best childhood memories slowly, but horribly destroyed over the course of 30 years. :("
1,Please don't support George Lucas,Please DO NOT buy this. George Lucas continues to ruin these movies and destroy what started out as a masterpiece. If you buy this you will only be supporting his madness. If you already have them on DVD then don't waste your money.
1,They pulled another 'Lucas',they found a new way to disappoint with Star Wars... well I guess we all saw that one coming right?
1,WAIT!!!dont buy this subpar excuse for a complete saga!,"Just anothe ploy by lucas to juice us of more money...you have so gone to the dark side now,is there any good left in you? No original trilogy, as well as4:3 apsect ratio?? Wtf! Where are the originals damn you!! i hate u soooooooooo much george....."
1,Wow...really? Again?,"Can we just get the original theatrical versions on BluRay? Is it that difficult, are we asking too much? Please."
1,EPIC FAIL! NNNooooooooooooooooooooo!!!!!!!!!!!!,"There have already been some excelent reviews written in the 1 Star section that I have neither the energy or motivation to emulate. Compare the 1 Star reviews to those who gave it 5 Stars (""Star Wars is Cool!"") and you will see who the real fans are.Lucasfilm has once again slapped the fans in the face. The changed Krayt dragon call, the pink Lightsaber and worse of all the Darth Vader screaming Noooooooo!!!!!!!!!!! is pathetic. Oh, by the way... it seems that the HUGE outcry from Fans for the past 15 years over the Greedo / Han incident meant nothing to Lucas. Yes, Greedo STILL Shoots first!So George, keep your Cash Cow to yourself. I Cancelled my pre-order."
1,The War Is Lost,"It's cinematic gentrification. Erasing history. 'Nuff said.Cleaning up the edges is one thing but adding or removing anything makes it a whole new movie.There are plenty of directors and producers who have always said that as soon as a movie is made and released, it is no longer theirs but the audiences. These were OUR movies not his to do with as he pleased."
1,Nooooooooooooo,It may sound like hyperbole but this release is a slap to the face for fans. If it had been nothing more than a prettier version of the DVDs we would have been happy and ponied up the money. But actually making them worse is unacceptable.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS JUNK!,"As a die-hard Star Wars fan I say ENOUGH! Do NOT buy this crap! If he had included the original unaltered versions with this set, I would have bought not one but two copies of this but unfortunately we are not allowed that choice by Mr. Lucas.So speak with your wallets and PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS! Maybe Mr. Lucas will finally wake up and give us fans what we've been asking for all these years!"
1,Not Hard at all..,"G.L, this is not hard at all, take the ORIGINAL films, have them remastered, and release them. IT'S VERY SIMPLE... if you do that, I will forgive you for 1, 2 and 3..."
1,Pathetic,"With the new changes confirmed by New York Times this morning I will not be purchasing this garbage. Adding a unintentionally hilarious new Krayt Dragon call, as well as NOOOOOOO! when Vader throws the Emperor to his death(ruining the emotional silence of Vader in the original cut) was the final insult that broke the dam. Also it appears that the ""fixes to the lightsaber colors"" is still not fixed like Lucasfilm was claiming. Thanks for saving me $90 Lucas you bloated hack."
1,Terrible decisions,"I have been an avid star wars fan my entire life, i have bought every vhs and dvd set until now. With as much space as we have on a blu ray disc, for George Lucas not to include all versions in hi def is just stupid. I am finally sick of the bull crap that we have all done through. He use to be one of my favorite people in film history, now he has become infamous. I will not buy a blu ray set until it contains all versions of the movie in 1 set."
4,review,"I came to the site, I saw a product, I decided I wanted the product, I authorized money to be exchanged and I received product. Everybody happy."
3,"it's OK, but not worth replacing the DVD's","I got this set to replace my DVD's, i read how it was all so much better and with the HD audio. When I got the set, I was dissapointed in eppisodes I-III, they didnt look that nice, and the audio was no improvement just about the only improvement was less pixelization in action scenes. episodes IV through VI were better, which justified the purchase for me. the extra features were fun too."
1,George Lucas is an a-hole.,It baffles me how he doesn't care about his fan base. Nobody should purchase these blu-rays. Anybody who does is just encouraging him to to take a flaming dump on these movies. Stop eating George Lucas' doo-doo butter.
1,Sad...sad...sad... :(,GARBAGE! EFF you Lucas! I wish there were NEGATIVE stars... I cannot believe he has managed to finally completely ruin this once-great series.
1,Lucas you make me Love Star trek!,When will it end? when will Georgey boy realize we DO NOT want a ruined vers. of the movies we all adore. It is time to shove his Midi-Clorins up his Behind and boycott this until he sees the errors in his ways and gives us back our beloved Star Wars.
2,Very Disconcerting Color,"Let me first say I don't care about the additions they've made, I don't care if Darth Vader yells No!I'm a Hollywood colorist and after watching A Phantom Menace, all I can say is Yetch!. It's painfully obvious this movie wasn't re-color timed for the Blu Ray release. So many of the scenes had a very disturbing magenta hue in the blacks and were otherwise so off that I found the movie almost unwatchable. In one cut the colors were great and then the next scene people's skin and hair color was suddenly different.I'm going to have to find a previous version of this movie to see if the same issues are there also.I'll watch episode 2 tonight and see if that's as bad. If so I'll see if I can return it and if not probably throw it away."
2,Force'd special ed =/,"I have been a fan of ""Starwars"" since I was 7yrs old! And I love the original Theatricle release, and the remastered (non-Special ed)version... But I must admit to being very dissapointed in George Lucas's refusal to release a Blue ray with both the original theatrical release as well as the new re-invisioned ver... I like watching the Original story where Han shoots first - Hello! Scoundrel!! not exactly a law-abiding, rule following guy... thats what made his change and growth so great!I like the option to watch the version I like, not have it force'd down my throat!! Till George Lucas comes around on Star Wars like the Blu-Ray of BladeRunner finally did, I'll stick with my DVD and VHS versions!Disappointing!!!"
1,can't say,"anything that hasn't been said. I'm a huge Star Wars fan. Huge enough to want the best for my beloved trilogy (the original) and this set isn't delivering the best, so I'm waiting until I, and the millions of other fans can have that. It's best for everyone."
1,NO Original Versions,"I refuse to buy this version without the ORIGINAL versions.If Leonardo Da Vinci was alive, what he would think about changing the Mona Lisa hair to blonde?"
1,'I have a bad feeling about this........',Why why why must Lucas continually tinker with these films? chipping away at what made them great in the first place everytime he re-releases them - ive written an open letter to Lucus - you can see it here -[...]please add comments if you feel stringly as it do about this.
1,"""If it ain't broke, then what's stopping us? Let's break it..."" - George Lucas",George Lucas is more machine now than man. Twisted and evil. For over two decades I've loved and enjoyed Star Wars. Before the dark times. Before the Special Editions/Prequels.
1,Dont buy!,"Boycott this set!! Make george lucas release the orginals or send a message by telling him to stop altering these films. The 'Nooooooo! to the famous scene where Vader saves luke is just plain dumb and silly. He continues to ruin the filmswe loved growing up and this is how he repays us by changing them, with cheesey dialouge and things that were fine in the first place. I have no problem with special effects add ons, butwhen you start adding dialouge, Enough is Enough....."
1,"More new ""improvements"" is the last straw","I was already very much on the fence about picking this up as I was quite interested in the new supplemental material, but was upset that the original versions of the original trilogy were not included, only the special editions of episodes IV to VI. Now word comes that Lucas has made even more changes to the OT, changing Obi-wan's call to frighten the sand people (for some inexplicable reason) and adding blinking effects to the ewok's eyes. Those are minor and by themselves wouldn't bother me too much, but he also just HAD to add a reprise to the ""NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!"" from the end of the Revenge of the Sith by having Vader yell ""NOOOOOOOOOOOOO!"" while the Emperor electrocutes Luke at the end of Return of the Jedi. Lucas' obsessive need to tinker with the OT is either some kind of sickness or he is doing it to stick it to those who would dare prefer the ""imperfect"" OOT."
1,NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"You've gone too far this time Lucas... Too far. I will not buy these films ever again in this state. STOP THE REVISIONISM.NEVER AGAIN UNTIL THIS ""NOOOOOOOOO"" NONSENSE IS CORRECTED."
1,Sadness,"I hope George Lucas will give the fans what they want ... The original theatrical version. After watching this version of the trilogy, I had to dust off and watch the old VHS versions to ""correct"" the damage."
2,Star Wars Blue Ray DVD set,I had high hopes I would enjoy this set. However maybe I am getting too old to enjoy the smart ass audio and the squeaky queen (first DVD). I then went to the Darth Vayda DVD and turned it off after 20 minutes. Yes visually very good but who is the audience for much of the silliness? Some oldies are classics of all time but Star Wars revisited after a decade or so somehow loses too much. It is dated!Dave
1,What were they thinking?,"Why must I continue to wait to get the original versions of the classics I remember from the 70's and 80's that inspired me and made me happy in so many ways? Why does Lucas Inc continue to butcher these classics that people love? If it's not broke, don't fix it (or in this case ruin it). I want the original versions on Blu Ray, none of this garbage you keep trying to pedal down people's throats because you think you are so cool now and know what's best for the people. You obviously don't know what is best and you are more at this point a dictator than an artist. Grow up and be a man and give the people what they paid you for over all these years. This is ridiculous."
5,YESSSSS are you guys saying George Lucas fixed The Phantom Menace Yoda to a better CGI version,YESSSSS are you guys saying George Lucas fixed The Phantom Menace Yoda to a better CGI version???I can't believe it! That's the ONLY reason I can't watch The Phantom Menace!!!! Thank God Thanks George!That's enough for me to buy!
5,Bonus Features?,"It is true, if you want just the movies you can buy the first three, and the second three separately for cheaper (about $80). But with those you only get the movies and some audio commentaries (2 per video). So if you just want the movies, do that, buy them separately, the come in nice boxes too. However, for a true, avid StarWars fan, you need the three extra disks of bonus features.I previously owned the full set DVD edition of these with all the bonus features, and I can honestly say that I watched every last one. Time consuming? yes. Informative? yes. Eye opening and meaningful? yes."
5,Must have for the Christmas List,"This collection will be under the tree this Christmas tree, I'm certain. We are a house of Star Wars fans. Young and old alike. To the 2/3s of reviewers who pan this release because George added a few more things, I predict, that he will release a cinemaphile (is that a word?) version using the original cut of the first three films. There is clearly a market for it and George has always managed find new ways to leverage the Star Wars franchise to grow the empire. I am giddy with excitement waiting for Christmas day."
4,Good but not great,"I agree, like everyone else they should have left the originals alone... however taking that out of the equation... these movies are STILL the BOMB!!! Soon Lucus will realize that he messed up and re-release a NEW un-edited version that you will have to buy... it is called marketing people! Happens everyday!"
1,The Dark Side of the Force Has enter into George Lucas,Growing up I liked Star Wars not loved it but liked it. With that said over the years I have went to like to hate. This is the main reason why. Over the years George Lucas has given us so many different versions of Start Wars and for some reason we seem to buy them all. I have never seen a creator Change their work as much as George has. I understand that cleaning it up and improving the sound is a good thing and i am for that. However adding voice overs and Scenes is totally uncalled for. I will bet that in a year or so there will be another version of this film maybe in 3d or something. I say wait until George comes up with another dumb idea to hurt and destroy this what was a good piece of work and film making before you spend your hard earn cash over and over and over again.
1,Why?,"Why make any changes? I really wanted to see these on Blu-ray but decided against buying them. I feel like it isn't worth the money especially after the ""NOOO"" addition. I ask myself, how many times do I really need to buy these movies? Especially when it seems like the fans aren't really appreciated. I feel like 'They' are wondering how many times will the fans buy these movies if we just change one little thing each time it is released. Pure marketing...which isn't a bad thing, just not interested this time."
1,No means NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!,"I was a sucker and bought the ""special edition"" DVD set back in 2004 when it came out. After watching those, I realized that I disliked all the changes that Lucas needlessly added in. I vowed to never buy another Star Wars release again unless it is the original theatrical version and they actually put some effort into making it a high quality release (no lame laserdisc disc non-anamorphic transfer). The new additions are terrible too. Darth Vader yelling No Nooooo! made me LOL and Obi-Wan Kenobi's yell sounds likes he just got his lil' lightsaber caught in his zipper. C'mon George, you are worth over $3 B-B-Billion, do the right thing and listen to the fans that made you all that money."
1,Please stop!!,I miss the original releases that were so magical when I was a kid. I had pre-ordered this but will cancel my order now that I've heard that he's added even MORE stuff into them. Done.
1,Just terrible,This complete saga set is one of the worst things to happen to Star Wars. Don't waste money promoting the bad behavior of George Lucas.
1,This Is Very Sad,I find this very disturbing that Lucas is still tinkering with these films. You could suppose it is his right to do so however he should give the fans a choice by releasing the unaltered versions. After all these films now belong to the fans just as much as they do to Lucas. I am glad so many people are taking a stand against this latest re-release of these films.George Lucas has spent the last 25 years destroying his own legacy. Why doesn't he just do the right thing and release the original theatrical versions for episodes IV-VI? It is the only fare thing to do.
1,WHY,"Viewing the Star Wars franchise throughout the years it seems that George is only interested in money, and yet he will miss out on the $$$ of his die hard fans by what he has done and continues to do with these films. So is he really only interested in money or is he just an idiot? In my sincere opinion I believe he's just a washed up has-been with no more vision, clinging on to a piece of Hollywood and popular culture - the really sad part is not only is he no longer talented or creative, he's just uncomfortably laughably bad."
1,These are not the films we fell in love with...,"Lucas's incessant fiddling with these films have utterly neutered their impact, turning them from the greatest sci-fi saga ever made into a laughable pastiche of what they once were. Avoid."
1,"No Unaltered originals, No Sale",I want the original three films with no alterations warts and all. I do not understand why this is so hard to do. Take the negative (or a good print). Scan it. Put it on blu-ray. There is obviously a market for this. Don't they want to take my money?
1,Hey George Lucas --- THIS is why you fail.,"Stop. Changing. The films.I just read an article about all the changes being made to the movies for the Blu-ray release. Blinking Ewoks I can get behind. It's minor. Even Vader yelling ""Nooooo"" at the end of 'Jedi', while unnecessary, is not as bad as the ""Nooooo"" at the end of 'Sith'. But changing Obi Wan's krayt dragon call so that he sounds like a retarded hyena is just... words... I can't... NO. Just NO, Mr. Lucas. NO. It doesn't even sound anything like the krayt dragon in the prequel film. How stupid do you think we are?I've had enough of George Lucas meddling with cinema history. It's one thing to go back and add some nifty effects. But Han shot first. Stop re-writing the films and learn the meaning of ethics.For these reasons combined, I am canceling my pre-order of the Blu-ray edition. THIS is why you fail, Mr. Lucas. I will not support your insane agenda with my hard-earned money."
1,Fool me once....,"We all took the changes in the first DVD's with a grain of salt, but there is no way I'm buy this Blu-Ray set now. It was bad enough they had to replace the Emperors hologram in empire and Anakin's in Jedi, but seriously another Vader NOOOO!, changing Ben's yell in ANH? Give me a freaking break Lucas. I wouldn't mind the Ewoks blinking, that wouldn't bother me, but the other two on top of the crap from the DVD's. I'm Done!"
5,Bummed that there's no theatrical edition. But going for it all the same!,"I'll be there this September, suffering through the prequels, and the annoying changes from the special edition. Can't resist Star Wars!"
1,Give us the original version please,I just would like Lucas to give us a release that contains the original version. I don't even care if he makes us buy his ex post facto artistic visioned crap along with it. Please...
2,Simon Pegg said it best,"You are so blind! You so do not understand! You weren't there at the beginning! You don't know how good it was, how important! This is it for you! This jumped-up firework display of a toy advert! People like you make me sick! What's wrong with you? Now, I don't care if you've saved up all your 50p's, take your pocket money and get out!"
1,Do not buy these hacked up pieces of junk,"Complete and utter junk. Lucas keeps playing with things. By things, I mean dialog and plot. Not things he should be playing with, like fixing the color. I want the full set of theatrical releases, you know the award-winning stuff, not junk like this. Maybe if we don't buy these, he'll come to his senses and give fans what they've been asking for years for - the real artistry of the originals.Where is the ""zero star"" option for these reviews???"
1,Han Shot First,Lucas shot second and continues to kill the series. Proves that old saying that the first idea is the best idea and you should leave it alone!!!!!!!!
1,One more voice among many....,"I just thought I would add my voice to the growing disgruntled fan base who are tired of shoddy remakes and the lack of an option to view the original versions. Lucasfilm, why ignore your fan base, and refuse to cash in on a surefire hit by DOING THINGS THE RIGHT WAY, not cutting corners on remastering, and giving us the chance to see the original movies as they we remember them?"
1,I started drinking today for an old friend,"I went to the store today with one goal in mind: to get hammered or wasted. The thing is, I really don't drink. I suppose it's a good thing that people can't come back from the dead, and no it's not because they'd be flesh eating zombies. It would be the sheer terror of Da Vinci wanting to add dinasaurs in the background that would ruin its cultural impact. Not to mention he'd probably give away any secrets ge may have had about the last supper.So here it stands, Lucas is a flesh eating bastard. He eats away at the same meal, until there are only bones and then he preceeds to decorate those bones with uneeded yellings and dreadful cgi bone eating maggots. Lucas has even gone so far as to desecrate Jim Henson's memory by using cgi to replace one of the most beloved muppets. Shame Lucas.I guess I could discuss more problems I have but I'd rather finish my rolling rock. R.I.P Star Wars the cultural movie I loved. Hello flesh eating mutant Star Wars!"
4,a sturdy collection,"All the movies, great quality video, great audio, heaps of extras...Actually, Phantom Menace has really grown on me since I first saw it, and with a good sound system the pod race is quite impressive ..."
1,George has a few things to say and do...,"George Lucas to the model builders and special effects crew who worked on the first trilogy from 1977-1983:""Your feeble skills are no match for the power of CGI.""(Lightning bolts come from George's hands and are frying his crew members)George Lucas to these same people as well as all Star Wars fans who wish George wouldn't tinker around with all six movies:""You will pay the price for your lack of vision.""(Lightning bolts are frying his crew members AND his fans)Collectively, everybody says to George, ""George, please!!!!!""(Everybody continues to get fried by the lightning bolts)George Lucas:""Now crew, fans, and all six movies.....................you WILL die.""(Lightning bolts are even more intense and everybody is screaming in agony)George wins, but only if you buy this set."
1,just putting my 1 star rating in,Just to support the movement. Everybody has said it all. George you need to stop. Stop messing with what was perfect as it was. I would prefer if you never remastered them them at all. I'm happy with my VHS copies.
3,"Review of Product, Not Film","Lucas opened Pandora's Box when he started tinkering with the films. It seems that whatever he does now, will still disappoint many of the fans of this series. When you are presenting a box set such as this, YES I would have liked to have the originals. Also digital copies are now the rule rather than the exception with this format. Last, on a minor note, the discs are somewhat difficult to remove from the packaging."
4,star wars,nice set a bit upset it is not original IV thruVI i saw at movies thats what i wanted not all added stuff
1,Lucas needs to look at these reviews!,"The fact that only the special editions are available digitally is appalling. I was hopeful that with the Blu-ray edition he would include both versions, but I seem to be ever the disappointed optimist. looking at the number of 1 star reviews here (71% of the reviews as I write this), I'm not alone. All the fans ask it that we have the option to see the version we fell in love with. To me it's like seeing a once beautiful actress, who was beautiful even with the flaws, have a bunch of plastic surgery to look younger, but instead of just aging gracefully, she now looks like some horrible pantomime of herself. That is exactly how these special editions feel to me, and frankly until the theatrical versions are available, Lucas can't have one red cent of my money. I am boycotting all products by Lucas Arts, not just these movies. Maybe then he might get it through his head."
1,Nooooooo thanks!!,"George Lucas is to Star Wars as what Michael Jackson was to his face.Order canceled. I was on the fence about getting this, but after another round of changes and edits these are no longer the films I enjoy."
1,"""No!"" and ""Noooooooo!""","Should you buy this?To answer this question, I will quote Darth Vader's new lines in RETURN OF THE JEDI.""No!"" and ""Noooooooo!""Send Lucas a message. Please don't buy."
1,Lucas and Company - PLEASE STOP!,It's simple Lucas and company:1) Fix the originals(IV-VI) so that they are the actual 'originals' we saw in the late 70's and early 80's.2) Add in the new ones(I-III).3) Put them all on Blu-Ray.4) Stop trying to make it better with new add-ins and CGI; you only seem to make it worse every time. Just give us the original movies we fell in love with!Is it really that hard?!
1,Don't support Lucas anymore,"Adding ""Nooooo!"" to the end is just shameful.These movies have been changed so much over time, they aren't even similar to the early 80's releases anymore."
1,Nooooooooooooooooooo...,"Removing the pole in the Wampa's arm is one thing. Even adding the lost Jabba scene to Ep. 4 ( as bad as the animation of Han is) was kinda cool, but adding these stupid lines where it is completely unnecessary and actually takes away from the drama of the scene just doesn't make any sense to me more than it offends me. I'm just confused. Darth Vader's silent internal struggle was iconic. Same as Han shooting first established him as the scoundrel he was and enhanced his transformation into a hero.I would buy the extras but if I want to see the movies in HD I'll just wait until the weekend and watch Spike."
1,Will Never Buy,"Not giving Lucas another cent to ruin a ""Classic"". There is no reason to further edit and add more garbage to a film he has already distroyed."
1,Obligatory one star,at least get the color schemes right.....Lucas is a nut. Really wanted this but must stay resolute and say no to lucas constantly fidgeting with this series...ENOUGH
1,An insult to Irvin Kershner and Richard Marquand,"Michael Jackson was a naturally handsome man, but he did not perceive himself as such, and this unfortunately led to self-mutilation over the years. George Lucas's irrational need to constantly ""improve"" his films has become creepy, not unlike Michael Jackson's obsession with plastic surgery. But in this case the addiction is CGI & Editing. Spielberg needs to arrange an intervention because Lucas may be suffering from some variant of OCD."
1,Fans say no to the abuse,"Is this what Star Wars has become the youtube joke of the day?Fans, say no to the abuse. George Lucas needs therapy, and the fans are tired of the different versions."
1,No Digital Copies? Order cancelled.,"No longer going to buy any Blu Rays that do not include Digital Copies. Simple as that. My life / work is so mobile, non Digital Copy offerings simply don't work for me."
2,"Poor Disc Quality, Poor Disc Container Quality","Firstly, this review has nothing to do with the small changes that were made to the series like many 1-star reviews here on Amazon. I do own this blu-ray set and did watch the entire epic (all 6 movies). The overall PQ(picture quality) and Sound IS an improvement (Excellent details, color, etc & demo-quality sound) over previous releases... *However*the video judder (skipping) and cheap (gets your fingers all over the discs) cardboard container is beyond poor for a product so hyped & with such a premium pricetag! The judder of the disc scenes is appropriately documented on several AV forums...I wish I had read them first! Be warned, I wasn't!"
2,Wait,"I would recommend not purchasing this item and waiting. Chances are George Lucas might realize that a good amount of his fans appreciate the changes that he makes, but would rather see the movies the way they were originally. After reading reviews that talk about disappointing sound changes that were made to certain scenes or visual effects that have been altered to the point of becoming a distraction. I'll just wait until George Lucas releases an ultimate edition that includes the original theater version, and all the altered re-released versions since then. We might have to wait awhile longer until after the new versions of 2020, 2024, and 2029. Hopefully by then we'll have the holographic room version that will fully immerse the viewer - by then I'll have forgiven that they ruined the Han Solo/Greedo scene and the great flow of the movies with so many new add-on's."
1,...and people laughed when I kept my VCR,"Lucas has made the movie equivalent of a 60 year old lady that can't get enough plastic surgery; the more they get hacked on, the harder they are to look at.I prefer the lesser video and audio quality of my original VHS than the DVD or BR versions that have been destroyed at the hands of Lucasfilm. Thanks but no thanks - I'm not interested in George's latest cash grab."
1,DISAPPOINTING! DO NOT BUY!,"Well I blew about a hundered bucks. Besides the things Lucas added (AGAIN), these blu rays really stink. I watched episodes three, four, five and six and they all have audio issues. That being there are several and I do mean several moments that the audio is muted, very annoying. If you have the DVDs just stick to them. There's not enough increased quality here to make it worth the annoyance. And you watch, ol' George will find ways to fix these and add more nonsense."
1,Please DON'T buy this!,Not only that this pack doesn't contain the original version of the classical trilogy but it's tinkered with even further. These are not the movies my generation grew up with.
1,Just say NO,Just say NO to this release!Mr. Lucas does not deserve to be paid for this destruction of cinematic history.I was never so disapointed
1,No Chinese subtitle,"Without Mandarin subtitle, I won't buy any blueray because my parent can't understand.I'm not asking for a Chinese audio, but at least it is easy to add subtitles other than those four languages."
5,I'm happy!,"I was a sophomore in college when the first movie came out....and I've owned SW on every format except laser disc and HD-DVD (or whatever that format was called). Now I have it on Blu-ray and I'm pleased. I expect this to be the last SW set I ever buy too. I will keep my DVD sets with the original movies, but I must say I'm not bothered at all by the changes Lucas made. Most of them are like a welcome surprise. I will say that I still have to watch ROTJ to see the famous ""NOOOOOOOOO"" scene and if I hate it I'll lower my rating. I should know after tonight. But so far, I'm good with this set.BTW, the movies look & sound great. High def really serves to great benefit when playing these files on a large screen TV. If you have kids (not really young ones, though), they will enjoy this! Movie night is clearly a winner with this set. Well worth the $80."
4,Star Wars,"Not much to say, it's Star Wars. I had never seen a full Star Wars movie and my husband wanted this so we bought it. It's not a collector's edition, basically, it's just the movies in a book. We like it, but it's not for a die-hard Star Wars fan, that's for sure. The delivery was quick and the price was cheaper than in store. Although, the front of the ""book"" has a scratch on it like someone went too hard on the box with a razor blade or something."
1,Heartbroken...again,"I wish I could get my hands on George's copy of The Seven Samurai and colorize it, add a bunch of cgi monsters, and change the subtitles to some new flashing font. Then I'd give it back to George and tell him it would be the only version of the film he'd ever get to see again, which wouldn't be true of course, because every few years I'd take it away and make even more unnecessary changes.How'd you like that, George? That's how you make us feel!"
1,Boycott this release. There...will...be...another.,"Fans of Star Wars, and more importantly parents of fans of Star Wars:You must listen to what they've done to the original movies and boycott this particular release. They have made so many terrible changes to the originals that they no longer have the magic they once did. If no one buys it, they will redo it. Stop being a mindless consumer and for once make the manufacturer deliver what we want to buy, rather than what they want to sell."
1,"Do Not Want.....anymore, thanks George","I was going to buy the Star Wars Saga on Blu-ray and was actually extremely excited to do so, that is until I saw the NEW changes made to the originals. I can't watch the end of Episode VI with Darth Vader screaming ""NOOOOooooo!!"" I REFUSE to do so. Thanks for the memories George."
1,The Blu-ray's suck!!!,"I cancelled my order because George has finally gone to far!!!!! How the hell did Artoo get in that small cave and how did he get out? The Darth Vader ""No"" yell is dumb beyond reason! The Obi-Wan yell is terrible as well. The lightsabers aren't updated or fixed? WTH?!!! George has gone mad!!!!"
1,This is not star wars.,Just canceled my pre order. Vader now screams NO NOOOOOOOOO when he toses the emporer down the shaft. LUCAS HAS LOST HIS MIND. I don't think I'm ever going to buy a new star wars product ever again.
1,*sigh*,"George is a great guy but he clearly does not understand that some things are best left untouched. His films made billions for a reason, now he is just mutilating them, it is a shame."
1,"All I have to say is ""NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!""","This is the final straw, Lucas really has gone insane. All I want is the original movies that came out in theaters in blu-ray quality. I don't want extra CG, I don't want horribly done voice overs and sound effects. Just give me the movies that won the Oscars because they are what Star Wars is really about. Don't waste your money."
1,Save your money,"I don't know what this crap is but it's not Star Wars. I remember being a kid when the original trilogy came out, standing in line of my local movie theater with my dad. It changed my life. But this is not the same movie. I suggest you buy a VCR and buy the VHS tapes. It may not be 1080p resolution but it'll be Star Wars damnit."
1,Why? Why? Why?,"I have been reading all the information I can read for the last 2 hours about the new release of STAR WARS on Blu Ray. I have to say that I was excited to buy them about 3 hours ago. But now, I am just going to pass and spend my $ on other things. I have them on DVD and will watch them in that format. Want in 1 hand and wish in the other."
1,stupid,"how to ruin good storytelling 101: muck up what is nuanced in characters; add distracting cgi; refuse to fix the larger technical and editorial problems in the classic series. Finally, ignore your fan-base while trying to sell them the exact opposite of what they want."
1,"It's not just the changes, it's the lies.","The problem with the changes is more than just the fact that they're fixing that which wasn't broken. It's the fact that they're grossly incongruous and don't integrate well at all with the original films. Vader's ""Nooooo"" is easily recognizable as being recycled from Episode 3 for instance. However, it's the awful color timing from the 2004 editions that we were promised would be fixed that haven't been corrected.Why would we be promised this was done only to have the blu rays unveiled with virtually none of the color timing issues fixed? I.e white colorless lasers being fired from the star destroyer in the opening shot. Yet time was found to further sully the classic films with more idiotic tweaks."
1,"Sorry George, try again.","The properly restored, original theatrical versions of Star Wars (1977), Empire Strikes Back (1980), and Return Of The Jedi (1983) will be the next things I purchase from Lucasfilm. I didn't purchase the 1997 altered versions, the 2004 altered versions, or the 2006 altered versions - and I have absolutely ZERO interest in these current abominations. This set does not contain the films that captured the public's imagination. The poorly done, non-anamorphic, DVD copies of the 1993 laserdiscs that were released as bonus discs with the 2006 alterations were a slap in the face to the fans who put George where he is today. I've never seen a situation where the director digs his heels in a this level and goes out of his way to make sure the fans get only something they've repeatedly said they don't want. It is truly an ego out of control."
2,Disapontment,"There's not much left to say about the contents of this edition. It is rather disaponting.Lucas is definetly testing the fan's patience and endurance in buying editions of SW, always with tiny modifications compared to the previous editions of the movies. A touched up effect scene, maybe a ""lengendary missing scene"", and a lot of mambojambo.All I expect from these new editions in Blu-ray is a spectacular transfer, breathtaking sound quality.About the lack of documentaries, it is obvious to me that Luca$ is saving them for a future release of 3D versions of the movies.Another thing is this ridiculous campy cover! What the hell is that?So, I guess I'll stick to my DVD editions a little longer. Maybe I'll buy the Blu-rays when they are cheaper.This box-set is not worth what they are charging us for it."
5,"Great Movie, Very Nice Presentation","The movie is perfect for playing in home cinemas and the sound 6.1 DTS HD is really HD. Honey for your ears. With a very nice presentation, like a book, is perfect for the collection. Highly recommended. Even for christmas is a very nice gift."
1,2 Words: Seamless Branching,All this added garbage and still no option for seamless branching? At least give us the god damned choice of which version to watch or allow us to create our own! The technology is there (see Close Encounters)! Had to cancel my pre-order after seeing the the leaks....
1,Makes little sense.,"I'm not even a big fan of Star Wars, to be honest, but I completely agree that Lucas has made a mistake by refusing to release the original theatrical versions."
1,Welcome to Star Wars. How may I help you?,"No need to review these films. George Lucas had dollars on his mind the minute he realized the merchandising potential of what he created right after the first film. This latest reissue (with modifications) is further proof that Lucas has been a businessman first and foremost for the majority of his filmmaking career. I'm finished being a fan of the series. Spend it wisely, George!"
1,If I could rate lower...,"The new Blu-Ray release. More unnecessary editing. Changing the final climactic scene. Sometimes silence is golden. Some things were bad... I let them go and bought the DVDs with the ""new"" scenes. Enough is enough George Lucas. I can only hope that Katie will have the decency to actually release the set that people have asked for. The ORIGINAL.FYI, anyone considering buying this you get newly editted Blu-Rays that have change some items but not all. Comic-con caught a couple of oppsies from the team. So I'm sure there will be more. Buyer beware."
1,I can't support this version of the movies,Seriously? There are more changes to the original film? I will not be buying these movies now. Ordered the set and canceled it after the news. Thanks again for making the originals matching the prequels in quality. Considering the prequels were mediocre at best.
1,WHYWHYWHYWHYWHYWHY,Why does he change? Why can we not have original Theatrical 1080P. Lucas is an evil evil fat ugly man with a neck that looks horrendous when it jiggles.
1,missing a dvd.,I ordered the star wars saga and it came to me missing the third movie. not good. be hesitant when ordering from these people.
5,Great features,Star wars is great and this is a great blurry collection! i was hesitant bc everyone was complaining but then i realized those are the avid-die-hard collect all the editions star wars fans.... i love the idea and i love the story.... i love the blu rays!! great buy!
1,I want Star Wars they way I remember it,"If you want to release an altered version, fine...but make the original also available. CBS made both versions of ""Star Trek The Original Series"" available on Blu-Ray. Until this Blu-Ray set is in the bargain bin for $19.99, I am going to pass. Special Thanks to George Lucas for messing up another one of my favorites....because of him, who knows IF we will ever see ""The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles"" unedited and the way it originally aired."
1,Order cancelled...,Unbelievable. After 29 years of being a fan I'm finally done. He will just release another version down the road taking these new changes out knowing that he will get the double dip AGAIN from whatever loyal fans he has left. Why do you think he is remaking each film for 3d??
1,This is BARBARIC!,"Years ago, George Lucas spoke out against filmmakers changing their art, going so far as to call it ""barbaric."" Well, years later, George has become the greatest offender of ruining art. True fans of Star Wars will ignore these Blu Rays until they are changed back to their original form."
1,Unnecessary changes,"Once again, George Lucas shows nothing but disdain for his own products and his fan base. To needlessly add dialog when none existed changes what made the films great. But of course he doesn't remove the bain of our existence, Jar Jar Binks."
1,Just stop already!,"I can't say that I'm surprised that Lucas has had his hands on the movies yet again and made more changes; however, I had hoped he'd leave them alone already...guess that was too much to hope for. The audio changes don't even sound right (i.e. Vader's ""noooo"" in ROTJ). C'mon George...give us the originals with the cheaper effects that we all grew up with and love. Quit playing around with them just because you can. Han shot first!"
1,Don't buy this,"Don't buy this! George Lucas makes changes to these movies, people complain, and these things sell like crazy. The only way to stop him from changing the movies any more is to not buy these sets"
1,The Last Straw,"I have never been a big fan of Lucas's changes to Star Wars over the years. This time though, he has altered the climax of the saga, inserting a moment which has become widely mocked (Vader's ""NOOOOOO"" from Revenge of the Sith) into the most emotional point of Return of the Jedi.And to think, Lucasfilm tried to slip the set onto the market without letting anyone know about the changes they made this time.I have been a fan of the series almost my whole life, and I have stuck with it through all the alterations so far. These changes, however, were the straw that broke the camel's back. I do not recommend this set at all.That is unless you desperately need a feature length documentary on some fans who cosplay as Stormtroopers."
1,disappointing price,So I've pre-ordered this movie in August thinking of saving money. Turns out Target and few other stores have it for $79.99!!! I wouldn't have need to pay a month in advance for it and I would have already have it in my house. I should receive it in 2 days with an extra charge of $7.98. Very disappointed. Not planning on pre ordering any again.
3,I bought it just to have the complete set on Blu-ray,"Some people like the earlier movies (4-6 in the final count), my brother among them, others prefer the final three (1-3 I guess they're called) I just wanted to be sure I could have them in HD format. I'm really vague about what I'm getting, hoping that while Lucas may have ""cleaned up"" the FX in the older movies that he didn't ""improve"" them like he did on at least one DVD release. I've read a little of Amazon's text and some of the reviews here- I'm still not sure what I've got.v"
3,Love Star Wars and this set but one thing,"I love Star Wars and this box set but very disappointed with what I discovers about it today. My mom bought this on May 4th, national star wars day, and got it for my birthday on May 19th. I am just now starting to watch all these on blu ray and got through the first two but than noticed that the disc menu for three was actually The Phantom Menace. After further inspection it appeared to be that they gave me two copies of Phanton and didn't include Revenge of the Sith. I plan on returning it and getting a copy that has all 6 of the movies but did anyone else have this problem?"
4,It a DVD,Im not necessarily a fan of the series but my Dad is so it was a great fathers day gift. Nice set.
3,The case is very bad,"The making of the blu rays are great, but the case is a trash. It's very difficult to get the disk out, why fox is so foolish on this?"
1,NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!,"Everyone has a right to do what they want with their intellectual property.Similarly, I have the right to express my displeasure with such exercises by refusing to spend money to support it.Just say, ""NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!"""
1,Enough already,I wouldn't care how much Lucas messed with the films if he ALSO included the *original* theatrical cuts. No sale.
1,George Lucas continues to make a mockery of his own legacy.,"Lucas' constant refusal to include the original theatrical versions of Episodes 4-6, and his continued meddling with them up to this point has brought fans past the point of outrage to a dull, numb sadness, or worse, a bitter gallows humor over the whole thing. These are not the films we grew up with, and not the films we loved.Boycott this product."
1,Star Wars boxed set Blu-Ray,"Is Fox out of their mind? 1:33 aspect ratio went out with hoola hoops.SCAM SCAM SCAM. Shame,shame,shame. DO NOT BUY IT. How many times do they expect us to buy these films? I've lost count, but here it is I think: going back to VHS twice, 12 inch Laser Disk, three times, DVD twice (thanks to widescreen and the extended versions) so that's 6 on the original 3 films. How about zero stars for Star Wars in full screen?"
1,Just say NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!! to George Lucas,"After many years of enjoyment, George Lucas has finally convinced me through these constant remakes and prequels that Star Wars really is lame. I guess the popular kids were right..."
2,I promised to stop giving money to lazy George Lucas,Regret I bought it. I know Lucas will keep tweaking his movies. I should have waited.I wish he would just get it over with and revamp all special effects from the original 3 episodes. But let buyers choose if they want the original or the new version.
1,Agreed! Definitely a fail!,True Star Wars fans will wait for the true Star Wars. No purchase from me but nice try Lucas! Maybe next time.
1,Let's all push for a pre-quel redo! and the inclusion of the Originals on Blu-ray,"They redid the Hulk, Batman and a whole host of other bad movie ideas... how about redoing these god awful prequels. Lucas just lost touch with struggle and challenges of life by living in his secluded fortress in Marin. Oh how I wish he would have left the prequels to the expanded Star Wars Universe creators or that he watched his films with a few fans and had an idea session before destroy the Star Wars world."
5,Excellent product,The films are classic. The packaging is fabulous. The quality of the audio and video is definitely a huge upgrade over DVD. Not much more to be said. A must own in my opinion. I love the THX clip at the end of the films. Its worth viewing the entire credits to hear that.
5,Everything has been fixed.,Lucasfilm and ILM has gone in and corrected the issues with the 2004 versionsThe Lightsabers have been corrected. The Audio has been fixed everything has been fixed. Go to DigitalBits.com and see for your self they attended a press event and they can tell you what they saw.You can buy with confidence knowing that this will be the best Star Wars has ever looked.
5,New Verses Old,"The Special Editions of the original Star Wars films have really grown on me.I like the cleaned up look, and the new mix is wonderful. I hear all kinds of little phrases of dialogue,that I can't hear in the original versions.I was wondering--and correct me if I'm wrong ,but isn't one of the great things about ""blu-ray"", the fact that you can store so much more information on it. Why not include the original prints of the film? I understand the argument ,that in HD,the older films will look that much more...I don't know..dirty? I think the only people that will even click on the option of watching the old versions, will be fans,and they want to relive the way they saw it as kids.I know I enjoy showing my kids the differences in each version. Why not make it simple and just include it all! Let this be THE definitive home release of the films. Much like the recent ""Remasters"" were for the Beatles."
1,Lame,"Just Lame, that is all I can say people, I am by no means a star wars fan, but god damn lucas, you are middle finger everybody one more time."
1,NOOOOOOOO,"If it ain't broke, don't fix it Darth George. You are the evil that all sith lords dream of living up to."
4,Badly designed bluray container,Do not like the design of the container. You have to pull out the blurays with your fingers resulting in fingerprints on them ..... Also they are hard to get out of the sleeve.
3,Han Solo shoots...second?,"Any version of Episode IV that includes Greedo shooting first is an abomination and should be summarily dismissed. To any fan of the original series, it is a key moment in the development of Han Solo's character. Without strongly incorporating his initial mercenary nature, his appearance in the end as savior to the rebellion loses all its impact. The reason people love Han Solo is because he is a rogue rehabilitated to hero."
4,Great Collection,Really great movies. I have always liked the Star Wars Series. One DVD didn't work and Amazon replaced the package immediately. I'm sure you will be please with it if you purchase the Complete Saga.Ken
5,Worth the money,The orignal movies cleaned up great . Now my son is hooked on Star Wars . Sound quality is amazing .
4,"If you're a Star Wars Fan, why are you reading this review?","Go buy this now instead! A great compilation with amazing quality. A number of behind the scene discs which I've not yet gotten through, we've just watched all of the movies. But am looking forward to watching those too. The only reason I gave it four instead of five stars is the packaging. It's hard to get the discs out and I fear scratching them every time I do."
1,"Why, Lucas? Why?","Will you never stop? I was at least considering getting the blu-ray versions. That was until news came of even more alterations. More of whatever it is you consider perfection. I used to fret at all the remakes and reboots of every other franchise out there like everyone else. Until I realized that our great originals still exist. But not in this case. You have stolen the originals, the classics from us. We'll never have them again. Or at least have them as we should. Suck it, Lucas. I'm going to watch Firefly."
4,Is what it says it is,"For those of you looking for a relatively reasonably priced set that includes all the movies and is Blu-ray, this fills the bill. If you are a true fanatic, the things the other reviewers point out will probably annoy you. If you just want to watch the series with your kids, this set is fine.As far as the changes are concerned, the only one that truly annoyed me was the addition of the young Aniken at the end of the Return of the Jedi. In addition to be a change, it also didn't make sense - why wouldn't it be the mature Aniken as in the original? I could have done without the added Jabba the Hut scene, but I remember thinking the same thing 15 years ago.Sound is great throughout. Picture quality is fine."
1,George Lucas reminds me of Michael Jackson,George Lucas' gradual transformation of his movies is reminiscent of Michael Jackson's gradual transformation of his face. It has gotten progressively worse and almost completely unrecognizable. I think both of them suffer(red) from pretty severe OCD and have/had no insight as to what they were doing.
1,NOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"All I have is what many Star Wars fans are already professing, an utter feeling of desperation as George Lucas slowly rapes the last vestiges of our childhood (s). It can only be summed up in one phrase, I quote:""NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!""Thanks for nothing Lucas. I will not buy this item, and I can only hope that you re watch the films and realize why Ivan Kershner was better than you. You might have made the first film (and unfortunately the prequels), but you can't be responsible with the historical, cultural, and personal significance it holds over millions of people. Shame on you sir. Shame on you."
1,More changes?? *sigh* ...,"This release is a huge disappointment. I wish George Lucas would've left well enough alone and stopped tinkering with the original films, but the changes never end. I won't support any new ""Star Wars"" products until the original trilogy is properly restored and preserved as the important piece of cinematic history that it is."
1,"Just say, ""Noooo!""","With the ridiculous dragon call by Obi-Wan, and the ""Noooo! Noooo!"" added to Jedi, save your money. What an absolute waste. Why can't Lucas just put the original releases in glorious HD and be done with it? Leave the crappy add-in effects to 13 year olds on YouTube. Giving this fleece job one star because I can't give it zero."
1,Just not a compelling package,No original versions available and the rest is a very mediocre package. Also the additional changes that they made to this is just very unnecessary and often the more and more they change the more it detracts from the movie.Thing that Lucas doesn't get is that if there were fully restored original theatrical versions of Star Wars (The good Trilogy not the crappy prequels) no one would care about the changes that Lucas could and will make.Pass on this and demand a print with theatrical versions.
4,and Arrived Early,"First, this arrived one day prior to its official release; one more reason to keep on buying from amazon. As for the actual product; since there were no details available pre-order, I was expecting the master Lucas to release this version in 7.1 surround, but it came in at 6.1. The sound is tremendous, however. I watched Episode IV last night and I remembered how it was actually John Williams who should have become the multi-billionaire, because without his music, that movie in particular is pretty hokey. Hokey or not, the movies are what they are, enjoyable as a piece of our living culture. I am grateful to be able to enjoy these movies in the well upgraded BluRay video, and especially the sound. Enjoy yours."
5,Great Blu-ray's,So after readings tons and tons of pre reviews ripping apart this release. I have to say after receiving the product I am overly impressed. It's too bad all the fan boys have rated this down just because some minor things have not been fixed. Oh well.
2,"We still DON'T want these altered versions, George!","Lucas, you meddling buffoon, we are still not buying your awful ""special"" editions of the original trilogy!You can keep putting them out on every new format that arrives, but we will keep *****ing all over them like they deserve.Release the original theatrical versions, you tool!!!"
2,Dont give Lucas more money to destroy this franchise,"I will not buy this blu-ray set because of the changes, all of which are listed here. The added Nooooo in ep 3 is unforgivable it totally destroys a great scene. I have the 2004 versions on dvd, I have long since lost my VHS copies of the original releases which pains me to no end. Until the original releases come out I will not fork money out for this rehashed garbage."
1,No means NOOOOOOOOOOO,I won't buy the blu ray for the simple fact that all of the changes that Lucas has made are unnaceptable for my viewing pleasure. Had Lucas included the original versions then I'd be game. Looking forward to the unaltered ET on Blu Ray. Thanks for returning to the light side of the force Mr. Spielberg.
1,*sigh* Yet another version...,"Over the years, I've bought these movies on VHS, I've bought them on laserdisk, and I've bought them on DVD. Every version gets farther and farther from what I saw on the big screen back in 1977, 1980, and 1983 and I see no evidence that these new versions will be any different.I'm done.Once the original versions of episodes IV, V, and VI are available I will gladly buy them on Blu-ray, but until then I'm content to stop buying close-but-not-quite versions of these classics. I'm tired rewarding bad behavior."
1,Add me to the boycott,"Those of you 4 and 5 star reviewers are traitors. There I said it.If you're willing to pay for another version with the horribly done additional footage then you are not fans of Star Wars. You're fakes.The movies were PERFECT. The additional footage only made them worse and should have been added as extras, not forced on us like revisionist history. I cannot in good conscience pay for another version of these films in their present state. They only detract, not enhance as the extra footage for the Lord of the Rings trilogy did. It's obvious that Lucas has lost it....look at episodes 1-3. Terrible. And Chrystal skull? Give me a break.All effects, crap plot.George...there's no reason to not give us the cleaned up original cut. You're just being stubborn."
1,Only one of the Discs actually played,Episode VI plays without problem. Not a single other disc in the set plays in any BluRay player I have tried. Any other disc locks up my players so tight that they must be unplugged to retrieve the disc.This is on a Sony BluRay with up-to-date firmware.
1,eww! they changed things AGAIN,"It sounded nice to have all 6 movies in one blu-ray set ... then I found out they changed things.No sale George. I was willing, albeit grudgingly, to accept that the changes in the theatrical re-release were the movies now, as long as the original was an extra on the disks (insert grumble about anakin's face here). Just adding darth yelling 'no!!!!!' before the emperor's swan song now though was enough to ruin what integrity the film had left. Enjoy losing the sale."
1,Do not return merchandise,"I ordered this product by mistake since I have only a regular dvd player not a blu-ray and they would not play on the regular dvd. Amazon charged me almost $50.00 for a ""restocking fee""! I exchanged it for the regular dvd set and am enjoying it immensely. Word to the wise - Watch what you order!"
3,Help!,"Anyone else having problems with the menus on the extras discs? I upgraded my Blu Ray player, but menus still keep freezing for about 20 seconds."
1,No! Noooooo!!!!,"No original, unaltered trilogy. No sale. I truly hope George Lucas listens to his most ardent fans and someday releases the films we love so much they way they were in the theaters."
1,Not the movies that I saw as a child.,"These are not the movies that I saw as a child. These are not the movies that I grew up with and sparked my love of Sci-Fi. These are not the movies that won Academy Awards. These are not those movies, those have been changed and are now something else."
2,Please stop.,"There's a lot to like about this set as a fan of these films (IV, V, VI especially), but why oh why won't you stop ""improving"" these films Mr. Lucas. I know you have the right to do whatever you want but it really was more compelling to have Darth Vadar silent when he threw the emperor down the shaft. As a fan of silent cinema, I thought you knew the meaning and power of silence. You were obviously trying to tie ""Nooooooo"" to the ""Noooooo"" in episode III. When I watched episode III in the movie theatre people laughed out loud at that scene. Never a good sign. It doesn't ruin the film for me completely as it seems it does for some but it certainly takes me out of the film and disconnect during such a key dramatic moment in the series. The transfers are beautiful on bluray for sure and sound amazing."
1,Insulting,"I feel like my childhood is being robbed somehow...Artists should be legally restricted from altering their published works, without public approval.I won't be buying this."
1,"Well Done George, you've finally done it.....","You have finally made me turn my back on Star Wars. Making Vader shout 'Nnnoooooo' as he throws the Emperor to his death, what were you thinking. Stop surrounding yourself with Yes men, like your little lap dog Rick McCallum and listen to what the fans, the people who have given you their money for years, want.I could put up with Greedo shooting first, barely, that scene alone destroyed the character of Han Solo. I can understand a CGI Yoda for TPM, that makes sense, but having Vader shout 'Nnooo',come on. We can see what Vader is going through without you having to add some real crappy dialouge. You have destroyed a pivotol piece of cinema and put the the final nail in the coffin of destroying what was once a great trilogy.I have cancelled my order and will not bother with this piece of crap until you come to your senses and release the original untouched trilogy in HD.See ya George."
1,"Everone, it's time to let go...","Like an abusive spouse Lucas will hurt you again and again. He won't change. Luckily I am not a Star Wars fan anymore. I grew up and realized that outside the space of my childhood even the OTrilogy aren't THAT great. Please do not continue to make this hack rich. Outside of some innovation in special effects shooting he is a no talent scrub who caught lightning in a bottle by retreading other movie tropes into the sci-fi genre.He's not worth your geek angst. Grow up and move on to REAL cinema not the consumerism as art that Star Wars is. At one time it had some artistic weight (unlike say BayFormers), which makes the current state of this franchise all the more pathetic. Save your money. Or better yet buy a Blu-ray of The Godfather or Se7en. Or if your into something more ""pulpy"" Pulp Fiction and Jackie Brown drop next month. Leave Star Wars in your memories because it's present will continue to be a world of suck :-)"
1,Never again...,"I'm done, I have the lasserdisc box... the tinkering has sworn me off of lucasfilm. What's next Willow re-released with ewoks instead of brownies?"
1,Stop Messing Up My Childhood!!!,"Between ""Jedi Rocks"", the ""Noooooooo"", Greedo shooting first, Ewoks blinking - I just can't take it any more. I had pre-ordered this in May when it was first announced but cancelled when I heard about all of the additional changes that are going to be on the blu-ray. It was bad enough that it was going to be the ""Special Edition"" but now there are EVEN MORE CHANGES???!!!?!?!?To date I have purchased 4-6 on vhs, 4-6 THX remaster VHS, DVD special edition 4-6, DVD 1-3, DVD 4-6 original cut. Enough is Enough Already.George Lucas stop messing with these movies!!! They started out great but are just getting worse and worse.I will not pay $90 to get kicked in the teeth anymore."
1,"Simple, new Star Wars = garbage. Give us back the movies we love.","Lucas - Restore and release the Original (and in my opinion, the ONLY) Star Wars Trilogy on Blu Ray. Make all the violated Special Editions, crappy Prequels and stupid cartoons you want, but let us have the originals, lovingly restored and cleaned-up to modern HD standards. You won't get another dime from me, ever, until this is done. No discs, downloads, figures, conventions, etc. You don't bite the hand that feeds you, but I guess it will take cutting your sales figures back to draw your attention back to this fact.DON'T SETTLE FOR THIS RELEASE!!! IF YOU WANT THE ORIGINALS TO EVER GET A RESTORED, HD RELEASE, YOU CAN'T GIVE IN AND BUY THESE SPECIAL EDITIONS!!!As far as the Prequel additions and improvements are concerned, who really gives a crap. It's sort of like polishing a turd.NO SALE!!!"
1,One Question,"Star Wars is consistently on the top of the AFI (American Film Institute) list of one of greatest films of the 20th century. I have only one question for the people that give five stars, for whatever reason, to this abominable set.Which version of Star Wars do you think has been catalogued by the AFI?If you give this set five stars because you grew up with the prequels then you need to educate yourself to realize the rigorous critique a film undergoes to even be reviewed let alone accepted by the AFI. They would never accept anything other than a pristine unaltered print and neither should we. Older fans who gave this five stars should hang their heads in shame.Zero stars..."
1,It's a trap!,"Like others here, I've cancelled my preorder after hearing about these changes. I want color and sound fixes, not adding visual and dialog abominations to a near perfect original. I'm even OK with adding deleted scenes, but adding visual and audio crap *on top of* something that was already there is completely unnecessary. Not buying these. No thanks!"
1,RAGE,"was anyone else filled with a blistering rage when luke said ""I am a Jedi like my father before me"" and it cut to that whinny Hayden Christensen!?!? anyways are they going to have superimposed him at the end of Jedi because i wont support that no mater how much i love Star Wars"
3,Mixed Feelings,"I thought the picture quality was fantastic for all six films.What I did not like at all was the difficulty in removing the blu ray discs from their individual cases. I know that blu rays are difficult to scratch, but every time I reach for a disc and try to pull it out of the sleeve I feel like I'm going to scratch one! Either that, or I'm going to accidentally tear the paper sleeve that the disc is in!Who was the 'genius' who designed this?!"
1,"Return of the Jedi - ""Nooooooooooooooo""","The title says it all. Stop changing these movies. Remaster them properly, and release the original versions.George Lucas is just doing this for the money. There's no reason to give him more for crap."
1,"No Theatrical Version, NO SALE",Speilberg puts 3 different versions of Close Encounters on Blu.Coppola puts 2 different versions of Apocalypse on Blu.Alien Anthology? Both theatrical AND special editions on Blu.George Lucas? Holds his breath 'til his face turns Blu.No sale George until you put out a version of the ORIGINAL TRILOGY that's at least equal to the FAN versions available.
1,Horrible Cover. Please Change,"I want this set badly for the extra 3 disks you cannot get with the other packs, but i hate the cover. Why cant it be the all black cover with just the title on it that i saw when i originally pre-ordered it. when i saw that it was changed to this i was so disappointed. C'mon Lucas do you have to ruin everything???!!!!! Get Anakin off the cover. He should never be the focus of the entire saga."
3,DONT GET TOO EXCITED,"Let me start by saying, none of us including myself should be reviewing an item on Amazon that hasnt even been released. I agree with the fans who prefer to see the the saga as it was originally filmed. Everyone that would prefer to see the ""extra footage/ cleaned up version"" I ask you this, Can you be 100% sure that George isnt going to spring something on you in this release that you dont absolutley hate, or even more simply, that the movies are going to look that much better (they are taking 33 yr old footage and 33 yr old special effects and giving you 1080p). Are you serious?? I seriously doubt that the original saga can be remastered AGAIN to the point of WOW. That being said, I will return to my original thought, ""none of us know how this saga will look, at this time it is just SPECULATION AND OPINION, therefore Amazon should save some credibility and turn off the review links on items until they are released."
1,Enough is enough!!!,"You can volunteer to let George Lucas continue to punch you in the groin if you'd like but this is the proverbial straw that broke for me. Adding Vader's ""NOOOOOOOOO!"" over the scene where he pitches the emperor into the shaft at the end of RotJ is just going too far. I should've quit buying this stuff years ago on my wife's recommendation but I was unable to see the light at that time.I'm sure the quality, etc... is fine on the BRD's themselves but I just have to stop willingly handing over massive amounts of money to a guy who can't even see (or simply doesn't care) that he's killing one of the greatest franchises in cinematic history.I am officially done buying Star Wars merchandise until the original theatrical editions are released on Blu-Ray."
1,Bait and Switch,"What disappoints me most about Lucas is, not the fact that he keeps ""updating"" his ""abandoned"" movies, but when he does make these awful changes, he forces his audience to abide them and disregards their personal preferences by not releasing the original/unaltered versions of the original trilogy. Also it seems almost as if he were sneaking these changes in to get us to purchase a product not-as-advertised, as we only recently discovered these changes, so close to the release.It's a shame that the most we can do is simply cancel these pre-orders, as it's not likely Lucas will have a change of heart."
1,Poop,"Maybe when Lucas dies my kids, kids, kids will be able to watch a release of everything as it was. Until then pick it up with a doggie bag and boycott this Poop."
1,Blasphemy,Everyone has said it above. It's ridiculous they can't release the originals we saw in the theatre. I was 6 years old when I saw Star Wars and I still clearly remember the Stormtroopers breaking down the door in the opening scene. What a memory. George you suck.
1,George Pukeus,"Have seen videos of the new alterations on youtube, ever since '97 all these alterations keep making these movies worse. WE WANT THE OLD ONE'S BACK!!!! THE OOOOOLLLLDDD ONNNEEE'S!!!! I've never seen a movie this popular, treated so shabbily, all everyone wants is the originals exactly how they were, with only modern cleanup methods used to make it look good. I've seen low budget 80's horror flicks that were given better treatment than the re-released DVD originals (disk 2 on the separate dvd versions). Once and for all, I mean I don't care how many horrible new movies you make, people can avoid those if they want, but if we wanna see the movies we grew up with we have to either watch a grainy ugly looking version that doesn't fit properly on modern tv's, or a crappy brightened version (vader has a pink sabre) with new horrible music, fake computer crap & new dialogue crammed in 30 years after it was made. This is so WEAK!"
1,"Please, for the love of cinema, take a stand and DO NOT BUY.","When I watch the Star Wars trilogy on my 90"" projector screen... I'm still watching it on a 15 year old laserdisc. Why? Because I want to watch the movies that were originally created between '77 and '83. So-called ""warts"" and all. Everything Mr. Lucas has released since 1995 ARE NOT THESE FILMS. Break the abusive cycle, and DO NOT BUY THIS SET."
1,"Only a true ""fan boy"" would buy this trash.","I find it funny how every one of the people that gives this atrocity 5 stars (or more than one for that matter) tries to paint those that are angry about his lame revisions, as ""fan boys"". The real ""fan boys"" are the ones that buy whatever Lucas puts out regardless of quality.They're buying a $90 (discounted price) set that includes 3 classic films that have been mutilated and 3 films that were never good to begin with.And we're the ""fan boys""?I'm going to spend that $90 on something that's worth $90. If someone wants to give me this set for free I wouldn't mind... I could use some beer coasters. I used up all the old AOL free trial discs I used to use for that purpose..."
1,Noooooooooooo more changes,"There is nothing more I can say that hasn't been said by so many others. Seriously George, no more of these changes. It would be so easy to offer the original theatrical version as well as these changes..."
1,DONOTWANT,"There are few bigger, more ardent fans of the Star Wars Saga. I'd long made peace with the fact that, for better or for worse, Lucas was going to tinker with the OT. I was still willing to purchase the BD set, until it was confirmed by the New York Times that the rumors about adding a NOOOOOOO to Vader in RotJ are in fact true.I'm sorry, but I draw the line here. At the climax of the entire Saga, the culmination of all that is good between the Prequels and Originals, Lucas has utterly and completely destroyed one of the best moments in cinema. He has displayed an appalling disdain for the fans who have been loyal to him and made him one of the richest men on planet Earth.All fans should simply refuse to buy any BD, of Star Wars until Lucas realizes that his peers, including Stephen Spielberg, are on the right side of history, that the originals should be preserved, maintained and made available.Just say... NO."
1,Please make it stop,"This is not a review for the ORIGINAL films, but a review for all of the previous changes, and even the new ones that were made on THIS edition alone. George Lucas needs to release the original theatrical cuts in higher quality already, and stop giving the fans inferior products."
3,Love the new Blu ray format,"Who cares what people say about how bad this format is.If you love Star War and a die hard fan this is a must have and also to support George to make other one with 3D and fixed the some CGI.I own all the formats of Star Wars VHS, VCD, LD, DVD and now the Blu-ray set which is great with very detailed picture quality which looks 100+ time sharper. I love the extras too.The audio is much better with my new 7.1 amp.I was sick of the DVD quality on my big HD screen.With the HD CGI rendering, there were some bad scene with the CG + live footage which did not match that well, apart from that over all I am very happy with this Blu-ray set.I did not give a 5 star because this format dose not have 3D and audio is not 7.1.I cant wait for the UltraHD format when it comes out or if it comes out."
1,George Lucas knows what we want...,"We want the theatrical versions on Blu-Ray! It doesn't even have to be dedicated, theatrical release-only editions...just include it as a special feature, for example, like was included on the older DVD releases. I refuse to buy any of these until the original, theatrical releases are included."
1,Not StarWars,"This version is not the old StarWars. Why is Darth Vader talking in the scene helping his son? I don't understand George Lucas. The authentic movie is awesome, please, don't change it!"
1,This is a joke!,"I bought this disc on the day it released. I watched episode 1 and 2; and part of episode 3 on the weekend. Today, when I tried to play the rest episode 3, a red screen poped up, telling me to update my blu ray player! My blu ray player is very updated! My question is: WHY ON EARTH, this disc can be played a week before, but can not be player later on?"
4,"I wasn't about to comment, but....","I understand all the fustration out there (with all the one star ratings). However, you must admit, this is an awesome box set! The sound and video are top notch, you cannot ask for anything better. Be realistic, does it really matter (in a scene from ESB) if Lando said, ""attention"" once or twice?, OR, the color of R2D2's panel is blue or black?, OR, (in a scene from ROTJ), Luke is shown hugging Antilles?These are relevent only to the perfectionist. It doesn't matter if all the ""I's"" are not dotted or all the ""J's"" are not hooked up the the left. This is not LOTRs where 30 - 50 minutes are not included - these are minor issues.Just enjoy the movies because they are that good!"
5,Don't judge until youv'e seen it,"I respect everyones opinions on why they don't like the remastered versions or the prequels because they have good reason to do so. Han's really shot first, they replaced the original ghost vader with hayden cristensen and Jar Jar is the most rediculous thing iv'e ever seen, but it's still star wars and we all love it. plus at 90 dollars were really gettin half price. new Blu ray movies cost around thirty dollars a piece and were gettin 30 hours of bonus features so theres really no reason to complain. If someones gonna post a comment on Amazon whining about the price just don't buy it."
3,Which Format,"Personally I don't mind it being the newer versions, I just want to know if anyone knows for certain which aspect ratio will be used? Amazon says full screen but this seems a wast with a blu ray."
2,No original version,"Very disappointed to discover the original releases are not included.I am sure the ridiculous edits to tie in the prequels are also theonly version available, sorry but Boba Fett is not from New Zealand!"
1,I will not buy these again.,"James Cameron hates it, Speilberg has come around, but George Lucas has not. I've always said that George can do as much as he wants to his ""vision"" but give us an untouched theatrical edition on another disc. I don't mean crappy laserdisc transfers either. That's not acceptable in 2011. I will not buy these movies again until the original version is included. Not only are you tweaking your movies, but now messing with the emotional climax to Return of the Jedi.Enough is enough."
1,Know what you're getting,"Until yesterday, I think we all knew what we were getting- all of the changes made up 'til 2004 plus maybe a few new ones. But then we learned about the ""Noooooooooooooooooooo"". Return of the Jedi was not without its flaws. But this critical moment of Vader's sacrifice for his son, his own redemption, and the end of the galaxy wide conflict was not only the highpoint of Return of the Jedi, and a highpoint of the whole trilogy, but it's also a classic moment of film history. Ask yourself if you can enjoy the finale to the Star Wars trilogy with this new version of the climax. I know I cannot. Save your money, folks. The hobbyists are doing what the professionals choose not to... Ask your geek friends. They will know what to do."
1,Noooooo sale.,"When I heard that Lucas had inserted ""No"" (TWICE, no less) into the climactic scene of RETURN OF THE JEDI, my reaction of disbelief was instantly replaced with the sad realization that yes, clueless Uncle George would actually do such a thing to a wonderfully underplayed scene.Send George Lucas a message and stop buying his crap.Long live the ORIGINAL original trilogy."
1,Joe H.,"I was 8 years old when Star Wars 1977 came out and it changed my life. Like most I have hated many of the changes Lucas has made to the original films, some of the changes were decent some were just awful. I was an avid Star Wars collector, but now I feel I wasted my life and money over the years. I have helped Lucas built his empire with my cash, well I can say no more, I was a fool. I am in the process of selling most of my Star Wars collection. I don't want to have anything to do with Star Wars now, he has ruined it for me. After reading all these reviews, I will not be purchasing the Blu-Rays."
1,I wish I could wish this change away,"I could live with most of the changes George made. Adding more digital creatures? Sure. Greedo shoots first? Well, it's stupid but whatever, I can blink my eyes and miss it. Add Hayden What's-His-Face to the end of ""Jedi""? Uh, I guess it makes sense.But making Darth Vader yell ""noo!"" when he throws the Emperor is the breaking point. That's the most pivotal scene in the trilogy, and he trashed it. I'll never buy this set. DVDs are good enough."
1,ugh,"ah, guess I'll put the money I would have spent on this set towards buying the laserdiscs on ebay. And a laserdisc player. Worth it!JUST STOP ALTERING THEM PLEASE GEORGE PLEASE"
1,No Theatrical Release! No Purchase,Why doesn't George listen to the Star Wars fans. All we want is the original release with minimal restoration (no additions). I will NOT be supporting this money grab!
1,"If you love the original trilogy, don't support this","Lucas can't help himself, maxing more bizarre scene changes. Buying this will only encourage him to do more. Please don't reward Lucas for the destruction of the original trilogy!"
1,Lots of material MISSING from this Blu-Ray set....,"The biggest omission here is obviously the '77, '80 & '83 Theatrical versions of the Original Trilogy (the 1997 theatrical and 2004 video versions aren't included either, if anyone cares), but there are a lot of deleted scenes still in the vault that disappointingly aren't included here, nor is the Star Wars Holiday Special, nor the documentary ""From Star Wars To Jedi: The Making Of A Saga"" nor is the documentary ""Empire Of Dreams"" which was included with the 2004 DVD set. The theatrical trailers from the '04 DVDs are missing as well. Hopefully the NEXT blu-ray release will include all of the above."
1,Color me done with this,"I was not enthusiastic about this release, what with owning these films in multiple versions already. But as the release got closer I found myself contemplating making the purchase one last time to have it on BluRay. But, reading that they've made even more unnecessary changes, I'm done. I will not be spending any more cash on this franchise."
1,"If Han doesnt shoot first, it isn't really Star Wars.","I got excited thinking how cool this was going to be. Then I realized, its not the Star Wars I wanted to see. The special editions were ok for a change, but I want the originals much more than the do over."
1,"At leasst throw us a bone, Mr. Lucas","Sure, Star Wars is his creation and you can do whatever you want to your creations. The only thing is, if you are going to release a BD version of a movie that has had multiple changes, INCLUDE THE OPTION TO STILL BE ABLE TO WATCH THE ORIGINAL THEATRICAL VERSIONS! A BD disc is 50GB. Don't tell me that there was absolutely NO way they could have added those in?I'm so sick of George Lucas and his pandering. I will not buy, download or even watch these newly changed versions."
1,The passing of cinema history.,"One of the most important scenes in the final Star Wars movie cycle has been altered beyond all recognition. Where there was silence and profound emotion there is now ridiculous dialogue. I've never been into the whole geekdom of Star Wars, just a normal guy. But when you change beautiful moments in cinema this much, its like changing the final scene dialogue to Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. Lucas has officially just defaced art. I wonder what young George Lucas would say? Oh yes...""American works of art belong to the American public; they are part of our cultural history. People who alter or destroy works of art and our cultural heritage for profit or as an exercise of power are barbarians, and if the laws of the United States continue to condone this behavior, history will surely classify us as a barbaric society.""George Lucas speaking at Congress 1988.....George Lucas is officially a Barbarian."
4,Good Buy,"First of all, i have to say the artwork is pretty good. I had read many negative reviews, mostly complaining about the changes...i really dont mind most of them, and i really like quite a few. Many hours of extras, documentaries, etc, plus the 6 movies make it well worth the money."
5,Muy bien!!,"Perfecto!! muy buena compra, y lo mejor es que es multiregion asi que se puede ver en mi ps3 español."
3,Blue Hoth?!,"I really enjoy all the extras on the blu-ray. I don't really care about the small canges to the movies, it doesn't change the story, although I could live without the ""No!"". The only thing I'm really dissapointed in is that the horrible blue tent is still on the originals from the DVD release-I read somehere they fixed that, they didn't. I'm all for changing things up, I just wish they would make more of an effort to make sure the change is for the better. But these people who have gone from loving Star Wars to hating it-if you don't like an altered version of Star Wars then simply don't watch it.I recently saw the Adywan Star Wars edit-<...>and was very impressed. It's literally a perfect example of what a tweaked Star Wars movie should be. Every change made the movie better, made a movie I've seen a hundred times new again.With the 3D versions approaching Lucasfilm has yet another chance to get it right. May the force be with them."
1,Crapping on a national treasure.,"Okay, I'll keep it short. There's really nothing to say that hasn't been said in here already. Very disappointing. Actually, it's not Vader's Jedi ""Noooo"" that's broken it. It was actually Greedo shooting first, thereby completely altering Solo's character. King George has truly forgotten what it was all about and what made us love it. No, I won't be buying the Blu Rays. I still have my originals on DVD, and that's what I watch. Should the original versions ever be released in Blu, absolutely."
5,greatest box set of all time!!,"i've waited forever for this box set to come out and it finally did!! not a huge fan of the prequel trilogy and not a big fan of the enhanced versions of the original trilogy, but none the less these movies and this box set takes a prominent place in my movie collection. they could have made the sleeves a little differently to be able to remove the discs easier but it holds them in there nice and tight. and the back page of the set is a montage of photos and the main 3 characters of the original trilogy (Han, Leia, Luke) have been given a very small section of it and are hidden by the booklet. there are more prominent pictures of characters we hardly know or care about. the bonus discs are a wonderful addition and add even more value to this set, with footage i've never seen before!! great price from Amazon as well!!"
2,"Missing Disk Episode 5, two bonus disk 1","Well, I pre-ordered this long ago and waited, waited, waited. Arrived without a disk for Episode 5, with bonus disk 1 in it's slot. There were 2 bonus disk #1s and no episode 5.The changes made are very hokey. Dissappointed."
1,"Until there's a theatrical release version, please don't encourage Lucas by buying this","Until there's a theatrical release version, please don't encourage Lucas by buying this. I don't care if he puts both in the same box but the option needs to be there. Enough said."
5,Amazing Bluray,"This is a must have for any die-hard Star Wars fan. I know some reviewers knocked certain aspects of the set, but the fact that the movies are in High-Def completely out weighs all the ""missing"" items. I don't regret purchasing this collection and you wont either. May the force be with you!!"
5,Star Wars in all its glory!,"The STAR WARS: Complete Saga Blu-ray box set is amazing! 9 blu-ray discs total, packed with tons of extras and bonus features.The best, of course, is seeing the original trilogy brilliantly restored in full 1080p.Not only is the imagery spectacular, but Ben Burtt's ingenious sound design and John William's majestic score are absolutely stunning.Not only that, but this boxed set of a total of NINE (9) blu-ray discs is available for an unbelievable $90. The average retail price of a single blu-ray movie is around $30, so you're already saving over 65% off retail!This is a must have for Star Wars fans. You will not be disappointed.Pros:All 6 Star Wars feature films in full 1080p HD resolution.3 Bonus blu-ray discs featuring documentaries and bonus material.Stellar sound and imageCons:Blu-ray sleeves are somewhat awkward, but not a big deal."
1,"Oh, the humanity!","People, please! This man Lucas will only ever respond to his pocketbook. If desperate fanboys keep sucking up whatever he chooses to spew at us, he'll never do what we want. No one is saying George can't tinker till doomsday with his feature-length toy commercials if he wants to. But are we really asking so much to ALSO want the originals available with the same loving pristine attention lavished on these hybrid, pseudo-movie abominations??? Please don't buy them yet or he'll never learn."
1,No self-respecting fan will buy this,"After the endless backlash against the previous changes to the films and the incoherent revisionism done to the mythology, you would think he would leave good enough alone. But changing the films again is Lucas spitting in the face of his fans and laughing all the way to the bank. He is simply too arrogant and narrow minded to admit to his many errors and restore them back to the way they should be. If the gullible fanboys still but this tripe then they are just as guilty for supporting it. The ironic part is the abominable prequels will never be altered. To Lucas these are perfect masterpieces."
1,A NO Hope....,"As we have all heard, Fuhrer Lucas' increasingly out of control OCD is on full display here, when he should be putting his time toward another three films while most of the original cast is still alive. I'm sure Mark Hamill needs the work.Seriously. Lucas thinks people will buy this AGAIN just to see Ewok eyelids and the further pussification of Vader? They're his films and he can tweak them all he wants, he just needs to keep it to himself for his own private wanking sessions."
1,Don't make Lucas richer by buying this junk.,I'm boycotting this release like I did with the Lord of the Rings Bluray Theatrical release. Don't buy this release until they fixed ALL of the problems!
1,Star Wars is dead to me,I don't know that there's anything to say which hasn't been said. I'm utterly convinced that Lucas has no idea what made the original movies so good in the first place and I have no intention of giving him anymore of my money for ruining his own legacy.
1,???,waiting for the original version to come out .. thanks for wasting everyones time Lucas!... it would have been satisfying for you but the million other fans see different you could have at least put an edited and unedited version on the disks and let the viewer decide instead of deciding with a boycott of an otherwise decent blu-ray release but now why bother?
4,"Pretty Good, Not Perfect","Overall, this set looks very good. The best Star Wars has ever looked. There are a few places where a new transfer using the most current technology would have improved the set and it is a little disappointing that they didn't do this. I have to assume the cost of re-working the newly added CGI to an all new transfer and restoration of the original source material was prohibitive (i.e. there weren't enough people who cared by withholding their wallets to make it worthwhile). I must admit that with the (mostly) great looking picture and the excellent uncompressed audio, I did feel for a moment like a kid watching this for the first time again. Even the prequels, possibly since they can be watched in a more relaxed manner free from the weight of their original anticipation, seemed to work much better for me. Not perfect but well worth buying."
5,Star Wars on Blu Ray,The new Blu Ray version is better than seeing the original flicks at the theater. The color and detail are amazing! You'll feel like you're on the set with the characters.
5,Star Wars finally on blu-ray!,"After getting the set and watching all of the movies (and most extra features... I'm still not done!) i must say that whether you like the changes made to the movies or not, the truth is that the movies have never looked better. I've found myself noticing things i hadn't before. The image is so clear and beautiful, i was amazed. The sound is AMAZING, and i was pleasantly surprised by how great the films sound. I don't have a fancy surround system, but still managed to feel the explosions in my gut, and even the beauty of the score is enhanced.The new bonus stuff is fun so far; a lot of stuff i hadn't seen before and can say that i learned new stuff about a saga i thought i already knew everything about.I definitely recommend this to Star Wars fans; the set has a lot more going to it than against it. Don't let the ""hate"" flow through you."
1,Lucas must be stopped,"Fans of these movies want the real movies, not George Lucas's 4th alteration of them. The prequel movies are universally viewed as inferior to the original trilogy, yet with each tinkering George makes the original trilogy more like the prequels - lots of CGI with no heart. Blu-Ray technology easily allows Lucas the ability to incorporate more than one version of the film, so if he must alter them over and over, he could at least include both versions (or even all four versions at this point). Lucas doesn't care about the fans. He doesn't care about quality. He cares about getting paid billions of dollars more to fund his next Star Wars alteration - the 3D version that's coming, with doubtless more ""surprises"". This is not the product most fans want, so it's being rated poorly. Hopefully sales for it will bomb and Lucas might finally get the message."
1,noooooooooooooo,"George, star wars not need any editing, they are classics (specially original trilogy), no more editing please, get a life."
1,NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO,"George Lucas once again finds a way to ruin his series.Every day, the rights of movies end up in the hands of d-bags who ruin them for the fanbase. But not Star Wars. Lucas is like ""YOU CAN'T RUIN MY MOVIES IF I RUIN THEM FIRST!!!""Lucas needs to hide in his mansion and just leave Bioware in charge of Star Wars. Kthanx."
1,Disapointing,"At some point George Lucas needs to decide that these movies are finished products and not something to be continuously tinkered with any chance he gets. These most recent changes only work to demonstrate how out of touch he is with directing and film making. With this he's taken what was a incredibly anticipated release and turned it into a PR nightmare and a huge disappointment that only continues to build resentment towards him and his ""product."""
1,NOOOOOOOOOOOO = pre-order cancelled,"""They're his movies...."" blah blah blah. My pre-order was based on what was advertised: the Star Wars Saga - NOT a ""new version"" of the Star Wars Saga. The SE included many unnecessary changes that I could live with, but these changes are shoddy in their execution and reveal that Lucasfilms knows nothing about character arc, subtlety or quality. Someone who works there needs to say 'no' to George. I recently heard someone say Lucas added the ""nooooo"" because of his laughable ""it's like poetry stanzas"" excuse. That would be like saying ""since I used the word 'night' at the end of the 3rd line, I need to make sure I use that same word at the end of line 6."" Good poetry is not a sing-song rhyme.I was looking forward to the archival discs, but there's no way I'm shelling out even $90 just to have those.I'll Netflix those or wait til these are clearance-d somewhere.If Lucas was DaVinci the Mona Lisa would now look like Lisa Simpson"
1,Too many changes - this is vandalism,"This will not be the version we all long for nostalgically as adults, this version has been vandalized. There are many changes that alter the look and feel of the original, and they are not well-done as the Star Trek TOS Blu-Rays. This has been hamfisted and poorly revised."
1,Noooooooooo way.,"You can see a growing trend here. People that actually like these movies don't want them messed with anymore. The movies that need ""fixing"" (or rather remaking entirely) are the NEW ones. Mr. Lucas, focus your efforts there please.Vader screaming NooOOOooOO in the Jedi doesn't ""rhyme"" with Ep3. It doesn't provide a nice ""double"" effect - except in that it makes Jedi stupid...like Ep3.Ugh..this is wasted breath."
