2,I'm not yet happy with it...,"As the author of this book, I would like to inform the public that this book has been discontinued, by me.I am not quite happy with it yet. When I am, I hope to get it published in the form it should be seen. After 25 years of working on it off and on, I suspect that should be some time soon...;)-Casey Fahy"
2,Brew Cone 5 Stars...Travel Mug 1Star,The Brew Cone is wonderful...mmmm...freshly brewed coffee for every cup.The Travel Mug is another story all-together. The seal on the lid is tenative at best. Mostly leakes coffee with every sip. I won't use the lid anymore. Otherwise it's a pretty mug.
1,Just get the cone,"The good points: the blue color is as gorgeous as it looks in the picture. The metal interior keeps beverages warmer longer. The sip hole is closeable, but not leak-proof. The cone method is awesome for someone who only drinks one cup at a time and doesn't want to fuss with a coffee-maker.The bad points: within twenty days of receiving the mug, the lid's seal was leaking and dribbling in two places from merely one use or less a day. The bottom of the mug was not cut flat and wobbles dangerously, making gentle stirring a two-handed production. Calling for help was a bear because of different customer service companies handling different Melitta products. The manufacturer refused to replace it because it was purchased online.To sum up: get the cone alone for a cheaper price either online or at the store. I use it with another commuter mug daily and love it. The Melitta mug is junk."
1,NEVER BUY THIS PRODUCT,"This is the worst product I have ever bought. In fact, I had bought 3 of this disaster and had to throw all away as useless. Its one function in life is to hold coffee, and it can't do that because the lid falls off if there is even slight wind. If you want to buy this product, just flush money down the drain."
3,FYI,"As many have said the cone is great for single cups. Also I keep it around at work, to make my own coffee instead of using the burned community coffee pot. You know... you can buy the cone alone, without the mug. I purchased one for $2.99 elsewhere, and love it. I just use one of the many mugs(regular and travel) I already own."
3,ehhh,"I bought this as a gift for a coffee lover and it is great to take with you everywhere and make a perfect cup every time. One thing that was not good with it is that the metal top comes off and leaves glue all over the mug. Also, it tastes like metal. The manual drip cup is excellent and holds the filter in place. It would definitely be better if the mouth opening was plastic or a better material."
2,The travel mug is a joke,"As the other reviewer said, the brew cone works wonderfully. Throw away that fancy $150 auto drip that sings Dixie. This little cone will make better tasting coffee.However, the travel mug is a joke. The lid does not seal or lock shut in any way. All you can do is simply place the lid on top of the mug, and hope it doesn't come flying off when you hit a pothole while driving... and don't tilt the mug too far back when going to take a swallow, because the lid might pop off and scalding coffee will pour all over you. This has not happened to me yet, but it has leaked and dripped out on me. Not fun.However, the travel mug is well insulated and can make for a suitable thermos for home, as long you are aware that you should not drink directly from the mug while the lid is on."
5,Great First Puzzle,"My son, 16 months, loves this puzzle. I was hesitant at first because I found it expensive, but it proved to be worth it. It is a great first puzzle that makes him feel successful. Once he became comfortable with putting the puzzle back together, I made it more challenging by hiding the pieces around the room. He loves this game :)"
1,Lost words?,"This book is pure jibberish. Even as a lover of the English language in all of its versatility, I found this book to be a waste of paper. I believe mad lib are more entertaining than this! A nice cover, but a horrible book!"
5,Loving it!!!,"Nice looking, good grib, and...it's still made in France (where it is supposed to be coming from)."
4,"Sabatier Au Carbone 10"" Chef's Knife- A Great Knife","The Sabatier Au Carbone 10 - Inch Carbon Steel Chef's Knife, is lighter and sharper than most German made Stainless Steel knives. And because of it high carbon content, it requires more care in terms of frequent sharpening and immediate cleaning after use. However, you will find that it will take a sharp edge quickly and easily and the blade has bite and balance, making slicing, cutting and chopping easy and safe.Care for this knife by washing it, by hand, immediately after use. Dry with a soft towel or cloth and then gently rub the blade with paper towel lightly dabbed in vegetable or olive oil. Rub away any excess oil on the blade with a clean paper towel before putting your knife away. This will help prevent, but not eliminate discoloration and prevent or eliminate rust. Prior to each use true up the edge on a steel. This will become one of the best knives you will ever use. NEVE PUT THIS KINFE IN THE DISHWASHER."
2,Karim Rashid : Evolution,Too much about the personality and not enough about the thinking. Layout of book makes it hard to read.
2,didn't last a month,"Less then a month after we received this DVD player it stopped working, we returned it to Sony for a replacment but they didn't have one so the ""repaired"" this one. 3 weeks later (a long time in my opinion) we received the ""repaired"" one back, and the motor was so loud when playing that it wasn't really useable - so back to Sony again. It's been about a week now and we haven't heard back on whether or not they are fixing that one or if they have any replacement units yet. Don't recommend it. It's also a little on the heavy side (maybe some people would like that). Our last one was a panasonic 50 (old version I think) and it died after about 18 months - we thought that was unacceptable so we bought the Sony - but in retrospect I wish we had bought our old one again. It lasted longer, was lighter weight and the screen tilt was more versatile."
1,DVD Frequently Freezes,"I've had the same experience as so many others here, I wish I had read these before buying. It will be play along just fine for awhile, then suddenly just freeze up. Turning it off, reinserting the DVD does not help because of the memory feature of returning to the point where you left off--it just returns to the ""stuck"" point. The only way to fix it is to insert a different DVD, wait for it to start, then remove and replace the first one and try to return to the place where it froze. Then it may well freeze again again somewhere else after a few minutes. or it may be fine for the rest of the movie. I've tested the same DVD in my regular, stationary DVD player and it works just fine, so it's not the DVD. Also, it happens on too many DVDs for it to be a problem with the disk. I've just wasted nearly $200.00."
1,quit working,"DVD player quit working after three months. When it does come on, the sound does not work. I would not recommend buying it."
2,Mine died a quick painless death,"I bought this unit for long trips for the kids and was impressed with the way the rotating screen would allow it to be placed in various positions in the car for viewing. Unfortionatly, the glossy screen of the Sony made it virtually impossible to watch in a vehicle, even with tinted windows. Even putting towels in the windows helped little. The kicker was the fact that the unit died during the first movie played. Screen just failed. I was worried about the base units connection to the screen with the rotating feature, and it appears my worries were justified. Returned it and bought the Toshiba 1900 instead. I am much happier with the slightly larger screen and the lack of glossy luster on the screen. Also, it's still working after watching several movies."
1,11 MONTHS AND I HAVE TO,I have had this item for 11 months. It is now given me trouble. My movies stuck as well as other dvds. It is built well but that doesnt make for a good player. I use this about 20 hours per week on the job. Due to the nature of my work.I have had to make another purchase and replace this one. DO NOT BUY IT.
1,Crappy quality,We purchased ours for our daughter to watch in the car. It hangs on the back of the passenger's head rest. After a few months it failed so we sent it for repair. We received it back and two weeks past the 1 year mark it stopped working again. We contacted Sony to learn that they'll repair it for $120 or send us a REBURBISHED one for $150-$167. You can buy a new one online for $169 with a new one year warranty.
2,didn't last long,I was very disappointed the player only lasted 2 years. It did not get a lot of use. I am a fan of Sony products. Don't know what happened to this product. Now I am out of $200. Not very happy.
4,Awesome design,"I purchased this portable DvD player as my old one got burned out. This is a very sleek in design. Very easy to operate. The battery life is good, can stand upto 5 hrs. It can play everything from MP3, CD, Burned DvD, VcD. The sound quality is good enough inside the vehicle. The resolution of the screen is sufficient enough you can ask for a portable player. The amazing thing of this player is the swivel screen, so you can hang it in front seat. For a great price I got from Amazon, I couldn't ask for anything else. Nothing is perfect so I give it 4 star."
1,It worked for four months!,Bought it in September 2007 and it worked until January 2008. Locks up when playing a disk. About 20 minutes into it actually. 90 day warranty has expired (by 1.5 months) and Sony will send you a refurbished model for $33 or fix yours for $126. Refurbished means other broken models that they have fixed and now will send to you. Very funny costs since I paid $189 for mine. After complaining about this I was told that they would pay for 75% of the repair cost. Now I can get a refurbished one for $33 or they can fix mine for $31. Figure that one out. I will be listing it on ebay as damaged. So you can bid on mine and get the same outcome as a new model. I will not buy from Sony or Bestbuy again!
1,Arrived deffective -- sent it back. So far no refund and had to pay postage. Not happy,"The cable arrived deffective. It was a very cumbersome porcess to send it back. I had to pay for shipping. I believe that my credit shoould include shipping both ways. The company says they don't refund shipping at all, either way. I have asked for a refund of the shipping, but havn't heard yet. Meantime, there has been no refund at all. I'm not happy with the customer service at all. The whole thing has been a rediculous red tape nightmare."
3,Just ok item,"Picked up this item last minute before a family road trip when our cheapo, no name player died. It appeared to be a great item. This player is great except for the sound. We set it up to be suspended between the front seats. Our 3rd row seating could never hear the player at top sound. When we entered a rain storm the 2nd row was unable to hear the player, and they were front row. Our cheapo setup that died was at least 3 times as loud as this one. Also, why is the remote almost half as big as the player?"
3,disappointing purchase and service,"This unit has very good picture and sound quality. However, the speaker on our unit malfunctioned in less than a month. What a disappointment after paying over $200. To top it off, the customer service from Sony has been frustrating. It has taken close to a month to receive a replacement for a defective unit."
2,"Low Picture quality, Glossy screen. Sound is good.",I was disappointed by the Picture quality.very Low resolution. Screen is glossy and makes screen still worse. Sound is good. Model looks sexy. I would recommend Toshiba than Sony. Toshiba Pict + sound are excellent.ShashidharAM Bangalore INDIA.
2,looks good unless you use it,"I bought the Sony because it seems better made than many of the other portable DVD players I looked at. I like the black case and the compact battery. However, despite its good looks, it does not work well.1. The sound is very poor. 2. Picture is very dark, lots of reflections and hard to get the screen at a good angle to see the movie well. I like to be able to SEE and HEAR my movies!!!"
2,Region-1 (US) player only,"This player will only play region-1 (USA) DVDs, so very disappointing. I paid $200 for this, whilst my $100 Accurian one plays all regions."
2,LOOKS COOL BUT PICTURE QUALITY NOT GREAT,"I agree with the previous reviewer. The design is great, but the picture quality leaves much to be desired. Large pixels on the screen and limited viewing angle. I'll keep it, but I expected more."
5,Amazing DVD Player!,"We have had this DVD player for five years now, have used it extensively and have never had even one issue with it. We love it!! We move around a lot and so are continuously using it on long car rides, plane rides, train rides, and boat rides. It has been especially helpful in keeping my 7yr old occupied as he has been using it since he was two. The only reason we are looking to get a new one now is because of operator error (a plastic piece of a dvd case got lodged in it and did some damage)."
4,Sony Portable CD/DVD Player DVP-FX810,"I really love this player! The only draw back for me is the volume. It does not get loud enough. I already had a pair of sony SRS-A20 battery powered speakers for my sony walkman. I hooked them up, and now my player jams! I have always had good luck with sony products."
2,Please dont buy this,"Good color. Horrible viewing angle. Almost impossible to watch comfortably by yourself, forgot two or more people. Clever design, horrible presentation. If you must buy, make sure there is a healthy return policy."
5,Excellent Player,"After alot of research and reading reviews I purchased this player, which im glad I did. I bought this DVD player to keep my 4 children occupied during long car trips, baseball games and practices. The sound quality is fantastic, battery life is great. The player runs very quiet much different from my old player. The only down fall is the screen doesnt have a mat finish therefore sometimes it makes it hard to concentrate on the movie when you can see your reflection. I plan to inquire into a cling flim that will go over the existing screen to reduce the glare hopefully there is such a thing.All in all this is an excellent Player and I would highly recommend it."
2,Mediocre is key,"My godmom bought this player for me as a Christmas surprise, and I finally got the chance to use it earlier this week. I'll be honest, it's not the best. It was hard to view and the volume was meh. I was not impressed. I've been using it to watch movies for a class, since the computer chair isn't as comfortable as my bed, and it was very difficult to see the darker scenes.Also, it seems to be difficult to find a case for the device. I'm afraid to keep it out of the box, in case it breaks. Over all, I wouldn't recommend it for anyone that's got contacts or glasses. It puts far too much strain on them.I would recommend spending a little more and getting a larger screen with better resolution. It would make things far more enjoyable for the viewer. As it stands, I might try and sell it after this week. I can't imagine trying to watch my DVD sets on this."
2,loved it while it lasted...but did not last too long,We bought a higher end DVD player so it would last. It played well for 1 year but then all of a sudden just stopped playing DVD's. From looking around no one fixes DVD players they want to buy a new one. So my advise is do not buy a high end DVD player I am now going for a cheaper DVD player with the expectations that it will last as long as this SONY.
2,Sturdy but...very POOR SOUND,"I bought this for my mother for christmas. She likes the picture and how easy it is to use. However, the sound is turned all the way up and the voices on the movies are like whispers. I'm very disappointed. It's been good for a laugh. My mother is 86 and sharp as a tack. She tells me, ""Well, it's gotta good picture; I didn't know they were making silent movies again."" Thanks Sony. For anyone but my mother this thing is a boat anchor."
5,Way better than the $100 Generic player that I had stolen,"My daughter is 9 and loves this machine. Since she started school a few years ago, she's been stuck coming to work with me over Spring, Summer and Winter breaks. For some entertainment, we got her an el-cheapo brand (Craig?) that had a much smaller screen, didn't look or sound so good, and worst of all, would hardly play for an hour off battery power, and would even stop unexpectedly when plugged in. I think we had it almost five years when it got swiped from the office, so we replaced it with this Sony 8"", which has been just terrific... I think she's watched two 90-minute movies in a row without AC pwr. My only complaint would be that it doesn't play Blu-Ray or HD DVD's, and the screen doesn't project holographically like R2D2."
2,"Too heavy & ""thick""; died after two months of light use","This is my second portable dvd player. I would neither recommend nor purchase this model again.1. It is too heavy and ""thick"" (my laptop is smaller and lighter)2. After only two months of light use, it completely DIEDI'd steer clear of this model."
2,Doesn't play edited dvd's,I edit my daughter's dvd's to remove the title screens so I can more easily play them for her in the car (she is three). This unit refuses to play the edited dvds. Otherwise the player seemed fine. I returned it and got the Coby 8 inch swivel screen player instead.
2,Looks great - did not last long,"This is a beautiful DVD player (outside). However, less than 7 months of light use (used ~ 4 times) the player died. I wish I had bought the extended warranty :(."
3,Uninspired,"Lilting vocal scoring, which is well done by the vocal group. The content, while some is pretty, is a little slow and boring - on the whole, uninspired."
5,Tito is back with more classic salsa,"This release by Tito Gomez is by far one his best albums. This album displays Tito's unique talent for salsa and contains beautiful upbeat rhythms. All the songs are lively, extremely danceable and bring out the fervor and strength of his voice. After a wonderful production-""Agradecimiento"" in 1993, it's comforting to know that Tito Gomez still continues to deliver some of best salsa that ""la musica tropical"" has to offer. This album does have some exceptional tracks and they are: Deseos y delirios, Rosas y espinas and Volver. If you are a fan of Tito Gomez or simply a fan of salsa, you will enjoy this one. No doubt about it!"
2,Should be called Roger Penrose attempt to expose his work,"The book starts of good and in chapter 7 he breaks of completely from superstrings and starts talking about some new unheard of idea of things called twisters. This would not be bad but twisters are supposed to replace spiners. Spiners to the uninformed are just a very small part of superstring theory.An example is writing a book on a 1998 Corvette and writing about the car for 6 chapers, then the other chapters are about the plug wires. Very Disapointing. If you want to read about some real superstring theory buy any book by Michio Kaku, much, much better books. They actually stick to what they say their about."
1,Deception,Ozbo will send you a Stand instead of an Cabinet and you will still pay the full price given on the site. This company is deceptive and a rip-off so buyer beware.
1,Not as described,"I have not tried this paring knife as yet. However, I am extremely frustrated b/c the description states the knife was made in France and it was made in China. I never would have ordered it had I known it was made in China."
5,A film well done...,EJ's best film ever since 'Live In Bacelona' from 1992. EJ takes you to his concerts and friends. Best film for every Elton fan.
5,This video/documentary is excellent!,Any EJ fan will be thrilled with this purchase. A completely honest and open EJ astonishes you with his tantrums as well as the somber moments. I definitely recommend this purchase!
5,Another Rambler,I now have two. Yes I bought another because I've had the old one for many years. This little knife does it all for me. Having its own phillips screw driver is way better than a small blade used for a phillips. I carry it every day and use it as needed. Very good knife.
5,the perfect pocket knife,"I'm on about my 10th one of these. This is the perfect pocket knife. It's small enough so that you never notice that it's in your pocket. It's got a phillips screwdriver that amazingly works on just about any phillips screw large or small, scissors, bottle opener, tweezers and toothpick. I use this for something or other just about every day, can't tell you how handy it is."
5,Excellent product,"This company makes quality products. This little knife is very handy with a scissors, diamond file, knife, screw driver. Sharp edge on blade and scissors."
5,Best Small Knife,"The rambler model is the best small knife. The scissors could be a little more sturdy. The philips screwdriver is outstanding. That thing can get anything unsrewed that you can fit it in. This is a very handy little tool. Get it on sale, and it is even better."
1,couldnt sleep for a week,"I rented this off netflix, thought this was a typical who dun it thriller, and it was. Kasey is a good, what I call a very underrated actor, even if he is riding on his brothers coat tails a bit. I cant for the life of me, understand why kasey signed on to do this movie and partake, in my opion, what has to be the most disturbing, movie scene ever filmed (worse than casino by far). It was completely unexpected, even as it was happeneing I didnt understand why it was happening and he just wouldnt stop beating her. I guess now having a wife and daughter really struck a nerve.I have always enjoyed the ""saw"" series and praised ""hostil"" for it originality, but the killer inside me really put me down. I wish I had a heads up before watching. i have to give it one star for sensless."
3,Nasty...but compelling.,"I have read Jim Thompson's novel, and I thought that the character Lou Ford killed the boy sent to jail and it was described in detail. It's been a while since I read it, so I'll have to check.In the film, Lou simply got a call to find out that the kid hanged himself. The killing scene was not in the film, or was the movie I saw censored? I'm not sure.I sometimes wished for subtitles, as there was a lot of mumbling and I couldn't always understand all that was being said. One has to admit that the period detail of 1950's Texas was well presented.The character Lou Ford actually appears in one other Jim Thompson novel, ""Wild Town"".He used Ford again in ""The Transgressors"", but later changed the name to Tom Lord.3 and a half stars for me."
2,"MICHAEL WINTERBOTTOM, OPUS 16","The sole cinematogratographic elements of Jim Thompson'sThe Killer Inside Mewere Joyce and Amy's extremely violent beatings but that was about all. The rest was a psychological description of Lou Ford's behaviour (Did you notice Freud's books in Lou's library?). According to me, the director by using flashback sequences, an off-screen voice and static shots of Affleck's face missed the point. Already forgotten."
3,Killer inside me,Kinda weird and a lot if sex in it. I like suspense movies but I didn't realize it was so sexual. Aside that it was good.
2,Really? That's the pay off?,"SPOILER ALERT!Well it didn't start off well with Casey Affleck trying to mumble his way through a bad Texas drawl with Baahstahn undertones. Seriously just change the backstory on the character if you're going to go with Casey because he can't pull it off. Despite that it was at least interesting enough to pull me in and keep me engaged even when he's bedding not one but TWO women completely out of his league.And then came the end...apparently no one in that town had any sense of smell whatsoever. And gasoline is only flammable from a muzzle flash, not the cigar he's smoking right in the middle of it. Took this movie from a solid 3 star, weak 4 star to a weak 2 star. If I could do 1/2 stars, I would."
2,ALBA BEATEN INTO A BEEF!,-Boring sex scenes galore but probably aimed at adolescent joy and ultimately for lack of story;-Good shocking scene where Alba is beaten like a punchbag;-Sometimes the film wants to be funny but sounds totally out of context ;-Ridiculous ending.-Throw the DVD in the trash can.
1,"One of the most horrible, violent movies",I could not even get through the first half-hour of this movie. The graphic violence toward women is so disturbing it is unwatchable. There is a creepy tension in this movie that is not good and the length and graphic nature of the beating to death of a woman should make this movie rated X. DO NOT WATCH this awful movie.
1,Horrible.,"I wish I could have my mind erased of this dreck. I didn't watch the whole thing, but I watched about two minutes too much. I have enjoyed many violent films, such as Reservoir Dogs, Kill Bill, Saving Private Ryan, and Natural Born Killers. Showtime's Dexter is my all-time favorite show. Casey Afleck pounding Jessica Alba's face to a pulp while she tells him she loves him is not something anyone should watch. If someone enjoyed this movie, I would not want that person for a neighbor. It is a crime against humanity that this film was ever made."
2,"Astonishingly disappointing, and I was looking forward to it...","I was looking forward to this being released on DVD since I like the actors and actresses, overall, and I like ""serial killer"" movies.What an astonishing disappointment watching it turned out to be.Casey Affleck's character is exceedingly boring. The plot is just flat silly. And Simon Baker's character has far too little screen presents.Rent it before you buy it and I doubt you'll buy it."
3,i keep being told its only a movie,"well i finally got the want to watch it after purchasing it, oh i dont know how long ago. but i didnt really like the beating of the women at all. ouch! actually the first reason i didnt like it was because it was a western, i think, and im not really a western fan. all the actors did very well in their parts, of course. is not a bad movie. now wonder when ill want to see ""ride with the devil"""
4,Intense and Disturbing,"I had never heard of this movie or the book it is based on before I saw it the first time. I watched it with no preconceived notions. Frankly, it stunned me. The intense violence and sociopathic behavior seemed more real than the usual graphic violence encountered with say a Hostel or Saw film. This felt very real and seemed even more intense because of the detachment of the killer. This wasn't movie violence. This was criminal violence. I had witnessed a dark part of the human soul and was troubled and frightened by it."
4,Worth the Watch,"This is an interesting movie, not at all what I expected, love Casey Affleck in this role, I would have never imagined him in a role like this. It's worth watching, for the storyline and knowing it's based on true events. Very naughty, be warned!"
3,Fascinating Yet Repellent Noir,"Jim Thompson's ""After Dark, My Sweet"" and ""The Grifters"" were successfully translated to the screen twenty years ago. ""The Killer Inside Me"" has to be labeled as virtually unfilmable which explains why it took them so long to adapt it. The dark impulses of the human soul are explored here unsparingly and at times you are repulsed and want to look away but for the most part you are riveted. It helps that director Michael Winterbottom leavens the horror with a healthy dollop of black humor. It also helps that Casey Affleck humanizes what is essentially a psychotic monster. Make no bones about it there were times while watching this I was compelled to turn it off and dismiss it as artfully made garbage. How else can you describe a film whose themes include child molestation and sado-masochism. Nonetheless, I give this film a qualified recommendation worthy of discussion about it's artistic merits."
2,is it over yet?,This movie manages to be extremely violent and sick while also being fantastically boring. A major feat to be sure. Its a disturbing film with one of the most dispicable lead characters to come along in some time but its much too long and the pacing is slow. The best part of the film is the lovely female posterior's on display but that doesnt makeup for the tedium of the film that is only allievated by revolting acts of violence depicted in too graphic detail.
1,Horrible disgusting plot. .,This is by far the most disgusting movie I have ever seen. It has no redeeming social value. The plot is sickening. I can't see why an sane peron would make such a movie. If you hate women and like to see brutal sick senseless violence perpetrated against underserving women this is the movie for you. You have to be a psychopath to enjoy this movie.
1,Don't watch it.,This is a well made film with big names in the cast and good acting however this is wasted by the sickening unnecessary violence. I don't understand how anyone could consider watching a woman being beaten to death as entertainment and would be worried about the mentality of someone who does. Some may say that this is bringing the issue of violence against women to light however i think the benefits of this are outweighed by the damage done. There is in my mind no doubt that a tiny percentage of impressionable viewers will be more likely to carry out violent acts having seen this done on screen and even if this resulted in one serious assault then that is enough to justify my criticism of the movie. I did manage to sit through the film to its end but was so sickened by the violence that it went straight into the bin afterwards.. (broke into two pieces just in case someone finds it)
3,Alba could sure take a punch,"The violence was something that is in a lot of films, so that didn't bother me. I didn't particular care for Alba getting her face punched in, but that's just me. Like a few of the others, I thought then ending was simply horrible. I won't spoil it for anyone, but why the hell would they let her get that close in the first place?"
2,the mumblers inside me,This film needs subtitles. The characters do so much mumbling and grousing that it's virtually impossible to determine exactly what their saying.
3,So-so.,"I bought both the LensPen NLP-1 and the LensPen LENSK1 Sensorclear at the same time. Both seem cheaply made and not very strong, but they work okay for now. I have used the Sensorclean once, but I don't think it got all the dust off. I'll keep practicing until I get it right."
1,Do not buy it. Period.,"I have just received mine and as a fool I used it on my 5D Mark ii, now my sensor is dirtier, I used 4 swaps and still need to swap more to clean the dirt that thing left. The Lens Cleaner is nice, but this just does not work."
1,Nearly useless,"The pen is supposedly designed to reach the corners as well as the surfaces of the imaging sensor on digital SLR cameras. It may work just fine on some model cameras with smaller sensors (or larger sensor cavities), but on a Canon 5D it is worthless. The circumference of the pen itself is too large. In order to get close to the corners with the cleaning tip you have to tilt the pen at an extreme angle. This angle causes the flat cleaning surface to not make contact with the sensor. Since the shipping and handling was a large percentage of the total cost, and the item was not very expensive, it's not even worth it to me to deal with sending it back or trying to get a refund. It did seems to work on the parts of the sensor the tip could reach, but the poor shaft design and the inability of the tip to reach the corners makes it a useless item for me."
2,Umm...,"This thing got great reviews from a lot of camera sites I read. I got it for a backup sensor cleaner for travelling, because the only method that really works (sensor swabbing) requires an ultraflammable solvent that will get you tossed into a Navy Brig, solitary, if you tried to take it onto an airplane.When I needed to get rid of a smudge in the field, it seemed to make things much worse at first. A little fiddling and it got a bit better, but I probably would have been far better off just leaving the dust bunny on the sensor. Decent hail mary cleaning solution for the price, just don't expect much, and only use in case of emergency, like if you get a pork chop on your sensor."
1,Disappointing,"The product comes with no written instruction, but instead points you to their website where you find a slow moving video that is as much marketing as instruction and that says, at one point, NOT TO USE THIS BRUSH TO CLEAN THE SENSOR! Now isn't that the very usage it's sold for???"
5,best calendar going,"I love this page a day calendar. I have bought one for the last five years. I have a following in my house. everyday the calendar gives you five things to be happy about. I circle the ones that make me smile and then my daughter highlights the ones that make her smile, then my husband comes along and checks the ones that make him smile. I save the pages and at the end of the year go back and write down all the things that made me smile so on the low days, I pull out my little book of thing to smile about and I can remember and smile again. It is so worth the money for all the smiles it brings and now a family tradition has begun."
2,Not best device in its class,"I suspect most problems people have with rev drives are caused by Iomega's idiotic decision to pretend to be an optical device. This is obviously going to screw with cd/dvd burning software, and doesn't bode well for backup software that isn't best buddies with Iomega. Aside from this, it reads and writes just as good as any other removable hard disk device. For the exorbitant cost and miniscule space, there are better options."
3,"ok, but not all it could be...","looking at the track listing, it looks like any of the millions of 80s compilations out there, with all the same songs. But for a little incentive, they toss in a few 12"" versions. Should have been ALL 12"" versions to make the series even better. Here, the only long versions you get are: running up that hill (5:43), promised you a miracle (6:14), love like blood (6:42) (this is actually the album version), and Love song (6:39) (not the original version--this is a remix)"
3,Careful what you upgrade,"Be careful that you meet the upgrade requirements. I own Adobe Creative Suite CS2, which includes InDesign. I needed to upgrade only InDesign. AFTER buying the product, I found out that a product that includes InDesign is not good enough. This only works with a retail copy of InDesign which is not part of a suite."
3,Not sure if it's worth the money,"I purchased the pony for my 3 year old for her birthday, she wanted to go look at the pony everytime we went to the store and was excited to see it so I decided to buy it for her birthday, I am not sure I would have picked the toy for her myself, I actually think it's quite expensive. She was very excited on her b-day to get the pony and be able to take it out of the box, she played with it the first day or two and then as I assumed didn't really care about it too much. The pony however is very cute, sings and tells you to follow her commands, but like I said to me only worth the money because my little girl was very excited to get him for her b-day and the expression on her face was priceless."
4,Great toy but.... MAJOR battery guzzler,"My 6 year old daughter is crazy about My Little Pony, and this was the only toy on her ""Must Have"" list this year. She enjoys it very much, but she has to compete with my 18 month daughter for her. The baby loves pressing the buttons to make the pony sing, and has even started humming tunes from it, even though she is not talking yet. It's also fallen off the highchair quite a few times and still works. The only problem I have with it is it goes through 4 C batteries about every 4 days! I bought rechargeable batteries and a charger, which cost as much as the pony, but they have saved me tons of money as I am constantly recharging them."
3,Entertaining...for about 5 minutes...,"I bought this for my giftdaughter's 4th birthday and while she desperately wanted this item for the longest time, she only played with it for about a week before she got bored with it. Once you take the item off the ""demo"" mode, it still doesn't do much of anything. Even I thought it was pretty boring! Anyhow, I would spend your money on something better for your children. The animation of the mouth of the Pinkie Pie was pretty cool, though."
5,actually a pretty nice toy,"bought as a christmas gift for 4 year old niece. for a noise making toy, this pony does not get annoying, not too repetitive. entertains for hours. only problem i know is that the exterior stains easily."
5,PinkiePieFansLoveThisEspeciallyIfYou'veBeen2TheShow!,"This is a must fan for a true MLP fan. My 4 year old daughter's room is decorated completely in MLP.We've been to the live stage show twice.What is SO cool about this Singing Dancing Pinkie Pie is that she sings some of the songs from the Live Show! How cool is that?If your child is only marginally interested in MLP (My Little Pony) I don't think I'd spend the money. $49.99 at our Wal-mart. But...for the true fans of MLP-your child should love it. I wish it had more to offer. Like additional cartridges for singing or playing additional games. But...it doesn't and she doesn't mind too much the 'repeatedness' of it.Overall...my kid loves it. BUT...my kid is a HUGE My Little Pony Fan. Again, if your child isn't, I wouldn't spend the money."
3,Great toy - but blocks are a little small & could be unsafe,"My 9 month old son received this toy for Christmas. He loves pulling the string to make the car move which subsequently flashes the lights and starts the music. The blocks that come with the car though are too small. I have always heard the general rule of thumb - if the toy can fit through a toilet paper tube, it can be swallowed. After catching my son choking on the circle block, I tried this test. Two of the blocks failed. I would definitely stick to the recommended age range and watch carefully if you have an older child that puts everything in their mouth."
5,Great Toy,"Some friends gave this toy to our son, he loves it. I like the fact that as he puts the shapes in the correct spot, it says what the shape is. He also, loves to push or pull it around. The headlights blink and make honking noises as he pushes it. I highly recommend this toy."
5,A great toy!,"My daughter received this car for her first birthday. It was the toy she chose to play with over all others at her party, and six months later it is still one of her favorites. She can put all the blocks in the car and say the shapes, but mainly she enjoys running around with the car and scooting around while sitting on it! When she first got it, she enjoyed it as a pull toy more than a shape sorter, but she has grown into it as a shape sorter while still pulling it around. A great toy!"
4,WARNING! SMALL PIECES,"My son received this for his first birthday and loved it, however recently he has begun to put the shapes completely into his mouth. One got stuck and I had to force it out. Just Beware."
3,Dangerous shape size,"My son received this toy as a gift. He likes to pull the car by the string and also likes the music and sounds it makes. But he can also put an entire block into his mouth. This is a big choking hazard if I have ever seen one. All of the blocks are about the same size in diameter. For a one year old I do recommend this toy, but with adult supervision!"
3,Taught 3 courses out of this book,"One of the local colleges in my area uses this book for their beginning algebra course. It's not the worst book I've seen. It does have a lot of nice examples, and a fair number of homework problems. The integration with MyMathLab can be a tremendous asset, or very detrimental. It is quite easy to simply open up all the homework and let the students have their way with it. If used properly, it can really assist in the learning of the material presented in the text.My primary reasons for giving it only 3 stars is because it doesn't do anything that about 50 other algebra books do. Also, the integration with MyMathLab isn't unique. So why pay so much for it? Ultimately, any algebra books written within the past 20 years or so are pretty much the same."
4,Pretty decent math book.,"I had to get this for school. To be honest with you, it is pretty good but a lot of the stuff in the book my teacher still had to completely explain because the book did not make a lot of sense of it."
4,Alegbra Avoided,Three and a half decades ago was my last math course in high school. I thought I had managed to avoid it but here I am 35 years later enjoying it. I think it's the instructor more than the book though.
1,College code needed to do required online work!,"In this book, there is online work that must be done for the class. In the book there is a code to sbmit your work. There was no mention on Amazon or by the seller that the code in the book sold was for a specific College (Wesley I think). We had to pay my daughter's college $82 to get their code! In essence, we had to pay double for this book b/c this was not disclosed!"
1,Right idea poorly executed,"Mr. Morris did wonderful research on technical trading and clearly knows what the charts are about. Morris goes on to clearly discuss that the difference between using technical analysis and using it well is understanding the philosophy of the market, the specific pattern and the interpretation of that, not simply by saying yes this is a buy signal because of the specific pattern but rather because of the physicology behind it and feeling that went with it. He fails to execute what he claims he will do in his introduction. I would save your money and not waste trying to struggle to unearth whatever little advice Morris gives."
5,A Major Support To Nison's Work Based On its Written Style.,An Excellent tool for a handyman's review esp. if u read Nison's work it add's a deeper dimension by adding clarity and simplicity by the systematic way of his writing.... A Pocketbook Special: rated Strong Buy.....
2,An average candlestick book,"If you are looking for a book that defines candlestick formations then this book is for you.If, however, you are a little like me and want that little bit extra than simple definitions, then unfortunately you are going to be disappointed.The only worthwhile part in this book was the 27 pages comprising of chapter 8 - where Gregory Morris combines candlestick formations with sentiment-based indicators.If 90% of the book was devoted to this (the relationship between sentiment-based indicators and candlestick formations) and the other 10% was on the MOST COMMON candlestick formations (rather than candlestick formations that probably only happen once on a blue moon) it would have been a very good book.If you are looking for a good candlestick book I highly recommend ""The Secret of Candlestick Charting"" by Louise Bedford."
4,Good Backup,This is a good book to keep in the laptop case for quick ref.The real books are by Steve Nison. But Morris book is more organized a good value nonetheless
5,ALL YOU`LL NEED,"I have read some negative comments here about this book not being detailed enough etc... but it gives very clear, understandable explanations of all the patterns, and they are all grouped in an excellent orderly easy to find fashion. Other books of this kind may be a bit more detailed but they are a difficult dry read, far too lenthy and not as organized nor as well written. Greg morris delivers all the neccessary goods in this book."
5,Invisible Ink is a must read.,"""Invisible Ink"" by Carl Veno is a must read for anyone who has an interest in the print media and the stories behind the stories. Mr. Veno has written for numerous newspapers and tells interesting and compelling stories from his experiences. He has written for newspapers in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Florida.This is great book for journalism students and people interested in the the newspaper industry. It is also very entertaining."
2,Disappointing,"I purchased this book (in the Kindle edition) hoping to read about earlier times in Olean, NY, where my parents were born. It did contain some interesting reading about Olean and I recognized some of the names mentioned. But that section of the book was annoyingly vague at times. What really disappointed me, though, was the fact that this book is filled with typos (5 in the first 20 pages), and the fact that it reads mostly as an autobiography with a very abrupt ending. If you want to read an interesting immigrant story with higher quality writing, check out ""Oh, Beautiful: An American Family in the 20th Century"". (I have no connection to this title; I just found it a much better read.)"
4,Not best but good.,"this collection ought to have included ""buddy's barmitsfa"" ""the alan brady show presents""[chirstmas show]and the episode where rob thinks he's going bald. for those who remember the show it's a must buy but they could've done a way better job of choosing like the radio tribute show and ""twizzle""."
5,album details,"As the old saying goes,"" Seal has done it again."" The artist known as Seal has put out another steller cd. I can't stop listening to the samples. If you're a fan, this cd won't disappoint you. I'll be the first to get it it's released. Keeping in tune with the previous releases, this cd is a lot more ""clear"" than the last two. The first tune starts and your riding the beat to the last song. As with fine wine, Seal gets better with time. I can see why the time between them is longer than usual. Seal still continues to put out quality music,cd after cd."
3,Disappointed,Much darker than I expected. Not what entertains me. Not anything more I can add that will enlighten a viewer.
3,"Interesting, yet repetitious.","This book makes for an interesting and informative read, if one is looking for a general overview of the history, culture, etc. of Viet Nam. The book has two downfalls. The first being that the number of typos in the book distracts the reader, thus detracting from the enjoyment felt from reading this book. Grrrrr. The second distraction is the sheer redundancy occuring in the book. After the first four chapters, I found myself skipping over the large supererogatory sections that followed. With repetitiveness and misspelling aside, you can feel assured that you will be given a good overview of Viet Nam, its history, culture, and peoples (though the Hill Tribes, or Montagnards, are not given a lot of notice)."
4,Almost a great book,"I think Cole did a good job of role playing into her character but, the story could have been sooo much more and soo better if a little more effort was applied. I personaly really liked it and will recomend it because the voice of Valerie is so real and the pain is real too. I just really wish that cole would have expanded more and made a more bookish novel then leaving it at a diary I think it would have had much more of an impact and meaning. I especially liked the fact that the story took place in my hometown. I really also wish that there were more books out there addressing this subject."
2,Bad Bad Book,"This book is in one word awful. Val is portrayed as an idiot, thinking Peter was gunna marry her as a teenager. Peter is described as nothing more than a pushy sex fiend, well-off loser. Sheila Cole makes the book a cliffhanger; at least in Annie's baby (Beatrice Sparks) we knew what the final decision would be. The book is just terribly unrealistic, and I think that some of todays more impressionable teenage girls would get the wrong idea by reading this book, n then to make matters worse its so bad they probably wouldn't finish it so they wouldn't see how life ends up when the baby's daddy bolts for the exit. Read at your own risk!"
4,Couldn't stay away!,"I read this book about a year ago and the thing about it is that you simply hate to put it down! I mean, it's so real...all the thoughts and actions of this girl (i 4got her name!) are like you're right there with her! I absolutely loved it. If anyone is considering becoming pregnant as a teen then they should really read this book...I highly reccommend it!"
4,Happy Customer,"I am an Amazon Prime customer and ordered this presentation capacitive stylus on 3/25/12 with a delivery date of 3/27/12. Well, I received it today, 3/26/12. Gotta love Amazon Prime. The stylus works flawlessly on my Motorola Zoom and HTC EVO. I'm anxiously waiting the delivery of the New Ipad which is why I bought this in the first place. Because of my job I'm always putting moisturizer on my hands which makes my tablet or phone screens greasy when I use my finger(s). The stylus is the answer I've been looking for. If there is a downside it would be when using the stylus I have to make sure the push buttons for the laser pointer and light are not near my thumb because it's easy to push either of them and be blinded by them. I'm sure in time I'll get use to that though."
3,Dallas: Eleventh Season,"I have all of the Dallas DVDs that have been released thus far, but have been unhappy that several of them have had scratches or something to cause the disc to stop in mid-scene and I would have to stop, eject, find my place and fast forward through it to get to the next part and past the problem. I had one season of Dallas that I returned to Amazon for this reason, they sent me another and it did exactly the same thing. I have had this problem with other seasons as well. Don't get me wrong - I LOVE Dallas, but the quality of these DVDs leave something to be desired."
4,So Where Is Season 12???,I have long since finished season 11...I WANT TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENS NEXT....SO WHERE IS SEASON 12.
4,Glad to have it but some disc issues,"As one who likes to have all the Dallas seasons in my collection, I'm very glad to have this. What I don't understand is that inevitably anymore, there is always one disc here and there that has jumped a little in a scene or pixeled and I say we had better luck back in the day with VHS tapes. These mass produced discs are always a gamble and it's more of a pain to return the whole thing for a replacement on a couple discs where a scene has jumped or is pixeled because the manufacturer lacks quality control on disc checking. When you return many of these items, you find that there's a different disc with the same issue, hence why you just learn to live with the messed up disc or buy a second set! (makes me wonder if that's what is going on to make more money for these manufacturers, etc)"
5,Love Dallas,"Larry Hagman passed away but we can relive the Dallas days with these DVDS. such a great talented cast Larry Hagman, Linda Gray, Barbara Bel Geddes,Patrick Duffy, Howard Keel,Ken Kercheval, Steve Kanaly and many more."
4,Excellent insight into the day to day historical events,"Although the prose is somewhat elongated with lavishly long commentary, the insight is nevertheless extraordianary.This book should be required reading of every literate United States citizen."
5,Good value for the price.,"My husband requested this book so before ordering I did a little research before purchasing. I saw prices ranging from $9.99 to over $100. I wanted a good quality paperback book. The review on this book indicated that ""it was like new, with a slight wrinkle on the cover. The book I received was ""like new"" and the slight wrinkle was not noticeable. I did not pay the lowest price, but the price I spent for this book, was a ""good price for the value"". I received my order on time, and the supplier included a handwritten note, thanking me for my purchase. One last comment, I used my Discover Cashback money to make this purchase and was very please with how smoothly the ordering process went."
4,"Good, if you aren't forced to read it for school.","I have read The Glory and the Dream, and while it was excellently written, I found it hard to concentrate on and retain the information it contains throughout the long time it takes to finish the book (for me, 7 months). It also creates for an impossible time taking a test over it's contents."
3,Good but a liberal bias...,"Quite informative and interesting but Manchester's liberal bias is coming through...at times he is quite objective but at other times his pink ways are showing which is surprising because his bio on SWC was very fair and excellent!Granted, he is no radical leftist but it does get tedious and annoying at times with his liberalism...I just finished his book today....."
1,where is vol. 2,This book come with 2 volumes. I received vol 1 yesterday; may I know when I can received vol 2.
5,Interesting,"If you're looking for a hard-to-put-down narrative history, this is a great one. 'Rates right up there with Shelby Foote's Civil War."
2,Algae Fix,This doesn't seem to be working for me and my pond very well. I am still getting the green algae growing in it.
2,Effective but deadly to fish,This is very effective but also not good for fish despite what the bottle label may claim. They should also have warnings for exact doses or else you risk losing fishes. There is a lot of discussion surrounding this product and one should read up on it before using.Here is a good source:[...]
3,decent but not all that,i brought this exact same item off another website and to be honest it doesnt work like it says it does i wore it for 3 months and didnt notice much difference if anytime more hostility i think they need to do more research on this product
2,Androstenone Pheromone Concentrate for men,Androstenone Pheromone Concentrate for men this product recently i bought the fragrance not favorite the smell not lasting and faded fast.
1,Disappointed,"I like this product and have bee ordering it through Amazon, but this time I was very disappointed; as I received the half sized bottles at a HIGHER price than I had paid for the 10ML bottles, in the past.Seller should post the ML's in the description."
2,what happened?,"I bought one of these sets last fall (2001) and I gave them 5 stars considering the price paid. I bought another set in June 2002 and they are different knives. The blades are different - the serration pattern is a bit different and the new ones do not cut as well as the ones bought last year. Also, the handles are so poorly assembled, with sharp edges, you can easily cut your hand. So, what happened between fall and spring?I will give them 2 stars only because the previous set I bought is great. What you are likely to get now does not deserve any star."
2,Very Disappointing.,"I got these for a Christmas gift for my parents, and I was embarrassed to give them. They came in a wooden block that was shrink-wrapped and included a healty dose of the saw dust that had been removed when the knife slots were routed out. Once we opened them, we found the knives to be mass-production low-quality. Just not what you'd expect for a set of steak knives in this price range. Now... I'm not saying that these were expensive, but what I mean is... they looked like a seven-dollar set of knives."
4,"It cuts the steak, but does it cut the mustard?","The knives are a favorite of mine. The handle fits well in my hand, it cuts beautifully, and it looks georgeous in the table setting. My only problem with it is that the box it comes in should be a good storage unit. It is splintery and difficult to remove the knives from. I do recommend the knives. They're great, but the box doesn't cut the mustard."
4,Very Happy with Item,I am happy with my item that I ordered. My wife is so happy to not have to get of the car to open the gate.
1,Defective product,"Bought this product brand new. Upon attemting to install it on gate system it was found to be defective. It falsed intermittently. That is even when there was no moving metal in range of the sensor it would still trigger intermittently. Because it was beyond the 30 day return period Amazon would not take it back leaving me to try to get warranty with the manufacturer. I hope I have better luck with them then I've had with Amazon. Oh yeah, I acquired a gate mate CP-3 sensor (not from Amazon) instead of the Mighty Mule FM138 and it works perfectly.I wanted to add this to my post: I sent the sensor in to GTO for service. They returned it ""no problem found"". I checked it again and it had the same problem as when I sent it in. I give up. I guess I'm out $140 bucks. My advice is to stay away from this product and this company. The other sensor I mentioned earlier in my review continues to work flawlessly."
3,Useful as a reference to the exam only!,"You should try another book, if you like to get a firm practical knowledge. I would recommend Core Servlets & JSP by Marty Hall.In addition, i find the stylish design of this book irritating."
2,"Too many errors, typos, and inconsistencies","I actually like this book, perhaps a lot. Its physical quality (cover, paper, print, etc.) is good enough. Its approach to teaching is good (lots of charts, tables, diagrams, graphics). And, although I don't know for sure, I have no reason to expect that this book's technical information is other than correct. The problem: 1) typos, 2) grammatical errors, 3) mislabeling and inconsistencies between the text and the code. It's all pretty horrendous, completely unacceptable, not professional at all. Sorry authors, if you want a good review, you must complete the job with a thorough edit of this book. As it stands now, it has potential, but it is not finished.Steve Whitlatch"
1,Get Murach's Book Instead,"Head First Servlets & JSP hardly lends itself as a resource to the working developer. Using JSP and Servlets for the past year, I initially purchased this book to support my primary job task, but was surely disappointed. The scattered and cartoon drawings throughout the book distract the reader from focusing on the core aspects of JSP and Servlets. Moreover, it lends little help for actually getting up and running with JSPs in a working environment. Rather it focuses on how to pass an exam, but even at this endeavor, the book is just too frivolous and distracting. I returned the book immediately and picked up a copy of Murach's JSP and Servlets instead. You will not be disappointed with Murach - he does everything that this book doesn't."
5,Fantastic,"There are already so many good reviews about this book. However, I would say that this book is so beautifully writen that you wouldn't want to stop reading it. So go for it, you will not regret buying it."
3,Not Enough End-to-End Examples,"This book has its strong points and weakness. It explains certain concepts really well. However it did not have much end-to-end exercise for people to practice. Only 1 end-to-end example in the entire book as I recall. Therefore, it is hard to sink in what you have read. Especially, jsp and servlets need to have multiple pieces put together in order to make the application run. The example does not need to be complehansive, but will help the readers to put all the pieces together. If you are looking for examples to guide you through, then this book is not for you."
2,Too much fluff,"I returned it to Amazon. Thanks but No Thanks.Certainly, a little humor is always appreciated in a tech book. But this book just seems to take the concept a little too far. The 886 pages could have easily fit into 400 or 500 (and still would have space for some comic relief here and there!).If you've got a few spare months on your hands with which to study for the scwcd exam and want to enjoy yourself along the way, then this book is for you. If you want to pass the exam and still enjoy an interesting read, I would recommend the scwcd book published by Manning. (Although admittedly, I've only seen the first edition)."
4,Great study book with its own style,This book is very well set up though you must appreciate its particular style of writing. The style contains a lot of informal notes and graphics that are funny and help you in the study process. The authors definitely know their stuff and I am confident that I will be able to pass the SCWCD exam using this book.
4,Decent SCWCD book,"This is a decent book for passing SCWCD. The mock exams are much harder than the actual SCWCD exam. So, if you pass the mock exam, you should be in very good shape. There are a couple of typos here and there. In general though, it's a decent book."
3,It's OK,"The subtitle of the book is ""Passing the Sun certified Web Component Developer Exam"" and it would be helpful for that. The real issue is that, like all exam prep books, this book doesn't help much with creating real world applications or go into tremendous depth. I would only recommend this book to those that want to study for the aforementioned exam, but not for those who want to really learn JSP and servlets."
3,The basics of Java web development,"Apart from reviewing the servlet/JSP standard APIs, this book teaches how to build web applications using the Model-View-Controller design pattern in Java. In MVC, a servlet (controller) receives user requests, calls the application logic (model) and dispatches the result to the proper JSP (view). It also addresses common issues in web application development, from deployment to security.Before being able to develop professional web applications, which typically involve the use of frameworks such as Struts or Tapestry, you must get acquainted with their foundations: servlets and Java Server Pages (JSP). That's what you can learn from ""Head First Servlets & JSP"".Despite its relatively low signal-to-noise ratio (a typical feature of the ""Head First"" series) and its lack of more advanced design considerations, this engaging book might still be a good starting point for those interested in Java web development."
5,Nice buy!,"Even though the book was used, it was in a very nice shape. No torn or bent pages and no markings. Just as the seller said. I am very happy with my purchase. Thanks!"
4,nice read,"From the introduction it seems to be reading a kind of ""Make a million dollar in one week"" book.I've found the Head First style really funny and attractive.For a newbie the book can be a really good introduction and the style help so much, but If you are an expert developer don't take the book as a complete Servlets or JSP guide. It's a nice riassunto for everyone that need to refresh their acknowledge but It don't cover the entire process of a real world work. Pretty usefull too for passing the SCWCD exam."
2,Good for exam. Bad for learning,"Another reviewer mentioned that this book teaches what's on the exam and nothing more, and I have to agree. After going through the book, I feel like I could pass the exam, but I still don't really know how to put together a functioning web app.The book starts promisingly with a sample web app and it frequently refers back to it, but never really brings it all together to show a finished working product.I should say that I'm not interested in taking the exam. I bought the book to learn about setting up a web app on my own. This is merely a study guide in my mind, and not useful for my purpose."
5,The only book need to pass the SCWCD Exam,"I know some may find the style of this book annoying but I loved it. There is lots of repetition to drive points home and the mock exams are well written. There is humor so you don't wake up with drool marks obscuring the most important/boring topic in the book. And finally, just by reading this book and reviewing the DTDs for tomcat's web.xml I was able to pass the SCWCD with flying colors."
4,Comprehensive reference for the subject material,"I've not taken the exam, but this book clearly covers much more than exam objective material. This is both good and bad.Good, because I'll refer to the book for quite a bit in the future.Bad, because I'm lazy and filling my brain with valuable material that's not necessarily relevant to the exam.Overall the book is well written, organized and enjoyable to read."
3,Not my style,"This book is cute but they went too far. Its a bit silly and inefficient. I tried reading a few chapters and sent it back. Its also much bulkier than it should be; there's a lot of wasted space. However if you like this type of book, give it a try. I'm sure it is accurate and that is certainly a plus!"
3,ONLY for the exam. It is useless after the exam,"The book may be good for the exam, because the authors are the exam creators. However, the book is not good to help us learning Servlet and JSP model. The examples in the book are really poor since they cannot inspire you to think in JSP or Servlet."
4,easy read,One of the best series in educational technology books. It's an easy reed and a book with a sense of humor!
3,Great book for a narrow audience,"I found this book to have way too much fluff. Certain concepts that are easily understood were given too many pages, which made the reading a chore. I felt like I was forced to read all of the zany sidebars on each page in order to get the information I needed. This book is massive, and serves better as exercise equipment given that the mass is entirely the result of large fonts and graphics. Experienced developers should stay clear of this title."
3,Pickel Ball Paddle,For Picle tournaments and leagues a better one is needed-otherwise it is fine for recreational play at a non competitive level.
2,Fulfills a Purpose,"Painted Plywood, small head, wouldn't bother, go Composite - wish they were available through amazon."
1,UPSET,THIS PADDLE IS TERRIBLE WANT TO SEND BACK VERY HEAVY AND DOES NOT LOOK LIKE PICTURE I WOULD ADVISE TO STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT WE ARE JUST LEARNING THE GAME AND WAY TO HEAVY FOR A WOMEN
1,pickleball baddle,This was NOT the product I ordered. What I received was not what was pictured online. I call this false advertising. The picture on the package also was not the paddle that was inside. I intend to return it and it annoys me that I have to pay postage.
5,Excellent Book,"Tired of your kids playing video games? Buy this book.Easy to follow, my 10 and 14 year olds are using this book and having a great time. It is has step by step instructions. They are having fun designing and creating their own game.No prior experience necessary.I hope that more books like this are in the works."
4,Very pleased with teh performance,"I have used this to clean spots on carpets, clean wood floors, marble floors and complete sanitation of the bathrooms and showers. I have been very pleased with its performance. All of the different attachments make the work even more effective. The one issue I have is the pressure control feature doesnt seem to be very reliable. It will lose pressure to below 2 after a few minutes of using. I have not been able to get the pressure beyond 4 even when I turn the control all of the way up. It is a very simple machine to operate which is great but the pressure control issue is the only concern I have. I'm very happy with the cleaning power it has."
3,advertised price too high,"I bought this steamer and it works. However, I bought it on sale for $499 new. It is worth $500 and I consider the purchase a good value at that price. However, it is not worth the $700-$800 price that I see it advertised for. You might as well buy a Ladybug steamer if you're going to spend that much."
3,Tank may rust out?,"A year+ after buying my steamer, I had left it idle about six months. I had maid service, and so had no use for it at the time.We recently emptied the tank (it had maybe a half tank during the time it was unused), and the water came out brown, looking like rust.The water tank is iron? Steel? Really? In the age of aluminum?Be careful to empty it every time, I guess, or it may go bad on you. I have no idea at this point how long my steamer will stay in working condition, but this is a worrying sign. Will update as I learn more."
1,Milady's Guide to Lymph Drainage,Not at all for lymphedema patients but otherwise a good view of lymph drainage for peoplele with less compromised or healthy lymph systems.
4,A helpful book.,"This book was included in a Lymphatic drainage massage, continuing education program I took. I am a massage therapist by the way. The book is written in laymans terms and easy to understand. Thorough as to contraindications and indications for lymphatic massage, which is different from manual lymphatic drainage. This book was not intended to address the severity of lymphadema.A comination of the book and the video by Sean Riehl would be the best purchase. Although there is no substitute for hands on training when it comes to lymphatic massage/drainage.I would recommend this book to people that already have an understanding of lymph massage and minimal hands on experience."
3,review,I found this book very american. It skimmed the theory and dangerously avoided dangers of treating non healthy clients.I found the instructions confusing and unhelpful. I would not recommend this book.
1,pcv valve,"I used the Amazon decision tree to get at the right product. It led me through year, make, model,engine, etc. It definitely said that this pcv valve fit my engine. It definitely does not. It takes a right angle valve to fit properly. Since I thought I had a perfect fit, I waited a few months before attempting to install, my bad. I do not expect a return/refund on such a low priced (but wrong) part."
4,Love'em,"Love these knives. Unfortunately, one of the handles broke, and I have not been able to find where to send them for repair. I am pretty sure it's lifetime warranty."
4,"Pull up some survey stakes, drink a beer, and read this book","Zakin spins an entertaining story of the rise and ultimate fall from grace of one of the most influential environmental organizations of our time. The book emphasis is clearly on Foreman and his cronies and their hard-drinking, take-no-prisoner stand on protecting wilderness. If you're interested in a detailed look inside the personalities that created and shaped Earth First!, then this is your book."
2,Not the same quality as earlier sets!,"I purchased this item from Amazon back in 2001 and was thrilled with the quality and value of the knives. They were by far the best set I have ever owned.Flash forward to 2003, and I repurchased the set through Amazon after the originals were lost in a fire. The new set came in different packaging and is noticeably inferior in quality. The steel isn't as thick or as durable, the blades are dull and poorly finished, and the handles have a cheaper feel and look to them. I've already noticed rust and discoloration on two of the knives even though I've always hand washed them. This never happened with the earler set.I'm inclined to believe that these are seconds or knockoffs, even though they carry the Sabatier ""Made in France"" inscription on the blades. My advice: stay away, or purchase from somewhere where you can see and feel the knives before buying."
2,Terribly Boring,"Terrible translation from French, terribly boring. Hard to explain, it isn't exactly a history book, is it? Not written like one. Like listening to a very boring lecture on the economics or ancient France. Not what I expected."
5,sexy & suggestive,1 it's so hard 2 out of my mind 3 i want & need you 4 let's take it slow 5 how to make it right 6 latest greatest inspiration 7 if i could would you 8 dreams come dreams go 9 i like it like this 10 smooth [shout out] 11 dreams come dreams go [acapella] 12 let's take it slow [acapella]
3,HOKEY!,"This has got to be the most HOKEY DVD I've ever seen! It is soooo poorly put together it's ridiculous. I could have filmed this and edited this in my basement. The guy in the video is soooo corny and totally creepy and the woman looks like shes on her deathbed in the sequences that she has the gown on. The menus have NO continuity, and they speed through the hard parts and take forever on the easy parts. The most valuable part of the DVD is just watching the sequences and doing what they do. Did I learn to dance for my wedding...yes...but the above reviews must be paid by the makers of this DVD because there is NO WAY anyone would rate this DVD 4 or 5 stars."
5,great for two left feet!,"This is a terrific video for those who feel they cannot dance. My husband has been told to stay away from the dance floor all his life, but thanks to this video both of us can really get up and dance. The video begins with how to stand and hold each other and how to relax. It's that basic. The next lesson is a step by step demonstration of some basic steps. Then the couple show how to add to those steps with some turns and what to do with a faster beat. The whole learning process is clearly presented. We learned by using the pause button and slow motion for just a few minutes each night. The video gives music suggestions and a little history for extra tidbits of information. This video is advertised for a wedding dance but it is perfect for beginners. If you think you cannot dance give this video a try."
3,Martians Are Back,"Like the first book in this series Gordan Korman incorporates a very good sense of humor into this book. This book is about some kids from ""Mars"" who form a hockey team, so if you like hockey this is a good book to read. I would reccomend this book to kids about Grade 3/4 because it is quite an easy read.By: Hafiz Dhanani"
2,Poor quality,"If you were raised in the school of the Barclays and Vines, then skip this book and the series. This in no way compares to those masterly books which dissect words in the Bible with such dept providing information for you to meditate and chew on. Rather this book and others in the word study series lack dept, they give metrics such as how many times the word appeared in the various books of the bible but i don't see a knowledge of the greek or hebrew culture or environment which will give me more inside into why that word was chosen by the writer. God will use the imagery associated with the various words in the writer's mind to convey the thoughts in his mind. I expect word books to provide that kind of data, i did not get it with these word study books."
5,"Classic ""Man vs. Wild.""","Robert Redford plays a man running from a world where governments decide wars and make men die in them, into a world where men decide for themselves how to live and die. Great movie. One of Redford's best. Highly recommended."
4,well done,off beat but i think it covered the lives and the problems of that periodl. time passage could have been a bit better.
4,Must See Western,"If you're into western movies, this is a must see. My family &I I use quotes from this movie all the time. Redford is a great actor & performs his part well."
4,Great movie,This is one of the greatest movies of all time and I have watched it many times and will keep it in my movie collection.
2,slow and depressing,"A film that was lauded by my father many times in the early 70's when I was a small boy under the age of 10. I think it fed into his vision of himself as a wanna be mountain man. But it was traumatic viewing to a little boy and maybe that is why I don't like it much now as a middle age man. To me it makes the mountains seem like a very lonely and sad place to be. I think this Jeremiah Johnson, though mostly legend, was not a hero but a lonely loser. Although filmed well, I hope I don't have to watch this again. Not the great movie that some label it as being."
1,"There are now exactly 4,000,000 Sabbath compliations",Far too little Sabbath compilations out there. I think there should be at least 2 dozen Sabbath compliations for every 1 human being on the planet. And they should all be with Tony Martin.Stop the madness. What the hell? Please I'm begging you! I'll pay to not have any more Sab compilations!!! Stop now!!!
1,"Don't buy, they don't stay put","My sons and I tried these in two different sizes and were, uh, sorely disappointed. Unlike the thicker Spenco insoles, these have a very slick bottom and simply don't stay put in shoes or sneakers. At first we noticed this playing basketball but then it became clear that they move around and curl up even as a result of walking. You can just feel the blisters forming. We're going to try gluing these insoles in, but of course that will make them impossible to remove for use in other footwear. Even gluing them will be tricky, because inserting them involves all kinds of folding and shoving and so forth. An absolutely dismal product, to be avoided at all costs."
1,Need an expert to adjust this one,"I bought these orthodics thinking that they were the type you put in the oven to heat upp and then simply put in your shoe and step on to mold to your foot. I was wrong. You CANNOT put these in the oven - they have rubber backing that will burn. They recommend using a heat gun and a TRAINED specialist to help mold these to your feet.Stick with the other brands that require an oven - or get a real orthodic. Forget about this one. I cant see heating it up with a hot heat gun and thenmolding it by hand. They really must be kidding. Even with a glove, you cant do it yourself - exprt help will cost several times the cost of this product."
2,review,"nice little toy for casing ducks around the take we have down the road.Down side, the battery only last about 15 -20 minutes tops.Better buy was the Smasher Destoryer, little bit more but was faster and battery lasted for 45 minutes..... http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002G4TN5Q/ref=s9_simp_gw_s0_p21_t4?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf;_rd_s=center-2&pf;_rd_r=0FAFQ0G4CW8EWSDTJH67&pf;_rd_t=101&pf;_rd_p=470938631&pf;_rd_i=507846"
2,Waste of my money,"when i first used this boat, it was great! after a few runs the length of each charge of the battery seemed to get shorter. then all the accessories on the boat started to break off. Now the little light has snapped off...I'm buying a new boat now because it is beyond repair...I wouldn't recommend this..."
4,Sterling Knight is A Real Star in This Movie,Actor Sterling Knight stars in this movie playing a singer named Christopher Wilde who meets a girl who doesn't like him until she gets to know him.Her sister is a fan of him.The reason she doesn't like him at the begining is because all she hears about is him because her sister keeps mentioning him in almost every sentence.It is not until she meets him herself that she realizes he is not what she read about him that he is a good young man who is in show biz.Sterling Knight brings something into the role that makes the movie good.Sterling Knight should do more movies like this.He is a Great in light comedy and sings good in this movie.
4,Very Fun movie.,I am very glad I purchased this movie. It was packaged very well and I am very pleased on how fast I received it.
1,Laughing to the Bank,"The question is, ""Are they Disney executives I hear laughing to the bank as they create truck loads of lemming mindless superficiality to further the intelligence decline of American society or are they simply laughing to the bank as they simply reinforce what trends already exists in American society?"""
1,DO NOT BUY !,"These knives are junk. Seriously. Cheap plastic handles, a rivet job that looks as though someone nailed the knife together with tacks. Bent or crooked blades (depending on which knife you look at) complete with missing or maybe ground off points.Unbelievable! ($$$) ? I don't think so."
4,Worth the money,"I bought these knives through another source and while they certainly aren't ""Wusthof quality"", they are durable and very sharp. They are serrated and that is not my preference. However, my Chef's Choice sharpener keeps them razor sharp. I would not put them in a dishwasher - as is true of all my knives. A good value - in my opinion."
1,Junk of the worst order,This is the worst quaility cutlery Ive seen since my first dime store knife. The quality atrocious: plastic and white metal don't think twice keep your money in your pocket...
2,small,this item was too small and the color is off. it can be for a very small room or maybe a pc desk
4,Good,I loved it but on the second day the shade fell off.. :( Trying to get it stick back but other than that its great.
4,ORE Burgundy Lamp,"Very nice lamp, for the price. Cute, elegant, and puts off just enough light. I would recommend this product. Easy to assemble."
5,Adorable!,"This small lamp is very pretty and it looks great on my small bedside table. The burgundy shade softens the light, which is just what I expected it would do."
3,Wobble wobble,"Cute little lamp, creates a nice evening glow for a bedroom. Not very sturdy, it shattered as soon as I threw it on the ground! No, but seriously, it's very off-kilter so don't let your cat (or kid) anywhere near it. It's about as stable as I am emotionally. ;]"
2,This is only a 40 watt lamp,"The product description states that this takes standard 60 W bulbs, but the lamp says it just uses 40 W, so I'm forced to return it.The only reason I'm giving it two stars instead of one is that it's an attractive lamp for the price. I'd keep it if I needed a 40 W lamp"
3,More Red than Purple,"I suppose I should have read more closely. It is labeled as Burgundy, but looks fairly purple in the picture. The lamp I received is definitely more in the maroon-burgundy family. I still like it so far. I think I'll stick with it and see how I feel rather than go through the pain of returning it. Maybe the color will grow on me."
4,Excellent introductory text,"This book could have also been titled ""Econometrics for Dummies"". Koop explains the basics of econometrics remarkably well without having to resort to complicated mathematical formulae or convoluted explanations. For neophytes looking to learn the basics of linear regression, multiple regression and time series analysis this is the perfect the text. Anyone requiring a treatment of more advanced topics (heteroscedasticity, censored regression, weighted least squares and so forth) should look to a different text. However, for any beginners to econometrics I would recommend this as a very readable and understandable introduction."
5,eBook option is great!,I'm so glad eBook options are starting to be available for textbooks. It beats carrying heavy books around and increases the chances of having it near me when I'm in a reading mood.
1,Glaring Omission of Answers,"I have given only 1 star because the book does not give the answers to the many exercises and questions. The book is aimed at beginners. Is the beginner supposed to assume he got the answers right?I agree with the other reviewers that Koop explains the statistical concepts in simple, easy-to-understand terms but I really don't think there is any excuse for omitting an appendix with the answers to questions."
5,They do what they're supposed to,"Not much to say about these tees. They just plain work.They're long enough that I can tee the ball up high for my large driver head, sturdy enough that they don't break every time I hit off them, and a nice price to top it off."
5,Golf Tees at a great price,"They are golf tees; what can I say? They do what they're supposed to do. I prefer 2-3/4 inch variety, and these fit the bill, were inexpensive, and are of good quality. I'll buy them again in the future. INTECH seems to make pretty quality, low cost golf items, like theirIntech Beta Ti EXD Golf Ballswhich I also own and have good experiences with. If you want to golf without losing your shirt on overpriced equipment, I think they're a good brand."
2,terribly fragile,"these things break every single time you tee off. i played a round with these and needed 14 of them.they are dirt cheap, but it's a real hassle to carry so many tees with you.i definitely recommend getting some plastic ones instead."
5,Wow! Who knew the Difference in Natural Tees?,"I can't believe how much better these tees are compared to other 2-3/4"" unnatural tees. You can really feel the nature every time you tee one up."
4,Almost great product,This is a good mit with a nice leather feel. The only problem I am having with it is it does not stay on yuor hand very well unless you pull the velcro strap lock very tight. The other issue might be a manufactoring defect but the laces that connect the top of the glove on the fingers was not pulled together very tight and I had to do it my self. They are still not very tight and I am hoping that this will not be an issue later down the road.
2,What a mess,"Very cute front cover but when you open it up to put photos in it, the clear plastic wrinkles very easily. Most of them are already wrinkled which makes viewing photos difficult and detracts from the picture. Would definately NOT recommend"
1,"Came damaged, twice","I really thought this was a cute item when I saw it on Amazon, but it came damaged the first time (the spine was detached (unglued) from the album, so I sent it back and asked for a replacement. The second time it came, it was damaged the same exact way, so I returned it and gave up ordering it. Too bad, it was a really adorable album."
3,FUGITIVES OF THE FOREST,"I have just read this remarkable story. While the author's arguments are slightly flawed and narrow in scope, He has recorded, for history, the many brave acts performed by a group of people who refused to just give up."
5,Great Children's Story,This is a great children's book with an introduction to Spanish and the Spanish culture. The illustrations are just delightful and thoughtfully done. The pictures and story will keep little ones entertained. The children and animals are so cute. Your children will just love all the animals and their costumes for the parade and blessing by the padre. This book will make a great gift for your children or grandchildren. A must buy for anyone with children.
5,Los Amiguitos' Fiesta,"What an enchanting story, what beautiful illustrations, what a wonderful book! It's a great way to have fun with your children and introduce them to Sapnish at the same time! It delighted me from cover to cover and I look forward to the day when I can read it to my own children, over and over again!!"
4,More than I expected.,"When I read in the description that this card holder had 6 pockets, I did not expect that it would be in addition to the 2 pockets that it already had. The outside is colorful and 3D without over-doing the design, and overall it's quite sturdy for being made out of vinyl-- there has been little stretching and no tearing. The only problem I have with this product is that the insert likes to creep out, and that can be a bit of a pain, since the holder has no clasp. Still, it's more than I expected for being a brightly colored vinyl wallet! :)"
4,sabatier- the beauty and the room for improvement,"Sabatier's provence line is everything I look for in a knife. Wood handles, clean lines, and high carbon. Emblematic of french quality by means of its hand ground finish and sturdy yet elegant brass riveted handle-the block set still falls short. The biggest disapointment comes from the block itself, roughly cut in taiwan with uneven holes and glaring second rate quality. The knives are less appreciable in such a frame. The set also feels incomplete from the many vacant knife holes in the block. Perhaps this is good marketing, it certainly had me pricing the steak knife set. Nevertheless, the Sabatier knife set is a beautiful and functional grouping of knives, with the bread knife a particular stand out. The craftmanship is rough in a couple of spots, but i consider this the warmth of hand produced materials. Overall a wonderful set that most often shines, and other times leaves a bit desired."
1,Maybe if I had gotten them....,"I can't really review them because I ordered them at a very low price, and although the page said ships in 2-3 days, I waited and waited and waited, and was finally informed that they were out of stock, and my order was cancelled. Of course, they are still advertising them with the 2-3 day ship date, and graciously suggested that I reorder (at 100 bucks plus shipping more)."
1,Don't waste your money.,"Our family is planning a trip to the Islands so I decided it would be nice to have a guide written specifically for families. Well don't waste your money on this one. I think this is the worst guide I've ever owned. I expected details, descriptions, recommendations. Mostly what I got was a list of hotels or activities containing addresses and websites. If your looking for a family friendly guide, try Frommer's Hawaii with kids. Now thats a guide."
3,Ok-ish,"It does the job its designed to do as well as any other similar product,. however, some of them in this price range store there extra parts in a chamber at the other end of the ""pen"" tube, in retrospect I should have gone with one of those models as iv already lost two of the extra tiny suction cups. On a plus note I use this for soldering small SMD circuit boards, and so far the suction cups seem to be semi melt proof,. I'm sure if I really tried,. But so far with normal use, No melting of the suction cups (that i can still find)."
2,Doesn't work well for ICs,"I bought this hoping that it would be a cheap vacuum tool for handling small electronic chips for surface mount soldering. Unfortunately suction is lost within a few seconds of grabbing chips so this tool can't work for what I wanted to use it for. As another reviewer mentioned the problem is that the plastic tip covers really don't make a good seal, so suction is temporary at best."
1,Extremely disappointing,"I wasn't asking for much.All I wanted was to able to lift a single 1 - 2mm rhinestone up from a little dish, move it a couple of inches, and place it onto a jewelry setting filled with epoxy clay.This item was unable to produce even the small amount of suction I needed for this purpose. It was barely able to lift a rhinestone out of the dish, period. Most of the time, it couldn't even create a seal. On the rare occasion it picked anything up at all, it may very well have been because the stone was stuck to the silicone. It certainly wasn't capable of anything resembling precision placement.I can't in good conscience recommend this tool for hobby use. It was not useful."
4,Excellent reeds,"Great product - These reeds are excellent stiffness for an intermediate player. It is worth getting the box of 10, because if you really play you will go through reed... Would highly recommend these."
4,One of Canada's most under-rated songwriters,"I discovered Jimmy Rankin earlier this year. I saw a video of his on TV and picked up his first CD on a whim and it has barely left my stereo since then. There is something quite fine about this musician and his songwriting...If you are thinking The Rankins, don't. This is way beyond that. Mind you, so far I have liked his first CD more than the second, but the haunting 'Colorado' is as fine a song as you will ever hear."
3,Look Out For Lippy!,"This film was a bit above the standard genre fare being released at the time. I remember going to see it after reading the book and it really freaked me out. Towards the end, when all the ""poor souls from hell"" appear, they actually used some disfigured people (saving money on fx make-up?). There was this man from Coney Island, we used to call him ""Lippy,"" that scared the hell outta me when I was a kid (in the 60's). He was probably a nice man, but I after the 1st time I saw him I had nightmares for months. I did a double take when I saw him in this movie... it was incredible to have one of your childhood fears realized like that... got me again dude (lol). So look for Lippy at the end of the film...ya can't miss him ; )"
2,"Great Movie, Poor DVD Transfer","This film will give you goose bumps from start to finish. I've watched it several times and it still scares the ""heck"" out of me! The combination of a good script, eerie music, and great acting made for a great shocker horror film. And for such a relatively unknown film, what a great cast!Unfortunately, GoodTimes has done their typically tragic job on the production of this DVD. For starters, the film is not presented in widescreen format. There's enough tape hiss and jitter to make one wonder if they used a VHS tape as the master! And there are only two ""extras"" - a trailer that looks like it was transferred from a camcorder and the shortest (2 page) ""production notes"" I've ever seen. Not surprisingly, the close-captioning is extremely poor, too.Sadly, if you want to add this movie to your personal collection, this DVD is all that's currently available. Please, Universal, release a DVD that does justice to this movie!"
5,The gateway between realms,"I saw this movie as a kid and had to buy the DVD as an adult. For one thing, it has a great cast. I also love the whole concept of a secret division of the Catholic Church whose job it is to guard the entrance between our world and Hell. Burgess Meredith was outstanding as the charming, seemingly harmless, seemingly benevolent, cat-loving neighbor. Beverly d'Angelo and Sylvia Miles as the pervy, eccentric lesbians were fantastic! The setting reminded me of Rosemary's Baby. This is one of my favorite horror films! Very creepy and super entertaining!"
4,A THRILLER DVD WORTH THE PURCHASE.,"I SAW THIS MOVIE BACK IN THE 70's AND EVENTHOUGH THE PLOT STARTS OFF SLOWLY,THE MOVIE KEEPS YOU INTERESTED UNTIL THE END. THIS IS WHEN EVERYTHING COMES TOGETHER AND THE HORROR IS UNLEASHED.BURGESS MERIDETH GIVES AN EXCELLENT PERFORMANCE AS USUAL.THE HORROR AT THE END OF THE MOVIE IS WORTH WAITING FOR."
2,deception!!!,"not as good than i thought!!! the story could be better!! a lot of clichés! very annoying, not much to say either!!!"
3,The Book is Always Better,"I just recently read the book. I'd never seen the movie, so it was a surprise. It's not really a Horror novel so much as perhaps a supernatural mystery. The movie was decent and it gave the chance to see the ending horror."
2,Wait Until it's $6.99 or Less,"Not too many films scare me. I may get startled, but not scared; except for movies about religion and the supernatural. I had high expectations. Aside from watching Ava Gardner and a younger Beverly D'Angelo, it wasn't entertaining, scary, or even worth the sale price of $6.99."
4,"""ONE OF THE SCARIEST FILMS OF ALL-TIME""!","Watching this as a boy, of only ten years of age, scared me beyond belief. Upon watching it ~ yet again as an adult ~ I find the film has lost none of it's original vigor. (*SPOILER ALERT*) In regards to the film's finale, most will call it an unhappy ending. I, on the other hand, see the it as extremely possitive. The model ~ now a nun who's the newset ""gate-keeper of hell"" ~ will now find salvation in her death. And after getting a glimpse of what the alternative had to offer her, I'd most certainly call that a happy ending. In any event, I'd call ""The Sentinal"" a brilliant film of horror and suspense. However, I would not reccomend it for young children or the faint of heart."
4,fantastic and very disturbing film,"This is definetely the epitome of 70's horror. Most of which is very direct and in-your-face. Sure to be a hit at any sleepover, it's a must for any horror fan's collection!"
3,A Shameless Ripoff of The Exorcist,"The title says it all, and it is evident from the first frame: the graphics, the exotic old-world location of a supernatural/demonic revelation; the protagonist not a movie actress but a fashion model; the orchestral score including the shocking discordant violins.Still, even though the premise is silly Manicheism, the haunted house crap is chilling and Burgess Meredith is quite creepy. The special effects are good."
1,The Sentinel,"I believe people are being too kind for the film,The Sentinel had potential but a slow paced and even at times comical storyline.Burgess Meredith(Rocky)Is great,Ava Gardner's last film appearance,but I think the makers were too busy trying to shock and went down the tubes(no Pun)to distaste.Not to mention That as usual of the era the slanted anticatholic prejudice,I have yet to see a horror movie with an antiprotestant slant,if anyone knows please advise,there is two sides.One between good and evil and yet by the same token to imply a secret group of priests are covering up.As usual it is more easy to pick on The Church than say Judaism or Islam.However,even if you were to take out the bias you still have a movie that plain and simple tanks and in no way can compare to The Omen.It's really too bad the story was unique from the other occult films."
1,The Sentinel Absolutely A Waste of Time,"I recall seeing this movie edited for TV in the 1980s and had remembered it was ""scary"". I recently purchased this and watched it; I must have been out of my mind. The acting is absolutely terrible, and I found the movie ridiculous, offensive (it wasn't just the acting that was offensive...), and a total waste of time. I fast forwarded through much of it and couldn't even finish it. It went right into the garbage. Don't waste your time on this one...If you are looking for a scary ghost story from a similar era, try The Changling with George C Scott. Now THAT is a ghost story worth watching..."
2,A major problem,"It's difficult for me to do a review because I couldn't play the DVD on my player because I am in Region 2 and the DVD is in Region 1 format. I have now realised I can get the film on VHS tape, where I will be better placed to do a review. I saw this film back in the 70s and I remember, at the time, it scared me sh**less. That's why I'm keen to acquire it now."
1,really good cast....very bad flick,"This movie was sooo bad, my girlfriend and I couldn't wait for it to end. Sure the cast is good, Beverly D'angelo's performance stands out in my mind, but apart from that, this film is plain awful. I'm sorry that I shelled out 11 clams including delivery for this wreck of a movie. If I could give it less than 1 star I would."
2,Not their usual quality,"Having been impressed with the quality of many other Little Tikes products that I have purchased, I was disappointed with the Roadster Toddler bed. When my son tied to put it together, he found the holes were not in the proper place for assembly. Luckily he is quite handy, so he drilled new holes and was able to put the bed together. While this was a solution, I am disatified with the quality of the product. I expected quality control to assure a product that could be properly and easily assembled."
4,HELP,Just got this cute little bed today- how the heck do you get the wheels on??? there were no screws or anything in the box... HLEP
1,The bed is in such bad shape it won't go together properly.,"We bought this bed for my sons birthday and after trying for hours to get this bed together so that it would be safe for him to sleep in, my husband and I were unsuccessful. The bed was manufactured poorly and now my son will not be getting his car bed on his birthday. What a shame! I hope others don't have to experience the same disappointment....."
5,Great Bed,"We bought this bed for my son who is now 12 and we just put my 2 year old in it. He is the 4th child to use it and it is still in excellent condition. I highly recommend this to any parent who isn't sure about putting your child into a bed yet. We found they can't wait to go to bed and stay in it.TJ's Mom - Fisher Price makes a toddler size bed rail, it is blue and white so it matches the bed."
4,Adorable and Fun!,"I really liked this bed but I read alot of bad reviews so it made me sceptical. Once I bought it and we put it together, my son(23months) had never been more excited about his new bed. We needed to get him a new bed because we have a new baby coming in January 2005 and we needed to get him out of the crib. He has adjusted really well to his bed and sleeps all night long in his own room! We did need to buy a bunkie board which was about 19.99 but his mattress sits right in it with no gaps on the sides. I love this bed its adorable, I definitly recommend this bed for new toddlers!"
5,Mattress Support,"I actually don't own this bed, but I was checking something for work and came across these reviews. (I work at Toys R Us). For all of you talking about how ""there's no mattress support""... you should just buy one instead of using cardboard boxes and such. (Which is probably not that safe.) No, it doesn't come with a support, and they should tell you this when you buy it or it should at least come with one since it is one of the more expensive beds. But anyway... you can buy one from this website, or at a TRU store... it's called a ""bunkie board""."
4,Little Tikes Roadster Toddler Bed-Blue,Really cute bed for my 2 year old. The convertable crib/toddler bed that he and his older brother used had just had it so my husband and I bought this for him. The only thing I don't like about it is the mattress doesn't sit very low in the frame so it's kinda easy for him to role on out of. I stuck some extra pillows on the sides just in case. At least it's really low to the floor..
5,This Little Tikes Roadster Toddler Bed is great.,"My son just received this bed for his 3rd Birthday. He loves it. The problem that everyone else has encountered is the spacing around the mattress. My husband and I got a big cardboard box, flattened it down and placed it on the springs then put the mattress on it. This way my son's arms or legs can't get caught in the springs. My son likes to jump on his bed so the cardboard was one way to ease our minds about him getting caught in the sides of the bed."
5,Love this Car Bed,I have bought four of these beds for various family members. I am about to buy another this one for my second grandchild. My first grandchild loves his and hopefully my second will love his. The look they give when they see the car bed is priceless.
1,Rip Off,"I bought this identical bed at Toys R Us for $175.00. This person is ripping people off, do your shopping before paying their mark up and shipping costs."
4,Two minor flaws,"My husband and I bought this bed for our son for his first birthday. He had no problems getting used to it (we kept it in his room for a couple of months until he got out of his crib). My only complaints are (and the first seems to be addressed by EVERYONE!!) that there isn't any kind of support that comes standard with the bed, and second - there's about a 2 inch gap between the mattress and sides all the way around the car. This is a pain for my son, because if the mattress slides all the way to one side, he can stick his hands down next to the springs from his crib (used for the support piece). We now use his old crib bumper and just squish it down into the gaps. It's a bit of a pain, but I think it's worth it - my son LOVES this bed!"
5,Such a nice little bed,"I got this for my one year old son. He loves it. He can climb easily in and out of it. My only complaint is that it is very easy to fall out of since there isnt any sides, but its so low to the ground thats ok.Its definitaly worth the money. Little tikes products are great."
4,"He loves it , and he falls.","Me and my husband went and bought a toddler bed a weekago, and bought him the race car bed and he loves it! I Havent really had a problem with him getting out of it or fighting him to go to bed. He likes it much better then the crib. But two days after we got it he fell out of it in the middle of the night, and he did it again while he was taking a nap a few days later. i would suggest you place pillows or something soft on the other side of the bed cause it doent keep him in very well. When my son was sick he tried to sleep in our room but i got him and placed him back in his bed and i got in the bed with him and it really holds up with us both on there. But he likes it and thats the most important thing."
4,Good . . but could be better.,My son's grandparents bought him this bed once he got too big for his crib. He loved it right away. It's low to the ground so it's easy for him to get in and out of . . the only problem I have with this bed is that there are no side rails for the bed. My son is an active sleeper and tosses around a lot and sometimes he falls out of the bed and I find him on the floor. We tried stuffing pillows in the spaces between the mattress and the sides but sometimes he rolls right over them. If anyone knows of anything else that might help keep him from falling out at night . . please let me know!
3,"Not Bad,Not Good;Either","The Dropper Part that I have is'nt Pointe.It is kind of Diamond Shape.""Like two side Triangles"".Best I could describe it.Sucks up,about less than half;dropper Vial.I have another Dropper Bottle type.It sucks up,about half of dropper Vial.This must be a Closeout deal.Or a Bad batch someone needed to sell.I was the Sucker,they was waiting for.I wanted to send them back,regardless of there was a Refund or Not.I Have a Box now Collecting Dust.I only Used one of Bottles."
2,"Good bottle, bad droppers.","I just bought these a week ago, and I'm pretty disappointed. The bottles themselves are exactly what I wanted, but the dropper that's attached the bottle are really poorly conceived. The balloon at the top of the dropper isn't large enough, so when you squeeze it, release, and then unscrew the cap and extract the pipette, the pipette is only 1/3 full. In order to fully fill the pipette, you have to squeeze and release, then flip it upside-down so that air is at the top of the pipette and then squeeze it and hold it, flip it back to suck in more liquid, and then repeat that process until the pipette is filled.Basically, the small size of the balloon at the top of the pipette mars an otherwise great bottle."
5,delivered to doorstep,"I can't rate it because it was a gift for someone else. If it blows up an air mattress it's super, but not sure about heavier duty uses"
4,air,Only complaint was the tank valve.if you unscrew it to far the rubber seal will drop in the tank.then your left with a compressor that doesnt stop running! after ordering a replacement for free(2yr.warrentee) I got the idea of making my own rubber seal and its been great! no air leaks !Great compact size and air pressure for tools and blowing filters out.
5,Great compressor for winterizing a travel trailer,"I got this compressor to blow out the water lines in our travel trailer to winterize it. I used it withWinterize RV, Motorhome, Camper, and Travel Trailer Blow Out Adapter: Air Compressor to Male Garden Hose Faucet with Valveand the combination worked great. That adapter has a shutoff valve, so it was simple to close the valve, let the compressor build up pressure in the tank (max 150psi), then open the valve and have a burst of pressure to blow out the lines (I had the regulator set to 80psi). After doing that a number of times with each faucet or drain open (one or two at a time), the lines were clear of water (or clear enough for a Central Texas winter). A larger compressor would have done the job more quickly, but this one worked fine for me."
2,Did not last for 3 months.,I purchased the compressor to use with a framing nail gun. The nail gun requires about 100psi. For a while the compressor worked great. Plenty of air for the project I (building a small shed) was doing. I worked on the shed for a few hours on the weekends. After about 10 weeks I noticed the pressure control valve was very hard to turn. Then something broke and it was easy to turn but did not control the air pressure. Of course by then the compressor was out of warranty. I was expecting that with a light load the compressor would last at least a few years.The replacement valve assembly was about $40.00 (US).
1,Junk,Regulator broke after 4 uses and didn't get it fixed at a repair shop because the part and labor was as much as the compressor.
4,"Convenient, Light Weight","I needed a relatively light compressor, easy to transport and this suits my purposes. My other compressor is about twice the weight."
5,Item was like new.,I bought this item as refurbished. I have only had it for a few days but it seems to be fine. The compressor looks like it is brand new. I am very satisfied at this point.
2,Regulator did not work,"I bought this about one year ago for occasional household use. However I also bought a Dewalt cordless nailer which was serving my purpose until now. I opened the box and out of the box, regulator would not work. I had to take it to a authorized dealer and pay almost $100 for replacement of the regulator as my warranty has ran out. It works fine now. But advise to anyone buying this unit, beware of the regulator. I searched the internet and looks like several other people had same issue with regulator."
2,"No more ""break-in"" directions?","The web site instruction manual includes a 15 minute break in period and other posts have warned that this be done. That has been deleted from the printed manual included.If it is no longer required that is fine, maybe the manufacturing has improved or they do the break-in at the factory now (lol) but I did it for mine anyway. If you cared enough to read this far, you will too.The consequences are to great to skip this step. It is the purchasers last chance to overcome a factory mistake or oversight.Otherwise a 5 star, and yes I think it is important enough to strike 3 stars with an explanation.Included 13 hardware parts including hose with connectors already installed on both ends. No teflon tape included, but the two male ""quick"" connectors in the package had an adequate coat pre-applied."
1,Pathetic,"One has to wonder about quality control at Porter-Cable. The C2002-WK Pancake Compressor arrived in an intact box, not suggestive of any damage during shipment. However, the air compressor inside looked like it had been dropped from a third story balcony. The front regulator array was broken off most of its plastic attachments and skewed to the side. The whole top black regulator/pump apparatus was partially detached from the tank which flopped down and twisted when attempting to lift the unit by the handle. Pathetic. Very irritating to waste time repacking and mailing this grossly defective product back to Amazon."
2,review of the reviews,after reading the review through found very interesting trend most of the five star reviews were prior to 2010 and most of the one stars were more recent was considering buying new one since had very good experience with older one will not now buy.
1,buying through amazon will VOID WARRANTY ...compressor break after 4 months,"After only 4 months of sporadic use the tank pressure gauge stopped functioning, so no automatic switch off at full pressure...and the release valve rubber gasket had evaporated and leaked permanently.Amazon will not take it back and DeWalt - Porter Cable's parent company says warranty is limited. In the best scenario you would have to drive out to a remote repair shop. But when I told them I bought it through Amazon they said NO WARRANTY for ANYTHING sold by Amazon. Apparently they are trying to stop Amazon from selling. Amazon is not an authorized reseller...and that in DeWalt's book voids the warranty.I will stay away from both Amazon and Dewalt/ porter Cable and Black and Decker and Stanley products in the future. I feel I got screwed by both companies - Amazon for not telling and Dewalt for enforcing such a ridiculous rule."
2,Quit working,"Had this compressor for about 5 weeks and it quit pumping over 50 psi. Still kept running but would not get up past 50. Sent it in for warrenty work a couple weeks ago and have heard nothing. Update. Gotit back fixed, cost about $30to ship..."
1,Malfunctions right out of the box,"I opened the box, read the instructions, turned it on, and it wouldn't work. The drain valve was faulty and doesn't seal, so you can never get any pressure in the tank."
3,I had this for 4 years now,I haven't been the best to this compressor. I performed 0 maintenance to it and it frequently sits with a full tank. It still runs fine and no hose leaks. It is really loud. Not for condo or apartment use.It's so loud that I wouldn't buy it again. There are more powerful quieter compressors.
5,Has paid for itself.,Since I got this I have used it for nailing from putting up trim to framing a door opening. It's great that there is hardly any maintenance either. Great for doing small things around the house and yard. Very portable.
4,Handy light weight compressor,"I heard it may be loud, but during the course of a job from 10 feet away, it is barely an inconvenience. Worth the investment. Have already found multiple uses, in addition to the original flooring job."
4,Great small compressor,Great compressor but I would recommend replacing the hose it comes with. Hose is fine for occassional use but is not of the best quality. For the price you can't beat this product and it is a Porter-Cable which is known for it's quality.
1,Total Junk,"As others have stated, the manifold will not not pressurize, due to a faulty valve assembly at the manifold pressure regulator knob. Not worth the price, and definitely not worth the replacement cost of a new manifold. Yuck!"
1,do not buy-poor quality item,the output gauge showed zero pressure when the tank was at max pressure this is an indication that the regulator is bad.only used 4 times before this happened and of course i just past the 1 year warranty mark. not worth fixingstay away from this product
4,Great product but.....,I received this unit and was immediately impressed with the size. I plugged it in and tiled how long it took to fill and to my amazement it filled in less than a minute! Some smaller pancake type unit I have read take close to 5 mins. The one downer was that it didn't come with any hardware to set up the new hose I had purchased with it. I had to run to the hardware store to get the basics and then complete the set up. Kinda sucks. When you get something new you want to use it right away. Other than that its great
5,All your moneys worth,"This compressor and kit out of the box seems to be everything the average person needs to get just about anything done around the house that requires compressed air. Maybe borrow a nailgun from a friend or buy a disc sander etc. if needed. I am impressed with this unit so far, it is quiet (as far as air compressors go), powerful, small and light which makes it very portable. Accessory kit will get you started but maybe some higher end accessory tools will be needed for the future. I feel I'v got my moneys worth! Amazon had the best price and shipped fast and free!"
2,"Great product, recommended by many friends, BUT...",I had been told by several friends and family that this was a great product so I ordered it without hesitation. When it came it looked great and started right up so I thought I was set! Unfortunately the tank was not sealed and had to be returned. I give it 2 stars only as a warning to keep your packaging and prepare for a less desirable outcome. Even good reviews don't mean you won't end up with the DUD diamond in the rough! Best of luck!
2,No Pressure,When turned on the compressor runs but no pressure builds in tank and none is available to the attached hose. I can hear no leaks so I'm guessing the compressor itself is leaking internally.It took UPS 5 days to deliver the unit and it is now Saturday and the Porter Cable repair center is closed.I'll take it in on Monday. The work I had planned to do with the air compressor will have to wait.
2,Regulator broken afer a few light uses,"I primarily use this to inflate my vehicle tires. It worked fine when it worked but the regulator broke after only a dozen or so light uses. It still pumps air into the tank and builds pressure there, but the regulator gauge now shows 0 and no air comes out of the outlets. I googled around and it appears a very common problem with this unit. The regulator has to be replaced. It's really a shame that they went through the trouble to build such a seemingly solid unit, and then saved a few cents too much on a spring or something in the regulator, which itself probably costs less than $5."
2,No problems with compressor - horrible regulator,"I purchased this compressor (C2002 type 5) at the home cheepo store locally. I used it sporadically for about three months with a finish nailer and various other small tools and put it away for about 6 after that. Pulled it out this spring and fired it up.The tank will pressurize if the regulator is cranked to it's max (150psi) setting. However, if you reduce the tool pressure setting, the tank will also bleed off to the set pressure and cause the compressor to switch back on and run... and run... and run... while gaining no more pressure in the tank.The solution? go back to home cheepo and buy a secondary regulator and remove the original. Are there no useful, off-the-shelf consumer products? I would gladly have paid another $20 if this setup was more robust. AVOID THIS and keep looking. I can remember when Porter-cable only made quality tools."
3,Warning,"The first time I turned the pressure regulator knob the top of my thumb went under the cowling or shroud and it almost lacerated it. The cowling is very sharp and the knob should protrude further so there is no contact with it or at least provide a little more clearance. I don't have big fingers.A couple of weeks later I needed to cap-over three top rails on my deck with 5 nails each. Ouch, forgot about that knob. Couldn't get thru ten nails without having to wait for the pressure to build back up.On a positive note it is lightweight."
4,Nice compressor - noisy?,"My old compressor broke down after 35 years. The instructions on this compressor said not to use beyond the date on tank for risk of explosion. My old compressor didn't have that warning nor a date. WOW! Good thing the pump broke before the tank exploded. Same with propane tanks. Watch the expiration date on these tanks. It could hurt you or kill you.Cute compressor and works as I hoped. Very portable. But I think it's noisy. I measured it with my Radio Shack sound meter and it read 90 decibels at 10 feet. It is painfully loud. But then, compressors are noisy machines. You really should wear ear protection and run it when it won't bother the neighbors. I ran it in my garage with all the doors closed and when I stepped outside, it was still sounded noisy to me. My old compressor gave off a ""chug, chug, chug"" sound while this gives off a loud hum. With this guy, put on your ear plugs before you switch it on and don't forget your eye protection too!"
5,Great Customer Service,"Bought the compressor to take with us while we are RVing across the US. When it arrived, it was in perfect condition and no damage to the box. I did not check it out for about a week after receiving it and when I did the regulator was apparently defective, for it would not deliver any air. Only had about a week before our trip, so called Amazon.com to see how there return policy worked or did I need to take it to a repair shop for repairs, due to the short time line. It was not a problem. They sent me a new compressor 2nd day at there expense and e-mailed me the UPS labels to send back the defective one, with instructions not to return it until I had received the new one and verifying it was working properly. The second compressor works great and has the power to inflate our trailer and p/u tires to the high pressures that are required in a short period of time. With this kind of customer service, I will never hesitate to purchase any item from Amazon.com"
2,Fragile,"The pressure valve is really under built. The entire unit (pressure valve, both gauges, three outlets, pressure blow-off) needs to be replaced upon failure. It costs about $40 plus $12 shipping. This valve would last practically forever if Porter-Cable spent less than a cent more to make the plastic portion of the valve thicker. As it is built, it is almost gauranteed failure. I would recommend getting something more industrial from a different manufacturer."
2,OK for about a year of light finish nail use,"I am not really happy with mine!I bought mine from a big box ""DIY"" hardware store in a special package with three finish nail guns. It worked great (although very noisy!) for putting up a little trim around the house, here & there over the course of the last year or so.Last week - one of the hose connectors started leaking air whenever there is no hose plugged in, and yesterday the compressor itself started leaking air.It still seems to be able to generate enough air pressure to drive a nail in spite of the leak, but is now running constantly during any kind of work - or leaking out all the air pressure when shut off.I realize it was not an expensive compressor - but I am NOT hard the the thing, I don't use it often and don't ask it to do much other than drive a few 18 gauge finish nails. I thought it would last longer than this!"
3,not for framing,"First let me say I built houses for about 20 years. This will let you know where I am coming from. I bought this mainly for some trimming jobs around the house, as well as for my woodworking hobby. However for the first job I needed it for a small framing job. Let me tell you it will not keep up with even one framing gun without running almost constantly. I had to stop many times to finish setting nails by hand. I don't know how some can say it is good for framing. I am not as young as I used to be and wasn't moving all that fast and it still could not keep up with me. If that is what you plan to use it for I would get something different. This is not a concern to me because it was a very small job and I don't plan to use it for that much again. I do think it should work ok for what I plan to use it most for, trimming and woodworking."
5,perfect for the job,"I bought this for my Dad for Christmas. He loves it, he's using it to air up wagon tires and truck tires for his greenhouse/nursery."
1,A Lemon,"Nice looking machine but that was it. It did not work right out of the box. Plugged it in and the motor ran but it did not build up pressure, not a thing registered on any of the gauges. It's very loud so wear ear plugs. I would not recommend this brand item to anyone."
5,Impr4essive compressor,"I received the Porter-Cable C2002-WK-Oilfree compressor in a sturdy box, well packaged, with hand holds for easy carrying. Did the 15 minute run-in with the drain valve open as recommended. The compressor is noisy and builds up pressure very fast as others have reported. First use was as a ""portable"" air tank for filling car tires. No need for electric connection once the tank is full. Easily filled four tires with plenty of pressure left. Next task will be installing baseboards and rebuilding an old piece of furniture."
1,Design Flaw!,"Do not buy this compressor! I bought one of these as a backup compressor to our 20 year old one that has seen better days. I needed to use it the other day for the third time since new and it would not start. I took it to the Porter-Cable certified repair station and they knew immediately it was a broken manifold problem. They said it was the most common repair and they see it all the time. Obviously, it is a design problem that has yet to be corrected. This compressor is out of warranty even though it was only used two times. The bill to repair it was $98.00 and they told me it could happen again. Does it make sense to buy one of these? Absolutely not!"
4,good for home use,great for home use of tire inflation and power clean easy to use and also easy to store could use more quality in some of the attachments but other than that okay
3,"Easy enough to use, great for use at home","As other reviews have noted, this is not intended to be a contractor level compressor. My wife and I purchased it to blow out our sprinkler system at the end of the season.PRESSURE:It holds enough pressure to do one zone at a time, but we needed to run it continuously in order to complete the job.ACCESSORIES:The accessories that come with this purchase are worth about $30 if you were to buy an equivalent at Home Depot.OVERALL:The knobs on the regulator feel somewhat cheap, but it doesn't seem like they will break anytime soon. It is light enough to move around as needed anywhere in the house or outside. The overall size and footprint are small enough that it'll fit on most deep shelves if you choose to store it that way.For the ultimate goals of sprinkler maintenance, filling our car tires, recreational balls, etc. it'll work great. If we add on a finishing nailer or additional air tool, it'll be even more useful and worth the very reasonable price."
1,Disappointing,This product is a waste of time and money. It is all hype and no substance. Would like to get my money back.
1,This program is garbage.,"JETDefrag is lousy. The longest I've ever ran it was 37 hours and it still hardly put a dent in progress. I've contacted the company over and over, but they would never respond back. It's updates are unnecessarily large. Your computer ends up running significantly slower, while it's installed, as it robs your systems resources. Technical support is terrible, program performance is terrible. Do yourself a favor and don't buy this product."
1,Fix-It Utilities 7 wiped out EVERYTHING!,"The only fix for getting this mess off the computer is system restore. Being relatively computer savvy, this monster nearly cost us our shirts. Do NOT buy it! Under ANY circumstances! Use Zone Alarm - it's free!"
2,keycode type of regitration SUCKS,I have a 3 license product that only works on one computer. DON'T waste your money !!
1,Worst Product Ever,"Don't buy this product. My computer keeps crashing, can't even use safe mode. I tried to uninstall it and my computer crashes. Tech support is useless. You have to e-mail them and they come back with riduclous answers. No help at all. Stay away from this product."
1,Laguiole? La Return!,"For appreciaters of fine wine and cooking, the name Laguiole is legendary. Go to the finest restaurants in Paris and order a bottle of good wine. Chances are the waiter will use a handmade corkscrew made in the village of Laguiole to open it. However, fame has bred commercialization and dilution of this famed locale. This set from Sabatier is a major disappointment. I certainly did not expect the same quality as a hundred dollar bone corkscrew from the village, but the quality of the metal casting is abominable. The corkscrew does not retract! And you are expected to just screw and pull! The bottle opener does not open some caps! You are better off with a plastic Screwpull than this set. Sabatier should be embarrassed!"
1,not quite as described,"The Editorial Review states that "" an innkeeper's son in the small French town of Laguiole invented this style of folding knife in the early 1800s."" Unfortunately, the corkscrew does not fold.The Ed. Review also states that ""with this set in your pocket you can open. . . wine without a fuss."" That may be true, but I'd still be fussing about the hole in my pocket from that screw.Disappointing product, even at the low price."
1,Works Great -- For about ten minutes,"I was given one of these as a gift, maybe two years ago. I had grand plans of doing more freezing, but it hasn't happened the way I thought.The point is I've only used this thing about six or seven times. It no longer makes a seal. The heat strip heats up, but never any seal. Pretty disappointing - frustrating, really - especially after steam-blanching a whole bunch of veggies for freezing, only to find that it won't work. I had crossed my fingers, but no...it just won't work - AGAIN. ANYMORE.Pretty shoddy for something to crap out after so few uses."
2,Heating strip stops working on replacement unit,"Revised 2 star review:Got a hassle-free replacement unit after the first unit's heating strip stopped working. Now after only a couple dozen uses, while trying to seal a few vanilla beans, the heating strip has again stopped working :( Wanted to like this product, but I'm really annoyed!! Maybe I've just been too hard on it with leakage of wet items, but I've always cleaned the unit immediately after use. Gave it an extra star for customer service.Original 5 star review:Got this as a Christmas gift and used it dozens of times until the heating strip stopped working. I called the company's customer service, explained the situation (not expecting much), and they said they'd ship me a new one. Zero hassle. They didn't even ask me to send the old one back, so it found its way into the recycling bin. Received new machine in less than a week!!! Very satisfied with product and company. Can't wait to receive my sous vide machine and start playing!"
5,Food Saver,"After many years of ""freezer burned"" food, a friend told me about a no fail way to seal food for future use which really works. I can now buy in bulk as items we use go on sale, and safely seal and freeze. No more freezer burn !"
2,Piece of garbage,"I was very excited for this product. I got it for an amazing price, and I purchased 6 extra rolls of the bags to go along with it. When I tested it out last week, I was initially annoyed about the ""press and hold"" feature in order for it to work, but I brushed that aside, thinking that it would still be a great money saver provided it worked. The first two or three items I tried to seal did not work well, but I thought it was just an operator error on my part because I was able to finally get it to seal after the second or third attempt at pressing and holding and waiting. However, it has since stopped sealing after it goes through its vacuuming stage. Not only that, the vacuum stage isn't even completely pulling out the air any longer. So, instead of vacuuming out all of the air and then sealing the bag like it is supposed to, the stupid vacuum motor just runs and runs while only pulling out 2/3rds of the air in the bag. I'm really disappointed in the product."
4,Pretty good,Use it to store jerky and beans. It's not fancy but it does the job. Not bad. Let's see how it holds up but had it for a month so far and it works pretty good.
2,What a rip!!!!,"Warning: Toy is cute, but found at other places lots cheaper. Not as much fun as other LPS toys."
3,spring outlook,"overall the book was good and a market exists for this type of practical material. However, there were a few technical errors which I noticed because I use natural materials to make flies. I would recommend this book to others who tie their own flies."
3,A delightful read for those who enjoy finding out more about antiques,"I don't have a strong interest in antiques or prints. Nevertheless, I found the antiquing and antique print material absolutely fascinating, and definitely the most attractive element of this book. It's like getting parachuted down into the midst of the antique dealer's world, and that was the best part of the read. The writing is serviceable; the book moves along better than many do; the characters are not memorable, but they'll do. It's professionally done. But it's the antiques that drew me back to the next book in the series. If there's a drawback to this book, it's probably that occasionally it leans towards a tone reminiscent of Nancy Drew. But as long as she is in an interesting locale and talking about the print trade, I'm completely rapt."
2,stale,"This isn't a bad book but it's not great either. The heroine, Maggie is uninteresting. The plot is clever but it's carried out in a heavy handed manner. The pacing was slow, and quite dull. By page 13 I had figured out who was going to get killed and which character would be blamed for it. By the 50th page I knew who the killer was. The whole thing seemed horribly dry and stale."
5,A double biography of two black men who coped with the societal racism of early twentieth-century America,"Sociology professor Michael Schwalbe presents Remembering Reet And Shine: Two Black Men, One Struggle, a double biography of two black men who coped with the societal racism of early twentieth-century America and the pressures of their own families in dramatically different ways, yet both of whom saw their defenses crumble as the became older. Matthew Mason adopted the persona of Dr. Reet, a witty entertainer; while Anthony Atwater became Shine, a street-smart stud and a capital player at both love and violence. Both men would turn to drink to ease their problems, and nearly destroy themselves before finding peace for themselves in old age. A straightforward account that does not herald either man as heroic, but simply offers their profile in an attempt to understand their need to reconcile the demands of being a man with the limitations imposed by social forces."
4,Awesome history and great read!!!,"This book will be near and dear to our family; Shine is my husband's grandfather and I gave this to him as a birthday gift! He didnt know that the book was completed and available! We both enjoyed reading it and it was the most pleasant suprise that I could have given him. It includes family history and local history that we both were able to enjoy and reflect on.....we still live in Chapel Hill, NC and it was amazing to read about such close family history that we would have otherwise, not known! Thank you Schwalbe!!! We feel blessed to have his family's life documented so that he and our daughters will know their roots."
4,Very entertaining,"Gene Star gets more then he bargained for when he agrees to protected a mysterious woman and instead gets space pirates on his back and a badass spaceship called Outlaw Star. While this does have it's advantages, it's questionable if they outweigh the disadvantages. A spaceship takes alot of money to keep in order, and good work is so hard to find.Outlaw Star is a fun, rather comic book style anime with pretty good music, a decent plot, and amusing characters. It might not be all laughs but when it's not amusing you, it finds some other way entertain you."
4,a space aged comedy,if you are unfamiliar with the world of manga and anime this is one of the best starting positions you could find to jump right in. It's a space aged comedy about the tale of outlaw and his crew of coragous yet psychopathic crew of mercenaries and cat girls. But iif comedy isnt your bag of tricks then you wont be disappointed either with the serirs being filled to the brim with fantasy and high flying action and fantastic space battle scenes.
1,Not tight enough,"I was excited to find a mattress pad for XL full as they are hard to find but I was disappointed when I put it on my mattress. It does not fit tight enough on the sides because it does not have the elastic that pulls it under the mattress to keep it tight. Consequently, my fitted sheet keeps slipping off because of the movement of the mattress pad. Without the mattress pad, I don't have trouble with my fitted sheet."
3,tight & stiff,"I have a 15 inch xl full mattress and it is very tight on it. It is too bad they didn't put the stretchy material on the sides to accommodate a thicker mattress. It is rather scratchy feeling (rather stiff), but you can't really tell that under the sheets. It also needs a little more cushion. So, basically, I wish it was a little softer, a little more plump, and a had stretchy sides, but it does work on my hard to fit xl full."
3,Restful Nights??,I am disappointed in the product. I specifically wanted the Restful Nights brand of mattress pad. What I got was from Louisville bedding. The difference that I see is that the side piece is not the same soft material that is on the Restful Nights mattress pad.
2,Cheap materials,"I haven't gotten the mattress pad on my bed yet, but it should fit. I know its hard to find a full extra long pad but I am disappointed in the materials. The material is crunchy. I would say its hard to find the cotton in it. It will serve its purpose, but I do have a concern on how long it will last after several washes and drying. Be warned that drying is suppose to be on low and wash is suppose to be cold."
5,my boys can't get enough of these puzzles!,"my sons (aged 3 and 5) love these puzzles, I love these puzzles!! It was in perfect condition and it arrived on time."
5,Wet Your Appetite,"Laura Lagana, RN, (Laura@LauraLagana.com) Author & Editor of Touched by Angels of Mercy, Co-author of Chicken Soup for the Volunteer's Soul, and Serving Time, Serving Others:Shopping for a new kitchen, or just fantasizing? This book is for you. As you turn the first few pages, the creative designs and insightful photography will wet your appetite for more. Whether your taste leans toward palatial gourmet, or cozy cuisine, this book serves up a diverse menu to satisfy any palate. A superb rendering of ideas to bring any kitchen into the 21st century."
3,"Ok, but dated","I found this book useful, but pretty dated in terms of the pictures. I guess this happens with all books on fashion. The concepts are still good and I was able to take some ideas for my Kitchen remodel from it, but most of the specific styles remind me of the early 90s, not the 2010's."
4,Cute!,My granddaughters loved both of the Parent Trap books. They liked that their grandmother saw the original Hayley Mills version when I was their age in the movie theater.
3,"Good recreational read,","Somewhat reminiscent of Cussler, but not as technically convincing. Blend of history and current events - - fits in with the news and Aladdin's Lamp."
4,Great travel reading,"I received a copy of this novel from the author while standing in Rockefeller Center with the rest of the world who wished to show their signs on the Today Show. I was travelling on business and found the book to be perfect for my purposes. Lots of action broken up into three minute or so reads. It was easy to pick up and put down, and it always kept my attention. I would describe the book as a cross between Clive Cussler and Tom Clancy (without an overwhelming amount of technical jargon). It is a great escape."
4,The Possibilities Are Possible,"While reading OMAR, you may consider the actual possibilities of these types of terrorist attacks happening. And, you may consider them probable. The writer has so well defined the details, emotions, locations and events of these attacks, one needs little imagination to conger up the feeling of being there as a witness to the attacks as they occur."
5,A thrilling novel of escalating global terrorism,"Craig Thompson's Omar is a suspenseful and thrilling novel of escalating global terrorism. When a priceless book is found 2077 fathoms under the North Atlantic Ice Barrier, the CIA/FBI, a private billionaire oilman, and a fanatic terrorist group compete to recover and claim it. The competition has potentially cataclysmic effects for the known world. Omar is a shocking, action-packed, highly recommended page-turner filled with suspense and plot twists to the end. Omar is also available in paperback (0967520722, [price])"
5,"Still relevant, perhaps even more so today!","I found this novel to be well written, well researched, and realistic. I highly recommend it to any adventure seeker."
5,"Easy to use, gets results","I was doubtful, but this video workout is excellent. She's a clear and enthusiastic instructor, and it's nice that the workout is broken into three parts. I'd like to find another Kathy Ireland tape that is similar -- not interested in the ""12 minute buns"" or high-intensity aerobics. This workout is great for new and experienced exercise lovers. An outstanding value, with no need to purchase weights. All you need is a mat or towel and a sturdy chair. Good luck!"
3,a good low impact workout,I have been using this workout tape for about 2 years. I really like to use it when I am tired and not up for a really intense workout. It is definately low impact with easy to follow moves and works all your large muscles. You will work a mild sweat if you are used to doing really intense workouts
4,It's pretty good..,"The tape is broken into three parts. The first is aerobics and you just do alot of repititions of low impact moves. It's not very challenging but you can always add 3 pound weights for some of the moves for arms or leg weights. [that's wat i did] The second part consist of toning your legs mostly. You can REALLY feel the exercises for these. The third is basically also toning for legs and for abs but aren't as challenging so i suggest you to do your own sets for those. After all that, they have a 15 minute question session. The workout portion of the tape adds up to about a little more than an hour =/ so might not be good if you have a tight schedule. Also, i personally think the only reason they sweat so much is because it was so hot out there lol."
5,Kathy Ireland fitness video,"I had this video ten years ago and looked for it a few months ago to start using it. I couldn't find it in the house, so, naturally I looked on amazon.com. I was very pleased to see it was still available. I love Kathy Ireland and this is a video that your average woman can do and also for seniors. I am in my 50's and overweight and this video is doable and makes you feel great when you are done! FIVE STARS!"
1,No Good,This workout is not tough at all. I think the only reason they were sweating was because they were out in the sun. It's boring and goes too slow.
4,Great iPod stero dock,"It's a very nicely designed stero dock for iPod, especially, the convenience to connect iPod to our stero system and power charge function. Further more, the remote control can easily adjust volume and prev/next song for music playing. It's a big plus for the product. The color and shape also nicely match with iPod style. I like my choice.However, nothing is perfect. I would like to see the expansion of the remote control funtions to be able to move up/down level to select either playlist/artist/album, etc. and/or select which song to play. Right now, I have to un-dock iPod to choose playlist/artist/album and select the 1st song I like to hear. Then, re-dock the iPod and play it from the remote control. It will be perfect if we only un-dock iPod to sync with PC. Anything else can be controlled from the remote control.In all, it's a great iPod stero dock product for the price we paid for."
4,Good quality ipod dock,"The dock works as advertised. You have to make sure to kick the volume all the way up using the supplied remote (the ipod volume setting has no effect). The remote control works at very short distances if pointed straight at the dock. I can only get it to work up to about 10ft. Not a big problem for me once I ""transfered"" the small remote onto an universal learning type. But, since the included remote is so weak, there goes one star from my rating...For the money and at this price point this is the best audio-only dock you can buy that sports an infrared remote control - there are a few other options out there that use radio remotes and can not be integrated into an IR-only universal remote. I wanted to hook it up to a receiver, so having a dock controllable by IR instead of radio was really important to me. Even the bigger brother of this dock, the Kensigton 500 uses radio instead of IR."
5,Ipod playing thru my stereo system,"I got this for my son, but I have used it almost as much as he has. It hooked up in a snap. The remote control is great and now rather than switching CDs we turn on the Ipod and listen to music throughout the house on our full size speakers. We love it."
3,"it's not a ""Transmitter"" !!!!","This is not a transmitter as listed. It's a dock with an infrared remote, with an audio out just like Apple's dock. It doesn't transmit anything, nor does it play music ""throughout the house"" unless you have that set up through your stereo system somehow. Hey, Amazon, check the accuracy of your listings!!!"
1,For the technologically challanged,"I bought my Grandson an Ipod for a gift,then I got to thinking about a ""docking station"" so I bought this item. To tell you the truth it might be a wonderful thing but I was told it didnt have speakers and needed to be hooked up to a stereo so I returned it and bought an AM/FM radio etc docking station. I have been caught like this before, not knowing that something for an XBOX needed a dvd to go with it. I guess its too much to ask for the manufacturer to be aware that all of its customers are not 20 or 30 something so I cant rate this item just make other Grammies/Grampies aware that this does not have speakers. Debbie Launer sadder but wiser Grammy"
5,Best Way to Use an IPod!,"Two things make this product an excellent way to get the sound out of your IPod: First, because the the Ipod dock attaches at the bottom and not through the earphone jack, the sound quality that comes out is the best possible; and, second, it charges as it plays. Add a stereo receiver/amp and some good speakers, and you can blow your music through the whole house."
3,Doesn't Work Well with Speakers,"This dock was super easy to hook up, but it plays ridiculously softly through our Bose speakers and has seemed to damage them. They now sound scratchy as we've had to turn the volume up a lot each time we've used it."
1,Kensington Stereo Dock for IPod,"I did not head the warnings from previous reviews. The IPod Stereo Dock does not work with the 5th generation IPods (IPods with Video). It freezes the Ipod or resets the Ipod, as well as scrambling the album covers.If you have an older Ipod, it works fine. But do not buy for the current generation 30/60GB Ipods. Kensington sent me 2 replacements with the same problem. They have no fix for the problem."
1,Sounds okay but remote doesn't work,"I had purchased on of the more expensive Kensington models that is supposed to display menus on you TV, only that feature didn't work. So I got this model that doesn't have that feature but costs less and the remote doesn't work."
5,"Exactly what I was looking for, comes with power supply","Comes with remote, and power supply. I was glad to see it also docks the nano. High quality product. Only complaint is the shameless self-promotion of the lit 'Kensington' on the front. I keep this device near the TV, and it can be just a little distracting."
3,Fast Forward/Rewind Does Not Work with 3rd Generation,"Although in most respects, the Kensington StereoDock is a terrific product, if you are buying it because you want to skip over songs from across the room, you'll be out of luck if you own a 3rd generation IPOD. The remote control only works to regulate volume."
1,Severely disappointed,"I've owned other Kensington products before; this is the first complete disappointment. I connected this product to my Denon receiver and found I had to increase my volume setting by over 30 dB to hear comparable output, or to put it otherwise, I would have blown out my speakers if I switched to any other signal. Since the Kensington provides a line output, changing the iPod volume does no good. Kensington's website claims this product would work with my 30GB iPod - the product literature does not list it as compatable. Maybe that's the problem. I don't know what they had in mind here; I've gone back to a $10 patch cable, which works just fine."
3,"Good for charging, not great for playback","I love this unit as a charger, but in hooking it up to my TV for audio playback, I always had problems with the volume. I'd have to crank it up on both the TV and the iPod to get it at a reasonably decent listening level."
2,Kensington IPOD stereo dock,This works fine for powering the Ipod but the volume is really bad does anyone have the same issue? I have no problem playing cd's or dvd's but the volume level is really low.
5,5th gen ipod works great,"I was a little leary based on the reviews which said 5th gen ipods wouldn't work. I connected this puppy to my 5th gen 30gb video ipod, connected it to my home theater system and it works great. All the remote functions work as advertised. I thought the sound quality was quite good. I can more easily tell the difference between songs I've ripped using Apple Lossless Encoder (ALE) vs. AAC or MP3. This is something I really couldn't tell with the earbuds. Going the apple route would make you buy a dock, power adapter, and a remote all separate for way more money.I would like to have seen it made in black. Kensington, do that and I'll buy another."
3,Muddy Sound Compared to Original Equipment Apple Dock,"I was attracted to this because of the remote, but a side-by-side listening of the Kensington vs. the standard Apple (non-remote) dock proves that the sound quality is muddy and volume somewhat attenuated. I have both connected into my Onkyo 80 watt receiver and have tested to make sure it's not the different cables used to connect (the Kensington comes with its own).Be cautious if you care about sound quality. The Kensington is convenient but not as good sounding as the Apple dock."
4,Works great,"This product works great, just as described. The control is really easy to use and the whole dock sits nicely of the desk attached to my speaker system. Really it's great for the price you pay."
2,Poor sound quality,"Playing my iPod through this device resulted in a major loss of sound quality. Music was very muted, with only the bass coming through with any clarity. Using the same settings on the iPod and stereo, I plugged the iPod directly to the stereo (using the headphone jack and a connector from Radio Shack that plugged into audio-in port on the stereo)and the sound quality improved noticeably over the sound through the Kensington dock. I am not an audiophile, so I am not talking about some marginal difference in the sound quality; playing the iPod through this product sounded really terrible. I would advise against purchasing it unless some changes are made to improve the sound.Since I paid only $30 for it, I will keep it to use as a charger for the iPod, but will not hook it up to my stereo."
4,Works great,"I've had a chance to use my new stereo dock for 3 or 4 times so far and I think it works great. Does exactly what I wanted it to. The instructions on the set up are very minimal so if your looking for more details you'll have to go to the Kensington website especially if your troubleshooting. I wasn't getting any sound through my stereo at first until my husband figured out that the volume of the dock itself was not even on.Also, you can't go through your ipods' Menu using the docks' remote but you can't see the ipod screen from than a couple feet away anyway."
3,OK for an inexpensive dock,"This is the first iPod dock I have purchased and I was a little surprised that the volume on the iPod had to go to full volume to get enough out of a 100 watt per channel amp. The downside with that is if the iPod is set to a mid volume level and someone changes the input selection on the amp, you can blow the speakers in a heartbeat. A little more gain would have solved that issue, or a better design might include some form of compression on higher volume iPod settings. In short, if you have kids or non technical people around this unit the collateral damage to your speakers could be highly likely."
5,Kensington 33164 StereoDock Charger and Transmitter,I am happy with this product.It does everything I expected and does it well at half the price of others.
5,"Worms, Magic Tricks, and Gnomes!","Here are three more 22 minute episodes from the Goosebumps TV series based on the books by R.L. Stine.In Go Eat Worms, Todd Bastrow is obsessed with worms and torturing his sister with them, but then the worms start playing tricks on him.Tim Swanson is an amateur magician in Bad Hare Day, in which he sneaks out with his little sister to go to the Amaz-O Magic Show. Tim ends up stealing the Amaz-O's bag of tricks.Revenge of the Lawn Gnomes is the best on this disc, where the lawn gnomes come to life at night and wreck the neighbor's yard.These three tales would make a great addition to your DVD collection!"
5,FUN AND SCARY,My grandson likes to be grossed out and scared and this movie was good for both. He watches it again and again. Now its not as creepy for him but he still loves it. Great buy!!
5,Good Deal,These hold up better than some other tees I've bought recently. They don't break after just one use.
2,Text book - descriptive but not informative,"I had to purchase this book for a class I'm taking towards my MBA. I have to say that I have yet to read anything in it that isn't just a summary of information I've heard or read before - or even something that's just intuitive for anyone that's been in the business world for just a few years.Had I known this book would provide such little insight into the underlying strategies and applications of CRM, and would therefore not even be necessary to read in order to write papers or join in discussions for my class, I would not have purchased it."
1,Expensive mistake,These pretzels were extremely bitter with a bad aftertaste. I tried to return but was unable and ultimately had to throw the whole box in the trash. Do not waste your money like I did!
3,"Good, but not great","These are good, but not as good as the plain ones (without poppy seeds). It's fun to put them on all your fingers and then eat them, but they are not quite salty enough for me."
3,I didn't like him,"I read many romances and have enjoyed many of Ms. Thornton's other books. However, the hero in this book is not very likeable. He is a bit of a bully and doesn't seem to care very much for how anyone else feels. Alpha males are great--but they have to have some good qualities (and handsome doesn't count)."
3,Too Difficult For The Beginners,"This book is seemingly easy to read, but then the concepts get more difficult and seem to lean more towards the technical side. I think if you have had Web authoring experience, then this book is perfect for you."
3,"A decent book, but author support? ""I've had better!""","There are two reasons I bought this particular book. The first is that I needed some additional information about using FP98. The second is that David Karlins (the author), promises e-mail support with questions you may have. In fact, he prints his direct e-mail address in numerous places. Well, I had several questions, and after extensive researching, just couldn't find the answers in the book or on his Web site. So, I e-mailed Mr. Karlins with my questions. At any rate, he responded within a day but not with the answers I needed, but an invitation to check out his Web site again! Can you imagine? I feel like he hoodwinked me. Now I don't know if he just doesn't know the answers, was promoting his site some more or a combination of both. Anyway, a decent book, but if he treats you like he did me, you'll find the complete experience to be lacking. Take care:-)"
5,Solid overview of FrontPage 98 and web authoring basics.,"Have had FrontPage 98 on my computer for 6 months and never used it. Bought David's book and have been very impressed. Has made starting my own perosnal web site much easier and fun than if I had tried to start using FrontPage98 without knowing anything. Look forward to reading more of his books. Great content for people who want to use FrontPage98 to author webpages, but do not want to make a career out of learning the program."

3,A good general overview of modern physics.,"While I did enjoy ""Who's afraid..."" it left me wanting more detail. I would have preferred the author cover half as many topics in twice the detail. Or even better, leave the book as is, but include references for additional reading/study at the end of each section. If physics is not your passion and you merely want to be semi-intelligent for party conversation, then this would be a good selection."
2,You want to be more confused? Get this book.,"I don't understand why people who write about science have to show off how smart they are by using English words no one understands. Quantum mechanics is difficult as it is - no need to make it more so.Also, the book skips from one subject to another like the squirrels in my garden jump from one fruit tree to the other.Not a very good book, although some people with insomnia may like it."
3,"Nice, but...............","I have this since last year. I love the color, however, the bottom of it arrived with bit rust. As time goes, it gets worst. I took 2 stars off due to The price and the rust. I had other similar colander, it did not cost as much. Other then the paint issue, it works ok.5/2010After 2 years, I am still happy with this Colander, I use it almost everyday. Yeah, about the rust, it gets worst, but thank goodness only stay at the bottom of it. It's pretty much full circle now, but for the time I have enjoy the pretty color and I believed it's going to last bit longer, no regret."
3,small and heavy,this is a small colander and is heavy for its size it is durable and delightful IF you want something that cannot accomodate a great deal of food.
3,Becareful THIS BRAND CHIPS BADLY,Read the reviews for the other Tourquoise color and you'll see that people are complaining this brand chips with light useage. Beware.
2,"Pretty, nice size but rusts easily","I bought this because I just loved the pink color and the size is perfect. I used it a few times and was very careful to wash and dry it right away. Well, I forgot one evening and after just one day (less than 24 hours) in the sink with water, I had rust that I can't get off inside outside - buy the holes, by the rim and by the handle. What a big disappointment. It's trash now. Pretty color but don't leave it sitting in water like I did. Five stars for color, zero stars for durability. Disappointing. Don't buy unless you only want it for decoration. I have the larger one too but I don't use it and won't for this reason."
4,Falconer just won't die,"It's depressing to see people judging this album based on the lineup. Yes it sucks that Matthias Blad isn't in the Falconer anymore but they did well finding someone with a similar voice who would preserve the sound of the band. Kristoffer and Matthias actually sing together or trade off on several of the tracks and they sound like identical twins. This is a great album in the tradition of the first two. The songwriting is creative and diverse, definitely more so than on Chapters. The hints of accoustic guitar, keybords and operatic backing vocals all combine to create a very mystical atmosphere in the midst of driving power metal that Falconer has always done better than most. Docked a partly for the lyrics, which really needed to be proofread by a native speaker, and the minimalist liner notes reading like a zany video game quote."
3,Decent power metal,"This was my first Falconer album so I don't know what the previous singer sounded like to make a comparison, as others have. I like his voice; at times I hears hints of Ozzy or Eric Adams of Manowar. This band reminds me of Manowar a bit but I'm not a big metalhead so I can't make any other comparisons for you. I don't like real angry heavy metal, so this fits the bill for me as it is a concept album, telling a story song-by-song. I like the medieval touches; I wish there was a bit more of them. I also like the tempo changes and furious double-bass drumming, but the songwriting could be a bit stronger. Half the songs are good; the other half don't really stick as outstanding."
3,Good lens,Good lens overall. only recently had issues with manual focus not working properly (can't turn the focus ring to manually focus).
2,Don't be tempted by the low price,"I made the mistake of trying to save money when I switched from Nikon to Canon. I bought this and Sigma's 17-35 f/2.8-4 DG EX while building my new system. I ended up selling my Sigma lenses to buy a Canon 17-40 f/4 L and a Canon 70-200 f/2.8 L lens. Sigma lenses are very tempting because they cost much less then Canon or Nikon lenses. Unfortunately they are cheaper for a reason. The images produced are much softer, the lens itself is not as sturdy, and it doesn't focus as fast. If you have to go bargain basement they are not that bad. They are really just expensive consumer lenses not cheap pro lenses. If you are trying to work as a professional you have to go with brand name lenses. They don't cost more just because of the name on the lens, there are major performance benefits."
2,"a slow read, but sometimes interesting","I found the book interesting in that we get a lot of exposition about Thailand from someone who obviously loves the place. The story and characters, however, were weak and uninteresting. Had the author tried a travel guide, it would've been a heck of a good one."
2,smell too strong,"The scent is way too strong, I'm guessing they need to hide the petroleum smell and the color is too dark. It stained the paraffin bath it was put in to, not good. The wax was not as brittle as others that I have tried."
1,"The Greatest Hollywood Unsolved Mystery, as the Black Dahlia is also","Who killed William Desmond Taylor, we will never know. But this Boring piece of trite, can be passed on. The only real interesting book on the subject is “A Cast of Killers” by Sidney D. Kirkpatrick, which is ready available. Buy the Kirkpatrick book, it is the Best One on the Subject."
2,"The stapler is great, but good luck finding staples","As the previous reviewer stated, this is a great concept and tool... If you can find the staples. This is not like Arrow, where you can find staples just about anywhere. If you do buy this stapler, go ahead and stock up on staples for sure, as you'll have a hard time finding staples if you come into a bind and need them quickly. Great product, but it's limited availibility for the tacker itself, and the staples is not helpfull at all. I'll stick with my Arrow T2025, which has adjustable depth as well."
3,CALLING ALL CHUBBY CHASERS...,"This book is often funny and, at times, reads as if it were a stand up comedy routine. It tells the story of an overweight young man, Sonny Walker, who is dumped by his erstwhile girlfriend, Marsha, for his having put on about seventy five pounds more than she could stand. He then goes on a personal odyssey to lose weight, joining a weight loss group, where he meets the obese but luscious Kayla. This book is their story.Funny and irreverent, the book suffers at times from stereotypic, one dimensional characterizations. It is a plot driven book that often has the reader thinking that something good is just around the corner on the next page. Sometimes it is, and sometimes it isn't. The book has its ups and downs."
4,A Romance Novel for Normal People,"In a vastly growing community of ""up-and-coming"" African American writers, it is becoming increasingly difficult to find someone with a unique voice and approach on relationships.Van Whitfield has successfully done just that. While Terry McMillian and Eric Jerome Dickey contiue to provied interesting stories about the young, black and always beautiful, Whitfield shows us that sometimes the beautiful may not posess a 36-24-36 figure.His characters are genuine, sensative and very real. Humorous would be an understatement. But most of all the story, situations and emotions expressed are very believable.If you want read a book that takes you into the lives of other people but still allows you to stay on the planet of reality, this is the book for you."
2,"Okay, There are Some Things Wrong with this Book","I was first introduced to this novel by one of my best friends as he and I rode down the street. ""You've got to read this,"" he said. I admit that by the time we reached out destination, I was a bit turned off by the idea that Marsha would dump Sonny based on a few pounds: ""...you're telling me that you're going to let a little weight come between us?"" ""No Sonny...YOU let a LOT of weight come between us..."" However - I was also moderately interested. I couldn't help wondering if Sonny was going to lose the weight or continue to lose out to Cheesecake! This book would DEFINITELY NOT rank on my top ten list of all-time favorites, but it would not finish dead last, either. It's an okay read (better than Whitfield's first book - ""Beeperless Remote"") I think anyone who has ever struggled with any type of weight loss will get a couple of giggles out of this novel."
2,Moderate - Lukewarm,"The book was moderate, somewhat entertaining. Sonny weakness displayed low-self esteem and self pity. It was like reading a book about an over-weight man with romance problems."
4,"Situations are extreme, message is heartfeltly meant.","I am an overweight,educated,black male. I can truely identify with Sonny. The situations he presented in the book were extreme, yet funny. Reminded me of times being on a plane or working with children and the things some of them say about overweight people. You really can't and shouldn't get to upset.The book strongly suggest that there are others that are battling to lose weight and keep it off and that gives one the encourgement to again strive for a better lifestyle.The humor with the other charaters was also really enjoyed and appreciated."
2,SOMETHING'S WRONG WITH SOMETHING'S WRONG,"After reading ""Beeperless Remote"" and loving it thoroughly, I couldn't wait to read ""Something's Wrong With Your Scale."" In the beginning the story seemed interesting but I believe the constant references to losing weight, fat jokes, etc., began to weigh on me (no pun intended). I guess I just couldn't get into the character of Sonny Walker and his friend Kayla. I just couldn't get with it. Fortunately I did complete the whole book but it really didn't do anything for me. Some parts were funny but I guess I kept comparing it to the wonderful ""Beeperless Remote."" But I haven't given up hope. I still love Van's style of writing and look forward to other books that he writes."
3,Interesting,"Van has an excellent sense of humor and I really enjoy his writing. Beeperless was one of my favorite books for the simplicity of it. Unlike Beeperless, 'Scale' tried to add a touch more intellect with the characters. I enjoyed Scale for the similarities I saw in Sonny and myself (the wieght issues) but there was an underlying unenjoyment of the story. I felt as if it over-sensualized the 'eating' part and not the reason behind the eating. I dont think he delved deeper into Sonny enough. There were issues about his family that weren't addressed and also there could have been more about Marsha and her reasoning. Instead all we got on the 'skinny'side was Sonny's narrow minded [and I loved their characters and their feelings] friends. There was just so much more to this story, as we so often aren't shown overweight-pleasingly/plump, fat people [whatever we like to be called]."
2,"The Book is O.K., but it has a lot of stereotypes","The book had it's funny points, however, it was riddled with stereotypical characters. For example, all the fat people constantly thought about food, and when they did get some, they ate enormous amounts; educated people were obnoxious; slender women thought they were better than fat women; and, no man (even a fat one) in his right mind would be interested in a fat woman, among other stereotypes. Parts of the book seemed rushed. I think Mr. Whitfield should have ""slowed his roll"" in parts of the book."
3,Okay.,"The book was okay and had me laughing. But the only people I would be able to recommend it to would be the thin ones! Like the Nutty Professor, I think overweight people would have a problem with his humor!"
4,Read it now!,If you've read Beeperless Remotes and Guys In Suites you will definately like Something's Wrong With Your Scale. This book mixes comedy with romance and keeps your attention (which is one of the things I like most). If you don't read this you'll be missing a treat. Warning: It may seem to move a little slow at times but believe me it WILL pick up and when it does you WILL be hooked!
5,Sweet and Motivating,"I recommend this book to anyone that appreciates a good love story, and needs inspiration and motivation on a quest for weight loss. For anyone that is struggling with their weight, they will find that a book like this serves as a reminder that they are not alone, and that others understand what they are going through. The author nailed the character of Kayla. She represents all of our mothers, sisters, aunts, nieces, and best girl friends."
3,Funny but.....,"I enjoyed the book, there was too much emphasis on the food though. I did not like the way that Kayla seemed to have no willpower AT ALL. She thought nothing of eating a meal for two all by herself. The character of Sonny was ok, he redeemed himself by losing some of the weight. The story was kind of boring at some points and at others I must admit I did find myself laughing. It will be interesting to see what kind of storyline Van comes up with the next time. What happened to the sequel to Beeperless Remote? Peace!"
1,Written like a sitcom,"This book was horrible. Yes, it did have some funny scenes in the restaurant. Aside from that it wasn't worth the paper it was printed on.This book is written just like a WB sitcom right down to the token whiteguy they called ""E"". Don't waste your time on this. 1 star is being generous. I should gotten 5 stars for reading this dribble."
1,"Story that needed to be told, but not by Van Whitfield!","As an avid reader who tries to read stuff from all different kinds of people from all over the world, this book sounded intriguing to me.After reading the first few pages, my excitement turned to disgust. A disgust that anything this terrible would make it passed the slush pile.The book has a severe ego to it, shouting off African-American celebrities right and left. My question is, if people like Allen Iverson and Chris Rock are already celebs, why do you have to tell me who they are! I KNOW WHO THESE PEOPLE ARE! (Chris Rock, big time comedian. Allen Iverson, Philadelphia 76ers star.) It added nothing to the book except page after page that could of been ripped out and no one would of been able to notice.I actually took this book out of the library, and didn't buy it. It is not worth reading in any form. Library, New, Hardback, Paperback etc. Anyway you present it, it's story about self esteem that needed to be told, but not by Van Whitfield."
3,"BETTER THAN ""BEEPERLESS REMOTE""!",THIS BOOK IS BETTER THAN BEEPERLESS REMOTE. IT WAS FUNNY AND IT KEPT MY ATTENTION A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN MR WHITFIELD'S OTHER NOVEL. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO SOMEONE WHO NEEDS A LAUGH.
5,"Funny, funny, funnnnnnny!",This book was funny from beginning to end. I read it in one day. If your looking for a laugh this is the one to read. You won't want to put it down and you'll wish it never ends.
4,I laughed until I cryed,"Van Whitfield, this book was too funny. The cover cost my eye. Because I'm a full figured woman I could relate with some of the issues that Kayla and Sonny faced. Kayle was a CONFIDENT FULL FIGURED WOMEN. Van, I wish the best. Be Blessed."
5,"Great Buy, Great Service","Bought these for my grandson's birthday and he loves them. Love the different colors, and these are of quality grade. The folks who sell these are consumer oriented, e-mailing the progress of the shipment and providing coupons for future purchases. These were shipped promptly, received in excellent condition. Shipping costs were reasonable, unlike many who are additionally profiting with jacking up shipping expenses! I will do business with these people again."
3,Reasonable headphones,"I am not an audiophile and was looking for a pair of comfortable headphones that I could wear several hours a day for my work. What I like about these headphones is that the volume is loud, so when I get a soft dictator (I work as a transcriptionist), I can usually get enough sound to make out what s/he is saying. They are also pretty sturdy for daily use, and the price was good. As far as comfort, they could be more comfortable. I have gotten used to wearing them for four hours at a time, but I wish they were a little lighter. I added padding to the top of the headband, but I still have to be careful to get them adjusted to where the band is not pressing down on the top of my head so hard as to cause a headache. Also, they are a very tight fit around my ears, but the advantage to this is that more outside noise is blocked."
2,One major flaw...,"These headphones provide excellent sound quality. They do not produce excessive bass like many headphones, but provide excellent sound at bass, middle, and treble frequencies. For the price (and when I bought them, they were $80, not $50), the sound is fantastic. They are fairly comfortable.HOWEVER, these headphones have one major flaw. The plastic headband is extremely thin and broke after less than 2 years of use! For the last year, I continued to superglue it back together several times. Now they look like crap and its not even worth the time to reglue them.I may buy another (more durable) pair of Audio Technica headphones, because I trust the sound quality will be top notch, and don't want to try another pair that I may be disappointed in. But if you're considering buying these, buy a different pair unless you're going to treat them like they're made of glass. The headband is probably 1/8"" thin and any impact could ruin your phones. Not worth it."
3,Small book,I really like the content of this book. I purchased it for a housewarming gift for my sister. The only disappointment is that I thought it was a full size book. It is a small book.
1,Weak Pump,"I bought this pump for a small pond with a bubbler and small waterfall feature. It is hardly strong enough for the bubbler and does not provide any flow for the waterfall at all. It might work for a small fountain, but definitely don't buy this for a pond. Weak!"
2,"Not as fun as original Rush Hour, poor construction quality","The original Rush Hour is still much more fun. The only reason I had to buy this is my son is such a train freak. The puzzles are not as challenging overall, yet the difficulty level is a bit uneven in the four categories (junior, beginner, intermediate, advanced). Also, the build quality is poorer, as a few of the train pieces don't sit properly on the board, and the colors on the train pieces do not match those printed on the puzzle cards, a sore point for a young boy."
5,Super right out the box,"You open the box and get right to play, with instructions so easy they are almost self-explanatory. Even the youngest in the family has early successes on this game -- it's a winner.Non-competitive, brainy game.Best of all, kids can play by themselves (just one player) if they are so inclined. In that regard, it reminds us of another favorite game: Castle Logix.Castle LogixThis game is a keeper. It would be a great gift for any family.We also like Castle Logix, another game with increasing levels of difficulty. And Tantrix.Family Games tantrix discovery game packCastle Logix"
4,Good Purchase,"My little brother received this game a few years back and I remember it being fun so I ordered it for my own son, now 7. I enjoy it too. Since it has different levels truly almost anyone can play with it."
5,Brain Game,I purchased this for my 6 1/2 year old grandson. He zipped through the beginner cards and has done very well with the intermedite cards. The expert cards are more challenging for him but he loves playing this game.
5,Hours and Hours and Hours of Play-ability....!,"This is one of the best games I have ever bought. My 6-year old and 3-year old daughters love it, and dad does too. You can play it over and over again, because once you solve a puzzle you won't remember how you did it. A WINNER, and I'm waiting to see what they come up with next...."
3,The best DVD I never saw.,"This is, too my mind, the best performance ever of the best play ever; but the DVD format is incompatible with US DVD players."
1,King Lear,Very old tape. Creaky at parts when played. Looked like an old reject from Rental shop. Very disappointed
5,Real help for English Teachers,"Jago's book made this former English teacher want to get back into the classroom. Both practical and inspiring, it is the best guide I have seen for helping teachers to re-engage the complex but oh-so-rewarding texts that we've almost given up on thinking we can teach in this video-driven and impatient age. Done right, her tough-minded but realistic advice will open up the complex riches that await the teacher and the student of enduring literature--riches we underestimate until we read how Jago, herself, has succeeded mightily in passing them on to her initially-resistant charges at Santa Monica high school. This is a book I will retun to regularly. If you are an English teacher, or a person concerned by the slow dying of the literary light, get this book and read it carefully--and buy it for an English teacher you know."
4,with rigor,After reading this book I think every high school literature teacher should give this book a chance. The author has done a good job sharing her experiences and has also shares some (what I think) great teaching tips. She has provided a list of grade level books and how the readings should be paired to provide students a better comparison of some of the classic works.
3,A mixed bag,"Some songs on this album are too ""Big Band"" for me. The female choral in the background in ""So Nice"" and ""Mister Sandman"" are aweful in my opinion. But 'S Wonderful has nice touch. ""Tous deux tout Doux"" is nice and electronica-style -- and clearly doesn't belong on this album! I don't listen to this album that much anymore because it's such a mixed bag."
3,Quantity over Quality,"I have the 2002 edition of the Book and CD-ROM, I can only hope that Kaplan has made the CD software more bugfree. Today I was planning on taking one of the practice tests on the CD-ROM and my computer has repeatedly crashed(once while I was half-way into the verbal section.)The software has 18 practice sections that have been very helpful and IF the 3 full-length tests would not cause my computer to crash, I could recommend this product. Instead, I would recommend buying Barron's GRE book(it has 6 full-length tests on paper and many practice sections) and downloading PowerPrep from GRE.org.But like I implied above, the 2003 edition may have fixed the software problems..."
2,GRE for the Elementary School Child,"There were a few good study tips, but overall this book is lacking. It was written for the person with an eighth grade education taking the GRE. The software was written for an Elementary child. I do not need to be applauded when I get an answer correct, nor do I need cute animation to keep me motivated. On top of this, many of the features of the software did not work. This book is guaranteed to increase your score, but I feel it is guaranteed to lower your IQ (just my opinion). Stick with ETS study material."
4,What isn't being said about this book...,"I've attempted to use the Kaplan's CD to get ready for the GRE, but found several things down right irritating. The games on the CD, to put it bluntly, .... The vocabulary drill is limited. I've run two questions on the diagnosis GRE by math professors, and they considered the questions poorly worded. Every animated section is followed by a complete review on how to the take the GRE CAT, repeating for the most part the same stuff. The helpful tips are annoying. And I hate having to sit through the self-esteem building yeahs when I get something right on a drill....I bought this book for the math review, which it has done well.That's the bad part. As for the rest, I agree with the others."
3,Overated,"Yes, this did prove to be a helpful study guide. It was good for giving out a general strategy guide but otherwise was very lacking. For starters, the actual questions are not very similar to the ones on the GRE. There is a distinct difference in the kind of questions in the book and on the Powerprep software. My biggest complaint is the software that accompanies the book. I'm not sure who the target audience for this is supposed to be but it seems like it is designed for elementary school kids. It would have been nice to just have a basic review quide or something similar to the Powerprep software but instead Kaplan has given us Barney's guide to the GRE. Unfortunately I have an older computer with limited memory so this software crashes one out of every two times, so keep that in mind. Overall, it is helpful but be prepared for a headache with the software."
4,Get your learn on.,"In preparation for the GRE I bought this book, because it seemed to be the most popular. The book is efficacious because it gives a good simulation of what the GRE will be like. A small gripe is that I find the author to be vexatious because his writing style implies he is writing to a reluctant high school student, as opposed to the dedicated grad student potential, who is actually reading the book."
2,hardly worth it,"once again a DVD for which the producers did not manage to negociate the music rights.Lots of boring footage of the Stones doing small talk. Not very interesting, and there is no music even when you see them perform on stage. Reserved for the harcore fans"
3,A lot of unnecessary material,"The whole film is more a study about the athmosphere and spirit of the early sixties in Ireland at the time when the stones played there than about the group itself. Apart from a few interviewes (one with each member)it goes on and on about the opinion of the fans. And during the whole film you don't hear one single song from the Stones! You really have to be a ""hardcore-fan"" to enjoy this."
1,We miss the Stones in this,"This is a documentary about a band who played in Sweden atthe same time as Rolling Stones. We have an interview withsome people from that band, and we see a clip from a concert.The only pictures of the Stones is from an 8mm camera withno sound, taken summer 1965 in Malm&#65533;, Sweden. Those clipslasts for 2 minutes, and are sent over and over.And we get an interview with a woman Brian had an affair with, in Malm&#65533;, Sweden 1965.So for those who lived in Sweden in the sixties, it's a good movie. But to Stones fans around the world... I don't think so."
1,A Stones DVD Best Left Unturned,"Look, this documentary of the Rolling Stones' 1965 Irish tour is rubbish. The live concert footage has no accompanying sound, visual quality is poor and it looks like it's never been edited - shots of oblivious bystanders seem to go on forever and there is far too much of the Stones sleeping, or just sitting around.The only sequence of any interest, and even then only to hardcore completist Stones fans like me, are two illuminating interviews with Bill Wyman and Brian Jones: Wyman makes a distinction between being a pop star and being a musician; while the expression of sheer panic on Jones' face when the interviewer interrupts his dissertation on surrealism by asking him to define surreal is priceless."
5,bring this back into print!,"A marvelous collection of photos, images, and text about this revolutionary woman. More than just a performance artist, Isadora Duncan helped to usher in modernism and her artist contributions are here beautifully captured in text and image. Many of these picutres have never before been printed, at least in material I've seen, and the captioning of the photos provides detailed information."
2,life into art,the book was in good condition. it came timely. i really did not read much of it. maybe it is better if i read it
2,Did not last an hour!!!,"The top had a few good spins......once my little hurricane started playing with it, the metal rod, I guess< got bent and now we can not pump it to spin.."
4,My Kids keep coming back to it,"We have had this top for 2 years now. It's been one of the toys my girls consistently pull out to play with. It sounds a bit like a harmonica when they get it going. The handle comes off which makes it easier to store. My children are now 2 & 4, and it's one of our regular standbys. Both of them seemed to be able to get the hang of it at about age 2. I like that it doesn't have electronic music or voices. It's a good, traditional, fun toy. The only reason I don't give it 5 starts is because there are a few toys out there that are really versatile & stimulate creativity, thinking & extended play. The top can be used as, well...a top."
2,Not for a Toddler,Grandson has tried to play with this but it is just too hard for little hands to push down the spin rod. Do not recommend it for three and under.
4,great attention grabber!,"my 19 month old loves the toy for its colors, I like it because it allows me to get more chores finished in the kitchen! It has a nice suction base to keep the top steady on tile. It was a little difficult at first, for my son to handle, since a good bit of strength is needed to push the bar down especially if you want to hear it hum and spin fast. The colors are pretty cool, The faster it spins the more colors come out (primary + yellow/orange colors). I like that it holds his interest. A [...] could defentley get this down better but at least there is room to grow!"
3,Its OK.....but,The top is fascinating as it spins. It humms and changes color. The only major complaint is that it is not very durable. After only 4 days my 14 month old son was able to pull the whole top spinner handle off from the top of the top!! He has done this several times. Not a good feature. I may need to find a way to super glue the handle in place. For now I put the toy away until he gets a little older
3,More Plastic Than I Expected...,"I was quite disappointed to find that the red and blue ""handle"" of this toy is made out of plastic ... Since it is such a classic toy and is partially tin, I had expected the other parts to be a higher quality and perhaps to be made out of wood. I don't think I would have ordered it if I had realized beforehand that about 70% or so of this toy is plastic... It just feels cheap. Love the concept, hate the plastic."
2,Spinning Top,"The top is brightly colored and was able to spin easily. However, the suction cup on the bottom did not work and was useless. After about 3 weeks of use, the handle broke and I was not able to repair the top. Yes the top did provide the stimulation it advertised but the durability of the product is greatly lacking."
5,Great old fashioned toy,"This is a similar version of the top I had when I was a child in the 50's. Lot's of fun, low hum and changing colors."
4,Really Cool,"Even though this is the Japanese version, the only part that's not in english is the text that tells you to flip your psp sideways (like you couldn't figure it out when the screen turns 90 degrees). This game is completely awesome. It forces you to play sideways, but thats what makes it great. I've never played any other version of this, but this feels like you're playing in the arcade. It's not too challenging - you'll probably master even hard mode after playing for a few hours, but the replay value is amazing, because you'll always try for a better score.There's some bonus stuff too: you unlock boss mode and level select mode (there's a third that I haven't unlocked yet). I've played every psp game out so far, and I think this is the only game worth buying (until GTA comes out)."
3,Good Product,The item is reliable and compact but the amount of reflection is limited in the sense that the mouth of the reflector is quite small. Even using a 100 watt 6500k light bulb the amount of reflected light is not really that great. The clamp has a pivoting mechanism so the clamped is stationary but you can still move it around. i have found this feature to be quite loose and does not stay in place like in the picture. No matter how tight you fasten it it always limps and doesn't stay in place. But it is a low price item so....
3,"Works, but is not ideal","The reflector doesn't screw securely onto the base. In addition, the lamp's angle isn't adjustable enough to do what I wanted to do with it. But, I wouldn't get enough of a refund to make returning it worthwhile, so I'll try to make it work."
5,It holds a bulb,"So I don't know this product seems fine, it holds a bulb just fine. I clamped it to my bookshelf and it hasn't fallen once in the months that I have had it. The light still works."
2,Very Cheap,"This looks like it is made purposely to break within the first few months of use. The clamp doesn't hold very well, and the aluminum reflector bowl is like aluminum foil. Certainly not like the old American Made products of our childhood."
2,Not all Jinn are devils,"From my other research about the Djinn I learned that they do have free will and some have chosen good over evil. However vengeful many might be,I don't think it is fair to lump them all in a category with devils.This is a small book and it still leaves me with many questions unanswered, such as why cultures outside the middle east and maybe India have not picked up on the idea of there being a third major type of creation in addition to men and angels. Couldn't we learn to work with the Djinn as King Solomon did? We might have to be brave enough or non-judgmental enough to love them first."
4,no title,"Fascinating, quick read about people's reactions and memories of November 25, 1963, the day and hour and minute that President John F. Kennedy was shot in Texas. Written in 1968, interesting now in view of 9-11-01. Two events that mark our times."
2,Weeeellll..,I purchased it because I read so many good reviews about the suction and the suction is what I always am troubled with in these little vacs. This one was a little more powerful than others I've tried but not much. I had to go over and over the area to pick everything up and ended up giving it to my kids to try and keep their rooms clean with on their own as they can't handle the big vacuum. It DOES get hot and the attachments aren't that great either. Darn it!
4,Works like a charm,"I recently purchased this to have handy for cleaning my stair carpets. It does a good job. It fits nicely in my ""stair basket"" so it is hidden in there until I need it. Since it is electric, it has lots of power and the cord is nice and long. I do not find it too cumbersome or heavy. Does a good job. I am very pleased with it. 4 stars - attachments could be better but the brush that I basically use is good. A little loud but this can be expected with a heavy duty motor."
5,THIS THING SUCKS!!!!!!!!,"THIS COMPACT VAC' IS AMAZING! MUCH MORE POWERFUL THAN I THOUGHT.ONE REVIEW COMMENTED ON THE DIFFICULTY IN DETACHING AND REINSTALLING THE DUST CUP. IT COULDN'T BE ANY MORE SIMPLE. MY ONLY SUGGESTION TO THE MANUFACTURERER WOULD BE TO SELL A WAND SETTO COMPLIMENT THE HOSE. OTHER THAN THAT, I LOVE IT!!!!!"
3,As advertised,"It is powerful. It is small. It is convenient. The price was terrific. I just haven't yet found a good way of storing it. The cord (long, as advertised), the accessories and the unit are an unwieldly combination when it comes to deciding where or how to put it all away. In addition, cleaning the filter is a problem. The cover does not come off easily and can make a mess."
4,Powerful Little Devil!,"This is a powerful little hand vac, due entirely to its power source being plug-in versus depending on a rechargeable battery! The filter bag gets full quickly and requires cleaning often. **Getting the pieces apart and re-together for cleaning the little filter bag requires great dexterity and attention to detail: would be very difficult for children or old people.** Nevertheless, does a great job with crevices and cracks!"
4,Does a good job...,Many of the comments r true but once u get the hang of it ...this little sucker has the POWER.I can see some women struggling with it to a degree. Have a guy open and clean it if u can.I attached another section of hose I had and it makes it easier to use....Dirt Devil should consider doing this.At todays price 15$...super buy.....also good for cars.As someone stated...Dustbusters dont cut it for the real jobs.
2,not for pets,"This vacuum has a lot of suction power, but it's not effective because since the opening is so small you have to get really close to the surface to pick up anything, and when you do, the vacuum ""sticks"" to the surface because it's so strong. I have scratched up wood trying to vacuum. Also the attachments all fall off very easity, so you have to keep on putting them back on every two minutes. The main problem is that there is no rotating brush, so it won't pick up hair. The brush attachment doesn't really work for getting hair, and you have to manually ""rotate"" the brush get it to pick up any hair at all. Also since the suction is so strong, the bristles on the brush attachment get squashed, and so they work even less. I got this vac just for spot cleaning pet hair, and it's useless."
2,Powerful - Not Practical,"Great low price and it does have a lot of suction power. However when I turned it on and started using it the side vents blew hot air out so much that it was actually making more mess then it was picking up at times if I was not real careful of the position it was held in. Also, because it got so hot, there was no way I could use the strap they included so you could carry it over your shoulder when using the hose and attachments. To empty the dust cup was difficult for me. Had trouble releasing it from other half of product. Maybe it was just me I am not sure. I depressed the release button and tried and tried but it took quite some time to get it apart. Enough time that I am going to give it to someone else who wants it. I don't know if this helps, but you can't always go on just power ratings I have learned. The design of the vacuum is very important too."
5,Okay-here's the deal,"This little machine is as powerful as advertised, as I quickly found out when I let my finger stray to close to the suction. It is very light, easy to store and absolutely pulls up whatever you need it to. Yes, it is somewhat noisy, but not overly so. Yes, the ""bag"" area is small, but certainly more than adequate. The only legitmate gripe I can see is that if what you are vacuuming is predominantly dust, and by that I mean the big old ""dust-bunnies"" that can sometimes appear, the exhaust (which comes from both sides of the machine) will blow it around a bit. But you can avoid the problem altogether by using the hose that comes with it.This is the last hand held vacuum I will ever buy. When it dies, I'll get another one. The only thing better would be if it were this powerful with no cord.Last thing-I used it to vacuum my car today and it performed like a champ. If you need a hand held vacuum, this is the one."
2,Disappointing!,"Well, this was a real dissapointment for me. I have had all the other handhelds, the Dustbusters, etc, and expected a lot from this. Yes, it has good, powerful suction, but it blows so much air out of its vents that it blows the dirt out of the way before you can get to it! So frustrating! The dirt chamber is also incredibly small, meaning you have to stop and empty it every 60 seconds or so. And it it SO LOUD. It is louder than both my vacuum and my steam cleaner. The item was a cheap buy, which should have tipped me off to its quality. Sometimes you do get what you pay for, which in this instance wasn't much. Stick to a good quality Dustbuster, its worth the extra money."
2,Just A Lot of Hot Air,"The size is great but it's very noisy and the vents are too close to the intake, so all you end up doing is blowing the dirt around instead of sucking it up. Plus the attachment hose really isn't helpful at all as it falls out easily. I'm getting another Black and Decker."
2,"Good and Bad, Not worth the money.",I bought this product. First off the attachments dont stay on so when your cleaning its like all of a sudden the attachment (Hose) just falls off and you dont realize it so your wasting time putting it back on.The suction is good but its loud and the holding tank for your dust is small so you really have to empty it often.For small jobs its good but they made it so one side blows out air so if you turn the vac it will blow the dirt all over the place. I wouldnt buy another product like this.Its been in my closet for awile.For stairs I didnt find it worked well. Like I said its good for really small jobs and the attachments are a waste.Suction is the only good thing about it.
4,Need MORE power....,"This little vac is great. Power wise, it rates right up there with my 6.5 hp shop vac. The disadvantages: short hose, intake is too close to exhaust causing particals of dirt you are trying to vacuum up."
3,[Inexpensive] vac for a [good] price,"This vac is nothing to rave about. I got it for use in my car and it does a decent job. The design of the hose is not that great - it falls out easily. It's a[n inexpensive] vac, so what do you expect? I wasn't expecting much for th[e] price, so if this thing breaks in a year it'll have served its purpose. As the saying goes, you get what you pay for, so don't expect too much out of this."
5,He actually WANTS to vacuum now!,"We just got this little guy today and dont let its size fool you, it cleaned up a potted plant that the cat knocked over, plus our intire studio apartment *that hadn't been vacuumed in a month* in all of 7 minutes. The best part about it was when my boyfriend actually took it away from me and started doing it.. he just kept saying how cool it was :) The crevice tool was exspecially good for the computer desk and the keyboard! But do watch out for the exaust ((also can be used as a leaf blower lol))"
3,"3 stars, but recomended","It is a powerful little machine, as most reviewers said, but also the drawbacks they stated.Pros: It has a strong suction, inexpensive, small.Cons: Hose is a little too short and has a tendency to fall out alot. No definable place to store the cord. I wish it had clips to store the atachments insatead of storing the entire thing in the box it came with.Could be issues for you, but were not for me: It is very loud, also gets almost Hot. It has a small dust cup.Oddly enough I would still recomend it. To me the price is worth the cons, and the cons are only a minor inconviece to me. It does a very good job for what I bought it for."
3,"Recommended unit, but has several annoying design flaws","This thing has plenty of suction and is great for small cleanup jobs where you don't want to pull out a large vacuum. As others have noted, the exhaust is pretty forceful and the noise is sort of loud, but those seem like acceptable issues given what this thing gives you. Unfortunately it has two design problems that make it rather irritating. First, the extension hose does not stay in the unit very well. It needs a simple locking mechanism, which would be seemingly easy to add. Second, I dread having to put the unit back together after emptying it. Woe to the person who misses the alignment even a slight bit and ends up with the ""female"" part on top of (rather than completely over) the plastic ""male"" lock. It is a real pain to get it back open.I'll never understand how companies so often get the hard part right - in this case, a powerful inexpensive vacuum - then mess up the simplest usability steps."
2,"Good pickup and style, but awkward to hold and super heats","The Scorpion has much better vacuuming power than the little dirt devil I tried about 5 years ago. But, there are several flaws:- the dirt chamber is tiny- the attachment ends are tiny- the unit is awkward to hold while in use (especially with the included strap)- the unit get super hot super quicklyI tried using this vacuum to clean out my car's interior. While it was able to do the job, I felt the need to turn the Scorpion off for a few minutes at a time because it was getting so incredibly hot. In fact, I even tried using the neck strap to move it around because I didn't want to be burned.Next time I clean up the car, I will go through the slightly greater effort of using the full size vacuum cleaner as this little guy just has too many drawbacks."
5,Fearless Little Vac!,"I have always liked my scorpion for cleaning up bird seed around the bird cages. Yesterday I spent the day cleaning out dozens of mouse nests from my motorhome that had been in storage, This little vacuum almost made it fun! It is very powerful, lightweight, and easy to empty. Buy it!"
4,Very powerful,"This hand vacuum is incredibly powerful. I use it to clean up my cat's litter, which gets everywhere. Howerver, when I attach the attachments, the power level goes way down. And it's harder to pick up every crumb without an attachment."
1,"Maybe the Scorpion is good, but the WholesalersClub is NOT!","Don't buy this if it is being offered by the WholesalersClub. I ordered it for my dad's birthday. It does NOT ship after 1-2 business days. In fact, NINE DAYS after I ordered it, I received a message stating that it was out of stock (still shown as being available on Amazon). That wouldn't be too bad except I purchased it as a gift."
5,POWERFUL AND CHEAP!,"This is a great little vacuum for the low price. It is very powerful - and watch out for the air blowing out of the sides when you are using it. Perfect for the kitchen and bathroom, as well as those carpet edges. I didn't have any problem with the attachments, unlike some other reviewers. It's cute, too."
2,powerful but poor design,"Yes indeed this is a powerful little vacuum. However, after emptying the dirt cup it is very hard to put it back in correctly. Also, I wish the front of the machine was shaped a little flatter. The angled design makes it hard to reach certain areas where a more rectangular design might be easier. I am going to return this to the store."
2,Should have been called a leaf blower,"Yes, this vacuum has great suction and a very powerful motor. However, it is incredibly loud which I could get over if it got the job done. Unfortunately, that powerful suction is accompanied by an equally powerful exhaust. Before you can get close enough to suck dirt up, the exhaust fan has blown it across the room. The other downside is the very small dirt reservoir. You have to empty it much too frequently."
5,Fear the Bite of the Scorpion,"This baby is great. Picks up just about anything and emptying is not so difficult, once you get the hang of opening and closing the body. The exhaust on the side of the vacuum blows pretty strong so keep that side away from debris, because it will blow the dirt around. I use this instead of my large upright whenever possible. Its handy and really does the job."
3,Not enough power for me.,"It has no power at all compared to my tiny cannister vac from shop vac. The tools have very tiny openings and will not suck up large items. The other complaint is that after using it for a while, the vibration from it really bothers your hand. It is good for some specific jobs but I like my 1hp tiny shop vac much better. This will not replace it like I thought. The shop vac puts this thing to shame when it comes to suction and capacity to hold dirt. It also is not that much bigger. I bought it because of the other positive reviews on here and now I wish I would have purchased another little Shop Vac"
2,blowing sweeper,This sweeper has a lot of power and good suction for it's size. But the exhaust vents are located on BOTH sides of the sweeper body. What you are trying to sweep up gets blown into the air. I bought this with the idea of being able to clean up the cat & dog hair from my stairs but it just blows it into the air before I can get it swept up.
2,Disappointed,"I bought two of them and they were like low quality towels. Kinda like the $2 bath towels at Walmart. The material was way too thin and they left little white balls all over the place. Like I said, LOW quality towels, but they were the only robes I could find that had hoods. Oh, and definitely don't get them if you're under 5'3"" or less. I'm 5' and mine drags the ground. I would NEVER have bought them if I had seen them in the store. High price, low quality, can't get much better than that!"
1,Not happy,"I was expecting plush, thick terry cloth robes but instead got scratchy thin, lightweight material that looks like its already worn out. I knew when I got the package it wasn't going to be what I wanted- it was far too small to be holding two robes inside. I was extremely disappointed and wish I would have paid a few extra dollars for something nicer- especially when this was expensive enough! I haven't tried yet, but I'm going to wash them in a load of fabric softener to see if that will help."
3,Hoping for much better,"I had hoped that ordering from a Spa/Resort supplier I would be able to get a pretty nice hefty robe that would exceed retail store quality.The robe was ok but just ok, mostly due to the fact that it was not very thick, hefty or cozy.It was very poorly made and the stitching was incomplete with long running threads throughout the robes seams.The return process was fairly easy but offered no free postage on the return and the turn around time was acceptable.I just felt like I lost the money I paid out for S/H to and from the store (about $20.00)."
3,A little bit too thin for the price.The material was lightweight not very plush size was way too big have to return it.,A little bit too thin for the price.The material was lightweight not very plush size was way too big have to return it.
3,Saying More With Less?,"Only a couple of thoughts to add to the consensus view:1. As Brad Mehldau Trio albums go, this one is just decent, finally falling into place with some cohesiveness around tracks #5 and #6 (the two Mehldau originals), and closing out with three strong statements. It's very hard to self-produce and remain objective. Perhaps if Nonesuch EP Bob Hurwitz would insist on bringing an outsider in, the overall product might sparkle and shine a bit more, and delight more consistently from top to bottom once again.2. Wherever drummer Jorge Rossy is right about now, I hope that it's a really sweet gig. He brought much and little to the table at the same time, if you know what I mean (very much à la Paul Motian). Next thing we know, Billy Cobham will be replacing Jack DeJohnette in the Keith Jarrett Standards Trio. Rue that day while enjoying the second half of this. Tweak them stars to 3 and a half. Brad's still a monster."
5,Dave's Heir Apparent,"Finally! I've been so hopeful that Brad was going to mature into the heir apparent to Dave Brubeck as a Piano Jazz GOD! After hearing ""She's Leaving Home"", I'm finally convinced! Thank you Brad!"
3,Wrong color,"I ordered a ""Hunter green"" colored knife and I received a black one. I am disappointed.It's not worth shipping it back just for the color error. This is the first time Amazon has let me down."
2,It was the wrong model.,"I was disappointed. I thought I was buying the model with the light. I spent a lot of time researching the correct model and yet ended up ordering the wrong one. I bought two knives, I wanted both of them to be the same model with the light."
2,You get what you pay for,It is an inexpensive product so the quality is not the best. It is so hard to plug into my mp3 player & ever harder to pull out.
5,Prompt problem solver,I was pleased to find this replacement for a lost cable at a reasonable price. Prompt shipment. Worked like the original.
3,It's Purple,"A well made shirt, good quality all around, except . . .The photo shows a blue shirt, but the actual shirt is purple. Guess It'll go in the drawer with the rest of the purple shirts.I wish they would specify a color so thet this does not continue to happen."
5,Great gift!,The 12 year old girl that received this as a gift for her birthday loved it. She is a big fan of penguins.
2,Not as good as advertised...,After reading the reviews on this shirt I figured it was a must buy for my dad's birthday. Unfortunately I was wrong. He hated the shirt. He said he hasn't worn tie-dye since he stopped doing hard drugs and threw the shirt right into the Salvation Army donation bag we have in the basement. My dad's a really cool guy so he knows a good shirt when he sees one. I think everyone should mark the other reviews as unhelpful because they sure didn't help me get dad a birthday gift. I wouldn't recommend this item to anyone getting a birthday gift for their dad. There seem to be a lot cooler animal print shirts out there.
5,Arkon SR052 Satellite Radio Holer,"This is an excellent product for holding satellite receivers. The suction cup is very strong and stays in place. It's easy to install and it's versatile. Comes with a peel and stick base for mounting on a dashboard. I mounted it right to the windshield and it scarcely vibrates at all. In order to reduce vibration even further, I bent the arm so that the receiver rests on the dash itself.I fully recommend this holder."
5,Sat Radio Mount,"Works extremly well, even better if you are not trying to take it off the windshield as it hold really well.Overall it works extremly well at an excellent price."
3,decent product,for the amount of money paid.. this is a decent product.The suction cup does loose its grip from time to time but its not a big issue. I only worry that I have damaged the radio when it falls.
5,I LOVE my new pots & pans!!,"These pots & pans are FABULOUS! Not only do they look great & match my mixer perfectly, they perform spectacularly! The non-stick is, of course, an absolute breeze to clean up, and I couldn't be happier with this set. I highly recommend this set for its performance and excellent value... I'd happily buy them again (o:"
1,Bears air mattress,This air mattress fell apart within 3 hours after being inflated. The plastic was brittle and splitting along the seams. I can't seem to learn my lesson about using Amazon for books and CDs only.
5,4.5 Really good,"I really dig this CD. Its the first i have bought by them so i have to go back and get the older, 'heavier' stuff i suppose.Best way to describe this is laid back yet heavy music. Vocally, its crystal clear and soothing. The melodies are beautiful. It is progressive i suppose, but i just think its exceptional mood music. The tracks 'Maybe?' and 'Alone' are exceptional.Being a new fan i would recommend this CD highly. I plan on also getting their DVD that came out not long ago. I saw a few clips on You Tube and it has a really cool vibe. A very talented 'band' (i use the term loosely based on line up changes) and one that i plan on looking into further.According to their web site, for the time being they are no more. That is sad, because they truly had something original to offer."
4,A comeback in my books.,"I loved Light of Day, Day of Darkness. After that the last two cds I couldn't get into. They have been heading in a new direction so don't expect what you've heard before. This cd resembles the band Anathema. Doesn't quite touch their caliber but this cd is a worth attempt of something new."
4,Good audio quality. Tight on the ears and link mic is weak.,"The audio quality and the noise cancelling of these headphones is great. However, they are tight on the ears which can lead to discomfort. Also, the microphone in the ""link"" cable for a cellphone is fairly weak. I had to physically hold it at my mouth before the other party could hear me well."
4,Good value for the $,"Pros:1. Seems to be well constructed ... time will tell!2. Good sound quality3. Equally good noise canceling capabilities....if you're looking for tomb-like silence, then you'll be better off with industrial strength sleep medication. No NC headphones are 100% sound insulating (which is a good thing)4. Works in standard (i.e. non NC) mode even without batteriesCons:1. Takes 2 AAA batteries (and not 1 AA as mentioned in the product description)2. A little tight around the ears -- probably need to get used to it3. While the 'skull cap' style bag looks avant garde enough for a high school teenager, I would have preferred a more solid travel kit ... common guys, it can't be THAT much more expensive!"
5,the perfect BEGINNER yoga tape,"I own 4 different beginner yoga tapes and this is by far the best because it really IS intended for beginners. It moves VERY slowly and takes you step by step through the poses. Lilias' personality is gentle and appealing, without perky phoniness. There is gentle, soft music in the background which doesn't detract. She sometimes gives alternative instructions to make a pose easier on the body if one has physical challenges. In companion with her beginner morning workout tape these are the best on the market. I recommend them for any beginner, not necessarily only the mature adults for which they were intended."
5,Everthing you could want to know........,"This is the most comprehensive account of artillery during the Napoleonic wars I think you could hope to read (if anyone has an alternate please do review and add reference). It is a lucid and at times exciting account of the use of artillery. I think it has covered every major action of the period including some I hadn't heard of.Not only does the book cover the engagements well, it also provides great technical details - even down to sample artillery tables from the period. Lavish illustrations are provided with descriptions of contemporary tools.There are plenty of books on Cavalry and Infantry for this period, but their scope is far less ambitious than this work. Often by battle, country, tactical and strategic etc. The scope of this work is very ambitious, every aspect of an entire combat arm for multiple countries during a key period of history - the author has produced a great book."
5,Great reference,This is a great reference for anyone working with rope. It's well written with clear illustrations. What I found most valuable was the wealth of safety information. Highly recommended.
4,"Must have for any climber ... but,","""On Rope"" is an excellent background resource. However, since it was published there have been several important advances in equipment and techniques that should warrant a new revised edition."
5,Cool but consider getting the first edition too...,"I bought this book to learn vertical caving and teach Venture Crew members. The local Grotto helped. We hoped to learn Prusiking (3 knot rope ascending), but the details in the second edition aren't as good as the 1st edition. The Grotto guy sent me some photo copies of the first edition that clarified stuff in the second addition.I now own both additions. This is a must have if you do vertical caving or want to do vertical caving. The window washing info, and circus rigging is cool but I don't think we will rig a trapeze any time soon... Talk around, perhaps the 1st addition is for you!"
2,So hokey!,This is almost a satiric movie. It reminds me of the scary movie series! But it is no where near as funny!
2,Corny Bad!,"One of those movies that is so bad, it's funny. The acting is one big ham sandwich. The storyline is simple.The ""Killer Klowns"" are so ugly the makeup man should be in jail. Yet, I kept watching."
5,BEAUTIFUL SHOES & SUPER COMFORTABLE!!!!,I bought Tsubo Men's Xeric because I saw nice style to my husband.....I can't believe he always dicover something wrong is hard to buy shoes to him because he has wide flat feet...but he said that thi sshoes are the best very comfortable to walk and he wanted other pair in different color and using the promotional buy $80 and get $20 off I bought this pair Zaurek nice shoes and light weight and the style is more serious than sport.I recommend 100% buy this shoes!!!
2,Don't judge a book by it's Title,"I've been using Photoshop for many years and bought this book looking for complex techniques and insight. I hate to disagree with the other reviews, but the book's title is misleading. (Please note that this is just my opinion)! I think the ""trickery"" examples in this book are somewhat basic and anyone with a general understanding of Photoshop (and a bit of creativity) can produce better results.Although the topics and ideas in this book may ""wow"" beginners, advanced users should look elsewhere. At most, ""intermediate"" would describe this title better!"
2,Poorly written with unclear directions in tutorials,"As a college student, I took a class that used this book as our manual. The content of the book covered several great features of Adobe Photoshop, but much of it was limited to very repetitive steps that are used consistently throughout the book.Many of my classmates complained that it was difficult to follow the directions and that in some cases, steps were missing that were illustrated in the following step. I even saw where one tutorial didn't even specify the dimensions when creating a new scene. In other cases, it requires the use of a nik Color Efex demo that was included on the CD-ROM, which I couldn't get any of the nik effects to work. Why would you want to be trained on third party plugins anyway? The book is supposed to be about Photoshop, not expensive plugins that the author favors.Thus I dock the book three stars for lack of instruction, it's detour from the subject, and difficulty following steps."
1,Just terrible!,"Right out of the gate I found so many missing steps that, after double and triple checking to make sure I hadn't missed anything, I still found myself scrambling to get the intended results of the lessons. I'm not a complete novice when it comes to Photoshop, but I'm not an expert either. My hope was that this book would help take me to the next level. Unfortunately, the author assumes that the reader has already attained expert status and fails to include some general instructions that are far from obvious. Three thumbs down. (You can do that with Photoshop!)"
4,A fine acoustic offering.,"The 2nd album by Marc Teamaker and may I say a very fine album from the songs to the production. The voice that lifts and calms within 2 songs is what makes this album so strong. ""Ocean Bound"" has country twinges to it with it's pedal steel guitar (or is it lap steel?... whatever), ""Starfish Salamander"" is an upbeat feel good song, the album is just a must hear for those that like good music. I'd seriously think about it, although his newest and self-titled album is a step forward from this, don't let that turn you off as this album is just as good but in a different league.Check it out!"
1,Very Poor Quality,This product is not worth the money. The glass is very thin and lightweight. It should be at least as thick as glass jars used for food products. Also there was a defect on the rim.The silicone dipper is very nice. It well constructed BUT the seal on the end does not fit the glass jar. It is loose. If it had a sturdy glass jar that the dipper sealed into this product would be rated higher.Bottom Line: I would not recommend this product to a friend nor give it as a gift.
1,Worked great until it broke...,"We loved this honey jar because it kept the honey from crystallizing for a good amount of time. Then one day the parts of the lid came unglued and alas, all the honey crystallized! Wah wah wah. Not worth the money."
3,you get what you pay for,"RSVP Endurance Jar with Silicone Dipperconsidering the price its fine, but the jar is lightweight. the more expensive ones have sturdier jars that have ridges so you don't see the crystalized honey smears."
2,It stars leaking after 2-3 months,"It is a great invention, especially if you have pets, but you get what you pay for. For the first 2-3 months it works great, then it starts leaking the dirty water back onto the carpet when you least expect it. You have to turn it off and if you try it again in a few days sometimes it works and sometime it starts leaking again."
5,Very pleased,The steam cleaner does a great job. We are very pleased. It might not work well to do large houses but it is great for doing small areas at a time. Love it!
2,Leaks,I puchased the Dust Devil Easy Steamer less than one year ago. I have only used it 3 or 4 times and am now looking for a replacement. The unit started leaking during the second use and continues to leak from the clean water tank - leaving pools of water saturating the carpet. It also leaves carpet wet for at least a day. I am not very happy with this purchase and will do a little more research when I purchase a replacement.
5,Lightweight extractor that gives a heavy weight perfrmance!,"I have had this item for a little over a month. My dog comes in from the back yard on rainy days and tracks mud inside the house. The carpet takes a beating and I can wait a week and then spot clean. That's a light weight job. Recently, my cat became deathly ill. I discovered some really bad excretions that must have sat over a month behind a sofa in a room I rarely enter. This extractor got it right out. I used an entire tank and it took some time, but the end result was VERY satisfactory. My carpet is brand new and I was worried. Now the actual cleaning solution doesn't get the job done with ANY extractor in my opinion. I prefer to add a little liquid laundry detergent. I don't recommend this to you, because it will make your warranty invalid. However, I think adding a tablespoon of detergent (LIQUID!!) and hot water works VERY well. Anything over a tablespoon or two will cause a sudsy overflow and clog the system."
2,Only good for small jobs,"Don't be fooled into thinking that this will clean your carpet as thoroughly as a professional. It is good on small clean ups.CONS: Leaks, doesn't suck up water and leaves carpet wet all day, difficult to clean up.Pass on this one."
2,Dirty carpet outlasts the motor!,"This steamer worked very well on my carpet, but given the infrequent times i had to use it and how quickly the motor burned out (less than two years), i'd have to recommend something else or a service warranty. I was spoiled with how well it removed stains and brightened my carpets, but i assume that since i was using it on large areas during extended periods of time, that may be the culprit for the engine going so quickly."
1,Trash,"I've had this cleaner for about three years now as a replacement . Primarily, I had bought it because it is small and light-weight. Unfortunately, I have been very disappointed with my purchase as the quality of the cleaner is just a little too low. It leaks everywhere: the screwcap of the canister cannot be screwed on correctly to seal it, the seal between thecanister and the main unit constantly leaks and I have not been able to fix it, the coupling between the main unit and the upholstery attachment leaks, and finally, the waterhose that leads to the handle of the upholstery attachment also leaks and can't be stopped. Needless to say, whenever I decide to give it a new chance, this thing repeatedly fails me. On top of all that, the main hose of the upholstery attachment broke after only two uses.I will make sure to avoid Dirt Devil in the future."
5,"Don't pass on this one. Great price, Great cleaner.","I own rental property and bought a top of the line carpet cleaner. During three years of use pieces broke off, suction hoses got clogged and then finally the main hose snapped in half. It was loud and heavy to lug. After reading reviews, I bought the Dirt Devil today and have just finished cleaning 4 rooms of carpet. I am so happy. I paid a third of what the top of the line Bissell model cost me. It is quieter, lighter to carry around and cleans even better. Yes, you have to empty the fill tank frequently, but that is better than lugging all that heavy water around with every push. Besides it is so simple to empty, it takes only a few seconds. This machine was engineered beautifully. There are no wasted parts to break down, plus it cleans up easily. From someone who has been cleaning rental units for over 15 years, I'm content with this cleaner."
2,Good points and some not so good points!,"I've had this cleaner sinc 1/00. The motor burned up 3/01, and the warranty was no problem to use. The motor was replaced and today the motor burned up, again. However, it is out of warranty. I use the cleaner about 4x a year for a 1500 sq ft house. I was very disappointed in the life of the unit. Also the release trigger for the solution would stick in the 'open' position and dispense all the solution at one time.The positive points are the unit is light weight. It is easy to assemble, and easy to clean up."
4,Dirt Devil Easy Steamer,"I have one of these and...I have bought several others, including one from another big manufacturer, which I am returning today, because I was very unhappy with it. I highly recommend this for its ease of use, ability to remove stains easily and quickly with high-powered extraction, and price. A+"
5,Great read for young Hispanics.,"I recently read First Day in Grapes to my second grade class. They were engaged by the story of Chico and his experiences in yet another new school. Half of my kids came up to me afterward and told me they ""loved"" this story. They made a lot of connections with an Hispanic character and many could relate to moving around. I would recommend this book highly to teachers and others who value a story with a meaningful moral."
1,Junk...,"the film is okay, but the dvd is a bootleg. The image has simply been stolen from the Hong Kong dvd, and not well I might add. The film is owned by Dragon Dynasty in the US and should be coming out in the next year or so. If you want to support theif and poor bootleg DVDs, feel free to throw your support behind this one. If you have to see the film, get a region free dvd player for $40 and the world is your oyster! You can get most HK dvds of the Shaw Brothers films for around $10 INCLUDING shipping."
1,Wack movie,im a huge kung fu movie fan and bottom line is this wasnt good...i thought it was going to be a classic....after i watched it i threw the dvd in the garbage...nuff said
2,Bad box of reeds!!!,"Unfortunately, this box of reeds was not up to my liking. Three out of the five reeds were not usable. Very unsatisfied!!"
4,Bad Shipping,"When mixer was packaged for shipping, the lock lever that locks the head down was left in the unlocked position, resulting in the molded foam shipping protection being beat into small pieces, so far the mixer has worked.Mixer head was allowed to swing up and down during shipping due to faulty packing!!"
5,1998 Jaguar XKR Convertible,"This little diecast model is well made and has the bonus of looking just like our car. Same colors, wheels and model just an older year but they all look the same.Well made, the doors, trunk, and hood all open. The steering even works!"
2,"Kind of cheap, even for price.","This hair dryer is adequate, but nothing special. It has only two heat settings, and the base/holder is flimsy plastic. Having the holder is why I bought it--no more cords on the bathroom counter--but it's not a very sophisticated hairdryer. Note also that the plug-adapter will cover both outlets."
2,"Not great, and why is listed as a kitchen accessory?","I have used this dryer when we travel to hotels, where it installed as a guest convenience.First, I have to wonder why the item is listed at Amazon as a kitchen accessory...Uh, do you want people blow-drying their hair in YOUR kitchen?Back to QUALITY...this dryer is very limited in its drying ability, and has limited settings. It is also on the flimsy side, and is rather toy-like. Unless you have a crew-cut, you'd better plan on taking a long time to dry your lovely long tresses."
3,wall mount hair dryer,I wanted an inexpensive wall-mounted hair dryer with some power.This unit meet all expected criteria. However the wall mount case is pretty thin and flimsy.
3,Light works,Clamps are terrible. My bolts broke on first use- very poorly made.You can buy one of these at your local hardware store- for less and no shipping
4,Perfect for Dark Corner,I gave this to my mother as a gift and she says it works extremely well and she is delighted with it. It illuminates a dark corner and swivels to light each area that she wants to see.
2,Deceptive..not based on Christian principles,"The title IS very deceptive. I bought the book thinking it was going to help me see life diffrently, it didnt. The author seems to be using the word ""God"" to get the attention of a christian audience and thats about all. Relates ""god winks"" to divorce, and walking out of a marriage. Last time I checked God wasnt a proponet of those things. The author uses these as examples to reprsent a change in life that God is promoting.. The book does have u think about conicidences a little more, and might have u think more deeply into them, but thats about all. I would NOT reccomend this book to a new christian or a struggling christian. It takes all the focus onto the individual and not God. The only thing good about the book is that it is a quick read, and offers interesting stories every now and then. Beware..dont be fooled!"
4,GoD Winks,I purchased this book for gifts and everyone truly enjoyed them. How many times in your life have you ever said Wow what a Coincidence? God has things all lined up for us if we pay attention! This was an uplifting and comforting little book. Enjoy!
2,Cliche and unrealistic but mildly interesting at times,"The biggest problem I had with this book is that the author seemed to pick and choose people who's lives had worked out. All of the examples he used were very famous names - Oprah, Bill Clinton, etc. To me, it felt very contrived. Granted, it was mildly interesting to learn things about the famous people and how they got to where they were.I would have liked to hear about every day people who made it when all seemed lost. To the every day reader, it's not realistic that they're going to get a movie deal while exercising at the gym or be president of the United States (sorry for the reality check). I didn't find this book enlightening or encouraging. It's more of an extension of People magazine."
4,No Coincidences,"I have always recognized the events the author describes as ""God winks"" in my life. Reading the book has made me even more aware and now I have a name for them! This book will cause you to see the ""coincidences"" in your life quite differently, if you are a person of faith. I recommend it for the paradigm shift it can produce as you begin to recognize the ""God incidents"" that occur in your life with regularity."
5,Awesome Book!,This book will really open your eyes to God's influence in your daily life. Read it! It is a short book. Well worth it. I guarantee you that it will help increase your faith.
4,Everything Happens For A Reason,"I enjoyed this quick read. I did skip over a few chapters that I didn't feel were pertinent to me, but still really enjoyed this book. If you are looking to see if you are on the right path in life, read God Winks. And then, start paying attention, you'll be surprised at what comes to mind!"
1,Please!!,"Way too far fetched. Stopped reading it. Wish I had not bought it. I am a spiritual,person and believe good and great things happen. But some of these were ridiculous. Like the minister and the roadside phone ringing and being for him."
2,When God Winks,I'm not impressed with the book. I know that nothing happens by conincidence but I think this book is over the top. I have not completed it and don't know if I will.
3,Romantic but not research based,"Malcolm Gladwell covers the subject from the psychological perspective in, Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking; while Squire Rushnell covers the subject from a supernatural standpoint. Although Rushnell's piece is certainly more romantic, the antithesis is so much more grounded in research."
2,"When An Author ""Phones It In""","It sounded like an in-depth treatment of the spiritual dynamics of so-called coincidences. It read like the one-page fodder from an old Reader's Digest. Seriously, this is a few anecdotal tales, and some of them aren't really interesting.Caveat emptor."
5,When God Winks: How the Power of Conicidence Guides Your Life,I cannot review this book as it was purchased as a gift. It was recommended highly by a friend.
2,Too much saccharine,"I know it's hard to be disparaging of a book like this, but the author believes that God has an active interest in ensuring that Ruth's steak house becomes a nationwide franchise or that Don Knotts is ushered into television. Let's be honest: God answers prayers and moves people to fulfill his purpose--not to make sure they are successful in business. God is in the whisper and not in the whirlwind. Prayer and faith do work, but a work like this reduces God to a fairy godmother out to ensure Cinderella gets to the ball and married to the prince."
4,a mind opener experience,"This book was a mind opener to anyone who is looking for meaning in situations that don't make sense. This is a new idea that all the little coincidenses that add up to events in your life come together. This book was very interesting, and gave alot of advice on how to see your own winks. I recommend this book to all ages."
5,WHEN GOD WINKS AT YOU,THIS BOOK IS A GREAT SPIRIT LIFTER. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS BOOK AS A GIFT FOR ANYONE WANTING TO SHARE SOME INSPIRATION. IT IS A SHORT READ AND WELL WORTH THE TIME
5,"Wink, Wink","So refreshing to give God the glory for all things! I hope that all who read this book, might truly see, that we are not alone. Thanks be to SQuire for providing insight into God's active presence in each of our lives. I pray that each of us have His winks revealed, such that we change our world for the better."
3,Holds some good points - just not that eye-opening,"When God Winks (4-CDs): I have mixed reactions here. I will preface this by saying - I struggle with being too negative of a person. The key focus of this book is 'Coincidences' and being positive and upbeat. I just find most of the information - well I react to most of it with 'Oh - that's nice'. And this author who reads this book aloud is a bit too over the top with his enthusiasm. - As in (not a true example there - but-) ""And then --- he drank the whole glass of water!!!!!!!!!"" WOW!! Or my reaction ""ZZZzzzz!"" This gentleman is a positive soul - and his efforts are well meant - I'm just not a holy-roller and that is who I think would love this CD. Squire can get excited about almost any topic, comment or moment. I can take this author over any negative person any day - I listened to it once - and that is more than enough for me. Scott MacNeil"
4,When God winks,"Great book. Makes you realize there are no mistakes, everything does happen for a reason. NOw when I look back I can see a pattern of how certain things progressed to bring me where I am today. Its very cool. Also helps you except the things in life you wish didnt happen, knowing there the is a reason behind everything."
3,If you want to delve deeper,"I liked this book simply because it reaffirmed the faith I already have in the power of coincidence and because I've seen it work in my life as well as in other people's lives. If you enjoyed this, but wanted to delve further, I would recommend reading The Celestine Prophecy books. These books, through fictional tales, show you the importance of paying attention to coincidence. More often than not if you feel a connection to something or someone there will or is a reason for it. Just be courageous enough to explore it and keep yourself open to looking for the lessons new introductions and situations can teach you."
3,Cerebral Pablum,"Interesting libro, a bit too much on the esoteric side. Along the lines of Dale Carnegie and that ilk. Positive thinking and all. Author makes it seem as one has coincidence happen consistently in life. It's a stretch, but a fun read nonetheless. Give it a try...price is right!"
5,God Winks,"This is a great and fun read! Love the short snippet God wink stories, I allow myself one story a day so it will last!"
2,Very beginners guide simple things to write about,"Sorry,This is not embedded systems. There is far too little usefulinformation related to embedded linux and more on higher levelissues. I cannot give this book to a software engineer andhave him(her) make a transition from hosted to embedded evenin Linux -"
1,not enough info to be usefull,"the book does not contain enough information to be usefull. I would recommend other books such as ""building Embedded Linux Systems"""
3,Device drivers for embedded linux,"Part I ('Getting Started') is a head start for newbie, but the emphasis is more on setting up a development anddebugging environment for an embedded linux project and not on the process of porting linux for an embedded system.None of the issues related to the porting of kernel loader or porting of the actual kernel for any of the reference targetboards are addressed.Not enough information for a newbie trying to port linux for a custom board.After getting past these issues (with help from resources on web) and having a working kernel on the board, Part II ('Interfacing')of the book is quite useful."
2,Mostly about interfacing,"With over 200 of the 400 pages dedicated to interfacing, it seems the emphasis of the title should have reflected this. A more appropriate title would be ""Interfacing in an example embedded Linux application"". There are many pages of entire listings which could have been made available for download instead.Although the hardware diagrams are appreciated, they are not specific to Linux. Overall, you may find the examples useful, but you will need to dig deeper to understand the real issues."
5,Most Excellent Introduction and Objective Methodology,"Dr. Hollabaugh has certainly shed useful light on the concept of embedded linux. He intelligently sets the stage and walk you through real steps for deploying a fully embedded linux control and monitoring system. The diagram, table, and code examples will leave you with a very clear understanding of the subject matter (providing you have some background with linux development). Personally, I was totally captivated and found myself extremely happy that I have chosen this book to help thrust foward my own intelligence of embedded linux. This book and website....has become a primary reference for future embedded linux application."
2,A long ago purchase,"I bought this a long time ago. I don't know what I was thinking. The book sucks. Religious propaganda. If you're interested or just fascinated by the dark side this book is written by religious fanatic. I personally do not believe that beings, entities, creatures, demons or what ever they might be are evil just because they are from the dark. We are all equal. All know good and are all capable of evil. Religion is brainwashing."
4,Not Bad Female Fronted Hard Rock,"I'd always heard this was their best album, but I prefer Get It On Credit. However, this is still good music. They have a much harder edge than Heart, who they are always compared with. As a whole, the album is quite enjoyable. However, after several listens, there are no songs that really stand out to me. Still, I could listen to this over and over again.As a good representation of this underrated band, I highly recommend it."
3,sort of a step back after their first album,"Pretty much unknown band Toronto is like Pat Benatar, Suzi Quatro, Ellen Foley, Heart, Quarterflash, Toni Basil, and Scandal all rapped up in one. But following their 1980 album Lookin For Trouble, which showed great promise for this female fronted band of the 80s, this follow-up seems to lack the melodic hooks of the first album and while catchy, it is not a particularly memorable album. Instead of capturing the more progressive rock sounds of the 80s, this album actually seems to be more late 70s in its vibe, with a kind of bar band sound. The only real standout for me that truly captures the essence of female artists of the 80s is the song Black Mail. But really, the best was yet to come from this 80s band..."
3,solid characters and a good story,"Everyone knows what has to happen in this miniseries, but the question is how will Martok get his planet back and who will have to die in the process? It was a bit surprising if not shocking who was killed in this installment. I just thought that the Star Trek authors would find some other interesting things to do with those characters. I never knew that Martok had any children, so that was interesting to read. I found the story of Pharh (the Klingon raised Faringi) rather touching and his relationship with Martok was one of the best parts of the whole book.I don't know, but I thought that Klingons never smiled. If Kingons aren't supposed to smile, then this book isn't consistent with the Kilingon personality.In a nutshell this was a good book, but not all that engaging or maybe I just wasn't that interested in it out of the anticipation of the next book in the series ""Unity""."
5,Move over Peter David..best Star Trek book in a long time,I'd like to see Hertzler and Lang write more of these epics with Klingons or any other part of the franchise. This is what Trek is about; action and adventure and learning a bit about the human condition. The conclusion of this book sets up the next one in the series called Unity...if only Hertzler and Lang wrote that one....
4,"A web development book, not all ASP","If your looking for straight ASP don't buy this book. This book spends a big chuck on HTML, then SQL (just straight SQL not via ASP pages), and it explores VBScript and JScript. It makes a nice over-all reference book but it would be disapponting if ASP is all you wanted. I look at this book as part one of two. The next book to get is Active Server Pages 2.0 Unleashed. ASP 2.0 book ignores all the basics of this first ASP book and dives into the fun stuff. But if your new to ASP and VBScript definitely get the Active Server Pages Unleashed book first. This book is probably my number one reference book as it covers a lot of material."
3,One of the best in ASP,This is book is very useful for the beginners. If you want to start ASP for the first time means surely this book will do all for you.
1,A poor book of ASP,"if you need HTML, javascript, cgi or etc... this is your book, but if you need ASP, it's NO."
4,VERY good launch pad into ASP.,"Before this book I had a basic understanding of what Active Server Pages were, but no experience emplementing them. With this book I was able to handle all the database integration I needed for my project. Everything in the book is geared toward MS SQL 6.5, so if you are using something else, you have to remember to use 'INSERT INTO' instead of just 'INSERT' like the book says. Aside from some other small anomilies like this, it is an excelent resource. I highly recomend."
3,Good overview of ASP and web technologies,"As mentioned in other reviews, this isn't really a book about ASP. In fact, page 426 begins ""This chapter formally introduces you to Active Server Pages."" Page 426! The preceding pages cover installing servers, SQL, html, VBScript, and JScript. All of this is good (and the book was very worthwhile to me), but the title is missleading."
4,Great reference for this technology,"As a professional Web developer, I like my books to be organized in a more 'reference' oriented manner, and this book achieves just that! Geared toward the beginner/intermediate level, I find this book to cover most areas of ASP I need to reference, and complements my Visual Basic 6.0 book very well. If I need an asnwer, I can find it there! The only problem I have with the book is that it gets a little long winded in covering SQL, however for one who is not very proficient in SQL, this could be a great asset."
3,Good reference book for general information but too long.,"I am an intermediate developer that needed a reference book for ASP. This book has been helpful but it is far too long. The first 200 pages are unnecessary. It's basic HTML and web intro that you should already know if you are attempting ASP. There are other better books for reference out there, but it looks good on the shelf."
1,"One thousand pages of overviews, and just a a few of ASP","If you really want an ASP book, don't buy this one. It takes too much time talking about everithing, and doesn't give us what we really need: ASP."
2,Poor quality video and sound!,"The Victory at Sea series is a great series, but I don't recommend this particular DVD set, it is a poor quality copy.I also own the series on VHS (ISBN 0-7806-0899-2) and the video and sound quality are both much better than on this DVD.The DVD set includes two double sided DVDs and nothing else. There is no index of the Volumes or Episodes, only DVD 1, side A. Not very user friendly for finding your favorite episodes. The VHS set has the tapes listed by volume and lists the title and content of each episode.Buy the VHS version or look for a different DVD version."
4,Russian language learning made easy! for busy people.,"Used these 2 audio cassettes and accompanying booklet to learn some basic Russian while driving to and from work for three months. Never had much time to read, just mostly to listen. The problem is from time to time the words are difficult to understand and there is no phonetic spelling in the booklet to aid you...therefore you must still have a knowledge of the Cyrillic alphabet."
1,Save yourself the trouble ...,... and don't order these tees unless you insist on using a brand new tee with every drive; these tees will break every time you hit.
1,Prefiero de plástico,"Estoy empezando a jugar Golf. Estos Tee no me gustaron, se quiebranmás rápido que los de plástico. No los recomiendo."
4,The Son,"I found it interesting that a man, who hated the boy who killed his son, could have a change of heart after meeting him, and tutoring him for a while. The Son is is a compelling story of inner emotions."
3,Forgiveness or Revenge? 3.5 Stars .....,"Olivier, a wood shop teacher reluctantly takes on a new pupil, only to find that the kid is one who murdered his own son years ago. The apprentice is blithely unaware of this background, after having spent 5 years in a juvenile center. He looks up to the teacher as a trade tutor and even asks him to become his guardian.As Olivier drives the two of them out to a remote lumber yard, the viewer wonders what impulse will prevail - revenge or forgiveness. This is a suspenseful movie that may not be everyone's cup of tea, due to the flat expression of the main character and the lack of a tidy resolution."
1,Students will hate this,"I bought this on the strength of reviews I'd read, and added it to a film library for students to watch outside school hours. Not only did my family find it boring in previewing it, the students absolutely despised it. Despite high production values and good acting, there's not much story, not much action....basically, not worth watching or buying."
3,Dated but still a good read,"Written by one of Campbell's Analog ""golden age"" authors, this is a tale of US/Russian conflict that continues in the remnants of civilization. It is good old fashioned space opera-a little neive and dated but full of action with a sprinkling of humor. This story has an ""aw shucks"", hillbilly flavor, that is a nice constrast to many of the ""angst"" ridden novels written today.To my mind, this is the least of Anvil's works. His Horsip (Pandora's Planet)and Space Patrol (Strangers in Paradise and Worlord's World) stories are much more enjoyable and would appeal to readers of James Schmidt, H. Beam Piper, or Sharon Lee/Steven Miller."
1,In no working order,"I bought 2 watches and neither is in working order.Guess they both outdated and have been delivered while they dont have working batteries .I bought both of them as absolutly new in the original boxes and they should be working but they are not.Attention ,anyone who buys this item !It must have been standing on the shelfes for ages and nobody bothers to look at them before sending to the buyer."
1,Bad Book,"I take this professor at UVa, good guy, good professor but the book is poorly written. A pain to read and doesnt make much sense, Poor english is used. Dont buy this book"
3,An adequate text,"I used the Willingham text for my cognition course. At first I was delighted to find an author who attempted to frame the content of cognitive psychology as simple questions, devoid of jargon, the importance of which could be easily grasped by students. As the semester went on however, I found that the students found the text tedious and confusing. I feel that this was due to the lack of explicitly connecting the specific concepts back to the general theme of the chapter. Furthermore, his descriptions of certain experiments were outright confusing and ambiguously described, even to me. I think the approach is admirable- but the goal hasnt been reached yet. I look forward to the next edition, and hope I can once again use the text."
3,No LiveType information,"This book, while quite good, doesn't contain any help in regard to using LiveType. Just thought people should be aware of this important fact."
2,Proud of loud,"2 1/2If short, manic indie pop is your thing, the constantly blaring Reatard may fit your bill, though I rarely see past a folksier Andrew WK in the songwriting department."
4,Read it before,"Unfortunately I've read this exact book before. I still enjoyed it and a few years later it is better than before. I thought this was a newer book but apparently not. It's actually copyright 2005 and Amazon says its from 2010. That's not accurate and I would like my money back for that reason alone, since I've already purchased the book before at a different vendor. It's false advertising. Other than that though, I really enjoyed the book. I did skip several pages, one periodically but that's just me. Others might find some of the things I skipped interesting but unless they're arguing or holding a conversation I don't need pages of details about other things. It did seem though at times like Sebastian was slipping into other characters Monroe has written but I still enjoyed his growth in different aspects and I liked that they had something before things went to hell and then again later."
3,The Greek innocents virgin,This book was okay. In the beginning I liked author Lucy Monroe books but this story I don't care for. Male w too arrogant and female too simple. The second story of the series is a great book
4,"A good but difficult story, full of angst",I enjoyed this book despite the difficulties both the H and h faced. She was the daughter of a truly awful woman and he was reluctant to trust her and treat her differently to her mom. She falls pregnant after their short affair and predictably runs off but has to contact the H when her health suffers during the pregnancy. I think the story that follows was well worth reading.
5,Girl who stands her ground,"*slight spoilers throughout*The conflict is believable and very sympathetic- it's issues of trust, honesty, and assumptions in a relationship. Rachel, when faced with ugly assumptions and accusations from Sebastian, doesn't beg or plead or try to hang on to him. She leaves, and the only reason he ever finds her is because she contacts him for the sake of their baby. She hangs him out to dry for not trusting her, and she should. In the end, you do believe that she loves Sebastian, and that he really does love her.One of the parts that I find highly amusing is when Sebastian arranges their marriage more or less without asking her- because when she calls it off, he's so confused. Though Rachel clearly doesn't know yet, as the reader I got the idea that he was making grand gestures to show his feelings, and just was very flummoxed as to how to convince her."
2,Not recommended,"Loved ready, willing and able, those are three great books, what is up with these? Not so great."
4,Tastes Great,"... KLB puts on an excellent live show. The cd is solid from start to finish. My only criticism would be that they are much better live than on record (I defy you to name a local female artist, other than Ann Wilson, that can match Kerry in belting out songs) . I eagerly anticipate their next album while giving a thumbs up to ""What Remains""."
4,Worth Shipping Across The Atlantic,"I've had this disc for a while now and really enjoy it. As one of the other reviewers said, it is fun to introduce other people to it. I would definitley recommend it!I'm looking forward to catching a live show someday (hopefully very soon!)"
5,The KLB will enhance your life!,"The Kerry Lauder Band is a collective of unique, talented musicans who successfully deliver solid rhythms and share real life experiences in their premier album ""What Remains"". Consider soul touching, insightful lyrics delivered with a sleek and sexy female voice, include an electric violin, add infective bass and percussion grooves, and you have the Kerry Lauder Band, a.k.a. the KLB. Some may say the KLB sounds folk because of Kerry Lauder's tight acoustic tempo, some will say they have an eclectic international feel, but no matter how you characterize their music, these Pacific North Westerners will audibly illustrate the beauty of life and will groove you to no end. The dream is true, multiplied by two, the KLB and you-- belong together!"
4,off on the right foot,"a good sound to this band, and the potential for blowing a whole new scene wide open in seattle. get the cd and catch the live set as it is very powerful and emotional. testify."
2,"Two for Potential, Zero for music","Kerry Lauder is a typical Seattle musician, writing typical DIY girl-with-acoustic-guitar music. This album (and her live show) lacks any dynamics, and is hard to listen to in one sitting. Only Mary's backing vocals (maybe she should sing lead and give up violin?) draws any attention to this otherwise vanilla-flavored folk.It is obvious that these musicians have talent, but they are holding back from true expression; and it shows in their music. Maybe they will let loose and be honest with their listeners on the next album."
5,Beautiful.,"This is a very nicely made onesie, featuring the quality of embroidery I used to do myself before my 3 Honduran babies came along and filled up my free time!"
3,Recording should be better.,"Look for a better recording, recording process of excellent work good be much better. Yet it is worth listening to."
3,So far so good,"I got this to replace the ones that came with my KitchenAid hand mixer, the beaters that came with it broke. So far they work fine."
5,The beaters fit my hand mixer,"The only problem I had with this order, was not knowing if they would fit my mixer. I was happy that they did fit and I didn`t have to buy a new mixer. It would be very helpful to know to what model # they fit. Thank You"
3,Replacement Beaters,This will be our 2nd pair of beaters. Our first mixer never needed its beaters replaced... These beaters work with light mixing.
5,replacement beaters,Received the order in about two days! Very pleased with speediness of receiving the order. Now I can use my mixer again!
3,Kichen Aid Turbo Beaters,"Not the real Kitchen Aid turbo beaters, the beaters work fine but not as strong the original KitchenAid ones . Only question I have is how long will they last?"
3,They work.,Would not buy this mixer again but the beaters do work. I always have the feeling that they are not a sturdy enough fit in the mixer. Very noisy and sound like they will come apart.
1,I hate it,This item is not as strong as the original one. it wobbles when the mixer is on. I am really disappointed.
1,Waste of money,"Ordered beaters to replace item that was lost. Purchased KitchenAid hand mixer about 5 or 6 years ago at Target. These appear to the same as the lost beaters, but they do not lock in place. Unable to use. Will throw away hand mixer and beaters. Will probably replace with new mixer."
2,Useless for mashed potatoes,The primary reason I use a hand mixer is for mashing potatoes. These beaters are useless for mashing potatoes - unless you want more lumps than mash. Very disappointed that a set of more robust beaters are not available for this mixer.
3,Bent Beaters,I needed new beaters desperately as I use my hand held mixer all the time. The beaters came in a timely fashion but they were bent and don't spin smoothly. Probably just a matter of time when one of the spokes breaks again.
1,Do NOT work well in the Kitchenaid Mixer!,"What a BUMMER! My original mixer blades broke..which is awful to begin with since they shouldn't have. I was happy to find replacements that ""said"" they would fit my mixer, but they don't work well in it. They ""fit"", but they clink together when the mixer is on. It was a brand new mixer as well. All in all not happy with Kitchenaid right now.Amazon is great as usual though, sent the item right away, never have issues with Amazon."
1,How did you get a LEFT / RIGHT?,Frustration...Wish I had read Doug's BEFORE I ordered. One kind a fits but Kitchen Aid does NOT manufacture the replacement beaters for the KHM3 manufactured before '97 any longer! The current # is 3181106 IF anyone has a set...or if Doug can tell me where to get a Right/Left set. Thanks
1,Piece of junk,"I bought these beaters as a replacement for the original set which broke. I owned this set for about 6 weeks before they too broke, and that wasn't even with heavy use. They broke where the thin wire attaches to the shaft. I am not happy. Now I have to see if Amazon will replace them. Or maybe I should just switch to Cuisinart."
5,KitchenAid turbo mixer beater,Worked fine as my other beater had broke. Was a little slow getting herebut holiday mail seems to slow things done.
4,Turbo beater,Just exactly what I needed to replace broken beater - it is a shame that Kitchenaid does not make these a bit stronger.
4,Any Hanson fan needs this book!,This book is really cool and it is also the right size to fit in your pocket. It's packed with info and cool pix and it is definately a must buy for any Hanson fan. Some of the info is a bit incorrect though.
4,"very interesting and lots of pics, it was great","I thought this book was great! it is so tiny and cute, It has tons of pictures and lots of info, i recomend getting it!"
2,O-Tay...I Guess,"I thought the book was o-Tay, I mean, I liked that it had a lot of pix, and everything. ITZ good for starters, but when you know a lot about them, the text isn't that exctiting!"
5,Hanson rocks!,KOOYTE book! I LoVe IT! I loVe HaNsOn...VERY good quote at the beginning of the book! HANSON ROCKS! :)
1,This book isn't even worth looking at!,"This book was totally a waste of time, I mean I read it cause I was at a friends house and I was bored, I'd rather stay bored then read about Hanson, which by the way the group is worst then this book and this book is really BAD!!~! Besides, why read about Hanson when you have * N Sync???Ya know I woudn't even have given this book 1 star but there was no option for ""0"" stars!!!!! *N Sync Rules 4-ever!!!!!"
5,Excellent!,"Great adaptations of the Resident Evil games and even better, there are new stories based on all of my favorite characters. Great stories, amazing art. This was cool."
3,Very Itchy But Not That Tasty.......!?,It was good but they skip to many parts. They really don't show the progression of the scenes. If you are a collector or like comics than you should get it. But if you want the full story than get the novels By S.D. Perry.
2,Itchy. Tasty. But not for long....,"Now when I saw this book on Amazon I thought ""what a great idea, I'll bag me a copy of that"". And I was not heavily dissapointed with the book, but I couldn't help feeling that the stories based on Resident Evil and Resident Evil 2, has been rushed (for example, the scene where that ""thing"" bursts out of Ben in Res2 was cut down to 3 frames in the comic). Some of the stories are, to say the least, pathetic (William Birkin going mad at a zoo?). This book is not a necessity to any Resident Evil fans' collection, but my do well for a light read. Not an awful book by any means, but some stories are the fruits of an overworked imagination (and there are only 11)..."
1,Indecisive and Useless,"I will start with what Norman does well: He presents a range of theories an discusses potential problems with them.Whew! Now, on to what Norman fails to do:He fails to present any cohesive final arguement.He interjects many personal opinions as common knowledge, saying ""we think"", when he really means ""I think."" I can understand if he thinks that everyone thinks the same way as him then his book will be logical. It is not.After presenting potential problems, he often makes a statement with no logical basis.Ultimately, Norman fails to present anything worthwhile, and this makes the book ultimately so frustrating. I had to read the book by constantly flipping back to see how he reached his conclusions, but to no avail. He chips away at some of the foundations for just war theories, but fails to present any reasonable arguement in its place."
5,Extrodinary: gives you an overveiw and many details,I have read many books on Cleopatra. Many clutter your mind with information. This book does not give you too many names or details yet still supplies you with enough information to fully understand her life and troubles as well as the lives of those importent in her live. This is a must be read book that is simple and enjoyable yet information packed.
5,mini pennants,I was very happy with product. The pennants are of good thick material. They also are easier to display then the larger pennants you can purchase. I would reccomend these to someone with limited space or someone who can't decide who their favorite team is.
4,Chicken Rotelle Rocks!,"Our teen-aged son took this entree on two week-long adventure trips: one to Boundary Waters Canoe Area and the other a backpacking trip in NC. Compared to the other dehydrated food entrees, this one ranks very high on his list. Delicious flavor, rehydrates well, is filling, and satisfying."
5,Unique,"A wide variety of accounts of shipwrecked, stranded and those seeking adventure in various exotic ocean locales. Highlights include ""The American Robinson Crusoe"" and an account of Herman Melville's experience in the Marquesas, living with native head-hunters. For readers intrigued by this book, see Typee by Melville."
4,great stories of survival,"The stories in this book were mesmerizing and intriguing. Well written. I love true adventure and survival stories, and these are some of the best."
4,"At long last, it's out","Finally out and hope it's a nice set. Very funny odd show that got cancelled too soon. Funny and sharp twisted spoof on children's TV shows that is not intended for children. Favorites include the Christmas episode and the cult episode. If you liked all the TV Funhouse animated shorts on SNL fair bet you will like this one. It never really found a slot on the comedy channel, but I would imagine this would be perfect for adult swim."
5,"Finally, Xabu has caught his tail!","I've spent hours upon hours trying to cobble a home-brewed DVD out of my tapes of these golden episodes. Just as I was about to go back to my annual summer project, I checked online and BOOM! Here they are, for sale! This show stretched the boundaries of television and humor in strange and amazing new directions. As close to a perfect disaster as has ever been broadcast.PS: I have nine watches. None of them are fake."
5,"Little known album, yet one of the greatest of the 80's","I was shopping at a record store in the 80's and saw this album in the dollar bin. It looked kinda cool, and even though I never heard of The Headpins, I bought it. Probably the best dollar I ever spent. This has to be one of the greatest 80's rock albums made. Tight musically, well arranged, and Darby Mills' sexy vocals make this one a must have. I wore out the album in the 80's, wore out a tape, and am trying to wear out my CD right now. Do yourself a favor and listen to the best thing to come out of Canada ... you won't regret it."
4,An intriguing espionage novel,This very well-written thriller is centred on the search for the truth about the assassination of her John F. Kennedy.The storyline is actually fairly plausible. It is mostly fast paced and for the most part believableHowever there were certain scenes and characters that did seem very implausible.The author was an intelligence agent so maybe these types of characters actually do exist. It sometimes seems a strange mixture of authenticity and silliness.The actions scenes are well handled and the dialogue is particularly good. The main character does sometimes seem too good to be true.Overall this was highly enjoyable and I would recommend it.
3,Curiously unexciting for a thriller,"Shortly after JFK is assassinated, U.S. secret agent Paul Christopher suddenly realises he knows who ordered the president's death. We don't know how, we're just told this as a fact. To my mind this is rather a big flaw in what is supposed to be a thriller. From that moment on Christopher quits his job, ignores his bosses and roams around the world tracking down the people he knows can help him. Along the way we learn an awful lot about Vietnamese society and how the concept of the family lies at the heart of the nation's identity. This part reads like an encyclopaedia. Christopher has various adventures, runs around with guns, is shot at, has his car blown up, arranges a kidnap or two, and yet despite all these supposedly exciting scenes the narrative is flat and unexciting. Just as the hero knows from the start who was behind JFK's death, the reader of this book knows that nothing will happen to the agent and that he will end up solving the mystery."
2,The tears of Autumn,I am a fan of Charles McCarry whose past works somehow escaped me until recently. He is one of America's best spy novelists and a good essayist as well. But The Tears of Autumn is not one of his best. The pace is a little slow and the spin on the Kennedy assassination is not convincing--it is a stretch.
3,Boring and Outdated,"Maybe I'm too young, but I couldn't care less about the Kennedys. I know JFK's assassination was a national tragedy; but because it's so far in the past, I just could never get too interested in McCarry's idea that Southeast Asian politics were behind the Dallas shooting.I hate to disagree with so many reviewers, but the writing is passable at best--choppy and so sixties in its characterizations. The unflappable, handsome, will-do-anything-for-the-truth Christopher and his blonde model Molly who pines in her man's absence just seemed so old fashioned and even kitsch.Try Helen MacInnes if you want some sixties-era spy novels. They're better written than this, and they'll hold your interest much better than this outing with McCarry."
2,Did you like the original 1975 version?,"If so, try this website http://www.stef.net/sesamestreetchristmas/ where you can get the original for free. This version is okay, but is missing a few of my favorite tracks, and I was happy to see that I could download the original online. Just for those who would like to know..."
5,Keep Christmas With You All Through The Year,"This CD brings back my childhood memories of staying glued to the TV watching Ernie pestering Bert.The banner song, ""Keep Christmas With You"", will remind you of what Christmas is all about and how you can keep the Christmas spirit alive in you until the next Christmas season."
3,"Ok, Could Use a Little Updating","I bought this for my 2-year-old daughter this year for Christmas. It has a few cute songs, and a few that she asked for by name, but others we skipped like Oscar's ""I Hate Christmas,"" not because we are those freak type of parents, but because of our toddler's tendency to repeat words she hears repeatedly and I didn't want the word ""hate"" on her shortlist, even though she has no idea what it means.Maybe next year they'll come out with a new collection of holiday songs with more traditional songs for little ones just learning the words."
2,"It came, it worked, it destroyed","Update 10-16-12: Have had the charger about a month and it was working great. Did notice that I had to jam it in a little bit to get it to work, but it was charging. Well, today I tried to plug it in and realized that part of the charger had broken off inside my phone. I am currently unsure whether either will ever work again. Not good."
4,Fun; Intuitive.,"The layout is less intuitive than, say, an idiots guide, but doesn't talk down to you and leave out details while doing it.The genius about this book is the fact that it remains intuitive via the writing style. This book was meant, I believe, to be read from front to back as an easily digestible read, but can be taken in part.Good stuff."
5,Great Desktop Reference,"This is the sort of book I keep handy to answer any question that may come up about the US Govt. Easy to find answers, easy to read, yet thorough."
3,"Good for basic knowledge, but bias still shows","Relatively easy to understand explaination of the basics; however the author's political bias is definitely there and comes out repeatedly in his highlighted examples, which overshadows what he should be trying to illustrate."
4,Great overall Government Book,This is a fantastic overview of how the government works. It is easy to read and understand even for a middle-school aged person. It is a great starter book to get a general understanding of the American Government. My 13 year old daughters read this book as part of a preparation for a week long government class.
2,Entertaining but has some controversial advice,"This is a well written and entertaining book, and some of the basic advice is sound. However, the advice on playing a rush, or playing only low cards for a while if low cards seem to be winning, is wrong. Each hand of poker is independent. You can only know about ""rushes"" in hindsight. Limit Hold'em, as Doyle Brunson points out in Super/System, is essentially a mechanical game which should be played with the high cards. I bought Mr. Warren's book and I'm not sorry I did, but read it and every other poker book with a critical mind. Also, be sure to read Jones ""Winning Low Limit Hold'em"", Brunson's ""Super/System"", Sklansky's ""Theory of Poker"", and have a copy of Tablanette's ""Statistics of Hold'em Poker"" handy when you are devising strategies. And get a good beginner's book on probability and statistics if you don't understand why playing your rush or playing low cards is mathematically incorrect. A good example is Freund's ""Introduction to Probability""."
2,Warren's book is repetative and contradictory,"In this book Ken Warren repeats many of his ideas over and over again. Also, Warren focuses too much on position and not the mathamatics of poker. Low and middle limit players can find better books to teach them this complex game."
4,Superb book on Texas Hold-em,Ken Warren's book helped me win $$ the first time I was able to play a serious game of hold-em. The organization of the book makes it easy to flip back to different chapters when I want specific advice on a problem. For the above average beginner or someone with decent poker knowledge I think this book could be of tremendous help.
1,Ken Warren's winner's guide to common sense,"From Ken Warren's Winner's Guide to Texas Hold'em Poker--""Hot Tip: If you do run out of cigarettes while you're playing and you feel that it will affect your play, then I strongly recommend that you go ahead and pay whatever it takes to get a cigarette between your lips again. Three dollars for a pack of cigarettes is a small price to pay compared to what you could losing playing poker while fretting over a cigarette.""Again, this was Ken's ""Hot Tip."" If you want to find out how to improve your play, skip this book. And if you're a smoker, I'm sure you don't need someone telling you when to buy cigs, especially in a book that isn't even related to smoking cessation."
2,don't rely on this book alone,"As a true beginner at Hold 'em, I bought a book (this one) to get me started. Even as a novice, I could spot numerous contradictions throughout the text. Warren gives easy-to-read charts, which is nice. For instance, which hands should be raised, folded, or called based on your position at the table. But at other points, he contradicts himself by reccommending plays that his charts suggest otherwise. It appears to me that this book would be suited more towards mid-limit live games, as opposed to low-limit internet games, where I play. His advice does not hold up under the wildness and insanity that reigns in low-limit online play."
2,pro lady,this book covers certain aspects of poker but not all of it. books by andy and mason are much better especially lou books.
1,probably the worst book ever,"Well I'm not even sure where to begin. The advice in this book must be intended to steer new players in the wrong direction. I do not understand how Warren feels it is ok to check a set of kings or queens, but then says you should not do this with a set of aces. Also Warren feels that a good way to judge a bad poker player is if they have a tatto because, ""Anyone dumb enough to have themself tattooed probably won't exhibit a lot of intelligence at the poker table. They will unknowingly follow your lead at the poker table."" (I swear this is a direct quote) If you want a book that has such idiotic assumptions and misleading strategies as these then this book is for you."
3,Good book for beginners...serious ones look elsewhere.,"Warren does a decent job in introducing a newcomer to hold'em terms, importance of position and basic strategy. Some of the chapters seem elementry ie. chapter on tells but all in all if you have never played hold'em and want to learn some good fundamentals this is a good start..make your first few dollars and move on to higher stakes and higher concepts, try books by Sklansky and Malmuth.....see you at the tables."
1,Don't be fooled,"Warren doesn't know what he's talking about. There are several serious errors in his book, mainly that he seems to believe that the cards have ""memory"" (they don't), that you should play rushes, etc. Ignore this! Any student of probability can tell you that this is bad advice. In addition, he has no understanding of pot odds, and has no concept of the value of four-flushes. Although his basic advice is generally sound, it's geared more towards a 10-20 game than the 2-4 or 3-6 game that most readers of the book will play in. In your average ""no-fold'em hold'em"" game, you can play more loosely than Warren allows, especially suited connectors. You'd be better off spending your money on Lee Jones's book, for he has a much more solid understanding of low-limit hold'em."
4,It changed me from a loser to a winner.,Tthis was the first Hold'em book that I bought. It is written expressly for the 1-4-8-8 game and contains everthing that is written in other poker books. He has some excellent charts for the probabilities of various hands. Worth the money.
1,Read this book if you want to lose your money,"If you watched rounders and now think you can go out and beat the world at poker then by all means buy this book, and lose your money to me. I have not read the complete book, but the areas I have read are weak. The suugestions on the kind of players to play against are horrible. Dealers uasualy know the game, they watch it all the time see the winning players and learn fronm them. Just because someone is young under 25 does not make them a good opponet, I'm only 22 and win often in the games I play in. Save your money and buy Lee Jones book Winning At low-limit Holdem. Otherwise waste your money on this book."
1,Flawed copy,"This is my first book on poker I have ever read. However, my copy is physically flawed. My copy goes up to page 176 and then repeats itself back to pp. 129-176! So, one-fifth of my book is duplicated. (This is the sixth printing dated May 2003) I bought this from the ""used"" section and by all appearances, it looked ""like new"". Oh well. Mistakes happen."
2,"This book is OK for a beginner, but won't get you far.","Warren's book contains some good info for the beginning hold-em player, but you will have to wade through often contradictory advice to find the few good nuggets of wisdom. I would recommend looking elsewhere if you are interested in solid mathematical foundations and game theory based advice."
5,Perfect for beginners,This is the first poker book I have read and I have re-read many of the subjects covered. This book is perfect for a beginner who wants to get better and gain a better understanding of how to profit. This is not a tournament book- it is a low-limit hold 'em book. I instantly realized mistakes that I was making previously- ESPECIALLY in hand strengths and how to deal with specific but common situations. It helps to explain why some hands are unplayable when most people will stick with them. It teaches how to play others rather than just your cards. Beginners will benefit from this book.
4,much food for thought,"My interest soared for poker when i watched Rounders and just had to discover this wonderous game called hold-em I found the book very down to earth ,as such that anyone could grasp its message.The book is nicely put in order from beginning to end.The little extras about tells etc. really was a bonus.Believe it or not my only experience in playing is the ,World Series Of Poker ,cd rom.I take great pride that now I rarely leave the pc after a session not a winner.I have tried extensively to get with a group of hold-em players but theres none in this city. To be a winner you must study under a winner .All the best to Ken Warren..."
4,"Simple, well written","This book helped turn me from a babe in the woods to a consistant winner pretty quickly. Jones focuses on the very basic concepts that are important to a beginning player. I maintain that basic concepts, well-presented are more important to the beginner. Slansky's tome-like, math based instruction is useful in taking your game to the next level, but this book is great as the base of the pyramid.I would agree with other more critical reviewers that the stereotyping of players by appearance is silly."
5,wonderfil product.,Grandchild loves the music and characters. She is 8 month old she loves this DVD. Very cute.
5,Must have.,"This is a great item for little ones. My grand children love wonder pets but it isn't on very often, this is a great way for them to get to watch it whenever they like and they learn nursery rhymes."
3,Greatgrand daughter loves it..but...,All the singing in high pitched baby voices gets on my nerves..will not be buying another on of this series...
3,Its Wonder Pets,"My kids love the Wonder Pets but they watched this once and was done. So strange as they watch the WP whenever I let them. I guess they like the WP's adventure packed shows more than these. I tried to get them to watch it more, but they just complain and say they rather watch the other episodes on TV we have recorded."
5,Buy this vacuum!,"Okay, this is the first review I've ever written - and the first time I've ever felt like I needed to.If you have dogs, cats, birds, kids, a messy husband or wife, dirt tracked in on the floor or dust bunnies under the bed, you've gotta buy this vacuum! I use it more than my upright, because it's portable, and it's powerful. It's super easy to clean, and you can use it on small carpet or rug areas with the brush or use the hose to suck up the dirt. It reaches into all those areas you wish you could, though I do wish it came with a longer extension. No matter.. it's corded, so you don't have to worry about the battery wearing down when you're half finished.. I thought this might be a pain, but it isn't. The cord is very long and wraps around the unit for storage. The bottom line here is... if you want a powerful, portable, easy-to-clean hand vacuum, this is the one to get. And if you have pets and/or kids.. it's a necessity."
1,this vacuum is a waste of time AND money,"Other reviews have disclosed that the power nozzle motor no longer exists on this model and that the hose doesn't lock into the body of the machine as it's supposed to. This model is no longer shown on the manufacturer's web site, having been replaced by their Power Reach model no. MO8245. I've started the complaint process, but given the lack of results achieved by others, I'm not optimistic. In any case, this model doesn't perform, and what a shame that no one will stand behind it! Beware this manufacturer!"
3,no longer with two motors,"Dirt Devil no longer makes a two motor model. This is a great prodect minus the only having one motor problem. How can you tell which model you received? On the bottom of the actual dirt devil there is a number called the MFG code,103A - 2 motors103B - 1 motor, this what is now produces by dirt devilIf buying it for the hose and portability its great.If buying it for carpet, upholstry or other fabric don't bother. The suction with pick up dirt but with out the added power of the revolving brush will not pick up locked in dirt."
3,Model Mixup,"Just spoke with Dirt Devil and the red model that sounds like it's crap is Model #08245, not the Platnium Force Model #08240 which Amazon is currently selling (and I am buying). The woman stated the that Platinum Force does have 2 motors and she also agreed that that Power Reach (red one) will actually stop if you push too hard on it. So some of these reviews sound like they are referring to the Power Reach, not the Platinum Force.If Amazon is showing this model and shipping out the Power Reach I would think that they would pay to ship the wrong item back. (THEY BETTER)! I will write a review once I receive mine and use it."
2,Dissatisfied,"I have to agree with some of the more recent reviewers on the Dirt Devil 8240. I specifically bought it based on the majority of positive reviews here, but unfortunately, the brush does not turn anymore, and the vacuum is now purely suction -- and quite loud at that. I have had the vacuum less than a year, and do not use it all that often, and clean it regularly, so I do not believe the faulty brush is something I have done. The suction is ""okay,"" but not good enough. The vacuum is not meeting my expectations and needs. I am now ordering the Fantom 430 which apparently has a motorized brush, and seeing how that works out."
2,Does not work well on hard floors,The vents are the sides near the front so dirt is blown around before the vac gets a chance to suck it up. It does work well in carpeted areas.
3,The hose attachment worked well. . .,"Shortly after I purchased this vacuum in 2004, the front part of it stopped picking up anything. The hose worked continued to work well, though."
2,Below expectations!,"My first complaint is that it's too bulky and heavy to be considered a hand vac. I consider myself physically stronger than the average house mom, and it's cumbersome to maneuver around. My second main complaint is that the suctioning power was just not there. And the roller would jam like every 30 seconds."
1,Does NOT have 2 motors!,"Do not listen to the editorial review. It is not accurate. This item does NOT have a second motor driving the brush roll. The brush roll is useless, as it is driven by air moving by a turbine, connected to a belt, that is supposed to turn the roll. This is not NEAR enough force to move the roll against ANY resistance. The suction alone is not strong enough to clean effectively. The unit is large, heavy, unweildy, and the detachable nozzle head does not have a hose long enough to make it worthwhile. This is the poorest, loudest hand vac I have ever owned. I do not recommend it to anyone."
1,"Yes, this product doesn't have two motors anymore",We returned the product becuase it didn't have two motors (as described by many recent reviewers).
2,Does not work well on carpeted stairs.,"I was looking for a hand vac to vaccuum my carpeted steps with. Since it isn't belt driven, the rotating brushes stop turning when you apply pressure to the vaccuum when your trying to clean the stairs. Don't like it much. It works ok for hard surfaces, but I really wanted it for carpeted stairs."
2,Power Nozzle stopped working,"I used this vacuum about 6 times on furniture to pick up the cat hair. It worked well until, just like another reviewer said, the power nozzle stopped rotating. Now it's practically worthless."
2,Manufacturer change,"I ordered this hand vac, Dirt Devil 08240, only to receive the version that has ONE motor, not the 2 as advertised.After looking at the description on the DirtDevil.com website, which also advertised 2 motors, I contacted them to find out what was up.The manufacturer is no longer producing Model 08240 with 2 motors and apologized for not updating their website.With a dog on the way that sheds massively twice a year and 2 cats and shag carpeting on the stairs, I NEED the power of a motorized brush. I did some online research for other brands that would meet my needs but didn't really find anything that I believe is comparable to the original Model 08240.So, I called around where I live and found a vacuum dealer who still has some of the original, 2-motor Model 08240 hand vacs in stock and will purchase it there. I suggest others do the same if it's as important to them to have 2 motors as it is to me. And do it soon, before existing supplies run out."
1,Was told one thing; got stuck with another,"I read about this great two motor system and had to have it.So I went to Sears who was out of it; but assured me there was a new model with the same features coming out.I then went back and discovered the changes. (Red power reach piece of crap)So I called Dirt Devil and was repeatedly reassured by a less then ""all here"" person that they were exactly the same.THEY ARE NOT THE SAME MACHINE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!So going on faith I decided to buy the machine thinking it was me not them.I then noticed the vacuun fan that uses the suction of the machine to turn the power nozzle.Assuming that I made a mistake I kept it.(I have to learn to return things I don't like.)Now I read the reviews and realize that I was screwed too.Dirt Devil is a deceitful company.Of course as soon as you touch carpeting with any force the nozzle quits turning."
4,Lord of the Flies,"As a good and devout Christian I normally try to avoid temptation. Things with the word ""Devil"" in the name are usually evil creations of the beast. But I was tempted by the shiny surfaces and the suction power of this machine. I succumbed and now everything is clean around me but my soul is tainted."
4,Laugh out loud....,"Take a closeted gay man, his republican beauty queen daughter, and have him finance her bid for state office in New York, and you have a brilliant novel! Patricia Nell Warren hooked me with The Front Runner series of books. And when I read this book, there were many times I found myself smiling and laughing. Set in the 70s, the book does read like a comical version of Anita Bryant's (I hope I have that name right) campaign to extinguish gay rights bills. But this book, takes that true life event, and plugs the readers in deeper to the state of minds of its principal characters. It is touching, humorous, and passionate. It delves into the life of a gay man, his deep love for his daughter, and how two lives that should be so close are often so distant."
4,"good but not as thought provoking as ""The Frontrunner""","This book was very moving and of course was quite similar to the battle that Antia Bryant was waging. I thought the book was quite reader friendly and moved at a very good pace; however it is no where as good as MS.Warrens, landmark novel""The Frontrunner"" that deals with the same topic, homosexuality. The characters in ""The Frontrunner"" are more clearly defined-however the core issue of tolerance and understanding come out loud and clear in ""The Beauty Queen"" a good read and a good boo"
5,Excellent way to start your green belts!,This book is a great intro book for new green belts. I am using this in our corporate office for training.Faith McGaryInfoNXX
4,Practical Primer for those who are doing the project work,"This practical, description of how to successfully complete the basics and obtain significant results has been used by teams guided by BearingPoint for the past 5 years. We have purchased the book every year for 5 years (Peter Pande, we're real fans)and I continue to find useful tips for teams of new Six Sigma practitioners.Well written, logical with examples and helpful hints."
2,Doesn't Measure Up,"Having read their first book, The Six Sigma Way, I was looking forward to reading this follow up companion book, The Six Sigma Way Team Fieldbook.While the book contains some valuable information and tips, the book is plagued with inaccuracies and errors. I expected more from authors who are writing about Six Sigma.Their credibility in writing about Six Sigma is called into question by the publication of a book with so many obvious errors. They can 'talk the talk' but they did not 'walk the walk' when it comes to their own book."
1,Do not buy the kindle edition,"Don't waste your money, just buy the paperback edition. If you pretend to acquire this book on kindle prepare to burn 116.76 USD, when the paperback will just set you down 23.07 USD right here on amazon.I really really don't get the price difference, and I wont buy any Kindle book ever again. I just bought one chapter of the kindle book and I can't believe I did it, it's my fault I admit it, but wow does this selling books by chapters sucks.J.M."
4,Great source of information for the practictioner,"This book is the one book for someone who is joining their first six sigma team. It will give you a feel for the tools and methodology that you will be exposed to and provides handy references of forms, metrics and best practices if you are requested to complete a task in a six sigma project. The material is very well organized and summarized for usage as an ongoing team resource."
2,Poor Mounting system,"Was VERY disappointed in this product. Adhesive is not strong enough to hold Sirius radio, have tried several time to mount at various locations in vehicle, but always falls off. Also would be nice to have a greater range in the swivel mounts. Perhaps goosneck mount would have been better choice. Advise is to pass on this one, unless you are not using the adhesive mount."
5,Burton Cummings' Crystal Vocals,"Dream of a Child is a fastastic album featuring the crystal clear vocals of former Guess Who lead singer, Burton Cummings. His voice is, as always stellar and unique. His outstanding powress on the keyboards is legendary. If you enjoyed the old Guess Who hit ""These Eyes"", you'll love this CD."
5,That voice!!,"Anything Burton Cummings!!Solo or with the Guess Who, he can't be beat.Saw him in concert this past summer (08) with Randy Bachman and that concert was every bit as good (if not better) then seeing them together with the Guess Who. Now that was talent at its very best."
3,Espaillat's weakest book,"This is Rhina Espaillat's longest and weakest collection of poetry. Following three great books of poetry, she has produced a work that is simply not up to the standard I have become used to seeing from her. The poems are not as original nor is the language quite as seemless or beautiful. Not that there aren't some good poems (""To Diana"" and ""Shop Talk"" are among the best she has written), but this just isn't what I've come to expect from an Espaillat collection."
4,"Fun brain exercise, but not very challenging","We just got it this week, it is very fun to play, good brain exercise. Easy to carry, only need one player.But it doesn't seem to be challenging at all. My 8 year old and I went through 40+ of them easily."
3,"Didn't like it as well as ""Square by Square""","When I purchased this product, I thought the bricks were singles, not connected in groups of varying patterns. It's pretty tough for most children under 15-16 years or age or more to figure out. There are 60 designs to build which is good but would not recommend for younger kids."
3,so - so,This is a good book but I can find the same research online on you tube - and easier to understand.
3,"Long on history, short on information","Not a practical handbook for growers. More of a textbook than a how to. There is some useful information if you're willing to sift through the dissertations on botany. It would have been far better to condense all the important stuff about growing, (nothing specific on fertilzers for instance) and simplify the layout to a step by step guide with footnotes on all the technical stuff."
5,marijuana botany,"if you enjoy breeding cannabis this book WILL teach you how,not really an easy read but very informative,I really liked it!"
3,A very nice deck,"I have used this deck for about a year now, and like it quite a bit. For one thing, while the card meanings are approximate Rider-Waite, many of the images are quite different, but still very evocative. For example, the RW 9 cups shows a fat man sitting in front of 9 cups. This deck shows a maiden sitting by a lovely rocky pool, with a spring trickling into it, and 9 cups submerged in the water. Lovely image, and very in tune with the 'wishing well' aspect of this card.The book has very good relationship meanings for all the cards, making it very easy to read. And since relationships are the focus of the majority of my readings, this feature is really useful. The celtic legends in the book are very cool. I have lots of Tarot books and this is one of the ones I use the most. I don't think the art is bad--it's soft and misty, like watercolors. All in all, a very nice deck."
2,MANGAL PANDEY IS A DISSOPOINTMENT,MANGAL PANDEY IS A DISSOPOINTMENT. THE FILM DOESN'T GO ANY WHERE NEAR TO THE EXPECTATIONS. THE FILM HAS NOTHING INTRUSTING AND NOTHING ENTERTAINING. DULL DIRECTTION AND SCREENPLAY. TOO LONG AND BORING.AAMIR KHAN IS SUPERB. HE IS IN FORM YET AGAIN.TOBEY STEVENS IS GOOD.RANI DOES AN HONEST JOB.AMISHA PATEL IS HARDLY THERE.DON'T BUY IT.
4,A favorite toy in our house,"We have two big dogs (lab mix and coonhound) who love nothing more than to destroy their toys, sometimes within minutes. As a result, we're hard pressed to find inexpensive toys that we know will eventually be torn to shreds. This toy is the best we've found so far, they still destroy it but the price is more palatable than spending $12-$15 on something that won't last. They chew it and play tug with it and we can re-braid and re-tie the knots to give it a longer life, sometimes up to 3-4 weeks. This isn't a bad option if your dog is really hard on toys."
4,my dog loves it but starting to come apart,"i hold the handle part and my samoyed pulls at the tassle ends. she really enjoys the game and gets excited when the tug rope comes out. but with some daily use for about a month, some of the pieces have started to come out. i still give it 4 stars, though, because it's woven in such a way that even if some pieces fall out, the main structure is still intact (so far) so we can continue to play for at least a little while longer. plus, as far as dog toys go, $5 is a pretty good deal for daily entertainment :)."
3,Not a durable tug toy for large dogs,"After reading such glowing reviews as ""best toy ever"" I decided to give this a shot. My large dog needs sturdy toys, and this one does NOT fill the bill. About five minutes after removing this from the package to play tug with it, pieces started falling off. Not a good start. The toy is large but not durable, and not worth the money."
3,not sure,My dogs don't really understand this toy... it doesn't have the rope threads to rip off or a squeaker. I think they both just checked it for squeakers then never touched it again. My dogs don't like to play tug of war and aren't really mouthy though. If your dog is this would be better than a rope that has threads.
3,ok toy,"This toy isn't what I thought it was. I had a tug of war rope for my dogs. I have 2 young Rat Terriers, and a Aussi. They tend to play very hard with their toys and they destroy them sometimes in a matter of seconds. The rope I had they chewed it and played tug of war with for months and it finally fell apart. I bought this rope thinking it was the same. It wasn't although it is long enough for all 3 dogs to latch onto, I can even grab it to play. In the 1st week pieces were coming off. It's like a scarf material so it is sturdy, It just comes apart in small pieces. The toy is no longer braided. It's a huge mess. I don't anticipate it lasting to much longer. They haven't stopped playing with it, and they are just steady pulling it apart when they aren't tugging on it."
1,Ripped apart in five minutes,Don't waste your money. My dog is a strong chewer but is small and usually does well with rope toys. This is very soft fabric. It is not a rope toy. Shreds remain
2,Pretty flimsy,Not expecting this to last too long. We have to put it up after the pup plays with it as it would not stand up to a good 'chew'.
2,the 5 Minute Chew Toy!,"Well, maybe 3 minutes. I read the reviews and was sure this toy would at least a couple of weeks. I was a couple of weeks off. I gave it to my 50 lb. lab mix. She took it and ran into the next room. I was distracted for a couple of minutes, then followed her into the room to see if she liked her new toy. In that short amount of time she had completely ripped it to shreds. I'm giving it two stars because I got a good laugh out of it."
5,its that good good,You can't go wrong with Vic Firth. Get these sticks or get full blown A.I.D.S. instantly. That is my final offer.
3,Haven't really used them yet,"I ordered another pair of sticks at the same time, so I've been using those. So I know this is kinda a pointless review. But still they ARE Vic Firth, so I have a feeling they do pretty well."
5,Nice sticks,My son wanted a variety of sticks and he really likes these. He has been drumming experience is 6 years.
4,El Maestro Rafael Hernandez- El Mejor Compositor Boricua,"El album de Felipe Pirela interpreta a Rafael Hernandez Marin es una joya musical debido a tres detalles basicos:1. Rafael Hernandez es el maximo exponente del quehacer musical boricua, todas sus canciones son joyas de coleccion.2. Felipe Pirela fue un gran cantante, voz y sentimiento bendecidos, que hicieron llorar a muchos puertorriquenos con sus magnificas interpretaciones.3. En el recuerdo de los amantes del bolero de los anos 50 al 70 las interpretaciones de Felipe Pirela y las composiciones de Rafael Hernandez viviran para siempreYo quisiera sugerir otras compilaciones de Rafael Hernandez con interpretes como Marco Antonio Muniz, Chucho Avellanet, El Trio Los Panchos, Eddie Gorme y Gilberto Monroig. Tambien sugiero a otros compositores como Pedro Flores, Edmundo Disdier y Don Felo."
2,Moldy Smell,"I bought this washer and dryer set about a year ago. At first it was amazing - not only cute but cleaned well. After about a week though I noticed that my clothes didn't smell great after washing them. In fact, they didn't smell like they were even washed. I went online and found out that there are tons of people having similar issues with this brand. There are even class actions being taken. Not litigious in nature I have found that there are things to do such as using a hot water bleach cycle once a week to clean the drum, however, I find this rather wasteful and disappointing to have to use such measures on a brand new machine. I'm sorry I bought it. Otherwise it works fine...its just that the point of a washer is to actually get the clothes to look and smell clean.... not like mildew."
1,Complete Piece of Crap,My husband bought this washing machine (and matching dryer) as a surprise for me to replace my 15 year old top-loading machine. He bought it at H&H Gregg. The machine began to have problems after one month. It started with the drum not spinning. After fighting with H&H they covered the $300 + repair fee. Since then we have replace the door latch - twice. No warranty coverage. Just replaced the draining pump. $320. No warranty coverage. And was told the hinge on the door will need to be replaced soon. The door must be left open between washings to prevent nasty things from happening. I'm about to throw in the towel and buy an inexpensive top loader - 15 years and NOT ONE SERVICE CALL.
2,Planned obsolecence,"We bought this same washer sold by GE. I was shocked today when the repair man said it was made by Frigidaire. Not only does a Company like GE. take it's jobs overseas, but it farms out it's appliances to other companies. Long story short, top load is the best, preferably an older top load without the 1/2 tub rinse cycle. All of these water restrictions have made these companies produce inferior products. This machine lasted 5 years to the day. Now I am told the pump and the bearings are shot. More than $600. to repair. According to Amazon, I can get this same piece of crap new for $29 more dollars. And talk about conservation, I will throw this machine away and buy another hunk of metal and plastic again in five years. That leaves us with a very full landfill, and Fridgedaire with full pockets! Take home lesson as told to us by the repair man, if you must buy this crappy machine BUY THE EXTENDED WARRANTY!"
4,A simple pump that does its job.,"We purchased this simple foot pump to use for our inflatable kiddie pool and floating devices for our daughter. It's no heavy duty pump, but it gets the job done and is easy to use! We were able to inflate the kiddie pool in a matter of minutes! If you want a no-frills pump, this works well and the price can't be beat!"
2,Platinum Force not so great.,"After my very old hand-me-down Electrolux quit, I began shopping for a new vacuum. With a new long haired puppy in the house, I wanted one with strong suction power. I did some research online and decided upon the Dirt Devil Platinum Force. I could hardly wait to get it home. It only took a second to assemble and I tested it out. It was so hard to push and pull--much harder than I was used to, but it seemed to really have strong suction. The box claimed it had more suction power than any other upright, and it seemed to. I was thrilled with all the dog hair and dirt it picked up and decided to empty the canister. I noticed dog hair and dust all over the outside of the dirt canister! I knew that was a serious problem, and one that I could not ignore. I had decided to live with how hard it was to operate, but I could not live with particles escaping from the vacuum. I disassembled it and boxed it up. I got a full refund and now I am searching for a good vacuum once again."
1,It conked out after the third use,"I bought it for my dormroom floor. A lot of research was put into the decision because we were buying the vacuum for over 40 people to use. It had a great warranty and great reviews and we wouldn't have to pay to replace any bags, so we decided to get it. However, after the third use it wouldn't turn on again. The manual said that we had to get it serviced, which was too inconvenient for us so we took it back to target in person. All in all we lost [was] shipping. I'm sure the dirt devil warranty would have covered the repair, but the fact that it only worked three times made us decide to find a different vacuum or to not get one in the first place."
2,"Not ""for the dogs""","Pros: absolutely the best suction you can find...it will suck up EVERYTHING.Cons: well see below...If you have animals, do NOT buy this vac. I have had it over a year now and although it has great suction it is so hard to empty the canister that I think it isn't worth having. Also the design is poor. The filter should not be in with all the dirt and hair! Trying to clean that is a nightmare and as another reiewer said you can not get the hair and dirt off.It ends up being a smelly mess and now if I vacuum with it my house smells !! You are not supposed to clean the filters and replacements are like 30.00 and take 2 weeks to arrive. It is very hard to push and the caster wheels are more of a pain than a help. However, I must admit even though I have now replaced this vacuum it does have the BEST suction of any vacuum I have ever owned including my new Bissell lift off bagless."
4,Lots of suction,"Plenty of suction, a switch on top to turns off roller for hard floors, a foot adjustment for height, a bit hard to push, rear swivel wheels help some. It really likes to suck up area rugs, works well on wall to wall. Only a crevice tool as an attachment, power cord is a good length. It has a lifetime belt, we'll see how that works. The plastic dirt container has a filter in the middle and can be a bit messy to empty. This unit has a 14 inch cleaning width, this replaced a Hoover Windtunnel V2 which something broke on the first day, the Dirt Devil has more suction than the Hoover."
1,not so good,I bought a Platinum Force in Jan. '02 9 months later the hose that goes into the cartridge broke. We fixed it but again it broke. It is very hard to push even if you have it on the highest level. Because of the swivel wheels on the back you can not vacuum your area rugs. When i try to pick it up the bottom won't latch so you have to puch it around the house and again that is not an easy thing to do.
2,Permanent belt broken after 3 months.,"It works great if it's not staying in the repair shop. I brought this because there is a permanent belt and no replacement, unfortunately I broke down after a few months with very little uses. This part is taken along time to repair and the part takes 3 long weeks to arrive. I hope this help."
4,Amazing technology,"I just bought my Dirt Devil yesterday. When I got it home and took it for a run I couldn't believe how much it picked up. I've had a Eureka Victory for the past 7 or 8 years and it was starting to die. Having a cat and dog I needed something with more suction power. Vacuuming 2 rooms it filled the whole canister. The downfall to it is the bagless feature and I think that would apply to all bagless vacuums. Trying to clean off the filter and canister caused really bad allergies. Suggestion- put the filter in a trash bag, seal it and tap it against something. Then after the dust settles, dump the rest into the bag. Otherwise you're in for a major dust storm."
2,Broken Permanent Belt,I have had my Platinum Force Upright for less than one year. The permanent drive belt is a thin rubber belt with small teeth. The teeth on the belt have stripped and the front roller does not spin properly and is very noisy. The dirt devil phone representative states they have no plans to sell this belt to the public. This will become an issue after the warrenty expires. I don't think the belt should be advertised as being permanent.
1,Sorry I took this one home!,"My last vacuum died suddenly and without warning and so I was forced to get a new vacuum as I was having dinner guests over. I had intended to buy a Eureka, but they were out of stock. Since reviews were fairly good on this one I decided to give it a shot. I found the vacuum very hard to push (much more difficult than I had ever expected - a full upper-body workout), even when I changed the carpet height settings and was not impressed AT ALL with it's cleaning ability. I still saw pieces of dirt and other debris on the floor even after sweeping the area a second time. Needless to say it is going back today, after one day of ownership. I was sorry that I took this one home!!"
1,Disappointing vacuum,"I purchased this vacuum today only because I had a weak moment and I could not find the one I really wanted in the stores. When it was out of box and together I vacuumed my rooms and hallway. I don't have inside pets like most of the reviewers do but I have two kids and a berber carpet.First, it was stubborn when I pushed it on level 2 and I am truly not a wimp. I felt it was as noisy as my old vacuum was and I did not like set up of this bagless feature(messy). It didn't seem to suck real good BUT it did pick up alot of stuff.I am returning it tomorrow and have purchase online the elusive and highly rated Eureka Boss Smart Vac 4870DT with the true hepa filter bag. I have researched that one alot and know it is the right one for me."
4,Gentle Reading,"While certainly not great fiction, it is a delightful read. The Inspector's household characters create a warm and caring group that is quite comfortable."
5,Loveable Mrs. Jeffries and Friends,"As a previous reviewer mentioned, this series is ""cozy"" even if not always historically accurate. The Jeffries household is much like an adult version of the Baker Street Irregulars, but less intense so to speak. If you have had a bit of stress in you life, these are like watching an old '50's TV program that didn't add to your pre-existing stress."
5,good accuracy,"I have always liked the Stabila levels and this one is no exception. It seems to be quite accurate and I got it to complete a set of 24"",torpedo, 16""compass and a 48"" one."
5,This is a hit with our family,I just left this out on the coffee table on Christmas day and soon found our family members of all ages having a ball with this game. It's still on the coffee table and everybody who visits picks it up and plays.
2,Mine broke 10 minutes after turning it on,"Some friends and i were playing this and about 10 minutes into the game it keep making a loud beeping that is suppose to mean the balls are missing, when they weren't. we tried moving the balls around to different spaces but it kept on making that lou beeping. we tried resetting it several times but it still wouldn't work. It was extremely fun while it did work, but i would have to say you should definetly save the receipt for this game in case you have the same problem. in the games instructions it says that if the game malfunction to try resetting it, which tells me it happens a lot."
4,Lots of Holiday Fun!!!,This game is a lot of fun. We played this game over the holidays and had a blast. Even the younger members of my family were able to pitch in. It is a hard feat to find a game that young and old will have as much fun playing as they did this game. The only drawback that I can find is that at times it is a little hard to hear. Other than that this game is a great buy!!!!
5,Fun and Addictive,Everyone in our house (8 years to adult) loves this game. Once you get started it is hard to stop. Can be played alone or with others. Keeps them busy and mom too.
4,"""Say What"" electrinic game","This electrinic game is a lot of fun whether it's one person or a group of people playing. The game presents a phrase in mixed-up order and the player has a limited amout of time to get the balls, representing the different words into the correct order. I wasn't familiar with all the phrases presented, but it still makes for a fun time. Even when just one person is playing, others can be encouraged to help out figure the order, and it's even fun for those just watching!"
4,Mother of high school and college kids,"I was running out of ideas for Christmas gifts for my college daughter. This popped up on Amazon - so I thought we'd give it a try. The entire family enjoyed playing. Even when it sat on the table, you'd find yourself playing a quick game by your self. (I found my husband doing that too) It's kind of addicting. Only drawback I can see - is that you need to have a fairly quite room in order to hear the words."
4,Great fun for the whole family,I was surprised how fun this game was and great for kids 9 and older!
4,Great product!,My family and I enjoy this game very much. It is a wonderful educational tool for helping students put sentences in order. There should have been a volume button however because many times you can't understand the word or words.
3,Just alright,"This is a fun game, my kids love to use it, however it's not the best.The sensors don't always work so you constantly hear ""ball is missing"" over and over, until you push down on it. And now that we have had it for awhile, the words get mixed up. It give the same word several times, so it really is a guessing act as to where they have to go. It worked great for about the first week."
5,a lot of fun for the whole family,This game is so fun. You can play up to 5 people and set the difficulty level for each player (Great feature!). The challenge is to unscramble a phrase is the alloted time. We have had a great time with this game. It doesn't take long to get through a round so you don't have to commit a lot of time to playing.
5,FUN FUN FUN,"My 10 year old daughter got this for Christmas this year. Her and I have played this ALOT!!! And we do ALOT of laughing!!! Of course we do come across some sayings that we (even I) are not familiar with, but we still have fun trying to put the words/sayings in order. This is fun for kids (not too young) or adults. Just try to put the pieces (saying) in order before the time runs out. That's all there is to it."
5,Good Simple Fun,Say WhatWhat a surprise this game was. Everyone loves it. We got one for each of our adult kids for Xmas because they wear mine out when they come over. Lots of fun for small group too. It gives you sayings in mixed up bits and you have to put them in order in a timed manner. Each one shorter then the last. Seems simple but everyone loves it.
4,Well Pleased,My early teen kids have wanted this game since December. They never had it in stores after Christmas so we finally ordered it online. They love the game it is actually fun for the whole family.
5,Say What! is GREAT!,We played it as a family and it was really fun- It works no matter how many people you have- from one to a group.
5,SAY WHAT is so much fun!,"SAY WHAT is so much fun! There are 5 balls and each ball contains 1-3 words. There are famous phrases that are mixed up, for example unscramble the following: Dead, Dong, the witch, and Ding. Did you come up with ""Ding Dong The Witch is Dead""? You have a choice of games, to unscramble the words in an allotted amount of time or to solve it in three tries. Up to 5 people can play, if you have more you can do teams. We haven't put this down since we got it. The only thing that stinks is ... we've played it so much the phrases are now repeating themselves."
4,I bought this as a gift...,"and now I need one for myself! Sometimes, it's a bit difficult to understand the words, but that could be because we were in a crowded noisy room. Ir's quite fun. The other video review that someone submitted is what sold me!"
5,Say What?!,"What an addicting little toy! Once you get started its hard to put it away. Its fun to watch my son try to figure out some of ""older"" phrases or songs. Even more fun to see his expression when I know the phrase or song."
3,Lot's of Fun but gets boring,"My daughter loves the game and we play it occasionally, one good thing about it you can quit anytime you want to , you dont have to keep playing until it over, and it is fun trying to guess the phrase, but she did get bored with it and set it aside it's a kind of a put in the closet game and pull it out occasionally kind of game but over all fun."
3,"Fun, until you loose a piece",The adults really had a hard time walking away from this game until one of the pieces came up missing.....now the entire game is in the garbage.
4,We LOVE this game.,Our family loves this game. Our ages range from 17 to 47 and someone is always playing Say What.The Davis Family
5,Unexpected addictive fun,"I had read some of the previous reviews and thought I'd order it for the family for the holiday gatherings. What a fun game, very addictive! Everyone wanted in on the action. "" I want to try! I want to try!"" The game gives you a jumble of words by lighted balls to put in order in a given time mode or in a number of try mode. It was much more fun than I expected."
3,Radica Say What!,"This is a fun product however, it is quite difficult at times to understand the words that are being said. The tone is not very clear. The volume is also a slight problem. If it is not completely quiet in the room, you really have a hard time catching everything that is said. But that said, we like this product."
3,Poor quality speaker,"The prior reviews are accurate. This game can be fun, BUT I was disappointed by the poor quality of the speaker. Some of the words come out garbled and unclear. For younger players who may not be too familiar with some of the phrases, they don't stand a chance if they can't even understand the words being spoken."
3,A fun puzzle game,"The game was (look at was) fun! I know this is a simple way to start a review, but the basis of a game should be simple, easy to play, and leave you with a sense of enjoyment when done. I didn't think it was overall complicated, however I only worry about the fact I played it a the first couple of weeks then it has sat in my game closet for over a year now. I think this game is fun, but loses it replayability quickly. It's a little advanced for younger children and adults might get board after playing it a couple of times.There are much better game for kids like Hyper Dash that would make a better gift."
3,Niece gift,"This is a unique application of electronics and knowledge. Recommend this to challenge grade school kids through adults. Seller was responsive, price was average."
2,Not a fan,"these ""paints"" are like soap but just with more pigment - not like paint. I suppose I should've expected that from bath paints. But still, they have a very strong perfume scent and soapy - not ideal for any kid who may have dry or sensitive skin. I don't recommend."
1,Terrible product,"I bought this for my two year old who loves bath crayons and bath art in general. He was so excited for it. He tried it once and told me to throw it away. Literally. The paint was thick and gooey, but did not stick to the bathtub or shower walls. When it did actually stick to the tub, it was almost completely clear. Not a fun toy. A total waste of money. If I could give it no stars, I would."
1,Weak.,"This product is weakly colored bubble bath, not fingerpaint at all. My two year olds were very disappointed that when they tried to draw on the walls, they couldn't see what they were drawing. They were confused and needed to dump out an entire bottle in their hand to spread on the wall in order to see anything. Then because it was all used up, they cried because there wasn't any more. The palette is worthless because you can't hold enough ""paint"" in any of the fingers to be able to see anything when painted. The consistency is like bubble bath or shampoo, so in other words, runny and not a good material to use for painting. The kids couldn't even make hand prints! On the plus side, it did not stain my walls or grout. Not that I would expect it to... because there isn't enough pigment!"
3,"Great idea, but you can't really see the paint","Well, my daughter LOVED the thought of painting in the tub. This product looked like just the ticket. Cute colors, sponge to clean up, what more could you ask? Well, the only problem is that you can't really see the colors! I'm sure if she used half of the small bottles of paint, it might show up as a darker color, however with the small amount of paint used to fill the holder, you can barely make a mark. Cute idea, but disappointing in reality."
2,Have better paint,"I have to admit, when my friend got me Mary Kay bath paints I was skeptical. But the colors (Red/Blue/Yellow) are great and bright and you can mix them to make the other colors. They smell great, and the three bottles lasted me a year. My three year old and 18 month old love them. They are alot better than these small ones."
1,Stained my washcloth,"Along with many others, I found the colors to be almost nonexistant unless you used half the bottle. I also could not understand the stain on my new yellow washcloth. It took repeated washing and pre-soaks to remove the stain. Today my granddaugher dropped an opened blue bottle on the yellow carpet. After pre-treating and 3 washes, the stain has still not been removed. Not the best product I've ever tried! Almost the worst!"
1,Is this invisible paint?,"I've read the other reviews and perhaps some of us have purchased faulty sets. I bought the set with just the paints and foam fish, and the ""paints"" don't show up at all. I might as well hand my kid a bottle of colored shampoo and say, ""here, smear it on the shower walls."" It would be just as fun and cheaper. What a crock. Unless there is a pair of special glasses out there we're supposed to have--or a black lite--lemon juice?... Oh well, I'm e-mailing the company!"
3,Somewhat of a waste,"The amount of ""paint"" was pretty minimal given the amount needed to really make designs or pictures. The palette ""hand"" was a waste entirely. It isn't meant to float, its too big for the side of the tub or the corners of it and not many toddlers are going to want to finger paint and have the coordination to do so without tipping it over.My son found this to be fun, I found it to be a waste of money in terms of length of play. Bathtub crayons last longer, are less costly and have more options."
1,THIS IS NOT A PAINT SET AS DEPICTED!!!!!,"The box clearly shows a child fingerpainting on the shower wall....in no way could we make this happen. This stuff is like soap and smears around, do not buy for this reason or I hate to say I told you so.""Alex bathtub fingerpainting kit"" I don't know how much clearer it can be that it's a fingerpainting kit, but in no way shape or form is it a fingerpainting kit.There are ZERO instructions in the kit, only a brief notation that it may not come off on porous surfaces on the box and the bottles.DO NOT BUY THIS!!!"
2,Doesn't work as advertised,"A lot of people who like this product seem to be using a paintbrush. I'll have my 2-year-old son try that tonight to see how it works. But as for using fingers, forget it. The paint is a slippery jelly that does not adhere to the walls or tub, and once mixed with water it becomes to faint to see. The only real fun he had was smearing a ton of paint on the back of the fish sponge and scrubbing the walls.There might be some potential here, but to see his excitement dashed as the product just didn't work was really disappointing. If the paintbrush doesn't help, were sticking to tub crayons."
3,Loved by 3 year old boy - if not used as intended,"My son asks for this every tubby... although he has never used as finger paints. He has drawn one or two lines on the wall, but it doesn't stick very well... so he just leaves it in the ""hand"" until it is time to wash up and then giggles as I pour it on him.The sponge is nice and the paint washes off the tile and grout easily as long as you don't let it dry... Then it still comes off but takes more elbow grease.The biggest problem is that you can't get refill paint. They have a refill set but it is only 3 colors."
3,Leave these on the shelf - go for the crayons!,"I bought the finger paints and crayons, but at first opened only the paints. They were runny, and barely left a sign on the bathroom tiles or bathtub. The idea was fun for the kids, but they too were disappointed when they couldn't do more than smear the runny paint with their hands (if they managed to catch it before it spilled into the bathwater). On the other hand, the crayons were great - the kids used them to draw, print letters, etc. and they were useful more than once. Go for the crayons, leave the paints on the shelf!!"
2,Not For the Tub,"This paint set is meant to be used in the bath tub by a preschool aged child. It is completely useless unless the palette, the child's hands, and the wall are COMPLETELY dry. If there is any wetness the paints are too runny to work. Who would expect a preschool child to go through such lengths to paint with a product that is SUPPOSED to be used in the BATHTUB??? It is like painting with water or disappearing ink.If you use a dry paintbrush on a dry surface with paint from a pallette being held by dry hands you get almost acceptable colors.Since I cannot find the company's website, I plan to write them a letter of complaint to the address on the box. What a waste of money."
2,finger paints,I was very disapointed with the bathtub fingerpaints. They did not paint at all. My 2 and 6 year old were very excited to try iy in the tub but lost interest right away when the colors did not come out.
2,"Fun, but we couldn't see the colors","Like others said, the colors were faint and hard to clean. Get bath crayons instead, they are a lot better."
2,bath finger paints not as good as bath crayons,These bathtub fingerpaints colors are not nearly as vibrant as the two different bathtub crayons I also purchased and not nearly as much fun for my 20 month old. He loves to write on himself and the tub with the crayons but the paints are much too thin to really even see.
2,Falls below expectations,Pass on this one - it's a great idea but the colors are runny and not very vibrant. The soap also stings when it gets in the eyes and gave my child a rash.
3,Not really paint...,"When my daughter received this as a gift for her birthday, she and I were both excited. She really likes coloring and painting and her bathtime. The paints smell great, and the fish and hand are substantial. Unfortunately, the paints are really poor. They barely leave a colored streak on our white ceramic tub. I was really disappointed in that. Thankfully my daughter doesn't mind, but I doubt I'll buy this product in the future."
2,could be better.,I bought these thinking that we would be able to play in the bath-tub; however the paint is barley visible. My child was still interested in smearing it all over the wall but I expected more.
3,Cheaply made but fun,"The paints are more like colored soap, when you squeeze the bottles to get the paint out it comes out both sides or the top and makes a mess, but its just soap so not a big deal. However my daughter loves them. She always asks for her paint in her 'hand' when its bath time. So bad quality but makes my kid happy, worth it."
3,paints are dull,"When you paint with these, the colors barely show up, the paint is not thick enough."
2,Completely Disappointed,"This is NOT paint, it is soap. Which would be fine if it had some kind of paint-like consistancy, but it does not. The picture on the box is totally misleading, because it shows a shower wall with all kinds of things drawn in brght, bold colors... and this is impossible with the ""paints"" in this set. The soaps colored the bath water nicely, but that's about all, had not even the decency to make bubbles to play with. We were both sad because we'd been so excited about this gift to our two year old, and he played with it for about a minute before getting frustrated and opting for something else."
3,Nice Birthday Gift,I purchased this a a gift with some clothes for my 2 year old niece. The kids loved it but it was really a one or two use item (although 3 kids were playing with it in the tub). They enjoyed mixing colors and painting themselves. It is a fun little gift for the price-I wouldn't buy the more expensive version.
5,Invaluable tools for Organizational Planning,"I have had the opportunity to use the designs in this book over the past year. The designs or ""strategic activities"" are creative and guarnateed to advance the planning process for a wide range of organizations. The instructions have just the right amount of detail to adaquately prepare the facilitator. There is tremendous felxibility with each acitivity to accomodate longer or shorter amounts of time. The designs arecrip, imaginative, thoughtful, rooted in practice. Its a book I refer to again and again. Its been an invaluable tool to my work."
4,"A fascinating way to plan,you have made it interesting","I really like this book. Although this is a long book, it is well worth the effort. There arelgreat ideas, that you can use in a variety of ways. My organization does a lot of planning, little of it is well done or interesting to our employees. This book gave us ways to involve our people and make it more meaningful. Most importantly, they take the mystique and complexity out of planning and show you how to get real results."
5,A Creative Book on Planning !! Finally it's here!,"What a pleasant surprise, a book on planning that is interesting and imaginative. The authors are great at explaining how to make planning interesting and involving. A colleague suggested I read this book and I'm glad she did. I use these ideas in planning and in everyday meetings. The book is expensive!but I must say it is worth it. One of the best books I have read in this field."
1,Worthless,"This book is an unstructured, incoherent collection of meaningless motherhood tools and techniques.The methods and processes proposed in this book will underwhelm all but the most stupid.Our group has read this book a number of times searching for the ""high impact"" - we have given upIn summary - low level, motherhood, devoid of frameworks - avoid at all cost"
1,Too simplistic.,"Even popular textbooks in strategic management (Wheelen and Hunger, Davis, etc.), which are oriented toward more thoughtful study of the subject, do a better job presenting a sound applied process in strategic planning. Don't waste your money."
5,surprised by a bagless,"our good old hoover windtunnel self-propelled gave out on us after 4 years of service. Although I was happy with this vacuum, I did not want to shell out another $300 to have it replaced. After reading the reviews, I decided on the vision dirt devil canister and am very pleased with my decision. It is very efficient with cleaning (sucks up ALL the dirt), relatively quiet (compared to my old hoover),cheap (1/3 of the cost of the windtunnel) and is light and easy to operate. I have yet to find anything wrong with it and would recommend it."
3,It kept shocking me!,"It came broke the first time, and the second time it proceeded to shock me consistently everytime i turned it on."
2,Nice looking but not so easy to use,"The overall design of this vaccuum looks great, but not so easy to use. With little attachments provided, all I can use it for is vaccuuming the carpet. Also oftentime when I tried to pick it up to move to a different spot, I mistakenly pull off the canister cover instead of vaccuuming itself."
2,Not pleased!,"Definitely defeats the purpose of being bagless... I'd love my old bag vacuum back again! It's extremely messy to clean. Every time I vacuum I have to try to clean most of the dust that accumulates in the filter, or the engine whines and the suction is lost. I've gone through two replacement filters so far. It works great the first time you vacuum after replacing the filter, but quickly get clogged up again, and it's really difficult to get it clean enough to work properly again. My other complaints are that the plastic hose crimps constantly, the attachment compartment is poorly designed and hard to open, and the handle to the dust compartment is right below the handle to carry the vacuum, making it easy to try to pick it up with the wrong handle, and either drop the vacuum, or spill dust everywhere. I bought this based on the good reviews... now I wish I had payed more attention to the poor ones. Buyer Beware!"
3,Good moral book!,"The Saddle Club's retired competive rider friend Kate Devine meets a challenge that may change her life. Kate rides in a show on a champion horse. She loves riding and she loves her horse. However, she learns competive riding just isn't for her."
4,"I very rarely give highet mark, but it's almost there","This is a classy media cabinet. I alreay have four and needed two more (I'm a major DVD collector) and the fact that they deliver it right to your door is wonderful. (The other ones I bought were from other stores and I had to get them in the back of my vehicle and haul them. At least not all at the same time!) They go great in the family room, den, library, etc."
2,Damn,Its only ok because it drys out my scalp. They stopped making my shampoo from universal medical so this was a try it shampoo. Im already looking for another shampoo. Its just not for me.
5,All The Da Vinci code wanted to be - and wasn't,"Mixing the esoteric, the scientific and the the philosophic in a thriller exquisitely written, where ideas ase deeply explored and the characters are interestng and intriguing. A masterpiece!"
2,Not worth the effort,"What could have been an interesting plot - it sounds like a Tim Powers novel when described - wasted by horribly shallow, one-dimensional and utterly unsympathetic characters. I managed to drag myself through it, but the conclusion was ultimately unsatisfying, the turn-arounds in the characters unexplained an unbelievable. Don't bother."
4,When physics meets Jewish mysticism,"I happened upon this book browsing at the local bookstore and killing some time before a meeting. Once I started reading I had a hard time putting it down, which didn't help me get through a rather dull meeting. Anyways, the author did a great job of tying together the diverse cast of characters as well as creating a unique twist to the relationship of physics/ philosophy/ religion. It does tend to lag at certain points, especially when detailing out some of the physics portion, but otherwise the author does an excellent job moving the story forward. Definitely worth the read."
5,I usually don't read fiction but this book amazed me!,"As a non-fiction reader I find it hard to stick with a novel, even if it is very good, but this book had me after the first page! Jane Jensen writes with such a unique perspective, clear insight, and imaginative presence! I cannot say enough good about this book and how it makes the reader look at his world through a different lens. There are very few novels that I can muddle through but this novel captured my attention all the way to the conclusion! Excellent and distinguished writing!"
4,A worthy read,This author uses some interesting literary tools to unfold her story. It makes for an interesting read. You won't be disappointed.
5,"Meaty, intelligent, and transcends ""the box""","I really enjoyed this book - one of my favorite books now. It was well-researched, interesting, and it combined both scientific and religious detective work. The result was a pretty far-out story that remained entirely feasible. Excellent, creative work."
2,Ignorance taints good intentions,This very thin book appears to be an attempt to present anelememtary and forthright history of the evolution of nuclear scienceand its technological products. Nice idea. The books 'my weeklyreader' style has the charm of simplicity and its lack of morarlizing is refreshing but the glaringly inept and laughable explanations of certain basic nuclear processes cast doubt on the scholastic integrity of the authors and attentiveness their publisher. Too bad. They had a nice start. END
5,What a fun Christmas album!,"I purchased this over 10 years ago when I was in college. I had been a cow collector for several years prior, and when I saw this at the local music store, I HAD to get it. Needless to say, I now teach 5th & 6th grade students who LOVE to hear my Cow Christmas cassette during the holidays. Many of them who know I have it because I taught their older siblings, so they ask about it in August. There is only one song that I really don't care for since I'm a big fan of opera style music. However the rendition of ""Carol of the Cowbells"" is awesome! The kids's favorite is the ""12 days of Christmas"" - Cow style of course!"
5,Loose definition for &#65533;meatless&#65533;,"This is a decent collection of non-red meat recipes. Hewitt has a very relaxed definition for ""meatless"" that seems to include both chicken and fish. The book is divided into chapters covering appetizers, soups, fish, chicken, vegetables, and salads. It also includes an appendix with some very useful metric conversion tables and an index. The recipes span the world, from Mexican to French, Turkish, Swedish, Japanese, and Indian. There are quite a few Italian and Greek recipes. This is a cook's workbook rather than a dreamer's coffee table book, since descriptions before each recipe are terse and there are no pictures. If you're a white-meat vegetarian, or simply looking for new ideas for serving chicken, fish, or beans, you'll find some interesting recipes in this book."
4,Catholicism - Taking a Second Look,"The book, Catholicism: Now I Get It by Claire Furia Smith, is an excellent presentation of basic questions in the Catholic Church concerning beliefs and practices. Smith does an great job of explaining them (or talking things over)to contemporary persons in contemporary language. She uses her own experiences and modern day references to get at the wisdom of the Catholic Church and the wisdom of living it out in our times.It is a good ""conversational"" approach to Catholicism for both Catholics and those who are not Catholic to be able to better ""get it"" -- Catholicism -- in a combination of wisdom, practicality and humor. Well worth reading and hanging on to as a referece. A good buy for younger and older pesons -- for personal reading and for group sharing."
1,THIS CD IS A COMPLETE BUST,"When i heard about this cd i was excited, because I am a Beegie Adair fan. I have all Beegie's cds and i was hoping this cd would measure up to what i have grown to expect. The concept of this cd was good, adding sax to her trio. The problem i have with this cd is that the sound is terrible. It seems that their is a constant contrast between the sax and Beegie's piano. They are both trying to out compete each other for the spotlight. There is no smoothness in the music. Also i didn't think the song selection was that great. I know this project should have worked, becasue i have other cds of this nature that sound beautiful with this combianaton. All i can say is this, that Beegie should stick with her beautiful trio. It is a masterpiece."
2,It cuts well but has rusted!,It cuts well as I expected but has rusted in one month!I would not buy this again. My brother bought a shears ... and it works fine. No rust until now.
3,REVIEW UPDATE,"My original review of this item was very negative. However, after using the item for several months, I feel I should modify what was a bad first impression. The marker does work well, if handled carefully. Changing label cartridges is tricky, and jams are likely unless you are careful. My original criticism of too much wasted plastic still stands. I think Brady could do better than this."
1,What happed to Kitchenaid quality?,"This machine would get 4 or 5 stars if it didn't break within a week or two of use.I purchased the Artisan for Christmas 2005. It failed (gears froze) a week after receiving it. The replacement unit failed on it's second use. I am now awaiting my third replacement.Kitchenaid sends a replacement in 5 days and picks up the failed unit. That is good customer service. However, each unit has failed within short time, if the third one fails, I will request my money back and purchase a different brand.Update March 2008: The third mixer was the charm. It's been working perfectly. Sorry to be so late getting back on this.Update Sept 2009: The third mixer is starting to act up. The stirring blade is bumping the side of the bowl. You can see the mechanism is not spinning properly any longer. Only a little over a year and now it needs repair. No quality here. When it works, it's wonderful. But 3 times means you're out."
1,KitchenAid has gone way down hill,"My wife & I got this as a wedding gift 3 years ago. My mother had this same mixer for over 25 years. We have always thought KitchenAid was the best brand you can buy. -Wrong! maybe 20 years ago. We use this mixer at most a couple times a month for light duties. After 3 years, the PTO on the front used for the attachments quit working. I was shocked to see it only had a 1 year warranty! It is because they make them cheap now, and probably in china. Like most US appliance companies, they are riding on their reputation in the past as a quality product, but make cheap garbage these days. Be aware if you buy this unit, it is half the product it used to be."
1,"This one was a ""lemon""","I was excited to own the Kitchen Aid Artisan Mixer. Several of my friends own this Kitchen Aid Mixer. Also, many of the Food Network cooks use this mixer. I used the mixer a few times the first year after I purchased it.Due to an unfortunate situation, I didn't bake or use my Kitchen Aid Mixer from Feb. 2007 until Feb. 2008. The mixer sat idle. When I tried to use it this year, the motor would only work on high settings and then for only a few seconds. I contacted Kitchen Aid and they reminded me that my warranty is over. I explained the mixer was hardly used. It seems like I really got a bad product. Kitchen Aid states that they stand behind their products. They didn't do well with this one. I wish I hadn't thrown away my very old mixer of 30 plus years, made by another manufacturer. It still worked."
3,Amazon Constantly Changes prices!!!,"I have been thinking about buying an Artisan for months. I finally decided, so I put it in my basket, and decided to check with my husband for a final decision about the color. A day later, the price jumped up almost $40! This is ridiculous. I think I'll buy it at Bed Bath and Beyond- at least they don't manipulate consumers as much!"
1,Box damaged in shipping,"Mixer was shipped in the factory display box by Fedex and was damaged in shipping , when mixer was delivered the Fedex person hid the hole in box to keep me from refusing delivery. If the shipper would have double boxed I would not have to give my wife a box with a 7 inch hole in the side of the box and not knowing if all the parts are there for the mixer. Just beware that Amazon does have good shipping!!!!!!!"
2,KitchenAid 5-Quart Mixer,I was delighted to get this quality appliance for such a great price. It was exactly what my daughter wanted. I'm still using my aunt's 20-year old KitchenAid.
4,"Stylish design, simple to operate","Delighted with this product. I went for the artisan kitcheaid over the kenwood because I knew my mixer would have to sit on the counter due to their heavy weight and if it has to be on show - the kitchen aid looks won hands down. I bought it from the states and after paying shipping and for a transformer to convert it to eureopean voltage, it was stil cheaper than buying it in Ireland."
5,KitchenAid KSM150PSBU Artisan Series 5-Quart Great Price,"Great product, arrived in a good condition.If you see the price at $199, that is the lowest I have seen in awhile.Price varies depending on the color of mixer, check the drop down to see the different prices."
5,Why did I wait so long?,I wish I would have bought one 20 years ago. I love it! Arthritis makes tradition mixing by hand very painful. This is a godsend.
5,My wife loves it,My wife has used this more than anything else in the kitchen. she said it was the best birthday gift I ever gave
4,Great Kitchen Gift,I have to admit to a serious bias; I LOVE kitchen Aid products. I love cooking and this mixer was definitely the ultimate in a group of great gifts. When it arrived from VenTribe.com the first thing I did was put it through it's paces. I'm a home made pizza kinda guy and this thing worked the dough like a charm. Very satisfied
5,Love it.,"I love my new KitchenAid Artisan. I find that it does any task faster and better than I could do with my old, handheld mixer. The power of the machine is more than adequate for the batch sizes I work with in my home cooking. It is heavy, so it has a permanent home on my counter top, which is fine since I use it a lot. Besides, it is so pretty!"
1,"Pay for the Full Model, not the Artisan","The Artisan mixer just doesn't compare favorably to the full-size version. It has the same capacity, but the size of the housing isn't big enough to handle the motor. Any speed over medium causes the machine to rock back and forth. The metal ring above the mixing piece comes loose and often times will fall into the mixing bowl, along with metal grease. Also, the motor will occasionally begin to smoke and smell when trying to handle things like kneading dough. Stay away from the Artisan and spend the extra money for the full version - I wish I had."
3,Not happy with the bowl lift,"We got a refurbished one from Amazon. Didn't know that there were two options, bowl lift, and tilt head. I'd get the tilt head if I were to buy another one... We got the bowl lift one and it's a real headache to put it on and off. And to add more ingredients, it's a real hassle if you have it operating as there is very little room to work. The mixer is also kind of noisy, as the metal beater hits the metal bowl on the sides, but also, the beaters don't hit all the way to the bottom, so you have to be careful and make sure that the doe has been completely mixed. I was really looking forward to having my real KitchenAid Mixer, but sometimes, I just go with my little manual 7 speed one. But what is true is that it's super powerful, convenient and you can do other things as you have it on, as the mixer won't move!"
5,great mixer,"You can't go wrong with a Kitchenaid mixer. I love this one in particular because it is red. I bought the red cover to go with it, and it looks great. I have some of the additional attachments which work great. Amazon has the best prices and prompt shipping. I have also bought the Kitchenaid hand mixer from Amazon. I can't think of a negative thing to say about this mixer or my experience with Amazon. I am a very happy customer!"
5,Kitchenaid is the Best,You can't purchase a better brand than Kitchenaid and you can't get it at a better price than on Amazon. Factor in the free shipping and this is a deal not be passed up!
5,Love it,"I have wanted this machine for a while. Amazon has the best price around. It works just as I had hoped it would. I made pizza dough w/ it so far, and it turns out great, even w/ my own handmade recipe."
5,Having fun in the kitchen,"The Kitchen Aid Mixer was a gift for our daughter for Christmas. We had a hard time trying to find the color(Pistachio). My husband had ordered one from another site and at the last minute we were told it wouldn't be available until after Christmas. Fortunately, I received an email from Amazon on that same day offering the availability of this same exact mixer. We had it just in time for Christmas. She loves the mixer. She has been making ice cream with the new ice cream attachment and she has been doing lots of baking."
5,Best mixer ever,I enjoy my new Kitchenaid stand mixer very much. It it is so easy to use.It does so much more things than any mixer that I have ever had. It looks great on my new counter and is so convenient to use.
5,Bakers Dream,"Once again, Amazon comes thru with the best prices, this KitchenAid mixer is great, I go to department stores to view products, and buy on Amazon. My wife is churning out baked goods like the Wonder bread factory."
4,Highly Recommended,"Amazon has great service and this mixer is a great product. How did I do without it for so long?? Expensive - yes, worth it - YES!Now I want to try some attachments.Kathy in Connecticut"
5,Cant do without this,As a baker I can honestly say that this is the one product in my kitchen I could not live without. Very quality design and easy to clean. Everyone knows about this so I would go nuts describing. But to all you new bakers out there just buy it.....you wont regret.
4,Very Happy,I replaced my Mother's Mix Master after 60 years of good service.I am very pleased with my new KitchenAid. I like how well it mixesthe bater and it is easy to clean. I received my $30 rebate so it was agreat buy from Amazon.
4,NO REBAIT,MIXER IS GREAT AMAZOM OFERED REBAIT CUPON OF $30 BUT KITCHEN AID WON'T PAY IF BOUGHT ONLINE
4,great buy!,"bought this for my friend who likes to bake but finds kneading the dough tiring. this mixer is very powerful but easy to operate. we now bake pizza on a regular basis. plus, the rebate was processed in two weeks."
5,Fantastic mixer!!,"I have waited for this mixer for a few years. I didn't want to spend the money, so I figured I'd shop around. I couldn't find it under $250. for the red one. This Christmas I found it on a Friday sale with free shipping and a mail in for a free grater attachment ($50.value) I decided to purchase for me and I have been using it ever since. Smooth running, not too loud- I only wished I got it sooner, but I did get it for $239. total. I can't beat that price. Works like a charm. I have not made bread yet, but cookies, cakes, and brownies for school and church events. I don't have one thing to complain about. If you want one--get it! It is definitely worth the money!!"
5,As Advertised!,"I always wanted one of these, but never wanted to pay for it. But... while making Holiday Cookies this year, my wife killed our ""cheap"" mixer. While doing some research online, I found numerous dicounts and even some good prices. By Far... Amazon was the cheapest.The mixer came in 1 day even with the free Super Saver shipping. Awesome! The mixer is so powerful. We use it for everything from baking to making mashed potatoes for dinner.I would recommend this to anyone... especially at Amazon's prices."
5,the best choice I ever made.....,".....was to purchase the kitchenaid appliance.With 4 kids and a husband I'm in the kitchen alot!! Now I have more free time and the kids can help without any mess or fuss. Chocolate chip cookies from scratch, mixed and baked in 30 min flat and I'm talking 4 dozen deluxe cookies only in need of cooling. If you like to bake, cook from scratch, and/or have a large family this machine is a necessity. Thanks Amazon for making it possible!!! I couldn't afford retailer prices. It's a long awaited dream come true."
4,Good mixer,"This was quite a bit cheaper than in Canada.Although i am not much of a cook or baker, this item looks sweet on the counter. I am quite happy with it.I would have liked it to have been shipped in a separate box. Instead the shipping label was stuck right on the front of the box and it came somewhat damaged.I would have to think twice before ordering this as a gift."
3,Kitchen Aid 5 qt. mixer,"This mixer is beautiful. I got the cobalt blue one and I love it. As far as the functionality of it goes, I would rate it at about a 3. The reasons are:1. When I doubled a recipe I have for chocolate chip cookies, the mixer gotvery hot and I worried about the motor seizing up.2. Filling it is a bit cumbersome.3. Because of the configuration of the bowl, you need to stop and scrapequite often in order to get the mixture to mix well."
3,Dissapointed in the Artisan,For the most part I have had great success with KitchenAid products. I purchased the Artisan before my Christmas baking for the increased power and bowl size over the KitchenAid Classic which I have had for well over 10 years. I immediately had to adjust the height of the beaters (which is supposed to be preset at the factory) because they were scraping the bottom of the bowl. This didn't work. I had already given my daughter my Classic so I was desperate for a good mixer. I took it to a repair shop to have a new bolt added because it was broken on the mixer I had ordered. I figured it would have taken a long time to send it off and receive a replacement. This seems to work OK but my Classic was still a better-made mixer.
5,A Great KitchenAid,A quality product that speaks for itself. Great pricing from Amazon which also included a rebate from KitchenAid. Looking forward to the many years of cookies and pie.
5,I LOVE IT!,This is a fantastic tool. I hate to cook but have been increasing my abilities in the baking arena and this makes it easy easy easy...it also looks good in my brand new kitchen.
5,Great mixer!,"I've had my mixer for about a month and really enjoy it! I knew I would and haven't been disappointed. Good price, good service and good product!"
1,Mixer Comes Loose,"We've had the mixer about a year. It's starting to wobble badly, and seems to have some loose screws inside. We're looking into the warranty situation, but my experience suggests you need to beware of the lifespan of this product."
1,Weak,"This machine is very weak. Started smoking after running for about 5 minutes trying to kneed bread dough. I replaced it with Delonghi DSM7 -- which is great so far. So, my advise; get this product only if you plan to use it for light duty mixing and whipping. ""You get what you pay for"" holds very true with this item."
4,Great for holiday cooking,"I rely so heavily on my mixer, I cook for a large group during the holidays and would be lost without the mixer, my only complaint is that it doesn't seem to hit the very bottom of the bowl so be sure to take a spatula to the bottom of the bowl to make sure everything is mixed in."
1,$50 per use is a bit much,"I use the big mixer only a couple times a year. While preparing a family dinner (5th or 6th use?) the mixer dumped oil in the mashed potatoes.I called customer support and was told this is normal. They said the grease separates and it's normal to drip 90 weight into your food. I thought I had a bad customer rep, so called again the next day, where I got basically the same answer. I asked for a supervisor who said I could ship it in for repair (at my cost for shipping and repair) and they would repair the unit.I was told it would probably happen again, unless I ran the unit at least once a month. Grease in your food is apparently a feature and support is not concerned."
2,Pity it's a piece of junk.,"We got one of these three years ago as a wedding present, and thought it would be a great appliance. However, as we've now found out, the internal gears are made of plastic, so when you use it to mix bread dough or something heavier than whipped cream, the gears strip. Ours isn't completely stripped, but it doesn't work near as well as it used to. Next time we'll buy something more durable. (If you don't believe me, Google 'Kitchenaid mixer problems')"
5,Love it,"This is the perfect mixer!!! I use it all of the time, I don't know how I lived without it. Thank you"
4,"good product, good price","We like this product, it is not as heavy as we think, very aesthetic has been working ok so far we would just like the complement items were not so expensive"
5,Product and Amazon service great; shipper irresponsible,"The product is wonderful! It works great and handles everything from cake batter to whole grain yeast bread. The only problem I had was with the shipper. FedEx left the large package covered with a plastic bag, open at the bottom, on a very stormy day in a puddle. Needless to say, the box was soaked by the time I got home in the afternoon. However, as soon as I called Amazon, they arranged for a replacement to be sent and sent a return label so I could ship it back. I received the replacement within a week."
5,Great Mixer,Bought this mixer for my wife for christmas. No regrets my wife loves it and uses it all the time. Amazon's shipping was excellent had the mixer before the original ship date and it was free. Got a great deal as well $250.00 versus Kohl's $300.00 + tax. All around great product and price.
5,Works for me,"I bought this appliance only to make a particular African dish.It works fantastic.I also got the food grinder attachment free with mail-in rebate, and it is a terrific add-on. I am using it more than I thought I would. I use it to grind beef and chicken (for some thai dish I sometimes make). Well, I will never buy ground meat ever again. At least, not with this baby in my kitchen. :)"
5,Fabulous! Use it everyday![.],I love the 5 quart Artisan KitchenAid Mixer. Very glad I took time to choose a fun color. It is useful and beautiful in my kitchen!
1,I hate it!,"I hate my expensive Kitchenaid mixer, it is so poorly designed!!! The only good thing about it is the bowl is deep. Everything about it makes it difficult to put in the ingredients and that is w/o the shield! The shield/chute is impossible. I am so sorry I bought it, I am glad that I got a good deal from Amazon or I would be sick over it."
1,Make preparations for another purchase.,"Please, do yourself a favor and DO NOT BUY a KitchenAid Mixer. We purchased one for my wife and this unit was used 4 times before it quit working. We had contacted KitchenAid/Whirlpool about this failure and were told that nothing could be done as it had been outside of the 1 year warranty. It was 1yr. and 3 days to the date of purchase. So for the 3 days of ""extra"" warranty I was asking for, this company chose to ignore the customer. I will, NEVER purchase an item from KitchenAid/Whirlpool again. I wish everyone who owns on the best of luck but be prepared to spend more money soon."
1,What happened to USA quality built stuff?,"This one appears to be possibly used because ""new"" out of the box it has grease leaking from the planetary assembly's shaft, and the whisk is corroded. Maybe its not used, but very poor quality controls. The whisk seriously looked like it had been outside for a month. Also the manual states that cleaning it in a dishwasher can cause ""discoloration"", AKA corrosion, so it may have been used, sent back and resold.And exactly why can't KitchenAid seal the shafts on these so their ""food grade grease"" (LMAO) can't get out and contaminate food with the grease and metal from the gears? Cars have had rubber grease seals for how long?Disappointing workmanship from something made in the USA. I expect better quality from American made stuff."
3,Product is ok but never recieved the advertised $30 rebate,"KitchenAid should abandon the ranks of rebate companies and simply offer the product at the rebate price at the time of sale. Rebates create poor product sentiment. After going through all the annoyance of filling out forms, cutting out the UPC code and sending everything in 9 months ago, never heard anything else. I'll probably look for a vendor who uses straight forward pricing the next time. Rebates are often a scam and certainly not intended to be customer friendly."
1,So disappointing,"I replaced my beloved 20 year old KitchenAid stand mixer a couple of years ago with this model and I'm tempted to get the old one, which is still going strong, back from my daughter. About the only thing it does well is spray flour out of the bowl - even on the stir speed with the shield on. I bake often and it can't handle the heavier bread and cake doughs. There are dead spots where the beater doesn't reach, so the flour is never fully incorporated. It vibrates so much that the bolt holding the head on slides out and the cover for the attachment receptacle falls into the batter on a regular basis. The shaking also causes the bowl to become wedged into the bottom slots, so only my 6' husband can pry it loose. It may be prettier than the old one, but it can't come close in performance."
1,This machine is a piece of junk!!,"I bought a kitchenAid stand mixer for light use at home to make cookies and now the machine is leaking oil. Apparently this is a common problem because if you search the internet about this machine leaking oil you will find several blogs where hundreds of people complain about it. Please do research about this machine before you buy it. By the way, my daughter just got one for xmast and hers is also leaking oil. Check out this site and you'll see how common this problem is and how the Kitchenaid company refuses to fix this problem. [...]"
3,"Great mixer but for making cake only, not work well with attachments.","When I received this mixer, I saw two small cuts on the body, but I still keep it because that's just cosmestic. This is great mixer for making a cake or any pastries. I bought this mixer and some attachments such as sausage stuff, meat grinder, shreader and I tried all od these functions. I realized that this is good for making a cake or anything about pastry. Those attachemnts wroked alright, but they are really slow and the mixer will get hot very soon. If you expected use this mixer to grind meat or make sausage, I think you should buy the professional ones."
4,Great mixer.,"This is a great mixer with a lot of options and accessories that make it a good value. Only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is because of the way it was packaged--it came with a couple of big white scuff marks which more-or-less buffed out but are still visible. Not a problem as it relates to functionality, but when you give it as a gift, the big obvious marks lessen the happy-gift factor."
5,Lifetime,"I love my mixer. KitchenAid has a long standing history of being reliable, sturdy, and long lasting. It is a must buy."
5,So Far ....So Good...,I think the machine is great.. But the attachments are very wimpy... I purchased the attachment pack...It's ok but not many recipes.. I think my dough hook bend out of shape..
5,Best mixer for home/amateur use,"I love this mixer. I don't own any of the attachments yet, but I use it often!"
5,Great Mixer,This is a great mixer at a great price. I'm very happy with it and would recommend it to anyone.
5,KitchenAid Artisan mixer,"This was a gift for my Mother. She has wanted a kitchenAid mixer for several years now, but was just too frugal to buy one for herself when she already had a mixer that worked. She always commented on mine when she was at my home. My parents have a lot of the Blue Willow China so I thought this was an appropiate color choice. She loves it!"
5,Best Mixer Ever!!,"This is the perfect mixer for the average household. Big and powerful, but not huge. It's perfect for mixing everything from meatloaf to cookie dough. Easy to clean, but it does take some room to store."
5,Love the mixer and great price from Amazon!,"I've been wanting this stand mixer for a long time and finally was able to get it thanks to the deal I received from Amazon - $239.99 + free shipping. This mixer has met my high expectations and looks great in my kitchen. I purchased the Gloss Cinnamon color and I love it! I was worried at first that it might look like a brownish red due to the ""cinnamon"" description, but the color shown by Amazon is spot on. It's a beautiful berry wine color. I have already received my free slicer/shredder attachment from KitchenAid too."
4,artisan kitcheaid mixer,"I bought this item, a wedding gift for my daughter, for next fall.I was given one 35 years ago. Mine is much sturdier, much better mechanical and machine body.I was dissapointed Kitchenaid has gone the way of most manufacturers today, cheap.I took it out of the package to be sure it worked. Other than that, I can't say much about the performance, as I haven't actually used it. But, the price was right and the seller was a speedy shipper."
4,"KitchenAid *used* to make the best mixers, but I'm not sure now. . .","I'm giving this mixer only 4 stars because of the problems we had getting a working one. The first one never operated right; it eventually smoked, sparked and blew a fuse. Repeated attempts to deal with KitchenAid directly were highly unsatisfactory--reps kept promising to fix it and then did nothing. Amazon did the right thing; they made returning the defective mixer easy and immediately replaced it with a new model. P.S. We're still trying to get our Rebate/Free food grinder from KitchenAid (Boo!)."
5,Great Mixer!,I have had it for 3 years now and it is still working just like it did brand new! I use it mostly for breads.
5,Love my new mixer,"Shopped for two months for a new mixer to determine what features I wanted. Had my old one for 25 years before it stopped working in the middle of my husband's banana split pie (which takes 15 minutes of heavy mixing. This one has everything. Easy to use, not too heavy to cart back and forth from the pantry, clean up is a breeze, And of course the price was terrific on Anazon. The sale price only applied to the white model, but that was fine with me since I keep it in the pantry most of the time. The service and shipping, which was free, was seamless. Again, great product for a great price."
5,Mixer Review,"This product was in excellent condition, just as described. It was delivered fairly quickly. No problems, great buy!!"
5,Where were you all my life?,"Just got my beautiful KitchenAid stand mixer in empire red & I am in love with it. I have only made a cake so far but will be making bread today. I have always done lots of baking & sure could have used this long ago. It takes alot of the work of mixing out of the baking process. Get one soon, you won't be sorry."
5,very great!!!,"it was very appreciated! it help me a lot on my baking, easy to clean and the power is very strong."
4,Great Mixer,This is the second Kitchen Aid mixer I have owned. The last one I had for over twenty years and never had a problen with it. Hope this one is as good. So far it works perfect. Dealing with Amazon was great! It shipped before they said it would and it was received in perfect condition. Would not hesitate to deal with Amazon again.
5,Outstanding Stand Mixer,"This is a quality product and I was able to purchase it at a great price with free shipping to boot. I expect this to be one of the most valuable appliances in my kitchen and I know it will outlast any other I presently own--a good-looking appliance, too!Can't wait to add the accessories to take advantage of all of its capabilities..."
5,cooking,Amazon is great. My mixer arrived in one week. I have only used it a couple of times but I know I am going to love it.
3,"Mixer mixes, but also groans & it takes work to get the crud off.","This mixer has a pour shield, but it is very clumsy to use & almost as much work as pouring directly into the mixing bowl. I love the handle on the mixing bowl, but I noticed that the mixer still requires a lot of scraping to get it to mix all ingredients.It also makes a lot of noise."
5,SUPER FOR THE PRICE!,After shopping all over town this mixer was the one I choose. Man am I glad I did. Super! Great quality and sturdy.Works fantastic!Shipping was super fast.
2,Scratched Kitchen Aid Artisan Series Mixer,"It was the Holiday Season so we didn't expect the Mixer to get here overnight, although it take longer than usual for it to arrive. However, when it did get here with some scratches on it, given its color and the fact the our kitchen is not the brightest, we didn't notice the blemishes until after my wife had been using it.My personal thoughts were that the packaging that the unit was shipped in was slightly damaged thus creating the scratches, it was obvious the box did not appear to provide adequate protection during shipment of the unit.So far the machine has worked fine, but the craftsmanship seems far substandard to the one my grandmother used to have. I hate to say it, but it does looks cheap in its appearance and the quality, but so far it has performed without a problem."
5,How did I ever cook without it?,"I have owned this for 2 years now, and I'm wondering how I ever managed to cook without it! I absolutely love it. It's on my counter 24/7. From meat loaf to cookies, this thing will do it all! I firmly believe in this brand, and anything in my kitchen that is needing to be replaced, will be replaced with KA! (next thing is a food processor!!!)love it!"
5,My Oh My!!!!,"I am an ""older adult"" who has NEVER owned a really good stand mixer. Always happy with a ""hand me down"", I never really was intersted in replacing my stand mixers until my last donation died. Why did I wait so long to purchase such an amazing appliance?? This purchase was primarily to make my own healthy breads, tired of kneading dough! I have made 10 various breads in the past month and all have been successful and delicious. So very easy to mix, knead and get them rising. I have no complaints thus far with the appliance nor do I have anything negative to say about delivery OTHER than it was delivered with no outer packaging and was left quite visible (KITHEN AID MIXER ETC CLEARLY MARKED ON THE BOX) at our outdoor entry. Glad we live in a quiet and safe neighborhood.....all in all, very happy so far with purchase."
5,KitchenAid Artisan Stand Mixer,This mixer is heavy duty and sensational looking. You can mix a small batch of cookies to a double batch and the mixer holds up to the task and more. I especially love to walk away and let the mixer do all the work! I'm thrilled I bought a KitchenAid.
5,AWESUM MIXER !!,"KitchenAid KSM150PSWH Artisan Series 5-Quart Mixer, WhitePURCHASED FOR A CHRISTMAS GIFT & WOULD DEFINATELY BUY ANOTHER ONE THIS IS ONE SUPERIOR MIXER & HAS THE ABILITY TO ADD ALLMOST ANY ATTACHMENT !!"
2,You'll also need a hand-mixer and a good repairman,"In the beginning, my KA worked very well for large batches of cookies and mixing huge cakes. HOWEVER it only worked for large batches. Things like pancake batter, a single coffeecake, 2 egg whites, and whipped cream don't have enough volume to mix in the KA. You'll need a handmixer if you don't want to stir those things up by hand.Another huge problem is that the thing broke. For the price of this KA, it should be reliable. Mine didn't even last a year, and I cannot find a repairman. Phone calls to KA yielded the information that I'd have to drive 3 hours over the mountains to get someone to look at it and see if it can be fixed. We can only use the mixer by constantly sliding the power level back and forth with one hand, while whacking the KA on the side with the other hand. My daughters are willing to do that, but I am not."
4,A gift for my brothers wife.,I can't say good or bad but from what I read on the internet it's a good bet she will love it. Hope she makes me pancakes with it some day.
4,Doing Fine,I've enjoyed the mixer. I've had it for two years now. I'm starting to hear the gears slip. One of my beaters is nicked. I'm pretty hard on it -- and make bread all the time (but never knead over a 2 speed).
3,I like this brand but...,Great mixer but what I didn't realise that the American electrics runs on 110 volts and the rest of the world has 240 volts. I had to buy a steep down converter... It works fine but there was no warning on amazon to say that the item was 110 volts... Silly me...
4,"Wife loves the color, and that's pretty much all that matters, right?","Bought this restored from the Amazon Warehouse Deals, and it seems to work great, though rattles slightly. The color is exactly as it looks in the picture, which is of course the most important thing to my wife (she loves it)."
1,Stay Away From Whirlpool Products,Whirlpool does not stand behind its expensive Kitchenaid products. Their president is extremely rude and sends out nasty messages if you e-mail him for assistance. Don't get ripped off like we did.
1,Piece of junk,The gear can not lock together after 2 month. Then the whole machine became useless. I returned it to Costco. The gear of pasta make I bought also broke because of the plastic material they. Don't buy it.
2,All that metal and I stripped the gears on the 2nd recipe.,First batch of cookies all was well. 2nd item I made was dough for pretzels. The thing stopped made a snap and then a high pitch whine with no dough hook movement. I called Kitchenaid and having answered their questions to their satisfaction they sent me a new one. I am afraid it'll happen again. Wish I had bought some other brand.
4,LOVE IT!,"We really love this mixer! The only reason it didn't get 5 stars is because it is green not teal (as shown in the picture). Not a fan of the color, but it reminds me of my grandmother's mixer that lasted for decades. We have made cheesecakes, pies, bread, muffins, specialty crusts - you name it in the baking area, and this mixer has been a champ. Sorry I waited so long to buy it."
4,Great Mixer,"It has the power needed to mix heavy bread dough as long as no more than three loaves are mixed at a time. --too much flour can get doughy and move up the dough hook making a dough mess up the shaft of the blade if too much flour is in the bowl to mix at one time (not pretty). Plus it bogs down the mixer to mix too much. Otherwise all is good. I make alot of bread and needed something to handle the bulky mixing for me. This is just great for home use. More power would have been nice for a bread maker like me, but the price is good.Mixes other things in a snap...cookie, cakes, muffins, mashed potatoes......you name it."
5,Hooray for Amazon and Kitchenaid!!!,"I purchased this stand mixer as a Christmas gift for a friend of mine and it just arrived today! I got it for a steal, and it even arrived a few days earlier than expected! The Kitchenaid box inside is so bright and glossy and beautiful, I can't wait to see my friend's face when she tears through the wrapping paper! I'm very happy I ordered through Amazon. Amazon = GREAT SERVICE. Kitchenaid = AWESOME QUALITY PRODUCT."
4,Glad to Own this Mixer.,"My husband and I bought the artisan mixer and we have had it for over a year now. We have never had any trouble with it and we use it frequently. I love how it makes whip cream so thick and fluffy and we always use it for cookies, cakes, and creamy mashed potatoes. I have been pleased with this product."
4,Not entirely happy,"I have always used kitchenaid mixers, but I have to say this one is not what I hoped for. I made the decision to move up from my classic kitchenaid 250 watt motor to the Artisan 325 watt hoping for less drag on heavier doughs ex..cookies this one still drags and is actually a little bumpy. I guess I should have gone for the 525 watt motor. All in all the Artisan works great just not sure it was worth the extra money..I would recommend it with a caveat."
2,A dud Perhaps? I hope so,"I was excited when I received this mixer and instantly went to work marking a loaf of french bread. It used 4 cups of unbleached all purpose flour and did not exceed speed 2 with the dough hook. After about 2 minutes I see smoke rising from the machine. After owning the product for about 20 minutes, it broke.The mixer seemed strong and well constructed and the bowl fastened tightly. It appeared well built, so I hope that the motor in my unit was a dud.I will give their service department credit - after about 5 minutes on the phone I had another unit on the way to me. Unfortunately, I will have to wait again to test this product out."
4,Fantastic mixer,"This is a fantastic product, it arrived in a timely manner in perfect condition. It was purchased as a gift in the lead up to Christmas and arrived with plenty of time. It has already been used to mix delicious biscuits and cakes. Would highly recommend this to any budding chef."
4,Best mixer I've ever had,"I simply love this mixer! It's the best mixer I've ever had. Love its versatility and the color!The only reason why I'm not giving it 5 stars, is because of its weight. I wish Kitchen Aid could make improvements on that!"
5,Love the mixer and The Mixer Bible,I just got my new Artisan Mixer and I love it. I got it with The Mixer Bible and that was a good buy. Definetly go out and get the mixer and the book now if you are a baker or an avid cook!
5,I was so pleased I clapped,"I had waited years before I finally received my kitchenaid mixer. I actually clapped the first time I made something in it. I now find myself looking for things to mix in it that I wouldn't ordinarily do. This mixer is incredible - it made the fluffiest cheesecake I'd ever made, as well as some fantastic mashed potatoes. I even tried some of the recipies in the manual, and everything comes out great. Kneading dough is a breeze, and cookies are mixed in no time. I highly recommend this item."
5,LOVE LOVE LOVE my KitchenAid Stand Mixer,"I love to cook and my KitchenAid Stand Mixer has really made my life so much easier! For my baking needs, it saves me more than half the prep time compared to mixing things by hand. It kneads dough perfectly and saves me a lot of unnecessary energy and mess!I also purchased the meat grinding attachment, which is great. I like grinding my own meat because I know it's a lot fresher than the ground beef, pork, chicken etc at the store. Plus, I like to sometimes mix my meats together or grind a meat that you can't necessarily find at stores (ground lamb, ground shrimp, etc.)Plus, it's so adorable! It's a real statement piece for my kitchen and I love displaying it. I've had my for about a year now and I used it at least every two weeks. It's definitely worth the investment."
2,Very disappointed. No longer the old time quality product,"I am very disappointed in my Kitchen Aid 5 quart mixer. I make whole wheat bread from scratch every week and was so excited that my husband bought this for me. I really wanted a mixer that I could even pass on to my daughter and the only one with that reputation had been Kitchen Aid.After about a year it froze up suddenly and started making a horrid grinding sound. We called the company and they said to take it to an authorized repairman. When he opened it up we discovered why it broke. The gears inside are PLASTIC!!!! Kitchen Aid has kept the heavy metal exterior but hidden the fact that they have moved to PLASTIC gears. How long could that possibly last! Even after replacement, it continued to make a grinding noise and then permanently froze. No way was I going to spend another $90 for parts and repair."
2,Not up to scratch,First unit received was not complete. Replacement unit - no difference in actual speed for speeds 1 and 2 on speed dial - also locking lever travel was too short. Second item returned for credit. Same item from other stores also had some faults. Very disappointed with the quality of a reputed top-of-class machine.
5,"LOVE IT, CANNOT LIVE WITHOUT IT","I got mine when I got married. LOVE IT, CANNOT LIVE WITHOUT IT. Six happy years later and after daily use, it finally died on christmas eve 2002. (the mixer. really by my own fault...an accident by distraction) This is a fabulous appliance, it does it all. I use it for everything from cakes, breads and cookies to pasta and mashed potatoes. (also use the meat grinder attachment) It is like a second pair of hands in my kitchen. Without hesitation I purchased another. When my oven is on, the kitchen aid is whirring away. The cost is nothing when you truly love to cook and bake and use it. If you don't, why spend the money. I am repairing my other kitchen aid and giving it to my sister, who is learning to cook."
1,After only four years of use the appliance is defective!,What more can I say - when you pay almost $300 for an appliance you expect it to last longer than 4 years. It is no longer usable and I am disgusted with Kitchen Aid products. Patricia Nielsen
2,cornflower blue looks different in person!,"Beware, Cornflower blue looks more like periwinkle (light violet with a hint of blue). I was so excited about this color on line, but not thrilled when I look at in my kitchen. Plan to return it.I'm sure it works great, but I want a color that I enjoy seeing on my counter top every day."
2,Caviar Color,The photo of the caviar mixer does not show the true color. The actual color is a dark glossy gray with small metallic pieces (resembling glitter) mixed in. (I am returning it for a solid color).
5,oh man!,"Wow. This thing is seriously awesome. Yeah man, if I could afford one of these babies there's no end to what I would do! Yes, I sure would be cooking up a storm. Cookies, brownies and cakes...oh boy. Yeah, it'd sure be nice to own one of these bad boys. Man. It even comes in red?! Wow, that's so cool. I sure do wish I could get this."
3,MAKES A GREAT PROP,"The main reason I bought this mixer was because I wanted the whole retro-appliance look for my kitchen. I was actually less concerned with how it works.The ""ICE"" color is absolutely gorgeous. It's a pitch-perfect tint of 1950's turquoise--my new favorite color. It looks great with the pink Kitchenaid blender, which I also bought.I would have awarded 5 stars just for the look, but I have used the mixer, and while it does a good job so far, it is noisy. The low speeds have a particularly unsettling grinding sound to them. Evidently, this is common, reading the other reviews.The problem with residue on the sides and bottom is mostly fixed when the center screw is adjusted clockwise, tilting the angle of the beater downward. Still, it would be nice to have more flexibility when mixing instead of having to leave the bowl locked down.I hope KitchenAid makes all the color varieties available on all their appliances, not just the mixers."
5,On My Wish List FOREVER!!!!!,"I have wanted one of these babies since I don't know when!! I love to bake and set right to using this mixer as soon as it was unpacked. It is everything I dreamed of; easy to use, efficient, easy to clean. Can't wait to get more attachments for it. I bought the silver grey model as it will match any kitchen color - a classic. Keeping it on my counter. The mixer was wrapped well and there were no issues with missing pieces, damage, etc. I love ordering from Amazon as they are always reliable. I would recomend this to anyone who bakes. Can't wait until Christmas when I do my huge cookie batches; this year it will be much easier."
5,Pistachio Kitchen Aid 5 Qt. Mixer,I just love this mixer. It is very sturdy and dependable. I usually put everything in and turn it on. It's wonderful. Glad my kids thought enough of me to get it for me for Christmas!
5,Mom's Day Gift-Kitchenaid Mixer,This item was purchase to replace my mother's original 40 year old Kitchenaid that just died at Christmas. She loves the color and looks forward to using it often. The attachments fit perfectly.
5,Kitchenaid mixer,"This was a great machine with a great price. I have used it a lot and it works great - never gets bogged down and is a breeze to use in making frosting, fondant, cakes and all the rest! I highly recommend it to anyone who bakes a lot."
5,"Powerful Motor, Excellent Mixer","This mixer is excellent. It's powerful for hard to mix flour batches, and cleans in a breeze. It's one of the best things I ever bought to make cooking a lot easier, especially on my hands trying to mix everything. KitchenAid makes some of the best products and this mixer really does the job perfectly!"
3,When the mixer is a rockin'...,"I've waited a LOOONG time for a Kitchenaid mixer..and my time is finally here! I was like a kid at Christmas when I opened the box and pulled out MY shiny, red, beautiful Kitchenaid Mixer! I made muffins and cookies without any problem and was very pleased. However, when it came time to make rolls for Thanksgiving using the dough hook, I found that the lock didn't lock down the head tightly enough, and the head of the mixer was bouncing and bucking, causing the mixer to ""walk"" backward. I had to hold it down to keep it from bucking so hard and to keep it from walking right off the counter! My mother-in-law was here (she also has a kitchenaid mixer) and she said that while the mixer does get to ""rocking and rolling"" when she makes bread, what mine was doing was NOT right. Sadly, I packed it up and have requested a replacement..and it will be here in 2 days. First assignment..making bread!"
1,buyer beware,"I have had two empire red Artisan mixers in the past five years. They are gorgeous BUT both have suffered from the same three serious problems: 1. the slow speed burned out in the first month on machine number 2 when I kneaded soft brioche dough and now the mixer has only two speeds: fast and faster. 2. the mixing bowl sticks to the metal plate so that dislodging it requires a healthy husband or a liberal amount of WD40 or both. 3. the pin holding the armature to the base slides out when the machine gyrates, which it does something fierce when kneading for more than three minutes. This is one of the worst engineered products I have ever owned, and Kitchen Aid's service is not helpful. I'm going to buy a Breville next and abandon KA for good."
4,It's a HIT!,I got my sister this for her birthday and she literally screamed at the UPS guy when he delivered it (it wasn't wrapped). Score!
5,"Fantastic, Reliable and great Style","I bought this as a gift for my mom, as a replacement for her 20+ year old KitchenAid. She absolutely loves it, couldn't be happier. The size is perfect. The color and finish are perfect. As always KitchenAid come through. One of the best tools in the kitchen!"
5,Great price for a great item,"I love my mixer! It came gift wrapped, even though I bought it for myself. I've had no problems wit it and used quite a few times. I researched prices for weeks, no other place even came close to this low price!"
5,Catching Up with the Kids,"Most of our children already own KitchenAid stand mixers. I got tired of not being able to create the same great cooking sensations that they do so easily. The Buttercup color fits so well in our kitchen. By day two we were making homemade wheat bread. It was so easy. This truly is a remarkable, useful addition to our kitchen."
4,Minor problems...don't make them like they use to,"This mixer is basically a good model. I find it easier to use than my sister's which is the lift bowl type and I have problems getting to things to scrap in hers, but can easily tilt and scrap in mine. My old sunbeam, however, was not as deep and easier to scrap. It is a little noisier than expected, noisier than my old machine. The wire whisk can only be used for things like egg whites...I used it for batters because I didn't realize that and had to replace it because it went off balance and I could not get the wires to go back correctly. It also should be hand washed because any bouncing in the the dishwasher may affect the wires. I find the shield almost useless. I have not had any major problems."
5,KitchenAid 5 Quart Series Mixer Artisan,"Love it! Does it all. Buy a couple of attachments and you have the perfect machine! Love the color! Works great, no problems."
5,Excellent Quality and FUN to Use!!!,This KitchenAid product is made of extremely high quality material. It is fun to use and so easy to clean. I purchased this for my grandmother who is 81 years old and she has started baking again because she says it is more fun to bake with her new KitchenAid than to do anything else.
4,Great Gift for My GF,"Purchased this as a gift for my girlfriend and she loves it. The varying speeds work perfect for about any recipe. There are tons of attachments and ad-on's for this unit, and the price was great. If you look hard enough on amazon you'll find this model for about $70 cheaper than in the store. This allowed me to purchase a second mixing bowl made of glass with the money I saved. All in all a great purchase, and KicthenAid stuff always holds its value."
2,"Wish it was ""new""","I was so excited to receive this mixer! I'd wanted one for years. I opened the box and almost cried! It was scratched and scraped, but that's not the worst part. There was someone's food remnants still stuck in the bowl. I clearly got a used one. For as much as I paid, I expected atleast a NEW one. I won't even bother with a replacement from Amazon. I just want my money back. That's unsanitary and unethical."
5,Product speaks for it self,"This product speak for it self, quality builded in and live up to it. A reiable and dependable name band"
4,great mixer,i bought this mixer for my wife and she loved it. with all the different accessories it is really a great addition to any kitchen.
5,Kitchenaid Artisan,I love this mixer! It really saves you time and you don't feel chained to the counter.
3,Not for making bread!,"I purchased this mixer approximately 3 years ago and until today have loved it everyday since and would have given it 5 stars. Today while my mixer was ""attempting"" to knead bread (it has NEVER done a good job kneading bread!) I briefly left the room as I normally do. I re-entered room as I smelled smoke, noted smoke to be billowing out of the back of my mixer, and that the mixer continued to sound as if it was running while the dough hook was not moving. It is obviously past the warranty for this machine but one would expect a machine that costs so much to work much longer. If you are purchasing this mixer for any heavy-duty use or for use with whole wheat I highly recommend purchasing a stronger mixer! While I believe this mixer works okay for making a quick bread or a single loaf of white bread anything more appears to max out the motor. Bread is not really kneaded and is heavier than one would prefer. All in all a good mixer for cookies and other light use!"
1,kitchen aid mixer,"not good quality,When I got this product, I was so happy. However, I only used three times and this mixer was broken. I also found out it was used product so I decided to exchange another one from Amazon. But the second one is also brokedn again in the short time. I really don't know how to do with this product. Do I need to exchange another one or refund the money?"
5,My kitchenaid purchase,"This was one of my first purchases from Amazon and I was absolutely thrilled! I got a bargain, received the merchandise in one day and did not have to spend hardly any time shopping for this gift for my daughter for Christmas. I am waiting for this to go on sale again, so I can purchase one for myself!"
2,Disappointed,"I was so excited to get this mixer, I use them alot. Right away I didn't like that you have to hand wash the bowl and mixer, more work for me. Also it is loud and very heavy. I have arthritis and can not easily pick it up, but my husband couldn't either. So we had to find a place for it on the counter to stay which I prefer not to do. I used to take my other mixing unit out of the pantry to use. My old one was easy to put the ingredience in, this one is much more difficult.The controls are very stiff. You almost have to use two hands to have some control when using it. I was so disappointed with this unit, I wished I saved the money and just replaced what I had been using."
1,Color name is deceiving,"The poor rating is for color only (KitchenAid mixers are AWESOME!) The color name for the mixer I ordered is Cobalt Blue, which you would think would be somewhat, well, blue. Upon opening the box and setting it in the kitchen it ended up appearing very PURPLE. We moved it from inside lighting to outside, and yet still - purple. KitchenAid should look at a color palate of common known colors before naming a color. Cobalt blue is a deep bright blue often found in glass products like margarita glasses and tile."
2,Not what I had expected,"As with many of you, I have been wanting a KitchenAid mixer for years. When my husband finally broke down and bought me one, I was estatic until I tried to use it to make bread. The first thing I noticed is that it did not mix the bottom or the sides of the bowl. I had to scrape the sides multiple times. Once I added the flour, the dough kept creeping up the mixer into the gears. When I tried to make cookies, I did more hand mixing than electric mixing. I can't decide if the bowl is just too small for what I am trying to do, or if I just don't know how to use this mixer. Either way, it is not a good match for me and I am extremely jealous of all of those who absolutely love it."
3,Artisan was a disappointment,"After using a KitchenAid stand mixer for 20 years, I bought a new Artisan with a larger motor and bowl. This new one has a knocking noise (even though I tried adjusting the height screw) and it vibrates. I never had either of these problems with my old one. I was disappointed in the workmanship."
4,Kitchen-Aid Mixer,"I have no review presently for this product. It was a Christmas gift for my wife and as of this moment she hasn't used it. My biggest complaint and disappointment was that this item was delivered in it's normal packaging. It was ordered prior to the holidays and I thought it would be mailed in some sort of concealed plain brown box. Needless to say, when my wife arrived home from work one day to find the package at the front door, there would be no Christmas surprise. Otherwise I'm quite sure this is a great product. I have used a similiar Kitchen Aid mixer at my fire station and all of the firefighters seem to like how it works.Once again overall purchase okay. Delivery methods need improvement (consider time of year when product ordered)."
2,Great mixer!,"I waited and shopped around for this mixer. I knew I wanted one, but I wasn't sure about the price. I received it last week and am excited about trying knew recipes. What an awesome help in the kitchen. I am so glad I held off and bought a mixer with such high quality and a great reputation.Update: I have used his mixer several times and have been having trouble with it shaking. I have tried adjust the screw on top, but continue to have the shaking. I am sorry to say I am extremely disappointed."
5,Hand & Time saver,"The frist time I used a stand mixer was a few years ago. I borrowed one from my mother inlaw.This machine was wonderful, saved on time and on my hands. I did alot of baking which my hands would hurt after I got done. With this I bake many different things and my hands do not hurt.I baked alot of mini breads for X-Mas to give as gifts.I was done before I knew it. Now the only thing that I had to do was clean up, pack and deliver the goodies.I had to have one so"" I bought this before X-Mas and used it right away.I broke the gear worm in my Mother Inlaws mixer which I fixed.I took this apart myself. You can fix this on your own. Do not buy a new machine. The part is plaistic and may strip during use.I love this mixer."
4,Solid machine,"Does the job, made my wife happy at Christmas. Built like a tank. Shipped quick. Would have been five stars but it had a tiny pinpoint manufacturing blemish or chip in the paint. My wife needed it for Christmas baking so I wasn't going to send it back, as it was barely noticeable."
4,KitchenAid Mixer,"I've always wanted one, so when I saw this KitchenAid at a good price, I knew I had to get it! My husband wasn't convinced at first, but now that he's been the taste tester for a few recipes, he agrees that this was a good purchase. I was a little skeptical at first because of some of the negative reviews and comments that it was cheaply made, but overall I am satisfied. My only complaint is that the low speeds are really low; if you really need to mix something you have to turn it up a bit high and that gets a little noisy. Other than that, I love my KitchenAid!"
4,Nice mixer,I have waited years for a nice mixer. I also own a food processor by kitchenaid and have been very happy with it. I do wish the mixer's bowl was wider though but all in all a nice product.
5,KitchenAid Mixer,Who could ask for more? A mixer that does all the recipe mixing and dazzles your kitchen counter with its super color!
5,Finally,I have been wanting one of these for at least 3 years now. I finally found one that goes with the theme of my kitchen. It comes with so many options and easy clean up. uch a durable piece to add to my kitchen. It's easy to use as well. Thank you amazon for having amazing deals daily.
2,Can't handle bread dough,"This mixer was working very well for light duty items, but when it came time to mix and knead bread dough it just couldn't handle it! After about 2 minutes with the dough, there was a horrible noise, and now it sounds like there are metal marbles clanking around in the motor. I will have to return it. If you are planning to buy this model for bread dough, I would look elsewhere! I have no other experience with KitchenAid stand mixers, so I do not know if there is another model that will fit the bill."
4,Good Machine,"I had a KitchenAid professional model but wanted a tilt back head for convenience.It works well,not as strong,but good enough for the regular baking batters."
5,Kitchen Aid Artisan,This product is great. It simplifies my life in the kitchen. Now I can simply toss the ingredients in the bowl and allow the mixer to do the work while I concentrate on other preparations for my recipes. Fantastic!
5,Info about product,The color isn't as bright as the picture shows it but I do love it and so far so good. The protection around it was broke and not in one piece but nothing wrong with the kitchenaid itself.
5,Engineer,"I bought my wife one of these about 35 years ago. She uses it at least twice a week. Since then, I have purchased both my daughters and my son's girl friend one. These ladies are very proud of these machines. This is a heavy duty machine and can do just about anything. We have never had to perform any maintenance on them except for replacing the electrical cord on my wife's due to the insulation dry rotting due to age. These machines are a little pricey but will last for many many years."
5,KitchenAid Artisan,"KitchenAid by far is the best stand mixer made in USA and now I'm a proud owner of one. As most reviewers you love it or hate it; well I love mine. It is large enough to make almost everything. I got this for my husband (he is the chef) and he has not stopped baking bread, brownies, cookies and ice cream. Our next purchase is the grinders and pasta attachments. That is the greatness of this mixer, attachments can be anytime.Bu this product and love your investment."
5,Happy,I couldn't find a cheaper price for this excellent product. It came packaged and is working as it should be!
3,Kitchenaid,"Product is great. I used it to knead bread dough. However, as kneading goes on, the lever that locks the mixer head keeps getting into the unlock position, causing thunderous rattling sound and vibration."
5,excellent product,This product is a great one at an even better price. Amazon shipped it and gift wrapped it for me and was delivered promptly. imperial gray was my color choice it goes great with a dark cabinet/stainless appliance kitchen.
5,running strong 2 years,"Got the for my wife. It has worked and worked and worked for 2 years. Never had any problems with it at all, it is well built, sturdy and BIG. the build and paint qualityare top of the line and its BIG, my wife likes that it tilts, that makes it easy to use. And its BIG. I keep telling you its BIG because it is, and its HEAVY, If my wife has any problem with it its that it is BIG and HEAVY. some may find it to be to HEAVY. But boy it just works."
3,KitchenAid Artisan Series 5-Quart Mixer,The mixer works well except it is extremely noisy and it sounds as though the motor is being over taxed. It sounded that way the first time I used it. I don't use it that often. I've only used it four or five times.I also have two (2) other KitchenAid Mixers; one (1) 4-Quart & one (1) 6-Quart and they perform very well. I bought the 5-Quart mixer because the 4-Quart mixer is getting old and it sounds like the new 5-Quart mixer.
5,Like it...,"I've tried it couple times making chocolate mouse, mashed potato and bread. I was amazed how quick and easy to make a bread dough using it. Overall, it perform well just like all the others said. So far, I haven't found anything negative about the mixer. Well, it is a bit heavy, so you don't want to move it all the time. I haven't try it with any attachment yet."
5,I love it!,I have wanted this mixer for many years. I've bought one for my daughter-in-law and one as a house warming gift for a client of mine. They both love it. I finally bought one for myself and I am so pleased with it. It's absolutely beautiful and runs like a dream. Don't hesitate... It's worth every penny!
5,Excellent product ...so far,"With a little bit of research I think you will find that this is a very good Stand Mixer, which has plenty of options for continued use beyond dough and pastry making. The machine is pretty solid and *might* be too heavy for persons with weak wrists. We will probably never use a hand held mixer again, as this is so much more convenient and less messy. The colour options combined with the retro look make this a piece of kitchen art. Clean up is simple, usage very easy and kids find it fun to watch when it does its job :-)"
4,Artisan Series 5-Quart Mixer,This is a good product for household usage.Its 325 W is enough for any regular kitchen usage. If the clearence between the bowl and the mixer body was a little bit taller it would be very beneficialI was very happy with Amazon's respons with a problem we had with the mixerHandling of the issue was totally to our statisfaction. A real customer care
4,Mixer review,"Love it! Only issue is that it's still a little difficult to pour ingredients in while the beater is in the ""down"" position. Pouring chute doesn't help a whole lot (especially since it is something else to wash). Cleans up nicely. Love the fact that most everything can be washed in the dishwaser."
4,Oh the baking I'll do!,"I had wanted one of these for a long time, but just couldn't bring myself to spend the money. Finally around the holidays last year I saw that the model and color I wanted were on sale so with my Christmas bonus I treated myself to it. I was originally worried that I might not use it enough to warrant me spending so much, but I was completely wrong. I have used the mixer for so many items and not just baked goods. I am now looking forward to purchasing some attachmentsKitchenAid FPPA Mixer Attachment Pack for Stand Mixersto expand what it is capable of doing. I'm one that doesn't keep it on the counter, but I do keep it in a easily accessible cupboard with a sliding tray so that I can pull it out at a moments notice. KitchenAid is a well known reliable brand and if this is something you've been considering buying I say go for it, you will NOT be disappointed."
4,A Kitchen Helper,"As a man, I started cooking after being married two weeks, and my kitchen aid 5 qt has been with me after 20 beautiful years of married life and cooking. Is a great help to now my daughters whom love to bake. We must use this machine to 5 times per week. Besides the required toaster/coffee pot/excellent quality knives, this is one item a cook needs in his/her kitchen. Have noticed after these twenty years am starting to notice oil dripping from housing, must be time to upgrade. I also own the slicing attachements, meat grinder, have no use for a food processor with these attachments. A must have."
1,non-believer,"I have had 2 Kitchenaid mixers, the second of which was purchased about 3 years ago. Unfortunately, like the first, it broke down after only 3 years, this despite the fact that the most they were used was once a month, rarely mixing anything denser than cream cheese. The hurdles involved in getting it repaired made it more feasible for me to toss it in the dumpster and by a less expensive and hopefully more reliable product from Sunbeam!"
3,"Great for cakes, not bread","This is a wonderful product for mixing up cake batter and cookie dough. We were disappointed in its performance making bread dough. (It dances around on the counter.) We have given it to my mom, who wanted something reliable and easy to handle, and we're upgrading to the 6-quart."
1,Attachment Oxidized,"This mixer is terrible and the customer service is even worse. After using the mixer ONE time, I put the paddle attachment into the dishwasher to clean it of all grease, etc. It came out of the dishwasher completely oxidized and unusable. When I called customer support they informed me that I ""should have read the manual"". I spent $300 on a mixer that I want to throw away. I will spend my money on a different brand next time. Terrible customer service and terrible product quality. What a disappointment."
3,Don't really Know,Got it as a gift and haven't seen her sinceI hope its working well for herTime will tell
1,STAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY -RTAYLORkidchen,"I purchased this KitchenAid Artisan Series 5 Quart Mixer,Cobalt blue in April 2012 from RTaylorkidchen. My money - $243.69 was immediately taken from my Credit Card as soon as I hit the Submit button. I was informed that I would receive the KitchenAid Artisan Series 5 Quart Mixer, Cobalt Blue by May 7, 2012 - Plenty of time for our daughters birthday present for May 20 2012.Never received the item,couldn't reach the RTaylorkidchen, sent 2 emails to the company - no response. Had to file a complaint with Amazon and the Better Business Bureau for my refund which I did get within 2 weeks of filing my complaint.Amazon is great - professional, courteous and helpful !STAY AWAY FROM RTaylorkidchen!! Emily"
5,Great Tool For the Kitchen,White is a good color for this thang. :) I wish I have time to use it more often. :(
5,baking wonder,"I have become a baking queen since i got my kitchenaid, there is nothing like it. I love love love it and i am still experimenting with recipes."
4,Amzaing!!,I don't know how I managed without this kitchen appliance. It does everything it says it does and more. I love the color I selected but there are dozens of others....can't imagine not being able to find one to coordinate with any kitchen decor. The one thing I do not like is the weight. It is very difficult for me to lift the mixer out of the cabinet but too large to have it on the counter at all times. I would not suggest storing it in a cabinet above the counter....under counter storage is best. But....it is a work-horse and I do enjoy using it.
5,Lovin' my mixer!,I just got my mixer after wanting one for years. It is gorgeous and well made. It is sturdy and the bowl is a really nice size. I got the red one and it is pretty. I also got the khaki and black cover for it.The cover is very nicely made and thick. It looks nice on the countertop.
5,Love it!,"I leave it on my counter all the time, so that I can whip up desserts and breads. Used it to make really fluffy garlic mashed potatoes. Easy to use and clean. I can't believe I went 40 years without one!"
5,Nothing compares to it!,This was just a dream of mine to own one until my wife said go for it. I think this is one of the best kitchen machines built. It is so powerful for dough and easy enough for cakes and whatever. You can purchase extra attachments which make this mixer that much more convenient. I got the grinder for meat so I can have ground meat with out the fat they add in the stores and to make the best jerky. The stainless steel bowl is just the right size for a home and the mess is easy to clean.
3,Not bad for the price,"The mixer works fine. However, this particular unit came with one slight blemish. Given the price and not having to pay shipping costs and sales tax, it was still an overall good deal."
4,KitchenAid Artican KSM150 Artisan Series 5-Quart Mixer,I have found this item to be very useful and it works very well. I use it mainly to make smoothies. It blends evenly.The only negative view I have of this product is that sometimes it is very hard to disassemble the parts for cleaning.
1,"It didnt worked, but i know KA is a good brand","I always wanted my own Kitchen Aid,my mom has had one for 25 years and has worked perfectly, it works perfectly. Unfortunately, i purchased this exact one back in july, I used it once and worked perfectly i noticed stir was very slow compared to my moms, butit worked fine. Two days later i tried to use it..it didnt work!!! Obviously it is a factory defect, but when i called KAid they told me that because I am in Costa Rica they wont apply the guarantee. I know I an unlucky. what are the odds of getting probably the only bad mixer!! I know kitchen aid is good.. i sware by it..my moms mixer is like new after all this years.. but not mine, mine doesnt work, i will have to look for someone to repair it or get me a new one. :("
1,weak motor,"Second one, must be a small motor, very sluggish thicker substances like bread dough, returning and getting a viking."
2,Not What It Used To Be !,"The Kitchen Aid KSM150,'Artisan' stand mixer has been returned to Kitchen Aid because it was severely underpowered at the low speeds, struggling even on cookie dough. The replacement that arrived recently has sufficient power, but is noisier than my original Kitchen Aid mixer (30 yrs. old), the edges of the plastic knobs are 'sharp' and annoying-I'll have to sand them down- and the metal trim really looks cheap!Further, the new machine vibrates from side to side much more than my old one ever did. If this product is 'made in the USA as claimed, then I'm afraid it's going the way of the U.S automakersin terms of quality!"
2,Not good for bread,"This mixer nearly burnt itself up and shook itself apart trying to knead a 5-cup, 2-loaf all-purpose flour bread recipe. It was rattling like a old Jeep off roading, and we were smelling smoke after 5 minutes of this thing running on low-medium... It probably does OK on cakes and stuff that a hand mixer can handle, but really... this thing should be able to handle a simple white bread recipe without blowing up. Its nothing like the rock solid, 25 year-old KitchenAid mixer I used to have. So sad that quality in this country is just gone.I returned it. One star for the mixer, one star extra for Amazon's good return policy."
5,Great nachine,I remember this mixer from my Grandmother's kitchen. I was hoping the quality was still high and wasn't disapointed. This mixer does exactly what you expect and does it very well.
5,LOVE IT!,"that sums it up. i've wanted one for several years and foudn it on sale on amazon, super fast shipping and it is everything i thought it would be. I LOVE IT!"
5,I love it!,"I have wanted one of these for over ten years. So when my boyfriend asked what I wanted for Christmas I jokingly said a kitchenaid because that is what I am used to saying to everyone. I had no idea he would actually get it for me. I have always enjoyed baking, especially bread, but it always took so much time. For the first time today, it did not and it was BETTER than hand made. Not to mention the ridiculously yummy scones it made in minutes. The truth is, it will not make you a better cook, but it will make a good cooks life, a LOT easier. I used to kneed bread for 20 minutes (dedication or frustration...?) and today I only had to kneed for... well nothing, the mixer did it FOR ME! As a result the bread was more evenly kneaded and the French bread actually tastes like French bread!! So to sum up, if you want to bake a lot, or already do. Get this machine."
4,Love it!,"I only wish I'd known how much I'd love this machine years ago. Got it right before Christmas, which helped me so easily make holiday cookies. Easy breezy. LOVE THIS."
5,Fantastic Mixer,"I've wanted a kitchen aid mixer for several years now and I am really glad I shopped with amazon.com. It was the best price for a mixer that does it all. A real pleasure to use, easy to clean and great results made an enjoyable finished product of cookies and cakes for the holidays. Thank you."
4,A Must-Have in the kitchen,"After using a Sunbeam mixer for 35 years, I needed to replace my worn-out friend. I shopped and compared products and prices for a couple years. I knew about the wonderful KitchenAid mixers reputation from friends and opted for that brand. I found Amazon.com offering a new KitchenAid Artisan mixer for $242.00. Wow, such a deal! No tax, no shipping and a $30 rebate from KitchenAid! Buying from Amazon saved me $88.00, and I became one very-pleased shopper."
5,the most ballingist mixer ever,It gets the job done. I weighed 180 pounds before I got this and now am over 220 and can no longer see my feet.
4,kitchenaide,"I like this product. It has made baking so much easier, quicker and the kitchen stays cleaner. I would purchase an extra bowl for mixing with this product for convenience. you'll end up baking more than you would normally because it is so easy and quick to use."
4,Love it,I am not a chef by any means but I did find myself replacing mixers quite often and I found this one very easy to use and the color is beautiful!!
4,Splurge for the Pro if you are into bread making,"I have never had a stand mixer before and was excited about having one. This mixer is great for basic use but if you are into making dough, splurge for the Professional model. The dough hook that comes with this model is terrible. The dough is constantly riding up the hook which makes it impossible to get a good knead.I am going to try the dough hook that comes with the pro model to see if it works any better."
5,Your next purchase needs to be a TREADMILL!,"I bought this as my Christmas present to myself. I love cooking and started when I was just a kid, helping my Grandma and she always had stand mixers. I love baking and had even considered going to culinary school to become a pastry chef. This is a great product. I don't really have any complaints other than I think I should have bought a treadmill along with it, because I have gained more weight after buying it because I want to use it all the time to make these incredibly fattening dishes. It is great for a home cook like myself, maybe someone who cooks professionally might need a larger model with more power, but this is perfect for me."
5,I LOVE IT,"This is everything I thought it would be and I'm sure I haven't even used it for half of what it is capable of doing... It is easy to use, easy to clean and I love it. I look forward to this being a piece of our kitchen for many, many years to come. It is worth the price."
5,Make life easier,I love this mixer. It shaves time off baking and cooking. Worthwhile investment in any kitchen.
5,It's the best for a home user.,"I bought this mixer for my wife almost five years ago. Since then, we've used it at least once a week. It still looks new, and shows every indication of outlasting us both.It's heavy, and that's good. It's heavy duty, and that's great.Why buy a cheap mixer? Sure, this one costs a bit more, but you will almost certainly never have to replace it."
4,Happy cook,I wanted a mixer that I didn't have to hold or watch. I heard that KitchenAid was best buy from Consumers Report. And the price was the best that I found.
4,wonderfully powerful mixer,"In the short time (6 months) that I have used this mixer, I would say I like it very, very much, but it sure is heavy and so it sits atop of my counter. And, I've NEVER seen the price lower."
5,KA Artisan mixer,"I unpacked it today. I found that the accessories were designed by people who understood that they would have to be cleaned after use! The drive shaft to which the food grinder and other accessories are attached is accessible and is keyed so that you know when the unit is properly connected. The food grinder, even though partly made of plastic, is metal in the parts that transfer power. The unit is very easy to clean, assemble and to attach to the Artisan. There is ample power to perform the required task with speed and without worry that something will break. After grinding 2 lbs of lean pork and some bacon, to add a little fat and flavor, the unit was very easy to disassemble and to clean.If all my small appliances worked as well and were so easily cleaned some of them would see a lot more use."
5,I love it!,"My grandmother bought this for our 2nd wedding anniversary. I love to bake, but sometimes the handheld mixers just don't do the job. I love that I can make bread with it too. The color is very pretty and suits me nicely. It's also incredibly easy to clean up, which is a big plus in my book!"
5,Excellent Mixer,"Honestly, there is no better brand of household mixer out there in my mind. This thing is powerful, easy to clean, and lasts a lifetime."
5,Happy to be back to KitchenAid,"For a few years I took a vacation from cooking. During that time, I impulsively gave my KitchenAid mixer to my daughter, along with several extra mixing bowls and attachments. When I decided to cook again, I bought an inexpensive stand mixer, thinking I did not need to spend so much money and that it would meet my needs. I was so wrong. After an attempt to whip egg whites failed because my mixer would not go fast enough to whip the whites, I decided I was going back to KitchenAid. I watched Amazon for some good prices to come along - which happened, and now I am happily in possession of my new, very powerful KitchenAid mixer and beginning to look for all the attachments again. I am a 'kitchen wannabe' who is now a 'kitchen gonnabe'."
2,It go but Gose to fast and dose work in oz to well 35o vot but oz is only 240,It Gose to fast and dose really work to well it is 35o vot and oz is 24o so dose work to well
2,"Kitchen Aid Mixer - can't review yet, this is a christmas gift!",I will review after Christmas - bought this for my daughter so hasn't been used yet. I do however love mine!
2,Kitchen Aid KSM150PSER,"Mixer is very heavy and awkward to use. Only has one large bowl and it is stainless steel; therefore, not microwave proof. Would appreciate smaller bowl in microwave proof glass as well as a glass larger bowl."
4,Handles bread doughs just fine,"A recent review predicted that this mixer wouldn't handle bread doughs because an earlier model of KitchenAid mixer of the same wattage had problems. I am aware that some earlier models with a DIFFERENT motor and gearing system had problems with heavy doughs, and for that reason I didn't buy a KitchenAid mixer. I took a chance on this new design because I read that those problems had been solved, and I am pleased to say that I have experienced no problems at all even with large batches of bread dough. KitchenAid seems to have addressed the known problems of their earlier designs and produced this very satisfactory new model."
2,Does not live up to expectations,"I purchased this with great anticipation after reading all the praise from past reviewers. Therefore, I am very surprised to find the machine so difficult to use and clean. The plastic guard is tricky to put in place, but essential because otherwise the food will be all over the counter, instead of in the mixing bowl.I cannot get any of the beaters to actually get the lumps out of mashed potatoes. My old hand mixer does a better job.My Mom has a 30 year old Sunbeam that gets better results."
1,International buyers beware,"I'm sure this item is very good, however, I had no idea on voltages and ordered this item to be shipped to Australia which was done quickly and efficiently. This item DOES NOT work in any other country than where the voltage is 110 (not many). Amazon however have been amazing and allowing the return of the item plus paying for shipping costs. I trust that there will be a warning to advise customers of voltage requirements as online shopping has become so popular."
5,Misleading,"It was very frustrating trying to purchase online the product referenced in this Review! From the Site, it leads one to believe that the item can be purchased using promotional code ""HOHOHOHO"" for a $25 discount plus another $30 discount for applying for an Amazon.com credit card. I proceeded through the whole process of signing up for the credit card and attempting to purchase the item, only to find out that it doesn't apply because it is not an item shipped by Amazon.com. Yet all the navigational tools lead one to believe and allow one to proceed as though the discounts will apply...until final check-out -- very disappointing and discouraging, and a waste of my time! As a result, I will not purchase the product via this site and will next cancel my credit application."
2,Agree with reviewer from Rocky Hill CT,"I also own an Osterizer Kitchen Center after 25+ years of use along with experiencing the motor's irregular speed fits. And also, envious of the KitchenAid reputation decided on this product 4 years ago. I very rarely use it and am thankful for my standby Oster and a Sunbeam handmixer I may have to replace soon. The KitchenAid never fully mixes the stuff on the bottom, it is difficult to scrape the sides besides having to take the time to mix the bottom, and forget trying to whip up Dream Whip topping. The motor seems to be louder and more annoying than any other appliance I have and my husband and visitors have asked, ""Do they all sound like that?"" But, I have talked to other owners of the smaller KitchenAid Mixers who are quite happy with the results. I did purchase a grinder attachment and am very happy with the results but I could have stuck with just my Oster. ..."
3,Noisy Operation,"Thank God for Kitchenaids 'No Hassle' warrenty. Our first delivery of the Artisian was disappointing, it was horribly noisy in the first two speeds. A quick call to Kitchenaid had a replacement on our door within a week. The second one shared the same grinding gear noise. The third replacement is on it way now. Kitchenaid's customer service listened to both mixers and agreed that some thing was wrong. Will try the third one and then shop for another brand."
5,Best Price!!,"This Artisan Mixer is wonderful and Amazon had the best price of anyone in the stores and on the web!! Free, fast delivery too!!"
3,My new KitchenAid is nice,I like the kitchenAid but......the bowl could be a little bigger and wider. I have broken eggs twice and the shells have gone in the dough. Also the lock does not work on the KitchenAid so when I am beating dough the mixer jumps. Also when you open the mixer to clean the beaters the top drops. Would be nice if it locked in place when you open it. So I guess I am a little dissapointed with the mixer. Wish I would have gotten the 6 quart one.
5,Mixing is easy with Kitchen Aid,"I'm so happy with my new kitchen aid mixer. It works so very well. I can't wait to purchase the attachments that go with it. I'll only do that thru Amazon because of the quailty of ther products, their prices and service."
5,"LOVE this thing, it's life changing.",This mixer is so much better than my previous stand mixer - I love it. It's definitely worth the money!
4,Great mixer,"This is a good sturdy product, easy to use easy to clean up. Can handle what I need it to do!"
2,refurbished mixer is a dissapointment,"Mixer is good for light mixing, but clicks when kneading bread, and the lock to hold in place moves and allows the mixer to jump.The quality control on refurbished seems to be less than adequate."
2,A pricey disappointment,"I recently purchased a Kitchenaid Accolade Mixer for my well deserving mother-in-law for Christmas. After spending the large amount of money I waited patiently to receive the mixer in the mail. I was surprised to come home and find the mixer, in it's manufactured box, sitting on my front steps. I was very surprised to see that the mixer was not placed inside another box as if to ""hide"" it's contents to others.On Christmas my mother-in-law opened the gift to find several large gouges (cuts) on the body of the mixer, and several scratches and dents on the stainless steel bowl of the mixer. Needless to say, for the amount of money I spent on the mixer and shipping costs, I would like to think that the product is going to be in ""mint"" condition. Now I have to return the mixer and wait a longer period of time to get a new one. Next time I will be sure to shop in a store so that I have the opportunity to inspect any possible damages."
5,Excellent kitchen assistant,"Absolutely delighted with this mixer - is functional, space economic and well made- even when you mix heavy mixtures - this machine doesn't travel on the counter - I am very pleased that I invested the extra $ to get a machine I am sure will last a long time"
5,Great Price Great Product,I have never seen this mixer priced so low - we've used it many times since receiving it and it is a champ. What else is there to say - it's a Kitchenaid.
4,rebate information misleading,"the product is fine. i bought the product for the quality and usefulness of it, also because of the reduced price with the rebate. i find i was not the only one to do this from other reviews. when i applied for the rebate, it was not avaible. this will cause me to consider a long time before i buy again from Amazon. even though this may not have been intentional, the results were the same. bill"
5,Finally got the right machine for the job at a good price.,"I purchased[[ASIN:B00005UP2K KitchenAid KSM150PSWH Artisan Series 5-Quart Mixer, Cobalt several months ago, I bake a lot of cookies and muffins for friends and relatives. This mixer is the best purchase I've made in a very long time.It's a tremendous machine and serves the purpose quietly and with more than enough power to spare.No more bouncing motor and overheated smell as from my old units.I'm happy to report the quality of this product surpassed all of my expectations, for my money , the price and quality can't be beat. Walt Duda Poultney , Vt."
5,KitchenAid,I am very happy with my KitchenAid Artisan 5-Quartstand mixer~this is the best mixer I have everowned. I only wish I had purchased it whenI bought my first mixer. Thanks KitchenAid fora wonderful product--I just love it.Barbara
5,at last,"I waited a long time to get this mixer. it was well worth the wait. if you enjoy baking, this is the mixer for you. it arrived promptly and in perfect condition."
3,problem with stiff dough,"I gave this mixer to my cousin for Xmas. He made a batch of bread dough with it using the recipe in the book provided with the mixer. He smelled a burning wiring-type smell and had to let it cool down. The same thing happened when he made a batch of pizza dough. I encouraged him to replace it but he said since then it as been OK. Not sure why this happened, not happy about it!"
5,As Good As Ever,"We finally had to replace our old trusty Kitchen Aid which was part of our household for 40+ years -- not that it didn't work, but it was getting creaky.Much to our delight, KitchenAid KSM150PSER Artisan Series 5-Quart Mixer, Empire Red, has continued the tradition admirably with a couple of nice extras - including the snazzy Empire Red Paint Job, and, more importantly, the bigger bowl and splash guard. Time will tell, of course, but this seems an admirable successor to the finest mixer we have ever experienced."
5,A baker's delight,"My wife has used this product for many years, with nothing but praise for it. We purchased this one KitchenAid KSM150PSER Artisan Series 5-Quart Mixer, Empire Red for my daughter as a college graduation present, which strikes some people as being too impersonal a gift, or an inappropriate gift, for a graduation, but which is exactly what my daughter requested. She was delighted to receive it, and apparently has wanted one for a few years now. (Who knew?) Since that date, we have been enjoying some mighty fine baked goods ......."
4,5 star function - 4 star finish,"I bought a Green Apple Artisan mixer 3 years ago and have LOVED everything about it, so I recently bought a Blue Willow Artisan for my niece's wedding present. Purchased at a great price reduction during a rebate period before Christmas. The only reason I give this one 4 stars is because the painted finish has a couple of tiny pits and a tiny nub on the base and the blue color is a bit dull, (if I had it to do over I'd get this blue loving niece the ""Martha Stewart Blue"") - and the stainless steel band around the top was a bit loose. However, for function I give it 5 stars. Creaming butter and sugar for cakes is a breeze and the splatter shield is great. I bought an ice cream attachment separately so my husband is now making delicious sherbert from our farm berries. And, looks great on the counter when color coordinated with kitchen decor."
4,Quality of construction not as good as I expected,"Pros: Good color. Good functionality.Cons: First, when the mixer arrived the bowl was stuck. It took a lot of force to get it unstuck b/c the metal grooves were not lined up right when the manufacturer put it in the box. Also, there are small pits and bumps in one area near where the attachments connect to the mixer. They aren't that noticeable, but when you buy something new, and especially for this price, you expect it to be perfect. Other people I know who have Kitchenaide mixers do not seem to have had these problems, so perhaps the company's construction work ethic is declining.One more thing - it was easier to whisk eggs by hand with a fork than with the whisk attachment, b/c the attachment didn't fully separate/beat the yolks.Over all: I am happy that I own this mixer, and happy that I picked the ice blue color, and I do not know of a better alternative than this mixer."
4,mixer,I really like this mixer but it is too heavy. I wanted to buy one for someone else and I'm glad I didn't because she wouldn't be able to lift it. I find myself still trying to use my spatula with this one while is still running but you can't. I'm just going to have to get used to the new style of kitchen electrics.
3,BEWARE IF BUYING FOR A GIFT!,"I normally wouldn't write a review for a product based on shipment.. but I think for around $300 you would expect more from Amazon and should be aware. They shipped it by throwing the stickers right on the KitchenAid box and even stuffed the reciept in a crinkled ball in the box through the hole meant to pick it up! I had to give that as a wedding gift.. thankfully my sister doesn't care about that stuff but if it was anyone else I would of been too embarrassed. If you are looking to give it as a gift look elsewhere. I wonder what they would do if I had to return it... too bad I didn't have time to!Sorry this review isn't just for the product, but buyers should be aware!!"
5,Kitchn Aid Artisan Mixer,"The price couldn't be matched on this mixer! It was very difficult to find it in the ""orange"" color that my daughter and her husband wanted for a wedding gift....Amazon was the only place I could find it in this color at this great price. Plus, I received free shipping!!"
4,Kitchenaid stand mixer,"This mixer is very heavy and strong. I love the handle on the bowl, because it makes for easy pouring and cleanup. It will take a few uses for me to get use to it but I like the way it perform."
3,KitchenAid Artisan Series Mixer,"I am disappointed for two reasons. Number 1, my old KitchenAid had a lift-up bowl which made stirring much easier. This new mixer has a latch to release, then raise the top to remove the beaters from your batter before mixing. It is awkward. Also, even though it has a larger motor than my old mixer, it seems to take longer to mix. Since I've purchased, opened and used the mixer once, it is mine, however, I would not recommend it."
5,KITCHEN AID MIXER,The item is good and a handy equipment in the kitchen. Amazon has the right mix of kitchen equipment for every kitchen.
3,Kitchenaid Artisan Mixer,"This (NEW)KitchenAid KSM150PSWH Artisan Series 5-Quart Mixer, WhiteKitchenaid artisan mixer was given to friends for their anniversary. It was delivered directly to their home by Amazon.com. The mixer is white and was covered with black fingerprints when the recipient opened the box, they were able to remove the fingerprints. After using the mixer a few times - it has developed a squeak. I am disappointed about this - it was supposed to be a wonderful gift, but has not lived up to expectations."
5,The Best Gift EVER!,I bought this as a gift for my daughter and she LOVES it! It is one of the best gifts I have ever been able to give her. She uses it ALL the time. She's had it close to a year and now I will begin adding attachments as she is pregnant and will be making her own baby food and cooking even more.
2,What a disappointment,I have very high expectation for this product as it has very good review. but mine stopped work in about 45 days. I only used about 10 times at most for mixing doughs. Now I need to contact the support.
5,KitchenAid Artisan Series 5-Quart Mixer,Totally love my mixer. Strong motor. Kneads breads well! Would highly recommend this product. BTW shipping was fast. Got it in about 4 days after ordering.
4,great design,"I love the classic look of this product with the bright red color. It really is a nice piece in the kitchen, and very easy to use as well. One thing I think they could improve on is noise reduction while mixing. It's not extremely loud, but compared to some other brands it is noisy."
5,Love it!,This is my second one. First one lasted 30 years of heavy use but finally bit the dust. These are such work horses!
