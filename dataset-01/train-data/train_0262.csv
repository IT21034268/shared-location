2,"They don't sing, they yell!!","I trhink this cd was not such a great one [like all the other ones] the only song I kinda like is In The End, but that's pretty much oit! as I said earlier, they don't sing, they yell!!"
3,Simple,"Linkin Park used to be my favorite band until I started listening to SOAD more extensivley. I never really noticed how plain and simple LP's lyrics are. Basically: ""I'm paranoid!"" ""No one listens to me!"" ""I'm depressed!"". The lyrics are all about themselves. It's a simple CD with some good tunes, but the lyrics are very plain."
5,one of the best ever..,"Ok, so maybe that was an over-view.. but this CD is one of the best out there. It's one of the few that you can put into your CD player and let it go beginning to end and enjoy every minute. And unlike most other bands, the lyrics have meanings, it's incredible! If you don't already own this, i highly suggest it!"
2,Whatever.,"Shit, why the hell is everyone giving Linkin Park such bad reviews? Mike Shinoda is an excellent rapper. I mean, for god sake, at least he dosen't swear every 30 seconds, like some rappers out there nowadays do. anyways, I reccomend this cd to anyone, especially when you've had a really awful day, and just need something good to listen to."
5,Hybird Theory is a MASTERPIECE,I LOVE Hybird Theory. This alblum is very similar to Meteora and is just as good. Everyone in the band exept the DJ is amazing. I have listened to this alblum over and over again. I have never gotten tired of it. You rule Linkin Park.
5,buy it! now!,"linkin park is one of the best bands i have ever heard. i've seen them in concert with the kottonmouth kings, rehab, and corporate avenger and they were definently the most awesome band there. i agree with other reveiwers that their lyrics are sort of confusing and sometimes seen to not mean anything, but there sound is great. personally, i could care less about the meaning of the lyrics. Another great thing about linkin park is that they dont swear at all so i dont get any greif from my parents. theyre comparable to bands like korn and limp bizkit, if you like those bands, get hybrid theory, you wont regret it."
4,Linkin Park Hybrid Theory,"This is one of the best cds I own. Every song on this cd is awesome except for Cure for the Itch, which is a cheesy dj sample. If you have ever heard the song One Step Closer and you liked it, you should buy this cd. When I got this cd I had only heard the song One Step Closer, and I figured that would be the only good song on this cd. I was dead wrong. Linkin Park seem to have combined the style of Limp Bizkit and Korn beautifully, and if you don't like either of those two band don't be so quick to judge this cd. It is great, and anyone who likes any kind of popular music will like this cd. You can find traces of rap, rock, even the crappy boy band sound (and if you don't go for boy bands, which I don't, don't worry there isn't a whole lot of that crap on this cd). I would recommend this cd to anyone except my grandparents. The only cd that would get a higher rating from me would be Smash by The Offspring."
3,Somewhat good,"I hate to admit it, but this was my first modern cd that I ever had. My parents were very old-style and didn't let me listen to any ""modern crap"" for like 13 years so in the beginning this was something really new and really cool. Besides I didn't hear anything else modern besides this before, so I didn't have anything to compare to.Now that I do I don't like Linkin Park anymore. It's newer albums are sort of cool, but this one, with an exception of a few songs is not so good. But that's just my personal taste. They do have some nice songs like In the End, Crawling, etc. Good start. I think they'll get much better in some time. They got talent."
3,Not That Good....,"The CD is ok but not one of the best. The only songs that really grabbed my attention were Papercut, Runaway, and A Place for My Head. The rest of the songs were okay but not 4 or 5 star qualtiy. I guess if you liked Crawling and In the End you would enjoy SOME of the songs. I was very disappointed by this CD. To me it was a waste of my 15 bucks."
5,*grin*,"every time i listen to this cd i swear they wrote it for me... i listen to it so personally and besides the awesome lyrics the rythyms, melodies, the music in general is so eclectic and new and absolutely awesome... every single person should own this cd"
3,Too Much of the Same,"I'm not a fan of the whole rap/rock ""Nu-Metal"" genre, and on principle I had to give this 3/5 stars. I can't wait until this genre goes away.However, as much as I really wanted to write this CD off, a few of the melodies completely took me by surprise. You'd have to be tone deaf to not appreciate that about ""In the End"". Another reviewer said ""I don't like it because it's too soft"". Sure, but... did you not hear that melody?!"
5,"I gave it away in effort to share to wealth, but should have",kept it!It's fabulous! This guy's voice is from heaven. The music makes sense for every mood. Get it!
4,Not bad at all for a rap/rock band,"I am typically a punk/ska fan and when I heard Linkin Park's first single ""One Step Closer"", I didn't think much of it. When I heard the song more, I began appreciating it more. Yea, I know it may sound weird but my fav songs of this album are all the singles: ""Crawling"" ""One Step Closer"" ""In The End'"" and ""Papercut"" is their best song out of those singles. In this review, I just proved to you that you don't have to be a Papa Roach, Limp Bizkit, or Korn fan to like LP."
4,Good stuff but...,"I borrowed this CD from a friend and basically, it's really good. The awesome vocals of the singer and the rapper, combined with great guitars, drums, and DJing, makes this a very tempting cd to buy. BUT, while the songs song great at first, after a couple days they seem to blend into eachother. linkin park perfected this art form, and while the sound is great at first, it quickly becomes boring. with the exception of 'in the end,' the best song on the cd, this cd will just collect dust on your shelf after a week"
5,baddest cd goin',This is the baddest cd out! Every song (with the exception of #11)should be a #1 hit. The only negative thing I can say about the album is they should have saved some of their songs for the follow-up album. There's NO WAY they (or any band for that matter) can even come close to matching Hyrid Theory.
2,A cross between nsync and a lousey hardcoreband,"First let me say I don't own this album but my friend does and she plays it constantley.I don't know the titles and the band members' names but I do know I hate this album.It's another rap,metal,industrial,pop blend that misses the mark.I think they're going for a ""sick and twisted""sound but instead they got winey and sugarcoated.The rapping on this album is lame and sounds similar to the cringe-worthy stylings of 311.They spent way too much time on production and style and not enough time on honesty and good song writing.Don't get me wrong these guys have talent but musical ability can't carry an album alone.Basically it sounds like a cross between nsync and a bad hardcore band which is fine for a joke but these guys are serious."
5,Best I've Heard Since 'Smash',"For starters, I'm an old guy. I've never heard of Linkin Park prior to a few weeks ago, I don't watch MTV or listen to much new music. For reference, my favorite band is X, favorite single performer is Jimi Hendrix.A coworker of mine was playing 'Hybrid Theory', I heard it, liked it, bought it, and now I believe it's the best album I've heard since The Offspring's 'Smash'. VERY impressed with the intelligence of the lyrics and diversity of musical styles."
1,Manufactured Commercial Boy Band,"As Pop is dying, it looks like the world need a band to replace the Backstreet Boys.Rap/Metal, the new thing. The stuff the kids like...so let's make a rap/metal album. It's a simple verse chorus verse, a part in order to make the song less boring, verse, verse, verse. It's not like these guys would have done much for their success, it's music made for the kids out there who are unable to listen to anything that's even a little more comlicated.MTV's new favorites, Linkin Park.Yes, no swear word, ain't that great? Now the moms are satisfied too!Linkin' park provides music for people who music don't have lots of time to focus on it. It's mainstream music for the masses. So highly recommended for people who prefer house and pop music."
1,"Yeah Man, Soo Hardcore!!!","This album is absolutely one of the most ridiculous musical efforts I have ever listened to. This is nothing more than a product manufactured for angry children who don't want to listen to music that is actually challenging. The subject matter is trite, all the scratching is silly, the entire thing is overproduced, it sound like it was sung by a robot. There is not a single shred of rawness on this entire album. It's a joke. Even posers know this is stupid."
3,*This is really uninspired*,"Mm...I really couldnt even have an opinion on this album. I just wanna make a few things clear. This doesn't sound like Bizkit at all... whoever says they do is on crack. this isnt really that nu-metal. more in a genre of its own. this is like techno-metal with a dash of rap... I personally think the techno metal sounding thing is very cool. its smooth... I cant really describe it. I like their sound. I just think the lyrics are trite and ""teenagerish"" or whatever. I mean its decent. but its not something to rant and rave about."
5,Linkin Park debuts with a bang,"Dude, Linkin Park just totally blew me away with this album. I though that they would just be loud and obnoxious at first, but when I heard them sing ""In The End"" for the first time, I was amazed. The lead singers have awesome voices! They can rock hard and then come to such a mellow kind of song like In the End and rock in a different way. Three words, Off The Hook!"
5,Wow!,"Excellent record! I love when I buy a CD and actually like every song on it. After I heard ""In the End"" I went and bought Hybrid Theory. I started on track 1 and loved the entire CD. ""One Step Closer"" is great, as well as ""Crawling."" ""Cure for the Itch"" is a great diversion from the rock/rap songs that make up the rest of the CD (it's a DJ mix done by one of the guys in the band). My favorite song on the CD is ""Pushing Me AWay."" The lyrics are really moving.My only qualm with the CD is the fact that it's so short. I think the entire run time of the CD is something like 40 minutes. Maybe it just seems short to me because I can't get enough of it. ;)I listen to this CD all the time in my car and can't wait to see Linkin Park live. I'd definitely recommend it to anyone who is a Limp Bizkit fan and/or in to the rock/rap genre of music."
5,"Without a doubt, one of the best albums of the year","There is not one word that can describe now good this album and Linkin Park are. If you like One Step Closer and Crawling, then you will LOVE the rest of the album. Filled with Chester Benningtons powerful melodic voice and Mike Shinodas clever rapping skills, this is one album which you MUST buy. Comparing it to the likes if Limp Bizkit is an insult, can you ever imagine Fred Durst writing an album which DOESNT contain swear words??i think not. Linkin Park have been able to show different emotions without swearing very successfully. Songs such as Papercut and By Myself make you want to mosh like crazy where as With You and In The End, are calmer but just as good, if not better. HYBRID THEORY is one of my favourite albums in my CD collection, it should be in yours too."
4,"Great CD, but needs to be longer.","I believe this CD is excellent because the songs are a great mix of rap, rock, and even techno. Linkin Park shows in this CD that they can make great songs using beats from the rock genre and lyrics from the rap genre. Also, ""Hybrid Theory"" offers more than just bland, repetative songs in which someone would lose interest. The songs in ""Hybrid Theory"" have an effect on the listener by making him/her let a lot of closed in emotions out. If you enjoy rap/rock bands such as Limp Bizkit, then this CD is for you.There's no doubt that this CD has a lot to offer, but I feel that only 40 minutes for any CD wouldn't be long enough to be perfect. But Other than that, this CD is great."
2,gets old,This Album was pretty good when it came out but then just got overplayed. please don't get this unless you reallylike this kind of music. I don't.
5,What the $%@# were you thinking?,"The last two people who wrote a review for this album apparently have no taste for good music. Linkin Park is easily one of the best bands out there! They have totally original, memorable songs that you can listen to over and over again and with a mixture of rap and rock how can you go wrong? This album is one of the best albums of all time and I would highly recommend it to anyone and everyone. This album is not a kids album, and unlike rage against the machine you can actually understand what they are saying. Buy this album...now!!"
3,"Talented Kids, Uninspired Album","Evereyone's raving about Hybrid Theory. I'ts a good album, don't get me wrong, but the only reason it hasn't turned me into Linkin Park fan is the fact that the band has so much potential for so much more. When the boys revealed their musical influences on MTV i marveled. Faith No More! Tool! ""These kids are going to make some noise"" i said to myself. I bought the album, and instead of hearing inspired noise, i got uninspired, almost boyband-ish noise. but thats enough, now onto the good stuff. The songs lyrics, which have a ranting-yet-catchy theme, are poetic, very thought provoking in nature. Songs like In the End and Crawling make you want to listen to them again and again and think deeply about the meanings. This album is a good change from the other angst driven bands out there like Sum-41 or Hoobstank. It may not be ground breaking, but i want to keep it in my collection nevertheless. Here's hoping for better things in their new album, Reanimation."
4,FINALLY! A Good Mainstream Rap-Rock CD..,"I am usually not a fan of the nu-metal/rap-rock movement at all, but this is a good CD. This is much more than Limp Bizkit garbage, these guys actually have lyrics that are...somewhat meaningful. The idea of having two vocalists sets this band away from the crowd, both vocalists are good, and they both have different strengths and weaknesses, which makes this album rare in the fact it has good rap AND good screaming in it. One thing about rap rock that is dissapionting is some vocalists can be great singers, but their rapping voice is horrible, which can greatly degrade an otherwise decent album. All of the songs on this CD are at least decent, except I really dislike track 10. Besides that, this is a great CD and it can be enjoyed by alot of people."
1,Musical Ignorance,"Just another attempt by a band to embrace anger and pain, and yet again the result is irrelevent whining. Angst has become something of a money-making machine these days. Those bands who do have lyrical content that implies they have read a book or two get buried. From beginning to end this cd may actually cause one two bury there head into the ground and suffocate. Presently I am looking into cryogenics to wait for a few bands to come out with something to say. Eight years ago youth were yelling against injustice, and plight. Now they seem to be yelling because there car only has aluminum alloy wheels instead of Chrome. Im not one to waist my time reviewing new bands that are so incredibly bad. But Linkin Park just had fallen further into the hole caused by musical audacities."
2,"No Bass, no feeling","Very Average like most of these metal/rap crossover bands and where the hell is the bass?? These guys sound very similar to Limp Bizkit and the Deftones, although the deftones are much better. If you want to listen to talented musicians and music to get you fired up listen to bands like Tool, Slipknot and Rage."
2,Dear god... what happend.,"Linkin Park's debut album, ""Hybrid Theory"" has its up's and down's. First off, I'd like to say that they do have good voices. But, what are their songs about? Absolutely nothing. Lets think about deep lyrics such as ""Everything you say to me/takes me one step closer to the edge/I'm about to break."" these aren't ""feelings"" They're just ... words. They're very un-original songs, I have to say. But, we have all the other unoriginal artists such as, nsync, briteny spears, metallica, etc etc. Yes, they do have good voices and they're getting big on money but what about lyrics? If you want a CD with impacting lyrics and meaningful songs, I suggest you continue to search elsewhere and not waste your time here...."
1,Cheap Imitations!,"When I heard the song ""One Step Closer"" I immediately thought of how pathetic this band really was. They are trying to copy the sound of Limp Bizkit and doing it very poorly. The lead singer tries to pull off the high-pitched screaming/rapping that is signature Fred Durst, and fails miserably. Limp gets in verses around the middles of their sings that have some sort of screaming (""Get the f*** up! DJ Lethal, bring it on!) in the middle with heavy metal in the background and the sounds of DJ Lethal. Linkin Park attempt to do the same with ""Shut up when I'm talkin to you"". This could be the most pathetic rock rap attempt I have heard since Vanilla Ice's ""Hard To Swallow"" in '98."
2,This is PANSY metal!,"God, if metal is dying it's because of bands like this. The sound is nothing ground breaking and rather repetitive IMNSHO. This group sounds like a bunch of pansies trying to be hardcore. Radio friendly fodder for the sh33p."
1,This whole rap-metal thing is really stupid,"While they're better than Slipknot, Limp Bizkit and Korn, they're not really all that good. Their songs are pretty dull (Zero creativity was put into the making of these records) and are overplayed. Just more stupidity from rap-metal band #9,120,462,214.5531."
2,lol!,"this is a hilarious attempt of being a good band! bad bad album! there songs are so emo that its not even funny. If you are an insecure teen who's trying to find a music type that fits there musical taste and there social life, get this album! listen to the lyrics and you'll realize that this band sucks! lol! lol! this band is the worst band in the history of rock. ALl you real music lovers get some iron maiden or judas priest albums. seriously. ""A place for my head! you try to take the best of me, go away"" wtf? forget this. i'm gonna go somewhere else and actually get an album where the band actually has decent lyrics and music. The only reason i gave this a 2 was because the album cover is decent and the DJ has a bit of talent. Listen to the guitarist! Where is the blistering solo? or the complex bass lines? Might as well added a person saying the sounds instead of these fake guitarist/bassists. forget this. peace out"
1,well i was out a toilet paper,had nothing else! they deserved one star for the hard to reach places.....listen to pantera
2,not very good...,"well where to start. this is not a good release. the rapping sounds too much like fred durst. the music is not as primitive as the one limp bizkit does, still it has no great complexity or talent. the lyrics are meaningless, and the vocals aren't really good. overall a bad debut, from a faceless nu metal band. if you like this i'd recommend limp bizkit, newer korn and primer 55"
1,The bastard child of Fred Durst and Christina Aguilera,"I remember the first time I heard ""One Step Closer"" and mistook it for a new ""Limp Bizkit"" single. Then someone said to me, ""No, this is 'Linkin Park', they're a lot better than 'Limp Bizkit'."" Well, actually, they sound exactly alike, and I can't stand either of them. This album was made for one reason: to sell. Most bands make music as an art...not these MTV whores. Do yourself a favor and stray away when you see this in your record store parked right next to ""Limp Bizkit."""
3,Great music that got old,"I bought this album when ""One step closer"" was the hit on the album.I loved the album and it was great.But as they started gaining popularity,their songs started coming on radio.And they were played over and over and over..........which is why they released the album ""Reanimation"".That was a good album,because they took the hits off of this album and remixed them.But after more radio play I got disgusted with this album and ""Reanimation"".To sum it all up,this is a good album,but after listening to the CD twice,you`ll get sick of the so-called music(annoying DJ noises) and wish for your money back,so its better to download or get this album burned.And if there new album has similar sound to this album,I guarantee that nobody will know who Linkin Park is after this year."
5,5/5,This album is 5 stars because all of the songs are listenable. I really enjoy listening to this album.I highly recommend this album. Addy.
5,good atleast,"amazing cd and and i am not a big fan of mainstream nu-metal scene . this cd is nt band for their debut but short .The first track is good .especially Points Of Authority , amazing tack kinda sounds like Nine Inch Nails Front man Trent Reznor and i am a big fan on NIN .the rest do fine and i would prefer this one than Metora ."
3,The Latest Power Pop,"The only reason I've heard any Linkin Park songs is because my 14 year old son listens to it. Mostly, I'm just relieved it doesn't contain nasty lyrics. Many of the negative ""reviews"" here remind me of what people said about Boston, Foreigner, and REO Speedwagon in the 1970's, that they were just ""power pop"" and not true rock and roll like the Stones and Led Zeppelin. Some truth to that, but so what? I listened to Led Zep and REO Speedwagon. The formula-driven songs and slick production of Linkin Park (which are clearly evident amid all the screaming) suggest to me they are just a newer form of power pop with some rap thrown in the mix. In a year or so I expect my son will have moved on to something else and won't want to admit he ever liked Linkin Park. Me, I'll just stick to my Def Leppard."
3,More like younger Limp Bizkit,I heard about this band and thought like everybody else that they were gonna sound different. I was wrong. They sound like a young Limp Bizkit. And they are no differnt from Limp's newest album. But three stars are for having a nice sound.
4,"Original, inventive, and interesting CD","That sums it up pretty well. My fav song is 2, 3 is also really good. As far as what bands Linkin sounds like- I would say a cross between Limp Bizket and Incubus, little deftones thrown in as well. For the money you wont go wrong with this CD."
4,"wow, 4 1/2 stars","This cd is awsome. The lyrics are good the music is special and it combines to make some of the best nu-metal around. the reason why i gave it 4 1/2 instead of 5 is because they are overplayed way too much.There other cd Reanimation is ok but not the best. But you should listen to Aaron Lewis and Chester in Krwlng its awsome.There is another cd that only made a 1,000 cdzs and is very rare its called Hybrid Thoery Ep.Overall this is an excellent cd.Was this review helpful to you?"
5,Linkin Park Rocks!!!,"This is the first CD that i bought, that i could actually listen to over and over again. Every song was awesome. With good guitar rythyms, neat DJ beats, an awesome drum line, cool rap parts, and an explosive rock voice. These six guys (Brad Delson, Chester Bennington, Mike Shinoda, Joe Hahn, Pheonix, and Rob Bourdin) have an awesome thing going. Linkin Park takes the Rap/Rock to a new level. Its pretty cool of what they did. Get this CD, it is the BEST!!!!"
3,Very interesting,"This isn't really the type of music I'd usually listen to.But there was something mysteriously haunting about a few of the tracks on this compilation,such as the heavily powerful Papercut and Crawling.These guys truly sound like a band on the edge,each member sounding as if they're trying to restrain themselves from killing someone.Contary to other comments which suggest they're a cheap rip-off of them,Linkin Park are far superior to the off putting and ,truth be told,deeply irritating Limp Bizkit (what they trying to prove spelling it wrong anyway?)Even to people who would usually never approach this kind of thing with a bargepole,I would recommend it,it's perfect to listen to one a rainy Friday afternoon at the end of the week."
3,A decent debut,"I think Linkin Park is both under-rated and over-rated.This Cd is not awful, but it's not five star material.The guitars are somewhat repetative,the bass is lacking, and the Dj is really not needed.The occasional good Dj is fine with me, but this particular one isn't par for the course.And why two singers?The great Chino Moreno has more range than both of hese guys.But anyway, this cd is pretty good. A pro of this album is the fact that there is no cursing.Cursing doesn't offend me,but many bands take to the extreme,which is VERY boring.These guys may be a great band one day,but now they're just average."
3,ANOTHER ONE HIT WONDER?,"This album is basically ""In The End,"" one of the best songs of any genre in the last ten years. ""In the End's"" lyrics are authoritative and the music hits all the major pressure points. ""In the End"" is one of those rare anomalies, a pop hit that deserves to be. Unfortunately, there's nothing else remotely like it on the rest of the album. ""Papercut"" is decent, but frankly all the other tracks are a serious letdown. They're too teeny bopper to be convincing, with an annoying tendency to give way to heartless screams reminiscent of so many other hard rock bands. Hopefully Linkin Park will mature over time and manage to translate the musical poetry of ""In the End"" to other songs in the future. But if you've heard ""In the End"" on the radio, the only reason I don't give this album ONE star, and are hoping for more of the same, don't even bother."
1,I can't believe I used to like this crap,"Way back on the 200th page I said this band was the best.Well I was 11 and I was misguided but I can't believe I liked this band! Both of the singers have absolutely no talent, they are not good at guitar at all, there is no bass, and that rapping crap is terrible.Trust me, those jr. highers that listen to this music and think it's cool have a very bad taste in music."
2,"Hybrid Theory, not as I thought","I bought this CD two weeks ago, instead of getting Unpluged in NY by Nirvana, thinking that it would be good. All my friends at school had said that it would be good, and I like One Step Closer, but this CD just doesn't live up to its expectations. Don't get me wrong, I like rap and rock and rap/rock, but all the songs on this CD have too much scratching and no bass!! I don't see how there could ever be a band without a bass in it. I've been waiting for this CD to grow on me, like all good CD's do, but it just hasn't. Now when I ask my friends if its good, they all say ""its ok, but it gets old after a few listens."" And I agree whole heartedly with them. Its ok, but it gets old after a little while. I wouldn't recomend this to anyone, unless you really like scratching and don't like bass too much. I should have gotten unplugged in NY, like I was going to, and I never should have gotten this not so good CD."
1,I wonder if they would be around if Korn or Deftones never existed....,"The answer is NO!!!! These guys dont' know jack-s**t about music!!! I am not a tough reviewer, but this has to stop. They are a watered down(way watered down), less talented, whiny imitation Korn. This music is targeted solely for 11, 12, or 13 year olds whose parents won't let them get music with parental advisory stickers on them. Heck, most of the people who listen to Linkin Park aren't even old enough to feel teen angst, because I go to high school, and no one there listens to them or they would be made fun of. Kids, dont buy this [...]!!! Its not cool, better listen to nothing than listen to them."
2,yet another teen-leech band,"I'm giving 2 stars instead of one because these guys are slightly more talented artists, musically, than Limp Bizkit. But it's the same musical hollowness, not much talent. Their purpose seems to be not to make music, as much as to make money off of teenagers with disposable income. And the bands aren't totally to blame; it's also the greedy record execs or whoever $ign$ them to the label, knowing full well they stand to make TONS of money. If you like these teen-leech bands I'd venture to guess you are very young (0-16 yrs) and are ignorant musically. I was once the same way. Bands like this leech off of this ignorance."
2,I can't beleive there are so many good reviews,"This album is garbage. Linkin Park is horrible live, they have no talent. There voice is overedited in the studio. They have catchy songs, songs that get old after the 5th listen. This is NOT real music.I'd also like to state the customers that liked this item also enjoyed:* Staind* Evanescence* Hoobastank* Korn* TraptIs that enough proof? Go listen to Tool or Deftones."
1,"POLL, ONLY IF YOU HAVE THIS ALBUM",iF YOU REGRET BUYING THIS ALBUM AND THROWING YOUR PRECIOUS MONEY AWAY THAT COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER SPENT PRESS YES. IF YOU FIND THIS ALBUM A GREAT INVESTMENT AND SOMEDAY THIS WILL BE A CLASSICAL ALBUM THAT WILL GO TO BE AN ALLTIME GREAT PRESS NO.
1,"THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YOU, AND ""REAL"" PEOPLE","The following are ""artists"" that make music for the kids who want to act f**ked up &/or depressed, because its ""cool"" to feel that way even if you dont REALLY feel that way, the following bands and their record labels know this is marketable.Linkin Park; My Chemical Romance; Papa Roach; Korn; Limp Bizkit; Good Charlotte, Avril Lavigne; Sum41_____________________________________________________The following artists make/made music for the kids who actually were f**ked up, and didn't act that way to fit inPearl Jam; Radiohead; the Cure; Alice in Chains; Nine Inch Nails; Joy Division; Stabbing Westward; Soundgarden______________________________________________________The point? You're on the phony side - Why? Because you and every other Linkin Park fan are not only brainwashed, you're fake. You can remain on the side you're on... I'm just presenting the fact that you're a joke for doing it, and all of us on the other side know it."
1,piece of sh*t,"I bought this album when it was first released because I heard it was good. After listening to it once, I burned it(with flames not a CD burner). This album is a disgrace to music. The lyrics are stupid and the instruments suck. Linkin Park's new stuff sucks as well. Don't waste your money."
4,Best damn Cd just gets better,I didn't think Hybrid Theory could get any better than it already was. Boy was I wrong. This is one of the best Cds I've ever heard. I give it 5 stars.
1,not unlike styx,"Remember those ""wonderful"" ballads from the mid eighties? by kiss, heart and styx? like tame, placid rock smothered in layer upon layer of stinking, cheesy synth, like twinkies deep-fried in animal fats? like a once pretty girl who turned fat, then resorted to drowning herself in layer upon layer of sickening, clotted makeup? Then you'll be glad to know lin""coln"" park have ushered a renaissance in stinking, slow, monolithic, ugly, emotionally cliched, tired, trite stodgy ballads. and they don't even have a fretless bass, or female singer. shame on them."
2,Not as bas as Limp Bizkit.,"Still, it's mostly a bunch of yelling and heavy guitars that never manage to come together into a truly compelling song."
1,TERRIBLE!!!!!,"IF YOU CONSIDER YOURSELF A REAL ROCK FAN, OR IF YOU LIKE REAL MUSIC, STAY AWAY OF THIS GARBAGE!!!! JESUS, IT'S SO BAD, MY EARS ARE BLEEDING!! THIS GIVES A NEW MEANING FOR THE EXPRESSION ""THE WORST BAND IN THE WORLD""!!! A DISGRACE, FROM THE BEGINNING 'TILL THE END!!! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS TRASH!!! INSTEAD, GET A REAL ROCK BAND ALBUM. AND DON'T LISTEN THE REVIEWERS THAT SAYS THIS IS INNOVATIVE OR GOOD. THEY ARE FREAKING DISTURBED TEENS WITH MENTAL PROBLEMS, OR PEOPLE WHO DON'T LIKE REAL MUSIC!! THE SYSTEM HAVE TO LET ME GIVE A LOWER NOTE, BECAUSE THIS DESERVES INFINITE NEGATIVE STARS!!!AND DON'T TELL ME I HAVEN'T WARN YOU!!!"
2,A cross between nsync and a lousey hardcoreband,"I didn't like this album.It's a rap,metal,industrial,pop combo that just doesn't work.It seems contrived and sugar-coated.The rapping on this album is lame and sounds similar to 311.They spent way too much time on production and style and not enough time on honesty and good song writing.Don't get me wrong these guys can play but musical ability can't carry an album alone.Basically it's a cross between nsync and a ... hardcore band."
1,"I've never said this about a band before, but...","... This is by far, the best example of a MTV band. NOTHING sounds original with this ""band""!1. Throw in distorted guitars. Not TOO heavy. Wouldn't want it too heavy or it'll hurt everyone's ears!2. Add in a rapper(make sure he's white), and a DJ(who has no idea what he's doing)3. Get a singer who has a lot of ""angst"", and have him write songs about his horrible childhood. (""I never got a pony for Christmas! Now I hate everything! Oh! And I'd like to thank my mom and dad and..."")4. BONUS! The singer sounds like a member of N'Sync!But of course, this band will probably win a Grammy sometime or another. It did sell a lot of records you know. After all, that's all the Grammy awards pay attention to. Who can sell the most. This band'll disappear. While that does not mean a band loses talent or anything like that... in this case, however, it'll be a blessing."
5,a must have CD,"I actually bougt this cd ot of curiosity, cause i havn't heard anything about this group before, from the moment i first heard the CD i was blown away, to this date in the best CD in my collection. Is one of those CDs that you can play and not hit the skip botton. This ladys and gents is a true clasic in it's oun time."
4,good rap/rock combination- 4 stars,"good cd, better than meteoratop 5 in no order1.papercut2.one step closer3.points of authority4.crawling5.in the end"
4,exciting,"An exciting debut from a promising young band. linkin park maybe late for the party but their sample-heavy and melodic brand of rap metal serves as a totally refreshing alternative to the sickening (c)rap metal played by limp bizkit. i'd say cut down on the excess balladry (crawling,in the end) and focus more on whole grains like papercut & points of authority. there's a prevailing notion that rap metal will die out soon, following the paths of grunge and hair metal but with bands like these, i think we ought to let it stay for a little while."
3,hummmmmm........,"There's no possible way that I could give this cd five stars. There are very few good songs on this cd and the few that are good all sound the same. I bought this and Fuel, Something Like Human, the same day. I was sure that I would end up listening to Linkin Park more, but to my suprise Fuel, was a helluva lot better."
1,Corporate manufactured BS.,This band licks ballz. They basically make pop music in order to make money. period. Tool kicks their ass in every way imaginable.
3,"Good, but overrated","The CD Hybrid Theory by LP, their debut, isn't as original as people claim of it to be. They have music that's too easy to catch audiences, and are kind of like boy band metal. There are good and bad songs on this CD.The high points are the memorable ""Points of Authority"", mainly because I like the guitar riffs in the post-chorus. ""In the End"" was good, but now it's overplayed. However, ""Papercut"", the album's first song is pretty enjoyable. Some songs tend to sound alike, and they use techno in the same sense of affects as KoRn did on Issues. However, everyone acts as if it's how nu-metal should be. It already existed before Limp Bizkit, whether you like it or not."
3,z good enough 2 catch my attention,"Well this think is ok, actually its good.The heavy rock ones r good. I shud hav given it 2 stars but I was High!!Just Kidding."
4,Awesome,"Every single song is off the charts. But sadly it was just too good to be true, their next album killed their music. It was very sad"
4,Pretty good.,"I think this is a pretty good cd.Bad things are the rapper and the lyrics.Good things are the melodies in the songs, and the singer. He has a good voice.Overall they are not as good as Deftones and Tool, but they are worth checking out. If you like the rock aspects of this album and want better lyrics get Deftones and Tool"
4,Cure for the Itch ruins it,"Hybrid Theory is a great CD...if you like Limp Bizkit, you'll love this. The entire CD is full of great guitars and is packed with tons of energy. It's great for listening to before going out and playing football or any contact sport. The only thing that keeps this album from earning 5 stars is Cure for the Itch. It completely stops the momentum throughout the entire CD. It's loud and fast and then you hit this song and go, ""What was that?"" Luckily it's the 2nd last track. Overall this is a great rock CD... Get it. You won't be disappointed."
2,Angry Boy Band,"Its astonishing to witness how many overtly anti-boyband teens can be vacuumed into the genre by sneaky music producers. Of course these boy bands are given coarse voices, bleached hair, and angry lyrics, but the idea is the same. Linkin Park is the packaged product of producers who are trying to be like Limp Bizkit(A heinous crime in itself, superseded only the crime of allowing such an untalented and asinine singer as Durst to make it big). Not convinced, ""take in the end"" and get it to the part where they have the ""put my trust"" solo. Then have a girl listen to just that cut and listen to her response. I bet she says, ""is this the new one from the backstreetboys?"""
5,unreal!!!,One of my freinds went around school writing Linkin Park on all the chalk boards so I decided to go on the internet and check it out. I found the single and was hooked instantly. I got the CD and can't stop listening to it. I love Chester's voice and how he and Mike blend vocals. It's worth the money!
3,rap rock hybrid at its best,"from the opening song ""papercut"" linkin park show what it rakes to suceed in the raprock genre. with the stabbing westwardy vocals of the lead singer to the smartass rymes of the mcee linkin park show that you dont have to have fred durst whining to make a good album.hybrid theory is an all out blitz of emotions from the minds of a couple of screwed up individuals. the way the songs go together make it so its kinda of a concept album. ""one step closer"" is probably the wirst song on the album. that says alot being that song is their hit. overall this album is pretty good.what it lacks is originality. they are doing stuff like a pissed off 311 would do them. if you want an album that will stay in your cd player this would be the album to buy. if you are looking for something thats going to blow your mind with orginality, then you probably wont like this album.with a little bit of motivation linkin park could easily lead the rap rock scene."
3,Another stupid boy band,"the cd was alright even though alot of the songs sound the same, the worse live i met them at a birch hill concert, they way they started out was by auditioning and then who ever made it stayed and got famous, like makin the band"
5,Tightest band of 2000,"Great mix of sound rythm and lyrics, these guys are going to be on the map soon... watch for them. Rarely does a CD come along that you like... no... LOVE every song on it, here it is. If you like 311/Korn/LimpBizkit/etc... this is a nice sound mixture of all of them, but a copy of none. buy it, you'll thank me."
5,Slammin,"Whenever I'm with my friend in his car, he listens to Linkin Park and I finally asked him what cd it was. He told me and when I got home I downloaded every song on Napster and the next day I went out and bought the cd. I love it--It's great!! It's def worth it!"
3,"Worth A Listen, but Don't Expect Much","Linkin Park are not a particularly creative or powerful band musically, but don't pass them up entirely. Having once been a massive fan, I can safely say their music gets old pretty fast. Still, Hybrid Theory is worth checking out. A few of the songs on it (most notably ""Pushing Me Away"" and ""In the End"") play with rhythm- and vocal-driven music while still keeping a rock-like feel. Basically, buy this album if you don't have strong musical tastes and want something that will satisfy your need for something at least slightly different from what you're used to. Also, it's a safe gift for someone you don't know very well."
4,HYBRID THEORY!!!..... how'd they get that name???,"Welcome to a cd filled with anger, sadness, and confusion. This cd gives new meaning to the genre soft rock, that being its not all bad. The singers scream or rap their way through a 12 track cd, targeting mostly angry teens. Just when you think one song is different, because the lead is quietly singing his way through emotional lyrics and a quiet guitar, it all jumps back to the angry, soft metal. The pros are that you get a mix of rap and metal, so most teens will be satisfied. The cons are only 12 songs."
4,Are you working out?,"If your interested in some good workout music go ahead and buy this one. I'm 31 so I'm not as young as the group of people that listen to LP but I enjoy it. You can listen to every song and can't really pick a favorite. This music really pumps me up and helps me get through my workout. I appreciate that there is no foul language, the lyrics are a little depressing but considering today's music it seems you can't listen to a decent tune without hearing the ""F"" word every other word. If you enjoy POD you'll enjoy this CD. I think these guys will be around a while, I'm anticipating there next CD."
4,Aiight with me.,"No bass player. Not a Nirvana. Not real music. These guys won't be around in twenty years. Whatever!! Just a few bad comments from other reviews, but just listen to the CD and YOU be the judge. I know when I did, I wound up listening to the whole thing and I scooped it up. I'm just a music fan who liked what he heard and these guys are good. If you liked their single In The End, then you'll enjoy the rest of the cuts on the disc. The guitars rock, the drums/tracks are slammin'(tight production), and then they threw in some cool rhyme verses with no profanity. That was a strong selling point as I didn't have to go hunt all over town for an edited version of this CD. Trust the other 600 or so positive reviews and your listening ear and add this one to your collection. Besides, holding a 4.5 out of 5.0 star rating over 600 reviews and going multi platinum means somebody's diggin' this CD. Don't miss out!"
4,Linkin Park Helped Me Through Some Ruff TImes,"I don't know why everyone is comparing Linkin Park to that pop crap. I mean.... yea they are on MTV but I think people have to look at the big picture: the music. Honestly, I HATE METAL and I really punk but this album proved me wrong. Songs like ""Papercut"" and ""Points of Authority"" have a good flow to them and Chester and Mike work well with each otehr vocally. This album made my expand my horizons a little bit to other music. I dont know why one of the reviewers thinks that Limp Bizkit is better than LP because LP has a sound of their own. Go ahead and consider them nu-metal or rap-rock or whatever but what they should be considered is just ""damn good music"""
4,Surprisingly good,I'm not really big into the hard rock/rap hybrid genre and probably never would have bought this CD if I hadn't seen Linkin Park on the Family Values Tour. They really stold the show! They were energetic and fresh and really had their own unique spin on the type of music they produce. So I bought the CD and was happy I did. They actually have talent and the songs have thought behind them - lyrically and musically - and the record is well produced. I definitely think they have some staying power.
5,By far the best CD of the year,"If I could rate this CD a 10 I would. Its Staind,Limp Bizkit,and Def Tones all packed in a 12 song CD. BUY IT!!!"
2,i used to like them but really they have no talent,i used to like them when iwas 10 but i hate it now the only reason i gave two stars is because of one step closer which isnt that great
5,Not for everyone (especially old generation),"Well, a lot of people don't like this CD as I can see on the review.LP whines too much? Well, if you want safe bets, why don't you listen to Britney or Christina? There you go, you won't hear them whine. Or you can some gangsta raps, don't you think they are cool with the gangs, drugs, f word every 30 seconds, murders, guns??? Go back to your Led Zeppelin or Metallica.Oh yeah, I forgot the saying, ""You can't teach old dog new tricks.""That's right, old people/generation, move on and keep listening to your old 70s 80s 90s metal."
5,One of the BEST albums Iv'e heard in awhile!!,"To compare this band to Limp Bizkit is an insult. Personnaly I don't believe they even come close. I'm a new Linkin Park fan and I got this cd after I saw them live at the Big Day Off Fest (an off Ozzfest concert) at Jones Beach and they were incredible. From Shinodo's smooth raps in tracks like ""By Myself"" transitioning to Chester's gritty metal edge takes you from a head bobbing lull to a head banging nightmare. This album is the best rock/metal combination since..... well, no one."
3,Hmmm,I sold this CD to my friend a couple weeks ago. At first I loved this CD but after awhile the songs just get repetitive. In The End is definetely the best song on the CD and track 10 whatever it's called but those get annoying after awhile also.
1,bad product,it could not do it as it saying do. It could not jump up my Toyota Avalon car. The power was far less.
5,"small, light, and works","My battery was dead so I bought with 2 day shipping. It arrived, I charged it up overnight, connected it to the car and let it trickle for 15-20 minutes, then turned the key -- the car started up. Compared to the price of having somebody come over to jump start the car, this starter has paid for itself already, and the 15-20 minutes I let it trickle was faster than waiting for somebody to arrive."
4,"GREAT ITEM TO HAVE , ESPECIALLY IF YOU WATCH TELEVISION AND LISTEN TO RADIO IN YOUR AUTOMOBILE...","My order was received promptly. I tried the jump start on my 04 Cadillac Deville , Drained my battery watching a movie , The first try was unsuccessful , but the second time it started with no problems.. i think this is a great item to have . Especially if you watch tv or listen to radio in your automobile.. thank you"
4,I used it 5x in one day!,I bought this as a lighting deal around black Friday and got a great deal on it. I have a fleet of business vehicles and I'm kicking myself for not buying a few more. Recently we had a faulty battery in one of our vans and we had to use this 5x in one day until I could get the battery replaced. It worked all 5 times without a recharge in between. The flashlight that comes with it is very cheap and dim but I could see it being useful if you were changing a tire or something. Nothing else.It is also fairly small and lightweight. I'd recommend it to anyone as an occasional backup incase of a dead battery.
4,Not a heap of cranking power in the long run but good for small cars,"I bought this as an emergency battery for taking wintery trips in a Nissan Murano. That vehicle has a 3.5 liter V-6 engine. On the one occasion I accidentally ran the battery down and tried using this, it did start, but the engine did not turn over very rapidly. Now, this is something that others had already reported in reviews, so I was not overly surprised.On the other hand, I have a small convertible with a 40cylinder engine that site in storage all winter long. The battery, even disconnected, needs to get a good zap of electricity it order to be used. This little marvel not only got the Miata started in under 5 seconds, it had enough power a week later to give a friend a ""jump"" in her Honda Accord. But again, that is a 4-cylinder engine.If you have a big honking truck or a Caddie, get something larger and more powerful. If you have a small car, this is more than a good deal."
4,Perfect for the compact car in your family!,"With my wife driving long distances and at odd hours I wanted her to never have to worry about a dead battery. This jump pack is lightweight and easy enough for her to use if she ever needs it. I top it off once a month just to make sure its always charged and ready to go. The 12v light is pretty useless but you never know it might just come in handy one day. The price is great compared to other jumppacks in this amp range as well. Just remember this is for a compact car, it probably would not work very well on a V8"
1,Horrible product,"This was the most horrible product I bought from amazon. First, the clamps are so thick that they won't fit on my car (2003 BMW e46) or my friends car (99 Subaru). Second I used another jumper cable to connect it to the car and it didn't have enough power to jump start the car. I used it as a charger to charge my battery to start the car. I am going to return it as soon as I can."
1,Not a jump starter,"I bought this before an extended trip I was taking thinking that my car batteries might die when I return. I had it plugged in so it would be fully charged. When I tried to jump my car, that's when I found the label that I had to connect it to my battery for at least 30 minutes to charge it. That was the first problem I ran into. How do I leave my hood up when it's parked on a street. I managed to work around that. After 30 minutes of ""charging,"" there was still no power in the battery. I did see that the light on it get dimmer, a sign that power is going to the car. I decided to leave it charging a bit longer. After a couple hours, all I had was a car that wouldn't start, and a dead jump starter that didn't jump start. Oh, in case you are wondering, the car's alarm was off, no lights were on, even dome light. The battery was 11 months old.This is NOT a jump starter. It will not charge your battery."
2,small fry,"the clore cs1000 carstart ultar-portable will not start a car or pickup truck,it will only start lawn mowers and motorcycles not good for cars, trucks"
5,It's better than flagging someone down for a jump start.,I have a Honda Civic and I've had to use this product on it at least 5 times. I used it at least 3 times without recharging it. It's a time saver because I don't have to inconvenience anyone to help me jump start my car.
5,car starter...,"Excellent price on a special. Our old one died and this a great replacement to have on hand in case you happen to leave a light on overnight and drain the battery down....this will get you speeding off to work without having to wait for AAA, or a neighbor with jumper cables!"
2,Cheap and Clumsy,"Do a little research on how many CCA cold cranking amps your Automobile needs to start it. This won't start a V 8 engine, as the new interstate battery I have in my car is a 665 cca, and it needs over 300 amps to turn the engine.I got a new Schumacher 6amp battery charger for what I paid for this and in 24 hours my battery was fully recharged. The light is almost a joke, but w/adapter it will power my Notebook PC."
5,Small but has lots of power,"I needed a battery pack to jump start my mower, but needed some thing small and lite, This battery pack answered all my needs."
2,Barely enough power to start some cars,"This unit is pretty weak. It barely starts a 4 cyl, let alone a 4 or 8 cyl vehicle. I bought this to have a small unit for roadside help for the occasional customer in need, and for a quickie parking lot jumper for customer's with weak or dead batteries. It can't even turn over 1 out of 5 cars. Pretty worthless......"
3,Jump Box,Small jump box and it will jump small vehicles. Just got it so not much to say except so far it is a good deal. Has a small light on the front for easy use.
3,CarStart Portable Battery,"This battery is much more portable than the previous one I had. The built-in flashlight is certainly handy for night problems. On the other hand, I tried to jump start a friend's truck and it didn't do the job. Using jumper cables with another vehicle did the trick."
4,review,"I have a very consistent library on weapons.This particular book was of interest to me especially for the information it contains on the life of most of the models dealt with, first of all the year of introduction and the year in which every single model has been discontinued by the manufacturer."
4,Standard Catalog Of Military Firearms: The Collector's Price & Reference G,Good reference book. Has nice comments on some of the more significant models. Not quite as inclusive as I would like but still very good.
3,Photos Illustrate Each Dance Step,LATIN DANCING will be useful for those who are already fairly familiar with some of these dances. I do not think the book will be helpful to those who are at the very beginning of the learning curve. The best feature of LATIN DANCING is the use of photos which illustrate each dance step in sequence.
4,Instant classic for MMA fans,"I put this documentary behind The Smashing Machine and in front of Rites of Passage on my personal top three MMA documentaries ever made list. If all goes well on 5/15 Dustin should be fighting for the UFC FW championship this fall or winter, I am holding my breath for a part 2 (Hint Hint Filmmakers)"
4,"Nice size and suction cups, but...","...it does not provide much traction. It's a great size and covers the entire bottom of my tub, which is great; the suction cups on the bottom really stick, which is also great. It doesn't curl at the edges, either. But the surface that you stand on is oddly smooth and slippery, making me wonder what the point of the whole thing is. If they improved the traction on this mat, it would be a five-star product."
4,Vangelis' late-70s acoustic sound,"In the years 1975-80 Vangelis developed a hard-to-match synthesis between acoustic instruments and synthesizers. One can year some good examples on Spiral (1977), See You Later (1980) and Short Stories (1980, with Jon Anderson). Opera Sauvage was conceived in this period and it sparkles with musical originality, dream-like themes. Hymne is a calm Vangelis theme, Rve a bluesy athmospheric piece. L'enfant is minimalistic but musically very remarkable. Chromatique and Irlande are new to Vangelis' composing styles, but nonetheless inspiring. Jon Anderson plays the harp in Flamants Roses, a multi-theme piece of instrumental action."
3,A pleasant piece of work,"Comprised of seven tracks, Vangelis' Opera Sauvage was released in 1979. The material is in a New Age musical direction. The songwriting, musicianship, and sound quality of the album are pleasing. My favorite compositions are ""Reve,"" ""L'enfant,"" and ""Chromatique."" With a length of almost 13 minutes, ""Reve"" is a well-written piece. At first, I found this composition to be pleasant, but meandering; after repeated listens, it grew on me, though. ""Reve"" is also relaxing, quiet, serene, beautiful, and captivating. The curious-sounding ""Chromatique"" displays a nice melody with an interesting, eerie keyboard timbre. The CD insert contains two color photos--one of these is of Vangelis. The disc is just over 43 minutes. Opera Sauvage is an album that I actually rate 3.5 stars. I recommend it."
2,get this for one song,"This cd has music that seesaws between pretty and pretty boring...but then you get to the song ""Hymn"". It is a drop dead, completely gorgeous and jubilant piece of work. As much as the other songs are unimportant, nothing, boring, stereotypcial, new age, synthesizer, schmaltz, ""hymn makes the whole purchase totally worthwhile.The song is that beautiful!"
2,Ok.,"after ""Bladerunner"" and ""The City"", I've been reviewing more of Vangelis' work. Opera Sauvage doesn't touch the quality or talent I was so impressed by in my first two album reviews, but its Ok.I've so far come to categorize Vangelis into three catagories: (1)Impressive, Spiritual & Moody (2)slightly boring, dated and unimpressive (3)Horrible ... as in the 1492 Soundtrack.A quick ""wtf?"" to anyone who gave 1492 a good review.Opera Sauvage falls into the category #2 for me."
5,Grandchildren' delight,"This was a gift for my grandchildren. They love Angelina and had recently been ice skating, so the book was an ideal gift."
1,Memmler's The Human Body in Health and Disease,There is some misinformation and lots of typos in this book. I would not rely on this study guide to pass an exam.
5,Definitive history of Hunter Arms/L. C. Smith Shotguns,Col. Brophy has collected all the records from L. C. Smith and it's predecessor Hunter Arms from Marlin just prior to distruction. This is a must for any collectors or historians of the L. C. Smith company and the specific shotguns they built.
4,where are we going?,"The book is a good attempt at peering into the future of mobile computing. In part, it does this by looking at the recent past, and the various projections made then about upcoming mobile trends. These predictions are evaluated against what actually happened. A sobering comparison. A lot of hype happened in the 90s dot com and telecom era. And mobile computing spanned both fields. Resulting in massive overbuilding of telecom networks and overbidding for 3G licenses. Billions of dollars, euros and yen were squandered in those efforts.So one lesson from the book is that predictions are always fraught with uncertainty. Hopefully, this engenders some caution and humility amongst the authors of the book's papers, and in the reader.The book studies future mobile technologies and wonders how these might turn out. Useful research ideas. Though nothing I read here really seemed to be a gripping, Eureka-type vision."
1,Only bad book written so far . . .,"This book is so bad I almost didn't finish it. The story is juvenile, as are the heroine and her boy friend (at least they have an excuse -- they are teen agers). They're on the run, skipping from planet to planet, but the bad guys always seem to know where they are. Hmmm. Boyfriend is the son of a supporter of the deposed regime. Mom sends him off with a backpack and tells him to help our heroine. Do you think mom might have planted some sort of locator on son and is using him (without his knowledge) to track our girl? The girl's ""uncle"" is by far the most interesting character - and he's left behind at the end of this book. I will read the reviews of book 2 in this series before I spend any money on it."
2,Are they going to waste time on No.2 ?,"I have all Lee&Miller; books and until this one I never was dissapointed. No plot to speak about, no characters to be interested in, no logic even in what is there (the group keeps running from their enemies, they keep repeating to themselves that now finally they lost the ""tail"" and they are nearly immediately found - perhaps it is time to check for hidden bugs? Especially as one of the heroes is so called ""licensed assasin"" and should have thought about this?). In fact, everything that made Liaden series so wonderful, is absent. If I got this book without a cover, I would never have thought it was written by the same authors.An attempt to write a young adult S/F - all I can say, Heinlein did it better."
3,Not their best,"While generally enjoyable, The Sword of Orion is OK in almost every way but never quite gets really good. Overall it reminds me of Heinlein's teenage books - though without quite the same innocence and bright edge of burgeoning space exploration. The characterization is fine - the people interesting enough, the plot is fine - but you're never surprised. I have tremendously enjoyed almost everything Lee & Miller have written - I suppose they can have a bad day. For Liaden fans I would say go ahead and read it so you can say you are truly dedicated fans. For those who aren't prior Lee & Miller fans I wouldn't start here."
1,Sword of Orion,"Sharon and Steve - what happened?Like many others I love the Liaden Universe. This is not it - this isn't even equal to a spider-man book! Yes, it ends with a cliff hanger (actually it just ends abruptly) - but frankly I don't care! I will not bother with the second part of the series.There were very few plot twists - mostly they run and keep getting caught. These people are supposed to be supremely smart and have survived undercover as revolutionaries for years, but haven't been able to figure that the bad guys keep finding them way too easy!I would suggest not reading this book and instead go read the real thing (Liaden Universe) or some Linnea Sinclair."
3,A teen adventure story,"All the time I was reading this I kept thinking - ""I know this plot! I've seen on kids TV adventure shows""....and that is what reading this book is like.The characters, while likeable, are mostly too young and too ill drawn to have much depth to them and the emphasis is on a cliff hanger ending so you will get the next book.I doesn't compare to the Liaden novels for world building and characters but if you don't mind a derivitive story its not too bad an outing for younger readers, though at times it seemed to drag."
2,Disappointing dross,"I purchased this book on the strength of an enthusiastic review & my enjoyment of other Lee & Miller books, and feel that I have completely wasted my money.Everything about the content of this book is poorly done - the plot is shallow, characterisation neglected, the language un-emotive. In contrast, the cover, quality of paper & binding were well chosen.This book will not appeal to fans of the Liaden series, nor of the series beginning with The Tomorrow Log. It is not written for adults. It would possibly appeal to early adolescents, but there are a plethora of more interesting and more entertaining novels suited to that age group.I am suprised that these authors have produced this drivel.All in all, extremely disappointing."
3,THEY'VE CAVED TO THE MONEY MONGERS!,"That's the only reason I can think of for not even finishing this story line. I don't mind serial books, and I really like cliff hanger endings, but everyone knows for that to work you have to at least finish ONE PLOT LINE within a single publication! This story is fun! But it ended with not one thing resolved, and that's just sloppy (or, more likely, greedy!). That is why 3 stars. They would have had a 4.5 stars for serving up of their usual fun space operas. Too bad they couldn't withstand the pressure to make money. Please, Lee & Miller, work on your priorities for next time! Otherwise, you will lose someone who's been with you since the beginning. And I can't afford to lose you! There are so very few good authors out there!"
2,Not Free SF Reader,"I presume this is supposed to be a kid's adventure novel, with the 2 main characters being kids on the run with an uncle, parents were rebel leaders, etc., etc. Good enough for that, but very lightweight otherwise, barring a few gates and some fun ways to take out a space fleet. A few too many aliens talk like they just came off the set of the Dark Crystal, though."
3,Kinda makes you think,"This is quite an interesting book of short stories. It warns that some of the stories are violent - and this is kind of the case. The first stories really have no point to them. But I found as the book went on, the stories got better.But as for these animals talking and having personalities - I found it quite hard to sink in. Nonetheless - it was well worth a read if there is nothing better to do on a rainy day. The other advantage of books like these is that the stories are short and only take a maximum of 30 minutes to read (depending on speed)."
1,Horribly disappointing and grossly overpriced.,"This book was a huge disappointment. It is a very thin paperback with a plastic comb binding, just like millions of charity/church cookbooks across America -- but at 3-4 times the price for this flimsy a book. The recipes are apparently untested collected from the authors' friends/families; many give vague directions. Most appear to have been copied from the internet (or, at least, are the same ones plastered all over the net) -- same old, same old. Worst, the authors address copyrighted information by acknowledging that they don't know the sources of poems/quotes. ... This [could have been fine for less money], but at their price, it is unbelievably grossly overpriced."
5,God is in this!,This is a totally annointed CD. I play it in my classroom and it makes an incredible difference. It's so peaceful that you could play it all day! God is really in it.
5,Michael Gettel Fan,I bought this album because I love the music of Michael Gettel from the Pacific Northwest. He plays the piano throughout the entire CD. I bought the special PIANO version of Change My Heart.
2,Hard to use,"This product doesn't work unless everyone is sitting around a table. If you have to sit at a table, you might as well use cards and chips."
3,How to Tune Swing,"The focus of the book is on tuning single user GUI (Swing,AWT) applications and as such, offers some good insight on this subject. Chaper 2, The Performance Process, Chapter 3, Measurement is Everything, and Chapter 4, I/O Performance although thin, offer practical information that extend beyond Swing. The focus in subsequent chapters narrows as the authors prepare the reader for the more advanced techniques used for tuning Swing applications. Those tuning server applications will find that they are not able to use a number of techniques or advice offered by the authors."
2,Very poor and shallow,"It's a shame that Sun fellows can only come with so little material about Java performance.Even JavaWorld articles contain more information about the subject. For example, whentalking about optimizing the serialization process all authors can offer is to set morefields to be transient. Is that all you can think of ? How about custom writeObject, folks ?When discussing data structures and algorithms all authors can say is ""choose accordingly,it depends"". Oh, thank you, I didn't know that ..Well, it seems to be that this books was written in a couple of days without any seriousresearch. Too poor and shallow. All I got from this book is a couple of factsregarding GC, HotSpot and some other things I didn't know before. And first chapters describedthe general tuning strategy pretty well, actually. But that's it. Shame on you, folks.Just read ""Java Performance Tuning"" by Jack Shirazi if you have nothing to say.Or at least make some Web-reserach before publishing a book."
4,Great Book but should have been more detailed,"I would definitely reccomend this book to someone who is not at all familiar with performance tactics in Java, but this book does not adds much to the much known tactics found on web or in the Dov Bulka's book.Since this book was from Sun Press I definitely expected more from this book considering the depth provided by other books from them. But this book kinda embarrased me by reiterating the tricks already known and introducing the esoteric concept of benchmarking and not providing much details with it.I hope somebody would come up with more exhaustive work in this field very soon...."
3,Buy it if you're a Swing developer,"Although this is a nice-to-have book (for bookworms like us which isn't after all?), I wouldn't really recommend it as the book to buy for Java performance any more, other than for people that are doing Swing, for whom it would indeed be greatly beneficial. Jack Shirazi's ""Java Performance Tuning"" is becoming the de facto standard Java performance book, and a second edition of it has come out, which is pretty up-to-date. On the other hand, Wilson's book is starting to show its age.Wilson (the main author) has worked on Sun's Swing team and then on the performance team in the late 90's and that is where he draws his experience from. This book is not geared toward people that do server-side Java (which I believe to be the great majority)."
3,Saved me a couple of times,"OK, so my initial impression of this book was similar to many others. It seemed thin and only provided a shallow treatment of the topic. After reading it I put it back on the shelf.Having said that, the couple of times I have hit a brick wall with performance problems that I couldn't solve with my own experience and skill, I have reached for this book and found an immediate and effective solution. You can't ask for more than that.If you are rewriting the Quake engine in Java, you will definitely need a book that covers the subject in more depth. If you are like me and only have the occasional need for performance tuning,this book may be all you need."
3,Not very helpful for experienced java developers,"I would definitely reccomend this book to someone who is not at all familiar with performance tactics in Java, but this book does not adds much to the much known tactics/tips/tricks used in everyday programming or found on web.Since this book was from Sun Press I definitely expected more from this book considering the depth provided by other books from them. But this book embarrased me by reiterating the tricks already known and introducing the esoteric concept of benchmarking and not providing much details with it.Being a java developer since last 5 years, I didn't learn anything new from this book except the concept of benchmarking which this book brushes lightly without really explaining it well.Sincere advice: Don't spend your money on this one."
5,"Please release this ""Buona Sera Mrs. Campbell"" movie on DVD!","I remember watching this Gina Lollobrigida movie with my family many many years ago. We enjoyed it very much. My sister and I recently saw ""Mama Mia"" at the theater. It has the same story line but we would both love to own this older movie because it was a childhood favorite. I think other baby boomers would love it too!"
5,Funny and charming,"I bought this after seeing ""Mama Mia"" - that brought back vague memories of this movie so I looked it up. Frankly it's better than Mama Mia, and it's disappointing that the makers of that movie didn't even have the class to credit this one as inspiration and source. Gina Lollobrigida is beautiful and very funny in this, along with Telly Savales, Phil Silvers, and Shelley Winters turning in great performances. Very enjoyable."
5,Why no DVD,"Somebody is missing the boat by not releasing a DVD of this wonderful little comedy while there is so much interest in Mama Mia. Too close a story line to be a coincidence and maybe a better plot than the ABBA vehicle. Both movies have a certain charm which dilutes the risque undertones. On balance, I prefer the Gina Lollobrigida outing, no offense Meryl! It would have been nice if the producers of Mamma Mia had given some credit to the forerunner."
1,this DVD is PAL format...,This DVD is PAL format...it doesn't play in US...was not told about format prior to purchase... it's a bummer since it's a funny movie...
4,Why is this film not in DVD?!?!?!?!!!,"I saw this movie many, many years ago and have been looking for it. Just a light, fun-filled film with some great actors. Really good entertainment without the usual smarmy sex scenes. A movie that has lasted through the decades as is evidenced by the reviews. Please, will someone make it into a DVD? My VCR died so DVDs is what I use. How about the movie being played on the TV networks. That would surely prompt viewers to look for it. PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE!!!!!!!!!Buona Sera Mrs Campbell"
1,Unwatcheable!,"I bought the Region 2 import from Spain DVD of ""Buona Sera Mrs. Campbell"", one of my favourite movies. The copy I received is a burnt DVD-R. The picture quality is atrocious, worse than a VHS tape recorded at EP speed. The English soundtrack plays on the right channel only, the Spanish track plays stereo on both channels.This DVD version of this movie is totally unwatcheable! This is the DVD with the picture of 3 guys and 2 women on the cover with the title ""Buona Sera Sra. Campbell"" in the center in yellow letters."
5,Gina is GEAT!,"This 40 year ""young"" movie is just top, top, top. The beauty and talent of Gina and the humour of Telly Savallas are unbeatable. The recent movie ""Mamma Mia"" with Meryl Streep is just a poor imitation of this one."
3,It works,"I originally bought one of these from ebay, and it lasted for a few weeks, and broke. Then I bought another one from Amazon. This one was basically the same, maybe a little bit different, but basically the same thing. I had it for a few weeks again, and it broke in the same place, but I think it was my fault; I got it caught on my steering wheel when I tried to stand up in my van.It breaks in the place where it clips to your belt. The pins simply are cheap and cannot take much abuse. I just bought another one because I need a belt clip. I buy this one because it is so inexpensive ($5 including shipping). I think if you are careful enough it should work. I seem to always break things by being careless."
3,I finally found it....,"Bought this CD for 1 song and 1 song only ""Good To Go Love"". Although ""Ain't Nothing Going On But The Rent"" was clearly the bigger hit on the album, my favorite song is ""Good To GO Lover"". Been looking for this CD for years, found it on the internet (God, you gotta love the internet)Rick"
5,Shelley rocks Chopin,Beautiful rendition of Preludes and 2nd sonata. I have heard others but all somehow lack a certain sensibility to the subtle modes of Chopin. This pianist is in touch with the perfect timing and flourishes of the preludes as Chopin must have intended them--truely haunting and inspiring at the same time.. a triumph
3,Toshiba PCX1100U high speed cable modem - proble with music,"what is the deal with this cable modem as far as music web sites? It doen't seem to able to play videos simply without a lot of interruption or just absolute stopage. I use the Jango web page regularly prior to purchasing this modem without problems. Now, I can't seem to play a single music video without a full stop loading with no further continuation of the video after waiting several minutes. The modem I have also seems slower than the lower level modem that I originally leased from the cable company."
4,router,"Maybe it was just the box being so faded and the people on the box dressed for an early 90s party or something, but I was sort of expecting something a little newer. Maybe I just interpreted the description incorrectly. I dont know. As soon as I find the last cord that was supposed to be in the box, I'll give it a whirl and see how it goes."
2,Great Until it Dies,"The reason I'm on here is I'm looking for a replacement to mine, the one I was renting from Cox, which died after about 5 months- of course, who knows how long it was used by someone else. But it's not the first time a Toshiba product has acted up in our house. I'm going to try a different manuf."
3,PA Hunter,"I purchased these boot insulators to use in a tree stand during rifle, bow, and flintlock deer season below 30 degrees. These boot covers do what they claim. However, from a hunter prospective they are bulky to carry, make a lot of noise when you move your feet or rub them together. I used them twice then decided they were more trouble than they are worth to carry and put on. I can get the same or better results using the stick on chemical foot warmers inside of my boots. I would recommend putting the extra cost of this item in to a better boot and the chemical foot warmers.PA Hunter."
1,Very few printers supported,"Don't get me wrong... this router works great, as a router. But not as a print server. Very few printers are supported, and Belkin doesn't tell you that until after you buy it. So bottom line, make sure you check and see if your printer is supported before you buy this for a print server. Mine didn't make the list.http://web.belkin.com/support/printserver/list.asp"
5,Belkin Router over Linksys Any Day!,"Product exactly as advertised, works great! Easy installation. In general, have had a lot of success with Belkin products.Previous router was Linksys, which I spent 2 days trying to install, with no luck. Tech support was awful, long delays, service rep was rude and unhelpful. Finally returned it and bought Belkin instead, which I had up and running in 15 minutes."
1,buy something else,Limited number of compatible printers. Requires frequent resetting. I liked my netgear so much better. Useless as a print server. I can't wait to upgrade to something else.
1,COMPATIBLE ink is NOT COMPATIBLE,These are not worth the little money you save when your printerbecomes clogged with COMPATIBLE ink cartriges
1,bad buy,"I purchased one black cartridge and it worked fine for awhile. Got about half full and had problems. Bought from ink revolution again, figuring I'd give it another chance because the price was right. I always figured you get what you pay for but gave it a chance again. Will pay more and get it right next time. Cheaper is not always better. I learned the hard way. I give it one star because 0 wasn't an option."
5,"If you appreciate history, you'll be inspired by this.","I thought that the programme was brilliant. If you're interested in history and humanity without looking through a veil of dogma then this programme is for you. Only PBS could put together such a programme. A network which is dependent upon corporate advertising could never produce a serious programme about Jesus and the movement which he inspired, without offending those who have an inflexible view of reality. This programme really makes you think. I guess that's what scares some people."
2,Disappointing,"Disappointing is the word that comes to mind. I had hoped for a more historical and accurate account of Christian beginnings that I could use as a teaching resource. Unfortunately, I found that the views of the ""scholars"" were filtered through a veil of tired secular revisionism. More akin to ""The Da Vinci Code"", the writers weave an account of Christianity that is neither biblical or historical; wishful thinking replaces scholarship. I have noticed that since 2001 (when this series was released) a bit more balanced use of scholars has emerged from similar documentaries. If the series writers had presenting both liberal and conservative views together at least we would have been give a glimpse of the controversies in bold contrast rather than only a docufiction."
3,"Jolly good rock and roll on the first song, but then it drops somwhere in outer space.","The first track on this CD Large Time has much of the same qualities that the best ZZ Top songs , lets called it fastback, hardtop, sprint, real rock and roll music. Large Time is under 3 minutes, but the beginning just blew me away, man. Then it shifts gear into a ballad hybrid, which is a let down in a way, and the stars fell down to 4. Little boring thing, this one. And then we get a another ballad, which is even worser. Oh,oh. It` sounds like poorman Jeff Lynne with ELO (Electric Light Orcestra). But we are soon back in business with Track 4 Champagne Love, which was a small hit for the band back in the 70 ths. Track 5 Imaginary Lover has god lyrics, but it`s sounds like poor mans Moody Blues. For the great 5 star beginning im sorry to say it ended in the middleway. Anyway Track 1 Large Time is worth the whole album. Woah is the right word to describe that listning experience."
4,Worth the Wait!,This hard-to-find CD is worth the wait - it moves me whether I'm in my car or in my kitchen.
5,Satisfaction Guaranteed !!,"Quality products,very competitive pricing,excellent customer service and prompt shipping. That says it all. Will recommend."
5,Excellent resource,"I consider this book, along with the gross and fine motor skills books, my primary written resources for working with my 7mth son with Down Syndrome. The information is clearly written, easy to understand and comes with activities that you can do to help with speech skills. I use these books to supplement what we have learned from the early intervention therapists. I highly recommend them for any new parent of a child with Down Syndrome."
5,Nice helpful tips,"Nice tips for helping, I got this book for myself and one for the local school system I liked it so much. thanks"
3,"PASSED WITH A 65, BUT I THOUGHT THAT I FAILED THE TEST!","Book could, and should be improved by publisher.Half way through the test, I started thinking about ""deleting"" the results so that I could test again after getting better studying material.The book did not cover a lot of what was on the test. What pulled me through with a 65 was my love of history, luck and the process of elimination.Here is a hint: study up on American history between reconstruction and the great Depression. Much has happened to this country in that time period that is not common knowledge.Good luck."
2,REA CLEP History Guide Needs Improvement!!,"The REA CLEP History of the US I study guide is in need of improvement and/or revision! The format of the book and the accompanying CD-ROM isvery usable...but the problem is that the information in it has little tonothing to do with the real exam that was taken yesterday. The actual exam results were 20 points less than I scored on each of the 3 practice exams in the book. These practice exams and explanations gave a falsesense of readiness. I wish I would have used the actual study materials from the College-Level Examination Program (CLEP). When I called REA about the difference between the study guide's practice exams and the actual exam....they said I should write a review online? So, I am alerting people to use other study materials than this REA study guide (published in 2006). It resulted in wasted time and money for me."
3,"Good, as a base but do A LOT of outside studying.","This book was very helpful, I just wish it were harder because the CLEP test for this was was more difficult than the book. I was getting 80 percent of the practice tests, yet on the real thing I got 5 points over the passing grade. Wish it had a CD Test too."
3,disappointed,"I was very excited to get these, the pushup bars, the card (which were missing), the dvd's skip and freeze. I got a faulty used set, sold as new. Very disappointed. There was no paperwork at all included. Very very disappointed."
4,Good for the beginning collector,"Don't expect a Heinlein collection, he's the editor. The stories are all very good when they are not excellent. But you would expect that from Heinlein's picks. However most have been anthologized to death, so watch out for duplications in your library before you buy. It's still a good buy if you only need 3 or 4 of the stories."
5,the compnay is now Blue Spring,I ordered this product just last month and let me tell you it is the best that I have ever had. I have problems with my spine and I was looking and looking for a product that I did not have to take internally. I was in a car accident a few years ago and never fully recovered from it. I have trouble with my upper back muscles that then to pull on my spine a great deal. I use this product and it sooths that pain and I can go about my daily activities. I even found the companies web site that is www.bluestuff.com that has a lot of other products as well. You will not be sorry that you tried this product really for any pain that people have. SuperBlue takes the pain away so I can have a life!!!!!
4,It Works,"Although pricey, this lotion really works. After rubbing the lotion on the affected area, in about 5 minutes the pain is gone. I will order more when this one runs out."
3,SuperBlue Helped Some,SuperBlue helped some for aching finger knuckles. It did nothing for my wife's Shingle nerve damage pain in her foot and leg. I believe it is overrated.
4,Very good cream for pain relief to do massage with!,Great pain relief cream and easy to massage with. I also use and recommend biofreeze for athletes and poeple who work out. Have a friend with fibromyalgia and she uses biofreeze gel and superblue pain relief cream for her muscle pains. I do recommend it!
4,SuperBlue Pain Relief Cream,"Works good. I really like that it doesn't smell like most ""pain creams"" and it does a great job. Only complaint is it is a wee bit pricey. I recommend it."
4,It Works,"I really don't understand what this product does, but it seems to work on aches, pains, sore muscles and the like.My wife, my mom (at 94 years of age), my children, and I love this stuff. I don't think it will help serious cases of arthritis, of cancer pain, but for the everyday problems, it's great."
3,Pain Relief Due To Idiopathic Peripheral Neuropathy (IPN),I use SuperBlue Pain Relief Cream before bedtime on my IPN prickly pain ridden hands since the RX pain medicines diminish before morning and it extends pain relief to the time I take my AM RX medications. It helps me get to sleep and stay asleep except for bathroom breaks.There hasn't been much significant medical research (even to help control the pain)to help the millions of americans who have IPN. The use of SuperBlue Pain Relief Cream is only the result of my own efforts to find something to reduce the pain and help me sleep.I also used it when I had similar IPN pain in my lower legs and feet until the pain disappeared and my lower legs and feet went numb.
4,great though not perfect,"Initially this wrap feels wonderful, but after a little while you might find it to be a little hard. Still it does feel great to start with and its hard to turn down the wonderful smell the herbs give off and the fact that it can be warmed in the microwave and it's so easy to clean. You won't regret getting it. :)"
5,Brilliant - Superb - 5 stars are not enough,"Keith Tippett, Elton Dean and friends, as always, amazing me every time I hear them."
4,Wargames,"If you have ever seen the movie wargames, you should know that there are no winners in Global Thermonucluar War. That is why the object of this computer simulation of the movie wargames is not to win, but simply to lose the least amount of people.There are 5 DEFCON'S in the game. At DEFCON 5, you are allowed to build your defences and missile silos. At DEFCON 4, you are allowed to continue building, but you should start moving your ships into enemy territory to start scouting. At DEFCON 3, you are allowed to launch bombers and fighters. You are also allowed to engage enemy fleets. At DEFCON 2, you should start selecting targets for your missiles. You should target other silos with your bombers and large cities with your missiles. At DEFCON 1, you can launch your nuclear missiles and take out your enemies. But be careful, because even if you think you took out all their nukes, there is always a counterstrike.I love this game and I can't stop playing it."
1,Want High Tension Strategy Game?,Look elsewhere. The game is just terrible. I'll save you the effort of playing - the computer wins every time.
2,BOOOORING,"The game is very basic, I was bored almost immediately. The tutorial is pretty good and the software works well with XP (the reason I didn't give the game one star). I'd give a more extensive review but there isn't much content to review. The multiplayer portion of the game worked well though but was equally zzzzzzzzzzz........."
5,Combines classic and time-tested home recipes with the motherly tips and advice of an experienced cook,"A welcome contribution to the ""Mama's Kitchen"" series, The Mexican Mama's Kitchen: Authentic Homestyle Recipes combines classic and time-tested home recipes with the motherly tips and advice of an experienced cook, such as ""When deseeding chilies, be as careful as possible. Try to wear rubber gloves and avoid rubbing your eyes"" and ""To make vanilla sugar, add one vanilla pod to 2 cups sugar. Set aside for 3 weeks and then mix. Use to sweeten hot drinks as a sugar alternative."" Recipes such as Bricklayer-Style Eggs, Green Rice, Black Burner Beans, Mexican Hot Chocolate and many more are presented not only with methodical instructions, but also a brief introduction describing how the recipe has been used in families for generations. A handful of color photographs illustrate The Mexican Mama's Kitchen, a very highly recommended and easy-to-use family cookbook."
4,Nice collection.,"For those who have never heard of Donna Regina, they are a German electronic, trip hop duo in the vein of Lali Puna and Saint Etienne. Collection of Little Secrets is essentially a collection of the ""Best of."" While I was lucky enough to come across Late and Northern Classic, finding anything else by them is very difficult, so this is a good album for people like me who are unable to track down many of their other releases."
4,Relaxing (Not Boring),"I believe the Genre she falls into is Electronica - Indie Pop & Indie Electronic (says allmusic guide) & WOW I never knew it existed or would have liked it so much from the description. Her Style is very soothing - beautiful voice with just the right tones behind it. She wraps you in sound. It feels good I swear. My theory is that if the album has 3 good songs it's worth buying... Donna has 6 (1-6) the rest of the album is good also but not AS good. Some of the highlights for me are; ""Why"", Who's You Who's Me"" & ""Star Ferry II"". I can't see why anyone who truly appreciates music won't like this. You'll feel good that you found this gem before your friends."
4,Classic L'Amour,"When it come to Loius L'Amour this is as good as it gets. It's the classic battle of good versus evil. These books are always predictable, but they're still fun. You know what's going to happen before you open the book and yet the journey is still enjoyable. If you enjoy easy to read books with plenty of old west action pick this one up."
3,the ultimate vintage book,Simply stated this is the best vintage book ever published. I am ordering a second copy as I keep the first in the wine cellar for making selections and need a second for my library so my guests can see what they are drinking. There is none better!!!
4,Toy,"The only thing my grandson wanted was a holster for his gun. Couldn't find one, so had to get the whole sheebang.He was thrilled."
4,aging well???????,"this group was good back in the early ac/dc days when rose tattoo was still around, now, the music seems dated, good for old memories from late 70's and early (very early) 80's, i liked the songs ''ivory stairs'' and ''mr. damage'', problem was, they went under the name ''angel city'' in the US , causing plenty of confusion, '' doc neeson'' was a great front man and the brewster brothers played it straight with good results, bigger in australia (homeland) than they ever were here"
4,Good as long as your expectations are reasonable,"This is a large lens that will not degrade your image horribly, but some glare and chromatic aberration is obvious. It will help get that wider shots indoors, but you should expect lower contrast, less sharpness and some colored outlines, specially at the edges.I tried some cheaper ($40) Kenko at a store, those were REALLY unusable. Sony's is a decent quality one, although extremely overpriced. Don't expect to find 0.2x, 0.5x and have no vignetting, geometric and chromatic distortions."
3,Macon,"I, like others, bought this book for research. It is exhaustive for chronology and developmental. The problem with this and other books on airships is the lack of information on the construction and enumeration of the components of this class of airships."
3,Cheap darts!,These are horrible darts. They are cheaply made and have no grip. They are not very consistant in flight. The balance almost seems like it is off. They also rust pretty easy.
5,More Polished Doesn't Mean Not As Good,"On this, their major label debut, old fans complained about the lack of samples, and noise. Sure, that's true. and it does make for a different listening experience. But it does not ""rock"" any less, it would still be considered ""difficult"" by most pedestrian rock fans. The riffs are huge like the grand canyon, the beats are in your face; complicated and yet ""swing-able"" It's been over ten years since this came out, and it's still the Steel Pole I have in the car. I keep this at the ready alongside Motorhead's No Remorse, The Jesus Lizard's Goat, Laughing Hyenas' Life Of Crime, and Devo's New Traditionalists.A forgotten gem from a great era."
4,A different kind of rock experience...,"This album, chock full of strange lyrics and music both haunting in melody and vocals, is definitely a fresh look at rock music (sorta like that detachable penis song but not quite as comical). I saw them perform a couple years ago with Faith No More, bought the album and have been hooked ever since. In this case, its worth the few bucks to try somethin new..."
3,Pop-like and mediocre,"This album from steel pole bathtub starts out good with great guitar work and driving beats but loses its edge. More pop inspired beats than their previous works. Dish out the extra money to get ""tulip"" or ""some cocktail suggestions"" which are a lot better than this one."
5,An art form that will always amaze me,"Using a large number of small images to create the impression of a larger image is an art form that I find fascinating. In this book, Silvers presents 28 photomosaics, everything from classic artwork such as the Mona Lisa to images from Star Wars. For most of the images, a blow-up of a small section is included so that you can see the structure of the image.In general, the small images are of objects related to the large image. For example, the image of Bill Gates, for years the richest man in the world is constructed using images of paper money around the world. The image of Darth Vader is constructed using images from the Star Wars series of movies. I found this to be one of the most interesting collections of artwork I have ever looked through."
4,cute alarm clock,"I bought this for my 6 year old niece who loves pigs. The clock comes in a package with an opening through which you can press a button to test the alarm. I did this and it worked, however, when my niece tried to use it, the clock didn't run. To the company's credit, they replaced the clock promptly with one that worked fine."
1,Weak,"I was looking for a factual acount of the Newhall Incident. The author's attempt at clairvoyance was of no interest to me. A more prophylactic discussion of the aftermath of the shootings, and the measures instituted by the CHP to prevent this type of tragedy from ever happening again would have been far more interesting. The book borders on more fiction than fact. From my standpoint the book was disapointing."
3,Hidden Microphone?,"I was 30 miles away the night of that tragedy, following the situation in real time on the radio, so the event was seared into my memory. The weakness of this book is the amount of speculative diagogue written of the killers leading up to that shootout. Whatever their motivation or their troubled background, they're just a couple more hardened criminals undeserving of the notoriety. I would have expected more from the CHP author about his fallen comrades and the impact on their families than was written."
5,Excellent Service!,Excellent service and turnaround time! Would definitely deal with this seller again!
2,Good PR Job,"Back in AD 1964, the sordid details of Joe Kennedy's life were kept secret. So what you have here is a very incomplete picture. But, if you want to understand his stock trading or his ambassadorship to Great Britain, then this book is for you. But compared to Kearns-Goodwin and Kessler, this is very lop-sided."
2,Too Dry to Read,"This book reads like a a middle school textbook. I found it impossible to read more than a page w/o falling asleep. After a chapter,I gave up. If you want to learn about Joe K.,look elsewhere."
2,Bad Design,"This is a metal bracket and it partially worked on my motherboard. No complaints about the upper part of the bracket, the part that the fan attaches to. The X design of the lower portion of this bracket leaves me scratching my head. After installing it, my machine would not boot. The cpu pins on the underside of the motherboard were touching the bracket and shorting to each other. Bad design. Fortunately, the lower part of my old plastic bracket worked for attaching the upper part. Just be aware when installing this bracket that it isn't touching the pins on the underside of your motherboard."
3,Things that make you go hmm...,"I bought this replacement retainer for the dell at work, and it is by far better then the original plastic piece that brakes after time from the heat. But Ive found it rather annoying and extremely difficult to find the latches to hold the retainer down. One latch is missing so I had to jerry rig it with a rubber band on the side that is missing, and thats just temporary cause the heat, again, breaks the rubber band after some time. I think this product would be 100 times better if they sold the matching replacement latches with it, I would indeed pay a little more if that would have been the case, but without these latches this product is only half way decent and thats why I only gave it 3 stars. Even if one already has latches is would be nice to get matching ones for the reatainer."
5,"imperfect production,great songwriting",I have listened off and on to this tape for several decades and am challenging everyone reading this review to judge this CD for themselves.This is good music from an outstanding artist.Period...
3,Iso-Tip 7800 replacement battery,"The battery fit in all respects except for the terminal tab that goes at the bottom. That tab was not installed correctly such that it would reach the screw down post. I had to go to a Batteries Plus store to have them replace it with one that would fit. This is a manufacturing problem, not a distributor problem. The part I ordered came in a timely manner as promised."
3,Felka - Stromlinienbaby,"A not-entirely-successful fusion of free jazz, drum 'n' bass, and rock-n-roll electric guitar. Unfortunately, the elements don't integrate well, which results of a musical hodgepodge that never quite comes together. There's an odd ambient track, ""Q-Brick,"" stuck right in the middle of the album too. Strange. Still, an admirable effort with some good grooves."
4,No problems here!,"I'm not sure why people are complaining about the color! They match my wifes KitchenAid stand mixer and Tea Kettle perfectly, looks like KitchenAid red to me. The knives are very sharp and comfortable to handle and the scissors work great, especially for opening all those plastic packaged products you buy at the store. At this price (49.99 shipped), I only have 2 complaints 1) Only 6 steak knives not 8 and they're not serrated (I knew this before I purchased) 2.) Pearing knife seems a little flimsy. So far no rust, however, like all decent knives, you should NEVER EVER put them in the diswasher. If you want dishwasher safe, go to Wal-Mart/Target and buy a cheaper $20 set. Overall, great price and the cook is very satisfied.... By the knife set."
2,Maroon and Marooned,"I was a little dissapointed when I opened the box to discover that the set was not actually bright red, as appears in the photo, but a dark red to almost maroon. The knives themselves are of pretty miserable quality. The shorter knikes are okay, but the longer knives are thin, flexible, and don't hold a sharp edge. Save your money and buy just one or two good knives."
4,Very Nice,Very nice knife set. Carousel is a BIT larger than I expected but I love it... Knives are good quality - love the silicone handles.
4,Fairly good quality,"I got this knife set to round out our KitchenAid 'red' collection. So far, I have owned these knives for over a year. They continue to hold up fairly well, even taking the abuse of the dishwasher when I am too lazy to hand wash them. I periodically resharpen all of my knives and they do seem to hold their edge. No knife will hold its edge forever and they do require maintenance. Sure, they are not top of the line knives, but they do get the job done. I would recommend these knives to anyone wanting affordable knives that hold up well."
4,Kitchenaid cutlery,"The knives are well made and very sharp. Time will tell whether or not they will hold an edge but judging by Kitchenaid's past performance I don't expect any problems in that respect. The carosel is very attractive sitting on the kitchen counter, however, if it is under a cabinet it must be moved to remove the longer knives. Overall, I am pleased with this product and would buy it again."
2,It is NOT red!,"The knives are great, but the rotating carousel is maroon color. It doesn't match the knives, which are actually bright red. The carousel is also very large in size and doesn't look as good as it does in the pictures. I read a review about it being maroon, and thought that maybe that is just one person's opinion, but it turned out to be TRUE. If you are buying it for the color - don't."
4,Comfort food receipes from Agnes and Agnes...Texas Grandmas,"Cooking with Texas Grandmas is a fun read with down home, comfort food receipes and wonderful family photos. Not being from Texas, I would have never picked this cookbook up in a store, however a friend suggested I obtain it as I love old photos and family style cookbooks. Glad I did, as everyone will recognize a few of their family favorites and some ""Agnes and Agnes"" variations on Sunday dinner standards. However, the most interesting receipe is for making pickles...in a washing machine...which horrified this Yankee, but I find myself looking at my Maytag with a new perspective."
5,Timeless advice on interviewing,"This is one of those books that, like Strunk and White's ""The Elements of Style,"" should never be out of vogue. Brady's tips on interviewing and his discussion, too, of what does NOT work, are essential for journalists but also anyone who wants to succeed in the business world -- or in any job requiring ""people skills."" Good interviewers are good listeners. I was in the journalism field for nearly three decades and kept going back to this book for refreshers. I still find it useful in my current job; in fact, I just bought my third copy."
4,A great book.,"I have never played the Caro-Kann before, but after reading this book I began playing it and winning more than I had been. I was able to understand the ideas in the book and began to build a solid position every time I played the Caro-Kann. I was also able to beat an IM rated 2350 due to the understanding of the Caro-Kann that this book gave me. However, Mr. Schiller doesn't cover much in regard to the Advance Variation, but then again you can't have everything just one book. In my amateur opinion, this is an excellent book if one would like to learn the Caro-Kann."
2,Why the dishonesty?,"This is a book about the Caro-Kann defense. A perfectly respectable opening to play, and Schiller presents many variations and practical ideas. All well and good. But why is the book called a ""complete defense""? It IS -- if you ONLY play the Caro-Kann. But one might as well play only the Dutch and call it a ""complete defense to queen pawn opening"", or only 1. Nf3 and claim to have a ""complete opening system for White""."
4,Stylish,"The Senegal is another stylish Ben Sherman shoe, which are terrific for large foot sizes due to their light weight. The only problem is that they are not good for a lot of walking as the heel padding simply isn't enough."
3,Ok but not for me,"I think the book is Ok in that it tells a lot of biographical information about the author and how she got through certain patience trials with her in her life. However, I was hoping for more practical spiritual advice. Although it does cite specific biblical passages they seem to me a little bit like they were used to plug in this passage for this situation. For example, there are usually a list of passages regarding patience towards the end of each chapter but out of context, they are not very helpful. I guess it was too general rather than specific. I do appreciate the author's efforts though and I guess as a first step this might be ok."
5,I Love This Book,"I just got done reading A Mother's Journey To Patience written by Cynthia DeVaughn. This book is a must read for every mom. It tells of her weakness, her strength, the love for her children, and most of all her love for God. She tells of the most important ingredient that we need in our life to raise our children to be happy, and healthy; The most important ingredient that helps us to have patience, to make it through the trying times of being parent; The ingredient is the love of our Heavenly Father. This book is very inspiring it will be an inspiration to new parent, as well as the parents of teenagers; Even if your children are grown this book will bless you. The best message of this book is we all as parents need God's guidance to raise these beautiful gifts we have been given and without God's guidance how can we teach them correctly."
4,Brief and touching,"Do not let this book's brevity fool you. In so few words, it tells a story of a life time, and gives a panoramic view of the strange age that he lived in."
3,Engaging,"Andrei Makine told an engaging story of a character before, during, and after the war. It was told from a third person point of view, which I didn't really care for, and think the story could have been better told if it was told from first person. Makine did an excellent job taking you to the place by his descriptions. He paints a very vivid picture with his choice of words, and uses an extensive vocabulary. I enjoyed the story. Although the story was short, it got the point across very well. Great story, but did I enjoy it enough to read it again, no."
4,Worthwhile for reading and reference,"I only read a few chapters, on ""one man one vote"" decisions, and skimmed a few others, so this is not a full-scale review. Despite the editor's ingenuous but severe left-wing slant, both in his selections and in his comments, this is still a valuable book. It reveals in a way that no other work could, what really went on behind many of the key Supreme Court decisions that re-shaped American politics, government, and life. If you believe that personalities don't influence history, or that the Court is above politics, this book might correct your misapprehensions. One palsied hand resting on the Supreme Court bench has wrought revolutions deeper than any mob."
5,Love it!,I love it it is a great book. I love it because it isnt just an ordinary cookbook it has a kinda of a story when the girl makes it. I tried one of the recipes and it is great!!!!!! I recomend!!!!! No flaws. Worked great on my fire.
5,Delightful Book!,Brings back the good old days in Grandma's kitchen. Can not wait to share this book with my niece and nephew.
5,great book,this book is great.it was written such a lo ng time ago it is not just for grade schoolers.it has a lot of recipes and there good one too.which is better than you can expect.
2,A little cook book for a little hirl,I was hoping for an actual cookbook when I got this because I like to try new things. Then when I found out is was a actual book I started to read it and I didn't care for it.But that doesn't mean you wont like it. MAYBE I should've read reviews first. Lol
3,Chilly and uninvolving,"A dysfunctional French family gathers for Christmas for several days of confrontation and angst.The fine cast kept me engaged for the film's lengthy running time, but in the end I was left unsatisfied. Many of the conflicts between family members were difficult for me to understand, their reactions either overblown or mysterious without the benefit of a revelation to account for it. I was also put off by the chilly relations between family members and some of the gimmicks of director Arnaud Desplechin. I suppose cinema is more an emotional medium for me than a cerebral one; I appreciate a film that gives me something to contemplate, but it must hook me by engaging my emotions first, and this film didn't do that."
2,Bootleg Streaming Version???,I had to stop watching this about 5 minutes into it. It looks like someone took a video camera to a movie theater to record it. Awful streaming quality. Audio is terrible. This is obviously not a review of the film content itself.
4,A quick read worth a look,"This is Ruth Sawyer's first book, written in 1915, and made into a silent film in 1917. It is the story of a charity hospital for children, in particular the ward for ""incurable"" children and it's head nurse, Margaret MacLean, who was at one time a patient there. The story takes place during one day, May-Eve, which also happens to be a day that the hospital trustees come to visit. During this visit the trustees decide to close the incurables ward in favor of an additional surgical ward. However, on May-Eve, fairies walk the earth and take a hand in the decision. It is a book of its time, rather sentimental and with an obligatory happy ending, but for all that an enjoyable, quick read. You can't do better at the price, free as a public domain book.Ruth Sawyer is better known as a children's author. Her best known work is Roller Skates, which won the Newbury Award in 1937."
1,More gibberish from the good professor,"What a dreary tome. Ms. Professor Williams has a unique ability to obscure the most obvious and trite revelations in pedantic and turgid prose that she thinks is thrillingly poetic because the words are long-winded and flowery. and that's when she's making sense, which isn't very often. the rest of her writings tend to be either outright calls for more preferences for her preferred friends camouflaged as courageous iconoclasm, or just plain idiocy posing as intellectually daring originality. Sadly enough, if Thomas Kuhn is right, we'll have the likes of Professor Pat around for another couple of decades. (But hey, if you have the money, you can always sign up for the Nation's annual cruise and talk about the revolution with Pat and the gang for a mere 8 grand or so....)"
3,Collectivist Legal Theory,"Patricia Williams uses convoluted analogies to illustrate her assertions that greatly detract from her book. She openly admits that she is a legal collectivist in the traditional sense with a strong belief in maintaining group rights, group priveleges, group responsibilities, etc. Famous legal collectivists in the past have included VI Lenin, Stalin, Adolf Hitler, Pol Pot, General Mengitsu, General Pinochet, Idi Amin, and Mao. They also were fervent believers in group rights, group guilt, and group punishment. The Nuremberg Race Laws (1936) in Germany are a fine example of legal collectivism taken to its logical extreme."
2,Misnomered Poetry,"Williams is a lawyer, and in the book she tries to publish her essays in law reviews. Her essays are very emotional and more than lacking direction. she even says in the essay ""The Death of the Profane"" that she tries to write in a poetic style. A bit too poetic and emotional. Her opinions are valid though. This is all based on the filters of her perception, her experiences and beliefs, mostly misguided beliefs. I know she really believes what she writes, I hope others can see that it isn't always right. I think her writing should have been in a drama review, not a law review. It's bad she doesn't admit to the rascism she has towards others."
2,barbie airplane not durable,"The wings and tail fin of the airplane come off almost as easy as if brushed with a feather. There are too many accessories that are not at all useful (ice cubes, eating utensils) and are hard to keep track of. I am not at all satisfied with the quality of this product"
3,It's stupid but she plays with it!,"My mother bought this for my daughter last Christmas (She was 5 then) I was not thrilled when I saw the millions of little pieces. (Down to extremely tiny ice cubes no less) Yes, my back wings never stay on. Yes the seats tend to fall apart sometimes. And the whole thing doesn't always close very well. But ya know it's a year later and she still takes that dumb thing out at least 2x a week. Sets up the coke cans in the tray; puts the Barbies in the chairs. Makes ice. Her most favorite part though is that stupid microphone and button for the take-off noises. She LOVES to play stewardess and pilot on the ""intercom"" It doesn't stack up to what I thought it would but she loves it. Faults and all."
1,""" the big disappointment""","All I have to say is WHAT A PIECE OF JUNK. This was the worst [money] I ever spent.Why did they even bother to supply wings with this toy? they have yet to stay on for more than ten seconds.When my daughter tries to roll it along the floor the door keeps popping open.there are too many pieces inside the airplane unattached, the child gets very frustrated trying to put everything where its supposed to go, and it's not easy! This one gets a big thumbs down from me and all the kids that have played with it ."
5,Barbie Airplane's Rating Flies High!,"What a wonderful, educational and entertaining toy! It has so many elements of interest: from the real microphone down to actual take-off and landing sounds! Our 6-year old daughter loves role playing with her Barbies and flying to make-believe places! My husband--who is an airline pilot--also agrees that this is great toy for children to learn and explore while using their imagination. It is also a terrific toy for children to play either alone or in a group environment, and both boys and girls seem to enjoy this delightful toy."
3,NOT THE BEST FOR YOUR MONEY,"I bought this toy for my 4 year old after flying back from a trip. It looked great on the package, but as others have stated it does not hold up real well. My daughter still plays with this, but beware of very very tiny pieces - ones that the vacuum will suck up and you will never see again. The pieces are really way to small for younger kids to handle. The wings on mine fall off just like others have stated. The airplane could of been made bigger to allow more room inside for the kids to play with all the items. It is to hard to use the ice, coffee, and other storage areas while you have 3 barbies sitting in the chairs. I would still buy this again, but only because this was the one and only thing she asked me to bring back to her and she still does play with it. But for the money unless your child is begging for an airplane I would find something a little more durable"
3,Barbie Airplane,"Cute toy, but not very durable for the price. Just about all the pieces have fallen out of the airplane, and can not get them to stay in place very well. My 2 year old son plays with it more than my 6 year old daughter. It now resides in his room."
2,Glad I didn't pay full price,"I bought this for my 4 year old. She had never seen it, but I thought she would love it as she loves anything with Barbie on it. I did buy it second hand. Thank goodness. She played with it a few times before it landed in her closest. She has not once asked to play with it and it has been 6 months at least. The wings fall off and the seatbelts don't work all that great. The little pieces rest somewhere in her room. Maybe for an older girl who can act out scene's with their Barbies."
2,hunk of junk,"My daughter had to have this for her 4th b.d. It falls apart, for instance the wings won't stay on and the door won't stay closed. I wish I hadn't wasted my money on this. I can't believe a toy that cost that much made by Mattel could be such a hunk of junk."
2,eh....,"i had this toy when i was about 5. i was very excited when i got it, but after that, i barely ever played w/ it. then, i lost all the pieces (even the seats). after that, it just sat inside my closet untouched. so, i dont recommend this toy for 4-year-olds and under, cuz its a choking hazard from all the little pieces. if u get this toy, then u should put all the little pieces in plastic bags, and make sure that all the bigger pieces always stay in the plane. it might be actually fun if u do that. so u can still buy it, just be careful w/ all the pieces or u will regret that u did buy it."
1,Do not spend the money!,"This airplane is horribly over priced. The wings never stayed on and we even tried super glue. The small pieces are such a nuisance. I threw the ice cubes away the first day because they kept spilling everywhere. I think they had a neat idea but it is a waiste of time and money. My girls have played with it maybe 5 times in the last year and everytime they spend the whole time yelling for me to come help them with it. There is not enough room for both barbies, let alone getting your hands in there to serve drinks. Parents, stick with furniture and the barbie cars, they are alot less expensive and will give your children alot more hours of enjoyment."
4,Super glue for a super plane,"My 3 1/2 year old daughter loves this plane, but the tiny ice cubes spill , wings fall off etc.,which really detracts from the fun. Imagine serving a passenger and the chair falls back, ice cubes spill out all over etc... I found an easy solution, super glue wings, chair and all ice cubes, while still leaving some items moveable, such as the coke cans and glasses.Having done that the toy is much less frusterating for her and me. I still rate this an overall 4 stars- for its detail and durability."
1,A Piece of Junk,"This was a last minute purchase last year for Christmas for my daughter (4 years old at the time) because she ""had to have it"". I wish I had stuck to my guns and never bought it. All the other comments are so true (wings falling off, seats falling apart and the ice cubes please give me a break), it's nice to know I wasn't the only one thinking those things. I was so disappointed in this product that I emailed Mattel but never heard back from them (wonder why?) which was very discouraging considering what I had paid for it. I wish I had saved the box because that thing would have gone back the second day. Now a year later and she still has not played with it, maybe two times!!!! Please, before buying those ""Have to have"" toys, read the reviews. I know I will!!!!"
3,Barbie Plane,Got this at last minute for christmas as it was on the top of my daughters list. Well was I surprised by the poor quality. The wings are always falling off and then trying to fasten the dolls into the seatbelts is another task in itself. I wish it was like the vinyl one I had as a child. I will say we had one very dissapointed 6 yr olds in our house. Would not get my reccomendation.
3,Mother of 3 daughers,"My girls received this as a gift recently and thought it was great...for about 2 days. Actually, I thought it was pretty cool myself at first. The assembly of the item is easy; however, if you aren't a patient person, the 40 small stickers you have to place on the pieces might get you frazzled a little. The pieces that come with the plane (ie. ice cubes, cups, forks, etc.) are ridiculously small...needless to say, I threw them out as soon as we got them...not because they might eat them, but because I knew they would be lost in our carpet within an hour. Also, the seatbelts and head sets keep falling off when you put a barbie in the seat.Altogether, I think that the idea was great, but Mattel should have thought a little more before making pieces that need tweezers to hold on to."
2,cobra radar detector leaks to other cobre radar detectors,cobra radar detector finds other cobra radars detectors then they go off for no reason like cobra gives false alarms i got the 9940 with gps and it goes off there is no cops in sight it is crapmike
4,A forgotten gem from the 90's!,"Why didn't this band make it further than they did? I believe the other reviewer cleared up this matter. It's the fact they were on the scene at a bad time. But don't let this stop you from getting this awesome album!!!The lead singer seriously sounds like a cross between Bono of U2 and the lead singer of The Cult. The songs at times are poppy, happy, dark, and just straight rock. My favorite has to be ""Vanessa"". It's a crying shame this band didn't go further. I am giving it four stars because there are a few songs that aren't up to par with the others on the album, but overall this is a band that needs revival in music!"
4,the weaknesses are overshadowed by the strengths,"This isn't one of Green On Red's top records, but it is a must-have for your collection. Any weak tracks will be forgiven at this low price! You will find two of the best Green On Red songs of all-time here. They are You Couldn't Get Arrested & the horribly tragic & haunting Good Patient Woman. I've been listening to this release since it came out and I've got to tell you that Good Patient Woman still sends chills down my arm. Hold The Line & The Quarter(Marie Laveau) are the other two real standouts on this disc. This is post-Killer Inside Green On Red, so keep in mind that you are getting Dan Stuart, Chuck Prophet(played with Kelly Willis), & some hired guns. The great songs here are more than enough to carry their weak sisters through. You might very well enjoy This Time Around at full-price, but it's a lock at this price."
5,Very nice!,"This watch dome looks much, much better than pictured. I had one that I kept my Grandfather's pocket watch in for years until the dome got broken. This one looks much better than the one I had before. If you have a pocket watch and you want to display it, I highly recommend this item."
5,Pleasant Surprise,"I was looking for Grunge era albums and happened to come across this. This seems to be be a very nice find. More on the Alternative side than being too Punk. Singing is good. Guitars are edgey enough, but not too heavy. The songs are not too catchy, but took me some time. Nice variety with some rockers and softies. Pretty clever album. It Rocks hard, but yet some commercialness to it, kind of Soundgarden like. Grungy, Alternative style. Some of these obscure 90s bands are neat. Must've been a fun time for music at that time. I get excited when I find albums like this. Oddball-ish bands, but gets expensive as you keep trying new bands and the trial and error. This one actually worked out for the better."
2,I found this to be a dud,"I used to have this album. I bought it when I returned to Philadelphia for my grandfather's funeral, so I guess I really didn't give it a good listen to the first time around. Now from sampling it I am disappointed. I only heard one song from these guys on the radio down here in Florida, and that was ""Believe"". It still has the edge after 16 years, but the rest of the album was a washout. I don't know if an acid trip would've made a difference, or not as I listened to this stone cold sober. ""I'll Stay High"" was pretty good, and there were a couple of others, but it just didn't have the right stuff to be a hit album. I guess with one of the songs being called ""F**K You"" they didn't care."
4,"Good, but not their best","Dig definitely has a great sound, and it comes through on a number of the tracks on this, their first album. However, they tend to have a few REALLY good songs, and then a bunch of others surrounding them (which are okay, but not great). I recommend getting Defenders of the Universe as it has fewer songs that you will want to skip over."
5,item,el item llego en excelente estado y en tiempo y forma.el estado del producto es excelente y no presenta ningún daño
5,"Roll over, Beethoven","I am warning you right now, because I am right, and what I am about to predict will be true. That is why I'm posting my prediction at this fine archival space, where it can be viewed by all ages of the future.In about 300 years from now, the people of the future will not have any interest in Elvis, or the Beatles, or Classical music, or anything that ever achieved #1 status on the charts.In the future, James Brown will be regarded as the greatest musical talent and biggest genious in the history of the world. And this cd will be near the top of his shrine to greatness, along with ""Hell"", ""Sex Machine"", and ""Funky People""."
3,Out of date,"I am the maker of this DVD and have added new material to my presentation which this seller does not have access to. If you want the updated version for the same price; buy the $15 item with the same cover, found in this section. Thank you, Leslie"
4,Worth Memorising...,"As a radiologist,I've rarely seen books that make the understanding of complicated points easier. This is an excellent text for the beginners in chest radiology to get a sense of approach to the problems. Although the classifications such as ""Diffuse Coalescent"" or ""Multifocal Ill Defined Densities"" may have low applicability in clinical practice, I still think that there seems no other way to approach to the enigma. One more problem is the difficulty to collect the knowledge about a spesific disease entity from different chapters as the book is based on differential diagnosis. Anyway, the book is worth memorising so there seems to be no problem. Thanks to Dr. Reed and to people who make our paths clean..."
4,A good addition to your Chest radiology collection,"A very nice systematic approach to chest radiology with good lists of differential diagnosis for many radiographic patterns. Also has some decent questions at the beginning of each chapter. However, the quality of the pictures could definitly be improved as some are very low resolution and make it difficult to find the disease process they are discussing. Should be used as an supplement to another chest radiology book."
1,"This book is ""ESSENTIAL""","Indeed,this book is about the best I've read on the subject thus far and is well balanced. I would have given FIVE stars however one thing perturbed me no end! This book contains the SAME information as THE ESSENTIAL AUSTRALIAN SHEPHERD and is mostly verbatim! The two books have entirely different titles,the author of one is not listed on the cover of the other,the publishers seem to be different and the dates of publication are different. Any reasonably intelligent ,trusting person would assume they were different books! Caveat emptor. I purchased both books,paid twice and about the only difference between them was one was hardcover and one was paperback...oh,and though the content inside was almost exactly the same,the covers were very different for some odd reason. I would search the library next time."
3,OK advice but not precise enough,"You cannot go wrong reading this book but do not expect to go train your Aussie to be a model dog citizen afterwards. There is not enough detail or practical advice on rewarding or motivating your dog, understanding individual temperments, or picking a trainer to work with. Indeed, much of the book reads like a template where the primary difference, besides the photos and breed history, between this book and any other dog-training guide would be the words ""insert breed name here.""If you are interested in owning and training an Aussie, please first review the material at Aussierescue.org. Aussie are clever, playful, and engaging. If you own one, you know what it is like to have your dog watch you and to have an silent furry shadow underfoot."
4,Guiness World Record 150 Cars Destroyed,"With a Titile like that how can you go wrong this was the second film for legandary director,producer,actor and true car guy H.B Toby Haliki his most famous film being the cult classic Gone in 60 Seconds this film while the crashes are incredible and the acting is notisably better I found it lacked something the story was a little had to follow and it laged a little at times but for anybody into cars,action and an all around classic GET THIS MOVIE!"
1,An auto 'Plan 9 from Outer Space',"One star (hey, I'm being generous) for acting, direction, cinematography, editing, art direction, sound recording, writing, costumes, makeup and all those other creative areas that contribute to the magic of the movies. You'll be hard put to find a single redeeming feature in this nonsense. Halicki's other car caper special, 'Gone in 60 Seconds', was pretty dreadful in all the above departments but at least it had a cool forty minute car chase, which, thanks to film editor Warner Leighton, turned out rather well but even he could not do much with 'The Junkman'.There is plenty of chase action but most of it takes place in the safety of the Californian countryside and so loses the visual impact of a city chase with plenty of other vehicles and obstructions. Cars at speed on rural routes just look feeble.If you want chases stick to 60 Seconds and forget 'The Junkman'. BTW, it was originally titled 'Gone in 60 Seconds 2."
3,The Chase,"The best part of this movie is during the chase of the Bricklin. This gull wing flyer is first seen by the Queen Mary in Long Beach. The it is followed in the L.A. river to a cool end of chase, when the Bricklin's doors open and takes a flying leap over the cop cars....really cool!"
4,The Junkman,"Finally, after all these years, I have the complete two-movie set of high speed driving, spectacular crash sequences, and a fairly good story line. Both ""Gone in Sixty Seconds,"" and ""The Junkman,"" rate very high on my scale, and while the movies are set back in the late 70's, they're still good movies. Considering the stuff Hollywood is cranking out today, being able to watch movies from a couple of decades ago is a striking change. If you like old movies with a good deal of action, then both of these movies should be considered for purchase."
4,Junkman Review,"While the Junkman was not as spectacular as his original gone in 60 seconds, it is still a great movie. H.B. Halicki always pushed the edge to give us a thrilling movie with a lot of action and spectacular crashes. It is sad to know that he was not able to take advantage of the special effects we have today. If he were able to make a movie today with his imagination it would be incredible. We sadly miss him."
5,Junkman H.B. Halicki,"I give the movie five stars for effort. The plot is thinner than pond scum, but the fact that, like the original ""Gone In 60 Seconds"", Toby Halicki was an amateur film maker and, for the most part the actors were either amateurs or unknowns(then) it really comes off great. The stunts are absolutely fantastic for a low budget movie. I was hooked after seeing the original ""Gone In 60 Seconds"" and just had to see the other Halicki originals. The remake is, at best a three star, considering it was made by pros with a big budget. Yes, I digressed and evaluated them all together, but, how can you separate them... .I highly recommend them all for the action movie car freaks like me."
5,Beautiful and Comfortable Sheets,"The service was great. I got my sheets in no time and in great condition. I ordered 2 sheet sets: gold and blue and when I opened the box, and laid them on my bed, they looked absolutely beautiful. Great colours and great quality. I will buy them again from this vendor."
1,Cardboard Would Be Better,"Yes, the color is beautiful and rich. And yes, they wash well. But these are going into the trash because they are about as soft as cardboard. Some say they feel crisp -- I'd say stiff and scratchy. It's hard to believe that these have such a high thread count. I've tried everything: Softening sheets, liquid softener, plastic softener balls in the dryer. Forget it. I'm buying something else. This product may look good, but you won't, after a sleepless night on these terrible sheets."
1,Very Disappointing,Pictured product looked soft and silky. Quite the opposite. Very stiff for over 400 thread count. Every time I turned over I would hear them crinkle. Took them off the bed after one night. Very disappointing.
2,"Pretty to look at, scratchy to sleep in",The deal seemed too good to be true. It was. I've washed these sheets about 8 times and they're still not soft. They're stiff and scratchy. Not a recommended buy unless you have the time to wash the suckers into softness.
4,sateen sheets,"great deep fitted sheet for oversize mattresses (pillow-top, featherbed, etc). excellent fit, quality, and price"
3,"The sheets live up to their image, but not their thread count...","...While the sheets look beautiful in the online picture and the images certainly hold true, they are about as soft as gas station restroom paper towels. I imagine they will loosen up after a few washes and maybe some fabric softener, but, given the appearance, I thought they would feel a little better. Although, once I'm asleep, it doesn't really matter."
5,Great price and an excellent product,"When I ordered these sheets, I had considered purchasing a different set, but went with this one because it had a great thread count and better price. The pockets on the fitted sheet are deep enough to accommodate thicker mattresses and toppers and the top sheet is larger than most other queen size flat sheets I've purchased in the past. All in all, a great price and an excellent product."
2,Okay sheets.,These sheets come in pretty colors and look nice on the bed but they are still rough even after many washings.
2,run in bottom sheet,The bottom sheet came with a 5 inch run in it. Not worth the time and postage to return for a replacement. Being 440 count I was expecting better quality.
4,wonderful fabric,The sheets are very nice to sleep between. The only problem was all the wrinkles after washing.
1,"Ordered King, received Cal King","I ordered King size sheets and received a package with a King size sticker on top of a Cal King sticker. Guess what: it contained Cal King size sheets. Annoying!Obviously I haven't slept on them yet since they don't fit my bed. They're not the softest sheets I've ever felt. Color is nice, though. Hopefully they'll get the size right next time."
1,Pinson sheets,"Pinzon Italian Cotton Percale Full Sheet Set, IvoryPinzon 400-Thread-Count 100% Egyptian Cotton Hemstitch Queen Sheet Set, SandThe sheets I recently purchased were so rough it is impossible to use them, I have used a bottle of softener on them with no success, very disappointed."
3,BEAUTIFUL SHEETS BUT....,"I picked out these sheets as a gift from my brother - they are BEAUTIFUL SHEETS but....they're still sort of scratchy, so I'm washing them several more times. I had read the previews but still liked the color of these sheets. I'm sure I'll be happy with them once they soften up. Thanks."
4,"Nice, except...","They were almost what you could call rough the first couple of nights, but they seem to have broken in nicely. They breath well in the summer heat (which is what I really wanted). Honestly my only complaint is that they seem to attract cat hair and lint like NOTHING ELSE. It's annoying to have to lint-roll your pillow every night before you go to bed.. that's the only reason it didn't get 5 stars."
2,Scratchy--doesn't feel like 440 thread count!,"These sheets are more scratchy than other 440 thread count sheets I have had. These sheets feel more like 200 thread count. Even after washing, the sheets are still rough. I ordered the color Saddle, and it is a few shades darker than what appears in the picture."
2,very stiff for 440 thread count,"I was hoping for a soft feel, these are not. First washing sheets were very wrinkled, once on bed wrinkles were gone. But we have sheets that are 200 count that are much softer than these. Do yourself a favor and do not buy the sheets. They do look good, but to me the most important thing is how do they feel."
5,Quality basic sheets,"There are basic high quality sheets. They are not extra soft million thread count, but they are basic all cotton sheets that will get the job done and stand up well to years of use. The color seems to be pretty deep and did not fade after a few washes."
2,"Well, they're sheets...","Pros: Rich color, fits thick mattress very wellCons: I can exfoliate with them.When I opened the package, I liked the look of them. I wanted so much to like the product. But after washing them and putting them on my bed, I realized they were not for me. The first I noticed the roughness was when I put my face on my pillow. If I were trying to exfoliate, they would be wonderful! But I was trying to sleep and for that they were a pain. I had to wear pajamas and sleep on a pillow that was not covered with a pillowcase from this set to make it work for me.Perhaps I am spoiled but I like good, soft sheets. I don't expect the world but for $64 I expect much better. I am disappointed and would not purchase these sheets or any other sheets from this brand again."
3,Price Gouging,"I have FOTR Complete Recordings, love it. Would love to have The Two Towers but these shameful greedy sellers charge too much. Do not pay these rediculous asking prices. Hold out for a more reasonable price. This item should not sell for more than $75 brand new. $200 new is price gouging!"
5,The Best Complete Soundtrack!!,"If you liked the 1 CD soundtrack made by Howard Shore, this 3CDs + 1 DVD (with full score in Dolby 5.1) will translate you to the Middle Earth and let you live the Ent's March, The Wolves of Isengard's Attack, The Helm's Deep Battle and Aragorn's past as he faces his Dunedain nature, with no cuts and with all the exact parts of the film's soundtrack.Is like watching the film in audio (but without SFX!! XD)...You won't regret!"
5,The Ultimate TTT Soundtrack,"If you're a fan of The Lord of the Rings, you're going to want to pick this up, and go to the product's website (just search yahoo for ""Lord of the Rings complete recordings"") and download the free liner notes, which are like a 50 page pdf document that has a track by track analysis, photos, a listing of the instruments, lyrics, and a ton of other information. Best yet, the liner notes are free! (In fact, if you're an LOTR fan you're going to want to download this whether you buy this or not.) Also, be sure to pick upThe Lord of the Filmsto complete your collection.As for the Complete Recordings collection, it includes more than just highlights, more than just the music from the theatrical cut, and more than just the music from the extended editions: it includes all that plus unused concepts that were edited out of the picture. It's the ultimate collection!"
4,For the serious LOTR connoisseur,"For starters, the packaging of this collection is brilliant. The accompaning companion book is also an incredible read. Alas, the music itself, while good overall, is somewhat repetitive, and although it sounds great while watching the movie, it is not so, when listened to without it. The previously released soundtracks contain the edited versions and are more pleasing to listen to."
3,Bello ma...,"Io amo l'opera di Tolkien, di Jackson e Shore ma devo dire che a differenza del primo e probabilmente del terzo cofanetto (che ho amato alla follia), la musica delle 2 torri non ha molto senso se slegata dalle immagini cinematografiche. Indubbiamente è un'opera d'arte ma non penso che lo ascolterò tanto a differenza degli altri. La registrazione mi sembra un pò bassa come già nel primo."
5,Pocket Scots Dictionary,"After five trips to Scotland, I decided I wanted to understand some of the Scots language I was hearing on the streets in Glasgow. Scots is a form of English and varies from location to location. It is not Gaelic although it was partially influenced by Gaelic. I found this dictionary to contain most of the words I wanted to look up along with another Scots/English dictionary, but Glaswegian is a complex slang which is spoken fast and may contain words used within families and neighborhoods. A better book would involve a dictionary of the Glasgow Patter and there are several being published."
4,Zoo Book,"Nice pictures, but the text is a little funky. Would also like to see more animals included."
2,Disappointing follow up from Zero 7,"Zero 7 are my favourite artists of all time, so I decided to start listening to the individual artists, such as Sophie Barker, Sia Furler and Tina Dico. Sophie was the one who sang 'In Time' and 'Destiny' among others. These are two of my favourite songs by Zero 7.However, I am extremely disappointed by Sophie's solo CD. It's not the same style or sound, it has no songs that I would pick out as a really good piece of music, and her voice doesn't sound nearly half as impressive as it did in the Zero 7 songs.Overall I regret buying this CD and would tell people to forget Sophie and stick to Tina Dico and Sia - both their individual albums are good, and show that they work well both alone and in a group.Earthbound is a good title only because that's what the music is like, very earthy and almost like she's been living in the woods all her life trying to be like a fairy or something.Yeah... I just don't like it."
2,totally disappointed,"This really is a disappointment. I am a HUGE Zero 7 fan ... and their featured vocalists, however this just didn't cut it. Sophie has a wonderful voice and is a wonderful vocalist but I do not recommend adding this CD as part of your collection."
5,Great author!,"I have read two of this author's books and they are very well written. I am excited to look for more books by this author, his books leave me with a desire to seek out more of his captivating stories. I like the way he can tell more than one story in this book and have them all fall together masterfully.This author was born in London in 1899 and died in Australia in 1960. He was an aeronautical engineer. He served in both WWI and WWII. He left the Navy as a Lieutenant Commander.In 1948 he became disillusioned with the UK and moved his family to Australia. In the 50's and 60's he was one of the world's best-selling novelist."
4,One of Nevil Shute's best,"Nevil Shute is best known for ""On the Beach,"" his novelabout nuclear war, and, more recently, ""A Town Like Alice,""which was made into a TV miniseries. At least half a dozen of his other novels are equally wonderful. My paperback copy of ""The Chequer Board"" is worn out from reading, rereading, and lending, and it is time for me to replace it with a hardback. His account of relations between black American soldiers and the English during World War II is particularly touching, and is a bit of history that was unfamiliar to me."
3,Just OK,"While this book is much better than some Harry Potter books out there, because the articles are scholarly and well-informed, I didn't like it. Most of the articles are written from a sociological or ""cultural studies"" perspective. If you like that kind of thing, then you will like this volume. If you like psychological, allegorical or symbolic readings, then its not the right book for you. Most of the essays are on broad issues and don't go into the books in great detail. I found the academic scholarship to be very repetitive and predictable at times, with many people expounding the same ideas of what ""postmodern"" is. But some essays in it are great (Peter Appelbaum's for instance) and its worth getting, if you know what to expect."
2,Quite good,"I bought it for ""I will survive"" and ... I like just that.Anyway, the sound quality is good."
1,Don't waste your money,"I would have bought this anyway, just because I collect all Yzerman things. That's the only reason.I was extremely disappointed. It's obviously just a compilation of everything he could find that had already been used. I don't think I saw anything in the book that I didn't already know. The kids he talks about in the book are ones 'like' the children Yzerman visited. It's pretty obvious the guys never actually spoke to Yzerman or the kids he visited. The only pic of Yzerman that I can recall is a small black and white that I've seen several times before. I think he was just trying to use Yzerman's name to sell his book.I would recommend any other Yzerman book over this one.I prefer 'Heart of a Champion' myself."
3,Good overview of modern Ireland,"I think some of the Irish protest too much! As a South African working in Ireland I found the book a good source of information about Ireland, and especially the recent history of the country. It also confirmed a lot of things I had noticed myself, for instance that the Irish are lacking in a sense of tidiness. I have to agree, though, that it is not very engaging. I also found the author's use of conversations with normal people as evidence of trends or widely held views excessive and, at times, irritating.Also, the book probably needs to be updated to take the effect of the Celtic Tiger on the Irish way of living into account. The country seems to be in the grip of materialism. The author also glosses over the issue of alcohol abuse. It seems to be a very real problem among students and young working people, but most Irish seem to view it as charming and part of their culture."
2,"Abandon your heritage, Ardagh tells Irish","As with other books of the Ardagh series on Europe, this book is useful to all those who are totally ignorant about Ireland. However, Ardagh's prescritions for Ireland and its future are all modernistic. Basically, he hopes Ireland will abandon its cultural past and join the grim narcissistic future that is in store for the rest of the modern world. Traditions are to be gladly abandoned. After reading three of Ardagh's series now, I am sure he is not a good man. His future world is a vulgar, crass, materialistic one in which a New Class and theuraputic state takes care of the citizen's needs and desires. I am sure he is a fan of the Clintons and the Blairs and Ireland's Mrs. Robinson."
2,"Reject Catholicism and heritage, Ardagh tells Irish","Though the book is a somewhat useful read, Ardagh does not like much of the Irish past especially Ireland's social conservatism. He seems to say that Ireland's future can be bright if the Irish only reject their past. Since the publishing of this book, Ireland has lept into the future by electing Bertie Aherne Prime Minister. Mr. Aherne has dumped his first wife and family and openly lives with a girlfriend. Mr. Ardagh must be grinning from ear to ear."
1,An insult to the Irish,This book is nothing more than an insult to the Irish people. It paints terrible steroeotypes and does nothing else but put down all this Irish. This book should be burned.
2,Not what I thought...,This is not a tab book. It has only standard music and a few guitar chords. Not the sellers fault though. I must've overlooked it. Fast shipping!
1,waste of time,Didn't like it. No my cup of tea. Scenes were covered or blocked. It was actually boring. Wouldn't give more than one star.
2,Don't waste your Money,"The Dragon is a excellent counterattacking opening for Black to include in his/her repertoire. However, by focusing EXCLUSIVELY on thematic elements of the Dragon and not including any theory, this book will leave Black players at a disadvantage against opponents who know their opening theory. I strongly recommend Winning with the Sicilian Dragon 2 by Chris Ward because it includes a nice mix of thematic elements along with the theory that is necessary to know when one is playing the Dragon. All in all, a good general overview, but a waste of money."
5,Secrets of the Sicilian Dragon,This book was very helpful to my research of the sicilian dragon. I felt that it covered every point with enough detail so that I understood it all carefully and knew why things were being executed in the manner they were. I am so encouraged by this book that I am going to purchase another copy for a close relative of mine. I would recommend this excellent book to anyone who feels like knowing anything about the sicilian dragon.
3,Just as a complement,"This book show you positions, ideas and some games. No lines, no variants. If you want to study lines get another book."
3,List of tactical tricks for speed chess...,"I bought this book because of one of my constant opponents played the Dragon exclusively (only recently he began to increase his repetoire with Najdorf and other Sicilian.) Overall he got a plus score on me. I also read some games of Fischer beating the Dragon (I feel good), then Sierawan poked fun of the Dragon (feel better), and Karpov killed Korchnoi's Dragon (feel the best). Then Kasparov is successful with the Dragon. Now I have mixed feelings about the Dragon (together with bad experience in the Dragon, I lost many games with either color!!!). I hoped to find a book to improve my score, And this book is not a long term work. It could provide a list of plans to use when you play white or black, but not deep analysis, only good for quick fix when playing speed chess. Buy book from GM writers is better choice, they have their record to back it up. 7.50 USD is OK for this book."
4,A great sequel to the original Chrono Trigger,"Chrono Cross is an excellent sequel to the original SNES game ""Chrono Trigger"". However, you don't necessarily have to have played it to understand the plot of this game, but certain parts will be a little fuzzy.The plot flows nicely, and the graphics are very nice. The battle system is a little confusing at first, but it doesn't take very long to get the hang of. With over 30 playable characters, the game is a lot of fun to play a second or third time through."
4,some tricky parts,"I had some trouble with the shifting between worlds, but other than that, the game was wonderful. The graphics were excellent for a PSX game, and the storyline was detailed and interesting."
5,"Chrono Cross may not have had the largest budget, but it has the largest heart.","Graphically, Chrono Cross is nothing short of stunning. While Square's Final Fantasy is glossy and polished, Chrono Cross has an organic feel lacking in the former's ""perfect"" environments. Vibrant color, creative design, and just the right amount of ambient effects bring the settings to life. Again, while Final Fantasy drops your characters into a small subsection of a large, epic environment, Chrono Cross lets you explore every nook and cranny of scandalously detailed towns, buildings, and dungeons. While we don't intend to slight Final Fantasy's excellent graphics and design, many gamers will prefer the more down-to-earth, personal, and ""gritty"" feel of Chrono Cross. The environments are well worn and lived in, not just-constructed movie sets."
4,Chrono Cross Greatest Hits,"Amazon sells The Greatest Hits version of Chrono Cross. The picture on this site is fake. I was misleaded by the picture and bought ""The Greatest Hits"" version instead. Amazon said they will ""correct the problem with the picture showed."" Don't buy directly from Amazon.All copies that Amazon sells are The Greatest Hits version. This version freezes near the end of Disc 1. I warn all of you not to buy from Amazon. They've acknowledged that many people returned their copies because of this.This review was written on June 6, 2007."
5,My son 12 year old loves this game,"I guess this is an older game, but my son says it is hard t find good RPG games anymore. He really likes this one and says that it is fun and difficult enough to keep him intrigued. He plays this game on the playstation 2. I am a dope and forgot to buy the memory card for this game. I guess it needs a memory card for the PS1 not the ps2 memory card we already have. ah well... live and learn."
3,A game with great potential,"I was so excited to finally get my copy of Chrono Cross. The opening scene was better then ffviii! The graphics was better too! Ahhh and the beautiful music I couldn't get enough of. Then I got my first battle. The battle system is slow and rather frustrating. It was a major let down. And then after that, I got more of the story. The story is a great concept, but you just can't get to know the characters. One doesn't give a darn about the main charecter, weather he lives or dies, who cares. The only moment I did care about with any charecter is Kid. Kid seems to have more depth then any other character on any other RPG I've played. Without her, its really not worth playing unless you are doing something to help her out. Its worth buying if all your looking for is some amazing graphics and some excellent music. Other wise, just rent it."
5,i like this game,when i first bought it i got it confused with legend of dragoon because i did not now the name of the game at that time and after i bought it i started to like the game and im still playing the game after beaten it so many times
2,Can you say boring?,This game had decent graphics and sound. It had an okay battle system. So it would be a decent game if it actually had a PLOT. What story there was in this game was incredibly hard to follow partially due to the fact that there were about a zillion playable charcters none of whom had personalities. This is one of the most boring RPG's that I have ever played!
3,Way over rated.,"this game had two huge flaws to be great. One was that the battle system just plain sucked. It really wasent enjoyible. Two, the story was way to confusing. If it wasnt for these 2 things it would have been a great game."
1,Very Good Game But One Problem,"I love this game and think it is one of the greatest games of all time. That is why I recently purchased it from Amazon (or Hitgaming, but through Amazon). The game is great, but there is just one problem: the game freezes! At this one cutscene the game freezes and you cannot play it anymore. So, I called the customer support people at Square Enix and he said (God's honest truth) that there is a problem with the Chrono Cross games that Amazon sells. Also, for some reason the game freezes on a Playstation One and Two, but not a Playstation Three. Anyways, I mailed the game to Square Enix and they are gonna replace it with a working copy. So in conclusion, be warned! Do not buy this game from Amazon or you will have to pay for shipping and handling both to and from for a replacement."
3,dont get the used one,I bought the used one and i regret it because once you get top the second disc it stops working my PLAYSTATION stops reading itso if you get it you can take your chances at buying the used one but if you don't want to take the chance get the new onebut that could just be my PLAYSTATIONit's an ok buy
5,best ps1 rpg game ever,chrono cross is awesome a classic the best of the best buy this game if you want a really good rpg you wont be sorry
5,This game rocks,"Chrono Cross is one of the best games I have ever played it has great graphics, great movies, and excellent game play this is definitely a game to buy. I don't think it should be called a sequel it is nothing like a sequel it is way different than Chrono Trigger."
4,best rpg Square has made,This in my opinion is the best game that Square Soft has made to date and possibly one of the best games to have ever been made. The game play is incredible graphics are incredible and the story is awesome. Another thing the more times that you play the more different endings you can get. Let me break it down in terms of overall gameplay.Grqaphics 10/10Replay value 10/10Sound 10/10Gameplay 10/10Bottom line this is one hell of a game I think it is proably better than any game to date. Buy it.
4,Like Woah,"If you've played Chrono Trigger, then you know what to expect...however, this game has a more complex storyline, 44 characters, and amazing graphics...even though, it's somewhat easy if you've played through CT and the Final Fantasy series, it's worth buying...enjoy..."
2,its ok but....,I was disappointed in this game. I was so hoping that it would in fact be similar to the first Chrono. In my opinion the first one is better
5,BEST SEQUEL EVER FOR A VIDEO GAME,I cannot contain my undying love for this game! I've played it over and over again. So many different possible endings :DOne of my favorite classics from S.S. <3333
3,a lackluster sequel,"this game really IS an OK game... but only OK. Square could have put a little more effort into this one, but they didn't. and it ended up being not so great. it pales in comparison to its predecessor, despite the more advanced technology used to make it. the soundtrack, however, is top-notch. grab a copy of it if you can."
3,A Fair Game with Major Shortcomings,"Ah, Chrono Cross... for Chrono Trigger fans such as myself, it was the most anticipated game in late 2000. Unfortunately, those looking for a sequel to CT will be disappointed to find a game in the same world with common themes, as opposed to a true sequel. Technically, the game pushes the PSX to its absolute limits, and Mitsuda's music is incredible (of course). I would recommend this game, but don't expect Chrono Trigger II."
3,"Decent game, but its not the best","Ok, for one, this for the love of god needs to not be billed as a sequel. You go into this game after playing the masterpiece that is Chrono Trigger and you are so let down, you never get to see the world of CT, EVER. And you really dont ever get to see the characters or the major story tie in til the last 5 minutes before the end boss. There were too many characters, and the story got lagged during the sidequests. With that said, this game has a great gameplay, wonderful soundtrack and decent story IF YOU DONT THINK OF IT AS A SEQUEL! I was disappointed by it as I loved CT and had high expectations for this game."
5,Breathing taking excitment until the end!?,When I began playing this game I got off to a slow start.But after a while I picked it up and moved through the game in no time. The graphics to this game are amazing. Well actually amazing doesn't describe them! The graphics are overwheelmingly beautiful! Stunning! The game play is awsome! I love to plot to the game..the only downer is(has nothing to do with the game but the actually playstation system!) it tends to run very slow during a certain scene .. when Kidd...and Lynx..and Serge...er..I wont spoil it..anyways other then that! Its GREAT! BUY THIS GAME PEOPLE!
5,"AWESOME, KICKS ..., NOTHING BAD ABOUT IT","The title of this review pretty much says it all but wow this game blows me away. I'm a serious gamer and love a good RPG but i honestly think this is one of, if not the best ive ever played! I just can't help it. Yes i mean better than even FFVII!! good story line, cool characters (except solt and peppor) who always say ""lets shake it outta here"" when you beat them in battle. But besides that the battle mode is so good and with so many mysteries and things you dont find out till later its just great. OK enough from me i think u guys get the idea..."
5,Very Impressive!,"I am currently playing this game and am a little over halfway through, I think. I've really enjoyed it so far - the graphics are nice, though you'd better have a decent-sized TV with good resolution to read the small text on the menu screen. Most RPGs have predictable storylines, but I was actually surprised by the events that unfolded midway through this game. Once you get the hang of handling all the different Elements, the fights really get interesting. I like the fact that you can use the ""Run Away"" option if you're getting the crap beaten out of you to back out of a battle, reorganize your elements or equipment, then jump back into the battle. Overall, a very good RPG. Can't wait to see how it ends."
3,"Great story line,but...","I loved Chrono Trigger, so I couldn't wait for Chrono Cross to come out. The graphics are great and the story line is unique (can't go into detail without giving it away). However, I was HIGHLY disappointed with the endings. They could've been more creative. Not to mention they could've had developed the characters better."
3,Chrono Cross is good but...,The plot is very complicated! Some say that it is deeper in content than Chrono Trigger. But that doesn't make it better. It starts off good in the beginning but you can quickly lose interest if you're not engrossed with it by the middle point of the game. The battle system starts out fun but it becomes later complicated and it has many limits on it that you soon find out half-way into the game. It seemed as if the complicated elements of the game was later added to try to achieve a better experience than its predecessors. But unfortunately the efforts failed in its task. By the end of the game I became so bored that I turned off the game and cleaned my room and became more satisfied with that than trying to beat CC. I highly recommend getting Chrono Trigger(which is available for PSOne on Final Fantasy Chronicles).I don't recommend Chrono Cross but it would be okay to rent Chrono Cross and check it out.
4,chrono cross,For a PS 1 game the graphics are outstanding and there's a pretty good challenge to the game.
4,Chrono Cross- A Great Game,"Chrono Cross is a must play ps1 RPG with a great storyline and gameplay. The only bad thing I could say about this game is that it's relatively short for a standard RPG, but it is still worth the experience even if it was but a short one."
5,Very nice flow,"The best word I can use to describe this game is ""organic."" From characters and plot-lines to combat and spells, the whole thing feels like you're making it up as you go along. I've played with and without the tip-book and in both cases you really feel like you're a part of the story. The spells are gorgeous, the scenery is lush and interesting.The only problem, and it's hardly a problem, is the depth of your fighting party. I simply did not have time to test out and perfect every character, even after playing through the game three times. I love the little turnip, though, he's brutal if you let him be."
5,A new spin for Chrono's sequel,"Chrono Cross delevers a new versions for sequels. You need not be familiar with Chrono Trigger, but this is my favorite aspect of the game. A veteran player will recognize names, places, and other characters from the previous game. Although the names are the same, they are matched differently. One must keep a keen eye for these changes. Otherwise this game completely fulfills a true RPG's addiction for games. It may seem rather elementary at first, but plot twists and foreshadowing highlight some of the best parts. Consider it a must"
5,Good Game!,"I bought this game for my cousins, and since it arrive they haven't stop playing the game. They love it!!"
2,"Great, but cannot get past disc 1!","Chrono Cross starts off much like its predecessor, with the protagonist Serge living a carefree life in his home village. However, adventure comes his way, and Serge is whisked off into a tale of adventure. The game takes a while to pick up, but when it does, you will be engrossed in it. The music is brilliantly coordinated with the story of the game, and the presentation assures this as a worthy sequel to Chrono Trigger.There is one problem...The game freezes!The disc freezes during a cutscene towards the end of disc 1. Apparently, it's a widespread problem with Greatest Hits copies of Chrono Cross. This doesn't come up until well past 30 hours in the game, so it is hard to test for it. Keep this in mind when buying Chrono Cross."
1,The Reasons Not To Buy This Game,"I don't know what basement the people writing the positive reviews about this game come from,but in my perspective it was not worth the $10 dollars I payed to buy it off Playstation Network.Storyline: The plot was slow to develop and even after beating the game I found it lacking.Leveling: Your level is based off a ""Growth"" system meaning you will have nearlyidentical stats at identical spots throughout the game on multiple playthroughs (which i didn't bother doing).Graphics: Just your average playstation visuals.Music: I must admit the music was well done, that's what gives the game it's 1 star.Characters: At first the idea of 44 or 45 characters sounded fun, until you realize that as a result of the vastamount of characters, the ""character development"" suffers.My Recommendation is that people wanting to buy an old school RPG instead buyLEGEND OF DRAGOON (which hit Playstation Network May 1, 2012 for the low price of $5.99)"
1,Not NIB,"I just wanted to put a review up here for all of you collectors to see. These ARE NOT factory sealed games. Not even the original release that's pictured - they're the ""Greatest Hits"" version.. They're repackaged. Collectible value destroyed. Fair price for the game. I'm sure they play ok - they're in good shape. But Don't do like I did and buy a whole stack of them thinking it's a listing by someone who has no idea what they have.Just buy these to play. Not to collect."
1,What happened squaresoft?,"I'm not sure which came out first, but after seeing all the good reviews for this, and the fact that I liked FF7, This looked like a good buy. Ok, it has a decent combat system. Ok, it has good graphics. This plot makes no sence! After the begining, I have no idea why the characters are doing what they are, execpt that they are forcing the game to go a certian way."
1,week,"this game looks good, and the story is great but the game does not deliver the goods. The problem I have most with the game is serge the main character never talks, that is just plain lazyness you just get the feeling that serge is just lifeless and is not intristing at all. Since the game has so many characters in it, it seems that most of the other characters as lifeless as serge and have no pointe in ever bieng introduced to the plot.I feel thair is a limit to the number of characters in a game that will still make the game intristing. And I am sorry Game Informer, but this game does not restore my faith in the modern RPG(you have to read thair great magazine to know what I am talking about) Square could do better, I have seen it done."
5,Outstanding RPG!,"WOW! While I'm a relative newcomer to RPGs on console systems, I have to say: Chrono Cross ROCKS! The visual feast of color and light is stunning, while the music by Yasunori Mitsuda is outstanding - nay, spectacular. The battle system using elements is a fresh take on combat in a RPG. Yes, the early battles are a bit easy, but the challenges start soon enough. This game is a well-recommended investment in entertainment gaming. Go Kid! Go Serge!"
2,A good yarn for juvenile readers,"Children of all ages who love yarns about the French Foreign Legion ought to try the granddaddy of all such books, UNDER TWO FLAGS, a classic 1867 adventure novel by ""Ouida"", pseudonym of the English novelist Marie-Louise de la Ram&#65533;e, 1839-1908.ISBN: 0192823280"
5,Grand adventure!,"What a grand adventure this is! Heroes don't get any more noble, courageous, resourceful, and staunch than the Geste bros. Chock-full of feats of derring-do in exotic locations and intensely satisfying in a Victorian, Boys Life, silent-film kind of way.I can completely understand how good British boys bred on literature like this would grow up yearning for military glory and the chance to expand the glorious British Empire to the most dismal and dangerous corners of the world, concerned only that - when their time was up and they eventually did ""pop off"" (an aphorism favored by the Geste bros, by the way) - they would do so with their jaws nobly clenched and brave witticisms fading on their dying lips.A little long in places but fun, fun, fun!"
5,Beau Gest,"A great book from the 1920s in good condition, given its age, and delivered in a very timely manner at a very reasonable price."
4,Just as good as I remembered,"I read a Reader's Digest condensed version of Beau Geste when I was a child and it really made an impression on me. Many (many) years later, I was happy to discover that the full-length book was just as enjoyable to me as an adult as it had been when I was a child. It's a great, swash-buckling story with good characterization and witty dialog. It reminded me of Dumas's The Three Muskateers."
2,Unprofessional formatting,Length:: 1:23 MinsI did a video review for this particular copy of Beau Geste (sold by Amazon itself I think) because I wanted to show how weird and unprofessional the font looked. Like someone who didn't have word processor skills tried to format the book and then printed it in their basement. I loved this book when I first read it and was excited to find a copy. I said I was going to keep it in the review just to have the story but I think I would almost rather not have it. Very disappointing. Sorry for the abrupt ending in the video.
3,"A-Plus for plot, but F for readability","Since first reading Beau Geste 20 years ago it has remained simultaneously the single most memorable and disappointing novel I have read. The plot is stunningly unforgettable, but the storytelling is clumsy and some characters, like the Americans, are so cliched they almost made me laugh."
3,"Too ridiculous for words, but fun nonetheless.","The story is ridiculous, but fun to read. The quality of Wren's writing varies, though. It starts out superbly and remains good through most of the book. However, there is a slightly drawn-out denouement which looked to me as though Wren had become tired of the book but didn't quite know when to stop writing. As a result, the last 50 or so pages are not told nearly as well as the main body of the book, which left me slightly disappointed at the end."
2,"Geneology, not Civil War history",If you are interested in Civil War history I would recommend that you leave this book on the shelf. However if you have a family member who served in the regiment then it might be a nice keepsake. Less than 40 pages are devoted to the history of the regiment and you would be just as well off to read the regiment's reports in the Official Record. Most of the pages are filled with the names of roster of the regiment.There is very little to grab hold of in this book. Even the roster seems to be limited to what was found on the National Archives Compiled Service Records. Overall a real disappointment and not at all what I was expecting.
5,Rave Review,"This album contains some of the best Kool & the Gang Singles. For some reason it's been underrated but singles like Forever, Peacemaker, Holiday and God's Country are among the best this group has ever come up with. These Singles are thought provking and excellent listening pleasure."
3,Not their best but still worth getting,"No one loves K&TG as much as me so trust me this is an album worth getting despite it being nowhere near their best. In my humble opinion the best songs on the album are in this order:Forever(I love ballads especially JT ballads),Stone love,Special way, Broadway,and God's Country. The remaining songs including (would you believe it)''Victory'', are just above average. But all in all, if you love K&TG especially if you love JT's wonderful tenor then I recommend you get this album especially because it's selling for next to nothing."
5,LOVE IT,I love old school music. This CD does not disappoint. The music is great and there are a lot of great songs on this CD.
3,Old School R & B,"The CD is nice, I was disappointed some of the songs were not as long as the original album. Other than that, you can never go wrong with any jams from Con Funk Shun"
1,Religious Propaganda,As explained in the author bio at the front of the book; Stranges is the President of the International Evangelism Crusades (a world-wide Christian Denomination). I personally feel he has used the UFO phenomena as a vehicle to promote his beliefs. I apologize to those who are strong believers but I have reviewed this book based on its lack of substantial truth or developed inquiry into the Valiant Thor story.
4,Pleased,I enjoy searching for used books by Chatani . This book is written in both in English and Japenese. His books are not for beginners and they are always harder to fold than to cut. Not for beginners. The butterfly makes a beautiful card. White Christmas by Masahiro Chatani and Keiko Nakazawa is the book i use the most when making cards. The santa with sleigh is my favorite in the white christmas book. Always use sharp blades when cutting a metal ruler is also helpful A glass cutting board purchased at craft stores also is the best way to get clean cuts.
1,Flashlight,"If you mean to rate the product itself, it is fine. The service, however, was not, although I don't know if Amazon is to blame or the vendor themselves. If you are going to offer NEXT DAY delivery and charge the customer $45 plus then deliver it the next day. I had no idea that the vendor meant that it would be delivered the next day to Amazon and then it would take another day (or in this case two) to reach me from Amazon. Clarification is critical here."
4,Great,It is an excellent documentary about the history of the American Cars except for the 'Oldsmobile' which shows a commercial with no detail info about the History of the car. But it is worth looking at it because it does a good detailed about the rest of the American cars. It is very well documented.
5,The best expression of strong emotions ever put to music.,"This CD deals with several issues that most junior high, high school, college girls face - eating disorders, ""being the seniors"", self-inflicted wounds, wanting to commit suicide, wanting to get the f*ck out of your hometown...but don't get me wrong, it doesnt make you want to do bad things... it helps you realize that you arent the only one who has felt this way, and in that sense, it is great ""therapy"".One of my favorite things about this CD are the lyrics, and unfortunately there is not a lyric sheet included with the CD version. there are sites online that have the lyrics though. The lyrics are really powerful, they cut right to the raw core of feelings.I can't praise this album enough for being so perfect at expressing it's messages, lyrically and musically."
4,Soft Machine Leagacy,"If you know who Soft Machine is and you've liked there past material, you'll like this. This CD set is not a ""greatest hits"", it's most of the origional members playing live. Good stuff."
2,It was a disapointing surprise.,"It was an almost tearful experience to hear this album. We were expecting a compilation of original recordings. Instead, we discovered all our favorite songs had been re-recorded. While Connie remains a vibrant woman with a voice capable of expressing each song, it is not what we wanted.This album should have an indication noting its nature. We still want a CD copy of the original recordings."
2,did not work,I bought this cami for my mom but I had to return it. Was not as expected. The color was perfect though.
4,"Good product, good price","These gloves were purchased for my 8-year-old daughter who takes ice skating lessons. When I bought these gloves I was concerned about the size, but I put them on and the gloves come to my wrist. I normally wear a ladies L or XL."
2,Uograde -- caveat emptor!,"The software works fine, but it was far from clear in the description of the product on-line that it was NOT compatible with the TRIAL VERSION of Microsoft Office that comes with all the new Macs, and which sends the user online to buy an ""upgrade."" One needs to buy a full NEW verison, NOT an upgrade, which I would have been glad to do if that had been clear from the start. Unfortunately, I hade to uninstall the ""upgrade;"" return it for a refund; and order and install the full version before I could get Office 2004 working. A lot of trouble that Microfost could have saved me by being more forthright in their product descriptiopn."
2,Not very impressed so far...,"I've been using Office 2004 for a couple of days now, and so far I've been underwhelmed. Everything feels significantly more sluggish than in Office X, especially Word. Entourage also crashes when I try to open 50% of my HTML-formatted mail. Aside from being able to save longer file names, and the new columns view of Entourage, I hven't found anything that compelling about this upgrade."
4,Almost as good as PC,"I bought this product solely for it's unicode support. Without it I was not able to work easily with foreign text. A+ for that feature. One feature I'm missing, and maybe it's in this version but I haven't found it yet, is in the Windows version you can open a plain text file in pretty much any encoding and save it as another encoding. The Mac version does not do that. Otherwise, this is a great product for producing small documents."
1,Office installation problems,"I have been a mac user for 10 years, and am disappointed with the installation problems office 2004 has presented. Excel, Word, Power Point, all fail to open. I have a G4 mac running a freshly installed 10.3 OS X system with plenty of RAM. Both forms of Office 2004 installation (drag and drop and the auto install feature) have proven ineffective in resolving the issue. It looks like more time on the phone with tech support to resolve this one. Hopefully, they won't want to charge me for calling to figure out why a basic installation of their program has glitched. I will find out on Monday when they open after their early evening closing hours (3pm)!"
4,Microsoft 2004 Mac review,I found that the product was fully functional with adequate updates posted. It works well with PC products.
4,Mac Office Update 2004,I finally made the decision to update and it is easy to install and use the new features. I still wish Microsoft would include Publisher in their package for the Mac like it does for Windows....Maybe their next version will (hope - hint).
3,Never Finished This One,"I'm a major fan of Mr. Sheldon and buy everything he writes. I've read everyone, some are great while others are disappointing ... but this book was too hard to get into. Was not an ""easy"" read like his others, and was difficult to keep track of the storyline...I kept having to read things over and finally said..WHERE IS A STUART WOODS books!"
4,Good if you are already a Sheldon fan,"I found this book a good read, but occasionally a little lost as it moves very quickly and sometimes seems to loose itself. Great if you are already a Sheldon fan, but not so good if you are not used to his work."
3,Confused by the time line in the book,"This book has many stories that twist and turn. Overall, it's a good book from Sidney Sheldon but not one of his best works. I found this book didnt really follow the timeline correctly. Megan was abandoned in 1947, and the stories were happening when she was 28. So that makes the year to be 1975 which is before the Berlin wall collapsed, and many other historic events mentioned in the book happened. Reading this book gives me the impression that the stories took place in the 19th century instead of the modern time. It didn't give me the ""cant put down"" mode that other sheldon books have given me."
3,Pretty good,"I liked this book a lot.Its based on 4 nuns who escape from Cistercian Convent of the Strict Observance and find themselves in the hands of Jamie miro, leader of the outlawed Basque nationalists. Its about how 3 of these nuns fall in love with Jaime Miro and his gang. For what happens at the end, read the book yourself."
4,Good book,"This was a good reading experience. Sheldon had me flipping page after page, and I devoured this book in no time. I loved the flashback style and riviting story line. I thank the author for introducing the readers to the fact/history behind the story. In all, it was great entertainment."
2,Not as good as Denta Clean toothpastes.,"I purchased this item by mistake because I remembered the brand name incorrectly and was in a hurry when I ordered it. I was looking to re-order theDenta Clean Herbal Pet Tooth Pastewhich did a very good job and had a flavor the dogs loved.While our dogs love peanuts and peanut butter, both disliked this toothpaste despite it being peanut flavored. We also found it to be less effective; their teeth were more yellow and they developed bad breath more quickly in the few weeks that we used this product despite using electric toothbrushes with it. (They are used to electric toothbrushes so we know the toothpaste is the problem.)The tube is very small so it only lasted about 3 weeks for 2 dogs with nightly brushing. But I guess that was a good thing because we switched to a more effective product that the dogs like better (Denta Clean Tartar Control Tooth Paste for Dogs.)"
2,Not what I expected,"I like this brand as I have tried it before, but I am not very happy with the fact that it is green...I have been told by my vet not to give my beagles products that have coloring, and I'm not sure why this is green. On the otherhand, both of my beagles like this product."
2,JavaSpaces Example by Example,"At first glance, this appears to be a descent book onJavaSpaces. However, on closer examination, you'll find thebook riddle with errors and with blante omissions in theexample code.But the biggest shortcoming of the book is that there isno link or URL to the source code - and no there's no way tocontact the author either.In short, it's book about examples and but the examples maynot work as written (for instance, the parallel programmingexample at the end doesn't work and SpaceUtil class is a mess.)"
3,OK but not as good as we expected,The curve of the magnifier gives a narrow range for viewing so really only one person can watch the TV and get the full benefit from the magnification.
3,Not really for use with a computer monitor,"Bought this for a person with macular to put in front of his computer monitor. It didn't work for him. Oh well, it was worth a try."
1,Not what I was hoping for,"I was hoping this product would make squinting at my computer unnessary, but the lines in the enlarger caused a weird distortion/glare. I ended up returing it after trying it our for less than 5 minutes, in various positions and distances from the screen. Returning wasn't a huge problem but I had to pay postage and that was a bummer."
3,"TV Screen Enlarger , Fits 15 to 25 inch Diagonal TV","We bought this hoping it could be used for the computer monitor for my Dad with macular degeneration, but did not work out that is the only reason I gave it three stars, it was too big. Sent it back and bought a 27"" monitor for him that did the trick."
5,Hang time by Wayman Tisdale,I heard this on 104.3 in Baltimore and i loved the title song.This is a great cd.
4,smooth all the way.,"With a true calling for the bass it's unbelieveable that Tisdale has ever once played professional Basketball, he knows how to get the party started and keep the interest going and the people dancin'. nuff said.J.J."
5,Renaissance Man,"I'm a little biased.. I'm an OU alumnus and my first college class in 1982 was also Wayman's first. Then he became a god on the hardwood. He's made a ton of money and I collected his basketball cards along the way. I knew he was always serious about music, being active in his father's ministry.. but when I noticed that he was producing albums, I was skeptical. He gets the benefit of the doubt from me... but he doesn't need it! This is a slick, soulful CD that ranks with the top jazz cuts of recent times."
1,Clown shoes,"The tips are way too long, giving an extra 2 inches to my shoe size. It looks and feels awkward and was quickly returned."
3,Ok for the price,"A decent sweater for $10, shipped free? Anytime. Looks decent. Survives machine wash decently (hasn't lost shape yet). The only downside is that the neck size if fairly small compared to the chest size and length. You kind of have to wear the collar up, without closing the zipper."
2,More discoful than soulful,"This is not a bad cd. I gave it the two stars because I feel as though they are cashing in on the popularity of rare grooves comps and Northern soul reissues name to sell you mostly mid 70's up tempo synthesizer funk and dico influenced garbage. As an avid collector of Hi, Stax, Atco, etc, there's a reason I didn't recognize these songs. It wasn't their rarity, it was the fact that these songs didn't hail from the classic sessions that one thinks of when you think of soulful grooves. There are exceptions. The Erma Franklin rendition of ""Light My Fire"" is bananas!! That alone got this cd the two stars. But all in all, if you're into the funk, go for Funky 16 corners or Keb Darge, and if you're lookin for real soul grooves, think Dave Godin or the new comps from Kent. And Please would amazon start making audio clips available for cds costing more than 20 bucks?"
1,Wasn't thrilled,I installed this remote right-hand switch in my layout and the after about a week I could no longer change directions using the remote switch provided. I think one of the coils of the electomagnet shorted out inside. It's not like the switch had continuous duty I may run my layout maybe one to two hours a week. I am looking at retrofitting the coil of an atlas switch to fix the problem.
4,Like going home,"Being from Montana, Cowby Angst realy hit home. The Characters in the book seem like old friends. The reality of life in the west and the struggle with family and friends will relate to many people. I hope there is a seguel."
5,Simply put - a fun read!!,"It could be said that Cowboy Angst deals with alot of the issues facing that 20-something crowd with job, education, parents, parents expections, siblings, relationships and life goals. But it is better to say that it is a fun and entertaining story with a mid-American counter culture twist of a man who tries to always take the path less traveled in the face of his parent, siblings and mid-western conformity. A bit of an On The Road feel for the Gen Xers."
2,Sofware problems,"With less than a month with this product, I already have problems. Don't get it. Hp didn't even send an Operating System disc. I got problems with this product....."
2,HP can blow me,"I come across all laptops in my profession, and lately HP's are just terrible. It really does take FOREVER to boot up, literally between 3 and 4 minutes which seems to plague all HP's nowadays. All HP's that I've seen in the past 6 months do this routinely.The touch-pad completely sucks, Battery-life is about 45 minutes to an hour FOR A NEW BATTERY (you can bet you'll be buying that extra one if you ride airplanes). And granted you only have to do it once, but initial set-up is unusually grueling.I'll never stray from Toshiba again."
4,"Great notebook, wrong size free case","Loving this notebook PC after receiving it 3 days ago.Only change I would have made by custom ordering it would be a RAM upgrade, but that's easy to do aftermarket.(...)Amazon has the best price I found.Hooray for Lance!! and supporting the LAF!The promo free Targus 17"" Citygear L.A. bag is very nice, but way oversize for this notebook. A much better choice would be the Targus citygear NY 15"" model with still some room to spare.But hey, free is free. Still, would be better if it was the right size case in the offer. Check the dimensions."
1,"oh be careful with HP's, their customer service is useless","I bought the Lance Armstrong special edition in September 2005. Couple of months ago, my husband noticed a crack on the outside of the computer, right behind of one of the hinges and immediately called the customer service. India picked up the phone and it took 45 minutes maybe more for them to understand what our problem was with the computer. Although we have a year warranty, this was for some reason not covered. We were upset so they said a technical support person will call and talk to us, which they did but my husband was not home so the tech.support guy left a phone number that is 24/7 busy. We called them again, this time very frustrated and they told us again they were gonna call and that was 3 months ago. So, be careful. We wasted our money!!N.Anderson"
5,I love this Laptop,I ordered this laptop about 1 month ago to use for school. I also ordered a linksys wireless router at the same time. I had no problems whatsoever getting the laptop or the router to work. The laptop is very nice and just the right size for someone on the go.I have used it for downloading pictures and movies and it works great. I also liked the free targus bag that came with it although it was a little too big for the laptop. I am very pleased with this product and the price.
5,60's Superstar,"I'm very close to this lovely ladies age and for close to 50 years have loved her and her music. The music of the early 60's was second to none, unlike what they call music today. When Leslie sang like many others of her time you could atleast understand the words. It was music to have high school crushes on, first loves . Music you don't forget a month after it comes out. After all these years I can still sit around and sing along with the music. You can't do that with the music of today. The teen idols gave you memories todays ""singers just give you a headache......"
2,Doesn't Live Up to The Title,"Leaves out a lot of her hits, but does include the original versions of ""It's My Party,"" ""You Don't Own Me,"" ""That's the Way Boys Are,"" ""Look of Love,"" ""California Nights,"" and ""Maybe I Know."" The rest is awful filler material that should never have made it onto a CD with this title."
3,(I can't think of a pun right now; I'm not finished),"I haven't heard the entire CD yet, but the tracks I did hear are pretty dope. When I first heard ""Compton"" (f/Beenie Man) on the radio, I was completely fooled. I figured it was a posthumous Biggie track, until I saw the video. Shyne doesn't really sound/flow much like B.I.G. anymore (which is good, since he can develop his own sound), but Guerilla Black has that style down, not only in flow, but also in appearance! And the twist side about it is that he's from the WEST COAST (So who's the Eastside 2Pac? 50? Ja?...forget I said that). However, it wouldn't surprise that this dead-on replica of Biggie (RIP) would upset some fans, but they're is no denying that this guy's been doing his homework. Like I said, I only heard ""Compton"", ""Guerilla Nasty"" (f/ Jazze Pha), and ""Trixxx"", but you GOTTA check out the title track. Both the vivid rhymes and the laid-back soundscape would do Big or even Pac lovers proud.(TO BE COMPLETED)"
1,Guerilla City is Guerilla Predicable.,"Guerilla City is just another woeful and silly attempt to cash in on ready to die the 1994 late notorious b.i.g. classic that made him a star and made him real, not it's just a gimmick with instead of brooklyn, this time it's set in the compton with guerilla black embarrasses himself with poor lyrics, and some good beats.This and the documentary should never be called the savior of the west coast rap.If you want a real west coast album pick up xzibit's weapons of mass destruction.This Album is so awful, it makes even faith evans look jealous, too bad she isn't listening to this.Music Rating *1/2 Stars.Thumbs Down"
2,ok...,"well... ok. i've read reviews saying that he stole biggies style, but why are his lyrics so painfully terrible? maybe they just seem so much worse because i'm expectin somethin at the level of big. but hes not even decent. if i didnt put any thought into it, this would be a -15 star. i gave him 2 stars since he does a pretty good job of imitating biggie.whoever this ignorant fool who thinks ""black put big on the slow-flow"", must be a genius to know that black was the only slow flow rapper and therefore single handedly gave biggie all his talent. we should have known that black was the ""origonal.""heres a few pieces of blacks talent:""You said you had a man, I was like 'where?'It was something so different about youI felt so gifted around youEven though you had a man and all""""And me sitting there, playing wit your buttTook off your clothes, I hit it on the counchEven though mom's in the house""wow. this sounds like a little white girl is writin these rhymes."
1,Rip off artist,"This album should be boycotted by real hip hop heads//before biggie comes back from the dead//and puts this buster in a hospital bed....For ya'll that don't know G Black hasn't always sounded like biggie. He just recently switched his flow up(check his mixtapes from two years ago). He jacked BIG's entire style from rap to clothes to video's, and that beat he jacked for his ""hit"" single compton is from a classic dancehall song from over 10 years ago. He's a biter plain and simple....pick up Wordsworth ""Mirror Music"" or Jean Grae ""This Week"" for some real HIP HOP, or if yous a youngin grab some BIGGIE and call it a day!"
3,MRS.M.M.SMITH...YOU JUST MAD BECAUSE YOU SMELL LIKE SH*T!!!,"THIS ALBUM SOUND OK TO ME,IM NOT A DIE HARD FAN,BUT GIVE THIS GUY SOME CREDIT...ALL THOSE WACK MC'S YOU LISTEN TO LIKE D-12,OR SPORTY THIEVZ...BIT*H YOU NEED TO WAKE UP AND SMELL THA COFFEE!!LET ME PUT YOU ON TO SOME MOBB DEEP,THREE SIX MAFIA,G-UNIT...COME ON HOME GIRL KEEP IT TRILL!!!KEITH MURRAY'S FIRST ALBUM DONT HAVE SH*T ON HIS SECOND ALBUM AND THAT'S ENIGMA!!!"
3,Cat sounds like Big,"G Black is a newcomer to the rap industry who's getting attention because he sounds very very similiar to the late Biggie.After buying and listening to this cd I couldn't belive that this dude sounds so much like big some songs You would swear it's him! Saying that this cd is a little to slow for me. Most of the songs had an r&b feel to them and it just didn't have enough riding songs,with the exception of the Nate Dog track. Guerilla Black proved to me though that he is worth listening to,and even though he can't come close to biggie with lyrics brings something to the table."
1,Can't Do It!,"Now I can forgive another MC for sounding like another MC. Sometimes cats voices are just similar. But I can't forgive GB for using the exact same cadence as Biggie. Same pauses, flow, mannerisms, clothes, and everything. I refuse to buy it on that alone. First Shine, and now GB. When is it gonna stop? Let the brutha rest in peace!"
1,IT'S SHAME!!!!!!,"""You got to have style and learn to be original or else everybody's gonna dis you""....said KRS ONE. dude need to take that advice. All I hear is BIG on this joint, this cat gonna have a real short career if he don't switch up his flow."
2,Where would he be without Biggie??,"no this album was just a really poor attempt at being the B.I.G. People say, ""Well he isnt Biggie, hes Guerilla Black!!"" I dont care, if he got his voice, well he cant do anything about that....but his style is exactly like Bigs...i dont agree wit this album at all, but the beats are nice...thats why i gave it the 2 stars i gave it...but still he needs to try something a little different, something that will characterize who he is, cus i think hes got something going for him. But it aint what hes doing now..."
1,how did this guy get a deal,"JESUS CHRIST. I know its obvious but this guy sucks big time. any1 thinkin of coppin this cd needs to have there hed examined. this fat mufu**a is jockin the late BIG and thinkin no one will notice that he lookks and raps EXACTLY like biggie. its not even funny, just sickening. maybe GB cant help his tone of voice but someone actually signed him knowing that he was gonna get sum dough from fatboy.must be tha worse a&r ever.as a hip hop fan u shud cop ready to die by big and get that freestyle with big, pac, shyheim and the other guy, that sheezy iz off tha heezy. for reazy.GB is gonna lose his deal soon im sure.hes tryin to destroy the legacy of big and bad boy records.mario whinings even appeers on a song.thers no loyalty ther puff. this guy is a disgrace to hip hop. decent west coast cds include the game,snoops last meal n doggystyle, tha doggpounds, pac, nwa, CMW and any1 else who didnt feel tha need to mercilessly rip off anuther rapper"
3,is it a gimmick?,ain't heard the album so didn't want to it give 1 star but i was reading xxl magazine and mc eiht said he knew who game was through the street's but he ain't never even heard of guerilla black and eiht is also from compton. eiht also questions how black does a street song about compton for one single then has another single about making love. basically he goes on to inquire that virgin records just packaged black as a gimmick of being a westcoast biggie. it did seem weird that some guy that resembled biggy physically and sounded like him too just happened to appear.
3,Not bad.....,"He may sound like Biggie, but he isn't, and I find it hilarious that people constantly hate on this guy because of that. He's being himself, and that's a good thing. ""Trixxx"" is probably the best cut on here. The production overall is very good, and the lyricism is OK. Overall, I give this a 3."
1,He doesn't really sound that way....,I listend to this album on the internet for a little while and i compared it to some Biggie songs and was not surprised to see the sound match. So i then messed around with a DJ thingy i have only to find the voice was edited to sound like B.I.G. he doesn't really sound that way at all. I am sad to see someone would studio change his voice to sound like Biggie. For the album its horrible. Lyrics don't even sound right when you listen to them. Not one song is NOT about women at some point in the song. Overall i give him something for having the balls to put this out using voice changers to make it sound like B.I.G. and for using Biggie Type lyrics on some of his songs but that can't even save the album from being horrible. If you want to hear how this poor imatator really sounds download any program that lets you change the pitch of voice of a music file.
1,This album is pretentious,"Guerilla City *1/2This album i'm sorry to say is a dissappointing rip-off of notorious b.i.g. though it does have decent production, the rapping is horrible, the writing is a mess, and the lyrics are otherwritten, And I Have to disagree with one person from amazon.com about the documentary, I Didn't like that one either, sure game's ""reviving the west"", but he's doing it with poor rapping and I'm convinced that rappers like Sir Mix a Lot, MC Hammer, The Game and Guerilla Black should be stay out of the mainstream business.If you want a real west coast album, go pick Xzibit's Weapons of Mass Destruction.Thumbs Down for me on Guerilla City and the Documentary, because they are both pretty silly."
1,Biggie is rolling over in his grave,"Now ive heard guys that bite other rappers style pretty bad but this is crazy. He takes him rhymes, flow and even look in this lame attempt to recreate a legend. Go buy a Biggie CD for f*cks sake and leave this junk alone."
5,"thank you, Amazon","I envy y'all americans...as a brazilian living in the US, I am so glad to find all these underated bands that delivered such amazing albuns some 25+ yrs ago (Trapeze, captain beyond, etc). Keep the good work, there will always be customers for quality. Trapeze is just great, they're the music... we're just the (amazed) audience."
4,"Its not Medusa, but a worthwhile buy.","I'm shocked that no one has already reviewed this CD. I purchased this LP soon after it was originally released. Trapeze was a very interesting band and I always felt it was a shame that Glenn Hughes jumped ship to Deep Purple. His best work really was with Trapeze after all. I did see this band in '75 or so without Glenn and they still did a great job, but he was missed.If you're a Trapeze fan I would first buy Medusa, then this."
5,"Wow, Exciting Power Trio Rn'R!","Friends, This is honest rock n roll. And what a pedigree too. You have the incomparible Glenn Hughes of Deep Purple and Black Sabbath on bass and vocals, Mel Galley of Whitesnake on guitars, and Dave Holland of Judas Priest on drums. This is straight up power trio rock, it sounds nothing like the bands that these musicians were later known for. The boys are from the British Midlands, but it sounds like a refined Southern USA rock outfit. Sometimes the sound is like OLD ZZ Top (not the electronic clap-trap of the last 20 years), sometimes they are like a funk band, and sometimes heavy metal. I cannot help but think of pre-corporate...sell out Aerosmith at twice the speed, mixed in with some off the rails 1980s Gn'R for a latter day comparison. All the musicians make magic on this cd so BUT IT NOW!!"
5,I threw Glenn hughes out of my house.,"I havent heard the album in question,but I'm listening to medusa as I'm writting this. I meet gleen at dannys rock club in atlanta ga.Noone knew who he was.we Had toddies it was brilliant!!! As I was leaving He pulled up next to me and I thought I was Going to S@*t. We went to his place He had all his deep purple gold records all over the wall, Medusa gold album.we left his place we went to my place with his girlfriend I was with my girl and he became beligerent>for resons I cant explain in this review.I had him sign my medusa album and my hughes thrall album{which he was amazed that I had }And then I threw him out of my house.I'm 45 years old I have been listening to glenn for many moons.and I threw him out of my house how F**ked up is that!`"
2,Came with a 13mm air bubble,"Arrived with a 13mm air bubble inside the capsule. There was no evidence of leakage so I'm not sure how this bubble got in there, except during the manufacturing process. Anyway, it's not the way it should be so I initiated a return (pretty simple with Amazon) and headed down to the local dive shop and purchased one for $13 more, including tax.I was disapointed that a new product from Suunto came in this condition, but it was returned with postage paid by Amazon."
4,The real Deal!!!,"I went to the Rum Boogie back in March 04, saw James Govan and felt truly blessed. His voice is strong, thick, and gravely. He's tense with passion, yet unassuming and modest. In short, he's an underappreciated legend. I bought a disc at the bar and heard him cover some classics better than the originals. If your a fan of the Menphis blues, get some James Govan."
5,Oh so comfortable!,"These are the most comfortable boots I have owned. I do not feel the heels at all (I teach for 4 1/2 hours straight). If you are considering buying them, they are true to the size both at the bottom and top. Thus, if you want to wear thick socks or leg warmers with them, order the boots half or one full size larger."
2,Complete Maya Programming,"You can indeed learn more by pressing F1 on Maya itself. The C++ API part (the one I was interested in) is really short and the examples rather simple (you can read it all in few hours).The book is ok, but should be called ""Very Basic Introduction to MEL and C++ API"" and not ""An extensive guide to MEL and C++ API"" at all."
3,Average,"Covers very basic material- most of which could be read from the Maya API help anyway. What I was expecting was a book written in the ""Game programming GEMS"" style, where multiple case studies are taken up and solved using MEL (as in Stripnis's book) or MAYA API. What we get is some simple examples, better resources can be found on the web. The API section is written better than the MEL section. This opinion is from a programmers standpoint,artists impression may differ."
5,Must have book for serious maya freaks,"This is book is far more better than I expected, just like the previous guy said I can't put it down, its got stuff that explained extremely well, and damn fun to read.If you are an artist this book is easy to understand.If you are a C/java programmer this book is very easy to understandif you are some sort of computer science or related student, this is damn easy and very fun to read.I have loads of text books some I read few pages and now is in the dust, but this one is one of a kind that you can't get anywhere else."
3,Good mostly for MEL users,"The book gives you a good insight into Maya programming. The MEL part seems to be quite good, but the C++ part is organized by a couple of examples. Altough they are useful lots of things are missing. A short reference, I would say, 10-20 pages of the API would be perfect."
2,"Good concept, not well executed","I have spent some time in Pondicherry, and was interested by the description of the book. Not a very well organized book, the photos look quite dated. I would not recommend this book."
2,BAD PACKING!!,I GOT THIS AND WAS VERY HAPPY TO HAVE! BUT THE WAY IT WAS PACKAGE IT SCRATCHED THE DVD'S!! NEED TO CHANGE THE WAY THAT IT IS PACKAGED!!
1,The Plane is sensitive for any crash and the RC joystick hand got twisted loose,"My experiences showed me that the plane was not that user-friendly. The first time I tried to fly it, it crashed. The styrofoam around where the battery is located broke, the wheels fell off, as did the plastic parts connected to the wheels. I managed somehow (not perfectly) to fix these problems with scotch tape.In the third (last) time I tried to fly it, the remote control joystick handle got twisted loose, so I could not control the plane properly. It crashed into a very high tree, and despite my attempts (along with several friends and park rangers) to retrieve it, we could not get it down.In short, it's very sensitive and I think it's made of very cheep parts...."
2,inflatable globe,"would work best if not played with. it comes with a string set to hang from the ceiling but we played with ours and it popped. bought it in sept 2011, was in trash by thanksgiving 2011."
2,Not as helpful as would have liked.,Not all of the countries are labeled. The ones that are labeled are hard to read. It will be hard for children to learn geography this way.
4,Fun/educational toy,"I originally bought this for my students in my earth science class, but it turned out not to work for the project I was doing, so instead I gave it to my five year old step-son and he loves to play with it and toss it around. It's a good tool to teach kids the continents."
3,Dallas is not in Oklahoma,"It's cute, very colorful and appears to be made of sturdy plastic. One problem, the cities in Texas are located incorrectly on the globe. Good thing my son is a toddler and can't read yet. I'm going to have to just point."
4,This is a great first globe!,"I bought this for my daughter as part of her birthday present when she turned 2...and she LOVES it. We point to where Grandad and Nanie live overseas and where we live, and where our other friends live elsewhere...and she enjoys it very much. She makes a plan motion when she says she is visiting grandad and can find it on the globe! It is a lot of fun, especially if you are in to travel or have family or friends overseas! Great toy!"
4,Fun Learning & Play,"This is a wonderful product for children. My son is very young so he only enjoys it as a colorful ball but as he grows up i'm hoping he will notice it more and more as a globe. The size is great for children of all ages and seems to be pretty sturdy. I love the plastic ring thing attached to the top of it, because it allows me to hang it while my son can hit the call lying down. The one thing I didn't like is the quality of plastic. It has that plastic smell for a while, but I washed it before blowing it up and seems to have done the trick as the smell is no longer there."
3,"Good learning toy, not durable","This is a cheap toy, so I can't complain, I guess. I homeschool my kids and bought two of these to use instead of buying more expensive ""real"" globes. The words are a bit fuzzy, but it serves my purpose of helping the kids picture the world as a ball instead of a flat map - so they can picture the location of the countries in relation to other countries much easier than on a map.My biggest complaint is that even without playing with them, both balls developed leaks large enough that we couldn't repair them. They are worth the few dollars we paid, but I won't be buying them again - eventually I'll have spent enough to buy the ""real"" thing."
2,flaccid,"Uninflates on its own very quickly. And just gets saggy :( I can never get it full. I just keep having to blow it up. It doesn't have holes, it just deflates naturally."
1,Poor quality,"I put this globe on my Amazon wish list for my kid for Christmas, and we received it as a gift. We were excited, until we tried to blow it up. It had not one but *two* leaks, and one of the leaks someone had clearly tried to fix already. This was packaged as new, but the globe is useless. I still think it is a good idea and want my kid to be able to play with it, but we're going to look elsewhere to buy it."
5,Inexpensive & fun teaching aid,"As a teacher, I like to find interesting ways to engage kids in learning. The kids love to catch the ball and find continents, oceans, countries, etc."
1,Inaccurate and politically motivated maps -Should not be sold!!,A product that does not provide the World map correctly does not qualify to be sold as a globe. This Globe shows the Indian Map inaccurately. Request you to please remove this product till they fix this issue.
4,inflatable plastic globe,"This is a quality product. Good detail. Holds air well, ready to blow up and hang from attached loop. An excellent buy."
1,Bad quality,"It seems to be a nice globe on the Amazon picture but it is really bad quality.The air globe would deflate every 5 minutes. There was a hole on it (punctured) and if you touch you can feel the material is really bad, so I decided to ask for refund instead of replacement.It has a good size and the City/countries are correct though."
1,Totally junk product,The surface has a lot of overlapped regions along the line connecting two neighboring pieces. So don't expect to see a complete map or text captioning.It also cannot hold the air for 10 minutes.I am very disappointed that Amazon is selling products which are worst than dollar stores' stuff now.Totally waste of money and time.I am returning it.
2,"Sorry, but it is rubbish","I might have got the wrong item, but no, it is the Learning Resources LER 2432.All the City names are perfect, 5 Stars. But all country names are wrong, 0 Stars. How can I use it for teaching? It looks even very different to the picture on amazon and on learning resources. The colours are different the shape is absoloutely different and the quality is not good at all, it is more an old tomato than a globe."
1,DISASTER!,"We were all ready to blow up our new globe and spot where we live, where we would be going on vacation etc. To my daughters huge disappoinment the moment we blew it up it started to loose air in several places.. VERY VERY NOT RECOMMENDABLE!!!!"
3,Could be better,"This had such great reviews, I thought it would be good. It's okay, but honestly, everywhere there's a seam about 1/2 inch of the globe is missing. It's really obvious with Australia, where the eastern side of the country is completely chopped off. Most of Egypt isn't there. In addition, the ball is lopsided and it buldges near the top.If you're looking for perfection, this isn't it. But if you just want your kids to have a general idea of what the planet looks like, then it works."
2,Came with a hole puncture,I bought this for my 1 year old daughter to play with. It's a perfect size for her to throw around. But it had a hole right out of the bag. I tried to repair with tape but it still leaked air. I trashed it as the price wasn't even worth returning. :(
2,South Sudan shows but places are all a few mm to the left!,"Not impressed with this product. It will make a good beach ball for my 2 year old but be a bit useless to help teach geography. It was 1 of the more expensive options (albeit in the less than $10 range!) to choose from so I thought it would be a good buy. Edinburgh is where Glasgow should be, Lisbon & Brest, are well out to sea. San Diego & San Francisco are west of the coastline. Toronto is no where near Lake Ontario & on a personal note I know for sure that Aberdeen, Scotland is not located at Inverness. Not very accurate, worse than in the photos supplied for the object & for the price should be better."
2,Inflatable? Yes. Stays inflated? No.,"I wasn't necessarily looking for geographic accuracy. I know several others have complained about that issue. I wanted to use it as a prop for a birthday activity in my preschool and simply need an inflatable globe that stays inflated. This globe is lacking in that department. It's supposed to be a sphere, but ends up looking a little more like a slowly deflating tire. It's still somewhat sphere-like on the top, but kind of flat on the bottom. I wasn't looking for a product that I'd have to inflate every time a child in my class has a birthday, but that is what I'm having to do."
1,The worst globe I have ever seen,"This is the worst globe I have ever seen. It is full of errors when it comes to territory marking. Amazon should not market this as a Globe. Instead market it as a beach ball alone.Regarding shipping. it didn't reach me on time. Even for a prime account it took more than 5 days. When I complained, amazon sent me one item in one day shipping. Even that didn't reach me on time."
2,Faded,"I ordered this product for my nephew as he requested a globe for Christmas. Upon receiving it I was disappointed.Some of the countries were faded off,making it useless."
2,Nothing good every lasts,"I bought this for my first grade class. It was great having a globe I could use readily (my actual globe is a bit heavy and cumbersome to carry around the classroom). The kids had fun tossing it around as well. After a few weeks a hole formed and it really lost any function. I understand that it's inflatable, but if you plan on using it in the classroom you probably plan on having the students use it. You need something sturdier. I also saw a similar globe at my local party shop (!) and it was much cheaper! This inflatable globe is not worth the cost here."
2,Disappointed - not accurate,"I ordered this globe for my son who is starting to get interested in geography. Unfortunately, the one that I received is out of date and has countries on it that no longer exist, such as Zaire. While he will enjoy playing with it and learning about where different countries are located, do not count on it to be accurate. Zaire changed its name in 1997, so they have had time to update this product."
2,Punctured - does not stay inflated,"I found the globe to be per the reviews I have read here, good detail and size... a wonderful buy for the price. The only problem I faced, and that being a major one, is as I soon realised that the air globe would deflate every 15 minutes. I am sure I received it that way because there has been no mis-handling since I laid my hands on it unless something went wrong while filling it up. I do see a puncture kit in the package though. I need to get this thing drowned in some water and see if I can ""nail that puncture"".But yes, my low rating is purely for the punctured globe I received. It might just have been one bad piece in the stock. It had to be mine!01/22/2011: The hole is along one of the folds and the puncture kit does not help in sealing it. It's been a loss of money for me. I haven't gone through the pain of trying to return the product, etc. Don't think I will. This one's for trash."
1,"Stinky plastic, and the map is not readable between seams","Bought this for young child.This map is extremely stinky when you open the packaging. Fill the whole room with a plastic odor.After blowing it up, the text on the maps are not very readable. And, along the seams, the overlap is not precise, so some cities and text is missing. When my child points to some cities or countries on this inflatable globe, I can't tell my child what that is because the text is missing inside the seam.Get a real globe."
2,Many mistakes,I was disappointed to find many places incorrectly marked on the globe (eg London was on the West (not East) of England). I wouldn't buy again especially as I payed full price for it.
4,Interesting Mother/Daughter dynamic,"I enjoyed the book quite a bit. I related to both the mother and daughter in different ways throughout their lives. There were two main points for me 1. God will always welcome me back with open arms (I know this is true from experience), and 2. it made me take a long look at my health and I have now started a journey to take better care of myself.I thought it was a good story and I definitely shed a few tears."
3,"Borrow, don't buy this book",I checked this book out at my local library on a whim. Basically because it was a christian based book and I'm always on the look out for a good one. I had higher hopes for this book than what it delivered.
2,it's ok,I enjoyed The Flirtations rendition of Mr. Sandman in the movie Philadelphia. I didn't enjoy the cd as much. I apologize for such a short review.
3,World HW Champs,Some surprising and candid comments especially by Foreman like the fact that his knees were shaking before the Frazier fight and how imposing Norton looked to him before blasting out both of them.
3,Too Bad the Fine Qualities Are Diminished by the Awful Music,"What a shame this fine production is marred -- somewhat RUINED -- with the music they chose--all that sad, sentimental, tragic, 'wipe away the tears', 'funeral for a noble hero' music... UGHHHH!!!! Give me a break!!Such a heavy layer of emotional manipulation!Let the VIEWER decide how to feel about the material!!What a shame. The interviews and fight clips are very good.On another note, I'm watching a newer documentary, Facing Ali, and so far it is EXCELLENT.I HIGHLY recommend it to fans of boxing in the sixties & seventies.Ali fans might also enjoy the documentary of Ali preparing to fight Foreman in Africa (1974) 'When We Were Kings'.It captures some of the flavor of what it was like to hang out with Ali and his entourage (their playful banter) at his training camp in PA in the seventies, which I did."
4,Great for the price,"This dress runs true to size. If you're a 2-6 order Sm. 8-10 order Med. This is not for the shy type I'm 5'7"" and it is exactly as short as the picture suggests. I purchased mine for a private show not clubbing though."
3,Song Number Two,"This is a very catchy and well done CD.However the second song on the CD, despite its upbeat tempo, is a sad, sad song. I found my little girl in a puddle of tears after listening to this song. The theme of the song is that a little baby bird wakes up to find his Mama and Papa have gone ""far, far away"". And, no, the baby bird is never re-united with its parents.If you have a sensitive older child who listens to song lyrics, you might be wise to skip over this song. Sadly, the tune is one of the best ones on the CD, in my opinion."
5,"Catchy songs, happy and upbeat","My daughter is a huge Dora fan (she also likes Diego). This CD hit the mark for her and I enjoy it as well. The songs have a good beat and are very cheery and fun. There is just enough of Dora and Diego talking/singing throughout so that she can tell it is a ""Dora"" product, which is key with a little one who only wants to hear her favorites."
3,Hey! That sounds......familiar.....,"I bought this film as a Deborah Harry fan, not really expecting much. Nelvana's animation has always had a bit of a ""creepy"" edge to it to me (the exception being the Star Wars Droids and Ewoks cartoons), so I knew I wouldn't be blown away by the animation. About halfway through ""Angel's Song"", something hit me....although the music from this film was never released, there was something VERY familiar about that song. Once I was able to process it, I knew why. Fans of the film that long for music from it would do well to check out Deborah Harry's 1989 release ""Def, Dumb & Blonde"".....the track ""Maybe For Sure"" pretty much IS ""Angel's Song"" (or ""Send Love Through""), just with different lyrics."
4,It's about time,What a movie. Great music. Interesting concepts. New DVD lacks the brightness of the original format. Great for early heavy metal movie junkies.
4,Critics are SO sad!,"Solomon was obviously so busy picking the movie apart that he forgot to enjoy it. To set the record straight, ""Rock and Rule"" is not great art. I obviously didn't die happy after seeing it. What it IS is entertaining. The animation was (is) stylish for the time. The storyline was good. The characters are likable (even the bad guys). The music is great. Twenty years on, snippets of the songs still surface from the murky depths of my poor mind. It's well worth seeing. I'd definitely place it within my top ten favorite animated films."
5,Rock and Rule - Finally Re-Released,"I had recalled the movie ""Rock and Rule"" a few years back and started looking for information online, alas to find very little. I did happen upon a site which rumoured that it was going to be re-released on DVD. When it was finally available it did not disappoint. Thanks Amazon for carrying this. My only regret was that the Canadian version was not able to be remastered due to the destruction of the original master."
5,"Great Paint, But","This is a great product, but didn't realize it was available at Lowes. I could have saved the cost of shipping of this and the two other colors that I bought at the same time."
2,"Tiny, tiny, tiny",Clever idea but the dimensions should reflect the size of the actual bank rather than the package in it's entirety. I doubt that this little piggy would hold a dollar's worth of change. Too bad...
3,This thing is TINY!,"I bought this as a gift for my niece and I have to admit I was disappointed by it. It is so small. I bet it wouldn't hold a roll of quarters. The whole box is smaller than one of my size five shoes. Other than that, it is cute and fun. Very good for girlie-girls."
1,Too small,I was shocked at how tiny this piggy bank was when I received it. I haven't taken it out of the box yet but it appears it can hold a couple dollars in change. My fault for not reading the description.
1,TINY TINY TINY,I cannot believe that this was so small! I ordered 5 of these for Christmas gifts as my children and my girlfriends children have been doing chores to earn/save some money and we've been using baby food jars for piggy banks. Guess what? The baby food jars hold more money than the piggy bank! Very disappointed! I suppose that the price was good for what we got but I could NOT be more unhappy with this product.
2,itty bitty piggy,i got this for my daughter for christmas well it just showd up and to my surprise it is the tinyest piggy bank i have ever seen ! its about the size of my fist i realy thought it would be biggy then that !
3,MINIATURE piggy bank,"This piggy bank is much smaller than the 5 inches listed on the product dimensions. The box that it comes in is 5 inches tall and the little piggy bank is only 2 inches tall, barely large enough to hold 2 dollars worth of change. So think of it as a fun craft, but not as a useful piggy bank."
1,TINY,"This is practically useless as an actual piggy bank. It's tiny - not more than 2 1/2 inches from head to tail. Perhaps it would make a cute party favor or something, but even then - at this price, I don't know that it would be worth it."
3,Little Piggy,It is in fact a piggy bank with a rubber stopper so you don't have to smash it to get the money out but it's VERY TINY. Might hold 5 dollars in quarters. It does the job but it's VERY TINY.
4,"4 stars for cuteness, but MUCH smaller than it looks in the photo","I bought this as part of a bday present for a craft-loving 5yr old. It's about the size of a softball. It looked bigger to me in the picture, so I was surprised but at $5 it's what I should have expected. Nonetheless it's very cute and I'm sure the bday girl will enjoy decorating it. The packaging makes it look like a nice gift add-on too! I have prime shipping, and it arrived in 2 days as promised!"
4,so far so good,"Just got it yesterday and it seemed to work nicely. I called their customer service about the temperature tolerance of these bottles, and they said it would withstand hot boiling water, which makes this bottle even more useful for me!"
3,Lesson about TV,The book had an underlying message that my students talked about. I'd read it again.
4,The Wretched Stone,"A journey to the Sea becomes a mysterious adventure, where even the captain and crew must escape to tell their tale."
4,The Wretched Stone,"The Wretched Stone is a book that works well with chlidred k-3. This book can be used for predicting, inferring, and ejoyment. The text has a few nautical vocabulary words, but nothing that cannot be expalined to the childrne can get the full meaning of the text. Children enjoy guessing what will happen to the crew of the ship. Will they stay monkeys? or make it back to land safely? A recommend this book for read alouds or mini lessons in the classroom."
5,Real Movie-Hits home,"The story of a young white lawyer who goes to play ball in Chicago's inner city Cabrini Green. With a lively cast of characters who play true to life people and a bumpin' soundtrack, it's a great movie. Michael Warren and D.B. Sweeney play two men who form a unique friendship to overcome the hardships of inner-city life, breaking many of the steriotypical molds applied to people of the home of some of the greatest basketball stars the world can ever know. As a white kid playing ball on the crest of the city, this movie is my untold story."
3,"Mediocre movie, nowhere near as good as the book","I agree with R. ZumMallen. I read Rick Telander's book (which this movie is very loosely based on) at least three times before I saw the movie, so I was familiar with the story going in. To say the least, the movie falls far short of what it could have been. In the book, Telander spends a lot of time giving you a sense of the teenaged playground ballers he got involved with during his time in Brooklyn, and I came away fascinated by Rodney Parker, an adult who was part hustler, part father confessor to the young men. The film could've revolved around him, but that's not how they wrote it. Yes, the book has a lot of basketball in it, but the game is a subtext to a larger story that the film barely touches on.If you're a basketball fan who hasn't read the original story, the film won't be bad. If you've read the book, pass on the flick. You'll barely recognize it."
1,I'd pass on this unless you are in a protected wheel house or cabin,I installed this on the center console of my boat last fall. One season of storage under a cover and ever single rocker switch failed! All three! Plus the fuses are ridiculously hard to remove and the quality was low.
2,I'd pass on this unless you are in a protected wheel house or cabin,"I installed this on a Center Console boat. It was easy to install and the lighted switches are nice and the rockers have a nice solid ""click"" and feel....but it does not seem like a good fit for a location that is exposed to the elements. One weekend of use on the water and a couple of rainstorms while sitting in the driveway and two of the three circuits don't work and there is oblivious corrosion forming in the fuse panel. Seems like a true marine product should last more than two weeks...."
3,Dog chewed it up in three days but it worked,It worked well!!! My dog can clear a 6ft fence from a standing start. I put the harness on and she seemed comfortable but couldn't fully extend her hind legs. She did not like having it on but it didn't hurt her. Unfortunely it did not last long. She managed to chew it up in to pieces by the third day of wearing it.
4,I like it....my dog doesn't.,"We bought this product because our dog herniated a disk in her back and isn't allowed to jump up on the couch or bed anymore. It is a little laborious to put on, but once we got it on, it worked great! My dog is a 20 lb. Beagle, so we really had to size it down, but once we cut off the excess straps, it worked great! Fortunately, my Beagle is not a chewer, otherwise she'd chew right through the thin straps. My lab/shepherd mix would never be able to wear it. She would chew through it within seconds if we used it on her. Thankfully we don't have to. I would recommend it for smaller, non-chewing dogs."
2,really,Well we have a large dog that doesnt know how to stay in the yard. He literally climbs the fence. I thought this would help. Nope.
2,Didn't work like it claims to!,"My dog is a German Sheperd and has destroy our back screen door. I bought this product to keep her from destroying the new back screen door. It only keeps her from staying upright, not the her first jump. I guess I am going to half to build fence to keep her off the house."
4,Righteousness and Politics,"Stewart Woods once again brings back Will Lee as he continues the Lee legacy of moral outrage and political integrity in Georgia and Washington, DC. Will risks his career in national politics to return home and take on the case of a rapist/murderer who convinces him of his innocence. . . until the case falls apart. I won't expose the twisted trail leading to an humbing end where Will must carefully evaluate his moral compass. As we've come to expect with the Lee series, there is the usual southern plantation courtesy and stubborn moral incaltrance coupled with racial hatred. Lots of twists and turns as are expected from Stewart Woods making a fun read. As always, Orv"
5,Another dynamo.,Stuart Woods knows how to get to the heartof his themed bookds - look forward to the nextone and the next. Keep putting them out
2,Grass Roots - Stuart Woods,Not one of his best efforts - drags a bit - he is at his best with Stone Barrington stories.
4,Woods Really Can Write,"""Grass Roots"" is most enjoyable -- well written, exciting, fast moving, good plot and subplots. A far cry from such recent duds as ""Hot Mahogany"" and ""Short Straw."""
4,Great Woods,"This is a book for Stuart Woods' lovers as well as someone looking for a book about todays politics. Most of the characters were real with just enough exageration to keep them interesting. Woods books all read quick so they are great summertime books, pick them up on the beach, read them at the pool or even half drunk. It is very hard to write a book that a person half in the bag would like reading. Yea, I like to read sometimes when I have had a few, it really brings the characters to life, try it. Its a fun book. Read it!"
3,Shipping Time,"I ordered 4 used books from private sellers at the same time and the book from A1Books, Grass Roots by Stuart Woods, took 2 weeks longer to receive than the other 3 books."
5,another great film by mike,Mike did it again!another great movie inside the life that most people will never understand.with the condition of the game today a great work of art that was surely difficult to produce!I loved it but I love all of the too real for tv videos so i guess I'm a fan
1,Sweeping Generalizations,"Mumford takes very few facts and weaves them into a simplistic view of history. He says things that more current historians know are not true -- not just passing along incorrect facts, but misinterpreting the facts he does use. I don't know how accurate his 18th and 19th century assumptions are. All I know is that no one should use Mumford as a reliable source for medieval research. Even as a window on the 1930s, it offers a poor view."
3,Review of the 2010 University of Chicago Press Edition,"Readers should be aware that the 2010 University of Chicago Press edition of Technics and Civilization omits Mumford's 15 pages of photographs. As an excuse they say that such a reproduction is neither ""practical"" nor ""necessary,"" instead they provide a set of search terms that may or may not allow one to find each image on the Internet.I am, to say the least, disappointed by this decision. 1) Given that most of these images are out of copyright and are readily available (if nothing else, one could simply scan them from an earlier edition of the book) what are the practical obstacles to reproduction? 2) The ability to interrupt one's reading to search for and possibly find a particular image on the Internet is hardly a viable substitute for having images embedded in the text.I suggest that readers find an earlier, complete edition of this work, if possible."
5,Follow directions carefully,This lamp worked great - after I added 3 drops of dish detergent (as described in the instructions). Otherwise the beads stick to the sides and do not go up the volcano for the eruptions. My girls love it as a night light - but they actually can't sleep because it's so facinating.
3,Great for desk top.,"I got this for my 3 year old son. He is in love with volcanoes. He loves it. The lighting effects are just led lights, not very realistic. A little sound would of been nice too. Otherwise its is great the ball fall slowly looks great."
4,Great product. Would buy another,"Bought this to hang my Sharp 46"" LE700 LED LCD TV on a brick wall over my fireplace. We anchored it into the bricks (not mortar) with 10 anchors. Might have been overkill, but I don't wanna buy another TV ;) My brother fully extended the arms and hung his weight off of it (didn't lift his legs off the ground though) and it didn't budge. I feel very comfortable with this mount keeping my TV safe.It is a bit stiff however, moving it around takes a little TLC to make sure you don't push or pull too hard and smack the backside of the TV's edges against the brick walls. But as long as I'm being cautious towards it, its not a problem. Rather that, than too loose."
4,Will get you laughing,"Oddly enough the 2 stars,Ice Cube and Tracy Morgan had their moments but Katt Wiliiams had me laughing with every word that came out of his mouth.I enjoyed the movie but it was a comedy with a serious tone as far as Ice Cubes child in the movie.The comedy itself as I said was mainly from Katt Williams whereas Ice and Tracy just seemed to set up a joke for Katt to do his thing.Its worth a watch maybe not a purchase although I am glad to have it in my collection."
3,unable to give a review,"I'm still waiting on my order, but the shipper has agreed to give me a ""free"" copy and refund my money because of the problem with this order.I'm sure the reason for the delay was not the shipper's fault."
4,Take it for what it's worth....,"a quick laugh here and there. I think this film was intended to be enlightning and encouraging. Although the delivery was totally weak, the message was heartfelt. If only more men would stop, take stock of what is most important in life and work towards doing everything in their power to create stronger bonds for their children (especially boy children), we would have a brighter future to look forward to.I recommend this movie to the avid movie watcher, who knows that you simply aren't going to ""love"" every movie you see, but enjoy having the opportunity to view various films (at least once)"
3,Kept my interest; but expected more..,"Although, the cast in the movie was fine. I expected more.. I would have want to see more of Ricky Smiley; he is a wholesome, down-to-earth comedian. Overall, it was an ""okay"" movie.Thank you."
3,Hmm,"This is a fairly entertaining film with several solid actors like Ice Cube, Tracy Morgan, and Katt Williams, but the storyline itself left a bit to be desired. The basic setup is that a pair of guys down on their luck think it'd be a good idea to steal money from a church. However, there's already some people at the church so it develops into a hostage situation.The ending is somewhat predictable and cliched, but this film is not without its entertaining scenes. There are some funny lines here even if the overall story was a bit weak. There's a theme of forgiveness in here - not surprising, really - as well as a hard-nosed person who does not want to forgive. It's fun for watching once if you're a fan of any of the actors in this film."
2,not the funniest movie,"i thought this would be funnier because of Kat Williams, but it wasn't that funny. The story was predictable and boring, the acting wasn't that much better."
5,AWESUM MOVIE,"this is a really good movie, it has some really fresh comedy in it, katt williams does and awesome job, very funny. would highly recommend getting and watching this movie."
5,Movie,The movie was in great condition and I am thankful for the service. Movie plays well and it's great for traveling.
2,Original idea.,"I anticipated loving this book. I love Canada and I love winter, and I love good fiction. But I didn't love this book. I think the idea behind it is precious, but I was not satisfied by the content. The elephant dictionary was painful. The autopsy was shocking and dark, but not dark enough. The prose was not haunting or lyrical. So much more could have been described with the budgies and the artwork. The mute character was not developed to be dark until the end of the book. I was not suspicious of him in the least. The love interest Jo, what a shallow character. I would have omitted the dictionary and developed all the characters and visuals more. Rather than tell me what happened, I would have loved to have been able to feel the cold and taste the smells."
3,Too Bad...,"This performance is amazing. The problem is, the quality of the recording itself is terrible. It's fine when you listen to it at low volume, but if you turn it up at all, it gets distorted. The recording was too hot and there's no fixing it even if you have an equalizer. It's sad, because The Sheila Divine are amazing and I wish I was there that night... I'm hoping the 10.10.03 CD is better. I think this CD is still worth having and I listen to it all the time, I just wish I had known what to expect before I bought it."
3,Not Bad,"This isn't a bad movie, but I find it hard to rate it higher because it didn't have many laugh out loud moments. It is a comedy all the way, with a little dose of sweetness. The story is very much like Old School, with a group of outcasts that can't get into college decide to make their own college. The evil dean of the real college tries to destroy them, and in the end they have to get acredited before an education board if they are to survive. It sounds very similar. Except instead of Wilson, Vaugn and Ferrel, you have Justin Long. Long is charming enough, and he is a good actor. Other than him, the movie doesn't have much else. The usual oddball characters, but no one really stands out. Being PG-13 it is not a raunchy comedy. It just misses more than it hits. It is fairly enjoyable to watch once though."
3,Acceptable - C+,"Watchable comedy about high school senior Bartleby Gaines (Justin Long) who has been rejected by every university he applied to. He does not want to disappoint his family and wants to help his friends in same situation.Bartleby uses computer tricks to create a letter saying he has been accepted at a pretend university ""South Harmon Institute of Technology"" (S.H.I.T.) Bartleby's friends help him create this from scratch as he realizes he can rent a building with tuition money his father hands him. The premise takes a leap of faith, but somehow it works.The fun the kids have at the school is contagious. They love school and the fun is featured in many scenes of skateboarding, rock concerts, and general goofing off.The movie gets cheesy and silly, and the ending is ridiculous but you will enjoy overall."
3,A Fun Comedy - More like 3 1/2 stars,"The script was surprisingly very well written for this type of film, lots of good lines, although the S Word was overused. There are many funny scenes in this flick, and there was only about a 10-minute period that was kind of slow. The soundtrack was also a very good choice. This movie is all about the transition from High School to getting started in College. When a student is rejected at all Colleges he applied to, he has the bright idea to start his own College ... first only to show his parents an acceptance letter, but as things go, soon the dad wants to meet the principal after looking through the website of the fake college, and so forth. One thing/lie leads to another to cover up the first thing and so on. It's a spoof and as much as it is a comedy, there's an interesting/serious undertone to this film. I'm sure teenagers will enjoy this flick the most."
3,Not as funny as it looks,"When I first saw the trailer for ""Accepted"" i thought it would be a really hilarious movie, something I would want to watch again and again. But it turns out only to have very few jokes and a predictable ending. If anything just rent the movie to see for yourself, I expected much more from Justin Long since he was in lots of hilarious movies such as ""Dodgeball"" and made a funny cameo in ""The Break-Up"". Overall I gave it 3 stars for Mediocre, or even a 2.5, definately a forgettable movie."
3,Acceptable.,"As teen comedies go, ""Accepted"" hits about par for the course.Trotting out the familiar teen-film moral (fitting in bad, creativity good), the real triumph of ""Accepted"" is that it manages to deliver its message without quite slipping into full-blown clichés. Yes, at times the writers' comedic inspirations are a bit too obvious--the word ""rip-off"" is (not by much) too strong--but that's pretty standard for a Hollywood teen comedy. The writing is for the most part rather weak, but a relatively steady stream of laugh-worthy zingers should keep you watching, waiting for the next one.The actors did an incredible job creating relatable and entertaining characters with a script that left them few real openings. Several enjoyable side-characters provide the most genuine and memorable laughs.On the whole... not bad, but not great either. I would call it... well, ""acceptable."""
3,"""I Hope You Guys Have Hobo Stab Insurance"" ~ The ABC's Of Starting Your Own College","When you think of all the improbable comedy plots thought up over the years for films dealing with college age students knocking heads with the adult ""Powers That Be"" the '06 movie `Accepted' is probably the most far-fetched of all.Question: What does a high school graduate do when rejected by his/her college of choice?Answer: Why go out rent a large building and start a college of their own of course.Yes, that's the plot so be forewarned that it'll take a wee stretch of the imagination to accept the premise and get caught up in the madcap, impossibility of it all. On the positive sides the cast of unknowns are quite good and there are lots of crisp, witty lines of dialogue that help the viewer buy into the storyline. If you like `Animal House' or `Revenge of the Nerds' you'll probably enjoy this one too."
5,GREAT,Love the movie. Could be the most underrated comedy I have ever watched. If you are a recent high school grad you know someone going threw this and it is a must watch.
3,guilty pleasure,"ok,last night i sat down and watch accepted,once i brought this dvd purly because diora baird was in it,only un like hot tamale i really enjoyed this pg 13 comedy."
2,Rather Dumb,"Should have rented the movie first, rather than buying it. Not as good as they made it sound."
2,Ok&Corny,"you know I will watch any type of Movie&sometimes just put anything on&this film fits that bill to a T. it's along the lines of the American Pie style of Formula. I do like the atmosphere of a College where you could select whatever you wanted to do&just do your thing. I wish there was a school like that. I would have stayed there&Chilled. the film is real predictable&Full of cliches,but there are some fun moments. I like the Name of the school."
2,Oh so boring.,"I LOVE what most would call stupid and silly movies. Love 'em. I also think Justin Long is hilarious. So I was expecting this to be a funny ""silly"" movie. Boy was I wrong. I was bored out of my mind. I couldn't wait for it to end! It wasn't the plot or the message, the jokes just weren't funny. At all."
3,acceptable,"Tired of being rejected by colleges and universities he applied to, Bartleby Baines (Justin Long) decides to create a 'fake' university, the South Harmon Institute of Technology (S.H.I.T.). He wants to make his parents proud of who he is, by becoming accepted at that university. With the help of some friends, he will create a too-good-to-be-true place where many students will be accepted.Is it funny? Yes, most times. Clichéd? Very much so. Predictable? Definitely.ACCEPTED is still an enjoyable comedy."
4,A FUNNY HOMAGE TO ANIMAL HOUSE & 80 SCHOOL COMEDIES!,"This movie really surprised me! It is one of the better school based comedies to come out in a long time! Justin Long does a pretty good job carrying this film with the help of some odd,but likable characters. It even has a decent message! I'm sure there are a lot of parents who would like to send there less then steller offspring to a place like ""South Harmond Institute of Technology"". This is worth watching if not owning for sure."
4,Different and fun!,"I don't know why people are writing essays on this particular movie, but I thought it was pretty funny and entertaining. I enjoyed it. Some parts could've been funnier than they were, but for the most part, the movie did it's job....MADE ME LAUGH!!!!"
5,Creativity at it's finest!,"I absolutely loved this movie - and didn't think I was going to when my teenage son brought it home. I appreciate the way the story presents information on how kids that don't fit in to that little ""box"" society would like to put them in, can still be successful by creating learning opportunities in the wildest places.I think every parent should watch this movie with their kids."
4,Pretty fun,"Not the best movie out there but it's light and comical and it's also fun to see some of Jonah Hill before he got too ""big"" if you know what I mean."
3,Not bad,I don't think the movie is all that great. It has its funny points. Specially when they go into the abandoned hospital and Sherman screams. That is the one part that my husband and I rewind and watch over and over. But besides that this movie is kind of dumb. But don't take my word for it. Just make sure if you watch it you have the remote in your hand to rewind the screaming part over and over again..... That is just funny!!!!
2,passable comedy...just not supergreat,"The acting is good but the script sure isn't. In fact, the outtakes are funnier than this entire movie. And what is up with the one guy who dresses like Jack Osbourne (or alternatively has the '70s John McEnroe headband and hair)?There are some classic moments that just fall flat. Plus there are plenty of headscratcher scenes. In one the dean from a rival college reveals on Parents Day at the ""Accepted"" campus that the school is a fake. So why don't the parents all throw a fit demanding their kids' tuition back? I have no idea. They just leave the campus with their kids glaring at the Apple Guy (Justin Long).The rest of the movie is like this. Concept is there but execution is poor."
4,Character driven summer movie,"If you suspend belief, the movie is funny.Take the premise, you start a college from scratch.Hello ... it's not that easy.Add a bunch of nuts with crazy lines.You get humor.The movie was tongue in cheek."
3,school,"I needed this book for a community college class that i was enrolled in. the book is a little difficult to understand, it is micro after all. but the product shipped in good time. Condition was also fine."
4,"Yep, its a map.","Yes, this is a map. It is accurate, easy to use, and helped us navigate our way around lower NY and Westchester county. I did have one close encounter with the Bronx, but I can't place blame on the map for that incident."
4,it just talks and talks,"alright so the only problem is that when i received the box containing the bloo plushie, it was already talking, thus it was not a surprise for my son. that being said he likes it, he can throw it and kick it and bloo exclaims a random non-sequitur like ""i'm sooooo bored"". if you like things that talk when you abuse them go for it."
3,Good With Major Qualifications,"Those coming across Robert Sherwood's ROOSEVELT & HOPKINS might get the idea from the title that it is a biographical / historical study of Franklin Roosevelt's right-hand man, Harry Hopkins, and his relationship with the president. It certainly is, but as such it leaves something to be desired, being neither an astute historical document nor much of a biography of Hopkins, and overstuffed at that.However, that said it is still a very valuable book. Sherwood, who was one of Roosevelt's speechwriters, chose to use Hopkins' wartime notes as the basis for his narrative, fleshing it out with his, Sherwood's, own recollections of the Roosevelt Administration. It's not the best-written book, not a balanced history nor a thorough biography -- but as a historical resource, Hopkin's notes are priceless, and it also has significant value as a memoir of the Roosevelt White House. Maybe not brilliant, but I can say it is a significant resource for anyone interested in the period."
2,"If it wasn't for the girl in the bikini, I would have given it 1 star!","If it wasn't for the girl in the bikini, I would have given it 1 star!I'm not sure how this movie got rated so high (7.2/10 on IMDB, bikini votes), it was a less than average movie, nothing special.The story was pretty weak, many cheesy lines and instances, and the acting not so great.It starts cheesy and ends predictable, a typical Hollywood revisited idea made worse.Don't waste your money, rent it first."
2,Doesn't Come Close,"Any film that claims to be the successor to ""Rear Window"" had better live up to its billing; ""Disturbia"" unfortunately doesn't. Kale (Shia LaBeouf) is a young man who runs off the rails after his father's tragic death, and while under house arrest he starts spying on his neighbors, including the beautiful Ashley (Sarah Roemer) next door. Ashley and Kale's attention is soon drawn to the mysterious Mr. Turner, who mows his lawn incessantly but doesn't seem to do much else, and they become convinced he's a killer. The plot nods in the direction of ""Rear Window,"" but the resemblance ends as the violence escalates and bodies start appearing. The genius of ""Rear Window"" was the very ordinariness of the characters--Grace Kelly excepted, of course--creating the sense that behind every shaded window tragedy can occur. Here the outlandish plot and blood and gore quickly veer in the thriller/horror direction. Teenagers will love it, but anyone who's seen the real thing won't."
3,Two genres combined to produce a fair movie,"This film combines two types of films. Close to the first two-thirds is a story of a near 18 year old boy who had just lost his father in an automobile accident and who stuck a teacher and was given three months home detention by a judge. He meets a girl and a relationship begins. This large part of the film drags. It has the usual funny/silly sidekick, but he does little to add to the first story. The three begin to suspect that their neighbor is a serial killer and they spy on him. The second part is a thriller. It is well-done, but essentially little different than other films of this sort."
3,"Lively and fun, but not great","Disturbia takes a good while before anything interesting happens. Not that that is a flaw, but when we finally get to the good stuff, we find it's really not all that good. It is not suspenseful, and certainly not surprising. It is as predictable as you can get, yet I still found myself enjoying it.Perhaps it's because of the uber talented Shia Labeouf. He is a hugely capable young actor who conforms well to any role he plays. In Disturbia, you really get a sense of who his character is and you can't help but like him. He puts 100% into this film and I think that is why the film works as well as it does.I also really wish they used Carrie-Anne Moss more in this film. I really like her as an actress and would have loved to see more of her in this. All in all, a decent popcorn film, but not terribly thriller like or suspenseful. Also, the blooper reel is sadly lacking. It almost seems like a pointless tease."
3,The writers should be charged with theft,"I sort of liked this movie - a high school teen version of Rear Window. It's no classic but a good B movie.What irritated me, though, is the blatant plot theft perpetrated by the writers of this movie. They ripped off a little known made-for-tv movie called The Darklings. I understand being influenced or inspired by another movie or director, but come on. It's so similar that Disturbia should have been called The Darklings and touted as a remake.The writer of The Darklings should sue."
4,worth a look!,i bought this movie on blu-ray. it has exeptional picture quality and a very good movie as well. by the end of this movie you will be scared! definitely worth the price.
3,When will 2007 recover?,"It is funny the attitude we movie goers have taken to in 2007. Something as apologetically cautious as Disturbia is getting recognition. And do you want to know why? It doesn't really do much to make you dislike it. It doesnt do anything jolting either. It just plays it safe and goes on without trying too hard. And in my rather humored conscience, that is probably the only reason it was as successful as it managed to be.Learn from Alpha Dog, do watch this film but check out how much Alpha Dog had to offer and compare. Not a bad film, just underwhelming."
3,Pretty good,"Disturbia is a pretty good movie with a pretty decent plot and characters, although it was kinda predictable. But, despite being predictable, I enjoyed it for the most part. Nothing I'd own, but pretty good. -Trent Foreman, Author of Nightmare"
2,Unintensionally funny: peeping is a danger,"In places I don't think it wants to be funny, this movie is.It is almost a spoof of other paranoid classicswhere people imagine stuff about their neighborsand it turns out to be truein some strange way.A ""designed"" teenage ""so modern"" movie as well,with cell phones and gadgets galore.The teen female lead Sarah Roemer is the best part of the movie:the two adult actors should have known better,but I guess it is a pay check?One gag hits home : a burning bag of s**t."
5,I loved this movie,If you go into this expecting a slasher film with lots of gore you will be let down. There is something for everyone in this film from heart racing scenes to a little romance and some good laughs. Shia LaBeouf delivers a great performance (as he always does) but manages not to outshine the other very talented cast members. If you aren't a horror movie fan (like me) you will enjoy this film. I didn't see it in the theaters and refused to watch it at first but after watching it once I couldn't stop. This movie (in my book) is a must have!
3,disturbed?,"Not as disturbing as I'd hoped. The plotline is predictable and it isn't as thrilling or frightening as you'd like. Despite this flaw, there isn't a boring moment in the movie which is a huge credit to the director and the actors. It kept me watching. One of the best parts of the movie was the discovery of the young actor, Shia LeBeouf (impossible to spell!). I remember him in very small roles in big movies but he did amazingly well playing the male lead of the movie. Definitely an actor to watch out for."
3,"D.J. CARUSO, OPUS 4","**1/2 2007. Directed by D.J. Caruso. Another movie that wouldn't have existed if such movies as Alfred Hitchcock'sRear Window (Collector's Edition)or Woody Allen'sManhattan Murder Mysteryhadn't been shot before. So don't wait any originality in the screenplay. Ninety minutes of unfathomable vacuity but, after all, who cares ? Good direction and acceptable actors though."
2,Pedestrian.,"hitchcock comparisons are ludicrous. I thought the movie was a farce comedy, not a suspense thriller. I am still quite perplexed at the amazing reviews people are giving this. It was a dark comedy almost, to the point of it being juvenile, filled with adolescent angst and cakewalks through suburbia. I found the suspense sophmoric and the teenagers roles mundane and unremarkable. The accolades that people give Shia are unwarranted. How people can see this kid has an amazing career based upon his role in Disturbia is bordering on the ludicrous.A pedestrian film geared towards the myspace generation."
2,Weak,This may be appealing to teenagers...MAYBE. The story line was weak and typical....run of the mill. I did not find it to be suspenseful...mildly entertaining.
2,Nothing disturbing here... Move on!,"You can enjoy this movie if you're a 10 year old but since this is PG-13, it's not for those audiences. Gave it 2 stars because it's mildly funny but otherwise nothing interesting or suspenseful. Just the regular serial killer next door wrapped around a lame screenplay!"
3,Everything old is new again.,"This movie follows the same formula as the classic Hitchcock's,""Rear Window"", with James Stuart and Grace Kelly. They switched Mr. Stuart with a teenager, in trouble with the law and is confined on house arrest. He gets bored and starts looking out his windows at his neighbors with binocculars and believes he sees his neighbor kill his wife. You know the rest but I guess it was fun to see how they spin it. The updated cinematography is good but it will never replace the original, which I, personally, love. I think this version will never become a classic like the original; Stuart and Kelly were just too phenomenal, don't mess with perfection."
3,Dissapointing,"I saw this the opening day. The theater was nearly full. This movie was good, but not great. The acting was good. Shia LeBeouf is a really good actor, and David Morse was good too, so was Sarah Roemer, and Carrie Anne-Moss. This movie was just a teen remake of Hitchcock's Rear Window, which is a classic. This movie was dissapointing. The first half of the movie sucked. Lame, pointless, just to make it have a story. Until the last half did it finally get good. **Spoiler Beginning** This movie did have and exciting ending, and the kid did get the bad guy and the kids next door in trouble.**Spoiler End** This movie turned out to be okay if it weren't for the second half. I guess I'll probably buy it in the end some day."
4,GOOD LITTLE SUSPENCE/THRILLER RIDE !,"When this movie release in theaters, went box -office for almost the 2 weeks. I was wondering why? Till now saw this flick for first time on DVD, Real liked this movie , as exactly they says is like updated, ""Rear window"".I enjoyed it, Is like all in one, comedy & suspense real nice scripted and done.That dude `shia laBeouf' done the excellent job, ROCK ON DUDE. I never see him in any movies, But WOW, he done the hell of the job in this flick he just made & steal the show with his acting. Do have some few flaws in this flick, But defiantly check it out, Have a old fashion style with new life's of teenager these days with alots gadgets in hands. But after all , Edge of the seat suspense and laugh in some parts, all in one & nicely done. B"
4,Disturbia Review,This was a very good thriller. We had seen a small part of it on cable and wanted to watch the the rest. We recieved the movie very quickly and in good contidion.
3,Good OK teen date movie,I didn't care for the actor who played the lead. His portrayels to me were annoying and overdone.The movie was entertaining with a few funny scenes.
3,Average,"I found Disturbia a bit of a let down as I'd read alot of positive reviews about the movie, but after watching it, I thought it failed to reach any of the potential it had. Don't get me wrong, it isn't a terrible film and Iv'e seen far far worse; but, there films to be watched such as ""Zodiac"" which to my mind is where you would be better off spending your money."
4,Pleasantly Surprised,"I was afraid this was going to be a teen suspense type movie. It was actually pretty good. Shia LeBeouf did nothing but annoy me during every episode of his childhood show (I forgot the name) that my kids watched daily. He is a pretty talented actor now though. The girl in this movie is a bit of a ho-bag. I wouldn't be too proud of her character, if I were her parent."
4,"Rear Window All Over Again, Not Such a Bad Thing","Shia LaBeouf carries this film, that's a fact. I was never a fan of his, but after seeing Disturbia, I think he could make the transition to an adult acting star. He is convincing, smart, natural, and often amusing. David Morse seems to always play the same character and act the same in everything he does, but it works well here. He underplays the bad guy role and it makes it that much more creepy. Sarah Roemer, as one reviewer here mentioned, is strangely cute and sexy without having knockout looks. Her acting is very convincing as well.I really enjoyed how slow the movie developed, giving you ample time to get to know these characters. Rarely do PG-13 teen/horror movies have dialogue this fresh and characters this real.I like blood and guts movies (300 and Grindhouse for example) as much as the next guy, but Disturbia is a well made thriller that even kept a gorehound like me enjoying every minute of it."
2,Should have been a rental,"I bought this title after hearing peoples reviews, but I really wish I would have just rented it. If you've seen it once, there's really not much to go back for.The HD quality seems pretty good. I didn't notice anything to complain about.The movie itself is really not that great. Some of it is pretty fun, but other parts will have you groan. After the girl next door realizes that this guy's been spying on her, she says a line that pretty much made me want to get my money back.There is some decent suspense in this. The ending, however, is extremely disappointing, and doesn't even make any sense. The main antagonist goes completely against his character, and the whole thing has feeling of being rushed. It's the sort of thing where they only had 10 minutes left and figured they needed to do something.Rent it instead, or borrow it from the fool who bought it ;)"
4,Hitchcock,"I am not normally into this kind of movie, but I bought it as a gift for a friend who loves Alfred Hitchcock and all sorts of horror/suspense movies. He said that it is the closest thing to an Alfred Hitchcock movie he has seen in a long time. Very creative and suspenseful!"
3,DISTURBIA IN SUBURBIA!,"'Disturbia' is one of the those films that has that ""seen it all before"" feel to it. It does have a few thrills along with a good cast, but on the down side some of the characters do some really stupid things. Normally I can overlook some of this, but when it effects the authenticity of the story, it hurts the overall experience. It's worth a look but, rent it before you buy it."
2,The first two-third of the movie is interesting. The last one-third is disturbingly illogical,"The first two-third of this movie kept me glued to the screen. The last one-third of the movie was so disturbingly illogical it made me laugh.Let's say you were a teenager. You had just escaped from a murderer who had chased you and tried to kill you. Now you had two choices. One, you could run straight to the murderer's house where you thought your mom was held hostage to rescue her. Two, you could run to your neighbor's house to call police for help. What do you think a ""normal"" kid will do? The main character in this film selected choice number one. Not only he was able to free his mom, he also managed to kill the murderer too! Yeah right!However the picture is beautiful. The two main characters Kale and Ashley look hot. It's worth watching once."
1,Target Audience = 12 Year Olds,"This film is the result of having 3 untalented and unappealing teenagers attempt to carry an interesting film project. I watched the film with a handful of friends and the collective opinion was that lead actor Shia LaBouef must be related to SOMEONE important involved with the film because there is no other reason to have cast him as the lead. Fine talent such as David Morse is absolutely wasted here and the characters of LaBeouf's Mother, law enforcement officials, and all other adults are contrived from cardboard. The plot offers ho-hum 'thrills' only to the pre-adolescent set. SKIP IT!"
5,A THRILLER TO THE VERY END!,"I have been purchasing various HD DVD titles for my new Toshiba HD A2 DVD player. I was anxious to see this movie, so decided to purchase it on HD DVD. The movie itself was a nail biter from start to finish and did not cease to keep my attention for one minute. The acting was great, the musical score added to the intensity of the film, and the story itself was intriguing. As for the HD quality, it was equally impressive, with crisp, clear images and equally clear, crisp audio. I would highly recommend this DVD to anyone who loves a great thriller and for the HD quality as well."
4,Pretty Coool!!!!,"I enjoyed this movie, it kept me on the edge of my seat wondering what was going to happen next.It was a thrill ride even though it moved a little slow in some spots."
5,Great transaction!,Exactly what I thought I was getting and for so cheap!! Few small scratches but played like mint. Thank you!
2,I KNOW Hitchcock.......THIS is no Hitchcock!,"It is amazing how any of the previous reviewers can compare this competent, OK movie to the classic REAR WINDOW. I would call this mindless comparison just blasphemous.The only similarity in both of these movies is a house-bound man observing all his neighbors with his binoculars.This movie begins nicely and with a strong bang, with the flashback of the father dying in a car crash that almost seems intentional, (the future killer?). It continues to move at a nice pace, but it soon moves to the ridiculous stage, and later, to the all-too-predictable ending.Save your money, save your time, make some pop corn and watch REAR WINDOW once again."
4,Surprising good,"I didn't expect much of this film when it came on TV the other night - I thought it would be another pathetic teen movie and that would be it...but I can admit when I am wrong.Kale was a surprising sympathetic character considering his situation of being under house arrest. Ronnie, his best friend, was entertaining and full of life - Ashley was of course the drop-dead gorgeous girl next door (my only complaint, the cast were rather ""normal"" people next door - why couldn't they cast a normal sized girl instead of one who looks like a model?). But that was perhaps my only critism of the movie.It was well paced, creepy in places and even during the climax had me fixated on the TV screen. Sure the story may not have been all that original but it was nice to watch a movie without hearing offensive language in every sentence or with overused blood and gore.This was a smart movie (expect for spying with the lights on...hmmm) that deserves to be watched at least once."
4,"Good plot, and action.","When I ordered this film, I was really not sure it was my kind of film. I was surprised."
4,A real nail-biter!,"If you don't enjoy being nervous, don't watch this movie!The feeling of suspense and urgency was almost too much at times (in a good way!) as a teenager under house arrest begins to suspect that his neighbor is a serial killer.He proceeds to investigate in ways that make you yell at the television, shamelessy spying on his neighbor with binoculars and the use of his friends.I loved the tense moments throughout, and I also like the fact that I found myself unsure of what the real story was.Is his neighbor a serial killer? Definitely. Wait....maybe not. Wait...I think he is....Watch it and find out!"
4,Dragon America review,"This is a great read, especially for fans of Naomi Novik's Temeraire series. Having Daniel Boone and George Washington in the book made for interesting reading at times. The book is hilarious at times, but is shorter than the books I usually read.Unfortunately, the great fire-breathing dragons Daniel Boone uses at the end to help stop the British are more reminicent of Godzilla smashing through Tokyo, than anything from Dungeons and Dragons. All in all, it's a good book, but it could have been fleshed out more."
3,"beautiful,evocative illustrations unsupported by writing","A beautifully illustrated book and compelling story but theaccount is told too quickly, too many events mentioned but none in anydepth. The language is pretentious and gets in the way of the story. I use the book in the elementary school library where I work, to talk about creative nonfiction, but I have to stop contstantly to fill in details which the book leaves out and I change the words as I read. The actual events are so powerful - a shame the book doesn't convey this."
2,Too many inaccuracies,"Although the style of writing was good in this book, there were some glaring innaccuracies. For example, it states that the Lewis and Clark Expedition discovered a water passage to the Pacific. Actually, their greatest disappointment was that they were not able to cross the continent by water because of the mountain ranges they had to cross. Also, York did not pull Clark out of the ravine to save his life during a flash flood. By the time York reached Clark and his party, they were already safely out of the ravine. There were several smaller mistakes that might have been corrected with more research."
2,Doesn't fit Extra large luxury thermarest,"This sack was a suggested item when I purchased my Luxury Thermarest (extralarge), so I went for it in the hopes that it'd help protect my new purchase. Unfortunately, it's reeeeeally hard to get it to fit in this sake. Like, REEEEEALLY hard.I've given up trying. So, waste of money for me or anyone else with a Luxury Thermarest (XL) that they don't wanna shred trying to squish into this little bag."
1,"Bad, bad movie",It's been years since I have seen this; thankfully the details are finally fading from memory. This is a terrible movie of a spectacular book. I think at one time Paul Newman had his director's credit removed. He certainly showed no particular gift as a director in this movie; just a big star with a hatchet (no pun intended).
1,looks like bad lip syncing,I love this film but whoever synced the movie to DVD didn't notice the audio is about 2 seconds behind. Painful to watch.
5,"Read the book, above all. Don't miss the movie","Sometimes A Great Notion is easily the great novel of the 20th Century. Read it and savor an expression of the relationship between people and land that is unsupassed in all of American literature. The movie is wonderful. Newman understand the book, and took it on to be a part its joy, and transformative heartbreak."
3,Great Cast of Characters (but read the book instead),"It took me weeks to read all 628 pages of this book, all the time looking forward to seeing the film. On one hand, the cast was wonderful - especially Henry Fonda and Paul Newman, as father and son. The movie went a long way in capturing the feel of the fictional town of Wakonda, including the river and many of the secondary characters found within the book.However, it would be practically impossible for any group of filmmakers and actors to translate the magic found within the pages of this novel onto the silver screen. While I salute and commend the people behind this film, there was no reasonable way to include all the richness of the novel in a Hollywood film. Certain key elements of the book were left out of the movie (Lee and Viv's romance being an important section left on the cutting-room floor). All in all, a noble effort but flawed and lacking compared to the book."
3,True to life story,"This is one to see. Plus it was filmed in Toledo Oregon, where I am from. Its a great movie about a family living around the logging industry."
5,Great Movie,I think this is an all time classic movie that has been long overlooked. Paul Newman-what else needs to be said.
4,sometimes a great notion,watched the movie numerous times and still like it! Like some respondants idea of a DVD with additional footage. I' didn't read the book but I'm sure there is more good story to tell!
1,A DISGRACE TO STARSHIP'S NAME!!!,"I am a HUGE Jefferson Airplane and Jefferson Starship fan, and I like Starship a lot. And, I spotted this CD while browsing one day. I didn't buy it, but I did listen to samples. As soon as I heard it, I suspected this disc of containing remakes.And right I was! EVERY SINGLE SONG ON THIS CHEAP STARSHIP BEST OF IS A REMAKE! You can tell because on songs like 'Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now' Grace Slick does not sing!Overall, this is just an effort to earn some money. And, the sound quality is very poor.Do yourself a favor, and buy Jefferson Starship and Starship's installment in BMG's ongoing 'Platinum & Gold Collection' series. Those are the original versions, and the sound quality is excellent on both sets. But stay far, far away from this one.NOT RECOMMENDED."
5,Great album,"Im odd, I wear a cow's ass on my chest.Atom Heart Mother and Meddle were two of my favorites in highschool.Color is great, the print is excellent quality.I wish more shirts had print on the back, it should say something on the back.I like marmalade..."
5,Great Phone,"I wasn't looking for a MP3 Player or a digital camera, I just wanted a good phone that got good reception. This phone holds a charge and I get reception in places where I never could before. It looks good, too. I did get a small scratch on the front already, but I'm not always easy on my phones. I purchased a clear plastic case for the phone (from ebay), and I think this should protect it from scratches and breaks. All in all, I think this is a great phone for the price. I am very happy with my purchase."
1,"DO NOT buy, and DON'T use Verizon","I can not tell you the frustration i have had so far with my krzr k1m phone from verizon!Firstly, I can't use the phone's capabilities, they are disabled.Second, there is seemingly no ""back"" button when using the menus, you have to start over!I have been a Verizon customer for years now and my trouble started when I upgraded to this new phone and I am very dissatisfied with everything, their service, the phone.former verizon fan,Nate"
3,Didn't fit my camera,"This is a good case. I like mostly that it is cushioned and waterproof. It has a zipper only. It should have also a velcro for fast access (while the zipper is open).Anyway, my camera didn't fit in because the measures provided were not exact. I recommend you are very precise on this when buying one. Leave some extra space, or better buy it only in stores so you can measure your camera."
4,Performs as it should,"This is the perfect size for my small camera. It offers the protection you would expect at a minimal cost. I like the soft case so that i can fit it wherever. The front pocket is convenient for an extra battery. There isn't a whole lot of space for the strap and other accessories. If you're looking for something that holds extra cards and such, I'd recommend a larger bag."
5,Great for digital cameras,"I purchased two of these cases and they are nice quality and work great to protect my digital cameras. I feel completely comfortable throwing the case into my purse or beach bag and not worrying if my camera is going to be protected. The case is thick and seems sturdy... so far so good. It also allows for easy access to your camera, and even has a small pouch in the front for any small extras (battery charger, extra battery, even your ID or some money fit inside nicely). I would definitely recommend the cases to anyone. However, I did notice that there are different sizes being sold on amazon of what seems to be the same case. Make sure you are purchasing one that is the size you will need for your camera. I have two average size digital cameras and they both fit comfortably (with room to spare) in this case... I do not believe they would have fit in the smaller size case."
4,Does its job,"I bought this for a Sony Playsport video camera. It is roomy enough for that and a couple spare batteries. The zipper to the main compartment is a bit annoying because it's so long, but that is not a deal-breaker. Even when full, this case is small and covenient. It's a good buy."
2,ugly looking - don't buy it.,"This is ugliest looking camera bag, it looks ok from the web, but once I received it and open the package, it looks so ugly and i throw it away. It is not worth of the money."
5,Very pleased,"Item while small is ideal for my point & shoot camera, that I carry when the DSLR's are just not appropriate or available."
4,Fits my Lumix DMC-ZS7 perfectly,"Bought this for my Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS7 (DMC-TZ10 if you're outside the USA). Fits the camera perfectly. A couple of spare SD cards fit nicely inside the zippered front pocket, and the pocket that's covered by the velcro flap is perfect for a spare battery. My only wish is that the velcro flap covered the camera compartment, so I could leave the camera compartment unzipped and rely on a velcro flap for quick access to the camera rather than having to fiddle with a zipper. On the whole, though, definitely recommended."
4,Lowepro Ridge 30 for Canon S95 Camera,"This is a reasonable buy at under $10. I just got this for my new Canon S95. This case is a bit too big for my S95 but it makes it easier to take in/out the camera and I like it. Over long-term usage it should less scratches my camera. This case has enough storage space for a spare battery and memory card. The quality appears to be good and durable. It looks good and I like it that has zippers. It does fit in my jeans front pocket but it is not convenient but tolerable. I had a hard leather case before but I decided to give this a try and I am glad I did. Overall, this is a reasonably good camera case and I recommend it."
5,High quality case for my Kodak Zi8 pocket camcorder.,"This case seems like just the right size, and there are small zippered pouches for the remote & extra battery. Neat looking & high quality. Very softy lined inside to protect the camera lens & LCD screen."
1,"take me out back and shoot me, please.",I was played this by a friend. I was amazed. I'd never heard any music so offensive and meaningless. The vocals killed me- a must to avoid.
5,kick-ass cd that stands up to any !!!!!!!,"any fans of metallica/ ac-dc / j priest/ hard rock in general will freak over this one/ if you listen to tracks ""jury"" and ""medusa"" you get the down-right heavy guitar riffs that rocked then and now/youre love is allright has some ofthe cathiest leads in years/ i am an old fart who listened to them back then/ but i do buy and listen to the new bandsand music as well/ this one holds its own and can usually pick it uo with a cheap price/ it will grow on you quickly and stay in your cd player for awhile"
3,Not a book for beginners,"This is a good book for coaches and parents that know a lot about tennis, but if you are a parent looking for a book to help you with the basics, do not buy it. It does not help you with the basics, it does not have any photos or sketches -except for some cartoonish drawings- to help you with the drills, movements, position of your legs, arms, shoulders, etc.I am giving this book 3 stars because it may be usefull for coaches and kids that know how to play tennis, otherwise I would give it less than that."
1,Terrible quality!,"I recieved the book, but when reading it I found that half of the book has half the page cut off so half the page is white. Some sort of printing defect. The actual book (what I can actually read) is really good for teaching tennis but that can't make up for the defect, unacceptable"
2,"Casual introduction to tennis the activity, rather than the game.","I view this book a useful for kids who are being introduced to tennis, but won't necessarily ever play the game."
5,Good stuff,"Great product for the price. Helped me put on some weight in combo with some other stuff (jack3d and l-arginine). Serving is 4 capsuls but they are small compared to other amino acid suppliments - I once got pills that were so large you hand to cut them into 4 peices to swallow them, and a serving was still 4 capsuls. Overall pretty good product and there are 360 capsuls for pretty cheap."
2,You need a lot to equal Whey protein,"On 11/24/2012 I compared the L-Protein amounts in my Whey protein supplements to the AMINO complete ingredient list. Big difference, the Whey has substantially more of everything I am interested in except L-Ornithine. I will be ordering L-Ornithine from NOW foods or another manufacturer. When I saw the other recent post indicating you would need 40 pills to do the job, I had a big laugh. That is exactly what I told my wife this morning. The higher dosages are what Dr. Oz is recommending for G.O.A.L., 2000 mg combined."
2,Ummm.... NO,"Maybe I misunderstood what these do. It makes me eat... a lot. Also, these caps are HUGE and the serving size is between 4-6/day. That is a lot. I already take about 12 vitamins a day (necessity, due to gastric bypass), I can't add any more.The main reason I did not like them is because when I take them, I eat a lot; they make me hungry."
1,Pills are HUGE!,I REALLY thought that I was going to choke to death the first time I tried them. It got stuck inmy throat and I couldn't breath......The pills are just too large! I survived so i have never tried themagain!
1,cancer,I used to take amino acids because i was doing MMA and for energy I used it. Untill my doctor and trainer told me that amino acids cause cancer
4,Amino Acids (mg) per 4 Capsule Serving,"While the product advertises 120 or 360 caps, there are only a total of 30 or 90 servings, because the serving size is 4 capsules. NOW Foods Amino Complete: Essential Amino Acids and mg per 4 Capsule Serving:* L-Histidine 37 mg* L-Isoleucine 115 mg* L-Leucine 205 mg* L-Lysine 185 mg* L-Methionine 35 mg* L-Phenylalanine 72 mg* L-Threonine 141 mg* L-Tryptophan 37 mg* L-Valine 141 mgNon-Essential Amino Acids:* L-Alanine 135 mg* L-Arginine 306 mg* L-Aspartic Acid 246 mg* L-Cysteine 38 mg* L-Glutamic Acid 454 mg* L-Glutamine 200 mg* L-Glycine 167 mg* L-Hyroxypoline 44 mg* L-Ornithine 24 mg* L-Proline 179 mg* L-Serine 106 mg* L-Tyrosine 66 mgMy opinion is that while these amounts may not seem like much, if you have any minor amino acid deficiencies, this will help. If you have any major deficiencies, this may not be enough. Note: NOW may change their product any time, so the info in this review may be outdated at any time."
5,Good Price,I saw information about these amino acids on a show and wanted to try them out. My energy levels have increased after starting them.
3,it's fine,the pills are kinda large and the dose is 4 pills a couple times a day so you have to be able to tolerate that
3,"Very good for spiritual health, but lacks mechanics of fasting",The title lead me to believe that this book focuses on the mechanics of preparing for a fast and breaking a fast. I bought the book and spent half an hour skimming through it to learn about these two topics. I found nothing on preparing for a fast and only nine pages on how to break a fast. The testimonies about the spiritual and health benefits of fasting are VERY encouraging to help you engage in this discipline.
1,"Wonderful book for Christians, but...","I have no doubt that this book is extremely helpful to people who want help with fasting from a Christian perspective- however, for those of us who want information on fasting without biblical references, I have found other books that were far more helpful to me."
1,Save your money!!!!,"Not well written or informative. If you spend five minutes on the Internet doing a tiny bit of your own research, you will have learned more then spending money for this piece of garbage, in my opinion."
5,THE REAL DEAL,"I had been researching ways to ... um ... heighten my response (ahem!). Lots of writings promise the same greatresults, but - bottom line - THIS is the seminar that got me there. IT WORKS. There is a learning curve, but withpatience and practice, I picked up great abilities and have sensations that take sex to a whole new level. There'seven a support website (BBS & chat) where you can anonymously ask questions of the author and trade pointerswith other learners. Am I a satisfied customer? That is DEFINITELY the word!"
4,Becoming Felix,I liked this book. You'd like this book if you are a kid and either plays clarinet or live on a farm. It's about a kid that lives on a farm.
3,Looks Pretty-Acts Lazy,"I bought several of these ""crates"" because I liked the smaller versions in the coordinating colors. The size of the crate is wonderful, however it does not have firm sides like the smaller ones, and once filled with toys, tends to slump. Unless only using perfectly folded items (which your toddler will promptly unfold) the sides are not nearly stiff enough to actually hold the items likely to be stored in them-a better choice would be more of the smaller crates. (They do, however, seem to work well as a make shift laundry basket!)"
3,"Good Idea, Not So Sturdy","Just as in another review I read, these crates are great with the plastic lining for easy cleaning, size is perfect for under my coffee table, but the sides push outward once filled. If they had sturdy sides and held their shape, I would give 5 stars."
1,My mistake: reading this book,"Well, where to begin in my review of one of the most poorly written books I had the displeasure in reading. Let me first explain that the book was a gift and I only read it out of desperation on a long plane flight. First off, the sheer length can only be a testament to the apparent vanity of the author applauding his own cleverness, as he rambles on incessantly through pages of incorrect grammar, spelling errors, and contrived story line. Although this is ""true crime"" and the plot is based in fact, the book manages to lose any of the real life suspense or drama of the case and turns it into a narrative more predictable and less interesting than those concocted in a 6th grade creative writing class. Even the title reeks from maudlin undertones! That should have clued me in, it was my mistake when I brought this book with me on my flight."
4,SD Gundam Force is awesome!,"I bought this video game for my 9 year old son and he loves it. He says it's great because you can play as three different gundams and you get stronger the more you play as that character. Each character has his own style of attacks so you can choose which one you like. He says the controls are not that easy, but they are learnable. The graphics are great, in his opinion, and there is no speaking so subsequently there are no foul language (which I like.) He loves it and says any other gundam fan would love it too!"
4,It works,The cover seems to ward off most exposure problems for the early morning Florida dew. I have decided to utilize 2 medium sized bull dog clips to secure the cover at the wheel spokes to ward off strong wind and blowing sand. I would reorder the cover if necessary.
2,Blows off the bike just when you need it,"I was told that I had to take my expensive bikes out of the living room, and I have no garage, or other available room. So they went onto the porch. I wanted the nicest cover possible. This one is not as heavy as I expected for the price, and it has no securing strap or method to keep it tight to the bike (I am using one on my wife's 52 cm and another on my 58 cm bike). So they come off in any windy rainy storm - just when you want it to cover the bike from the elements."
2,"Too expensive, doesn't provide enough protection from the elements.","Bought two covers to cover two bikes we have to keep on our high-rise balcony. One cover blew off and was lost to the wind, so I replaced it and this time punched grommet holes in the bottom of the cover so I could secure it underneath the bike with carabiners. A few days later it rained - I took the covers off the day after to check on how dry the bikes were. The bikes' seat and handlebars were wet. Not soaking wet, but with enough beads of water to make me realize that these covers are not waterproof. I don't recommend for anyone looking to keep their bikes outdoors and exposed to the elements. The material is very thin and flimsy. If you are looking to keep dust off your bike while keeping it in the garage, this would probably do the trick. It does look nicer than most bike covers, but I wish I went with a tarp for my situation."
1,way too small,I have a standard 26' adult bicycle and this cover is too small. I can' imagine it will fit any adult bicycle.
3,Too small,"Kept slipping up and off. I have a small to medium sized Trek bike and this covered only three quarters of the wheels. Not enough for outdoor storage, the wheels and gears would get dust and grit. Also I needed to turn the front wheel sideways so as to fit in my small area and that would also cause the front cover to slip up and off the front wheel. The picture shows it covering the entire bike to the ground. That's what I wanted but did not get. This cover might be OK for indoor or in-the-garage additional protection."
4,decent bike cover,"I found this cover to be inexpensive but effective. Unfortunately, I had to take off my aerobars though. I would love to see a tri-bike version made available!"
4,Great for my husband's bike!,My husband bought this to cover his bike in our shed during winter. He loves it! IT is a very nice quality cover and you can't beat the price.
3,"Overall pretty good, some improvements needed.","This bike cover is well made, folds into a compact case and fits well over my bike (I'm over 6ft tall and have a large bike). Worked well and kept my bike dry during an overnight rain storm.This product would be better if it had some Velcro straps to attach to the wheels to hold it in place and some loops on the bottom edge to run a lock cable through. The zippered pouch could be a bit bigger to make it easier to stuff the bag into when storing it."
5,Highly Recommend this product.,"I have a total of 3 of these covers that I use on my road, mountain and hybrid bikes. They are an excellent product that hold up well in the rain and high humidity that we experience in Jacksonville, FL. It's been 7 months since I bought the first one back in June and it is showing no wear. Excellent product. The only negative I can think of is that the cover for the hybrid doesn't cover all of the wheels. It leaves 4 inches from the ground up... front and back exposed. Otherwise the road and mtb versions cover 100% of the bike."
2,ehh. choose something else,"If you plan to keep your bike covered while in the garage to keep the dust off, then this is fine. If you want this as an outdoor covering for more than a few months, then just buy a tarp. This thing covers the bike well enough, (although the wheels keep popping out) it can't hold up to frequent use. Mine has already ripped in many spots, and the sun has weakened it alot. Not so good for an outside cover. If the sun is going to destroy it anyway, save a bunch of money and just get a tarp. May not look as nice, but this doesnt either after a few months outside. Final word...Boooooo!!"
1,Too small,"I wish I'd listened to the reviewer who said the bike cover was too small. I have a women's ten-speed touring bike, and the cover is almost impossible to get over both wheels. It's a long struggle and when it's finally covering most of the bike, it's so tight that the stitching pulls away from the fabric. Even so, it's an attractive cover and it seems well made, so I'd buy another if they added a couple of inches to the length. This one, however, will have to go back."
5,I Love These Things,"I've been putting Mee Tu Chinese Noodles in my soups for years. They hold up pretty well and add a lot of flavor. Since soup at dinner is usually not enough to hold me til breakfast the next day, adding these helps bulk it up. Anyway, they taste wonderful and make a great snack. I buy them by the case from Amazon because it really saves me money. Also, my local stores frequently run out of them, so this way I know that I'll have some on hand."
3,"Interesting story , but way too long and drawn out","This book was about two half-sisters with lots of rivalry and distain for one another along with their individual love of horses. One sister had her dad in the home while she was growing up and the other was his ""love child"" with a past mistress who grew up in a different state and saw her dad only occasionally. When the dad unexpectedly passes away, the sisters are brought together due to these circumstances and lots of drama, twists, turns, ensue. I gave the book only three stars because the author went overboard on the subject of horses. Towards the end, I thought ""if I hear where Arabian horses originated and how they should be bred one more time....."" !!! The rivalry and all-encompassing hatred between the sisters also tended to be much to long and drawn out."
1,The worst customer service I have ever experienced.,"""Vic"" in L'artisana customer serivce department identified himself as the owner and President of the company. He verbally abused me on the telephone, not only screaming at me but using foul language. NO product is worth being abused when a customer calls about an order being wrong - when I called about my latest order that was shorted on the number of items ordered as well as items that I did not order. Absolutely the WORST customer service."
2,Does not bond well with plastic as advertised,This did not bond as well with the plastic as some other brands I have tried.After several days of drying it still easy scrapes off in the corners.
5,Absolutely awesome,"After reading this book, I bought five more to give to my friends and family members who are constantly unhappy with their lives. This book made so much sense to me, there are some fundamental rules that each person should live by. When people live a life with out purpose or when they don't know their passions, then life can be very confusing. I love the way the author is written this book, she is talking to you as you are a friend and her advices are very real and accurate. I answered all the questions that she had asked in the book and it was awesome, I got to remind myself of the entire thing I knew that I didn't do anymore. Absolutely awesome!"
3,No.,"Unnatural dialog (does anyone actually say things like ""Delightful, utterly delightful!""? According to Madeleine L'Engel, yes. Yes they do.) The characters barely feel real. A slow book with random parts that are slightly interesting.It also strays too far from A Wrinkle In Time. Mr Murray has ""tesseracted"" all over the place into different dimensions in A Wrinkle In Time, and yet he has a hard time believing that Polly went back 3000 years."
3,A dissapointment,As a fan of L'Engle I was looking forward to an Acceptable Time. All the other Murry books had been fun and interesting and I thought that an Acceptable Time would be up to their quality. Unfortuanatly it's not. At times it is interesting but overall the book as quite boring at times and fails to draw the reader in like the others have. The characters are good but seem less human than some of L'Engle's other books and are not as endearing. An Acceptable Time is worth reading if you are a fan of the Murry books but nothing more.
3,Not as good as some of her other work.,"Normally I would probally absoloutely love this book, but I didn't. I was dissapointed because it did not meet the high expectaions I had by reading some of L'Engle's other books. Altogether, not such a bad read, but definately not one of the best."
4,It is an intriguing metamorposis thru time...,"This book is interesting. It is well written and is in a group all on its own from L'Engle's other books. This time, we go with Polly O'Keefe on a journey to a past time in history where she is captured by the people across the lake. It has an interesting plot to it and is a nice read."
5,I loved it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"It is the best of all the murry family series and I love how the two families of the Austins and Murrys colide. I read it during a study of the stone age in England and I think it coencides perfectly. I do not like the Austin family series but this makes me want to read more of their books. I love it, or did I already say that..."
5,Definitive Chronicle Of The Top 40 Era on Radio,"As an alumnus of a McLendon station, KELP, El Paso, Ben's book brought back the memories of decades past. Seriously researched and accurate, this is THE book of what TOP 40 was, who invented it, why it was a huge success and what happened to the stations and people who were involved. A ""must read"" for anyone who ever worked in radio or has an interest in the media. Also, it's great fun!"
2,If you like baseball cards...,"Ok, so I'm the party pooper here, but I'm not enjoying this book (still reading). What bother me about it is it's tunnel-vision focus on DJs (names, dates, station IDs etc.) while zilch on the music (how tunes were selected, politics, label preferences, payola, etc.). I'm personally curious why Top 40 has changed from period to period and how decisions were made behind the scenes out of hearing range of the listening audience. Telling us things like ""Bill Balance, who had been at KFWB for three years when Blore blasted in to install the Top 40 format in late 1957"" doesn't even pretend to discuss the kind of details I'm interested in. The publishers would have been more truthful if they'd named the book something like ""The People Who Played the Hits."" Also disappointing to me because I've read many Fong-Torres articles over the years that I've thoroughly enjoyed. If I change my mind as I read on, I'll revise or append this review."
3,"""Stand by. It's time for Your Hits of the Week!""","I can still hear Peter Tripp of NYC's WMGM (1050 on the dial) utter that phrase. That's just what this book is about: Rock 'n Roll DJ's. Not bad, but for me it was strictly pick & choose, as I only cared about those that I used to listen to."
3,A Snoozer,More like an encyclodia I could not really follow it inspite of my long term interest in radio.
2,This collection was apparently redone by the artist.,"I love Tommy Edwards but this cd is apparently one of those cases like Chubby Checker that Tommy rerecorded his songs at a later date,you can defiately tell the difference from the original masters and these,be ware.look for the original label stuff it will save you alot of anger."
5,Best Plugs,I have been using NGK V-Power plugs in my vehicles since 2005 and have never had 1 problem. I will continue to use them until they stop making them. And hopefully that doesn't happen.
2,Bit of a dud,"Bit of a dud from an author whom I normally really like. Nothing really bad about it, just kinda boring especially with a plot line about a heroine who is about to marry a guy only to find out that she and his brother shared a one night 5 years earlier. That should have had all kinds of angsty possibilities. But I struggled to finish."
2,Umm...just okay.,"I think that there were too many plot lines going through this book to make it a really great one: a one-night stand, the attraction to her fiance's brother, the supernatural plot line, the tension with her father & the reason behind it, her friend/boss's hidden attraction to one of the main characters, the reason behind the hero's reluctance to return home & the reason there's tension between him and his family. The author attempted to wrap up the loose edges of all the plot lines with her epilogue but I felt like a lot of it fell through the cracks. There was no mention to her fiance about the one night stand with his brother 5 years ago, the attraction of her friend/boss would have made a greater secondary story, and I feel that the main character didn't resolve anything with her father. Overall, worth reading once but not one for the keeper shelf."
2,Bulk=No instructions.,"I ordered this to replace a broken one. I read the product inforation before placing my order to make sure it was compatible with my system, but it didn't work when I got it. I'm knew to this, but I'm guessing bulk means not boxed up and no instructions. It would have been nice to be able to double check something. The bad part of doing a refund is that I don't have a printer, but Amazon was great with refunding everything."
2,They have done better....,"Sadly, the first album ""NAKED"" is still not on cd yet. That was a great pre-industrial 80's album filled with bizzare songs, odd lyrics, and great musicianship. ""My Broken Body"" and ""Big Man Restless"" were the stand out tracks.Altough this album is slick and commercial...it lacks the charm they once had. ""Certain Things Are Likely"" is a good tune, but not great, and the rest of the songs just don't stick in your head. This recording spawned three 12 inch singles. I can't remember which ones but one single had a song called ""Footsteps"". .....How can I follow in these footsteps so large...each ones a monster and it's always in charge...And a another single ha a song called ""Michael"" which was a snappy synth bass driven song about a sailor going to war. Too bad KTP didn't fill the album with songs like those two. Then the album would have been great!"
3,good,"Good pop album, but nothing more. 'Naked' (now available on cd) and 'What Noise' (1984) are far better efforts. The later, by the way, includes above mentioned songs 'Footsteps' and 'Martin'."
1,"the water leaks to control panel, broken motor","I bought 3 of these for my business, after one year, one has water leaked to the control panel => stop working. Other has broken motor."
4,Great Machine but High Cost,"As a mobile food service provider my blender is one of the most important tools, this 91603 is awesome. The ability to program this unit is far above other comprabable machines. I was a little sceptical about the Jar Pad sensor (thought I might have to bypass it) but it has proved to work well. I also use machine to do prep work and the blades are excellent for cutting, chopping, etc."
5,Informative and Yummy!,This book has been a sanity saver. I recommend it to anyone with a wheat intolerant child. It is very informative and the recipes are great!
2,Disappointed!,"I have a 4-year-old with celiac disease, so I was excited about this book. Unfortunately, when it arrived I discovered that the recipes didn't offer me as many new and different things to try as I had hoped. (I already own 4 other gluten-free cookbooks.) I tried the Breakast Muffin recipe. It was okay. Nothing special. If you don't own any gluten-free cookbooks already, this one may be good for you. Two things really bothered me. First the bread machine recipes never stated the size loaf you were making. I assume 2lb, but that's important info to leave out. Second, I felt that some recipes were included just to fill pages. One page is a recipe for a baked potato. The resources in the back are quite helpful, but you could easily find them other places."
3,Ok live CD,This CD does not compare to seeing these guys in concert. It is very rough and the band indicates it was not a good night. Lots of profanity and a very rough sounding recording.
4,Diamond in the Rough,"Russ Glenn's simplistic artistry cuts through the over-dubbed,electronically layered world of pop music. His rich insights into life on songs like Flagstaff and Truth & Consequences make his messages live in the universal flow of human experience.Russ' ability to 'master' the moment and capture the live feeling in one cut in a recording studio usally reserved for endless hours in takes, re-takes, and massive engineering edits make it a perfect fit for those who appreciate what can and does happen at an intimate live performance by an approachable, personable artist.I will definitely be sharing copies of this with my friends!"
3,Not all the hits...,"Well, well, well. What is it with ARS that it's so hard to get satisfaction when it comes to a ""Greatest Hits"" collection? Unlike many other discs, which offer at least TWO different rerecordings of ARS tracks, this one does contain the originals, just the way you remember 'em. BUT-- and this is one big but-- incredibly, this one manages to omit (arguably) the biggest hit, ""Imaginary Lover""!! Doesn't make a whole lot of sense, right? Especially since two other songs come from the same album! Hmmm.The ""20th Century Masters"" collection is the one I'd get. Funny, because I usually find that series unsatisfying. Go figger."
4,Very informative easy read,I found this book to be very informative and easy to read. Would recommend having it in every household as a reference to formulate intelligent questions for an attorney. Thanks.
2,Paid too much,"I think I paid too much money for this cd and it skips on my cd player in my car. It skips on two songs. It looked like it was used quite a bit, not hardly used. Now I am leary of buying used cds."
1,Hey You is classic heavy metal but that's about it,A so so band from the 70's. A better album to get is the BTO greatest hits Cd which also contains hey you as well as You aint seen nothin yet.
3,Disappointed in the condition of this used album,I purchased this to replace one I had 40 years ago and when I played it for the first time I was disappointed with the quality of the sound. I am and have been a Haggard fan for many years. A week to 10 days after this one came in I found my original and there was no compairison to this one and mine. Mine played like it was made yesterday and the quality difference was immediatly appearant. My album cover wasn't faded like this one either.
3,Does the job,I got this bucket for some home parties and it does the job. It's not a super sturdy restaurant grade tool but it does its job for a great price. It looks expensive but if you tug on the decorative rings I think they will definitely give. So far so good. I would definitely recommend this bucket for the price. It's just an ice bucket.
4,Elegant and convenient,"A very nice and elegant ice-bucket, looks sturdy enough, right size to contain one bottle, and is reasonable priced. An ideal bargain. I highly recommend it."
2,Misleading description,"I purchased this wine bucket solely because the description showed its shipping weight as 5.7 pounds. When it arrived the package seemed very light and turned out to be 1 pound 12 ounces. This wine bucket is very light and thin stainless steel, nowhere near the weight advertised. Nevertheless the design is satisfactory and I assume it will fulfill its function. The price is right."
5,"Well Designed,Convenient,Attractive","I got this stainless cooler because I didn't have to polish it before taking it to the patio to drink champagns with the neighbors, It's attractive,holds plenty of ice to cool my champagne and I don't have to be constantly polishing it. It's also light weight and easy to carry."
4,"A really good, fast paced read","so glad I discovered John Gilstrap. I have now read 3 of his books and I am going back to try to read them in order. Fast paced, well crafted and fun...."
4,NATHAN'S RUN,NATHAN'S RUNthe story is suspenful right to the very last page. Nathan is a troubled youg man. Just like the the troubled young man in Sandy Hook.
2,Slow but sure,"I was looking at the book reviews on all books and this one had some really good reviews. I found the book slow, very heavy handed and the character development quite poor. The last 3 pages were really good but otherwise the book was terribly slow. I just can't understand all the good reviews for such a slow book...sorry !"
5,Nathan's Run is a Runaway Winner!,"Having mistaken John Gilstrap for John Grisham, I thought I give Mr. Gilstrap a try. It was worth it because I feel like I was inside the book. I highly recommend this book."
2,Interesting but empty,"Okay, the book has one thing going for itself: Nathan thugs at your heart. He's your favorite burglar. He's innocent, he's small and defenseless and the whole world seems to want him dead. You can't but hope he'll outsmart everybody. But let's be honest: Gilstrap took the cheap way out. The book might be a page-turner, but he acomplishes it on the expense of his main character, Nathan. There is nothing real about the character. Nathan is the result of a simple question: How can I make a character that everybody likes and roots for immediately? So Gilstrap may win our sympathy, but he sells out the story. There's nothing behind it. It is what the title suggests - it is Nathans run, and nothing more. Which is fine, I guess, if you read it only for the thrill, or the entertainment, but I believe it could have been more."
5,"Well written, compelling and impossible to put down","I read Gilstraps new book first and went back to find Nathan's Run. Once started, I could not put it down. Some parts were implausible but with literary license, that's what fiction is all about. The only part that left me hanging was the end. It just stopped. Seems to me that one more chapter explaining the trust fund, who finally ended up with Nathan and slowly easing out the characters or killing them off would have been more logical. I actually checked to see if part of my book was missing. However, it was great and I would recommend it to anyone that can handle graphic language and action. His new book is even better and recommend it also."
5,suspense-filled book!,"Read this many years ago in a weekend. Then proceeded to read al John Gilstrap books. Was not disappointed. Reaif you like John Grisham and James Patterson, you will like Nathan's Run."
5,Unforgettable,"When this thriller was translated into German, it was a very different kind of book. The first of it's kind (or one of the first) that had a 12 year old hero.Of course some scenes are a bit disturbing, but we watch similar scenes in most movies or on TV and accept it, so why not in a book? Times are changing.I re-read this book several times and recently gave it to my husband on his birthday and can't wait to hear his opinion about it.Wish they would make a movie about ""Nathan's Run""."
5,Nathan's Run,"Excellent story, narrated by George Guidall, who does an excellent job of narration. One of the best recorded books and even though I first heard it when it came out in the 1990's, I just listened to it again and was enthralled, making a long road trip feel much shorter. This is a must listen selection. I highly recommend it!"
5,If I could only jump inside those pages...,"This book was fantastic...and heart wrenching...and so unbelievably suspenseful! I loved it!Nathan won my heart in this one. I wanted to jump through the pages of the book and help him! I would have if I could have!At only 12 years old, Nathan is on the run...from everyone, including the law. As I read and ran right along side Nathan, I shared his journey and his experience. Little Nathan showed me the heart and the courage of a lion! I was so touched by him.Just one warning, Nathan shares with the reader a rough and dark history that is hard to read and imagine. But, it is well worth it. This story was just incredible!Five stars!"
4,"Go Nathan, Go!","Nathan's Run is a very good thriller about a 12-year old boy who escapes from a youth detention center after killing a guard in self-defense. (Or was it self-defense???) In an ordinary thriller, the author would follow a formula that the reader would probably be able to easily figure out. That doesn't happen here. Gilstrap gives us just enough information to keep us turning the pages to find out what happens to Nathan next. All is not as it seems in Nathan's life. Anxious to tell someone his story, Nathan telephones a national radio talk show. Improbable? Maybe. Maybe not. But it is suspenseful and riveting.Nathan's Run may not be for everyone. There's lots of violence and profanity, but there's also quite a lot that Gilstrap has to say about our society and where we're headed. Also Nathan is one of the most unforgettable characters in adult fiction. A good read, but not a great ending, thus earning four stars instead of five."
2,Disappointed,"I waited for this book to come out for several months. I was disappointed in it, thinking it was going to be a great thriller. I found it to be predictable and a little dull."
1,I left this one on the park bench,"I couldn't get past Gilstrap's shallow characterizations. All he seemed to use to describe anybody were four-letter words. I wonder how large his vocabulary really is. I think I'll go find the Readers Digest version, the F- word omitted, and the plot condensed. That ought to be a nice afternoon read, then instead of leaving it on the park bench, maybe I'd pass it along to a friend."
1,... aimed at young people,"My sixth grader came home with this book. It was found in his school library with a Reading Level of 6.7. He told me the book contained a lot of inappropriate words. I immediately looked at the book and in 10 minutes found a huge array of offensive, sexually explicit, and morally offensive words. There was no warning of the mature nature of this book on the cover or the reviews inside. THIS IS NO CHILDREN'S BOOK. I have currently asked the middle school to review the book and send it on to an audience where it would not influence such young children. Not my kid, not my school, NO WAY! (By the way, he did not finish the book.)"
2,"Society Haters, Unite! You have a new champion.","I sincerely hope this first book is also the last one by this author. A 12-year old car thief, burglar, and (?) murderer (?) is its ""hero"". The author gave away his leftist leanings when he stated in the blurb that this is a book about ""the war our society wages against its children"".So, don't jail them, provide them with the means to kill; whether it is with a Glock for drive-by shootings or a shank into a drunk's gut, never mind. After all, it is society that is at fault, never the non-existing parenting, or the teachers who are afraid to go to school because they will be blamed for their charges' rotten behavior, the teachers who get killed and raped by these misbegotten poor little sweethearts. Yech.... stay away from this garbage and keep your money."
5,unique train,"This is a very cute train from the thomas the train sets, the top wheel even turns with the bottom wheels, my son loves it and he enjoys playing with it, as it is die cast metal, I am sure it will last for many years to come."
4,For a Wedding,It was 17 years since i last played organ for a wedding. The arrangements Trumpet Voluntary (Jeremiah Clarke) and the Bridal Chorus were both simple enough for me to manage yet advanced enough to sound impressive.
5,We All Need Grace To Make,"I have taken and taught several Kay Arthur studies. She has a wonderful way of helping you learn what God has to say to His people by teaching you how to find it out for yourself. ""Lord I Need Grace To Make It"" is a perfect Bible study for both new believers and those that have believed for many years. I am currently teaching this study to a group of about 20 women and have witnessed such enthusiasm as they discover and better understand the grace given to them by a holy God. I would recommend getting the CD or DVD's that go with the book."
5,Great teapot,"Bought this for my husband as a gift after reading all the great reviews. The lid arrived chipped, but Old Dutch replaced it immediately (they have great customer service!). My husband loves this teapot and makes tea in it at least three times a week. The tea stays warm for a long time and this teapot holds a lot of tea. I had looked at lots of teapots before buying this one, many of which were three or four times what this one costs, but this teapot's quality for the price really stuck out to me. We have had the teapot for a little over six months and still love it."
3,disappointed,"i ordered this thinking it was Moss green in color, but when it arrived it was black. i tried to send it back, but found that it was not possible through amazon. i ended up keeping it, but will be much more cautious when ordering from your affiliates in the future. i will not be giving it as a gift which i purchased it for, because it is much too masculine for the person intended for."
3,Not the greatest,"This does not seem like a quality teapot. I suppose the price point is fairly good for something of the likes. I used it for a couple weeks and noticed my tea just tasted off... I believe it is the coating inside the pot. However, I am more particular with my tea than most people I think. I went ahead and returned it."
1,unity teapot enamel flakes off,"Purchased this teapot on December 24, 2011. Very disappointed. Although it is of nice design, after using it for 10 months the enamel is flaking off. The pot is rusted. I never used it on direct heat. Totally unusable. Would like my money back."
2,Too Much Surface Area - Does not retain heat.,"Here's the honest scoop on this teapot. This teapot has too much surface area for a tetsubin cast iron teapot. The result is the tea gets cold very quickly - even if you use a tea warmer with a candle. Since I like my tea hot, this was a very poor choice.Subsequently I replaced this with a Iwachu Japanese Iron Teapot at more than double the cost. If you really want a pleasant tetsubin teapot experience --- go with the Iwachu --- because it keeps the tea at the perfect drinking temperature and with care it will last a lifetime."
4,Beautiful Product Delivered in Perfect Condition,Bought this as a gift. It is so beautiful and useful we may get one for ourselves. The one we bought is green. Very nice product. We are not second guessing our decision to buy this over the others.
1,Black enamel dissolves into tea--gross!,"I was REALLY happy when I got this teapot--although it looks small, it actually holds a lot of tea, it's beautiful, and it certainly seemed durable.Unfortunately, even though I washed it before I used it, black enamel was showing up in my tea--it tastes bad (like solvent or paint) and it can't be good for you. I was hoping that this was just because it was new, but I've had it almost a month now and it still makes my tea ink-black and disgusting. I'll be returning it--bummer!"
3,Nice looking but not practical for tea lovers,"I love good tea and have a pot going all day long. My china pot broke and found this one at Amazon and loved the color. It's very heavy and with my arthritis, I have a hard time picking it up and since the spout is placed in such a way one has to hold the pot perfectly upright until it reaches the cup or else it drips out. Even though it's cast iron, it doesn't keep tea warmer longer. The two things I do like about it is it has a strainer for loose tea and the color fits in with my kitchen. It's well made and I just know it will never break so I'm stuck with it."
2,"Nice looking, but arrived damaged","Item arrived inside a box with other items I ordered at the same time, and the exterior box did not appear damaged; however, when I pulled out the box with the teapot, I found that the lip of the spout was broken off."
3,Heaven's Gate Cult,"This was hard book to read as I had a friend that was a member. She died in 1997 with the group. How people can follow a man as crazy as he was, is beyond me. The book didn't go deep enough into why the people believed as they did. How could anyone think he could lead them to Heaven? The book started off good, but fell short of details. Wish there had been more details about each of the people that died."
2,Pretty bad-> Mostly just an advanced English text,If I had wanted a text on grammar or rhetoric I thinkI would have bought one. Only toward the end with Noam Chomskyand the psycholingistics articledid I get some of what I had expected or hoped for in this text.I think I had better coverage of these subjects in my high school English texts and the style sheet my first year college English teacher made us read.The Elements of Style
3,Just read some.,"the book is useful, and offers some practical information on its subject. much of the information is helpful for the novice teacher I just said this book is better than PLLT not the best one. when I was a university student I hate PLLT class because I was taught useless things, i'm not complain about my teacher but subject. I just need more practical exam."
3,Decent enough movie,"This is a pretty decent movie. Certainly not one of the greats, but okay. I would certainly consider it a worthwile rental, but not necessarily for purchase. The two gay brothers are cute, if a bit stereotypical Italian men. I probably would have liked it more if it wasn't yet another story about closeted men and their absolute desire to make their dad happy at the cost of their own."
5,Amazing! A true family movie!,"This a fresh breath of air in the genre of gay cinema. Too often we are left with cliche movies about the gay ""scene"" and we don't see films like this reflecting real life experiences of coming out to family and friends. I can't think of anything I hate or even dislike about this movie. The camera work was superb. The setting was amazing. The actors and actress' brought these characters to life which shows their skill and talent. I was convinced that everyone was who they portrayed. Even the ""eye candy"" was shown with grace and style and never overpowered the story or scene. The comedy woven into the story was perfect. As a gay man I would proudly show this to anyone I know even the ones who don't necessarily support the gay community. There is nothing overwhelming in it that I should cause any concern for those wanting to show this to a younger or teenage audience. Can't wait to see more films by this talented crew!"
5,The Best One Yet!,"Bravo for Barbara Delinsky. A Woman's Place captures the real-life trauma one woman faces when her world falls apart. This book is smart, thoughtfu, realistic and, for me, portrayed each character with balance and tolerance. I was struck particularly by the main character's strength and how she was able to negotiate and survive one of the most difficult experiences a woman can face. As a reader, I felt her horror and her confusion; this is the sign of a well-crafted and successful book. I heartily recommend A Woman's Place and look forward to Barbara's next book"
5,Very well written and appropriate for the late 1990's,"I thought that A WOMAN'S PLACE was very well written and timely. One of Delinsky's few books that did not have a ""happy"" ending in the sense of all's well that ends well. Its ending of compromise reflects the compromises that most of us have to make today. Things don't always work out the way we want them to and we don't always do things as well as we would like. The book made me think about the changing roles of women within the family dynamic. The setting, especially the introduction of the lighthouse, was excellent and the story was riveting. The smallest details picked up the nuances of everyday family life and the book was very realistic as well as being a great story"
3,"Written well enough, but mediocre","Self-made successful heroine is the owner of a chain of basket stores, happily married (she thinks) with 2 young children. Her world falls apart when her husband files for divorce, tries to milk her for all she has and take custody of the kids too. See how strong woman picks herself up and conquers all. Usual stuff. Written well enough, but an old plot with nothing spectacular to lift it up from mediocrity. One point it its favor, I was able to finish the book. They are not bad, but I don't collect Delinskys."
2,surprised,"It seems like everyone here enjoyed this novel, but I found it horrible! It was so boring. Unfortunately, it was the only book I had with me at the time so I tried to read about 4 chapters of it and it was painful. That was the last Delinsky novel I ever picked up."
4,A Woman's Place by Barbara Delinsky,"A Woman's Place is a rather dark and disturbing story of spousal abuse and discrimination in our legal system. As always, Barbara Delinsky has created a gripping story with strong characters you either love or despise."
3,An Off-Broadway Display,"Love and relationships are always the subjects of shows in every media, and this musical is no different. The lyrics are witty and fun, as well as touching and sometimes moving. However, the orchestrations get a little too repetative and dull. This isn't the most exciting thing to listen to, but it is a nice one to listen to every now and then. Its FULL of ballads but even that gets a little tiresome. So I think that this is one for people who like musicals but arent too picky about what they like. It is not for the Webber or Sondheim fans, this would put you to sleep. But overall I think its a nice CD to have. Favorite song ""Sweet Words Don't Scare My Lady"""
1,Skip This One,"This book is an abridgement of an (I surmize) 19th century translation of the Zohar, none of which is mentioned in the introduction. S.L. Macgregor Mathers seems not to have comprehended his text very well, had a predilection for jargon (i.e. macro- and micro-prosopus, and arcanum instead of English words) and pseudo-archaic language. The Zohar can be mystifying enough if translated clearly. This is a mystification of mystification."
4,Travel charger,From date that I received the charger it has worked well. I have had no problems with it. The travel charger has been everywhere with me.
5,Stride Rite Scooter,"My son has a very FAT foot, which requires him to wear an XW. Stride Rite is one of two brands that he can wear. I got these shoes at an unbeatable price ($42 marked down to $14). These shoes are so cute and are very flexible. This is a nice feature since I bought them while DS was still trying to walk, so when he crawled it didn't interfere w/ him much. I highly recommend these shoes to anyone who is looking for a good, long lasting shoe."
4,Stride Rite Shoes at a Wal-Mart Price,I love the product. My special needs child has been wearing Stride Rite shoes for years at a much higher price. The only complaint is that I had to get a different color and the pink ones sold out. My child does not know the difference and all is good. I purchased 2 pair for less than 1 pair at the store.
1,Total Failure,It came on two CDs and you eventually discover that the second CD holds the software which is needed to fix the bugs on the first.You also need a graphics card or equivalent.I do not have the graphics capability so although it appeared to load it would not run.I shall give it away or bin it.
5,fearless in her criticism,I knew Delia Aguilar at the University of Connecticut and found her to be fearless in her analysis of women and society --it is always worthwhile reading what she has to say.
2,What they do not tell you..,"What is not disclosed is this (is probably) volume 4 of the 7 volume set (volume 3 is in two parts: A & B). Volume 2 (I think) is next to impossible to find, and volumes 4 and 5 are tough to find."
3,A bit dishonest,"Georges Boudarel did more than ""reside in Indochina before and after the departure of the French"". He was a communist who was intimately involved in the interrogation and brainwashing of French POWs, if their accounts are to be believed, and many specifically name him. One cannot fault his history, his knowledge of Hanoi, nor his intimacy with Vietnam and the Vietnamese Communist Party. One can wonder why his country has never held him to account, and hauled him before a richly deserved firing squad."
5,Magnificent volume of knowledge,"This is a ""must own"" book for anyone in the pest control industry. Each chapter is filled with useful insights and sound practical knowledge. Nearly ever facet of pest control concievable is covered by a host of world wide authorities. The collection of contributing authors is superior...every one is a legend in his own right. Note: this is a HUGE book, it is a little cumbersome to hold. Perhaps when the 9th edition is released it will be a two-volume set."
3,Not what you'd expect,"If you have heard ""Medusa"" or ""You are the Music"" and are looking for something similar, this isn't it. This version of Trapeze had 5 members and a real leaning towards a softer sound. That's not to say that the songs aren't decent, but they sound a lot more like Fat Mattress or one of the other flower-pop groups of the day.I have been listening to this album for 35 years and some of the songs did make it on to my ""best of Trapeze"" CD mix - but it is nowhere as exciting an album as Medusa is."
3,NOT THE '76 TRAPEZE,"THIS IS THE TRAPEZE ALBUM WITH GLENN HUGHES, NOT THE LATER RELEASE OF THE SAME NAME.THIS EARLY RECORDING IS BEFORE THEY TRIMMED DOWN TO A TRIO.OVER ALL IT IS A BIT BLAND COMPARED TO MEDUSA & YOU ARE THE MUSIC... THE FUNK HAD NOT WORKED IT'S WAY IN YET.I HAVE THESE FIRST THREE ON VINYL AND THIS IS THE ONLY ONE OF THEM THAT I WOULDN'T RE-BUY ON CD.GOOD FOR COLLECTORS BUT YOU PROBABLY WON'T LISTEN REPEATEDLY."
1,key & Peele,"Whack cheap imitation of Dave Chappell. You guy's want more words but I don't, I figured whack should have done it but let me do as you've askedGarbage corny goofy. Is that enough for me to submit my review"
5,"Serious laughs, serious smarts",Comedy that you don't have to be an idiot to enjoy! Love this duo who keeps it light and funny even while exploring dark and/or historically taboo topics.
2,"Worked pretty well at first, but...","The only complaint I would have had about this machine a year ago is that the steam wand is confusing to assemble and prone to make hot milk explode in your face, but now I am wishing I had spent the money on something else. The no-drip function has conveniently evolved into a non-stop-drip function. It's not worth the mess. Just save your money for a better machine."
4,"first gaggia lasted 12 years, this one is just as good, love it!!","bought this as a replacement for previous gaggia, works just as well as the last and in the color i wanted, the last one lasted twelve years and at a latte a day thats almost fourteen thousand dollars saved, sorry starbucks!! hope this one lasts as long."
5,Exquisite voice and style.,"I learned of Tom Andersen from a blurb about him and his voice in Playbill over a year ago. It claimed he had one of the most beautiful voices around today. That is the full truth. Additionally, his delivery, every nuance of every word, comes from the soul. Where did this guy learn so much feeling in his relatively young life? Even his breathing is musical. His choices are so right, and he never, never sings just to hear his own voice. His voice, the music, and the poetry are all one. Andersen is ecstasy!"
3,"A beautiful voice, but the album gets monotonous","I haven't heard a man's voice this pretty since Art Garfunkel was young. However, the album tends to be soft and low-keyed. After the third song, they all start sounding alike. Tom Andersen needs to get excited occasionally! I don't regret buying this CD, but I will only listen to excerpts from it the future."
5,Christina Ortiz plays so beautifully,"I got this CD because it was Christina Ortiz at the keyboard. The fact that delicious French piano music is served is purely secondary. I am not a pianophile so I don't know of better versions or other musician that play the same repetoire, but who might be judge better. All I know is that I think of the CD now which I have played over and over again in the car as a gem. It has soothed me when in a somber mood and it glistens with joy when I am in happy mood. Roughly one half of this relatively short CD is Debussy. From his Arabesque No.1 and No.2 to Gllwog's cakewake the music is just played expertly and effortlessly. After the Debussy are kind of like one hit wonders like Satie's Gymnopedie No.1 which is probably the best example. It is all French music and is all very illuminating. This is a DDD CD put out in the early times of digital back in 1987. It's too bad MCA didn't do more classical music.Highly recommended. Five Stars."
4,SOLITUDE SPRINGS CREATIVITY,"This book was an honest account of May Sarton's struggle with depression and her strong need for solitude. She expressed her great fustration with going away from her writing space and yet still struggled with her own loneliness. She is a complex, direct and somewhat unhappy but she tries to seek out people whom are not threatening to her by invading her space or trying to hard to understand her need for solitude. This is a valuable work to read if you consider yourself a creator with a strong need for silence to think thoughts and create."
3,Into the heart of a poet,"Journal of a Solitude is an account of a year in the life of May Sarton in the early 1970's. It is an interesting journey into the mind and soul of a writer and poet.Sarton was a difficult person, and subjects to bouts of intense anger and dark depression. She still managed to be amazingly prolific, however.Sarton describes country living in New Hampshire, her attitude toward her career, and her interactions with the people around her.It is ostensibly a very personal journal, but it is obvious that Sarton seemed to view anything she wrote as eventually publishable. If you are interested in writing or reading about the life of a creative person, you may be interested in this book."
2,Self-absorbed dreck,I read a lot of autobiography and personal growth books. This book was almost impossible to get through because the writer seemed so self-absorbed. I found myself getting irritated with her mistreatment of people who legitimately cared about her. I kept waiting to see some kindness. The whole thing felt narcissistic. There's a major difference between wisdom and lazy self-indulgence.
5,Pentangle Can Do No Wrong!,"The English folk/rock/jazz/blues band Pentangle from the 1960's had five members (hence the name Pentangle), including the virtuosi guitarists, the late Burt Jansch and John Renbourne. The pure and haunting voice of Jacqui McShee gave me an ideal to aspire to in my own singing. Jansch's voice is one of my favorite male voices, too. Especially listen for these tracks on the album: ""A Woman Like You"" and ""Sweet Child."""
4,WARNING is a crock.,My copy sounds great. And so do the MP3's I ripped from it. It looks like Macrovision still has some homework to do. (Actually I think Mr. Dunn is an idiot).
5,Wonderful!,"My husband and I listen to this cd all the time, and we never tire of it. You should purchase this cd. It is really good."
4,What a fun movie and soundtrack,"I watched this movie on a whim and found it to be a lot of fun. I have just recently started listening to bluegrass and I found that I quite enjoy it. The soundtrack to this movie is what makes it so much fun to watch. I would definitely recommend this movie and soundtrack for anyone who would like a simple, upbeat good time."
5,Fabulous!,"After seeing the movie, I just had to hear the music again. I was not familiar with bluegrass before and I haven't seen much else that I would buy, but this album is terrific."
5,everybody has this cd,everyone has this cd because its the best collection of bluegrass music around it will keep your feet tapping the whole time it is a great cd
5,a brilliant reminder of what country music used to be,For this son of the South these tunes bring back a child hood steeped in bluegrass and real country music. This recording will reach across generational lines and delight anyone who listens to it. Do yourself a great favor and put this cd in your collection.
4,Traditional Sounds,"After seeing the movie I bought this soundtrack for myself, and each of my relatives, (no one was disappointed with their Christmas gift). For anyone who enjoys the sound of Bluegrass, Gospel, or more traditional Country music this CD is a real pleasure to listen to!"
5,Met my expectations,Wonderful. As a lover of both the Film and the first soundtrack CD The 2CD Deluxe Edition was a great addition to my collection. I am a bluegrass lover and find this CD certainly satisfies that love. I enjoyed the complete versions of the songs and the ones not in the film or on the original CD. I highly reccomend this CD.
5,oh brother where art thou?,"based on some of the reviews, i just wonder why music is compared to a movie rather than just enjoying the music for the music itself...obviously there are those reviewers who got caught up in the emotionalism of the movie and expected the music to create that same dynamic...it is simply music, no story line....speaking of which that is what i really like about this album is just the simplicity of many of the songs...nothing complicated or loud, just good clean mountain music...if you are looking for fancy schmancy music, this isnt the album for you."
5,Love this soundtrack,This soundtrack as a different mix of music. Old-timey and fun. It makes you want to sing from your soul.
4,A fine sound,"The songs, the harmonies, the lyrics, are really entertaining and generate a nice sound. I'm not a big bluegrass guy but I really enjoyed the movie so decided to buy the album. I have been enjoying it ever since."
4,"Great Album, but product problem","The album's great and works fine, but I was bummed to see a crack in the case. A minor issue, however this was a gift for somebody and that annoyed me."
5,knowing the music,"This is the roots of bluegrass, gospel and country music. The arrrangement of ""I am a man of constant sorrow"" is unlike any I have ever heard. Dan Tyminski is from my county and I""ve had the pleasure of meeting him before. He's a great guy and an awesome musical talent!"
5,"O Brother, Where Art Thou?",Did not view the DVD but received it in a short period of time which was great because I was sending it as a gift.
5,O Brother Sound Track,"I ordered this for a friend. He said it came in record time, and the disc was in perfect condition. I was very pleased since it was a surprise gift. Thanks for great service. vcj"
5,Awesome!,"I received this cd super fast, and it was exactly as described condition that seller had stated. Points for honesty from me. It plays beaufully,& like brand new. No scratches, or skips. I couldn't beat the price! I had looked at buying this brand new,and choked when I seen the price from others. I can't beat this store for their fast shipping, honest reviews of their products, quality of their products,& their shipping. It was safe,& very secure. Thanks so much. I'll definitely be telling my co~workers,friends,& family about you~"
5,The Real Thing,"Red alert from the Centers for Disease Control: This CD is a powerful and effective vaccine against the dreary, dopey brainlessness of contemporary country. ""O Brother"" is as good an introduction as you will find to the roots of American traditional music. There's enormous sweetness and soul here, not to mention musicianship beyond compare. Most of the material on ""O Brother"" is newly recorded, by a roster of first-rate artists including Alison Krauss, Norman Blake, and the always-astonishing John Hartford, whose loving contributions to the preservation and extension of old-timey bluegrass music are beyond compare. Inoculate your ears with ""O Brother."" You'll be glad you did."
4,More fun then dating your sister!,"As one loney voice inhabiting the endless pop culture consumer wasteland, I too came upon this soundtrack via the Cohen Brother's hit movie and the seductive product placements at borders books. Deprived of free will or a personal opinion, I'll have to agree with opinions of my musical betters and exclaim that this CD provides a thin slice of Americana bluegrass. I particularly like ""I Am Weary"" (track12) and ""Down to the River to Pray"" (track4) and am eagerly waiting for the JA-Rule remix featuring Britney Spears, P-ditty, or Kid Rock.As Ulysses Everett McGill once said, ""Pete, the personal rancor reflected in that remark I don't intend to dignify with comment. However, I would like to address your general attitude of negativity. Consider the lilies o' the goddamn field or... hell! Take Delmar here as your paradigm of hope."" Anyone seen my Prozac PEZ dispenser?"
4,"O Brother, Where are Thou",The Cd is very nostagic and has a very capitvating beat. It blends tradional as well as new millieuim accents into a quasic factorial presentation. It definitely needs to be added to anyone CD collection.
2,"OBrother, Where Art Thou? Seems to be a good Question!","Would not buy this CD again. My fault, it states the CD is a sound track and this is true. My mistake, and I will not make this mistake again!"
1,O BROTHER!,"I adore Blue Grass. This is NOT a Blue Grass offering. With the exception of maybe three songs this was, to my ear, one weird selection after another. I would advise the shopper to sample ALL selections. (Chain gang laments????) I give this a capital L for lemon."
3,Not as good as expected,I love Bluegrass music and find it to be very relaxing. I didn't find this CD to be quite what I expected after all the hype. I was somewhat disappointed. Maybe if I had see the movie I would be more interested in the soundtrack. It's okay but I wouldn't have bought it if I had listened to it prior to buying.
5,Music to appreciate!,"I truly reccommend this cd for those of you out there that wish to broaden their musical horizon. For those of you who might buy it just because someone told you it was good is not a good enough reason. The music contained on this album is superb without question, but I believe that there are a few people out there that might find bluegrass or traditional American folk boring or uninspired. This is not the truth. If this is your first shot at this type of music, this is a good start, as is the soundtrack to Songcatcher. Bluegrass is a very down to earth form of American storytelling that has seen a rise over the past few years. If you like stories about the heart and America' struggles and strife-buy it. THe album is well produced and fun to listen to. If you are up to listening to something new and are tired of the Britney's and the matchboxes, this will surely catch your attention."
3,"O Brother, Where Art Thou?",This CD was a big disappointment to me. The fidelity is real uneven and a lot of the music is boring. I guess I was expecting more tracks like the ones by Alison Krause? I should have saved my money!
3,O'Brother LP,"OK I guess, since I haven't listened to it yet as it was a gift, but you asked. 2 more words"
5,I enjoyed the movie and the soundtrack,"I bought this CD for one of my favorite songs ""I Am A Man Of Constant Sorrow"". When I hear this song I can't help but smile thinking of the rendition that the Soggy Bottom Boys gave during the movie. There are several other good tracks on this CD. I'm very satisfied."
4,Having seen the movie...,"I really wanted to get the CD. I still love all the songs. They just don't have quite the same impact as when heard in the theater where I assume they had surround sound. I have a Bose. And, of course, the movie has the very loud volume. No regrets."
3,Not really Delux,I thought that the additional tracks were disappointing and not worth extra money. I still really like the original tracks from the movie.
4,"Great music, no problems with CD","(...)I had no trouble with this one on my PC: I was able to play the CD and encode the tracks as MP3s (for personal use, of course).It goes without saying that the music was great."
5,Addictive Array of Winning Picks...,"From the previews for the film alone, I became sickly fixated on tracks from this album. I bought the soundtrack two weeks before the movie opened in LA. Like some kind of crazed junkie, I listened to the disc repeatedly and manically for about a month before retiring it to the shelves of other favorites. The soundtrack embodies a wide array of very American music. Folk, Blues, Bluegrass, Spiritual, Gospel - the soulful sounds of lower-middle and lower class America. The tunes, though, are addictive. Without being syrupy or simple, the melodies and rhythms anchored themselves to me. Everyone I know who has experienced this album has had a similar reaction. Buy this album, you'll be singing it in the shower for months to come."
5,Great to have,We both love this type of music and have several CDs of this type. The bands playing here are great. We watch this movie often.
5,big rock candy,this movie was great. i love to watch it over and over.this was my dads favored movie and horry potter
4,Public Domain songs available though MP3s,"On Amazon's MP3 downloads I found many, MANY versios of the movie songs I wanted - ""Constant Sorrow"", and ""Jailhouse Now"". A version of ""Jailhouse"" by the Memphis Jug Band from the 1930's is a real hoot with very different words from the movie version - do yourself a favor and check it out. The movie version is also well covered."
5,question,I absolutely love this album but was wondering if anyone knew the song played in the final scene of the movie not listed on the soundtrack? thanks for any help.
3,"Well, it's not great.","I have to say I was dissapointed with this CD. Although a few songs are worth my time, the rest just weren't my style.If you're a fan of bluegrass, I HIGHLY recommend you get the Cold Mountain soundtrack and/or something by Alison Krauss instead of this."
3,Somewhat Disappointing,"I'm a long-time listener of bluegrass, old-country and gospel music since early childhood. I found this soundtrack to be somewhat disappointing and certainly not as ""outstanding"" as some of the previous reviewers and critics have said. How it was voted ""Album of the Year"", I'll never know. Maybe because I haven't seen the movie. It does contain a few of the great, old-timers singing some of their best music, however the rest of the songs are by bands I've never heard of and they don't quite do justice to the songs as the original artists. Most of the music tends to be geared towards prison, death, dying, and heaven. Because of this, it may certainly fit well with the movie. I'm not sure why ""I am a Man of Constant Sorry"" is recorded at 2 separte intervals on the CD, but then, this song is well worth listening to twice. If you're into the movie, you may be into this CD. However, if you haven't seen the movie, I certainly wouldn't rush out to buy this soundtrack."
1,mediocre,"I was really disappointed in this album, because I really liked the music in the movie. The best track was McClintock's original 1928 version of 'Big Rock Candy Mountain', but I would have been much happier buying a Dr. Demento collection with that on it. The 'Nobody But the Baby' track sung by the sirens seemed better mixed in the movie, which made it more evocative, and that may have been the problem with 'Man of Constant Sorrow' too."
5,Just downhome fun music,We loved the movie Oh Brother Whereart thou! We enjoyed the cd whilewe were traveling through a hilly area of southern Missouri. Wejust really got into it.
5,Just a perfect album,"I went to see this movie, namely because Clooney was in it, and everyone in Kentucky knows where he came from. The movie was terrible, but the soundtrack really got my attention.I listened to it, skipping only the alternate versions of ""I Am A Man Of Constant Sorrow"" and ""In The Highways"". The album is great, for anyone who doesn't mind a little homegrown music, and for anyone who needs a break from today's pop-culture ...The album includes, of course, Man of Constant Sorrow, but some other greats too, like Big Rock Candy Mountain (perfect in every sense of the word), You Are My Sunshine (again, perfect), In The Jailhouse Now, and nearly everything else (except for the instrumental versions of 'Constant Sorrow').All in all, this album is what classic bluegrass is all about. Buy it, enjoy it, thank you."
4,There's more where this came from,"I can't believe this disc is so high in the Amazon.com rankings. Just goes to show you, if you put something good in front of people they'll still eat it right up. Ralph Stanley must be laughing. I don't think he's had a crossover hit like this in his 50+ year career.But hey folks. This stuff has been around a while. Check out any of Dr. Ralph's or the Stanley Brothers' back catalog - dozens of listings here on Amazon.The song ""O Death"" is an oldie all right. It comes from an English broadside of the 16th century! There's a towering version by Bessie Jones of the Georgia Sea Islands on volume 12 of ""Southern Journey,"" the reissue of Alan Lomax's historic recordings put out by Rounder Records. Get the whole series - you won't be sorry.But the best way to experience old-time music is live. Like in the parking lot of the annual Old Fiddlers Convention in Galax, Virginia. Yeah, people are still making music like this, and you can too!"
2,And to think that this was album of the year,I absolutely could not stand this cd. I hated it. It sounded like something from a distant time and the music had no emotion. The movie was O.K and the music went with the movie but hearing this on a cd is just worse than a migrane headache. I have absolutely no idea how this beat the other albums for album of the year. The only good stuff on the whole cd is stuff from Allison Krauss who sings pretty nice. Another strange thing about this cd is how something this awkward and outdated can make it so big. Listen before you buy don't go buy it just because it was album of the year to me it tanked. Absolutely not todays sound at all. Everyone in this country has a right to their own opinion and how dare anyone (...) tell somebody they are not a good music lover. Because I know good music!
1,poor quality,"The CD I ordered ""Oh Brother, Where Art Thou"" was so scratched I had to throuw it away. I love the music but it was impossible to listen to."
1,SD CD,There was no explanation what a SD CD was. Be careful if ordering from this seller. No one can listen to the CD without a specific SD CD player which isn't even sold anywhere. Seller also asked me to pull my bad feedback and offered me a gift certificate if I gave good feedback. Very tacky!
1,Sound is awful...,This stinks. The sound is awful. Not what I thought it would be. It had a different picture on the cover than the one I sent for. Will NOT buy CD's from Amazon again.
2,One good song!,I have no idea why people like this CD. In my opinion there is only one good song. - The hit song. The others are only good if you like jail house music or old time southern depressing music. Worst CD I have bought in a long time.
5,pure pleasure,I loved the movie and listen to the soundtrack constantly. It's great to sing along with...or try to!!
3,Disappointed,The music is okay but not the recording from the movie. The music in the movie itself is much better.
5,I don't like country...,This sound track is the best to hit the market in a long time! Your feet will be moving and you will be singing along. Great songs!
3,Why not get the real thing?,"Yes, there's some great music here on this overly hyped, overly publicized album. But the lead-in song (?), the 4 minute chain gang chant, Po Lazarus, is a waste and five versions (including the instrumentals) of Man of Constant Sorrow is way too much. This is one of my favorite genres of music, call it roots, Americana, bluegrass, country, string band, whatever - but I would recommend getting the real deal although you might want to use this album as a sampler. As for some of the artists that appear here, there are outstanding albums by Norman Blake, Gillian Welch, Alison Krauss, John Hartford, etc. Other seminal artists well worth seeking out are The Delmore Brothers, Bill Monroe, The Stanley Brothers and The Carter Family. Or how 'bout some of Woody Guthrie's early recordings with Cisco Houston?"
5,a tremendous album and a big surprise,"i'm not your typical fan of bluegrass or country music. not even close. i was first introduced to this music on an overseas plane flight where this was one of the movies playing. i ended up watching the film 3 times (not because it was that great, but because of the music!) i ended up buying the cd on the drive home from the airport.and what a purchase. there are songs on the cd that could best be described as heavenly - notably anything with allison krauss singing. two particular standouts are ""down to the river to pray"" and ""didn't leave nobody but the baby."" i worry that i'll wear out my cd by constantly playing those tracks...another standout - with two versions on the soundtrack - is ""man of constant sorrow""i can' even begin to explain how surprised i was that i enjoyed this cd so much. this type of music isn' something i would even consider exploring and to find myself enjoying it so much was a shock."
5,I LIKE IT! I LIKE IT!,"The movie was great! And the next day after seeing the movie I ran right out and bought the soundtrack CD. I listen to the music every day and am not tired of it yet. I love every song except the first one on the CD.It would be O.K. if the sound of the picks were not so loud! The other songs are great, and the music stays with me all day! I cannot tell you which is my favorite because I love ALL of them. I can just see the actors in the movies sing as I listen . How about that yodeling! If you like old-fashioned music, you must have this one. It has some great thought-provoking spiritual songs also."
5,"O Brother Where Art Thou, CD","Wonderful, wonderful....full of songs . Highly recommendSongs are wonderful, good listening, arrived in quick fashion, love it....topsGreat for your collection"
5,"Oh, Brother",Bought this for my bipolar and autistic 12-year old great nephew and he loves it and all music. It helps calm him down.
5,"Charming, warm good ol fashioned music","I bought this soundtrack, because a lot of the music on it was what my grandmother would play on her antique phonograph. It brought back lots of memorys. I can't wait to see the movie, and the Cohen brothers are excellent creative individuals. This music is easy to listen to, I throw it in while Im surfing and just kick back and relax. Hope you enjoy it!! Im betting a couple of Oscars for this movie!"
5,Flok songs that are digitally perfect,"Years ago my father would drag me to a few folk music festivals. I never really liked them, but what I didn't know was that my father was causing this music to become a part of become part of my DNA makeup. I didn't realize this until on a whim I bought and listened to ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"". This soundtrack brings back memories for me. If you're history is similar it will do the same thing for you.Of course, there is more to this album than just a reminder of the folk music I was forced to listen to. The new songs are catchy and the old songs are wonderfully done. With their simple messages they dig into our human collective conscience. They remind us of who we are and who we should be."
3,"Big sky, arid land.","Keep in mind now that I have not read the book, I am only noting what I heard that hooked me enough to put it on my wish list.I was reading ""Walter Benjamin at the Dairy Queen"", impressions of Texas by Larry McMurtry. Larry McMurtry was talking about the western sky. He said that while driving from Virginia back home to Texas he would notice, after crossing the Mississippi, a lifting of his spirits due to the widening view of the sky. He felt closed in by the limited view of the sky in the wooded areas of the east. He quoted another author who expressed the same feeling, and he then specifically recommended this book for addressing this feeling.At the same time that Larry McMurtry was talking about the sky he was talking about the arid land of west Texas, and how difficult it was to establish life there. He recommended this book, written in the 1940,s, as a good study on the accomodations living creatures must make to aridity.That's enough for me."
1,Rechargeable questionable!!!!,"When iron is taken off of the charging base,the battery back up feature does not work."
4,Music to lounge and move to.,"I found this cd to be a great find, two cds with some really good tunes and all of them have a different beat, style (latin, rock, etc.) and speed. Some of the remixes of by BAZ for ""Never Ending Story"" even the Bob Marley Try Me. If you like dance this has it with double and Jungle Wonz.My favorite is Jerome Sydenham with Stockholm-Go Bang (Club Mix) which is a very good tune.Enjoy the music."
2,Great subject - poorly handled,"Giuliani is an interesting subject on any account, whether you personally like him or not. Kirtzman's account is very detailed and shows extensive research - but, and this is a big ""BUT"", he struggles in producing a book that you do not want to put down.He bombards the reader from the outset with names that may not be familiar to non-New York journalists or the ordinary reader, and he finds it difficult to set the scene for the next ""act"" in Giuliani's attempts to gain and/or maintain power over NY City.Kirtzman may be a good writer of 500 - 1,000 word articles, but a whole book has clearly been a fight that he did not win.Still, because of the subject matter, a book that should be read, even though it is hard work."
2,"Sorry, but this book is a Loser of the Week.","This book was a major disappointment. Am I supposed to be impressed with the story that a black deputy mayor was twice stopped by cops and harassed? That's way old news, Mr. Kirtzman. If you're going to buy one of the Giuliani bios, don't waste your $$ on this one. Frankly, I would have been far more interested in Dominic Carter's appraisal of Giuliani. Not to mention Budd Mishkin's."
5,Awesome!,"This was a fantastic Story from the TOR Legends, and is now been expertly adapted into this comic. The Art is beyond beautiful. Dunk and Egg look better than can be imagined. The Colours of G.R.R. Martin's world truly comes alive. So rare is the combination of perfect story and perfect art mixed as one. The Jet Li movie ""Hero"" is a close as i can think of something that captures the feeling of imagery and story as one - and even it falls short of this masterpiece. The whole time i was reading this i could not help but think was an amazing movie this would make. Be warned however, if you buy this comic you will find yourself buying all of G.R.R. Martin's other works as well -you will be hooked - it will be expensive - and you will love it!Relic113"
1,This is NOT a novel!!!!,This is a COMIC BOOK. For those RR Martin fans please understand that this is a graphic novel. . aka comic book.
1,I'm SO angry!,"GRRRRR, I'm SO angry! Thought I was buying a book, but instead discovered that I'd bought a comic book!!"
3,Don't be fooled by the looks,"I purchased this hand blender for my wife last Christmas, 2007. She has used it regularly with good results. However, today the gears in the main body broke and a new one can be purchased for around $25 plus shipping, so in the $35 range. The main body is on backorder, which is not a surprise since many others must be experiencing the same trouble.Her previous hand blender was purchased at Walmart for $25 and never had a problem. She gave it to our daughter this summer since she had an extra blender.We like the stainless look but wish the insides were a little more sturdy. My wife will be purchasing her next blender at Walmart for about half the money and it won't be a Cuisinart unit.Brad"
1,Do not buy this clock,"Length:: 0:37 MinsI recently purchased the 190100 ships clock. If you want to be able to hear the bells, you should not buy this clock. Otherwise, it is a quality clock, but the sound of the bells are cheap, tinny, and low volume. I cannot hear the clock ring when I am in quiet room if I am 6 feet or more from the clock. I will attach a video link (or you can check it out on youtube: [...] ) I took the video of this clock at 3 feet. You can year my wife doing dishes two rooms away (28 feet away) so that is the sensitivity of the camera microphone. Watch and decide for yourself.I emailed Weems and Plath and they said that the sound of the bell is all that I should expect.I am very disappointed in my purchase."
2,Can not hear bells.,"Weems & Plath Martinique Collection Quartz Ship's Bell Clock (Standard)Clock is of the high quality that one expects from Weems & Plath. However, one can not hear the bells striking unless one places his/her ear on the mechanism. Then, the sound is a clicking rather than the bells striking. In my opinion, the clock is not worth the extra two or three hundred dollars over the price of a quartz ship's clock without the bells."
5,great product,"I have been using this product for approximately 3 years. It definitely fends off any critters (large or small) from eating your plants. The solution is very strong, so I use it mainly on flowers and shrubs as opposed to vegetables and or fruits. I imagine it would be ok to use on edibles, depending on the permeability of their skin, however this is one marinade I would absolutely pass on. The residual effects of the application last for quite a long period, at least 6 weeks to 2 months."
1,Pesky Rabbits/Squirrels/gophers,"Sprayed several days in a row but it did not keep my irrigation feeder lines from being chewed through. I replaced the feeder lines four times and sprayed each time and the ""varmints"" would not stop. I finally raised the main and feeder lines about three feet in the air with stakes and bars and so far it seems like they got the message and went away, hopefully. At any rate, the spray did not do me any good. Sorry."
2,Deer Cocktail,The deer in our neighborhood like to eat the new growth on our rose bushes in the spring. I was hopeful this might slow them down and allow the growth to mature a bit. Instead they seemed to thick it added flavor! They ate our rose bushes down to the nub with this liberally applied as directed. Apparently our neighborhood deer didn't read the label!
2,Painful Read,"This business classic is difficult to read. I am more of a narrative reader, barbarians at the gate, anything written by Mr. Kawasaki, but this is a list of recollections and letters that is just dry as dust."
5,The Reason General Motors Was Once Dominant...,"""A car for every purse and purpose"". This was the reason that GM was once the world's most successful company. Alfred Sloan succintly details how he directed the company to take not only financial considerations, but also product planning into account. His hierachy of models, ie Chevrolet, Pontiac, Oldsmobile, Buick, and Cadillac, in that order, was stroke of genius, virutally guaranteeing that the entry level buyer who started out with an economical Chevy would continue to buy more expensive GM brands as his income increased. Only now is GM moving back to that mantra, albeit with unfortunate hesitation. Had GM kept each of brands as a distinct marque, there is no doubt the company would still command at least a 50% share of the North American market share."
3,Bad pump,I love the foaming soap but they really need to work on the pump. I have to pull it back up each time which is a pain.
3,No new material,"I just want to emphasize what Michael Dalton said in his review. All this is is two previously released DVDs: Tales from a Golden Age: Bob Dylan 1941-1966 and After the Crash: Bob Dylan 1966-1978 placed in a new cardboard box. Nothing new. Nothing added except the printing on the box.If you don't have these other DVDs, you can buy this set and save a few bucks. If you do have the others, save your money."
1,Sucked,"I thought the DVD sucked tremendously. It was very boring and if I could, I would return it for a refund. There was only one ""small"" clip of Dylan himself. I'm very disappointed."
4,good read,While reading this book I felt like I watching an episode of criminal minds. you get to know the killer while they figure out who he is.
3,Interesting mostly,"Another murder mystery to read and it kept me interested enough to finish it. I think almost every possible murder has been covered, so it is difficult to be original."
4,From Romance Novels to Thrillers Without Missing a Beat!,"For a first time mystery/thriller writer, Anne Frasier hit the mark! I especially enjoyed the realistic character development that occurs throughout the book and I enjoyed the way the book ended. I know there will likely be a sequel, but even if there isn't one, I appreciate the fact that Frasier did not feel compelled to wrap the ending into a tidy bow. She didn't need to go off into a romantic ending nor make everything end perfectly. Instead, she mimics true life.Her storyline was creative and unique. I will be recommending this to my friends and family. Keep up the great job Anne. I'll be on the lookout for your next novel. Welcome to the mystery writers' genre. I think you have much to offer."
3,Slow,There were a few chapters that kept my attention....... :(....................I guess we will try another and hope for the best.
4,Hush,"Very good plot, I liked the run around game that the killer played... it was a very enticing book, good read, good write... the only thing I didn't like was you have to read about 85% of the book before the action starts"
5,Review on Hush,Anne Frasier is so amazing!!! I am in love with all the books i have read of hers so far and i cant wait to read all the others!! She is by far my favorite author ever!! Thanks so much Anne for your amazing stories!!
5,Captivating Page Turner,AWESOME free book! From the first to the last page this book held me captive. A real page turned. HUSH!
3,Solid read,"This book by Anne Frasier is a very good read. The characters, even the screwey ones, are believable and the plot just keeps on thickening. Enjoyed the concept of the book and the way the characters were developed. A good read.J. Robert Ewbank author ""John Wesley, Natural Man, and the 'Isms'"""
2,"Poor prose, predictable plot, but it's a page turner","Hush is a typical serial killer thriller with rather predictable characters and poorly written prose. A tormented detective, a victim turned psychologist and a deranged madman lead the cast. The plot is predictable and unimaginative, but keeps the reader engaged as the suspense rises to the, not unexpected, happy ending. Hush is a fine book to bring on a beach holiday, but despite the author's occasional attempts at profundity this is essentially bubble gum literature."
4,good writing - quick ending,"Based on this novel i would say that Ms. Frasier is an above average writer. I appreciated her writing structure and style amd i enjoyed the way she developed her characters into real people. This was an above average read right up to the climax at which point the writing and stucture took on a compressed, forced feel. Yes the ending made sense, it just lacked the depth and flow of the rest of the novel.If your main focus is good writing and character development than this is a worthy read. If your focus is more about action, suspense and creativity than i would give it a pass. Personally i liked it and will read more of Ms. Frasier."
5,Excellent story,"I got this book through a free link, and what a nice surprise. Excellent pace, very well written, and the characters jump off the pages. I am now a Frasier fan. It's worth more than the current $3.99 price. There are a only few typos, and none take away from the pace of the book."
5,Great read!,"Overall a really good book. Kept my interest the whole time. Read it quickly. There were a few typos that shouldn't happen any more than they do in a printed version of the book that were distracting,but the story itself I really liked!"
3,Good read,"The story keeps your attention, but I felt like the ending was rushed and incomplete. I definitely needed more at the end."
5,"A Great, Chilling Read","I found this book to haunt me during the day, wondering what was going to happen next. It did not disappoint. I will definitely look for more books from this author and recommend it to my Kindle friends!"
5,Outstanding,Like reading an episode of Criminal Minds. A lot like Karen Slaughter. A wonderful read and free. I would have bought the book.
5,Great suspense/thriller,"This was the first book by Anne Frasier that I read. I was not disappointed. Seldom do I find a book that I can't put down. This is one of them. I stayed up until 2am to finish reading this book. If you like suspense/thrillers, you'll enjoy this book. It had my nerves tingling all the way through. I find most authors try to drag the suspense too far and I end up skipping a couple of chapters because I'm ready for the end. There is no drag in this book and the length is just right. Anne Frasier doesn't extend the story just to make the book longer. This is the first book I've read in a long time that has impressed me this much. A great read and probably reread."
4,dynamite debut,"Serial killer novels are a dime a dozen now, and ones where the killer squares off with his long-time nemesis in law enforcement is getting to be a cliche, but this novel's strong grounding in realistic psychology make this one stand head and shoulders above most. The fact that the killer's motives and actions have a solid basis in psychological fact make them all the more chilling, especially in the scene where he gives profiler Ivy Dunlap a present. There are a few missteps and cliches, especially at the beginning, preventing me from giving this 5 stars, but I still give this a strong recommendation."
5,Great fast paced thriller,This was a good thriller that kept my attention. Couldn't put it down until for 2 days. I would never have picked it up other than it had Jayne Ann Krentz's name on the cover. It certainly was intense. I liked the strength of the characters and was glad there wasn't romance to muddy the story. I look forward to reading more of Anne Frasier's books.
4,HUSH,This is not the HUSH I read. Read the one by Eishes Chayall. It was well written. It teaches us about a religious community. Many aspect of the insulated world are really good. That being said it shows how powerful people can harm many. This had to be extremely difficult for the author to write. It many ways it had to set her free. Hopefully her words opened the eyes of the community and yhey should now know the SHAME is in there silence.
5,Excellent!,"This book grabs you from the beginning and doesn't let you go! I lost lots of sleep because I couldn't put it down! Don't think about it, just GET it!"
4,Enjoyed it in spite of myself,"First off, I have to confess that serial killer murder mysteries aren't my thing. It's been done to death by the likes of Patricia Cornwall and Kathy Reichs. I used to read them, now I seldom do unless my mother passes on one she's read. That said, I downloaded this book for free when I first got my Kindle and had no idea how quickly I'd soon amass a collection of over 100 books and I enjoyed it. The characters are likeable (except the killer), the plot progressed at a nice pace. That babies were being murdered was deeply disturbing to me and there was a hinted at but unexplored plot line with a twice adopted child that may or may not have been the heroine's baby that she believes is dead, but overall it was a fun read."
3,Enjoyed reading it but it wasn't that great afterall.,"I thought it was good while I was reading it. It was interesting and the characters were just ok but not great. The book wasn't that great. There was really no twist, not that much suspense, it was kinda just blah with a blah ending. It was just a standard average police drama about the cops and a psychological profiler hunting down a serial killer. I expected more suspense and a better ending. I love surprises and twists and this had really none. No outstanding or memorable characters, and not a memorable book."
3,Disappointing ending.,"Anne Frasier writes a compelling and engaging book, the suspense is palpable and keeps you adhered to the book. The plot tantalizes with relentlessly mounting tension and buildup, only to fall completely flat with an abysmally unsatisfying ending."
3,Good - but a little predictable,Characters were good. Couple of unexpected turns in the story kept it interesting. Some parts were very preditable and that sort of spoiled it for me. It was fun though.
1,Big build up no delivery,"As a reader of many of these types of books, this was extremely disappointing to the point that I regretted spending the money for it. I won't buy another written by her."
4,Is anyone else's misprinted?,"The book is great, of course, but does anyone else find a jump at page 208 back to page 145? Then when you get to 208 from the jump, it skips immediately to page 273. I can't get my money back now because I've already written in the book, and I'm extremely disappointed that the copy does this."
3,"Cute, very cute","There can be little argument that Joyce is a master of the English language. Portrait gives us 200 pages of beautifully written prose. At its best moments, I just sat back and let the words flow over me. But to be honest, I didn't find much substance to the work. It was an interesting theme, the struggle an artist must undergo to break free from the world in order to create--and even though it was told in a unique, original fashion--i was not particularly moved by any of the thoughts, or ever particularly engrossed in Stephen's life. I will say though that for someone interested in dipping into Joyce, this is a MUCH wiser first selection than Ulysses, which just might force your reading comprehension faculties to commit suicide..."
5,Master edition of a master work,"I recently re-read this edition of POTA and was pleased to find the experience even more exhilirating than when I read the book first in college 25 years ago. The notes and essays are invaluable to an American Jewish reader of a book so imbued with issues critical in Irish Catholic life and history. The issues raised are, above all, universal. Read it, and read it again!"
5,An Excellent Introduction to Stream of Consciousness,"As a high school senior, I have just started grappling with more difficult literature. Reading Portrait and Faulkner's As I Lay Dying provided a sound basis for more difficult works, like Morrison's Beloved. All of these works, with their use of the stream of consciousness so popular in modernist literature, powerfully express their authors ideas.Also, this is probably one of the best works about teenage rebellion, ever."
2,"Mostly a ponderous, ill-tempered harangue","The first two chapters of this book are very good, but Joyce fumbles the ball irretrievably in the third chapter and the dreary effort results in a painful loss. The third chapter is a boring, over-wrought sermon; the fourth chapter brings more pontification, miserable soul searching, and hackneyed attacks on religion; and, the fifth chapter is garrulous and didactic---an excruciatingly dull and inartistic parade of platitudinous ideas, littered with a pretentious display of Latin. The characters are tiresome, the dialog is tedious, the reading is labored, and the rewards are few and minor."
2,Not up to par,"I was thoroughly dissapointed with this book. The only reason I read it was because it was required for my AP English class. From its sorted beginning, I knew I was in for one confusing time. Yes, I must admit that it did get better, but not nearly as much as some would like to think. The plot was unclear, and his ""journey"" through life is easily dubbed a bore. Stephen Dedalus is on a quest of sorts -- he is growing up, discovering who he is. With that comes adventures. But Joyce never elaborates on the ones that are the most dynamic, and continues on to drone about everything in the same monotone style. Mind you, it's all stream of consciousnes, which makes it even harder to digest. I DO NOT reccomend this book to ANYONE. The only reason I give it two stars instead of one is because I want to give him credit for fooling everyone into thinking this book has any literary merit."
1,Hm... it's worse them the worst book that I have ever read,"Maybe I am a peaky reader, but the main thing that I expect from a book is to have some sense. A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man by James Joyce is a big disappointment for me, because it's very very BORING.I know that I should not say that I dislike a book before I have finished it. But this novel is pretty disorganized; I couldn't resist reading more than some pages. I felt that I had wasted my time with this book, where almost nothing happens. I also had the impression that Stephen is an outsider - who remembers the entire conversation at the Christmas meal (for example) - not the main character. Probably I cannot understand the stream of consciousness technique, because I couldn't read Mrs. Dalloway either.There are too many characters that do not seem to be clearly defined and that discussion about religion - on the First Day of Christmas - was too long for my taste.If all Joyce's novels are as this one, then he lost me."
1,Summer reading :(,I hated ALMOST EVERY page of this book. It was confusing and very hard to relate to . SOOOO GLAD ITS over !!!
5,"If you don't like this book, you don't like reading.",Joyce's prose is the closest thing to a hybrid of narration and poetry that I've experienced. I read this when I was in my twenties and have never fully recovered. Bliss.
4,"thought provoking, but slow","if action is not your boat then you will probably enjoy this book. it chronicles the events of a young man's, stephen dedalus, youth and adolescent years. joyce depicts the struggle between Irish nationalism and religion beautifully, all while keeping pace with stephen's journey from the strict jesuit Clongowes to the less sheltered Belvedere to trinity university. don't expect to feel the same about Ireland's struggles after finishing this book."
1,No footnotes,This version of the book does not include any of the footnotes found in other versions. I believe they are important in interpreting the text.
1,"I came, I saw, I hated!","Sure, all the critis can say that james joyce is an amazing author. But i couldn't stand this book! Mabye i didn't understand it cause i'm not cathloic or something. But i don't think that is it. I would heartly reccomend against reading this book."
3,"Not bad, but it aint no Dubliners","At first it's elusive as hell, but once Stephen starts to develop mentally, it goes through some very well rendered (if fairly standard) buldinsroman tropes. Especially the little creative epiphanies he has along the way, which feel vital and at times, even beautiful almost a century later. There is a lot of mucking about with nascent catholic guilt, and the various kinds of guilt that arise from blindly accepting, fighting and eventually rejecting said catholic guilt. I felt like there might also have been a whole layer of classical allusions which I'm just not educated enough to get, what with the little quips in latin and all. I like Stephen Daedalus, but I didn't find myself genuinely caring about his ambitions and insecurities the way I did with the characters in Dubliners."
3,"Beautful prose, but long intervals between interesting ideas","The writing is most definitely the work of a gifted scribe. The use of language and descriptives is amazing. Unfortunately, large passages of the book are devoted to somewhat demonizing Catholic sermons that make a point, but a long winded one. The two most interesting discussions - What is art? and Do you believe in god/religion? - occur only near the very end of the book."
3,thought provoking,"Portrait...defines a new turn in the century of fiction writing. From the cold, heartless times of Ireland, here is a tale of growing up that offers a critical insight into the heart of an eight year old.Joyce's style is inimical,imperfect yet charming. he paints the human world of emotional bonding in the most natural way on a child hearted canvas.A great contrast from Ulysees, Portrait...is definitely a read that would make you sit up and wonder about the simplest of life's truths"
2,Couldn't stand the main character.,"I was forced to read this for AP English, along with Dubliners. Joyce wrote this book with himself in mind - the main character's life is almost autobiographical. Therefore I don't want to insult Joyce himself, but the main character's attitudes were absolutely repulsive to me. Cynicism and outright pretentiousness can only take a man so far.That being said, the writing is incredible, as can be expected. My issue with the book is the simply bitter aftertaste this person's attitude left in my mouth. Read it if you don't mind a main character who would refuse to take communion for his own dying mother just because he hates religion. This is not heroic indifference to the society of the time. This is being a jerk."
5,James Joyce A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man,This wonderful work of Joyce really comes alive with the performance which includes singing and piano.
2,Thumbs down,"We are introduced to the character Stephen as a young boy as he grows to manhood. Stephen is sometimes strange, smart, brave and shy. Emphasis on the strange most of the time.This is a book I almost wish I had read it for a class so there would be a discussion and I would understand it better.I am not sure how Joyce considers this young man an artist because he is inches away from becoming a priest. Unless this is suppose to be Joyce's story. The first chapter is gibberish to me and I almost didn't go past it. But I did and it got better. Although as soon as it got better and I understood what Stephen was talking about he would on OCD rant about pretty much on anything like hell, authors, philosophy ...I know a lot of people dislike this book and sadly I am one of them."
3,Kind of boring,Yeah I liked this book. But it was slow and boring at times. It makes for a good read if you're just looking to pass time
2,Bad sound quality,"Although the box/cd quality of the item was superb, the audio quality of the recording itself is far from perfect. The audio gain is very low so that even when you listen to the various segments, the sound is very low and disturbing. I wish I could return the product back to the manufacturer."
2,glad I read it; wouldn't do so again,"I can't honestly say I enjoyed this work. While it was impeccably written and deeply philosophical, the style chosen to write it in was distracting and caused far too many pauses in reading. It did give me some inspirational insights to methods in which I can add elements of philosophy to my own writing, but overall led me to understand methods of writing that serve to distract and confuse readers. His overall purpose (of showing the evils of Irish Catholicism, and the necessity of embracing a Nietzschian way of life) seem lost on the reader that doesn't care to struggle through the overemphasized rhetoric. I'm glad I read it, but wouldn't do so again."
1,In the Immortal Words of Mark Twain...,"""Classic--a book which people praise and don't read.""This quotation fits in quite perfectly with this book. Except I'd like to replace the ""don't"" with ""shouldn't"". Thanks again Mr. Twain. enough said..."
1,Collectors Library's absurd size.,"I haven't read ""A portrait of the artist as a young man"" yet. I'll have to get an edition from another publisher first. I received a Collector's Library edition and just sat slack-jawed for a couple of minutes. It's all of 6 1/4"" by 3 7/8"" with print I can barely read (20/20 vision). It looks utterly ridiculous in my bookcase with all the other ""normal"" books. I guess I should have paid closer attention to the product description."
1,Not worth all the Hype,"I have heard that this book is one of the best English works of the 20th century, ranking high in many lists and such. I highly disagree. I TRIED to read this book, but the book is simply very uninteresting. I lost the point Joyce was trying to make not only because I lost interest, but also because the point is buried under multiple layers of philosophy and symbolism. My conclusion, if you are looking for a book that delves into human development in a highly realistic manner, get THE CATCHER IN THE RYE instead. Not only is CATHCER more enjoyable, you will get the point even if you are only an average reader."
2,Great disappointment,"I had high hopes for this book since I feel like a young artists surrounded by bland conformity, but I was wrong.This book was torture to read.Only Nanthaniel Hawthorne is more boring.I don't particularly care to read 5 or more long pages about how much God loves him.Great!Thats beautiful!God loves you!Do you have to elaborate until you get repititious.Joyce does this more times in this book.He speaks of something for pages long, but fails to offer anything new after the first page.Just writing with fantastic vocabulary and repitition.Very little in this book has any real wisdom.Sure Joyce has miracolous desciptions of quasi-psychotic visions and I believe that is all he's got.Two-thirds of this book are a waste of ink and the other third that has substance isn't impressive.I'm glad I finished it so I can move on."
3,Portrait of the Artist as a Boring Man,"Wow! Do people actually read this disjointed stuff for pleasure? That being said, I do give this book a middle-of-the-road 3 star recommendation because it does have its uses. I keep a copy by my bedside at all times. If I'm ever suffering from insomnia, I simply pick up this book and start reading because it's guaranteed to have me sawing logs in less than five minutes."
2,"another very very dull ""classic""","After having greatly enjoyed the Dubliners - a series of perceptive and beautifully written short stories about ordinary people - I looked forward to delving far deeper in Joyce. When at last I cracked the cover of this book, I was sorely disappointed at the unbearable pretention and lack of plot in this novel.Stephen Daedalus is a callow snob, whose concerns are so otherworldly and obscure that they feed directly into the most ridiculously romantic and shallow stereotypes about artists as unusual gods. It is simply a monument to a young's man's egotism and unerring sense of his own destiny. There is little to learn from all the strange things he obsesses about, his experiences rarely ring true, and there is nothing notable about the writing.This novel is probably coveted in undergraduate lit classes because most of the readers are untested adolescents, who feel they can conquer the world so easily. Alas, as an adult it is just boring."
5,Portrait,The book was purchased for an online college class. It was a difficult book but I gained insight into the emotional development of this artist from childhood into adulthood. The 99 cent book was in perfect condition.
3,Interesting and compelling,I really enjoyed this -- the writing is lucid and accessible. His ability to evoke emotion and put one 'in his shoes' shows his talent and ability to translate it to his readers. Too bad he later careened into the world of the absurd....
2,Beautiful but ponderous.,"I will re-read this novel at some point more slowly.The prose was beautiful but if that is all I look for in literature, I would read the poetry of Burns or Shelley.A novel should tell an interesting story and this does not. The undercurrent themes of the conflict between the Church and the stuggles of the Irish people are interesting as are the conflict that a young man fels as he begins to question the tenets of the Church and family."
5,Development of the artistic temperament.,"A portrait of the artist.. is predominantly an auto-biographical tale of Joyce's own artistic development and sensibilities. The very poor reviews this book has received recently, are quite awful, and unsubstantiated. To say Joyce is unreadable, untenable, and desultory, is to miss the entire 20th century and modernistic importance of Joyce. The previous reviewer criticised Ulysses' change of narrative: isn't that one of the great things about the book, the revolutionary technique, and multiple viewpoint?"
4,The 2008 reissue isn't changed from 2000,"The last time I taught the Portrait I used Oxford's excellent 2000 edition. In 2008 this was reissued with a new Standard Book Number, but so far I've found no changes in the text. The bibliography hasn't been updated, for instance, and the typo on p. 134 of the 2000 printing (where the sentence ""Once a priest always a priest"" comes out ""Once a priest ways a priest"") is still there in 2008.But there is a change in the cover design. In 2000 this included part of Gino Severini's ""Self-Portrait,"" but in 2008 the picture has been cut further back and it's now misidentified as ""A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man.""This edition is still excellent, but if you have a chance to buy the 2000 printing there's no point in spending more on the 2008 printing."
1,"A Portrait of the Artist . . . book no. 3, 97 to go","I am on the verge of trashing the list of the top 100 novels that includes this novel of James Joyce's as No. 3. I can say that it was somewhat more readable than ""Ulysses"", but on a scale of boring to orgasmic, it is near to redefining the word boring.With the few Latin phrases mixed in with otherwise anticlimactic text, I would recommend this book be placed next to the wood-burning stove to be used for starter on a cold day. I did obtain the oversize edition in large print, so I could also use it for a nice breadboard."
2,Introduction to Joyce,"I read somewhere that readers should start with a book like this as opposed to simply jumping right in to Ulysses. Well, that may be true. This book was not difficult to read. But, it really wasn't that interesting. I found myself less willing to put forth the energy to get through Ulysses after reading this."
2,VERY poorly edited version by Soho Publishing,"Buy another version--Soho's is shameful. Not only is it a non-critical edition with no annotations whatsoever (which is fine--that's what I ordered, after all), but the sloppy editing throughout the entire book is so bad it's actually distracting. A high school editing staff could have done a better job."
2,Mildly annoying,"Stephen Dedalus grows up in Ireland in the late 1800s and attends school. He wavers between living a priestly life with all its values and restrictions, and turning his back on the priesthood. As a teenager he is troubled by the subject of sex, particularly as it relates to the concept of sin. He takes religion very seriously.I don't see why this book would ever be considered great. It is mildly annoying."
2,"Motifs a plenty, but not much else.","Plowed through this book for English Class. We (*I write this with others from my class) liked the opening, where the Moocow appears. Sadly, it appears the Moocow was a oneshot character, and once it exits the novel on page two, things go downhill and never recover until they hit about ten miles below the equator. Full of symbolism; but that doens't mean much. We gave it two stars; one for the Moocow, and one for the amusingly long title our poor English teacher was forced to write on the board each day."
1,it wouldn't even burn,"In my case Portrait managed to take frustration and disappointment to previously unimaginable heights and it undisputedly stands as the most unsatisfying piece of literature I've ever attempted to digest. Initially Portrait simply bored me beyond belief, but then it also seriously enraged me on account of its meandering pointlessness. In order to protect my sanity I found myself compelled to take drastic measures and set aside my objections to the ritual burning of books. However, I could only get the bonfire I erected to eat away a disappointingly small part of my copy of the book. Thus Portrait even refused me the pleasure of seeing it go up in flames... (I will probably get a lot of stick for this, but having survived Portrait I should be able to deal with the worst kind of written abuse anyone can come up with.)"
5,A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man [Audio tape],My companion for driving; this makes traffic a joy and delays a treat.
1,"NO INTRODUCTION, ETC. IN THE FREE KINDLE ""EDITION""","There were no extras in the Kindle edition, at all. I'm not cheap, and I'm willing to pay for a classic book in it's entirety. Unfortunately, the Kindle edition is not as described by reviewers of the book form, so I deleted it. It is a classic book that, as everyone knows, is highly complex and requires touchstones in order to maintain the thread of the story. This is not that version!"
5,VERY hard to put down!,"I think ""A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man"" was one of the best books I've read. You start reading it and get addicted. If you haven't heard of James Joyce and are interested in his work, then I strongly reccomend this, but you must have an open mind. I read this when I was 13 and James Joyce now has become one of my favorite authors."
5,Nice,I bought the glasses for my husband. They seemed a little same but we still love them. We always buy rayban glasses because if the quality. The glasses are dark tented and block our alot of sun.
1,Serious disappointment. Badly written.,"Page after page I waited for the promised brilliant plot to unravel, for the fast packed action to unfold. I hoped it would get better but my hopes soon dissolved in frustration and anger about having wasted the money for this garbage. The plot consists of a rather dumb conspiracy tale featuring the usual big, mysterious and omnipotent secret agencies which till the last page remain just that -with no further enlightening whatsoever. The protagonists are very roughly hewn and thrown into the already bad enough story as if picked out of an assemble-your-own-book-so-that-you-can-call-yourself-author instruction sheet (take 1 or 2 villains, 1 really really good guy, 1 supersecret private agency which comes to the rescue after the amount of pages is about right...). Sometimes you wonder if the many weapons details come straight out of a copy of gun magazine. Brrr, what a disappointment. My advice (earned the hard way): do not touch this book."
1,What a piece of Trash,"Ayn Rand was not lonely, she was full of joy. This is a ridiculous assault to anyone with the ability to read and reason. Any person can learn about Rand's life through documents, her works of fiction and non-fiction, countless interviews and personal accounts of friends and aquaintences. Anyone that would read up on her life and her philosophy would discount this book as lies. You do not even need to subscribe to her philosophy or agree with her ideas to see this book is written by someone that has no understanding of Rand's ideas and Philosophy."
4,'Antisocial witch' is right . .,"Ayn Rand was indeed a highly antisocial woman and the followers who ape her thereby risk making themselves equally unfit for life in human society. However, Barbara Branden is to be commended for writing such an excellent biography of this strange and narcissistic figure."
1,Totally Discredited,This biography has been comprehensively refuted by recent articles as being both dishonest and highly inaccurate.
4,Great bio of one of 20th century's original thinkers.,"By focusing on Rand's triumphs and failures in her personal life, Branden presents a story as dramatic as Rand's fiction. I've often noticed a disparity between her explicit philosophy and her style of dealing with people. Even in some of her non-fiction she has a bitter, impatient, and excessively critical tone while presenting some of the most positive pro-life philosophy ever written. This biography helps to explain the many aspects of this complex woman. My only regret is that Branden does not explain Rand's philosophical achievement."
1,Never saw Rand's husband drunk,Barbara Branden admits to never seeing Frank Occoner drunk.!!!The source of the rumor that Ayn's husband was an alcoholic and who spent thousands of hours with Ayn had never seen the alleged alcoholic drunk.
1,Feeding on the host,"The author questioned Rand's mental faculty stealthily through the negative.For example Miss Rand took diet pills but did not suffer from mental disorders.Branden drew a correlation between mental disorder and diet pills, which she did notprove. Then she denied the existence of the mental disorder that she wanted thereader to retain. The author has a monstrous approach!"
1,"Not a reliable biography, as recent new books show.","Branden's book remains the only full-length biography of Rand, although new primary material arranged in chronological order has been published as ""The Journals of Ayn Rand."" Referring to the journals, Rand's own notebooks which she never herself published, the arbitrary nature of Branden's work is clear. As an example, Branden draws dubious psychological conclusions from a photo of Rand as a child in Russia, a photo in which Branden is not even sure who is Rand!Branden's book is more novel than biography, a novel in which the writer's conclusions are clearly motivated by something other than a desire for the truth. Readers should not be duped into thinking that Branden was close to Rand; for the last 14 years of Rand's life she had no contact with Branden, and Branden had no access to important primary materials. Avoid this book, and read the Journals instead."
3,An antisocial witch,"After reading this interesting biography of Ayn Rand, I am confirmed in my opinion that she simply didn't measure up to the standards of human decency. Why Branden continues to have any respect for her is beyond me."
5,Fair and Balanced Bio of Ayn Rand,"Unlike the fawning bios by Ayn Rand ""disciples"", this bio gives you a fair and balanced story of the life of Ayn Rand. Instead of presenting her as some super-guru and putting her on a high pedestal, this shows her in all her humanity, and shows that Rand, like the rest of us, was just as fallible, just as irrational. She was cruel as well as kind, rational as well as wildly irrational. Good as well as bad.Branden did a fabulous job at writing Rand's story.Highly recommended - especially for those Rand fans who refuse to see that Ayn Rand was first and foremost a human being."
5,great book!,This book is extraordinarily written and full of great drama. They really should consider a hollywood film on this book. Loved it!
2,school,"I'm currently using this book for school, and although the material is a bit useful it is not the easiest to actually understand. I am getting reinforcement through my teacher, but without him I wouldn't have much interest in the books flow. I guess not the strongest book to use for teaching a second language."
5,Perfect Condition,The book came quickly and is in perfect condition. It is such a helpful book and the service was great!
2,Diluted and of limited use,"This book is a preachy, watered down, unacknowledged rip-off of the Sedona Method by Hale Dwoskin. Although it predates Hale's book, the Sedona Method course goes back several decades with both Hale and Lester Levenson (whom Jim knew), the technique's originator. The author pontificates at length about all the ways we get hung up in life while offering very little in the way of SPECIFIC instruction for doing anything about it.I give it two stars because the information is not irrelevent, just severely limited. There are a few insights that may be of interest to seasoned releasers. Other authors, like Patricia Carrington, have managed to put their own spin on Sedona Method-like techniques and to make a valuable contribution in the process. Britt just avoids the issue almost entirely.I would very much recommend The Sedona Method by Hale Dwoskin over this space holder. Can you tell? Check out the SM book, or better yet the audio course - it actually delivers."
4,Works Great,I am satisfied with the way the meat tenderizer works. It is not hard at all. Just once across the meat is adequate to tenderize the cut. I got it to make cubed steak for when I prepare country fried steak.
5,Jaccard: You will love it!,I bought this product for my best friend as a gift. I have had one for years and just love it.
4,entertaining and educational,"This book contains a bunch of chapters that are each about a different aspect of German culture and history. The chapters are nice and short, so even someone who hasn't had a lot of German could sit down and understand them. There are questions at the end of each reading, which basically check to see if you understood the general idea of the reading. Anyone who wants to learn a little more about German culture and recent history (and has a fairly good understanding of the language) would enjoy this book."
4,novelita buena,"Inicio muy bien, continua a veces bien a veces aburrido. Mezcla tiempos muy bien. Final expectacular. No se diga de un vocabulario muy mexicano, grosero, pero con esa suavidad haceb que te de risa como una palabra soez puede hacer tanto daño pero no en la boca de Laura."
5,very bright light,"I noticed right away how much brighter these bulbs were than my old bulbs, I would buy these bulbs again."
5,Replacement bulbs for Doctor Mom Original Pocket Otoscope,Bought the Doctor Mom Original Pocket Otoscope and almost immediately the bulb burnt out. These fit perfectly and its good as new.
3,Good intro book,"Espenson's book is ok. It's a little difficult to read at times, but covers the basics fairly well. More references would be useful. A good introductory book."
1,ask yourself a simple question.,if this guy was for real ask yourself why does he charge thousands of dollars for a phone call? why doesn't he find missing children? why doesn't he use his so called gift to help mankind? if he found missing children or solved spectacular crimes it would be worldwide news? he would be the most famous person in the world.don't be fooled as i was. ask questions before swallowing all this.
5,Joel Martin: Researcher par excellence!,"This amazing book well-deserved the status of New York Times Best-seller. Joel Martin, former skeptic of spirit communication, documents his gradual conversion through communications received from medium George Anderson. If there is a question to be asked, Joel finds it. There is an excellent account of various tests that were devised for Anderson. In Joel's transcripts of radio broadcasts made by the medium, my only criticism was that sometimes Anderson appeared to be asking too many questions of the callers and thus modified his messages from the response. In spite of these flaws, Anderson proved himself able to give accurate names, places and spontaneous comments totally relevant to the inquirer's needs. Joel Martin's WE DON'T DIE is a classic in the history of parapsychology and psychic research. A great read!"
5,One of few books which profoundly affected my life,"I read ""We Don't Die"" I believe in 1989. It set me on a spiritual journey beyond my ingrained childhood beliefs. I have purchased this book for more friends than I can count. I found it liberating and hopeful, and helped me to completely lose my fear of death. I will always recommend this book and appreciate it."
5,Excellent book,George Anderson is wonderful! I would really like to know if there are any new books coming out from him.
2,Joel Martin ruined the book for me.,"I had no problem believing in George, but I had a hard time with Joel Martin - he came across as being pushy, which made it difficult to read. After a while, I found myself calling this guy names out loud - immature, I know, but I couldn't help it!"
5,COMFORTING,"I have read two of George Anderson's books now. The first being OUR CHILDREN FOREVER. I have just finished WE DON'T DIE. The premise is the same in both books. After reading them it only confirms my strong belief that there is an afterlife. I am not religious and have little belief in God but I know our engergy lives on. George Anderson is a gifted Medium. He has used his spiritual powers well. I enjoyed both books but WE DON'T DIE was a bit dull in parts where the authors go on & on with tales of people trying to debunk Mr. Andersons gift. I found myself skimming thru parts. However, It's a fact filled book worth anyones time to learn of life after death."
5,We Don't Die,"I read this book within the first few weeks after my 19 year-old son was killed in an auto accident and it saved my life. George's words and experiences gave me hope when I had none, and gave me a new insight into the next world. I have since read all of George Anderson's books and even went to New York for a personal reading with him. George's gift of mediumship is extraordinary and his message is simple -- WE DON'T DIE! Our loved ones who have passed are very much alive and involved in our daily lives. I now highly recommend this book to everyone I know who has lost a loved one."
4,Review of We Don't Die,A wonderful inspiring book for people who have lost their loved ones. It provides a detailed look at George Anderson's experiences and also discusses the arrogrance of so called critics or establishment people who claim to be researching Mr. Anderson.Doctors and scientists seem to be more concerned about how others would look at them if they agreed that Mr. Anderson was legitimate. I remember reading about Edgar Cayce and his documented works. The people who were studying him also were ridiculous in their research for a man who was willing to be tested.
5,I loved it dearly,"I have been a big fan of George Andersons for years. This is the best of all three of his books. I loved every page of it. I have a very sick father and I have read several books about the afterlife and I feel that these books have provided me with a much more positive outlook on life and what happens to us after we have passed on. I am thankful for mediums like George Anderson and James Van Praagh because I believe that they possess a wonderful gift. I recommend this book to anyone that has lost a dear friend or relative because I feel that it has tremendous healing power. After I read this book I saw life through different eyes and I think I am changed forever. Thank you George, for being you."
5,How Can You Not Believe?,"If you are a doubting Thomas, read this book. After facing a difficult cancer diagnosis, I found this book a tremendous comfort. It confirmed my notions that death is not a final end. I am a discerning reader and a book reviewer for a large paper, and I am convinced that George is a gifted medium and the REAL DEAL. I liked this particular book because it was written by a journalist who watches George Anderson evolve. This book is guaranteed to help you make that transition, the one we all must make one day, without fear. (Question: why are the big three psychics in U.S.A--James Van Praagh, John Edward and George Anderson all from the New York area?)"
4,a gift of comfort,This book was recommended to me after I lost a loved one and I found it very comforting and have since given it as a gift to friends when they loose some one they love.
4,"Yes, there is life after death","George Anderson is a medium who has helped many people reach their departed loved ones.Coming from a Catholic background having gone through the Catholic school system, George was given the prophetic gift at an early age. Since the Catholic Church didn't re-confirm his gifts, George moved on in his spiritual life with encouragement from others and in particular Joel Martin.He was introduced to the public through radio programs that Mr. Martin produced and also television. Although George was not particularly excited about the television spot he understood that this was a way to reach many who had questions about the afterlife.This book does give the reader food for thought.Other authors worth reading on this subject would be Dr. Raymond MoodyReunions: Visionary Encounters With Departed Loved Ones, Dr. Elizabeth Kubler RossQuest - The Life Of Elizabeth Kubler-Rossand Betty EadieThe Awakening Heart: My Continuining Journey To Love. See my book reviews on these authors."
5,A Must-Read if you have even a passing interest,"I had always vaguely believed in life after death (although with doubt and hesitation), when my girlfriend gave this book to me. It was absolutely incredible, I read almost 300 pages in 1 day. This book is VERY believable, and the author (a radio talk-show host) is very earnest in describing his experiences with George. The experiences recounted in this book are amazing and profound, and I certainly now want to learn much more...It has definitely changed my perspective on things-"
2,OUT OF SYNC among other problems....,"I just picked this DVD up today at my local record store (yes envy me for having one) Fingerprints. The good news its a pretty stellar show ( I saw this tour myself in LA), the bad news is that this is obviously a very official looking bootleg...which is why its probably NOT billed as a Jeff Beck item. The video quality is sub par by today's standards and even broadcast in '99 standards and my experience with Japan is that their productions even in '99 are technically the worlds best. Now the worst news is its terribly OUT OF synch...for a bunch of the show...for some reason in the middle of the 5th track the DVD stops...goes black and when it resumes its IN synch...about 21 minutes into the DVD.So....if you have the good taste to be a fan of the great Jeff Beck...enjoy, but be warned to lower your video and audio expectations. Am I still glad to have this bootleg...absolutely....so 5 stars for Jeff and zero for the producers of this DVD bring me to 2 and a half."
2,Good show marred by flawed production,"I agree with the other reviewer - this is horribly out of sync, so bad that I had not actually made it to the spot he mentions where it goes black and then resumes in sync. I did notice skipping around that it seemed more in sync later in the show but this sort of product is inexcusable these days - especially when I purchased what I can only deem a bootleg copy a few years back that not only looks cleaner as far as video but is completely in sync from first to last. Since it was being officially released I felt I'd purchase it legitimately to get the artwork, working menus, etc. I too saw this same tour and the performances are excellent - too bad about the flawed production. I'll be tossing this disc and putting my bootleg copy in the case instead as it's far better"
2,where is it?,based on other reviews I will not buy this. love the concert so will wait fora superior version(hopefully). don't know why it would be so difficult as it wasrecorded for japanese tv.
2,Beck 1999 DVD Japan - brown cover with pagoda - YouTube is better,"Neither video or audio is very good. The DVD I received has a brown cover with a pagoda above the title and a crowd at the bottom There are better versions. The good version begins with the full title sequence. Other versions and this DVD, cut part of the sequence."
2,Sync Problem Is Correct.,"As another reviewer said, there is a serious sync issue with the disc. It only lasts through the first five songs or so, and resolves by 'A Day in the Life', but it pretty much ruins the disc. A pity, since the sound and video quality are okay - not spectacular - and the performance is pretty good. This is the only record of Back playing with the Jennifer Batten group, and I wish it were better."
4,This album goes a schmittle bit all over the place,"Good follow up to Nilsson Schmilsson! I liked ""Remember"" and ""Spaceman"". The atmosphere of this album is relaxed yet erratic and raw. ""Take 54"" ""At my front door"",and ""Youre Breakin my heart"" come to mind for the rocking raw numbers.""Joy"" ""Id Rather be dead"" and ""The most Beautiful world in the world"" shows an adventurous attempt at song style i.e country, choir, and reggae/island. Harry Nilsson had a distinct sound but he never ""played it safe"" on any of his records. Play YOUR listening experience safe and buy this album/tape/cd/download/whatever!"
5,a classic moment in rock,"I was a young teen when this came out and it was big in my neighborhood. This guy was a real talent. Go ahead and buy it, its well worth it."
5,Bejewled,Full of Nilsson gems that burst when properly aligned. Prepare to be dazzled by mediocre displays of rupturing prisms. STOP.
4,Defiantly Trey Day,"I found the album to be pretty good, I am a huge trey songz fan because he can change his sound and style which is exactly what he did on this album. The songs are good minus a few you could skip over(like any other album)but overall he did a good job."
4,Half Baked,"Half of the album is really good and the other half is like hmmmmmm. I love songs like ""we should be, can't help but to wait, I don't love you, lone gone missing and last time."" I think if Trey do more songs like those his career will really blow up. He has a great voice but he is just not getting the right songs to show his vocal skils."
2,The Oversexed Underdeveloped Teenager.,"It's been awhile since I've done a review, (at least since I moved from Virginia Beach, VA to Portsmouth, VA), so here goes. I know Trey isn't a teen anymore, but the latest cd of his makes him a cast member of the American Pie movies-all sex and no substance. This suprises me because his first cd was on point and made me want to purchase this one-or maybe it's just the age difference between us that make me look for more. Each and every song was about some form of sex-rough sex, submissive sex, kinky sex, so forth and so on. I don't have a problem with it unless that's all that you have to offer. To be such a talented young man, this offering was pointless and empty. I won't totally give up on him, but I will listen to several tracks in whatever store has those automatic earphones first before I spend anymore money on him again."
5,Definetly a Must Own,"Im telling you...this album is a must own if your a Trey Songz fan. Im a big fan of Trey so you might just think that im hypin this album, but it really is great. I like basically every track on the album. Trey is definetly one of the most under rated R&B; artists out there now and if you listen to this album plus all of his mixtapes, you too will agree with me. This dude can sing and rap on the same song...but he'll make it come together just fine. Yes i must admit he does more rappin on this album than on ""I Gotta Make It"" but he switched his style up a little and im diggin it. Tyrese tryed to do it as well, but he didn't really blow with it. You'll most definetly love this album!!! GO COP IT!!!TREY DAY IS MAYDAY!!!"
5,Love It,"This album is the greatest of all time, in my opinion. The lyrics, beats, and of course the voice Trey Songz. I listen to it day in and day out. The best songs on there are Sex for your Stereo, which makes you feel as though Trey is talking directly to you; We Should Be, which is smooth, melodic, and can make your insides do flips; and Long Gone Missin, which is good to listen to when you're upset with your significant other. Trey's album has a range of songs from cheating to being totally in love. Its great for any mood you could possibly be in. Not to mention his incredible voice. The sprinkles of rap also show his extreme versitility. All in all I LOVE IT!!! And you will to as long as you are open minded and like good music!!!"
2,Trey...What happened?,"I brought this cd thinking it was gonna be as good as his first one...not the case to much tryin to rap, and it seems as if he fell into the trap that most r&b singers fall into...trying to have rapper or rap yourself on your cd...trust this cd was no where as good as his first..very dissapointed had high hopes for it"
4,Great CD,"I really liked the CD, I was pleasantly surprised with the sound and subject matter. I don't know why everybody is hating on the album"
2,Just Your Average,"The second cd from Trey Songz is a mixed bag. There are definately some highlights here, notable are tracks like the single ""Can't Help But Wait"" along with ""Missing You"" and The Jimmy Jam/Terry Lewis produced track ""We Should Be."" Unfortunately, most of this cd leans heavily towards fast food music and not the classic sounds that you hear from his debut cd ""Just Gotta Make It."" For an artist who can really sing, this outing doesn't really showcase his talents as a whole."
4,Excellent in a real way,"This is an excellent album. R. Kelly lends lyrical comedy with ""Grub On"" and Trey keeps the commentary real with ""Store Run"".My rule for a good album is it has to be a good buy. $1 per song :-) This album was an EXCELLENT value for my money. During a time when people put out garbage albums for $15 with 3 decent tracks, this album is refreshing. Worth the buy!"
2,Disappointment,"Wasn't impressed AT ALL! I actually expected more, so was let down. There's only like 3 songs i like in the whole album..sucks!"
1,Disappointed Fan,"Ok when Trey put out his first cd I bought it purely b/c I loved his voice and was so happy that the risk paid off. His first release was good and I became a fan. I'm not sure what the heck happened, but this cd is horrible. I'm only being so critical b/c I seriously was anticipating the release and went and bought it. I felt a lil cheated, but I digress...the cd's production is cool but the lyrics are a disappointment and even Trey's voice doesn't make up for that. All in all I'd say I like 4 Songs1. Role Play2. We Should Be3. Wonder Woman4. Can't Help But WaitAnd I must say the song with R.Kelly is wrong on so many levels. Just a bad song. All in all Trey's beautiful voice couldn't compensate for some of the hot mess on this cd. I hope there is a third album to give him a chance at redemption, but now fans like myself will likely be extra cautious about making that purchase. Never would've expected newcomer J Holiday to put out a better overall cd."
1,sucks,i never got what i ordered its been a month. it was only my second time using amazon and now i hate it!
2,Um What is this? Two stars for the two songs that I like.,"I'm sorry,""I absolutely dislike this album. The only songs I do like are ""Wonder Woman"" and ""Can't Help But Wait"". I don't know what it is the production or lyrics but my goodness.I want to smack Trey for making ""Grub On"" (I think thats the song). Basically, he is talking about being hungry and wanting some of this girl and how she is like his IHOP (eatery). That song is absolutely horrible. The lyrics.I really liked Trey's first effort. I will listen to this again to be fair but its killing me..."
3,I liked his first cd better,"I love Trey Songz. He has a great voice and he is fine as hell, but this cd was not that great. There are a lot of R&B songs out now, that I think if the song was given to Trey, he could sing it better. With this cd, he doesn't really have any hits. I predict that Can't Help But Wait will be his last, or second to last single from this cd that gets played on the radio or gets a video made. The cd is still pretty good, but I think he is still finding his way."
2,dont waste your money,"this has to be one of the worst cd's i have ever purchased. some of the songs he put on this cd are absolutely horrible, and it is not music. For example one of his songs called ""grub on"" is ridiculous. Its talking about getting food from ihop at around 4am. The other song ""store run"" is even more ridiculous. its talking about running to a drugstore to buy condoms to have sex with a girl before she changes her mind. these two songs are not music, its garbage! and in my opinion, he cant rap if his life depended on it. The best two songs that are on the cd he released on the radio."
2,DISAPPOINTMENT,TO IMMATURE WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE IF HE STUCK TO GOOD R&B SONGS INSTEAD OF STUPID LYRICS LIKE R.KELLY STARTED TO GET. ITS TO BAD I WAS REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS CD. I SHOULD HAVE WENT BY WITH OTHER REVIEWS ARE SAYING. GRUB ON SONG STUPID!. IM DISAPPOINTED I WANT MY MONEY BACK.
2,Don't like.,This album is his worst to me. It probably was good for the time it came out. I prefer slow Trey Songz songs. This album was kind of faster. probably meant for the club.
4,Trey's Day,"Compared to his albums after this one this isn't his best but if you're a true Trey Songz fan you should definitely have this in your collection. My favorites off of this album are Wonder Woman, Can't Help But Wait, Last Time, and the final track We Should Be. The album as a whole is good but those are the tracks that stand out for me. I also like No Clothes On as well."
4,Pretty Good,I actually enjoy most of the songs on this cd. The following songs are my favorites:Last TimeCan't Help But WaitGrub OnStore RunMissin YouRole PlayWe Should Be
4,Songz In A Minor,"Songz In A Minor""Trey Day"" has a stronger set of songs than ""I Gotta Make It"". It could be because of the top-notch producers enlisted for this album. R.Kelly, Danja(Britney Spears, ""Gimme More""), Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis, Dre & Vidal (Floetry), and Bryan Michael Cox are just some of the producers on this album. Trey almost seems like an artist who is comfortable being somewhat underground and not as revered as someone like Usher. Trey's current single, ""Can't Help But Wait"" (produced by Stargate) is rising up the R&B;/Pop charts so there is hope for this young fresh talent.I really like Trey's new album, and I was pleasantly surprised at it. I had dismissed it but I gave it a chance, and I am glad I did. My favorite songs on the album are:-Grub On-The Last Time-Long Gone Missing-Role Play-No Clothes On-Missing You"
3,Solid Project,"The Trey Songz album is a solid project. Skip the the first four songs and start with number five and let it ride. Wonder Woman is cool but the album really starts to take shape at number five. Top 5 joints are Last Time, Sex Fo You Stereo, Grub On, Role Play, and Store Run. Take off the rap joints and replace those with like above mentioned songs and you've got yourself a winner. Production of both music and vocals are solid. I like this album way more than J. Holiday."
2,just ok,"Trey Songz can sing but on this album he sounds like he is following a script as to leading the story. I dig Store Run the best and that to me is where he should be headed overall as a Solo Artist. I like Grub on which R.Kelly wrote for Trey and Trey is a Huge Kellz fan. it's catchy. but alot of the tracks here don't showcase enough of Trey's voice and for my money Trey isn't getting top of the line Songwriting and Production. thus far early on in his career he hasn't the right songwriters and Producers to take his talent to where it should be. aside from a few decent tracks nothing on here is memorable,but this cat can sing and if given the right material he might have a decent run."
3,hmmm!!!,"sadly, thats all I could say about this album. It really pains me to give this album three stars(really 2 stars but i gave him one for effort)he is an amazing artist but the poor production and out there lyrics are what made this album barely listenable. I thought his voice would get me over the horrible choice of beats but i found myself skipping alot of tracks. basically the singles and my favorite ""we should be"" are the only tracks that i feel are lyrically and productions wise good tracks. for all the pushed back release dates i expected this album to be a classic but i was deeply dissapointed. although he is not the worse rapper (20x better than solja boy) his rapping on a coulple tracks in the begining of the album made it feel segregated in style and form. Songs i would recommend: ""wonder woman,"" ""can't help but wait,"" ""sex fo yo stereo,"" ""we could be."" if you want to hear some better Trey songs look to his mix tapes, honestly they have better songs than this one."
3,UnHappy 'Trey Day',"I am so disappointed in Trey. I LOVE LOVE Trey Songz but he just didn't deliever on this cd. I like naughty Trey from previous songs like 'Ur Behind' & 'In da Middle', they were catchy. On the current album, I like 'Wonder Woman', 'No Clothes On' & 'Fly Together'. I am not sure why the album was originally pushed back from it's first May release date but if this is the best there was...I would have waited longer in order to get a GREAT cd. It does sound like the stupid R Kelly songs that are released now comparing women to planets, cars & food. I hope Trey is already working on his third album because this one can not hold me as long as 'Gotta Make It' did. I guess I will go back and listen to the first album some more."
1,Oh dear!,"Ms. Adverse, in case you read this, understand that I love you dearly. Your earlier works were fantastic!With that I have to say, however, that with ""Spin"", things go off the rails pretty much completely! I honestly could not find one song with a hook or catchy refrain anywhere on this release!This album is - I suppose - jazz pop at it's worst (with bands like Carmel, Weekend and Working Week being jazz pop at it's best). I was warned against this by a friend years ago but I didn't want to believe.I don't mean to be so negative to one of the ""founding godmothers of indiepop"", but it must be said: It is far too overproduced and frankly, it broke my heart!... and not in a good way...Stick with ""The Incredible Anthony Adverse"". It compiles all of the essetial Anthony Adverse in one convenient (if in BAD need of remastering) place!Such a shame, really."
5,Worked Perfect.,"I bought this with the Apple Leather Conditioner. My 2Unfold grey leather bag from Hard Graft was really getting covered with scratches and dirt, so i wanted to revive it back to its former glory.I followed the instructions - Use with a soft cloth, wipe in circular motion. Repeat with Leather Conditioner after. I did it with half the bag so that i can compare the before/after effect.End result was fantastic - The Cleaner lessened the visibility of the scratches and brought the leather back to its original, darker color. The Conditioner gave it a shine, and a nice, smooth protective feel.It's been a couple of weeks by now, it feels like the bag is more resistant to scratches.Overall, i am just so glad and relieved it works with my leather bag!"
3,Good but not great,"I purchased this edition for a class. While the quality of the binding, layout of the actual play, typeface, etc. are solid and what I expected for the price and the type of book I was purchasing (paperback); the introduction is disappointing. Extensively written and extremely boring, it made me want to give up on the book altogether before I even began reading the play (and I'm a Shakespeare fan!). The author brings up multiple interpretations by others as validation for his views, but also takes pains to point out why all the other interpretations aren't as good as his own. This introduction is detailed and not intended for anyone but Shakespeare scholars. For someone who has studied Shakespeare's life and era in the past, this edition will provide lots of information connecting and comparing this play to what you already know and can be very educational."
3,"Not Great, But a Valiant Effort.","I once read that Shakespeare wrote this play not so much for profit, but to reflect the conflict of different theatres. This would certainly explain why the play lacks his usual orginization and focus. Perhaps he was inspired by Christopher Marlowe's ""Dido Queen of Carthage"" to combine the timeless Greek Mythology and his mastery of the language. But despite the lesser impact, orginization, and focus of Marlowe's attempt at this, the play is worth reading. Shakespeare offers a valid theme. (Personal interest is often the root of civil chaos.) There is some well placed comedy. Classic characters of Greece such as Agamemnon have some striking passages. When total war breaks out, the images are quite memorable. After the Trojans are defeated, Troilus' final speech of revenge is a satisfying conclusion. If you like this play, you may wish to read Marlowe's ""Dido Queen of Carthage"" afterwards. The events in Marlowe's play would follow the events in this play."
5,authentic and understandable - a rare gem in the sand,"spirituality is hard to expose in the physical word, but it is there and Rabbi Steinzaltz has been able to translate his experience and complex knowledge into a language that is within reach. OK some of the material would be out of reach for the beginner but there is something here for everyone."
4,Fight injustice and get rich!,"The injustices are real and well-detailed. Particularly, the long Chapter on the Michael Jackson sitaution of the '90s - the whole depressing subject is handled with clarity and care. Also, those involving Club and Restaurant owners, TV Producers who....just don't get it....and get humiliated above the level of the those who felt *they* were humiliated.Yeah, sue the pants off these bad boys.Allred has a great story to tell, an inspirational and informational treatise for all, though her pro-militant feminist bias bleeds through every line. She had a rotten marriage and sought to turn the tables on any dude who even vaguely resembled him.Allred may have an ""agenda"" and may get too personally involved in cases(reference Ambrey Frey) but her overall contribution to American law is noteworthy.Very readable, even funny in parts. Nice collection of photos."
1,"Should be titled ""fight back and make me richer""",Just a venue for further self-aggrandizement. Gloria Allred has made her self rich by taking on such villians as childrens haircutting salons who charged different rates for boys and girls and fast food restaurants who's employees refuse to hand out discount coupons. In the process she is millionaire sucking money out of her victims forcing them to settle rather than endure long drawn out court proceedings and bad publicity.And in the end her clients get a pittance in settlements and she is a millionaire. I would be curious to see where her clients are today. Way to go Gloria. Your legacy is undeniable. You are everything that gives lawyers a bad name.
1,When does this marketer ever work?,This woman stands many inches taller on tv than she is in real life. She is a jesse jackson female counterpart and wannabe and wants to insert herself into every dispute. She forces herself into every controversy and conducts herself like ruth westheimer. She makes no sense and is always poised to give a liberal and feminist slant to every controversy and when there is no dispute she is ready to produce one. An agitator and media hound. What a joke! She should write a cookbook and perhaps she could mix up something other than the listeners and readers' brains.
5,Re: Well-written memoir,"I read Gloria Allred's book FIGHT BACK AND WIN with great interest. I have always admired Gloria because she stands up for those who are traditionally not empowered in society, including women and children, and she's been very involved in fighting for victims' rights. I thought the book was very well written and the part on Gloria's childhood and upbringing in working-class Philadelphia was very interesting. Anyone who is interested in becoming an attorney because they want to make a difference in somone's life will enjoy reading this book."
3,"TNT, the pride of Norway","I've been listening to TNT for a while, and I think they're good. They're not excellent, but it's absoulutely worth listening to, and ""Tell No Tales"", is a good start. Now, what I will recomend you it to try get the very first TNT album (that CAN be a hard quest), it's with the original members (Dag Ingebrigtsen vocal, Morten ""Diesel"" Dahl drums), and the band sing their songs with Norwegian lyrics.The album is great. The songs are very good, and you will allways remember Ronny LeTekr's excellent guitarplaying. So if your not afraid to listen to Norwegian heavy metal lyrics, try to get ""TNT - TNT"". The album is from 1983 and two of the songs on this album, was later translated to English and published on ""the night of the new thunder""- album; ""Eddie"", and ""U.S.A.""Norweigian music don't make it too great in onther countries, but you can also check out the band ""TinDrum"" and their number one hit ""Drums of War"""
4,Super Comfy!!,"I love the look of boots but usually find them very uncomfortable. These are very much the exception. While I didn't love the fringe, putting them on, I realized they were probably the most comfortable boots I had ever tried. They've held up well over the last 6 months and would highly recommend them."
5,Full and complete edition!,"Full and complete edition! Having read this before, I was unhappy to have found an abridged version of Heretics floating around for free on the net so I was very releaved to find this recient edtion as full as the edition I had from university, that is now fallen a part.One of Chesterton's best works, and best loved, its will worth reading AGAIN!Powerful, timeless and right on the mark."
3,C. S. Lewis improved greatly on this type of writing,"This volume collects a number of short essays written by Chesterton on social, religious, and moral topics. For a number of them you need to know the background to a particular issue of his day in order to appreciate the essay. In my view, C. S. Lewis did a much better job of writing short, pithy essays (e.g. God in the Dock) that have enduring value. However, some of Chesterton's essays are memorable and make points of enduring value."
1,"$6.99 here, or $0.00 on Gutenberg","The company asking $6.99 for this public domain book, widely available on the Web, is called BiblioBazaar.Bizarre would better fit..99 is, perhaps, reasonable for a repackaged public domain book, though really Kindle users should just find unencrypted Mobipocket files and load them using the USB to their Kindle.In the meantime, caveat emptor!"
1,can't really rate...i never got it ?,"i never got the dvd (or any e-mail responce's),so i don't know how good it is ???,maybe i can buy it elsewhere."
5,Will cars someday burn water?,"I'm a great fan of Merle Haggard, but I actually bought this cd to get the song ""Rainbow Stew"". All the songs on the cd are great though."
3,Live In Jan. 1981 in Anaheim ..,"I have the full video from this concert and so there are several songs missing from the cd version that's just too bad , because it would've made for a really good live album . The contents provided here is just half of what the video gives us . If you can get the video , get it ! If you can't , this will serve as a nice LIVE concert if you're like me and have to have the live shows on cd , but the best song on here is "" Sing Me Back Home "" . The rest is good too but you have to see the video to understand what I'm talkin' about ."
1,SUNergy Grandview Solar LED Accent Garden Yard Lights,These are really terrible yard lights. Switches don't work. A candle throws more light. Would not recommend to anyone unless you are looking for a firefly-level of lighting.
3,"Forgotton Noir Collector's Set, Arson, Inc., etc.","Loan Shark w/Raft good. They were So Young w/Scott Brady not bad. Different. Portland Expose I didn't much care for, Arson, Inc. was ok but not real bright, Shadow Man/Shoot to Kill okay. I am just used to Better Film Noir stuff. Raft is ALWAYS good.Cecy"
3,Forgotten Noir,"We've watched two so far, Portland Expose and They Were So Young. The titles and the promotional materials (seen in the Extras, including many advertisements, posters, faux newspaper clippings, seen in a scanning mode, as if a camera is looking over a collection posted on a wall) absurdly sensationalize some straightforward melodramas. They are not Noir- most of the good guys are good and the bad guys are bad,and there isn't the situation of the morally-conflicted hero, or that there isn't a moral center to the universe, as in Noir. Good-enough B films with plausible acting, if some ""Nooo don't do that! Nooo!"" teasers in the characters' choices. The two mentioned have a bit of the 'police procedural' about them, confirming that there are 'good guys' who are struggling against the bad ones. A good ""weekend-in, when the weather's nasty"" set."
1,The worse DVD transfer I've ever seen...,"... I'm a big noir buff, but come on! This film is unwatchable."
3,Looks great but the sides are floppy,We got one of these in each color for our daughter's room to store shoes in. We had a set of the smaller totes and loved them so we figuired we couldn't go wrong with the cute big totes. They are very strong and strudy and the plastic lining makes them really easy to keep clean. But the sides have no structure at all. The smaller totes come with a fabric covered cardboard piece that slides in the bottom and adds structure to it. These don't have that so the sides just flop over when there is nothing in it and they bow when there is stuff in it. They are really cute but they need some side structure or support.
3,not rigid enough,The sides flop down unless it's completely full. I have it on a shelf of my changing table and now it sticks out the front because an item pushes on it.
4,Very cute and durable,"This is a great thing to have, the only thing is that the sides are soft, I would say it's perfect to store blankets or soft, light toys. Very durable though and wipes clean inside. Great product!"
3,What about the plane?,"I am a fan of Lynn Heitmann and had been waiting a long time for this one. I read this author because her thrillers usually take place at airports or in a plane (I love airplane disaster/thriller books). THIS IS WHAT MAKES HER BOOKS DIFFERENT!!!However, this time around, although mention of planes and flying is made in passing, the crux of the action takes place on the ground - turning this thriller into yet another standard, average book.The writing was excellent and the lead character is fun. But, I was extremely disappointed by the fact that only about 15% of the book takes place in the sky."
4,The Pages Just Fly By,"Lynne Heitman's latest mystery is yet another fast, absorbing read, and she proves once again just how well she knows the innerworkings of the airline industry. She has built a fascinating, believable story around flight attendants turned prostitutes whose customers always travel in first class. And, with this saga, she takes her main character, Alex Shanahan, through the difficult first steps necessary to become a real private detective, though Shanahan seems lucky to be alive after this physically brutal adventure. It's also clear that one of Heitman's favorite new characters is a hired thug with a penchant for wildly colorful sports coats. I hope he returns for her next book."
1,Lousy Canadian Remakes,"This is one of those ""New recordings by the Original Artists"" lousy pieces of junk - Run Away......"
3,Not worth the price,"It goes on with velcro and doesn't look that great on the dash. If it actually fit snug it would be nice but for the cost, look for something that seats nice and tight."
2,dejavu all over again!,"Great book, but she loses stars for not coming up with anthing NEW or original. The concept is great, just not fair to attempt to portray these ideas as original from Sarah Ferguson! This book reminded me very much of another book, one who's central theme is self-improvement through self-motivation. The Duchess' new book talks of rewarding yourself for reaching small goals along the way. It gives verbatim examples such as a ""manicure or massage""! This book talks of ""self esteem building"" and of ""being your best friend"". This book reminded me of'Awaken the Diet Within' that has been on the market for 2 years. Well, they say imitation is the highest form of flattery! If you enjoy this book, check out the other, you judge for yourself. Or check out the website for the original, there is a ""Self Discovery Exercise"", funny, Sarah's book has a ""Self Exploration Exercise"" section--even asking you to list qualities about yourself..."

2,Not up to snuff.,I love the Tommy and Tuppence stories by Agatha Christie but this particular book was disappointing. They take over a detective agency for Mr Carter and solve cases while working on the spy case. It is like a series of short stories and not up to Agatha Christie's usual expertise.
4,Book of Excitement Andrew C.,This book is a good book to read if you like mystery books. I would want someone else to read this so that they can understand that detectives do all they can to solve the crime. Tommy is like my sister's boyfriend. He's like a very shy and cautious person. While I was reading this book I could not believe that the mystery's were about divorce cases. Tommy and Tuppence are middle aged people who are married. Another reason I would reccomand this book is because it has a lot of humor and excitement. Its just a great book about a Russian mystery. I learned some things about the book. Im going to go get more of her mystery books from the library to read.
3,I despise Tommy and Tuppence,"I like Miss Marple, I like Hercule Poirot, Superintendant Battle, Mr. Satterwhite, et al, but I do not like the Tommy and Tuppence stories. Somehow their adventures just sound a false note to me."
5,Agatha Christie's PARTNERS IN CRIME,"The detectives in this book are none other than Tommy and Tuppence Beresford, a lively husband-and-wife team who enjoy adventure.PARTNERS IN CRIME opens as most Tommy and Tuppence books do -- they are bored with life and crave adventure. Their wants are answers when The Chief visits them, and informs them of a failing detective agency. The Chief asks them to take over the failing detective agency and look for a mastermind criminal whose symbol is the number 16. Tommy and Tuppence agree, and the result is adventure and many humorous experiences.PARTNERS IN CRIME is a great example of Agatha Christie's lighter side. She placed some very funny material in the book, making it very enjoyable. I would recommend it to any Christie fan.PARTNERS IN CRIME is also worth reading just for the last line in the book, delivered by Tuppence. She says something that will force the reader to smile and say, ""Awww..."""
3,"Liked it, but Secret Adversary is Way Better","This was an enjoyable book, I will say. However, since it is a collection of strung together short stories which merge into one story, it seemed a little disconnected. It began with Tommy and Tuppence taking over a detective agency at the request of Mr. Carter, and the rest of the book until the end detailed their escapades as inexperienced detectives. I get the idea that maybe if I was more familiar with some of the older mystery books it would make more sense, because evidently Tommy and Tuppence are attempting to copy their methods.So, this was an enjoyable book with some of my favorite characters of Christie's, but I liked their first book, The Secret Adversary, better in the end."
4,Real pan for crepe lovers,I use De Buyer crepe pan for more than half a year and still like it. Don't forget to follow seasoning instructions. It truly becomes better with use. Crepes do not stick. Last time I added oil into batter and didn't use any directly on the pan - it worked fine.The only downside that it slightly warped and lost it's ideal flatness. Still good enough.Pan buying guide:[...]
1,too heavy,"very heavy indeed!! heaviest pan I've ever seen, if you like heavy, well then this is the product for you."
4,Cool phone!,"I got this for christmas and its a pretty amazing phone. It has a lot of cool features and looks awesome. Sometimes the wheel can get a bit annoying but you get used to it. Its not as great as the second version that came out of the chocolate phone, but that's just my opinion."
1,After Seeing This I Don't Know,"Well,after reading this I don't know,I am having problems already trying to recieve the phone from Verizon.I got an e-mail from Amazon saying that they shipped out but earlier today I recieved another message saying that I have to send Verizon my SSN and Driver's Licensce so right now you could say I'm pretty confused"
5,AMAZING!!!,"This phone is great. The shape and design is very sexy, and i love this color. The bottons are a little unresponsive at times, but thats once every about 20 times. THERE IS A SPEAKERPHONE!!! the camera being bad is [..]. although the phone only has a 1.3 meg, the phone never shakes so long you press the camera button on the side to take the pic. The musc quality is great as well. The one downside is that the entire face of the phone is glossy. So even if you keep in your pockets, little scratches appear quickely. Overall, if you're looking for a good phone, dont get the razr or krzr or enV, get this phone. (The color is much cooler in person, the pic above sucks."
3,Nice to look at... but a pain in the butt sometimes,"I got the chocolate about 6 months ago. It's a really cute, stylish phone, however, the touchpad is a pain in the butt and I can't use the MP3 player capability because a) I have a mac and it's not compatible and b) I don't want to pay $[...] per song through my phone. The touchpad is super sensistive, even when you reduce it to the minimum sensitivity setting. I constantly call people by accident and when I am on the phone, my cheek will brush up against the touchpad causing it to beep and go to different menu settings.I like the phone much more now that I am used to the touchpad and such."
3,Carefully measure before buying,"I will be selling my ladder at a serious discount because of the rash decision I made on the ceiling height. Measure first, buy second.The product seems plenty sturdy for my attic which is used about 6 times a year."
4,Pretty much as expected,It arrived in a timley manner and the price was good. A couple of staples were a little lose on arrival but it was no big deal. A couple raps with the hammer and it was good to go. Your standard pull down stairs. It was a bit heavy and awkard to get up inside the rafters. It would have been far easier 20 years ago when I was using a younger man's body. Smile.
1,JUST LIKE BURNED BEANS,"I have enjoyed some wonderful green tea blends. This stuff is so smokey it's just like a pot of burned beans. The taste and odor are horrendous. If you like scotch or very blackened foods, you might like this tea, but it's nothing like a typical green leaf tea."
5,goggles,like these.....my little dog is getting use to them....at first she would try to take them off....but once I got them adjusted she wore them for awhile....
3,lens are easy to mark up,worked good at first she is still getting used to them trys to remove them. one note of advice remove the lens till they get used to them the lens plastic is so soft that she scratched them by head diving in the grass. will not buy anymore unless they do something about how soft the lens plastic is. this was within 20 min of removeing them from plastic adjusting them and letting her go outside.
5,Doggles,Doggles are a great product. They are well made and easy to put on my dog. Even though she doesn't like them at this point they do look really cute and keep the wind out of her eyes when we drive with the convertible top down. :)
5,Decouvrez Biolay!,"This is another superb effort from one of the world's premiere songwriters. Understanding French is a plus, but certainly not necessary to enjoy Biolay's work. While not quite showing the scope & occasional bombast of A L'Origine, his last work, the melodies are predictably superb & the songs well delivered & produced. An excellent product & fine place to start for those interested in discovering exceptional songwriting."
5,New Century Design,This just arrived to go with the flatware Millenium set and it is perfect with the set: just the right weight and of course the design which is ultra-modern is the same. I have ordered other pieces from Replacements on the Internet and this sure beats those prices.Highly recommend to those who seek the modern and the unusual!
4,one of the finest compilations,"ONE OF THE FINEST COMPILATIONS OF ONE OF THE GREATEST PRIMA BALLERINAS TO COME OUT OF RUSSIA.EARLY CLIPS IN BLACK AND WHITE ARE TO BE EXPECTED.ALSO MANY MOMENTS FROM SOVIET BLACK & WHITE TELEVISION. DO NOT LET THIS DETER YOU. WHAT YOU ARE GETTING IS BLACK & WHITE SOLID GOLD ., THE LAST PIECE (IN COLOR), SHOWS EARLY EXAMPLES OF RUSSIAN EXPERIMENTAL DANCE. ITS UP TO THE INDIVIDUALS TASTE WHETHER TO ENJOY IT , OR NOT."
1,Gotta speak Russian!,"Of course fabulous ballerina--Maya is the greatest. However, the pieces filmed for this video are kind of filmy and hollywoodish. My major beef is that the conversations are in Russian with no English sub-titles."
4,Functional Bike Rack - With some Warnings,"I purchased this rack to carry Medical First Aid Supplies on a 180 mile, 2 day bike ride (I am a Paramedic riding as a medic). The rack was completely functional, and I used it successfully on my Canondale road bike. There are, however three issues that need to be published to potential buyers using road bikes:1. The metal teeth on the inside of the clincher are dangerous for use on carbon fiber seat posts (might damage the post).2. The size of the seat post clincher is wide for a narrow road bike seat, and rubbed against my legs during the ride. (not too bad)3. The rack with a load will change the weight distribution to the rear on the bike, and standing up on the pedals on a climb will cause the bike to fishtail slightly more than normal. (I was able to compensate after a couple of hours and minimized this problem)"
4,Nice Looing Rack,"I bought this rack a few months ago. So far it's worked great in a tight spot when its a must I carry something extra in tow, such as extra books from the library. Official and nice looking and it's very light-weight. Easy to assemble on the bike. My only drawback is that it moves a bit if you don't give it a firm twist of the screw. I'm OCD when it comes to things looking perfect and lined up on my bike."
2,"Good idea, but not for me","Thought this would be handy on my ride but it didn't end up being what I hoped for. It might work for light duty, perhaps a windbreaker or your lunch, but keep the box until you're sure.My wife & I ride around quite frequently and as such, it's a pain in the back to carry the two locks & cables that we need when locking up here in NYC. (For the record, the Kryptonite 18mm New York Fahgettaboudit U-Lock, the Kryptonite Kryptolok Series 2 U-Lock, and the Kryptonite KryptoFlex 7' cable. I'll leave the total weight as an exercise for the reader!)Anyhow, I tried using this to bungee the locks to, in order to avoid rattling and loss and back pain on or extended rides. The clamp seemed solid, but on several occasions the rack swiveled around, becoming off-center and sticking out to the side. Also, the weight of the locks seemed too much for the rack, as it bounced up and down violently as I rode, even over seemingly smooth ground."
4,good for full-suspension,"I used to have this for my old bike (that got stolen) and I'm getting it again for my new one.I have a rack mainly because I like to and/or need to carry stuff with me, much as any other biker needs a rack for.However, fixed racks do not work with full suspension bicycles and this is the only fix for that (that I know of). Granted, serious 'extreme' mountain-bikers do not want a rack (but then you wouldn't be lookin at this if you weren't)--it is quick-release though which allows you to remove it whenever you don't need/want it for whatever reason.My only complaint is the inability to mount a rear-light on it (easily), because most rear-lights mount to the seat post, which in this case is taken up by the rack. Do-it-yourselfers of course could make a rig to do just that.I would suggest getting some kind of cargo-net in conjunction with this to secure things on it, or perhaps latch on a crate of some kind if you need even more cargo area."
2,A little disappointed,"While we love the idea of a quick-release bike rack for our son so that he can look cool when he's not riding home from school with his books, we are disappointed that the rack will not stay tight. The quick release latch is stripped and won't tighten any further. The rack freely moves from side to side, causing his books/gear to repeatedly fall off on a normal ride on a sidewalk, not on rough terrain. I wish I could have it replaced or refunded."
2,Doesn't fit any of my 3 bikes,"We have 3 bikes in the house, all 20+ year old cruisers, with various size frames and seat posts. It didn't occur to me that this rack might actually not fit any of them, but it turns out that all the seat posts are too small for this rack. When I actually busted out the calipers and measured them, the seat posts are all smaller than 24 mm. Go figure.Lesson learned: measure twice, order once (or don't order at all)."
4,Delta Mega Rack Post Haste Quick Release,I just purchased a new mtn. bike and I needed a rack that could handle a med. storage bag so I could ride to the gym. I highly recommend this product since it is a managable size. It is made of good quality alum. material and is easy to install. I only wish it came with a reflector. The reflector used to come with the rack but for some reason it was deleted from the bill-of-materials.
4,Super Reader,"Highly amusing tongue in cheek romp by Farmer. An over the hill Sherlock is brought out of bee-keeping retirement to hunt down an arch-villain with a potential food destroying super virus, during World War I. With trusty off-sider, of course.Holmes has a significant problem in that he has never been in a plane before, and they have to cross the world to chase the bad guy. Much air-sickness ensues (and no cocaine). However, their pilots turn out to be Richard Wentworth and Lamont Cranston!Then of course, there is their African connection.Light, fast, and entertaining foray through Farmer's Wold Newton imaginings."
5,This is one book!!,I loved this book!! When the Hardy Boys get boring read this book!!! I loved it!! It starts off wheen Jupiter wins a cat and then a man steals it!! This story does not let you figure out what is reason of the crooked cat!! I think any kid can read this since it was soo good you don't put it down and you r on your toes all the time!! This is the best book ever and evryone will give it 5 stars unless they r some weirdo lookin 4 trouble but as i say this is one major crisis if someone says this book is bad i mean who could say that to a good lovin bbok!!!
4,One of the best bands from the '80s!,"Best cuts include Two Solitudes (really great song), Children Say, Running in the Family and of course, Something About You. It's one album you should have in your collection."
5,Songs you never get tired of...,I went through most of my teenage years listening to that great album and the songs still move me when I hear them. It's amazing to see they've managed to create songs that give you the impression they have been written for you and they are telling you truths about your own life. It's really a shame the band did split !
5,Good Exciting Read,"Right mixture of adventure, danger and romance. Mixture of plot lines through out the story never got boring or predictable."
4,The Mountain Valley War (Kilkenny),The fans of Louis L'Amour's work should like this book. Like most of his work he offers the reader the right amount of descriptive material so that it doesn't detract from the storyline.
5,I liked this video on technique,I am an artist/painter of 20 years and I got a lot out of this video. Sometimes a little technique can give you your own break through!
4,Beginners only,"This book is great for the beginning acrylic painter...but useless for the seasoned one. After painting in acrylic for a space of time, we learn all that was in this book. Of course that's probably true of every medium."
5,THE Macbeth,"I have given this dvd to all of my opera friends. It is superb theatre and Verdi singing, the likes of which we will likely not hear again.Kostas Paskalis(R.I.P.)is completely Macbeth, every expression ricocheting between lust for ""la corona"" and impending madness. His final aria makes me weep no matter how often I have seen it.The despair and crushing weight of his fate is so overwhelming it is hard to watch. The voice is unique among baritones; full of color and the ability to spin out a soft tone. Haunting.The production should be mandatory viewing for all of today's dirctors. Verdi is the creator, not the ""director"".Patrick C. Byrne"
5,Brilliance!...,"I first listen to this album when I was in Brazil. It opened new horizons for me. Its textures, harmonies, rhythms, acoustics were all new. Since then (1992) I have collected all albums from this group and I have never disappointed. It's a must for music lovers like me."
2,A proof Reader?,"So many typing errors and appallingly badly spelt words (eg throaght which I assume was meant to be throat). The author really should have run it by a friend who could spell at least.Lots of ideas but many illogical, forcing different ideas into an order to make a story. The characters are not well built and their behaviours without proper motivation.Small book but hard to follow.Shame I like the idea of grown up faery stories but a children's story at least has logic even if more simple than this tale."
1,You'll be sorrrrry!,"This thing, as a polite term, is cheap and poorly made. If you do not intend to sit in it but rather, use it as a visual piece for selling a house, this may be for you. Otherwise, save your hard earned money! Shortly after using it a weld cracked. I am not huge or hold elephants in my lap. This left the chair unstable and made impossible to drink coffee while seated.Regarding the weld failure, I understand that stuff from china needs help. I paid to have that repaired at a machine shop. The welder said it was just soft steel. In my opinion, this is a short term product and is produced to be sold. Repeat customers? That's a laugh. Without reservation I can say that I wouldn't buy another mac product; ever. Almost omitted this....whatever cushioning the seat provided when new soon evaporated. No kidding, it's a joke (on consumers)!"
2,Too expensive for what you get,"Within a week the chair screws were breaking the wood and it is wobbling. I don't expect stellar results from anything, but for $500 I'd like to think it wouldn't be having problems this soon. The quality of the chair is questionable for even $200."
