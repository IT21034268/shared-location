1,terrible quality,"I bought a light baby blue color. After the 1st wash, I used these pillow cases. The weirdest thing happened... they got ""bleach spots"". I don't know if it had to do with the fabric blend and my hair but it was the weirdest thing. That never happened to me before. :( Bummed out because they were so pretty and so soft and smooth."
5,This is going to be one of the best games in history!,"Jak 3 is a game to go down in the history books! I've read all about it in magazines and it is going to be awsome. Now Jak has a light eco to balance out his dark eco. The light eco has healing powers and whatnot, but don't worry, you can still turn into the rampaging dark Jak. And with Daxter and Pecker along you know it is going to be hilarious! It's a must buy!"
5,Totally worth every penny,"I only bought the game again because my copies of the trilogy were stolen a while back and I kept having nostalgic moments of the games, but I'm so glad I re-bought them. Since they arrived, which was 2 days before the estimate, I've replayed em like 4 times. FYI to all those who buy this, the default sticks are inverted so it takes a while to get used to unless you figure out they can be changed to inverted (which is normal mode in every other game)."
5,#Game_Master#,"This game is the most fun game i EVER played..I've played the two last ones and this IS THE BEST.These are the reasons why u should buy this game.(1)Fun Game-play not too hard not too easy.(2)Awesome graphics(Excellent Artifical Intelligence).(3)A hand full of different weapons(Weapons have mods).(4)Very good fighting tec..(Dark Jak and Light Jak)(5)Perfect Story, very detailed and interesting.*To understand the story i suggest playing the prior games."
5,Wait a minute!,I just wrote a review for this game and after writing it I decided to see what people thought of it... Alot of people thought it was awesome. But then again there was some people who absolutley hated it! You know what that really isn't true what they say because I found the game quite entertaining. So R AND C fans say that it was copied from Jak 3. Hey I haven't even played the game but I watched my brother play the demo for it and I can already tell that it sucks. I don't even want to go near it. Yes I could agree that the car missions were stupid but the game plot was perfect and the graphics were fine. There is one more thing that did kind of make my mind think. They changed the voice for Kiera and animation and does Jak like her or not! I mean I thought he did in the first two games.So that is my final review. From die hard fan WitchChild
2,Who's copying who?,"Some people say Ratchet has been copying Jak. Well who had upgradeable weapons first? Ratchet. Who had vehicle missions first? Ratchet. Who has the best missions? Ratchet. Who has the nerdiest characters? Jak. Who has the most frustrating missions? Jak. Who is the copier? Jak. Save your money, go Ratchet. (Note: Jak3 is stupid. They swear, there is suggestive themes, not a gift for little Jimmy)"
1,yawn.. JAK III will be as uninspiring as JAK II,"Simply put, JAK II was a poor rip off of Grand Theft Auto and Tony Hawk as a platformer. This time, you get to play for awhile in the Wasteland desert, then it is back the City to reuse those assets.With some many other more impressive games coming out this season, for example Halo 2, why waste money on this boring game."
1,do not get!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,never get this game!!it is basiccally running around hitting things with a tool!!it is also REALLY stupid to see jak transforming into light jak (...)
2,Jak 2 + Jak X = Jak 3,"I was greatly disappointed by this game. It is essentially Jak 2 plus Jak X. You still have the same Haven City layout (which even exists in ""Daxter"" for the PSP) and, for the most part, the same weapons. I bought this for my 7-year-old son and he finished it in less than one week. If you have Jak 2, you've pretty much seen Jak 3."
4,pretty bloody awsome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This thing was cool. only problem was at the end, it gets kind of boring. it was still cool. defernitly better than Jak and Daxter:the precurser legacy and JakII."
4,great game but easy to beat,"this game is very fun. new weapons and new dark/light jak moves. but this game was so easy i beat it in 3 days. thank god i rented it! also, some of the missions are incredibly repetitive. it is either ""get to this point before the clock runs out"" or ""go to the waste land and waste time"" this game takes 0 skill. and forget about hand-to-hand combat, i found myself using a weapon for 99.9% of the game.GOOD-weapons-dark/light jak moves-cooler vehicles-new enemys-bigger cityBAD-too easy-crappy missions-not many areas to use your dark/light powershope you liked my review!"
3,Good game....but...,"I have the same feelings about this game as I had about Jak 2. Great game but the language turned me off. I have young daughters who love Jak and Daxter but I don't like the language. As far as the game goes, it is better than Jak 2."
2,not too hot,"I was really considering getting this game, but i got this demo for it and honestly, it doesn't deliver. I'm reading all these reviews about how ooohhhh it's so fun, and then i played it and was like are you kidding me. The graphics really aren't that good, the missions i did play were just boring and frustrating. And what in the world was someone saying about rachet copying jak and daxter. Hhhmmm let me think in goin commando ratchet's weapons included upgrades, and hey what happend in Jak 3, oh yah his weapons now have upgrades too, wow what a coincidence."
1,Stinker,"I really liked the first two Jak games, so I was excited to try Jak 3. Whoa. Major mistake. This game is nothing more than a lame racing-wannabe. I was very disappointed in this game. If you are expecting a platformer, look elsewhere."
2,Jak 3 come-on,"(im 15years-old not 13years-old)I buy ever game even kid games but jak 3 come on.you kids go buy it.But no,t me.I gave my jak 3 to my 9 year old brother."
3,Jak3,"Let me start off with saying the kid's review, do not get!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!, makes me want to get it because I like to destroy stuff. the second game was cool but to me it seems inpocible at times I have the book to the 2nd on and I'm still stuck at the near beginning were you fly the people around. well i think u should rent the game first and see if you like it."
5,jak 3!!!!!!!,"jak 3 is going to be the best its going to have darkjak/lightjak ,12 gun mods,dunebuggys,hovergliders,hanggliders,and more.Also when your light jak you can fly,self heal,and freeze time."
3,It's fun......,"It's a fun game I bought it breand new for around 5 bucks the only problem I have with it is that it stoped my ps2 not froze, (stoped it) it just stoped working I had to unplug my ps2 just to get it to work agian afer the 4th time I have not had a problem with it (yet) but we will see"
4,Jak3,"I purchased this game for my 14 year old son. He liked the game, he thought it was better then the second one but not as good as jak and daxter itself. The only complaint I heard from him was he said it was a bit too easy."
5,Awesome,"This game is going to be the best in the series. i reccomend it more than its competitor, Ratchet and Clank, not that its bad, its just not as good as Jak 3. I have heard rumours that there will be a Jak 4, i don't believe it because all good theings have to end."
4,Awesome!,"I love this game! there is so much to do and now Jak can become ""Light Jak"" with energy shields, wings to fly, regenerating energy etc. I like how the wastelanders aren't like the Krimzom Guards in Jak II, because if you bug them, they don't send a million people after you, they just get even! ^_^;;By the way, to all those people who say this game sucks or that Ratchet and Clank is better, too bad for you. oh sorry, i must have missed the reason that you are reviewing on this then."
3,"Okay, I guess.....","I was so excited when I got this game. I remebered it taking forever for me to beat jak2. Yeah, well, this one took me about 3 days. Some of the missions are frustrating, hard, and slow. Don't get me wrong, most are great. The story line was good, most gameplay good. But what really dissapointed me was the ending. It was the stupidest thing I have ever witnessed on the PS2. Suddenly I felt very empty inside. The end ruined it. This is a renter, not a buyer. If you must buy, wait and save some money."
4,A Review,"This game was really fun, and a lot easier than Jak 2. Where in Jak 2 many of the missions i got through with pure dumb luck this game was much easier mainly because of the addition of light jak powers, especially the healing ability. Though i was a bit mad that they changed some of dark jaks powers but ohh well. That and the game was really short, i think i beat it in 16-18 hrs, with a decent amount of going through and trying to find precursor and orbs and the like. The dune buggies are awesome just because they're so fun to go drive around in. Again many of the missions really werent that hard, and the final boss only took me two tries to beat...mainly because my controller died on the first time and i walked off the edge...stupid controller. Neway once again this game is cake compared to Jak 2, id strongly suggest buying it especially because it has a great story and wraps up the trilogy quite well"
3,Not a bad game,My son plays it every now and again and says its fun. Not a real big challenge and a easy game to defeat he said but fun.
5,Jak 3,"I have been gathering all the info on this game until this day the game has finally came out. Even though I have not played this game yet but I know it will be EXTREMELY AWESOME. And now that Jak has got new abilities, for example, light Jak, new powers for dark Jak, and new abilities for your guns."
5,Excellent Graphics!Challenging levels!Thrilling Gameplay!!!!,This Rocks!!!!My Favorite!!!!!!!It does have Some swears in it though.But it is still cool!The Precursors are FAT and skinny versions of Daxter!!!!OOOOOOOOOOOOOOPS!!!I blew the secret.Just Buy IT!!!!!!
3,A decent game...,"ok start the yelling, i'm a person who dislikes horror movies. at times, thats what Jak 3 is. there is plenty of comic releif in this game, but sometimes i just don't feel right when i play dark missions. any one remember the mission in jak 2 where you had to clear krews underground smuggling rout? i am a big fan of the series, so i'm not telling you to not get the game, but for people like me out there, be warned. if your like me, save this money to get a different game (wink wink) like Rachet and clank up your arsanel..."
1,Jak3 is a Horrible Game,I am 8 years old and I rented Jak3. I liked Ratchetand Clank Up Your Arsenal a lot more than Jak3. I thoughtJak3 was very hard and bad and it was not fun. I played for five days and I could not get past the first battle.You should definitely rent Jak3 before you buy it.
2,topics covered are great but loses 3 stars because of ...,"glaring mistakes all over the book.i've found at least 3 wrong definition of convexity in the book. some contradicing within a paragraph. wow do some proof reading?along with wrong definition for implicit function theorem in chapter 1 - missing minus sign in front.and look at page where they talk about epigraph and subgraph. and ... you get the point.i can't believe it has such basic definitions wrong.not to mention uncommon notations used for some analysis...not happy with the book.for optimization stick with Stephen Boyd, Bertsekas, or Luenberger.and for applying optimization tech to economics get simon, and blume2 stars might not seem a big deal to you but look at my rating history.i rarely go under 4 stars.stay away from this book. although if the author fixes those deluge of stupid mathematical mistakes this book has a potential to be 5 stars."
5,Very self contained,"This is a very readable introduction to optimisation that should appeal to a wide audience, althouh it is mainly aimed at economics students.The subject is presented from very elementatry notions up, so if you have gaps in your calculus, this book is very likely to fill them.The author bends over backwards to make the proofs clear.It must be stressed that this is just an introduction, so people looking for an explanation of numerical methods such as Newton's method or derived methods won't find them here.I originally got a book with missing pages near the end and found this out rather late. The publisher replaced my copy."
3,Not Quite What I Was Looking For,"David Bowie is a brilliant genius with brilliant music, but this book does not quite follow in his footsteps. While it includes many good songs, the singles included just are not his best songs. But that's not my real complaint. My real complaint is that it is only notated and not in tablature. Many people have trouble reading a book that has no tablature, and ( i can read music, but tab much faster) many are delayed by having to turn one into the other. Also the piano, guitar 1, guitar 2, etc. parts are not well enough defined. I wish that they would make an effort a more extensive collection of this legend, but also that they would please do a tablature version. I know i would certainly buy it, being a collector and all. I'm not saying don't buy it, just beware before you do that it's not in tablature."
2,The Last Virgin,"Wel, as a 13 year old girl, the title f the book obviously attracted me, however this book was disappointing. I like books 2 engross me, and this one certainly didn't. I would, however, highly recommend Kate Cann!"
2,"Memorable subject, horrible cinematography","This is one of the most visually annoying films I've ever seen. The director intersperses between interviews with the surviving Catonsville 9 activists dizzying (and literally nauseating) highspeed segments of red flowers and streets that make you feel as if you're on a roller-coaster or acid. Repeated blurred, out-of-focus shots of newspaper print add to the general visual cacaphony, and it all gets in the way of telling the marvelous, brave story of the witness for peace that took place at Catonsville in 1968. The interviews and original footage are important. For those with technical skills, I'd suggest buying the film and re-editing it to eliminate the distracting visual craziness. If you do that, the film deserves 5 stars."
5,"Amazing ""firebusting"" trucks, helicopters, planes and boats","This video is for any child who loves firetrucks, helicopters, airplanes, boats and great music. The narrator takes the children on a tour of a fire station (it happens to be Bainbridge Island's) and explains what firefighters do there. He does a great firetruck rap before the video goes to amazing scenes of ""firebusting"" helicopters carrying huge buckets of water, airplanes scooping water from lakes and dropping it on forest fires and fireboats (in Seattle) shooting water on Elliot Bay. These segments are accompanied by wonderful classical music. Finally, the children will enjoy a fire safety fair hosted at the fire station complete with clowns and information on what to do in a fire situation. This video is number one on my children's all-time favorite video list."
1,Avoid this one! A real turkey,"This one may amuse the youngest child for about ten minutes. Adults will find it quite painful. The host is annoying and offers very little info about the subject. There is a seemingly endless rap song about fire engines which insults the intelligence of any above the age of two. There are some clips of firefighting set to some decent music---these are OK: at least the hostis not involved. My toddler has about six ""real life"" firefighter videos and this is by far the worst."
4,Wild! Like a trip back into my childhood.,As a young girl in the 60's I played with many of the outfitspictured in this book. It is both nostalgic andfuturistic. Mr. Varaste has done an exceptional job with the photography. Highly recommended.
5,So detail oriented~,"This book is PERFECT for the advanced collector. Going thru each style of BARBIE from Ponytails thru TNT's. If you are looking for price guides, this is not the book for you. If you are wondering what the difference between white ginger and platinum bubbles, or what year TNT's had centered eyes, or to just drool over totally mint rare dolls, THIS IS FOR YOU! I really like it."
3,A good way to start learning Arabic,"The program is excellent for learning pronunciation, good for grammar rules, but confusing with its written English version of Arabic grammar"
1,Egyptian Arabic Vocab Clinic,I am studying colloquial Egyptian Arabic now with private tutors In Cairo online. So far 95 percent of the words I have looked up on the Egyptian Arabic Vocab Clinic are not included. Arabic script cannot be used to specific searches either.I do not like the product so far.Robert Leifels
4,Good Movies,"I have all of the first five that have come out. I have enjoyed watching all of them. And they all have Tom Selleck in them, big plus..."
5,First in the series,"If you started this series with ""Stone Cold"" and then watched ""Night Passage"", you may think that this should have been the first to come out. I don't know why they made ""Stone Cold"" first, but it doesn't matter as I am on my second time around watching this great series in order."
5,Jesse Stone Night Passage,"Have all the Jesse Stone series and hope they produce more, Tom Selleck is writting and producing a a a"
4,First in the series - not a bad start,"I hoped the movie would do justice to the story. It almost does. The problem is not with Tom Selleck - he's perfect for the part. The problem lies in the way the story was butchered to make the film. They could have done much better - hell, I probably could have done better and I've never written a script. Still it was good and entertaining."
4,Jesse Stone prequel,"I really liked this prequel in the series with its flawed yet philosophical protagonist, and its gritty but amiable tone. Tom Selleck is perfect in the role. His motivations and fish out of water circumstances are set up nicely, and I truly want to know how he will do in this new environment. Will he continue down the road to isolation and alcoholism? Or will he find new life in this small community? The crimes are interesting, too, but it's the characterization and relationship issues that make this special."
3,Something Done Well,"John Updike famously said, ""Ted Williams is the classic ballplayer of the game on a hot August weekday, before a small crowd, when the only thing at stake is the tissue-thin difference between a thing done well and a thing done ill."" That's how I feel about Jesse Stone, another Californian transplanted to New England. Ted Williams didn't pay much attention to fielding, but what he did pay attention to, he did very well. The ""Jesse Stone"" movies don't do everything well, but when it comes to producing character-driven, moody, exquisitely paced, hard-boiled entertainment, they do very well. One of my favorite aspects of ""Night Passage is how it takes the time to tell the story well. The relationship between Boomer and Jesse is presented to us patiently and effectively. Also, ""Night Passage"" pays attention to detail. One of my favorite moments in the movie is when one of the characters hands a cup of coffee to another character. Satisfying storytelling."
5,Jesse Stone Night Passage DVD Movie,"What can I say? Love the Jesse Stone movies and bought a bunch-in series-so I could watch them over and over again. Good Plots, good actors and who doesn't love Tom Selleck? Good Price too"
4,Jesse Stone DVD,"I love the pace of this series... No loud music, no cursing, just the way movies used to be made when movies were actually movies and not just for teenagers. Selleck makes the perfect Jesse Stone"
4,TOM AS ALCOHOLIC JESSE?,"It's difficult for me to follow this movie, mainly because I have a tough time picturing Tom Selleck as weak, alcoholic, depressed Jesse Stone. But being a great actor, he pulls it off. The other reviewers have covered this one thoroughly as well as the other Jesse Stone movies. In this story, Jesse loses his job as a homicide detective with the LAPD, and is divorced by his wife (from whom he never quite recovers), over drinking and unreliability. Jesse ends up in Paradise, Mass. as the new police chief who isn't suppsoed to do much in the realm of crime-fighting. But Jesse jumps into the corruption and dirty town secrets, and we have a story. I liked the movie OK, but still not sure about Tom playing this role."
5,Tom Selleck IS Stone,"Tom Selleck is always interesting to watch and add in the fact that these films are well made, well written and well acted, one could become addicted to the Jesse Stone stories. I wish there were more of them."
2,"All Atmosphere, No Plot","I kept waiting for this picture to get moving, but it never did. There is a lot of atmosphere and a lot of meaningful brooding, but nothing ever actually happens. As a result, the pacing of this film is painfully slow. We don't get anything like a story until nearly the very end, when Stone stumbles across the money-laundering scheme. Of course, part of the reason everything is so slow is that the filmmakers jettisoned the biggest part of Robert B. Parker's plotline. The money laundering is strictly secondary in the book. It's as if they did ""Mutiny on the Bounty"" without the mutiny. On the plus side, Selleck is excellent, and so is the rest of the cast, but they are torpedoed by the molasses-in-January pace and excess atmospherics. It's hard to believe the same director made the other two Jesse Stone pictures. Those two are excellent; ""Night Passage"" is not."
2,not just god or bad,"I like the Jesse Stone books.but this telling shows only a slight resemblance to the story.I really like Tom Selleck, but the changes are more then I like,some needed to fit Mr.Selleck.but others were just P.C.and still others,well I don't know why, maybe because it was just a way to make it fit.as a movie, it was just ok. but if you read the book before, it really doesn't measure up."
3,small town sheriff,This movie is entertaining but lacks much action. Could also do without the star being a drunk and shown drinking all the time. This is not good for children due to the drinking issue.
4,prequel to the 1st entry in the series...,"although this was the second ""Jesse Stone"" film released, in the story-line this is the 1st entry in the series, since it is the prequel to the first release, ""Stone Cold"".this installment shows the viewer how Stone became police chief of Paradise, Massachusetts. Formerly, he was a homicide detective working for the L.A.P.D. He was kicked off that job due to his alcoholism, drinking on the job. He is estranged from his wife.A new chapter in his life opens when he gets a chance to interview for the now open position of police chief in Paradise, Massachusetts, a small fishing village.To his surprise, he gets the job. A few days later, he learns that the former police chief has recently died, of an apparent suicide. The case seems to be ""open and shut"", but Stone has his doubts."
2,Annoying writing style,"Overall this book was helpful to me in reviewing for the GMAT exam. Unfortunately the author had a hideous writing habit that he used throughout the book. As he would explain various topics he would add additional letters to particular words. For example: ""..."" At first I thought this was a typo, but it occurs on page after page with different words and is terribly distracting. I can't believe an editor would let this get through. I don't know if this was meant to be cute or what, but it is just...annoying.Additionally, for a book that is obviously designed for those of us who are clueless about algebra, Mr Miller would often start off explaining new topics by stating something to the effect that he once thought this topic was hard, but now he doesn't nor do his students, so the reader should do super well. Excuse me, but if algebra came easily to me I wouldn't have bought this book!"
1,More Confused Than Before,"Miller is very convinced that he is a great teacher. He spends a good deal of this book telling you that he is. I however have to disagree.Whenever I tried to learn a concept from this book, I always ended up more confused than when I started. When he derives equations he introduces unnecessary and complicated steps that ultimately contribute nothing to the solution. His descriptions of the functions are confusing and regularly use terms he has not introduced. The values chosen for the examples easily could have been ones that would clearly illustrate the principles being taught, but for some reason Miller usually chose the few values that didn't clearly illustrate anything.On the plus side he makes notes of which sections will be on the Math SAT. So, if you are practicing for the SATs, you may find that helpful."
2,Not really good for the clueless,"Just once I would love to open an Algebra text and find in the first chapter on the first pages and explaination of WHAT THE HECK ALGEBRA IS, AN WHAT ITS FOR, AND HOW IT FITS INTO THE WHOLE WORLD OF MATHEMATICS.This book offers nothing new in technique or content. In itself its not a ""bad"" text, it just does not excel in any way that would cause you to say ""this is great for beginners etc"" It is however a good quick review for those accomplished in Algebra at one time and need to just review."
4,Nice bags to work with,"I made pockets and sewed them on and I embroidered designs on the pockets and on the bags. The fabric is easy to work with and the bags are great for reusable shopping bags or taking stuff to the gym or the beach. I'd buy them again. The shipping was kind of high and I was charged for each bag, even though they all came from the same manufacturer."
2,Pink Glow,"This mirror casts a pink glow. I removed the plastic pieces that covered the bulbs and that helped somewhat, but it is still there. I have trouble adjusting it so I can see myself when it sits on my makeup counter."
2,Not Fully Working,The left bulb didn't work so it was replaced with a new one and it still didn't work. I'm not sure it ever did.
2,little mirror,"This makeup mirror is okay. It was a little smaller than I expected. But, that just means it takes up less space."
5,Christmas Gift,Goes perfectly with the stuffed Babar and Queen Celeste dolls that I gave my granddaughters. It's just the beginning of their adventures.
4,Babar is cool,"I am 14, and I still like Babar. It is high quality, eexcept for the fact that he married his cousin, Celeste. Then he takes advantage of a rich old lady, and has her buy him stuff. And the king died by eating a bad mushroom. It's a good book, but slightly inappropriate."
5,The way to the forest where we belong,"I find it an outrage that older people pretend to have forgotten how it feels when a vile hunter kills your mother elephant. The page of The Story of Babar, the Little Elephant where this base crime was commited used to be wet with tears. Of course, there were four of us, aged three to eight, repeatedly reading about this despicable deed, and unfailingly shocked to tears. But on the next page, the city was so much like the one which roared across our windows. The younger amongst us would not have found it extraordinary to come across an elephant in Paris, and the older ones knew that there was a direct way from our native city to the forest where, as elephants, we did belong. Yet, how come we forgot is a deep mystery. But still, I know the way to the forest: come hither, I show you..."
1,Imperialistic propaganda at its best (or worst)?,"I second what one of the reviewers said about the imperialistic propaganda.My husband recalled reading this book as a child, so when my mother-in-law got it for my daughter, I was delighted. So, I read it today for the first time and was utterly horrified at the blatant propaganda in it! Wow, it scares me to think that the book is a classic and that a few generations grew up reading it! I'm returning it to the nearest used book store. I'm sure my daughter is too young to pick up on the offensive things as I do, but there is tons of kind and cute literature for children out there, so why bother reading this (on a personal note, I did not find the book either charming or delightful, but rather tedious and boring, offensive things aside)?"
1,Disturbing...,"We received this book as a gift for our 3 yr old. I read it to her and it was really disturbing. Other reviews have noted that it must be read ""in context"" as far as the time it was written. I disagree - when was a child's viewing a mother's brutal murder (Babar seeing his mother being shot before his eyes) ever appropriate fare for a little child? Then, Babar has to run for his life and later on in the book, there is another death. Also, Babar is surprised when his cousins have no clothes - this is upsetting to him. I find it offensive - elephants don't need to be like people - they don't need clothes. I don't see the charm in this book at all. I don't see the attraction. One thing -- Babar marrying his cousin is the one thing that is not shocking - its not like incest, like brother and sister or like they grew up together -- people have been marrying cousins for thousands of years - up until at least the beginning of this century - hardly immoral."
2,Not What I Remembered,I remembered how much I loved Babar growing up so I thought I'd get it for my 5 yr old and 19 month old. Babar's mother is shot and killed at the beginning of the book and another elephant dies later of food poisoning. Not the cuddly elephant book I had hoped for. Weird what a difference 40 years can make on one's perspective.
1,Reconsidering the classics,"We all know how nice it is to share a book from our own youth with our child. But take time out to re-read Babar as an adult -use your adult judgement, apply your morals and beliefs to this book. You will not need to dig very deep to see that this story is based on unabashed imperialism. It is, in fact, offensive. I am not saying that you should not go ahead and read it to your child. But do have a discussion with him or her about what Babar learns from the lady, his relationship with his mother and his bride. As for myself, I am just not buying this one."
1,pretty scary for a young child,"I purchased this book thinking that Babar is one of the great classics and how much my 4 year old would love it. Well, I'm glad I read it first. The first thing that happens to Babar is that his mother is killed by poachers. How frightening is that for a young child? Then, left alone in the world, he goes off on his own, has wonderful adventures (the part of the book that's fine) only to come back and marry his cousin. Well, those are not the sorts of things that I'm willing to expose my young children to."
1,Mother gets shot and dress for success themes,"We are getting rid of this book at a garage sale. Mother shot, odd story does nothing for the mind and teaches nothing of value-- sad too as pictures are great-- but this crazy tale goes out the door with joy."
2,Great for young people,"This book might be more appropriately filed under 'young readers'. First, it is a small book, hardly more than a paperback. Second, it does not go into any depth about Chinese houses, but gives more of a conversational style overview of culture and history. Illustrations are few and far between. There are no plans, elevations, or serious architectural drawings. Any seventh grader with a report due should be thrilled to find this book. Anyone else will be left wanting. How odd - it is an Oxford University publication."
4,"""A Haunting"" from the past","I am a sucker for ghost stories and all types of hauntings, so this has been one of my all time favorite shows. I am so pleased to have the entire series on dvd now. Looking back at it now, some of the ""ghost"" images are obviously fake, and almost cheesy if you will, but back when it was on air, there were no other shows out there like it. To this day, certain episodes still give me goosebumps and make me second guess how badly I need to use the restroom in the middle of the night lol!It's new brother show ""The Haunted"" on the Animal Planet is pretty much the same, but with a spin on including how hauntings how an affect on our pets. I was very disappointed when ""A Haunting"" was cancelled, but am quite pleased that they this a new series out. Check that one out too!"
4,Like it!,This collection is my favorite simply because most of the stories are first hand accounts reinacted. The only annoying thing is the way that the introduction music starts over and over each time a new story begins. If you fast forward through that the stories are really quite frightening.
5,Awesome compilation!,"If you liked watching the series on TV, you'll love having seasons 1-4 at your fingertips! The extra features are also great. Overall, I loved it."
4,I'm definately gonna love this,I'm definately going to love this series as I give it a chance to order it and view it on my old DVD' drives.
4,Good show,"Pro: came new & got it for a good price for the full season plus pilot.Con: slooooowwwwww processing & slooooowwwwww snail mail delivery. 2 weeks to be exact.Other thoughts: I don't understand why they wait a week before proccessing the order & shipping it out. This makes me just want to order from somewhere else & be done with it. I don't know if this is a way to let customer change their mind & cancel or what since you can cancel before it ships, reminds me of ordering from a catalog."
3,Kind of a letdown...but at least I got a good deal on it at the time,"Wasn't nearly as creepy or scary as I was hoping for, especially after reading other reviews. The acting was a little cheesy.I guess what is scary to some isn't always as scary to others. Of course, I may be somewhat desensitized to scary stuff as I am a huge horror fan and have been watching horror movies and such since I was 5 or so: I'm 29 now."
1,NON?,These are just horror stories being marketed as non-fiction. They do not even aspire to the level of the insipid investigations performed by SyFy's Ghost Hunters.
4,Repetative but cool,"I like this series. Some episodes are a lot better than others.However, some criticisms:1. After going through most of the series, I got really sick of the same neighborhood used by the film crew. Come on -- mix it up a little.2. You don't need to watch many of the episodes to realize there's a theme in place. WTF --Newly divorced parent + 13 year old girl going through puberty = haunted house. Watch this show to know the true source of poltergeists!3. A lot of the episodes reference photos and recordings taken of the ghosts. If those exist, why doesn't the show actually show the original photos and let us hear the recordings? That would be extra cool. Why leave those out? I know they actually show some photos now, but they don't seem to be the originals."
5,The Haunting - exciting,The Haunting series is an interesting take on hauntings by ghosts trapped between life and where they need to go. The families that they affect are surprised by what they encounter. Do they survive their encounters? How are they affected? You just gotta watch the shows to find out!
3,The problem with this cd is UNIVERSAL RECORDS.,"8 SONGS???!! That's it. #1 ""Ella lo sabe"" is good and #8 ""El Remedio"" is GREAT. The rest is ""okay"". Where's the rest of the music?"
2,Un Michael Stuart con miedo........,"Este disco marca el regreso de Michael despues de 4 años de ausencia y nos deja mas de lo mismo, un Michael sin evolucion pero para ser honesto con unos buenos arreglos musicale. Michael no quiero ser adivino pero si tu no promocionas este disco como se debe, creo que vas al fracaso y seria una lastima para un buen artista. Estoy seguro que Universal no le hara otro disco."
4,America Through French Eyes,"""America Day by Day"" is a look at the experiences of Simone de Beauvoir, a French existentialist, as she traveled through the United States in the Spring of 1947. Beauvoir chronicles her experiences in journal form, and the reader is able to gauge her reactions to different regions and factions of American life first hand. We witness her awe at all the conveniences in a hotel lobby, and her disdain for the situation with blacks in the South prior to the Civil Rights movement, among other things. Beauvoir primarily mixes and mingles with intellectuals and journalists, but she also has meaningful interactions with college students and African Americans. Through this all, we see Beauvoir's positive and negative views of the United States--both the goodness in the nature of the American people and the ways in which American freedom and democracy is restricted by the aristocratic nature of society are featured."
3,"Does the job, but over priced, takes some effort","I paid almost $7 for it. I was expecting something more durable. It's just a cheap washer that is 1/2"" inside and 5/8"" outside diameter. It is a single use item. It had to be hammered into the blade then it barely fit over the spindle and had to be tapped into place with a hammer to get it to fit flush on the saw. I was hoping for something easier to use. I would not mind if it was a pack of ten for the price but I can not justify the price I paid. The only reason I do give it 3 stars is because I have not found a better one yet otherwise it would have been worse."
5,Great bushing for saw blades,"The bushing was a snug fit for the Freud saw blade I purchased for my 1/2"" arbor table saw. I don't have to worry about losing the bushing when I remove the blade from the saw."
2,Outrages Shipping Charges,This was the only place i could find this item (at the time!)POoR FIT!I was Charged an outrageous price for the shipping of these two items! (Charged twice for shipping the two items! ) They weighed less than a Dime!Could have mailed in an envelope!!I SERIOUSLY DOUBT THAT I WILL EVER USE AMAZON AGAIN !!!!!!!!!!!
3,GOOD BUT OILY,"THIS STUFF IS PRETTY GOOD EXCEPT YOU HAD BETTER FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS WHEN IT SAYS SMALL AMOUNT. I USED ABOUT THE SIZE OF A NICKEL AND SPREAD THROUGHOUT MY HAIR AS INSTRUCTED, ONCE WHILE WET AND THEN AGAIN WHEN DRY. WORKED GREAT WHEN WET AND MADE MY HAIR FEEL HEALTHY, BUT WHEN I USED IT WHEN MY HAIR WAS DRY IT GOT INCREDIBLY OILY AND WHAT'S WORSE, IT STAYED LIKE THAT ALL DAY LONG! I WORE A BEANIE TO TRY TO MAKE IT DRY QUICKER, STUCK MY HEAD OUT THE WINDOW WHILE DRIVING, ANYTHING I COULD DO TO GET MY HAIR TO LOOK DRY AND NATURAL. SO I GAVE IT TO SOMEBODY, IT WAS GOOD TO MAKE YOUR HAIR HEALTHY BUT CERTAINLY NOT WORTH $25."
2,An over-priced non-miracle product,"This is not a must-have product. It weighed my hair down and made it greasy, though I didn't use more than a dime's worth. My mother had the same experience. We both have thick, dyed-blonde hair. It didn't noticeably improve the shine of my hair, didn't aid in styling it, and did not enhance the finished look of my hair. I tried using it on both wet and dry hair- always had the same experience. My mother liked the fragrance, which is kind of citrus-y, but I'm not wild about it. Eufora-brand products are better and more effective, IMHO."
1,Made my hair brittle!,"After reading all the rave reviews about this glossing cream from various sites, I decided to visit my local Sephora store and try it out yesterday. Unfortunately, this cream did not work with my relaxed shoulder length hair. It gave a brilliant shine, however, at the same time, any left over product on my hands was disgustingly oily! Also, my hair felt brittle after applying this product! Except for my hair ends, the rest of my hair was relatively soft and smooth, and this product made my hair feel brittle! Not impressed. In fact, it seems when most people like a product, it doesn't work with my hair. In my opinion, this product is even worse than Biosilk Silk Therapy which I hate! (It's also very greasy but at least my hair didn't feel brittle)."
4,Really nice,I love this stuff. It makes my hair so soft and sleek. Just don't use too much or your hair might look a little greasy.
2,Not so great for my hair type,"I have course, medium-thick hair, that is not straight, and not curly-- I'd call it slightly wavy. It is colored to hide gray, but not super dry. I'd describe it as a bit porous because it does frizz in humidity. Well- this product made my hair take forever to blow dry, and it left it soft, but not ""good soft."" Rather, it left my hair, well, fluffy and full. It did not leave my hair shiny, but, instead, left it looking a bit dull. The one good point about it was that it does seem to moisturize your hair. But, I'd rather leave that to my conditioner. Won't even finish the tube, I think."
1,THE OLD FORMULA WORKS!! THIS ONE DOES NOT!!!,"The old formula worked. This one doesn't. This formula made my hair dry and puffy!!! I am so upset b/c it is puffing out my hair and it costs soooo much... this ""new improved"" formula must be cheaper... it doesn't work.... total disappointment!!! Fredric, I want my Money back!!!"
5,Just a Pea Size Amount,"I got a free sample tube of this stuff and I love it. I use it on towel dried hair before I style my hair. I think one of the most important things to know about this product is to use the pea size amount recommended; using anymore can leave your hair looking oily, especially at the roots. It's hard to imagine that such a small amount can do such an awesome job but it does. I have found that using Fekkai products in conjunction with one another seems to help them all work better together."
2,Oily,"The overwhelming number of customer reviews for this product was positive, which led to my confidence purchase.I, however, personally find this product to be a little too oily. I have naturally wavy, fine, dry hair that needs to be straightened everyday.When I put this product on (following exactly what the instructions said), I found my hair somewhat shiny in appearance. However, the product also kept the strands of my hair in somewhat of a chunky fashion, and my hair wasn't blowing naturally in the wind. And every time I touched my hair throughout the day, there was the unpleasant oily feeling lingering on my fingers that I had to wash off. The next day when I started washing my hair, I noticed that one round of shampooing was far from enough to get all the product out of my hair."
4,Smooth away those flyaways,"Use just the right amount and this works fabulous. It says to use a pea size, but that is too much for my hair which has a lot of natural oils. If I use a pea size or more my hair looks greasy. On the bright side, this lasts all day through intense heat."
2,A Scientist to Remember,"The book was filled with many pages of interesting info that I found informative and enjoyable to read as a literature teacher. It was composed with inciteful quotes that can influence the reader. Finally, I would advise anyone interested in reading about a great man like this one should go out and buy this book"
4,Excellent Reference Book,"When I was a beginning herb user, I found her Complete Medicinal Herbal enormously helpful. This book is an expansion of that one with the same information plus a great deal more. I recommend it highly to anyone who is not familiar with the world of herb healing. The pictures are excellent and the information comprehensive (warnings for excess use, etc, are very good). I have other books about herbs, but this is the easiest to understand and utilize."
4,A great mix of fun stories,"I loved this work from Obejas. It was such a fast read that I read it again. If you look beyond the surface, you see a world that many will relate to in their own lives...maybe not in whole, but at least partially."
5,Love it!,My husband bought this Hot Wheel Impala for his collection of of toy cars. He loves it and takes care of his rare finds such as this.
5,Works wonderfully with E-PL2!,The lens works very well with my Olympus E-PL2 via MMF-2 adapter. AF is fast enough in sufficient light and slightly slower in low light but still absolutely usable with no need to resort to MF. The lens is most suitable for still portraits. The lens + MMF-2 adapter is 340g whcih is lighter than the camera body (364g) so the ergonomics are just fine. It's not good for video because of the slower AF and noisy motor. Being a macro lens it is more suitable for flowers than insects (only 1:2 magnification). Therefore it works best for portraits because it produces incredibly creamy bokeh. I use it permanently at f2 even in bright sun (with ND filter).
4,Must have lens for four thirds,"Fantastic must have lens for any four thirds camera, especially Olympus. I mainly use as portrait lens, but also excellent for macro. I wish Olympus made a similar fast prime that was 25mm or wider. Optics and build quality are both excellent."
1,MSDE,"The installation of the CD, provided with the book, can cause untold problems. Murach does not give any warning that these problems can occur. When I contacted them by email a few times they had still refused to respond. It is quite literally a case of ""take the money and run"".Even accessing online technical sites proves a challenge to solving it!Do not buy books from this company unless you are willing to take the risk that you won't actually be able to use it."
2,BE AWARE OF WHAT YOU ARE GETTING,"I was very disappointed with the book. Apparently it's part of a series and has a cookie cutter feel. After the part about Dachshunds (maybe 1/2), the rest is generic dog information. I really wanted more about the topic in the title. The title is a bit deceiving - so don't expect too much."
5,A Must Have Book,"This is one of the best I have read. Dealing with everything you need to know, from getting prepared to an emergency. With every suggestion, there is an answer, and some of her personal experiences. A well written book for all dachshund owners, or visa-versa."
3,Why don't they release this on DVD?,"Why the F*** won't they just release this show on DVD? Spike put that crappy striperella show on DVD, and that show is worthless. I'm sure it didn't sell and now they have cold feet about putting Gary the Rat on DVD. PUT THIS SHOW ON DVD! Screw this Video on Demand garbage."
4,"good instrument, but sent broken","When this banjo arrived I had one of my music professors help me set it up and check it out. He said that it was a good quality instrument from a standard brand, but the one that I was sent had a cracked neck, making it unplayable. Understand that this is not a defect of the product itself but a mistake from the company, but do make sure to check out the instrument well before keeping it, making sure that there are no cracks in the fragile wood."
2,Oscar Schmidt Banjo,"I bought this instrument because I was helping a friend to learn the banjo. It looked great and didn't sound too bad until I started working my way around the neck and found it way too loose. The slightest pressure at about the 3rd fret pulled the strings because the neck was moving. I couldn't keep it in tune and pitch is important. Also, once taking the back off, discovered an unsettling bow in the truss rod under the head. The thumb screws didn't seat the resonator back on correctly and 2 were completely stripped. Bad construction, the manufacturer or assembler ""made it fit."" I sent it back. Save a few bucks and buy a basic Deering and you are way better off. This one really was impossible to keep on pitch and it was unplayable."
4,Great value for the money!,"We purchased this banjo from Amazon 10 months ago for our 11 year old son who was begging us to take banjo lessons. We figured it would just be a passing thing for him and purchased the least expensive instrument we could find. When it arrived, I immediately saw the ""Made in China"" label and nearly packed it up and shipped it back. But, my son's instructor said that it was a great instrument for beginners. So far, he was right. For the past 10 months, it has held up to an 11/12 year old boy's abuse, not fallen apart and still holds its tune. My son practices a minimum of twice a day for at least 1/2 hour each time. He has had zero problems with it. It looks good, is well made and should last him quite a while. There is a noticable difference in tone when compared to the instructor's $4,000 banjo, so it is by no means a professional-grade instrument. But, we didn't pay for a professional instrument either. An excellent value for the money."
5,Let's play the banjo!,"I got this banjo for Christmas and I can't stop playing it. If you're considering learning banjo, do it. I've learned a little guitar and harmonica, but I never had half the fun that I have with the banjo. I'm a beginner, but the banjo itself seems excellent. Solid, good sound, and very nice-looking. Out of the box I had to set the bridge (which had a small crack in it; my only complaint) and tighten the head a bit. If you're new to music, you need to get an electric tuner to tune the banjo and set the bridge in exactly the right spot."
2,"""In Stock"" isn't necessarily true.","I ordered one of these because I was looking for an inexpensive banjo to learn on. Because of the great reviews and the price, I jumped on this one, which was being sold by Austin Bazaar. The order was supposed to arrive within 10 days or so. However, after 8 days my order still said ""Shipping Soon"". I contacted the seller and was told that the banjo was actually out of stock and would not be arriving until 2-3 MONTHS later. As a result I cancelled the order (there were no problems with the seller in doing this).So if you order one of these be warned... just because the ad says the banjo is ""in stock"" doesn't mean it really is.P.S. I ordered a Mastercraft Player Deluxe the next day instead... the reviews are just as good, and it was shipped the day after I placed the order."
4,Inspring reference for reenactors,"Embleton's book provides a surprising amount of densely informative text, accompanied by full color photographs of good-quality reenactment kits. The periods featured include the 10th through 15th centuries, though the 15th century gets the greatest amount of coverage. Interestingly, women (or at least the types of women likely to accompany a period army) are also included and receive a surprising amount of coverage also. I recommend this little gem to any 14th-15th century European reenactor, as well as to military and costume scholars of the medieval period."
4,"A must for every professional bookshelf, but dated","I have felt for years that this is probably the best single reference on behavioural ecology up through 1975 & actively seek out used copies to give my students, so it is nice to see a relatively cheap re-print. SOCIOBIOLOGY has a massive Lit. Cited (up to date of original publication) and contains all the really useful bits of Wilson & Bossert's very useful PRIMER OF POPULATION BIOLOGY. It also has some lovely examples of pioneering studies in behavioural ecology that in some cases have been taken to very exciting ""next levels"" over the past quarter century & in other cases still lie fallow. Wilson's style is readable and I still feel that this book makes a good foundation block for a personal library, but it is essential that one gets more recent stuff as well, including both the critics and the elaborators. This is the beginning only."
2,Beware--looks nothing like photo,"I ordered this rug in two sizes for an entryway and hall runner. In the photo, it appeared to have a neutral tan background with small pebble-like circles on top. I received the rugs today and I'm so disappointed. The circles that I thought would be pebble sized are actually the size of my hand--they're 4 or 5 inches in diameter. They have odd borders around them that change color, so one circle might have 2 or three colors in the border. The worst part for me, though, is that the background color is a muddy mess. It appears pink, copper, purple and brown all together. On the plus side, the rug is soft and cozy. It feels pretty well made for the price. I wish it looked like the photo, because now I'm going to be hauling those things down to UPS for a hefty return shipping fee tomorrow."
5,The '50s As They Really Were,"Wow! I knew that there had to be more to the late fifties/early 60's than history suggests. This book sheds some light on what really went on. It wasn't all sugar and spice, that's for sure. Kudo's not only to the author, but to the artists that were interviewed. The reader will come away with newfound respect for each of them. Fabian, especially, who has been much-maligned, has a fascinating story to tell. Until he decides to write his own book, this is must reading for fans of popular culture. OUtstanding from beginning to end!"
1,BIG TIME BORING!,"The author says she was a great fan of her parents music, mostly teeny bopper early '60's stuff and she tries to draw some magnificent relationship between the music of that time and her own desire for a fairy tale existence.If you don't fall asleep reading this trite, i'll buy you a nickel coke.Gino"
1,save your money!,"Three of Ms. Schoemer's chapters are titles ""Me"". ""Me Again"" and ""More Me.""The bulk of Ms. Schoemer's text is a ""who cares"" dialogue about her iffy relationship with her parents...especially her mother. It's much more about ""Me"" than it is about the 50's singers....and I was bored to death. Save your money!"
5,Life is Tremendous and this book helped me discover why!,"The authors wit and charm helped me understand the true purpose of life. All of us need a little help some time and this book is just the ticket. The authors blend of wit, charm and humor made this book a please to read.I strongly recommend this book for adults and young adult. This is the type of book that I would like my children to use as a model for their life. This book is ""Tremendous!"
5,Like the title says. . .,LIFE IS TREMENDOUS. Jones gives example after example of why life really is tremendous. This little gem is worth reading on a regular basis.
5,El Ultimo Judio - Magnifica Obra de Noah Gordon,"El autor logra capturar la atencion del lector y es dificil dejar de leer esta novela. El autor revela la aventura de este joven judio durante la España del 1500. Tiene suspenso, amor, y atencion al detalle en una narrativa facil de leer. El que ha viajado a, o vive en España, apreciara esta obra de marco historico. (Si les gusto The Name of the Rose, les gustara esta)."
5,Un repaso de historia,"Esta novela más que la historia de Yonah Toledano y su familia, es la historia de miles de familias judias y musulmanas que tras la conquista de Granada por los Reyes Católicos se vieron forzados a abandonar sus casas y propiedades por su fe o abjurar de ellas y convertirse al catolicismo. Muy de manifiesto se ve la mano de la Santa Inquisición que tomó parte activa en esa historica expulsión tan nefasta para la España de aquel entonces y la reacción de los ciudadanos que igual delataban a los conversos y herejes como que los protegían y escondían a sabiendas de las consecuencias que el delito acarreaba. Muy buena las descripciones que el autor hace de esa España del siglo XVI, sus costumbres, formas de vida y pensamientos."
4,Lo recomiendo mucho...,"Quedé muy contenta con la narración de la historia, la investigación que ha hecho el autor es como en todos sus libros, prolijo.Lo recomiendo...."
5,A Warm Visual Embrace of Baltimore's Little Italy,"This lovingly crafted book Rita and Perrin Frenchtraces the work of Rita's brother Tony DeSales.The prints are warm,evocative and touch the spirit ofplace, They show artist and scene as one; his trying tomake you observe the vision of Baltimore that he had embraced.Many are hauntingly beautiful renderings and show a warm remembrance of his vision. You will see many nuancesof place and look again at places found in this wonderfullycrafted editon."
5,Priceless for those who love Baltimore,"This book is a unique combination of biography, city-history, and insight into the feelings and production of a gifted, self-taught artist. Tony DeSales overcame limitations of means and circumstance to bear witness to the city and neighborhood he loved.The authors of this book, in turn, do justice to the artist's life and deep-felt monochrome and color sketches. Writing, production, and reproduction of the artwork are all first-rate.This book is a bargain at its price, and is priceless for those who share Tony DeSales' love for Baltimore."
2,Buy Quantum Memory by Dominique Obrien instead.,"This product does not go in depth with what you need to learn. There are some good starting points, and you will learn from it, but as my title says, buy Quantum Memory instead. It is much more detailed and teaches a lot more. I bought this one first, then I bought Quantum Memory."

1,"Giga Memory: Kevin Trudeau is an Uneducated, Convicted Felon!","Trudeau knows more about bending over to pick up the soap in a federal prison shower, than he does about natural cures!Try reading my informative books, available now on Amazon."
4,Four Elements,"The Book of Fours is an interesting concept for a story, but the way it is written is a bit complex and confusing. I found myself having to flip back quite a bit to remind myself of who certain characters were and what the new chapters were referring to.I liked the introduction of India as the Slayer who preceded Buffy. She reminded me a bit of the season five version of Buffy in her willingness to sacrifice herself for someone she loved. I also liked the exploration of the four elements and how they related to each Slayer.One thing that I had a problem with was that Buffy and Faith seemed to be lacking their healing time. The book referred to Faith as needing stitches for an injury that she received, which seemed odd since even when the Slayers have serious injuries (except when Faith was in a coma on the show), it rarely takes them more than a day to recover. Being unable to recover within a day from a cut seemed unusual to me."
1,Terrible,"I have read almost all the BtVS books in the series and this one is by far the most dull and uninspiring one I have ever had to sit through. I am only half way thru and there are so many charcaters to keep track of it's almost impossible.A ex Jamacian Watcher's insane wannabe lover who turns zombie/ancient dark goddess. Some pool in the middle of nowhere who spits out weapons, Xanders nephew etc etc. And Willow did not lose all her hair. How did it grow back so quikly then?This book is confusing and boring and doesn't hold true to the characters on the show.Too many unknown characters and not enough Buffy characters."
1,Very Disappointing,"Having recently devoured the Sons of Entropy triology, I found Nancy Holder's latest book very disappointing. The story is muddled and confusing.I have a modest interest in the earlier slayers but almost no interest in their watchers. Trying to figure out what is going on through flashbacks describing the point of view of several evil characters was annoying at best.I would rather read about the characters I care about: Buffy, Giles, Willow, etc. I read the books for the stories how friends deal with extreme circumstances while trying to grow up at the same time."
4,The Never-Ending Struggle Against Evil,"This novel could be considered challenging for those unfamiliar with earlier 'Buffy' novels such as ""Ghost Roads""; and most 'Buffy' novel readers will be unfamiliar with the flow (the random jumps from centuries to present times). This non-young adult novel is rich with intricate character details and history. The novel doesn't pander to casual readers and it doesn't forget its core fan base. Highlights: Faith's well-rounded characterization (Why didn't Buffy offer Faith her house to stay in?), Willow's and Buffy's friendship, a non-annoying Cordelia, Saint Xander and that spunky warrior Buffy. Things to overlook; Boston action information, The Master teasers and organization. This novel is not for weak readers. Buy it."
4,Buffy The Vampire Slayer,"For any of you who are big buffy fans like myself. Get this book. Awesome Awesome Awesome. I wish they never canceled the show. Stupidest thing ever done. But as long as they keep making book, i will continue to read them and contine to a be fan. Keep em coming."
1,"""Dry as the Sahara""","This book was entirely boring and in no way a good read. I own it but I can never get myself to read more than a few pages of it in one sitting. It's so dry that I cannot get into it. I do, recommend though, you read ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer: Blood and Fog""! It's amazing. Good Readings to everyone!"
2,Not that good.,"Most people who decide to read this book will be avid BTV fans, like myself. Thus, so much backstory is just redundant and useless. The storyline, though creative at elementary stages, is not very well developed. The writing isn't that well done, either. The characters aren't true to their personas in the television series. Their emotions and the way they talk are very uncharacteristic of the original characters. Like one said before, the Buffy lingo is forced. Though I think that it is a goo plot, I could have been developed way better than it has been. I don't recommend this book."
3,Interesting but not the best,"I personally agree with what others have said about this book. It has alot of information. At some points you could say too much. I would like to see more written about faith and India and about sluyers in general. Also to find out what happened to willow as the book ended without telling us.Overall it was good, but lacked things at certain points."
4,Quite enjoyable,"In contrast to some of the earlier reviews posted, I had no trouble following the storylines of this book. It's nonlinear, but nonetheless compelling and interesting. The characters are true to the series, and there were more than a few surprises that worked without violating internal consistancy. While I haven't read all that many Buffy books, I'm a big fan of the show and thought this was as good as many of the episodes, and better than quite a few."
3,Enjoyable,"Goldman relates some funny anedotes in this book. That's mainly what it is, a bunch of anecdotes. He's ridiculously dramatic when relating his personal life, and his bleeding-heart-liberal moments are almost laughable in their (unintended) schmaltziness. And he is so opinionated about films, that, if you've seen the ones he's talking about, may scratch your head about the certaintly of his wrong-headed opinions. Despite those flaws, the book is very entertaining. And it inspired me to rent the movie he voted for the Cannes jury prize award (I won't say which one and give the surprise away), which, indeed, is a great film."
4,Entertaining,"I loved this book. It has been quite a wait for the next Repairman Jack novel to arrive. I remember when I first read the the Tomb I was amazed and have been anticipating a new chapter ever since. This book did not dissapoint. My favorite chapter without giving to much away was Jack's booby trapped hideout and the suprises that it held in store for the thugs. I only had two minor gripes. I wish there was more of a supernatural element to the story like in the Tomb but that is just a personal preferance, also the relationship between Alicia and the cop never really seemed to have a purpose, it was all set up and had your interest but then it just dissapeared. Anyway read the book you will be entertained."
3,"Good product, but you don't exactly as pictured","It's a very nice tasting cinnamon, but it doesn't get 5 stars because the shipping costs was too expensive and it did not come as pictured. It came in a different plastic bag with no label which made me wonder why the product doesn't match the picture."
5,"great novel, a must read!","Kushkel's first novel, Lotto Trouble, is definitely worth a read. It is exciting, action packed, and has a slew of memorable and great characters! Definitely buy this book! Some people are loath to give a chance to an unknown author but give this book a chance, and i promise it will be one gamble that will definitely pay off!"
5,Loved this page turner,A great first book.Held my interest all the way.Couldn't wait to see what happened next.Highly recommend it.Will be looking for Mr.Kushel's next book.
3,Good story,"Though the story line was good, I was disappointed in the acting in the first 2/3 of the movie. I've seen Matt Dallas in a show where his acting seemed natural, believable but it seemed forced in this movie until the last 1/3. The other adult actors were really bad in the first 2/3 of the movie though Alison Haislip's acting was pretty good throughout. I don't know what happened but it all seemed to come together in the last part of the movie and I could see that the actors were feeling their parts, finaly!"
5,The Indian a story of redemption!,The Indian is a story of redemtion and the fact that its never to late to make a change to your life. I think this is an excellent film to watch if you want to feel a good emotional response.
5,A perfect gift,This is a second Oscar Schmidt OU5 Concert ukulele I am giving as a gift. It is beautiful and sounds great. One string was buzzing on the first ukulele but the buzzing went away after a while; the second one seems to have no problems at all.I bought it together with Kala Concert Ukulele Gig Bag and it fits perfectly.
5,"Best uke in the midrange, great price.","I am an avid ukulele player and this uke is one of my favorites. I own a Kala solid spruce uke and it cost 200 dollars more than this did.The intonation and the projection on this uke matches my style in playing, which is soft and smooth. Even though this is not a solid woodinstrument it plays like one. Very nicely made and the design on the woodwork is flattering to say the least. Love this ukulele and recommendsit to beginners and professionals alike. You'll never need another one unless you want a bigger ukulele.Note: I also have a Makala Soprano, which is very low end. And a Kala Solid Spruce Tenor. And The OU5 is the one i use the most. I love its sound."
4,Worth the price,I've owned the Concert Koa for about 6 months & am quite happy with my choice. The construction and finish are fantastic. Tone is great even though I've read reviews saying that a laminate's sound isn't as good as a solid wood ukulele. Recently I started a group ukulele class and I can truthfully state that mine sounds better than some of the more expensive ones in the class. An excellent buy for $120.
3,good sound not good set up,"The uke is a good value. Pretty good sound for a reasonable price. Well built and attractive workmanship. There were two buzzing strings that would have needed to have work done. Since there is no place to have that work done around my town, I had to send this one back."
1,Extremely misleading,"Just a warning. If you think you are going to get a Washburn ukulele from Amazon, you will not. As in my case, you will recieve an OSCAR SCHMIDT ukulele by Washburn. a nice ukulele but you could get it for only $99. I got very little empathy when I voiced the issue with Amazon directly. Maybe I should have caught on when there was no picture available for this item.MW"
4,Good product for a cheap money!,"A very good roduct for a cheap money! This is a very good ukulele for starters and also more advanced players.I will recomend also to buy the Ukulele tuner when purchasing a uke, itvhas a tendensy to get out of tune especially when itvis new. The $19 it cost for a tuner is worthwhile."
3,"Nice looking, decently made","This is a beautiful looking instrument with very decent, not great sound. It is one of the mid-ranged priced uke brands, well-built for the price. It is similar in price and preferred brand, KALA which I think has a bigger sound. But, if you're looking for a good uke, with standard concert-size sound, this is a good uke."
5,Great Little Instrument,"Bottom line, this is a cool UKE. I've been a musician 40+ years and this little instrument has me smiling! Stays in tune and sounds great after replacing the stock strings. If I was buying one again, I would be sure to put fresh strings on first thing.Enjoy!!!!!!"
3,Average Entry in Bibliotherapy Canon,"Even though kids at school make fun of him for having two moms, Nick still manages to have a pretty happy childhood. When he turns 14, Erin and Jo decide to split up. Erin, Nick's birthmother, insists on sole custody of her son, despite the feelings of both Nick and her now ex-partner, a recovering alcoholic, that Jo is responsible enough to care for him. Things escalate when Erin invites her new girlfriend, Kerri, to move in with them. Nick struggles with angst, depression, and rage as the tug-of-war battle ensues. In terms of plot, this is an average entry in the literary canon of bibliotherapy. The ending is a bit rushed and too easily resolved, but it may, in any case, be therapeutic for teens suffering from similar issues. Recommended for Ages 15-Up."
2,pretty but doesn't last,I was so excited when i got it it looked great but with in a couple of days the coating started coming off. Then the two plastic peices that hold the top cover on broke. I was very disstaisfied with this product.
3,Spiru-tein Powder,"I tried this product for adding nutrients to my day. I have trouble swallowing so I tried this product. It has tiny marshmallows in it. I tried to mix it by hand (suggested mixing method,) but it it too time consuming and difficult. So then I tried the shake blender. Here are my results:A disgustingly sweet mix with now crushed Marshmallow powder. This powder (resulting from blender), got stuck in my throat and made me choke. Still I am using it up cause at this price I can't afford to waste it.I may try another flavor although the sweetness thing is usually a deal breaker."
4,A great book on a complex subject,"I have to say that i was quite impressed by the content of this book. I started with David Chappell's book on COM and ActiveX and this took me a bit deeper into this somewhat complex subject. I would recommend it to anyone. One caveat - you must at least understand the basics of C++ to get any serious value from it as this is the authors language of choice. Nice book, though"
3,"Decent book, could use more real world examples","Aside from a bad sense of humor, this book does provide some good information. It has been very helpful in introducing the concepts of COM. The author could have explained things more clearly by using real world examples as opposed to the IY and IZ examples. I would recommend this book for people familiar with C++ and are wanting to learn COM."
5,Great book,"This book is very easy to follow. I've heard that COM is a very hard subject to learn, however, this book illustrates COM in a very understandable manner. I would recommand it to anyone who are familiar with C++. But if you are a beginner c++ programmer, I don't think you will be able to understand very well. all in all, great book with good details."
5,An excellent introduction to COM.,"COM is an incredbily complex technology, so difficult to comprehend that its concepts are only understood by a relative few. This book does everything possible to simplify and explain COM, step by step. While this book *may* not give you that real-world insight you might have hoped for, it gives you that ever-so-necessary first step. And in COM, the first step is EVERYTHING. Thank goodness this book exists, I have yet to find any book so well suited for introducing a programmer to COM."
3,For C++ programmers only,"A warning (which, in due fairness is on the cover of the book): This book is written for C++ programmers only. Although the COM interface is language-independant, one must know C++ code and nomenclature thoroughly to be able to navigate the examples and text. The author's contempt of other programming languages, particlularly Visual Basic, comes through fairly clearly when they are discussed (really only one chapter). If you want a book that shows how to implement low-level COM from another language and don't know C++, you may want to look elsewhere."
5,Great for understanding what COM is.,This book is great for COM beginners. At last I understand what COM is and what it's good for. The stuff I learnt from this book has already greatly improved my own projects and allowed others to use my components.
4,This is THE book for understanding COM conscepts,"Before this I read ""OLE Controls Inside Out"" and tried to read ""Inside OLE"". Although I understood the words, I never really GOT it. This book connected, and I am now using ATL to write COM objects. I don't really want to go back to non-COM programming. Buy this book!"
4,Great Intro - But Ends Too Soon,"This is an excellent book to get of the ground with learning the basics of COM. If you work through the examples, you will know the foundation of COM programming. Two things disappointed me. One, the descriptions of his examples became less comprehensive toward the last chpaters, making it harder to grasp. Given the excellent beginning sample, I was disappointed. The thrading chapter in particular left me hanging a bit. Second, I would have liked to have seen a chapter on implementing a existing COM object, such as need for shell programming for example. Otherwise, a good book."
5,Excellent C++ Level Introduction to the COM Basics,"COM is rich in good books. It has the heavenly three (D. Chappel, D. Box, K. Brockschmidt) and now this one. It is a good alternative to Don Boxes (Mr. COM) masterpiece. It clearly explains the foundations on a C++ level and no more. You will have to turn to Brockschmidt for that. I strongly recommand this book and wish more other subjects would have books on comparable quality."
3,Chapter 10 is the worst,"The author stuffs everything in a dir and provides readers a make file without much comments, which makes readers stay inside COM but do not know where to go!"
5,Excellent book on COM fundamentals,This is an excellent book for those who want to understand how COM works. The book is written in logical order with plenty of examples and in good humor. I would recomend this book to anyone who wants to grasp COM fundamentals and don't yawn while at it.
3,Give you some good foundation of writing COM in C++,"This book presents what COM is, gives good basic COM programming from a C++ coding perspective. If you don't know C++, do not buy the book. It is not a practical book. It just takes too much time to write COM this way. After you know the basic of COM, you will need other book(s) to do the actual COM development...and then this Inside COM probably stays inside the shelf forever. And some years later, you probably think of this book as the COM appreciation book.For the amount of information it provides, this book is over price."
5,Good luck finding a better intro book,"This book is about as good as they come. Dale Rogerson should be commended. I've been in this field longer than most and can safely say this is one of the best intro books I've ever read. Clear, concise and straight to the point. No bloated examples that run for 200 pages. Just tiny and very simple snippets of code demonstrating the precise mechanics of how to develop a COM object from scratch. Target audience is C/C++ developers with a Microsoft compiler background though others will benefit as well. Don't listen to the naysayers on this one. This book is terrific."
5,"Great description of how COM works, and why","This book starts out with a simple C++ class called by some other code, and works to encapsulate it into a component, basically implementing COM from scratch. This really lets you understand how it works and why. It's well written and does a good job describing all the details.As others have mentioned, this is not a book about ActiveX, OLE, ATL, or any of that, and it doesn't pretend to be. This book just describes COM, the basis for those technologies. If you want to really understand what's going on with COM, I highly recommend this book."
3,Be Warned,"1) Know C++ 2) Know Visual C++ 3) Spend Time Reading and Re-reading 4) Prepare for mistakes in the bookThis book is decent until half way. Then, the mistakes are many and gets worse as it goes. The worst part is that the examples use makefiles that you can't understand. This is okay until the examples get more complex and then the author stops explaining the projects. The author should include .dsp files, but doesn't. At least, he should explain the projects so I have a chance at building the examples later in the book. My favorite quote is on page 211 ""First, we'll use C++ classes to make using COM components more like using C++ classes."" My second favorite quote is on page 287 ""The first three (parameters) are easily explained... The third parameter holds localization information."" Dale never again mentions ""localization"", so I guess it was easy for him to explain."
5,A must read for every COM developer,"I found this book to be well written & well organized. While having read numerous COM books, it is this book that helped me pull it all together with respect to COM. While the first half of the book is a good introduction, the second half builds on that knowledge & extends our reach into reuse, containment & aggregation & so much more. I found Chapter 10 & its detailing of component registration particularly useful for the project @ hand. Moreover, with the class factory coverage, I realized that MS's COM is nothing more that OSF's DCE adapted to Windows & that COM needs to instantiate components, marshal function calls free, locally or remotely &, from there on, beyond doing more of the same, consider threading & security issues & render them in the framework as pertinent."
3,"Too many words, too little content","There are about 100 pages worth of content in the book. The rest is annoying filler, stories, and what appears to be padding to make the book fatter on the shelf. If you think spending $30 for 100 pages on COM is a good deal, buy it. Otherwise, look for something else (not Beginning ATL COM Programming, please!)"
2,"Wordy, unclear, good concepts, weak details","Gave me a good basic understanding of what COM is, but did not help me AT ALL in understanding how to use or create COM objects.1) I didn't like the wordy, conversational style. I would prefer more step-by-step procedure lists and section summaries.2) The distinction between ""using a COM object"" and ""creating a COM object"" was unclear. Rogerson kept shifting the focus between these two activities, sometimes in the same sentence.3) His sample code was incomplete, forcing you to go to the disk. I'd prefer complete in-context code samples.I think the book could have delivered more useful information in half the size. If you like verbose reference materials, this is probably a great book. For me it was not helpful."
4,"Good writing style, good detailed content, but only C++","I think this is a very good book. Although I noticed someone else complained about the authors anecdotal style, I find it helps keep my attention through what could be incredibly tedious technical details. By writing this way I think he has been able to include a great deal of detail without putting everyone to sleep, which is good, IMHO. An example (while talking about reference counting): ""It is far too easy for another programmer...to screw up the lifetimes and break the optimized reference counts.""The warning that isn't made clear enough, however, is that this is really only a C++ book. If C++ isn't the language you plan to use, I would not recommend this book (and the fine print on the back cover does say this book is for ""intermediate to advanced C++ programmers"")."
1,Terrible,"The terrible bum-rush style of this book leaves the reader dazed, confused and feeling cheated. Don't buy this book!"
1,Big disappointment,Inside OLE was a classic. This book was awful. It was an embarrassment to the Inside XXX series. I don't think this book taught me a thing.
1,Don't waste your time or money,A better book would be Essential COM by Don Box. There is too much customized code which gets in the way of understanding COM.
1,Nondelivery,The order for this item was placed in August 2005. It is now January 2006 and the item has not yet arrived.
3,Easy and entertaining,"I picked this up in the discount aisle along with a book my book club was going to read. I liked this book! I'm not usually a romance reader but this wasn't too romancey. I liked getting to know all the characters; I think the author did a good job of developing them and I liked how she kind of hopped around from one persons life to another. The chapters are short so you don't have to spend hours with it at a time unless you want to. I will read her other books for plain enjoyment and entertainment, but not necessarily literary challenge or beautiful prose."
3,Wide range of characters,"This novel is unique in the intermingling of the wide range of characters across multiple age groups. While there are many characters involved, each is independently developed and easy to to keep track of."
1,Can you believe these people?,"I feel like I owe my brain an apology for exposing it to this book....ALL the characters are reprehensible--manipulative, dishonest, judgmental, incapable of appropriate communications, and that's when they are not being deliberately cruel to each other or so thick they cannot recognize they are being manipulated. Do yourself a favor--skip this one, and pick up a Marian Keyes novel."
5,It's a Littmann. What else do you need to know?,This is a fab stethescope. There isn't much more to say about the Littmann other than I am just as pleased with my pediatric one as I was with my adult classic II. The sound is clear as a bell! (pun intended)
4,Sleek and Stylish,It gives a professional look with its sleek and stylish design.Feels light and looks great.
5,Meggy's Review of Mi Reflejo,I just got the CD today! I believe it is Christina's best work yet! Can't wait for her Christmas album! :)
3,es que falta la pasión,"Christina really has a great voice. But while listenning to this disc, I missed the passion in her voice. I don't know why, but I really have the impression that she didn't know what she was singing when she recorded that disc. The clearest indication of this fact is that she had somebody who translated the English texts. Only the few songs which were translated sound quite well, but the rest seems to be written while being under great pression of time. Finally must be admited that her American accent is really nice, and the Spanish lyrics can be understood very well ."
5,Christina's on a roll!!,"Christina showed the world what great vocal talent she has on her debuet album and made two singles from it great remixes and here she is again with an album so great that you just can't stop pushing the repeate button over and over and over. We all knew she could sing brilliantly in English but wow this spanish album it great! It has amazing vocals and great tunes!! She loaded this album with sizzaling salsa numbers to beautiful balads. This album was so much more than i excpected. I mean i knew it would be great, but this is terrific!!! This album has already debuded at number 1 on the latin top 50 billboard charts and 27 on the billboards top 200!! This is a MUST for ALL Christina fans wiether or not you speak English or Spanish!!"
4,It's preety good... sort of,"I never liked Christina until I saw that she sang in spanish. I bought this CD and some songs sucked, but most of them were OK. Falsas Esperanzas is the only song that sounds like it's not a ballad. The rest are pretty much boring but it preety much OK."
5,EDITION DELUXE.........GREATS SONGS AND GREATS REMIXES,"QUE EXCELENTE ALBUM ESTA EDICION DE MI REFLEJO HACE DE ESTE EN VERDAD UN ALBUM DE SUPERVENTAS LATINO, CHRISTINA ES UNA ARTISTA MUY COMPLETA APARTE DE SER BELLA TIENE UNA EXCELENTE VOZ. LOS REMIXES SON MUY BUENOS Y COMPLETA EL DISCO CON EL INSTRUMENTAL DE VEN CONMIGO."
1,Boring,"I bought this cd with high expectations...but I was let down. This cd is very boring and Christina Aguilera should have left the spanish alone. None of the songs are entertaining, the only one I liked was Una Mujer....only because it is very funny to listen to."
5,Too beautiful for words,"I bought this album by force of habit, being a dedicated Christina fan, though I didn't expect to be wowed any more than I already had been by her vocals. But her voice has grown and matured, which, a year ago, was amazingly mature for an 18 year old, is now...well, see the title of my review for a better description. Falsas Esperanzas (False Hopes) is, in my opinion, the best track on the disc. Contigo En La Distancia (With You In The Future) a certainly awe-inspiring bolero, aside, of course. Her voice is amazing and beautiful, and while Britney's rinsing, lathering, and repeating her monotonous pop music formula, Christina is growing into what will surely be a vocal legend. Good luck to her, and may God continue to bless her with good fortune and success. Para ti, Christina!"
5,Christina is the best!,"Even though I don't understand Spanish, but I bought this album to support Christina! She has a very strong voice and good singing skills. I love singing along with her CD because I have a deep voice like Christina, I love the style she sings too. I hope Christina will get better soon and won't cancel the concert in October. I am looking forward to see her perform live!"
2,"Same, predictable, standard pop only in a ""latin"" package","Many of the hits on her English CD don't really sound well in Spanish. The record company should have just paid writers to make new material instead of rehashing the same old songs. This is just the same pop fluff from her previous CD offered in a new package and with a few different sounding latin artists to make it sound ""authentic"". This CD reeks of pretentiousness to me and I don't believe Christina is ""exploring"" anything about herself here, it's just an opportunity to ham it up in a new language... (would this CD have been taken as seriously if someone without a spanish last name had made it?) Besides, would she have even come out with a spanish CD if it wasn't the ""in"" thing to do right now? I just hope she comes out with an Irish CD soon to honor her mother's heritage (U know, the person who actually CARED about Christina)."
1,I DON'T UNDERSTAND!!!!!!!,"I DON'T SPEAK SPANISH, SO THERE WAS NO REASON FOR ME TO GET THIS CD.............BUT FOR SOME RESON I GOT IT!!!!!!!!!IT IS VERY FRUSTRATING TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT SHE IS SAYING!!!!IT ALL SOUNDS LIKE A BUNCH OF SLOP.I HEARD HER CHRISTMAS CD IS GONNA BE HALF SPANISH TOO WHICH IS DISSAPOINTING!!!!!I WANT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT SHE IS SAYING IN ENGLISH........ IN AN ENGLISH SPEAKING COUNTRY!!!!!!AND WHY IS SHE TOPLESS ON HER CD COVER???OH WELP.......THATS MY OUTLOOK ON THIS CD!"
2,"....Well, ..The Producers sucked...","If your thinking this album would sound like a Selena Album...your wrong, The Production and Writting skills on this album are not done well at all, Christinas voice seems to be not as clear as her last album...and that means that she has strained her voice...did you see her on the VMA's she could not even hit the high notes on the end of ''Come On Over, Baby''.And Plus the thing I dis-like on this album is that the fast songs sound like carnival music...ok shes Latin, but not Mexican...onl Mexican music sound like a carnival....So Christina if you want to make a better spanish album, get some good producers and song writters...because the ones you got...just aint cuttin it."
2,bland,"After having heard some of these songs in English, the lyrics in Spanish struck me as ludicrous. In addition, most of the CD sounds like generic run-of-the-mill Spanish-language ballads. J.Lo's first album is way better, for example, and even has more lasting value. Xtina's voice may be great, but the songs are too dull."
4,Cristina's Spanish side Shows through!,"Cristina's 2 album is good, just like her first one. With one BIG difference: It's in Spanish(Which isen't fun for us lyrics-learners!), and the songs are spanish style, too! I generally liked this album, but it was a bit complicated!"
1,Muy horrible!,"Ok, now why is Christina Aguilera making a Spanish album? Is is because she did that song ""Nobody Wants to Be Lonely"" with Ricky Martin? This album always was and always will be a big mistake. Unless you don't understand English, I don't recommend this CD for you."
1,Christina is just a FAKE RIP OFF of Samantha Fox!,"Disgusting that Jive never changes its ideas. They gave Christina Aguilera exactly the same image like the late 80s singer Samantha Fox. Even the red strands in their hair in their 2nd or for Sam's instance 3rd album.Compare the videoclips ""Naughty girls need love,too"" with Christina's new single. Also the steps in Sam Fox's 1991 videoclip for ""Hurt me! But the pants stay on"" are EXACTLY the same as in Christina's genie in a bottle steps.It's just disgusting how uninventive the firm Jive is and how they degrade their artists to be imitated by a cheap teenie version 10 years later.Also towards Christina it is not very fair to just let her be an imitation. The original rule! So let Christina have the chance to be also an original..."
5,Leaning Spanish,"I love Christina Aguilera. I bought her cd to also help myself learn spanish. Some of the songs I know in english, so hearing it in spanish helps me learn. This is a great Cd."
3,Differnt but cool!,I have this album and its really neat. It's just cool that christina is following here true roots of being latin.She sounds really great.But i would have rated higher but it kinda needed better songs i speak spanish im mexican and i think christina needs to practice alot more.
3,Decent game,"Finally after all the years it has been out, I have a machine that can run it with out locking up. Good game to have."
4,enjoyed it,"I had heard about it and many people have played it. So, I got it on sale and was glade to play it through. It was fun but not much for replay. The story was interesting enough too."
4,"easy, fast, cheap",i was dissapointed that there is no rank or ladder system with online play however the grafics and gameplay are superb
4,Good game. Not great. Fantastic technology.,"Well this game is the new benchmark for gaming rigs. So if you want to put your hardware to the test, put this game on medium settings... That's a joke, but seriously, this game is hefty on the requirements. Despite that, I was able to run it fairly well with my 256MB ATI x800s in Crossfire configuration.The game itself is really fun and supports the Microsoft Xbox Wireless Adapter really well. I played through this game with my 360 controller and never had to refer to the keyboard.Most of the game you are pretty much ripping through North Koreans, which was the fun part. Towards the end though, you start fighting these crazy mechanical aliens and it's just not as fun.Overall, it does add some new things to the way overdone FPS genre. So that's nice. It's a well-polished game, but it could use some improvements like character developments and suit upgrades and stuff like that."
2,Lots of problems,"I was extremely surprised at this games low quality. I guess it somehow became famous due to the graphics being ahead of its time a few years ago and people use it to brag about benchmarking. The guns are not very accurate at all which is extremely frustrating. I couldn't even get past the onslaught tank mission on easy-Had to use god mode. And i'm pretty damn good at most games. I could have gone back 7-8 saves and done what a guy on youtube does but I wish the game was just more fluid. I guess i should have known to conserve ammo 10 mins earlier in the mission ::eyerolls::. All of the difficulty settings are pretty much the same. Graphics are overrated and dont run well on my GTX 460 and dual core 2.9. And finally, the story line is pretty lame. Almost no cut scenes, no character development, none of that stuff. You just randomly shoot asians which normally I think is funny but this time I do not.Get Just Cause 2 instead."
4,FUN,"I LIKE THIS GAME, GOOD ENOUGH TO CHALLENGE YOU. UNFORTUNATELY IT CANNOT BE PLAYED THRU TO THE END BY MYSELF. THERE ARE PLACES WHERE YOU CANNOT GET PAST, YOU CAN'T WIN, YOU ARE JUST STUCK."
3,Tedius,"This game worked fine on my sub-par machine with minimal slowdowns, excellent graphics, and no crashes.The story is good and the characters are believable.The problem is the game play. The graphics are nice but its jungle jungle jungle. The way I have to fight enemies is cloak, run to new location, fire at a couple, cloak again, run to a new location, fire at... ad infinitum. There is no other way to defeat enemies, unless you have it on easy. As previously mentioned the AI often responds inappropriately. It gets boring fast."
4,"Great all around, except for the language","This game pack for the PC included Crysis and Crysis 2. Because of the inability to tone down the cursing in game, I dropped this one in the trash.It's one thing for adults to put up with, but quite another when there are grandkids around. The fix would have been easy enough: just add a language filter so users can turn off the cursing and swearing. Everything else in the game was adjustable - but no language filter."
1,vista schmista !,"try and get this game to work in Vista, I dare you.with 3gb memory, an 8800 GTS video card, and the game looks like Quake back in 1995... what the hell is going on ??? No patch, no support, no help.. go to hell if you think I'm recommending this turd to my friends. PUARFS!"
3,Is there DRM on this version of Crysis?,I know there are tons of reviews concering DRM on the Crysis Warhead version. Does anyone know if there is DRM with this version? Please advise.
2,What a Disapointment,Do Not buy this game it will bring you pc to a stand still.It doesnt even compare to Far Cry. The game play is terrible The graphics would be ok if you had some super computor to run it on The hype on this game was unbelievable. I played the game twice then went right back to COD4 and Battlefield. I just dont know if any kind of patch could make this game better. If you own the game good luck
2,Dont believe the hype,"Sure, this game has all the tech to make it one of the best looking games on the market. The problem is no computer can run it. The graphics are just not optimized as well as they could be. My comp can run games like Call of Duty 4 smooth and the difference in appearance is amazing.Gameplay is fun for the first 2/3 of the game and the ability to put attachments on weapons is a cool feature. The storyline however drags on and like most fps, is very weak.Sure this game may be a breakthrough in technology, however its just not that fun to play. Graphics does not equal good gameplay"
4,Addictive,"This game has turned out to be pretty addictive when playing. Time just slips away as you progress thru the game. Graphics are wonderful, levels interesting and once in awhile a little overwhelming until you try another approach to solving the level. All in all, a game that is worth the price, doesn't become boring, levels usually offer something new, and is just plain fun to play."
3,most overrated FPS,"this game was looking great until it hit that alien spaceship section which killed the atmosphere - I had to force myself to go through it in several sessions and even after exiting that hellhole the game had gone downhill for good. The positives are the jungle bit (very well done) and the surprise that my 3 yr old system boosted by an extra 1GB of Ram and a 1950xt card factory overclocked allowed me to play the game at full-spec for 90% of the time regardless of what trade magazines say - don't believe the hype! Play medal of honor airborne instead, a great fun game"
1,SecuROM DRM = EA lost another customer!,"Includes SecuROM, enough said! Get a clue EA; you just lost another potential customer! If you don't know what SecuROM is, Google it."
4,no hitch download except...,"no hitch download for windows 7 64bit except i needed to play with direct x 9 (not 10) or game would freeze up when trying to change things in the options menu ie setting custom keys. i right clicked game in START MENU and chose play with direct x 9 and it worked like a charm. saw others were having this same problem online and tried patches ect...in fact not sure if you need to install the patch before this solution will work or not, im not about to uninstall the patch to find out."
4,Download a graphics tweak and see the incredible difference!,"I have a 8600gt video card, 3gb ram, and Core 2 Duo Processor. When I first adjusted the in-game video settings, Crysis looked like utter junk. I had everything at ""high"" (except post processing at ""medium"") with 1024x768 resolution with no AA/anti-aliasing. The game looked pretty bad, and I was very upset. To make it short, I downloaded a graphics tweak for a mid-range system and everything looks great. With the tweak I use, foliage occasionally pops up, but the textures are very nice. Crysis is definitely the best-looking game I've played. However, Crysis requires a tweak to get suitable graphics and performance.Gameplay 4/5: linear towards end and enemy encounters can become frustrating."
1,"Worst Game Ever written. Does not deserve the name ""software"".","This game is the webster's definition of garbage. The gameplay is an absolute joke. Set your suit to maximum armor, and shoot. Um, sorry but Red Faction has a better plot and multiplayer. I am not kidding. I can't pay someone enough to take this s^^% off my hands. Avoid at all costs, and it costs to play this game too. This brought my top-of-the-line machine with 2 gigs of DDR2 1000, and a core 2 duo e6600 to about 1/4 FPS at max settings with an overclocked/unlocked 8600 GTS. Fraps read zero, i had to count the frames. Turning things down to low at 800x600 got me up into the 30's again, except when explosions or cutscenes took place."
1,Don't Buy if you have Win 7,"This is the worst game I have ever purchased. With Win7 it keeps freezing during play requiring a complete restart of the game. It won't stay in full screen mode between games. The mouse sometimes will not got to the left side of the screen (a well known problem fixed by minimizing the game, checking full screen mode in system settings and then loading the game all over again). A lot to go through when you already told it to start in full screen mode. I am running the latest 1.2.1 patch, which did no good at all. If I could get my money back I would and I definitely will not purchase Crysis 2. If I programmed this game I'd be very embarrassed to let it loose on the public."
1,Wait for Far Cry 2,Poorly written and many many glitches that is about the best that can be said. It is way way over hyped. Absolutely not recommended. Waiting for Far Cry 2
2,Ahead of its time but...,"Crysis (technically) is a visionary game and I'm sure when everyone catches up with the technical requirements in about 3-4 years history will judge it more leniently. For now, to publish a game that plays like garbage on what are considered (even now) to be good PCS shows a hubris that deserves criticism.You have to cater to your audience and dangling awesome graphics in front of the buying public as a selling point is just plain dishonest when you know that very few will be able to realize them.In point of fact you are selling a demo as the real thing."
3,Built for Intel / NVidia: My High-End AMD / ATI Doesn't play well,"AMD Phenom Black Ed. 4 X 2.5ghz4 Gig DDR2 4-4-4-12 @ 800mhzSapphire HD3800x 512 PCIE X16 DDR4IN a full aluminum tower with 5 fans (overclocks under 42C)I don't believe in spending $1000 for an equivilant Itell processor or $500 for an NVidia card! But this game, I swear, it's purpose is to not run on AMD / ATI and make gamers feel compelled to buy expensive, but no better, parts.This game can't run smooth on High, much less Very High setings! I can run ""The Witcher"" ""Bioshock"" ""Jericho"" ""Hellgate: London"" all at the highest setting and never drop a frame, but this game stutters and spits.Can't play the game, medium graphics are not up to par with PS2. I don't know what went wrong with the design of this game, but it's not special enough to condend with all the issues."
2,Overrated,"Graphics are good, but software is buggy on Vista. Frequent crashes and lockups. Game play is also a bit boring - much more linear than Farcry. Plus, for the first half of the game, there are only a few weapons that have adequate ammo and they're pretty basic (shotgun, machine gun, sniper rifle). Buy Call of Duty 4 instead."
4,"Loads of fun, but buggy","Fun game, lot of features and ways to interact with the environment.However, it is from EA and with that comes bugs. First, there are 3 patches for the game that need to be applied. Next, the final level you may have to tinker with as your system may lock up (custom built PC, I had to use the DirectX 9 Switch while launching the shortcut). Lastly, EA has some problem across all games with falling through levels (say, on a ship)."
2,Crysis Crashes,"This is a good game but does not seem to work on my Windows 7 computer. It constantly crashes to a black screen, and even through research I have not been able to determine why."
2,Terribly easy,"Amazing graphics, interesting storyline, absolutely terrible gameplay.Frankly, this game is ridiculously easy. How?1. Stealth mode.2. Headshot.3. Run, then hide until your energy recharges.4. Repeat.5. ???6. PROFIT!If you're looking to check a benchmark on graphics with a game, I would suggest you get this. If you're looking for a game that will provide fun and enjoyment? Skip this one."
1,Crysis,"Bought this game After finishing cysis Warhead but after playingfound the game stops working half way and have to star game all over again,"
3,WAY OVER RATED,I was VERY dissapointed when I played this game. So much hype over this fps and it was no where near what they said it would be. Do yourself a favor and buy a used version of the game if you must. A much better FPS would be call of duty 4. Maybe if I was a young teenager and I enjoyed games such as halo then I might have liked crysis a bit more. But if you want great graphics and gameplay ( realistic ) go with COD 4 not crysis.Such a dissapointment.
1,I gave it away...,"Okay, First... Crysis is NOT joystick friendly!!! All it supports is the XBox 360 Joystick, (they make an adapter for your PC) and although they make it look like you can, ""configuring"" the joystick is not really an option. I know, because I went out and purchased the joystick... So, you can't change what any of the joystick buttons do, because Microsoft has made that decision for you! I can not fathom Microsoft making a ""keyboard only"" game in this day and age.Also, you need to play the game with the DVD in the drive the whole time, or go through the frustration of trying to download a Trojan free .exe file patch. This game is rated ""M"" for mature, so if you don't want little ears hearing the ""F bomb"" you have to download a patch for that too... or turn the human voices off in the settings.I gave the game to a neighbor (with the above disclaimers), returned the joystick, and deleted the game from my hard drive. In my opinion, this game is a far cry from a good game..."
1,BIG disappointment,I am VERY disappointed by this game. I have a very high end gaming machine and I have problems running this at lowest settings. At higher settings it doesn't run at all. I'm running a dual core system with dual Nvidia graphics cards and this game sucks! If I could take the game back and get my money I would. Once again EA rips me off. I'll never buy another EA product.
1,not fun,"not a very engaugeing game sub par graphics. Tryed several times to play and couldent hold my intrest, Ive played board games funner."
1,Non Specific Computer Characteristics,"Was impossible to me play with this game, because need a special video card (the cost of this hard ware is over $ 300) non specificated in the web page.Also the game is a DVD non the tradicional CD.I waste my money in nothing."
3,Crysis,Straight forward shooter with very little story or plot to make it more than that. Fun to blaze away at the bad guys but the linear storyline keeps it from being a world worth exploring. Graphics and software run great but doe require heavy duty computing power.
4,"Great game, resource hog","The single player mode of this game is one of the best I've ever played. The graphics are stunning, but you must have a high-end system to play it, no exceptions. That's the only reason why I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars. I can played it maxed-out (all fans screaming, LOL), and it is exceptionally good. You do not have to follow an invisible tunnel to accomplish missions -- you can go almost anywhere, anyway you desire, which makes playing this game again so much fun!The Crytec game engine is amazing, and just keeps getting better. Crysis 2, IMHO, is the best SP FPS ever made...."
4,Best FPS game ever?,"Definitely not the best game but really close. Beautiful graphics, good story and lots of killing. My only problem with it was I could never get out of Low graphic settings. I run Dual 8500GT OC, 2.4Ghz Quad core and 4 gigs of memory and still couldn't run in medium settings without some bad slow down. Other than that, if you like FPS games and you haven't played it yet.....you better."
3,Not all it was cracked up to be,"Whilst it held my interest all the way through and was fun to play, it had several drawbacks. Installation was too fiddly, as I had to tune the game to optimise it for my system - even though it is a fairly high-end rig. This led to sub-optimal settings, which made the system not as good as the graphics on Far Cry and certainly far slower. This leads on to the next point; it was Far Cry with a different slant (eg invisibility, which made it too easy), which also led to my general feeling of ""it was OK"". I hope Far Cry 2 will address these things and return the 'wow' factor I got with Far Cry."
4,"Runs great, plays great, looks great","OK so I have just started playing this game, logging maybe 5-6 hours, but I have experienced no bug or stability issue or anything of that sort. I broke the piggy bank to upgrade my PC but I have not spent $2000 either, what some people say would need to put together a rig that can run this game.I run a 2.4GHz Core 2 Quad. 4GB RAM. Vista 32 Ultimate. 8800GTX, and a 1248x1024 monitor. The game runs very smooth with everything on Very High with no AA. Some might say the ""low"" resolution of my monitor helps. When I'm on water where there aren't too many texture maps to update, I can run with 8X AA and everything would still be smooth.Game play is great but can be annoying sometimes. For instance, you don't have a ""always run"" mode so you always move too slow unless you keep the shift key pressed. And with all that advanced technology why can't the darn binoculars let me see through thin walls and shoot them like the rail gun in True Lies???"
3,"Good game, terrible distribution","This product installs securom malware without asking the user just like Bioshock. The graphics would be amazing if you could have a GPU from the future but with the same graphics card, Bioshock looked awesome while Crysis left a lot to be wished for. The single player is very short which makes it very similar to Call of Duty games. The multi-player ""Power Struggle"" is very nice but as with other previous MP games, it is easy for some players to dominate the game.Definately buy the game but don't expect a lot."
2,Crysis needs help,"I perchest two Crysis games for me and my son one for my Dell Inspiron 9100 with a Pemtium 4 CPU 3.00 GHZ ,1 GB of ram and 256 MB AGI graphic card and the other one for a Alienware Area 51 M9750 with Core 2 CPU T7600 @ 2.33 GHZ, 4 GB of ram and 2 Nvidia Gefore Go 7950 GTX SLI 512 MB each that's 1GB of Vidio. Crysis will play on the Dell fairly good but on the Alienware it freezes all the time the colors are off the sound is off the graphics are blocky impossible to play. I down loaded all the up dates for this game no help so you can see the game only works on low end computers what's up with that? John"
2,Still needs work,Overall the controls are a little sloppy. My main annoyance is you can't switch suit modes as seamlessly as in the the video.
2,Game stop working half way through,"The game kept freezing at the same spot. I re-downloaded the game form amazon and updated my drivers, and the game still would not work. Also, i couldn't install the crysis patches, not sure why. Go buy the actual game, don't buy this download version. The game is great! The part at least i got to play."
3,My Gaphical Review #1,"""Crysis is still to this day(2010) one of the best looking and most graphically ""demanding"" games ever made. While i'm not a huge fan of the gameplay, it is amazing to look at, if you have the gaming rig to play it.""CLICK ON ALL MY REVIEWS TO SEE MY LIST OF TOP BEST GRAPHICAL GAMES EVER MADE"
4,Glitch,"This may not help anyone when pertaining to the game, but i have had the same objective problem where i complete the objective and cant figure out how to make it go away and move on. Oh and then there was the tank that somehow got launched into the air when the tank attack comes at the Korean held town. Made it easy for me to kill him though since his underbelly was exposed i just shot a missile straight in there, but still weird. Tanks don't usually fly and flip."
3,EA Value Games?,This isn't a review of the game but I wanted to make sure people realize that you're probably not going to get the version of the game you expected. When the package arrived it was the EA Value Games edition which is pretty much just the DVD: no manual and the packaging looks nothing like the picture.I don't know if this has any impact on the game itself but I really don't like being mislead as to what I'm getting. Compared to the price in store of the version pictured this is a good deal. Compared to the price of the version you actually end up with you're going to feel ripped off.
3,"More a review of ""Sold by BLS Mart and Fulfilled by Amazon"" than the game.","This is more of a review of ""Sold by BLS Mart and Fulfilled by Amazon"" than the game itself.Like many other recent purchasers I received the UK edition of this game. I imagine this is fine for most but if you have an issue this can be a problem. My issue began when I went to do the install. No CD Key. Tried contacting support in the US and they turned me away since it was a UK edition of the software.International calling should not be required to get support and from what I was told by EA US, they may not support the problem since I am in the US.Contacted Amazon and arranged for the return. Also arranged for another title return that I had not yet even opened simply because it was also a UK packaged title.Amazon really needs to step up and make sure they are shipping the correct versions within the correct territorial domains or be sure to let people know they are not getting the pictured US version/package."
2,poor imitation of Halflife,"So much hype about this game I might have been expecting too much from it.Cons:I didn't think the graphics were above average, that surprised me.AI is nonexistent. They don't hunt you down, they just shoot at anything close by they can see. Move out of their sight and they stop shooting you. They do shoot/see through plants though, which gets annoying. It's like they have a cheat that lets them ignore plants. At long range the AI ignores you as you pick enemies off like shooting fish in a barrel.I couldn't get Multiplayer working.Pros:It is playable."
4,"Pretty good, but has cliff hanger ending","I should have spent a bit more and bought the expanded version, you get really into it then it ends. The game itself isn't that long, and I played this right after playing GTA IV, which was a let down because the texture of the GTA IV experience (open sandbox, etc) makes this game seem confinded."
2,Graphics and little else,"GraphicsThe game has good graphics and physics. Even that is overrated. I am not impressed with it. I was 10x more impressed with graphics from another MODERN game about WARFARE.GameplayAfter shooting down a couple of trees the game quickly becomes stale. The suit is useless because you can only use abilities for about 3 seconds. People say that the game is open exploration. Yeah, it is, but there isnt much to explore besides jungle and the occassional Korean outpost. You mostly have one mission and you follow the nav point to get there. You are extremly weak; running into a camp full blast is useless. I had to sneak everywhere invisible and snipe with my machine gun to keep from getting killed.My final thought? Overrated. and BORING"
1,don't buy for win7 x64,"I spent about 6 hours trying to get crysis/warhead to run on my windows 7 64-bit system, and was unable to. after looking all over the internet, apparently it works on some peoples machines under vista compatibility mode, and not on others. would like to have that 6 hours of my life back, as well as a refund from amazon, but no such luck."
1,not for windows 7,I hardly ever write reviews but this one annoyed me really bad.I'm sure the game is nice but didn't get to play it at all.This software doesn't work on Windows 7 64bit. Do people even buy 32bit OSs anymore?Would be nice if Amazon brings up an alert or some kind of set of questions that customers need to answer in order to ensure compatibility with the customer's hardware before purchasing the software. 0 stars for Amazon's service regarding software purchase.
2,Great until you have to fly,The game is a superb FPS until they have you fly. The controls are the worst I have seen in nearly 20 years of computer gaming. Complete failure of design. The enemy stays right behind you and you have very little control over the aircraft. Thankfully it only lasts a few minutes.
4,Muy buenos graficos.,"Mu buenos graficos, auque requiere una pc potente para correrlo al maximo. esperemos que salga la 9800GX2"
3,"Be aware of ""EA Value Games"" versions","Ordered from seller Store Closet (fulfilled by Amazon). Was not the original version of the game, was a special ""EA value games"" edition, which is just a dvd case with the disc, no manual, and a pretty ugly looking orange box, like this:Command & Conquer Generals Deluxe Edition (PC CD) includes Command & Conquer Generals and the Zero Hour Expansion (EA Value Games Edition)Also is not an American version, as it has European ratings on it. Appears to run fine, though, but I wish I would have known which version I was ordering beforehand."
4,"Good game, high requirements, overpriced","Unclear why amazon has this for almost $100, when BestBuy has it for $28. Anyway, the game is very good (see all the websites about changing the graphics quality on DX9 in Windows XP assuming you have the PC to support that).The game has spectacular graphics. The game play is similar to other FPS games, with a nicely destructible environment, although that gets a tad old. The quality of the graphics do make a immersive experience. Your machine can't be too fast to run this game, and a monster GPU is required. If you are running a 32-bit version of windows you don't need more than 4gb of ram (your OS can't see it, so don't waste the money, and yes I know it's less than 4gb, but this is Amazon not ars-technica).Crysis 2 is soon to debut, and having experience with the first game will help with the ""story"" and gameplay."
4,Great title when price is right.,"Good:1. Got D/L version when this game is on special.2. Great action and FPS game3. Nice Graphics and Game is kind of unique in it's own way.4. No problem with downloading from Amazon and activation.Bad:1. Turn graphics all the way up, you get playable minimum 25-30 FPS, check hardware review sites before you buy this game."
4,Crysis: Maximum PC Needed,"This is by far the best looking game I've played. Even today, with games like Bulletstorm and even Crysis 2 (yeah the first one still looks better), nothing seems to surpass the level of detail that went into this game. That being said, you need a nuclear reactor-powered super computer to handle it a max settings. Kidding. My quad core overclocked hd 5870 beast handled it fine. The story is set on an island (Crytek is so creative *sarcasm*) taken over by Koreans and your job is to infiltrate, evacuate hostages, and uncover the truth. Throughout the journey you find lots of Koreans, trees, and even aliens. The lighting effects, physics of breaking palm trees and punching walls in, and explosions will leave your jaw on the floor and it will stay there. The story is whatevs. Multiplayer is fun and fast paced. Overall the game is good. Just not great. Only the graphics are great."
4,Great game 4 great price,Got the game just to pass the time at work and I actually really liked it and the great prIce was unbeatable
4,Great Game,"Great Game. If you like fast paced shooter games you will like this one. Easy to use, yet can be very challenging."
1,fail epic fail not work on w7 64,why any one they have a new gaming pc what to run a 32 bit os waste on mony the game do not run att all they got me this timemy specamd fx 8150asus sabertooth 990 moo2 gtx 560 sli16 gigs of ram 1600on ocz sd and 2 segate a 1tand the game do not run
4,Graphically pleasing and fun first-person shooter,"Amazing graphics, especially if you have the equipment to run it the way it was meant to be. Fun to play. Only complaint was the game is a bit short. Was able to finish most of the game over one weekend."
1,BUG won't let some play to the end.,"There is a serious bug with a very long trail of complaints (Google ""Crysis TAC Gun bug""), that lets you get all the way to the final ""Reckoning"" boss battle and your TAC gun will not lock on to beat the boss and finish the game. I personally have spent hours and tried every ""solution"" on the various forums and applied updates through 1.2 with no success. Apparently neither EA or Crytek will seriously acknowledge this issue probably because it seems to be an obscure hardware and 64-bit dependent bug and isn't easy to duplicate. You may or may not have this problem depending on your setup but regardless it makes my recommendation AVOID!"
4,Crysis Review,"I dislike the use of bad language and the ""F"" word in the game. Sure I know it's rating, but I hear that crap all day long I dont need to hear it in my games. The gameplay itself is very fun, very halflife 2 like except without creapy crawlies spring out at you. The cloaking ability is awesome allowing you to control the pace of the game to your liking as opposed to being forced into a mad dash firefight frenzy controlled by the game engine.Vehicles are great fun, however I am amazed that the aircraft have no joystick support.Overall I give it 4 stars, a worthy purchase... PS. the graphics are AMAZING!!"
3,How do you fix it,"Have loaded game about 6 times and have yet to get it to load properly, game support has no info as to why"
2,Not very good....,"One word...disappointing. Buy something else. The single player campaign is way too short, and the ending doesn't resolve anything. Nothing new as far as gameplay. I have an 8800 gtx, and it's playable, but not smooth. I'm sure to get max performance, you'd have to invest $1,000 in video cards, which is just nuts. I won't be buying any sequels."
4,"good gameplay, great graphics","If you're thinking about buying this item, you obviously know that has the best graphics of any game to date. But the gameplay is fun as well, and some of the later levels with the aliens are pretty sweet too. Play the demo, the first half of the game is very similar to that.Preformance:I run this game at high on everything except objects quality (which i scale back to medium) and 2x anti-aliasing, at 1280x1024 (SXGA) resolution. Getting 30-44 fps average in non combat, and 6-20 fps in combat.Rig:3.2 GHz Pentium 4 with hyperthreadingXFX Nvidia 8800 GT alpha dog edition (not the xxx variant)... and, well, that's all that you really need to know for your performance benchmarks."
3,Simply Awesome,"This is a great game overall. The graphics and audio makes the game.One hang up, after you are into the game 3/4 of the way, the load/save times become unbearable. I'm talking 10-20 minutes to load/save a game. I'm still waiting for a PC game to come out without hang-ups and need for patches. People pay a lot of money for these games and should be hassle free out of the box.Hopefully a patch will be out soon and I can finish this awesome game!"
4,"Great game, but a few annoying flaws","Crysis is an amazing game, well worth the money, but has a few annoying, near-fatal flaws. First up, the hardware issues. I have a 8800 GTS with nForce something-or-other motherboard (pretty new) and a Intel quad-core CPU (not Extreme), and I can run semi-stably on medium, becoming choppy on some parts. I'd really like to experience the best of it's graphics, but I hardly have the budget. Second, the story was blah and crapped out at times, also too short. The ending was too much of a Halo 2. Third, the multiplayer was absolutely horrible. It is still a great game, and hopefully the multiplayer issues can be fixed."
4,Technology must have a profound effect on school reform.,"Technology must play an important part in achieving school reform. It can provide students and staff with support for storing, retrieving and analyzing information that pushes beyond the limits of traditional resources. Mahlinger indcates that this will call for fundamental changes in teaching and learning. Technologies enable learners to gain control of their own learning.The book generates questions that still go unanswered: Does accessibility mean equal access? Will technology be linked to a schoolwide curriculum program?"
1,Wast-O Money,I purchased this whopping 88ci tank only to be bumbed out when this tiny empire tank arrived in the mail. Empire? really???? I got 700 shots out of the tank I received and am in the process of taking it up with the company. WRONG PICTURE IN DESCRIPTION
3,Eh,"Rating: 2.5/5I expected much better from a book that's touted as an SF classic. The background in which Gateway is set is brilliant, and the only reason why my rating's not lower. An imaginative look at how earth could be in the far future (mass exploitations in countries rich as well as poor, people thrown out the airlock when they're not of any use), the lives of the prospectors and how long space trips could be, and the brilliant concept of Gateway itself. Where the novel is extremely flawed is the absolute lack of any kind of conflict; I gave up assuming this was just a long buildup around 3/4ths of the book. There's only so much to like when the focus in a science fiction book is on the main character's psychological problems, and the climax at the end is one of the most disappointing I've read in a long time. Maybe the sequel will be better."
3,Starts out good,"Pohl's classic Gateway novel has an interesting premise that lends itself to tales of space exploration and discovery a la Star Trek. Unfortunately, Pohl never goes this route. Instead of discovering new planets, new technology, or new lifeforms he focuses almost exclusively on the protagonist's psychological problems. These are two-fold: constant fear of going on a mission and guilt because of the outcome of the last mission. The last third in particular seems concerned with the protagonist procrastinating any actions that might make this a more interesting story. Pohl's style partially makes up for the lack of plot but it's still a wasted oportunity.Fortunately there are sequels which live up to the Gateway premise, as well as Legend Entertainment's computer games which capture the atmosphere quite well."
2,Am I missing something??????????,"Along with tau zero this is my least favorite classic science fiction book. It won so many awards & is so highly praised that it is ,I admit, a classic. It did have good ideas, which it mostly ignored. Instead it talked about bleak characters, in a bleak world, doing bleak things in a bleak way,etc. Also this book gave me way too much information on the main character's sexual dysfunctions. Maybe my personal prejudices got in the way of my enjoyment of this book. For instance I dislike unrelenting bleakness & don't believe in psychology. Still I do not understand why I am the only person who disliked this book."
3,Interesting but puzzling,"I read this book with great expectations since I had heard it described as a 'classic', but I was not really happy with the experience. There is so little exposition (concerning the Heechee's for example) that one is almost through with the book before some of the important aspects of the story are understood. I did not find the 'science' very credible either. Nevertheless, I did find the main character interesting and the story does sort of grow on the reader even when all pieces of the puzzle have not fallen into place. However, I have read many, many much better pieces of science fiction - in terms of character, plot and the science aspect. This would not be one that I would consider a 'classic'."
3,I skipped the psychologist parts,This was a great book with an intriguing plot with the exception of the parts with the psychologist. The dialog in that was just pointless and I managed to completely enjoy the book and not feel like I missed out on anything by skipping over most of the psychologist parts.Don't skip the last psychologist chapter though or else you'll miss out on the ending of the story!
1,Very disappointed,"I had really looked forward to reading this book, as it has been built up as such a classic of the genre. And the premise seemed exremely intriguing. But once I started reading, I found that I had to force myself to trudge through it. I did not identify with the main character. Seems like Pohl was trying really hard to create a deep character, but it seemed contrived and phony to me. And it was just boring. I didn't care about the protagonist, and just kept wanting it to get to the parts where they would go on missions. Then when they went on missions, it was still boring and disappointing.I really wanted to enjoy this book, but maybe that was part of the problem. Perhaps it was too hyped up in my mind before I started."
1,Pure drivel!,"This was an ""Old Wave"" guys bizarre attempt to adjust to the ""New Wave"". The result is a defeatist book that spews pop-Freudian drivel. Guilt's necessary, but the book is so obsessed with it & has little else. Pure drivel!"
1,"Young Adult, I think not.","I read this in college & it had more psychobabble & sex then I felt comfortable with. This is one of the most overrated books in science fiction. The protagonist belonged on Jerry Springer, the world described was bleak to the point of parody, & the psychology seemed bogus. If psychology is that moronic then I'm glad I don't believe in it."
2,"Yawn, sex and drugs in outer space","This book is your basic teen fare from the '70s. Outer space is a place with lots of sex (alas, presented in a manner with little entertainment value), occasional pot, a Corporation that runs things, a detached and jaded narrator, and plenty of pop psychology. The tone is remarkably similar to Joe Haldeman's ""Forever War."" I suppose that 30 years ago this stuff may have seemed cutting edge, but it has not aged well. A few better bets: Asimov, Heinlein, Vinge, & Dan Simmons."
5,Makes plane flights seem short,"This is not only a great book but a great series. I travel constantly and read to pass the time. Often, I begin reading a book only to find myself looking at my watch to see how much time is left before we land because the book doesnt hold my attention. I read this entire book on one flight....the airplane landed with four pages to go and I thought ""wow, were here already??"""
5,"The harsher, but better Pohl","Gateway as an example of how good scifi can be when it carries a political/sociological edge. Like Heinlein's transition works, this book overcomes its narrative flaws and occasional slow spots with a great story and a fistful of moral messages. Instead of reading the comparatively shallow cavalcade of sequels, read ""The Gateway Trip"" to catch the rest of the story."
5,One of the best,"Loved this dramatic era of pseudo middle-aged explorations of fortune and glory. Pohl is the only SF writer i know who delt, in this book, with the psychological effect of General Theory of Relativity and it's time dilation. read it!!! (and the sequels too)"
3,Worth reading,This one has been around for a while and I found it a little tired. For dedicated science fiction fans this is worth the read but does leave questions unanswered.
4,Entertaining But Not Fantastic,"The book was entertaining, but not fantastic. The chapters alternated between psychoanalysis by a psuedo-sentient computer and then flashbacks to the actual story. Even during the story chapters, there was more focus on interpersonal relationships than on adventure. If that's what you are looking for then this book is absolutely for you. The characters were interesting and captivating, though not always well developed. For people who are looking for pure sci-fi adventure, this book isn't bad and definitely worth reading, but nothing exceptional."
5,Evokes fascination and terror.,Gateway evokes the fascination and terror of the unknown universe better than any other science fiction book I know. I agree with the reviewer who said that the other books of the series could be regarded as optional; the fascination of Gateway consists largely of the fact thet we DON'T know all the stuff about the Heechee that is revealed in the following books.Dick Ellis
5,Just plain great,"Short, sweet, and to the point - I read this one in a day; I just couldn't put it down. The sad but compelling character of Robin is the perfect vehicle for this story as we follow him through not only the pains of his life, but the wild risks he eventually takes as a result of it. Gateway, being a station almost entirely populated with people who are basically so desparate as to continually play a frightening version of Russian Roulette on the off chance they might escape one way or the other, makes for one of the more fascinating sci fi settings I've encountered. The mysetery of the long lost Heechee and the strange legacy they left behind is the perfect backdrop to the story. Read it twice!"
5,Very informative!,"I used this book to read to my son's 4th grade class for World Down Syndrome Day. We have 2 girls with Down syndrome so I wanted to bring awareness, but a lot of the books out there are geared towards younger kids. This book was great for his age group (9-10) and sparked lots of fantastic questions and interesting discussions about Down syndrome and disabilities in general. I bought this book on a recommendation from a friend and I'm so glad I did! My son's teacher asked me to come back next year and read it again to her new class. :)"
4,A Fasinating Book,I thought this book had a lot of essential information for people who wanted to learn about the facts of suicide and attempted suicide. It's not a weak book that skates aroud the truth. It tells every bit of information straight out.I also like the fact that it describes the various methods very straight forward and in detail. It's extremely difficult to find a book like this.I thought it was execellent.
2,Why is this book so expensive?,I'm very confused. Why is this running used at almost $90 when you can get it from Barnes & Noble for $20?
1,...,"though i never read the book in its entirity, i did find the hanging/strangulation instructions downloaded and saved on my young brother's computer. i found the instructions just a few hours after i found him hanging, dead, in his basement. the authors book may have had redeeming qualities, but that which he choose to make most accessible to the general public via his webiste was that which was most destructive. for any person, for any writer, the act to conciously choose violence over life is dangerous, not just in theory but in action as well. i hold no one responsible for my brother's suicide but himself, but i cannot help but wonder if he would have acted so rashly if he hadn't had access so readily to Geo Stone's (psuedo name) book."
1,Sick!!,I thought that this was a sick book! A person who is feeling suicidal needs uplifting and care. This book just shows them how to kill themselves in a more efficient way. A suicidal person reading this would probably kill themself in the next day because this tells you exactly what to do. It made me sick!!!
1,DISGUSTING and APPALLING!!!!,"From someone who has lost her father to suicide, I find this book completely disturbing. No, I have not read it and I never will read it. I cannot believe that there is a book out in circulation that cooks up methods on how to take one's life. It is an utter trajedy for the person suffering from attempting or completing suicide and I can wholeheartedly tell you what a tradjedy it is for those who are left with no answers and all the feelings that go with this selfish decision. Shame on the author who wrote this and to those who are reading this. Better to spend your money on an appointment with a therapist! By the way I was FORCED to give this book one star before submitting my opinion."
2,Retelling of Verne Classic Undercut by Artwork!,"Jules Verne's classic tale of underwater adventure joins the ranks of Saddleback 'Illustrated Classics' in this 2006 release. Few other novels offer artistic possibilities as great as 20,000 LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA. Unfortunately, Saddleback's artwork is the book's weakest link.Intended to introduce young readers to classic novels, the Saddleback volumes I've reviewed have varied from fair to poor. Their version of 20,000 LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA does a fair job of condensing the novel down to 56 pages. A little more pruning was probably called for since some strips are overflowing with dialogue. A bigger problem though is the book's artwork. It's poorly done and often amateurish. I don't know if it will entice younger readers into wanting to read the original. And $9.95 seems a bit much price-wise.I'd rate this an optional purchase. There are better versions of this book available. Check out the 'Classic Starts' series from Sterling."
1,A big disappointment - save your money!,"I purchased this book as a Christmas gift for my nephew. I was expecting a paperback version of the original story punctuated by some colorful illustrations. What I got was basically a comic book.The description states that the book ""features classic tales retold with attractive color illustrations."" In plain English, that means the book is 70 pages of bold, cartoonish drawings that tell the story via ""thought bubbles"" like those you find in comic books. There are sporadic phrases from the original book sprinkled throughout, but not exactly as part of the story.I was very disappointed with this book.Also, part of the spine was torn slightly during transit, so I returned the book for a full refund. I have since purchased an illustrated paperback (what I was looking for in the first place) at Barnes & Noble."
3,Comic Book Version of Verne's Classic Tale!,"This 2006 version of JOURNEY TO THE CENTER OF THE EARTH is one of the Saddleback series designed to introduce new readers to classic novels. The Saddleback books are apparently a 21st Century attempt to ape the fondly remembered 'Classics Illustrated' comic books of the 1950s. This is the second Saddleback volume I've read and I have mixed feelings about it.The book throws readers a curve ball of on page 1; most of the characters had been renamed! Professor Lidenbrock is now Professor Van Hardwigg; Axel is Henry Lawson; etc. Why the name change?The Saddleback version generally follows Verne's plot with actual dialogue taken from the novel. The illustrations are so-so; very colorful, often amateurish yet sometimes effective. It's a pity the artist who did the cover art couldn't have done the inside illustrations as well.If this gets kids hooked on the classics, more power to 'em! On balance, I'd recommend the book although it is over-priced at $9.95."
1,Really Bad,Review by my 11-year-old son: This book is very bad!The graphics are like Japanese anime. I had to read it as a school assignment. I Hate it!!!
3,Good to read if you like mysteries,"This was a pretty good book. It was kinda boring for a long time but if you get into it it's not that bad.The lanuge they use in the book(old english)can get really annoying. Sometimes it is really hard to understand. Overall it was a pretty good book, but it was log and sometimes really boring.I recomend this book to people who have alot of time to read, its long and hard to understand."
4,An fine book for beginning to intermediate coaches,"This is a fine book for beginning to intermediate youth coaches. The book is especially strong in pointing out the proper forms for passing, shielding, kicking, and receiving the ball. Note: your kids will never become good soccer players unless they first know the proper techniques, and then can execute them. (It's dissappointing to see our top national team players fail to use proper form when receiving a rolled ball...something they should have learned at U-8!) This book explains the techniques clearly, with good photo illustrations. Book is weak on dribbling moves -- get Coerver for that. Good practice drills.But the technical descriptions is where this book shines."
4,From The Author,Thank you for buying the book. Please look for my new book out Fall 2000 on women's soccer.
5,AT HIS VERY BEST,"Simply said, ""This is truly Curtis Mayfield At His Very Best."" Iespecially loved Track #15 ""Between You Baby And Me""."
2,Disappointed Mayfield Fan,"Having grown up listing to Curtis' many songs, I was disappointed in the selections contained in this dvd. I wish I had listened to the samples before ording."
5,Great read,"""Nervous conditions"" is a book about colonialism and the alienating influence it has on people who lose touch with their roots. It is a dilemma for African children who are seeking education who often find that in adopting the new culture of the colonizers, they often can no longer associate with the traditional ways of their own people. This superbly written book will touch any reader to the core. The writer clearly dissected the negative effects of colonialism and the settler-politics that caused so much strife in Zimbabwe, creating two tragedies in the persons of Ian Smith and Robert Mugabe. We see those consequences in Triple Agent Double Cross, No Longer at Ease, The Oaf. This very powerful and touching novel is not only revealing but also opens our minds to more questions, the most powerful of which is the problem of the ""colonized mind', a diseases that is still plaguing Africa today."
3,Decent,"I would say that it is somewhere between 3 and 4 stars, but I'll just give it 3. I liked the ending, which I found haunting and riveting. As for the rest of the book...sometimes it just moved slowly in a boring way - like an endless cloud or blanket. Even after finishing the book, I still felt like I didn't know Tambudzai as a character because it seems that she is always naive and confused, and following behind in the footsteps of someone else - in this case, Nyasha. Tsitsi Dangarembga has talent, no doubt, but there is room for improvement."
4,"no ""women-only""...","...because who of us doesn't live a nervous condition? Its deep involvment with the meaningful place-and-time of the setting notwithstanding, this novel has all the powerful nuances of a Bildungsroman, facing anguishes and dilemmas (inferiority complex, origin-versus-progress, desire to break out) that are part of our life. And if women from all over the world will find their own experiences of discrimination mirrored in those lived by Tambu and the other female characters, men will meet the manifolded, powerful portrays of male chatacters who are all bound to ""carry on the tradition in the normal, unanalytic male fashion""...A ""free-your-mind"" reading to everyone!"
3,informative loook at post-colonial Africa,"I learned some interesting things about Africa and indigineous vs. colonized society, and I felt like, after shutting the book, I had expanded my knowledge in an area I will never truly be able to understand.As far as story goes within the novel, I felt like I was getting a little too much ""tell"" instead of ""show,"" and that it was almost set up in vignettes as opposed to a whole novel. The last paragraph made me feel like the novel wasn't ending, but merely closing a chapter.All in all, I would say read it, for it isn't a story one often hears, and it was very interesting, but read it more for expansion than story."
5,Nervous Conditions,Disturbing but honest look at the struggles of identities in the face of colonialism.
5,The best Vegetarian Book I have ever read thus far,"I am not a strict vegetarian and often get confused or uninterested in the menus many vegetarian cookbooks offer.Cathe Olson has written a simple book, easy menu's, and most of all delicious recipes.We have been enjoying so many tasty items from this cookbook. Not only for pregnant women, but for the entire family and your friends."
1,Very disappointing!,"I have been helping my daughter with her new baby and have tried a dozen or so recipes from this book. Raised 5 kids of my own, vegetarian for over 20 years. These recipes have not gone over well. Expensive, bland or in some cases barely edible. Wheat biscuits like lead, Shepards pie went in the trash, Cauliflower with walnuts... Of course the nuts just lay in the bottom of the bowl. I keep swearing I'm done with this and then give it another chance. I will use Vegetarian Times and Mooswood from now on. Sorry!"
2,Just okay,"I don't find the recipes in this book especially appealing. I'll be sticking to my Moosewood cookbooks. I've read enough about nutrition during the vegetarian pregnancy that I know what I need to get in my diet, even without this book."
2,Pregnant and lazy,"I bought this to help me eat right while pregnant. i have been a vegetarian for years. i wanted to make sure I was getting the perfect nutrtion for my growing baby. The book is pretty informative. It does contain shopping lists and tons of recipes. I found that the recipes seemed a bit complicated, because of the amount of ingredients needed and its not just stuff that most people would have lying around the house. I haven't cooked anyhting out of the book yet, but have used a lot of the tips she offers. I guess I am just not much of a cook. I am a young newlywed with all the time in the world, but I am pregnant and therefore exhausted. I also don't have the cash to spend on all the weird ingredients you need on hand, which I would have to buy at the local co-op which is super expensive. If you love cooking this book is great, if you are looking for simple recipes or info on vegetarian pregnancy, seek out another resource."
4,The Vegetarian Mothers Cookbook,"The book is one of the few cookbooks, vegetarian and non-vegetarian alike that shares my philosophy of not using refined sugars in my cooking. I have enjoyed the recipes so far that I have prepared. I would recommend this book to both vegetarians and non-vegetarians, even if they were not pregnant."
3,Mixed review,"Being a vegetarian for over 10 years, I was excited to start reading this book and making the recipes. The introduction has a lot of great information on general types of food you should eat, and helpful guides for which recipes are best for which trimester.I have two problems with the recipes: 1) the food is bland. My meat-eating husband usually likes all the vegetarian food I cook, but he didn't like any of these, and I don't blame him -- they just didn't taste great; 2) many of the recipes are complicated, so as my pregnancy moved along and it became harder for me to stand up in the kitchen cooking for an hour, I found myself just not cooking from this book.The biggest pro of the recipes are that I did feel good after eating the prepared food. I felt full and energetic, without feeling bloated.Overall, a mixed bag. The recipes are complicated and bland, but I felt good after eating the food."
5,Awesome!,This cookbook has been great. I ordered it when I was 8 weeks pregnant and it has opened my eyes on protein and vitamin content of different foods. The recipes (especially dinner) are incredible. I have not tried one dish that I didn't love. I eat fish and dairy so I am not a true vegitarian and this book has suggestions to add dairy to recipes and has given me new ideas on what to eat with fish. I will use this after I have the baby because the recipes are excellent.
1,Shoddy Product,Ordered Directly from their website. Item came packed with newspaper ad packing. Grenade was wobbly and did not sit flush to base. Base looked rather cheap. Complaint dept. sign was a STICKER on the base. It was not applied well with a big air pocket across the middle of it. I hope I can sell this on Craigslist now...
4,Grenade,It looks fine. The picture shows a wall mounted version but there was no choice for that when I ordered.
4,"Good Overview, But Leaves Major Events Out","If someone is looking for a good, easily read, overview of English History, Christopher Hibbert is a logical choice. His 'The Story of England' is both entertaining and informative. However, if you already know something of English history, you will be amazed at the short shrift he gives to major events such as World War I & II, the Wars of the Roses, and some literary/social events that are certainly worth mentioning. Hibbert does well with the ancient history sections, and he does throw in great anecdotes on people and places that are accurate as well as fun to read. Hibbert also includes timelines and maps for both England and World history, and several royal family trees to pin down dates and people. For a beginning book on this subject, I would highly recommend it."
4,Wonderfully original work in Andean music,"I first played this one while I was working, and only half-listening... but it grabbed my ears and I had to go sit down and listen to it -- its just beautiful!The first 7 selections comprise a Catholic Folk Mass, all done in the Andean style with Folk instruments, and the vocals of Mauricio Venegas-Astorga are among the best I have heard in Andean music ( and I have a big collection!) The music varies from slow-moving to very bright and fast. Music is a subjective thing, very much in the ""ear of the beholder"", but I believe this CD will be appreciated by anyone who has enjoyed the Andean style, and by many others as well.I did not like the second section ( Part 2, # 8 - 12) as well, thus my 4 stars instead of a full 5. However, that section is still above average in my opinion."
1,Does not work with the FR500 solarlink,"I am sure this is a fine adapter, however it does not work with the fr500 solarlink, even though amazon leads one to think so. Of course i cant be too harsh, i should have read things closer, but shame on you amazon for leading me astray."
1,Poor return policy,"Charger made the screen of the radio go blank and did not charge battery. Now the radio does not work except on the AAA disposable batteries.To make matters worse I have to pay to return the charger and the shipping cost is only a couple dollars less than the cost of the charger.Needless to say I am just going to throw it out. I am out the cost of the charger, original shipping, and have a damaged radio."
1,9x13 it is not!,"This dish turned out to be a mere 7-3/4"" x 11"" which made it totally unsuitable for the recipe for which I bought it. (No way that 16 manicotti shells were going to fit in there.) At this price, it's an OK product if you have need of a dish of this small size and it does have the advantage of being able to go under the broiler. Surprisingly few ceramic dishes are able to accomplish that feat. If, however, you absolutely, positively need 9"" x 13"", steer clear."
1,Overall not a well made product.,"Just received today. Not 13 x 9 because it fits inside my Pyrex 13 x 9 pan (also, the volume is exactly the same despite the fact that the sides are 1/2 higher). The porcelain finish also has several flaws and post production scratches. Consider spending a bit more for a better brand."
5,Great Pan,I bought this pan specifically for my Breville Smart Oven so I could bake in the summer without turning on my oven. It fits perfectly especially since it doesn't have handles that get in the way or compromise the size of the pan. Now I can bake my roasts as well as my cakes in this pan without having to use my regular oven.
1,No Handles,Product Description is incorrect. Pan does not have handles. Why would one want to take a broiler pan out of the oven without handles? Risky. I see the picture is accurate but I made the mistake of trusting the text and item number over the imate. Very disappointed.
3,Genteleman's Agreement,"Perhaps because I saw the 1947 Academy Award winning movie first, I liked it better than the book, but I truly think the movie explored the theme of prejudice against the Jews better than the book did and with more finesse. The book seemed heavy handed by comparison."
4,Gorgeous Shoe!,"Beautiful shoe. I would recommend getting a half size bigger, other than that they are great. I get so many compliments."
4,Pretty good but...,"Overall I like this. It was a little too tight for me and it didn't really fit across my shoulders. However, most girls aren't as broad shouldered or picky as me, so I'll give it that. The material is soft, I love it, and the great thing is that its actually warm. At the moment I don't wear it too often, but in the spring I'll probably pick it back up.Generally its a good buy, not overly expensive, just watch your sizing on it. It runs a little small."
4,Great scanner overall,"The scanner works great... my only complaint is that initially it puts the scanned files in the most obscure place...""C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Documents\DigiScan""This can be changed... or you can do like I did and just make a desktop shortcut to get there quickly. Other than that... it works very well. We even scanned some Christmas photos from the local sporting megaplex that were supposed to be ""Unscannable"".You can change the resolution from 100 DPI through 600 DPI to vary your file size. If I had a complaint... it would be that you can't save as a PDF directly... we use that for our expenses. But it does JPG, TIFF, and BMP really well."
1,Copies were terribly light.,"I am very dissatisfied with this product. We simply needed a scanner for paperwork. We needed to scan it and email it...that's it. Simple enough! you'd think. The copies scanned were barely gray. I opened them with microsoft photo editor, and it darkend them a little bit...but still barely legible. We have a brother scanner and it is worth the extra money. I would NOT reccommend this product to my worst enemy."
2,"OK product, Difficult to install and get working.","The item was delivered promptly. However, I had considerable difficulty getting it to work on Windows 7 64 bit and each time I want to use, I have to recalibrate it first, or the scan results are horrible. It works for a mobile scanner, but just barely."
2,Bad Product,"The scanner came as promised and was packaged well. However, it saved scans to a strange folder, had a hard time finding it. Then had to change the folder all scans were being saved to. Then it stopped working after about 10 or 15 scans so I ended up completely removing all software then reinstalling that worked for about 2 scans and now it's not working again. I am going to return it for a refund."
1,Does not work with Win 7 pro 64bit,"I'm very dissapointed with this product. Other feedback states that this product works with Windows 7. I should have dug further as after spending hours downloading various drivers the product would not work with any of my win 7 64bit machines. [...] has no drivers available and genius-europe site has a ""windows 7 driver"" but would not work with my 64bit systems."
5,Genius Colorpage-SF600 Sheet fed Scanner,"This space-saving, inexpensive scanner is very effective for scanning documents. It is a great tool for keeping your office organized."
4,Good little scanner,"We bought this scanner to reduce the amount of paper in our home files. It's a little slow, but it does a nice job of saving documents and even makes good copies of pictures. We bought another one after our cat pushed the first one off the desk and broke it. I'd recommend it to someone trying to reduce clutter at home."
3,Device software driver not updated in the package ...,"The portable scanner is light and would be a great device.However, the software driver in the package does not include the version for Window 7. Factory's web-site has three Window 7 driver updates, but none seems to install well. I have worked well over 2 hours on the installation without complete success. It could have been that my PC has Win 7 64 bits operating system, while the update of the driver is only for Window 7 32 bits. Not entirely sure where the problem is. I would like to urge the manufacture to fix the problem."
1,Just didn't work,"Physically seemed like a nice piece of hardware but it simply didn't work. Installed the drivers from the web rather than the disk so I would be sure to have the latest version. Seemed to install properly and asked me to do a calibration after install. Since the calibration ran fine I assumed install was correct. When I tried to scan I got images that looked like digital noise. Tried multiple times with the Digiscan software, omni page, and with the Business card reader. Never got anything but noise. Tried to call tech support but they were closed. Software seemed cumbersome anyway. Decided to just return it. Am going to try the Fujitsu ScanSnap 1300. More money and larger but hopefully will work better. Scanners aren't rocket science and they aren't new so I don't know why they shouldn't just work right out of the box."
4,scanner,I am still trying to figure it out but I like the fact that it is portable. Once I know how to fully use it things will be a lot better. Besides that it's wonderful machine.
1,Genius is no Genius DO NOT BUY,I bought this scanner hoping to scan all of my files and go paperless. What a joke. I installed the software and set up my computer files. I started scanning one by one until I had scanned over 2000 documents into different files. I was so excited and thought everything was fine until I scan an item and get a message from the scanners software: memory full. That was it no other warning no nothing. So I started to put all my files on a storage drive and guess what NO FILES. The software deleted everything. I bought two recovery programs to retrive the files but neither worked. So I called the company. What another waste of time and a joke. Then I emailed their customer technology center. This guys name is ARIE or something like that. He does not know anything or have any suggestions to help me. I did a little research and this seems to be a common problem with this scanner. DO NOT BUY...
1,do not buy this a warning,This was defective did not work at all.. do not waste your money on this..dena
1,Wrong shipment sent:,"The wrong shipment was sent to my office. Returned and requested a refund and it was granted. In retrospect, I do believe I read a previous post that indicated the same. I would not waste my time buying one here. Goodluck!"
3,Dissapointed by what's NOT here,"I bought this collection expecting it to be a 'definitive' collection, but I'm very disappointed by what's NOT here, clips that are readily viewable on YouTube. I'm not talking about the songs cut because of licensing issues, I'm talking about clips like ""Musical Office"", one of Kovac's best-known - I'd would have preferred that to the ""News report with Leroy L. Leroy"", which goes on WAY too long and isn't particularly funny. Also, the only time we see the famous 'pat the car on the fender and it falls through the floor' gag is in a special feature interview, talking about how expensive that gag was, and not standing alone or as part of an episode. Why? If these other clips are available, why aren't they in the collection? I can't believe what's here is all there is."
3,Only because it's Ernie,"Had this video featured anyone else, I would have given it two stars. A Great disappointment. I grew up with this guy's programs starting in the early 50s, so I know what he did and what he was capable of doing. Unfortunately, precious little of that material was included in this collection. Instead, it looks like a compilation of what was left over after all the other collections and compilations were released. I'm sure that that the legal restrictions placed on the production of this collection were great and very limiting, but he gave you so much to choose from. What happened to the shows from the early 50s? They were some of his most creative and extemporaneous, but no hint of that talent here. Where was the Nairobi Symphony (not early 50s)? what about EEFMS? And Choco-spin?Sorry folks, you tried, but I don't call several 15 minute-segments of humorless video a hit. But, thanks for the effort."
2,Disappointed,"We were bitterly disappointed in this collection. It is disjointed, promised starsdo not appear, etc. Bought it mostly for the Nairobi Trio which apppeared only twice in the whole collection - for seconds. It's very pricey for the contents."
2,THE ERNIE KOVACS COLLECTION,I guess I was expecting too much! The early shows were not very funny or especially innovative either. It didn't get dramatically better. All in all I should have saved the $50.00 and remembered the Ernie Kovacs Shows dimly but in a much more favorable light!
1,only for the die hard fan,"only for the die hard ERNIE KOVACS FAN -- i watched these TV programs live in the 1950's and i NOW find they were not very well done BUT i now know that the 'dazzle' was about the media and not the content. i will add, Soupy Sales was along the same concept BUT it was funny and the E/K shows were NOT funny....mainly just boring and stupid....along the same line as Charlie Chaplin [a newly style of entertainment ] but boring.BTW i am a huge fan of Monty Python group and Soupy Sales"
5,Kovacs,Classic tv from the greatest comedian of all time. A wonderful cd set that is worth every penny of the purchase price.
3,"Not bad, not great","I am currently using this book for an advanced Geometry class. The book works well in conjunction with a well taught class, which I thankfully have. The text contains a lot of information, although not all of the mathematical subtleties are brought to the readers attention, and are either left as exercises or for the student to ponder further. Greater analysis of deep and complex concepts would have been appreciated, and some answers to the problems would have been helpful as well -- the book contains none, which is a shame because the exercises are pretty good and are a requirement to master the material. I can understand why my professor likes this book, but it can be difficult to learn from if you haven't been exposed to the material before, and especially if you need to rely on it as a primary source of information."
2,Defective book,"My review is basically a warning about a defective stock of books. I ordered one January 2012 at it was printed backwards, and when I requested a replacement, it was also printed backwards (I promise I'm not crazy, it really was backwards). They can't replace it a second time, and at any rate, it probably means the whole stock was defective. I let customer service know and they gave me a discount, but I thought I'd put out a warning. If you order this book close to January 2012, you might get a backwards one."
1,I gave it one star because I can't give it zero.,"""The proof of this is left as an exercise."" Get used to that phase, it's underneath just about every theorem and corollary in the book."
1,Roads To Geometry Review,"I'm using this book for a math elective (Survey of Geometry), and I think the book is awful! I was expecting something more like a textbook and this is just about the furthest thing from that. Even my professor is having a difficult time teaching out of it. Probably the biggest problem with it is that there aren't any answers in the back of the book like most math books have. Also, my professor couldn't even obtain an answer key because it doesn't exist."
1,Roads to Geometry - Traffic Jam,"I am currently enrolled in a college course that uses this text.The book contains no study guide or solutions section and the frequent statement throughout the text is ""proof of ... is left as an excercise."" If you don't know the solutions before you read the text, then spend your money and time reading another book."
3,Ghost Rider,"The special effects were great. The bad guys were pretty fierce But lets face it...the story line of the guy being a stunt motorcycle rider with a love story wrapped around it was pretty lame. Still liked it, but not one of my top movies."
5,BOO HOO TO THE FEW ??????,"Excellent movie all the way around although I prefer the Sons of the Pioneer's rendition of ""Ghost Riders in the Sky"".Would have bought it no matter who got the lead role - Cage just added a bit more class.Eve still had her body exploited in the clothing. Glad she [as her character] walked away.Fabulous renditions of the Rider's bike - really enjoyed the featurettes and the commentaries - they covered more of the story plot and the characters than the strict technicalities.Enjoyed seeing the natural exchanges between the actors in the special features.Love Sam Elliott - he was made for his part. New that voice before ever he showed up. What a man! Presence, charisma, sexy voice.This movie just makes the comic characters more real - Am glad I collected some of them.These comic book character renditions in movies just keep getting better.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED - DEFINITELY A KEEPER."
2,EVA MENDES,This sucky movie gets a 2 stars. You could name one star EVA and the other MENDES because her scenes in the movie are the only things keeping you from blowing ur head off watching this horrible movie.1. Plot is really cheesy(WHEN WILL PEOPLE LEARN NOT TO SALE THEIR SOULS TO THE DEVIL?).2. Casting and costume designs are slightly cheesier than the plot(EMO demons are not scary!)3. subtract 3 stars just for having Nick Cage anywhere near the movie.4. Sam Elliot gives an OK performance.
1,One of the worst movies I've ever seen,"No joke, and I'm not trying to be funny. It really was that bad. The only people giving this movie good reviews are kids and people who lie to themselves thinking that this is a good movie. No, I've never read the comic book, but who cares. People can't use the excuse, ""well, you just don't get it cause you never read the comic"". NO! This is an awful movie, period. With or without the comic book knowledge Mark Steven Johnson should stop making movies. He made daredevil horrible and now this horrible ""film"" if you can even call it that."
1,Bad joke,"Nicolas (I can't act) Cage manages to turn one of Marvel comic's most interesting properties into a painful bad, BAD joke.Cage manages to turn an 18 year old Johnny Blaze into a balding 40 year old Elvis impersonator.Nic Cage continues to cement his claim to fame as the worst actor in Hollywood (yes that includes the Twilight freaks, and the cast of Seinfeld).This is just as painful as Catwoman, and watching the Merc with the Mouth turned into a mute in Wolverine.Please Cage for the love of all that is holy just stop acting (trying to) before some innocent person gets hurt.WORST ACTOR IN HOLLYWOOD >>PERIOD!.BTW before someone tells me Im wrong check youtube for the MASS amount of clips about Why Cage is in fact the worst actor ...ever."
4,Action/Chick Flick,"Didn't see it at the movies because of less than stellar reviews, but... One to watch with your g/b friend... action for the adventurer and cheese for the romantic...two thumbs up!"
4,if once... go ahead,"Ghost Rider was likely to be made into a movie... an animated feature would have worked.Following the `how it all began' premise, Ghost Rider starts with Johnny Blaze and hisfather performing at a carnival and making a decision that determines what life Johnnywill have. The movie's incarnation of Johnny Blaze is older than in the comic book andquite a risk-taker... leading to Ghost Rider, the judge, jury and executioner. I lovethe flame effects of Ghost Rider's skull and the bike design was impressive.Peter Fonda as the devil... who else was there?"
3,Little disappointed,My kids love the movie ghost rider but the dvd i recieved was a different verson from the one we rented. It was delivered quickly that i was happy about.
5,Whhoooo Hoooooo!!!!!!,What a ride. I read these comic books when I was a kid and the movie is everything I could have hoped for. Highly recommend!!!
4,Special Effects Magnifico,I am glad this is only a scientific movie and not reality. It would cause some movie fans to be fearful of the portrayal of Satan. It is also not a flick to believe wholeheartedly.
3,A weak movie saved by the finale,"""Ghost Rider"" is an action movie starring Nicolas Cage as Johnny Blaze, a good guy who by mistake sells his soul to the Devil (called Mephistopheles in the movie). With the help of supernatural powers, Blaze morphs into Ghost Rider, the Devil's own bounty hunter. Strangely, he can use the devilish powers for good ends, something that eventually enables him to turn on Mephistopheles himself.The movie is quite weak, as movies based on comics tend to be. The plot is illogical at times. ""Ghost Rider"" is saved to some extent by the dramatic finale, where Johnny Blaze confronts Blackheart, a fallen angel who has come to create Hell on Earth.Most of ""Ghost Rider"" only deserves two stars, but because of the ending, I give it three.A weird fact: when I watched this film on Swedish TV, all cable channels suddenly went off line in my neighbourhood, immediately before the rider's last stand with Blackheart! Creepy. Is Mephisto watching us, or...?"
2,Burn baby burn,"I must agree with ma017's review. Too much devoted to the visual effects, which are truly spectacular, and way too little effort spent on an intelligent story and character development. The direction was substandard also. You have a great cast who deliver their lines like they can't wait to get it over with so they can collect their check and burn rubber getting out of there;-). The hottest thing about this movie is Eva Mendes who has way too little screentime IMHO."
2,A really bad movie.,When I saw the trailer for Ghost Rider I thought it was going to be a good movie but I was wrong. Ghost Rider was so poorly put together. There weren't any good or fun action scenes to enjoy and the acting wasn't really great. The effects are good and Ghost Rider looks great but the movie is only enjoyable for 8 year olds. If they make Ghost Rider 2 I will still check it out but hope it's better than the last one.
2,Rent don't own,"If you have a night with nothing to do it's not completely terrible. However, I wish I'd rented it before purchasing."
3,Please enter a title for your review,"The only scene that struck me as creative was when Johnny's using his motorcycle skills on the freeway trying to harass his ex-girlfriend into pulling over. The main problem with most of it is the lulls between action sequences don't have much relevence to them, no scheming or planning, so there's no anticipation or speculation about what's going to go down next or how something's going to pan out. There's nothing tying it all together. The supposed emotional character moments also were too quick to the punch to convey any real humanity."
2,Ugggh Nicolas another bomb?,Cage -- you either love his movies OR hate them. I hated this. Typical comic book turned into movie. Read the comic and save your money on this one.
4,great movie,loved the good over comes the bad and nicholas cage did a greatjob of the ghost rider. glad that i bought it.
1,Awful,"Beware... This film combines Nicholas Cage's lack of acting talent with a terrible script. The results are disastrous. I read the comic book a few times back in the eighties, so I was familiar with the story of Ghost Rider, but not particularly a fan. I do remember enough to know that they could have made a decent film with the content."
3,Better than I was led to believe,"Given the terrible reviews I had read, I expected this to be one of the worst movies ever produced. Luckily, this was not the case. Now, I will be the first to acknowledge the problems, Nicholas cage was too old for the role, eva mendes drained the life out of every scene, and some things made absolutely no sense (what was with the old ghost rider riding with him for the journey, then just stopping before the fight? This was what he waited for all these years?) But there was a few fun points. The effects were great, I enjoyed the bad guys, and I wish there was more actual Ghost Rider. An interesting begining, that could lead to a better sequel, should it ever occur. Worth a look when nothing else is available."
3,Hit and Miss,"First let me say that I love comic movies and this one was worth watching.Cage plays the same role he always does, his acting style has not changed. I cant say whether he was meant for this role or not because I can't think of anyone else who could. But this movie could have been done MUCH better. Not all the blame is on Cage though.The script was poorly written, very cliche jokes and bad dialogue. The directing was terrible also, the fight scenes were simple and left you wondering if you had missed several minutes of each scene.It trys to take on the feeling of the old Punisher movie but misses. I hope in ten years this movie is redone and done better."
2,one of the worst comic adaptations,How is this movie getting 3-5 stars at all? for the effects. I read ghost rider and was a big fan so I was excited that they could do it right. As in transformers they got the effects right but nothing else. Sam Elliot was the only good thing out of this movie.
4,I Saw It in the Theater,"I saw this when it was in the theaters and it is pretty good. This is Johnny Blayze millenium version of Ghost Rider played by Nick Cage. A lot of action violence and plays almost like a horror film. This is one of the more off beat of the entries found in the 2000s trend for comic book super hero movies because Ghost Rider is like a demon avenger on a motorcycle and made a deal with Zarathos, an unholy devil. I liked it. I'm a fan of the 90s Dan Ketch incarnation of Ghost Rider and this holds up pretty well to fans of the comic."
2,This Rider Doesn't Go Down Easy,"""Ghost Rider"", which came out theatrically in February of this year, stars Nicolas Cage in the title role and is based on a comic-book series, so I wasn't expecting ""Citizen Kane"" on a chopper, and I did have some intermittent fun with the flashy film. However, overall it's kind of a mess. The action sequences, though ultimately empty exercises, are often exciting, and when the movie keeps it light and airy, there's an enjoyable exuberance to the proceedings (but all too often, it dips into dour drama and schmaltzy romance). Definitely one for the DVD player, not the big screen. (Originally posted at SciFi.com)Staci Layne Wilson"
2,Watchable but overall a poorly done movie,"I wonder if Nicholas Cage knew what he was getting into when he choose to do this movie?This movie really isn't very good at all. The plot is confusing,stupid and totally unbelievable even by comic book standards. The plot holes are big enough to drive a semi through. The special effects were mediocre by today's standards and it looks like some of the actors were just phoneing it in.A pretty poor effort. It rivelas Fantastic 4 for one of the worst super hero movies made in the 21st Century. If you really want to see this movie get it from the library please don't plop down your own money."
3,Ghost Rider Blu-Ray,"I owned this video on DVD and it's somewhat clearer, but not a ""Wow, what a difference"" Love the movie, just not that impressed with the Blu-Ray version."
4,Enjoyed this movie,"I really enjoyed this movie, the special effects were great. Audio is very good on my HD TV without any surround sound at all."
1,Nick Cage as Rider....no thanks,"Pure example of poor casting. Cage has the same role/acting in every film, and this is no exception...yawn..."
2,Thumbs down...Horrible Movie.,Not what we expected....poor acting poor movie in general. Nicolas Cage's career is over. Terrible Flick!
2,"No, Nick not another one. Enough already.","Nick Cage makes alot of movies, about every 4th one is good, the othere three, well that brings us to this one. ""Ghost Rider"" is one of the worst Nick Cage movies I have ever seen, and that is saying alot. The only good thing about this movie is that it has Eva Mendes in it. She is pretty hot. Other then that, dumb plot, bad acting and sorry effects. I would have given it one star, except for Mendes."
2,Great visuals...,"This film had great visuals...unfortunately it is the only great thing about this campy, ridiculous, B-movie on an A-movie budget. Nicolas Cage has wanted this forever, a super hero role. Remember he almost played Superman in the '90's, that would have been even more ridiculous than this. He's far too old to be believable in this role. Had they stuck with the guy playing his character at the beginning, the film would have been much better and more believable. Hopefully this film satisfied his fantasy and he will leave super hero roles alone. I, for one, plan on leaving Nicolas Cage movies alone. He just does one rotten flop after another, and he's always the same dorky, boring guy. Why Hollywood keeps paying him big money to star in expensive films that barely make back their money is beyond me."
1,What A Stinker,"Throughout this whole movie I couldn't decide what I hated most. Was it Nick Cage's bizarre hair? Was it the forced and awkward dialoge? Was it the super heavy reliance on special effects? Was it the complete lack of chemistry between Cage and what's her name? OK, I admit, some of the special FX were cool, but that does not make a good movie. I just hated this movie. Have pity for me, because I saw this train wreck in the theater. Sucks to be me."
1,They should PAY YOU to watch this movie - it's terrible.,"What on earth!?This movie was terrible. If cliches could kill, this movie would bring about the end of humankind. It was entertaining in the fact that it was funny when it didn't mean to be.Poorly written script.Terrible acting.Pretty good special effects.Creative (in a freaky, bizarre, shouldn't-have-done-that sort of way).They should pay Nicolas Cage millions to NOT act."
5,Very COOOOOOOOL,"I really liked this movie! The effects were top notch! It was just overall a little to short. But, still really gooooooooooood!"
4,A Very Different Superhero,"Upon first starting to watch this movie the first thing that may come to mind is that it is cheesy. Then you remember that it is based on a comic book. The over the top acting and the feel is fully intended. It is much along the same feel as of the Spiderman movies. Keeping this in mind you can kick back and enjoy another tale of a superhero, a very different superhero.Johnny Blaze sells his soul to save his father's life. Later in life he is called upon to pay his debt and become the Ghost Rider, but Johnny is not evil and he uses his new found powers for good.The special effects are fantastic. The story is very good (I am not well versed in the original comic book story so this did not take anything away from the movie for me). It was great to see Peter Fonda and Sam Elliot on the screen again; they bring credibility to any movie. This is definitely one to see, and judging by the packed theatre it is going to be huge."
3,It had me interested the whole time,"Normally I really don't like Nicholas Cage movies, but this time I really enjoyed a movie he stared in! I'll be honest, I'm not a hardcore Ghost Rider fan, but this movie has sparked a interest in the comics for me. This movie is really really fun to watch. All the fight sequences are well done and the overall tone of the movie makes you feel like one rad dude! I've never seen the original version, but this director cut was great! The effects are cool and the transformation for when Johnny turns into Ghost Rider is extremely impressive, same goes for his motorcycle. Also, Ghost Rider's voice was f'n awesome! The only things I have a issue with are Blackheart didn't look anything like his comic counterpart and the final fight with him was awful. Blackheart is one of my favorite comic villains and it just kinda sucked to see what became of him in this movie. I don't regret buying this movie, it entertained me and that's all that matters."
4,A fun movie,"It's evil vs. ""kinda evil--ok, working for the devil and doing the devil's bidding even though he killed by daddy but other than that I'm not such a bad guy."" I don't know the comic character, but enjoyed the movie for what it was. Make sure you watch the interview with the teen punk chick who was saved by ghost rider. I can't imagine any bad dreams from this, but it was a fun movie to watch. Your date won't be snuggling up next you out of fear, but you can't have everything. This is one of those movies to watch on DVD with a great sound system and rumbling bass, and bowl of popcorn sprinkled with M&M's. Way to go Nicolas Cage!"
3,Enjoyable,"I have to admit that I don't know much about the Ghost Rider comic books. It was with this that I watched this movie with a open mind. By itself, it's an average thriller - nothing overwhelmingly spectacular (but some of the special effects were sweet) and nothing that's really awful (at least in my opinion) It's not a bad movie to watch on a rainy afternoon or if one's bored, but I recommend you rent 'Ghost Rider' before you buy."
3,It could have been better,"Maybe one of the downfalls I had with this movie is that I hadn't read any of the comics about the Ghostrider, and it didn't provide any significant amount of information for those of us who didn't know. However, I saw the previews and what caught my attention was two things. First, it had Nicholas Cage in it, and I think that he is an awesome actor; no matter what role he is playing. Second, the effects. The way he and his bike turned and changed was awesome.I do, however, feel that this movie had so much more potential than was put to use! It could have been so much better, in my personal opinion. And the ending didn't thrill me all that much, either. I was very disappointed in the way it was chosen to end.But, overall, I thought it was a pretty good movie and I would watch it again because I am a die-hard Nicholas Cage fan."
4,Pretty cool.,"This movie did not suck...unless you know the comic book real well than of course it probably does. As for the effects...amazing!!!! Great CGI! Nicholas Cage, Eva Mendes, and Sam Elliot are pretty good in this film but Peter Fonda's acting is incredibly poor. Truly, Peter Fonda is horrible in this movie. The not so known actors are not so great either. The ending is kinda lame...but it's a verry entertaining movie regardless of these flaws."
2,"Campy, Dumb and Not worth a Sequel","Bottom Line: Other than Eva Mendes' cleavage, this movie was pretty dumb. The dialog was campy and the plot was see through. Seemed like a set up for a sequel; Note to Studio: Don't bother. If the director was going for a cheesy kind of comic book thing, he hit it right on. The problem is that this is a big screen movie - go read the comic book if you are looking for cheese."
3,It was ok...,The movie was not as good as i expected it. It was just... ok. If it wasn't for the special effects the movie would be terrible. I would wait til the price for this movie goes down before buying it.
1,Cheesy,"This was the worst movie I have seen in a long time. If you're buying the DVD, you're lucky that you can turn it off. I had to sit through the horrendous thing in the theater because my husband enjoyed it more than I did, which was just enough to not want to leave. We both love super-hero stories and action films, but this definitely did not live up to my hopes. It's the writing that killed it. It's some of the worst I've ever seen in a major motion picture. Very cheesy. But the acting isn't much better. Eva Mendes is just going through the motions, doing what she can with terrible writing. But Nicholas Cage is way over the the top and, again, cheesy. Additionally, there is no chemistry between the two main characters. There are some cool graphics and lots of Eva Mendes' cleavage (if you're into that), but not much else worthwhile. Save your money and wait to see it on cable ... if you must."
4,From one that does not read comics,"From a person that does not read the comics but watches the movies based on them, I thought it was good. And I'm going to go see it again. The action was awesome. The villians I agree with some people, were deffeted pretty quickly, but I loved it. Nicholas Cage was very funny. I loved it when he changed into Ghost Rider because he'd get this like psychotic crazed look and laugh. It was great.I think they did the best they could with making this movie. You're never really going to get it as perfect as you want it if you read the comic or the book that it's BASED on. Exsample: Harry Potter. People who've read the book feel cheated out of many scenes and characters. People that didn't read the book like it.Just try to think of it this way. It's BASED on the comic, not the comic come to life. Otherwise you may be dissapointed if you are hard core fan of the comic."
2,Worst Comic book adaptation so far,"Ok, I have to admit that I am a sucker for comic book adaptation, and have probably seen all of them. Why is this one so bad? Everything! Bad CGI, poor actor direction (not acting) and the story is SOOO predictible....My suggestion for the producers: recut, revamp some scenes to make them more appropriate for childrens, and re-release the movie with a G rating: kids will love it!"
3,Um...,"This is a terrible movie. So why did I give it three stars?1. ""Ghost Rider"" was my favorite comic as a kid.2. I love motorcycles3. Nicholas Cage is an interesting actorOtherwise... this would be as forgettable as ""The Punisher."""
5,This one delivers...,"This movie looked absolutely amazing on my 60"" Sony DLP tv! You gotta have this one in blu-ray, the colors are great. Yeah, I like the story as well, not gonna win any oscars, but a good story just the same. In contrast, I would say the plot of Ghost Rider is very superior to the coincedence-laden plot of Spiderman III. But the cinematoghraphy is superb, and you can really see it on blu ray. Hope this helps!"
3,Not bad kept me watching.,"I was hoping this would start where the other left off however it was really different from the first. which I thought was much better, the special effects were great but I have seen Nicolas Cage do better."
2,Meh...,"Ghost Rider is... Meh... I didn't really care for it. The acting was sub-par, and I really didn't care for the story too much. I mean I guess it'd seem cool to some, but it didn't appeal much to me... The effects were pretty good in places, so that's a highlight I suppose. But overall, I just didn't really like this movie. -Trent Foreman, Author of Nightmare"
4,Ghost Rider Extended with Limited Gift Set,it's huge box when this stuff has coming. A lot suprises because i don't see dvd. I see a big figure in box and dvd was on sculpture. Why i buy this edition because i like this figure. Picture quality 4/5 and have 2 disc at this edition. of course if you want to compare the blu-ray version of the audio specs are very different. Blu-ray audio is uncompressed audio compared to dvd. If u like this figure u can buy if cheap. but if u like picture and highly audio u can choose blu-ray version
1,TOP 10 WORST OF ALL TIME,"Hard to believe a film could be so bad, but this one is. What and embarrassment for all involved. Nick Cage stoops to a new low and Eva, low cut tops, Mendes has only her breats to offer.it is clear Marvel is only about making money and not art."
2,Not rated? Slow movie.,"slow movie, got boring at times. The no rating was a tough call for our kids, some foul language, not to bad, lots of references to the devil. Could have been a lot better."
1,THE BOX SAYS IT ALL,"The cool picture on the box is the best part of the movie. The story line is a painfully old one about a guy who semi-unwittingly makes a bargain with the devil. The only thing worth watching is the transformation into the ""ghost rider"". To recap, no story, and lean on eye-candy. Doesn't leave much. I'm a huge Marvel fan, but this is just a snoozer. Save your dineros. Go for the X-men instead."
3,This Movie Takes Itself Too Seriously,"This movie is a cross between ""The Devil and Daniel Webster"" and ""Faust"" with a dash of ""Spiderman"" thrown in.Unfortunately, the movie takes itself too seriously. I found myself laughing at scenes that were not meant to be funny."
2,Ugh,"I'm watching the movie on DVD and the jail scene is on, which prompted me to write this review.Totally against national statistics, this holding cell is full of white guys. The proceed to beat-up ""Ghost Rider"". The 1 black kid in the cell is of course the nice one who tries to get them to not beat him up. Go figure. Then of course he turns into the flaming head Ghost Rider and beats all the white dudes up.Totally blew the movie for me.Not only that, but the whole movie is slow. Reminded me alot of Blade... but suckier. It even had Sam Elliot playing the exact same part as in Blade.So unless you want to see a cool flaming Harley, this movie pretty much sucks."
2,A Disappointment,"This movie is an insult to the extraordinary acting abilities of Nicolas Cage. The one forgiving point of the movie was that Eva Mendez was cast, but, not for her exceptional acting abilities either, but for her outstanding Feminine form; her body, not her brains. Why take to Thoroughbreds and make run the ""Mule Racetrack?"" Why take two incredible actors and put them in a movie where their true artistic abilities are not utilized...? This movie is a waste of time, and that's coming from a person who used to be a really big ""Ghost Rider"" fan as a kid. There is a plus to buying this disaster, his movie is excellent as an insomnia remedy...!"
3,Ghost Rider,"In his youth, Johnny Blaze (Cage) made a deal with the Devil (Fonda) . He gave up his sould to the to save his father's life. Years later, as the world's top stuntman, nothing can stop him from the most crazy of stunts. The Devil won't let him die. When Blackheart (Bentley) comes to Earth to take it over, the Devil makes Johnny into Ghost Rider - a flaming skeleton on a bike - and tasks him to defeat Blackheart and his minions.""Ghost Rider"" is clearly on the B-list of Marvel superheroes, and that is evident in the film. That is not necessarily a bad thing, as the movie is enjoyable in its own way. Surprisingly, despite its subject matter, ""Ghost Rider"" does provide a number of lighter moments that contribute to its enjoyment. The actors are all adequate, none a standout. The effects are nicely done. Hollywood has come a long way in animating digital flames. In the end, ""Ghost Rider"" is an entertaining, but forgettable, superhero movie."
5,Lets Ride,Get on Your hellcycle and speed to watch this awesome movie. and it gets better with a limited 3 disc edition. So don't stop for Mcdonalds until you've seen one of Marvels cooliest superheroes on this awesome extended 3 disc dvd. If you have not seen this movie then you should.
3,"Battling that ""old Devil!""","Not quite a classic, this film about good and evil, the Devil on earth and redemption is fun to watch. Nicholas Cage does a good job in this film that mixes some horror with humor. Eva Mendes really can't act, but is in the film to provide some T & A.While not quite a cult classic, based on the Marvel comics works, it will entertain a viewer with some rude scenes and typical bad guys from the underworld getting their just desserts.Fun to watch, especially to see Nicholas Cage as the Ghost Rider."
2,There are better ways to spend 90 minutes!,Ghost Rider has a thin plot and corny dialogue. The movie fails to pull the audience and excite them. the CGI involved is the highlight of the film but not enough to make it a success. Maybe children below 15 years of age might enjoy the movie but anybody looking for real (or not even that real) substance will be let down by this film. Avoid it if possible.
4,"Great Movie, just watch the kids!","Great movie, the person I bought it from was wonderful! I love Nic Cage and Peter Fonda was a treat. Please be careful with young kids, lots of cursing!"
5,Gift for a friend.,He's happy with it! What more can I say other than that? He enjoyed this brand new movie a lot..
2,Dissapointing.,"Considering the amount of heads the release of this movie had turned, my expectations were pretty high. Unfortunately, 'Ghostrider' was more dissapointing than the first 'Spiderman' was.The biggest problem with this movie is that absolutely no time was spent in character development. The story went straight to action way to early, and there was no bond with any of the characters like should be felt in any good movie. This seems to be a huge problem with most movies in recent memory. It seems like the theory today is, if you have good graphics and fight scenes, then substance really doesn't matter.There were a couple of funny parts that saves this from 1 stars, but this was overall just a boring, colorful modern movie built up way too much."

1,Too bad.,"I love Nicolas cage, but this is not his type of movie. He did much better in Face/Off which was some-what comic book like. I didn't sense chemistry between him and Eva the kiss was more like them eating lunch, sloppy and all over the place. I personally don't like Eva, she looks greasy. The villains were no challenge to him, especially the last one. I guess the most powerful is the easiest to kill? I really hope Cage picks better rolls in the future, this and the Wicker Man are killing me."
1,Cool Effects - That's IT!!,"Just a bad movie overall. This film only proves that no matter how many cool effects and tricks you use, it can't possible make up for a shoddy script and horrid acting.Creepshow IIImade more sense than this predictible film. Certainly not Cage's best acting either. But really cool computer effects! Goes to show where all the money went with this film. And the chick was pretty hot too!Just a predictable script with cheesy acting by some barnyard rejects. Too bad Sam Elliot and Peter Fonda (what the hell was he doing here?) didn't have anything better to do than this film. Cage is good, and so is the hot chick. But that's it.A rent if you must but definitely not a buy!"
1,"Terrible move, terrible waste of time and money","Ghost Rider should have been a kick a** movie, instead, it got its own a** kicked, through a poor script, terrible CGI, and bad acting. It's time for a restart on this one, Marvel. Just like the Punisher, Daredevil, Elektra, and Fantastic Four, you should restart these franchises. Whereas with Hulk, there was no need to restart it, but you are -- go figure!"
1,Obiviously,"Obviously I watched a completely different movie then these moron's giving this trash anything more then a star. I feel cheated and pissed off I have to even rate this as a 1 star. This movie was without a doubt one of the worst movies ive seen in quite some time. I knew when Nicholas Cage was cast it was going to be stupid, but even I didnt think he could do this bad!! Nicholas Cage sucks as an actor anyway but this movie was well past god awful.The acting was terrible, the stupid lines were the worst ive seen, ""Have Mercy, Sorry All Out Of Moercy"" WHAT THE FU** kind of stupid shi* is that. That alone made me want to turn it off, but I thought it cant get worse then that, Yeah well It does! This movie has some of the gayest lines you will ever hear in any movie. If you have a lick of sense, take my word and dont waste your time on this dud!NEGATIVE 10 STARS"
1,Great effects little else.,"I was a GR fan growing up so I went in with lowered expectations. Unfortunately even with lowered expectations this ""movie"" disappoints.The script is pretty sub-par even with some pretty poor comic to film translations in the marketplace recently. The acting is worse with the only exception coming even close is Sam Elliot and even his performance was mediocre.The effects are great and really fit well but the poor plot and acting killed what might have been a decent translation."
2,"Fair adaptation, good effects","Motorcycles are cool. Flames are cool. Flaming motorcycles are way cool (but you'll a ride that's even cooler near the end). Pretty ladies are cool, so there's one of them. Fighting bad guys is pretty cool, too.That's about it. Although I haven't read the original comic, this comes across as a movie you can like anyway. But, in the end, it's just a comic, and not one of the best.//wiredweird, reviewing the release to theaters"
3,For Comic book fans,"If you're a fan of this comic book I guess you would enjoy the movie. I only gave it 3 stars because I like Nicolas Cage, and OMG is that Peter Fonda, I love Peter Fonda, ever since Easy Rider. Sam Elliott makes a nice appearance too!"
3,ghost rider,"nicolas cage is a great actor and I would watch him in anything, but next time no more super hero type movies. It's not where he performs his best stuff, but he's still the man."
4,Wow...,I never saw Nicholas Cage as a comic book character! Hmm...if it was for the fake hair he might have impressed me! The movie is good. One man's quest to the best turns into a nightmare that only he can fix. He has to defeat the devil's son so he can defeat the devil. Eva Mendes heard it was a comic book made movie so she left her acting skills at the door. Other than that it was pretty good entertainment.
2,Wait for the DVD,"Overall, Ghost Rider was a waste of two hours. Nothing memorable other than Eva Mendes and her cleavage. Nic Cage was decent, but didn't seem to be trying that hard. The CGI was better than the trailers would lead you to believe, but it was nothing I haven't seen done better before. The worst part of the film was the villians and how easy they were defeated. This isn't the worst comic book adaptation, but it deserves a spot somewhere on that list. Wait for the DVD!"
2,"Ghost ""NOT"" Rider","If you are having trouble getting to sleep, then watch this sorry movie and you will be right asleep!!!"
4,Good.,"This is a grat book because it is multidiciplinary, but maybe content wise, it is not very original-nor focused in consciousness. There are papers dealing with squitzofrenia and ageing. Greenfield contribution presents her neuronal assemblie theory. Rose writes a great introduction to consciousness studies, and it alone pays for the entrance ticket. It is always interesting to read about Aleksanders work on artificial consciousness, and Penrose on Quantum Consciousness. The collection as a whole covers many topics, and it is a valuable contribution to consciousness studies. It is also not at all technical, so it can serve as an introductory work of the field. Again, originality and content do will not live to many expectations, but I certialy recomend the book."
3,An Uneven Collection of Papers,"Steven Rose compiled an uneven collection of papers. Some of his allusions to Soma seem misplaced when contrasted with Crow's biological psychiatry (article on Schizophrenia). Another article claims that schizophrenia is not an identifiable medical condition. Schizophrenia is a useful label for a complex constellation of symptoms. They share at least one characteristic: disordered thinking. I am reminded of Oliver Sacks' book, Migraine. When originally written, Sacks dispaired that a single, unified cause would be discovered. In a revision ten years later, Sacks discussed the discovery of a single cause, the nucleus trigeminalis, in the brain stem. Some of the articles are out of place; for example, discussion of computers and artificial intelligence. Several of the articles are excellent but do not offset the more peculiar articles."
2,Not very durable,"The chain broke thr first week hr wore it, yhe one that he had before I bought this one he wore for about six years without any problems. Not badly made, but not very sturdy, Fast shipper."
4,Good Album,"I like the songs on this album. ""Let Me Sleep Beside You"" is an interesting 60's style rock and roll romp with great guitar riffs and eclectic lyrics. There are some folk-like aspirations throughout, but that was typical of 60's british rock. This album represents what is different from most of Bowie's work. Even his singing is different. His voice is raw and hasn't developed any of the distinct Bowie lilts as in his later 70's and 80's work. This would be a nice change of pace for someone who is accostomed to 80's Bowie. It's worth the time to take to listen to."
4,Solid,This panel is old school. It's getting harder and harder to find them like this. I got this so my family has no questions as to whether the circuit is off or on. It's built tough too. Can't think of anything bad to say about it. Good value.
1,misguided idea,"This product looks to be a good idea but has a major flaw. This is a one time use item since it can't be taken apart to be cleaned.So I think it is overpriced for that experience and borders on being a moneymaking gimmick. Would not buy again, I feel it is a waste of money."
5,Great Buy!!,"This watch is a steal. Its has a very slim gold color case and the size is just right for me (although I have a small wrist), the dial is easy to read and the brown leather strap is just perfect. It is a very elegant and classy watch. I'm very happy with it."
1,"Good Price, So-So Watch","I was looking for an everyday watch that specifically had a brown leather band. When I found this Seiko watch for under $50-it seemed like a great buy. But when I received the watch, it was less than met the eye. The whole watchface is shiny gold-including the hands and its not easy to read. But my main criticism is the band--its a muddy color orange-y brown and its very thick--actually it looks more like a man's watch than a woman's. Did I love it-no. Did I keep it-yes. Like I said before, it was under $50..."
2,Julian Marsh goes way to stereotypical with the selection here,"Way too happy for my tastes, this collection sounds like stuff you'd have heard on Fire Island during a weekday afternoon tea dance in Cherry Grove in the mid-90s. It's a mix of cheesy soft house and bad cover versions, including journey's ""Don't Stop Believin,"" Anything Box's ""Living in Oblivion,"" Roxy Music's ""More Than This,"" and Stephanie Mills's ""Never Knew Love Like this before."" The strongest tracks on here are Nikki French's cover of Celine Dion, and Lovefreekz sample of ELO. I prefer Julian's mixes with more trance. Track times are:1. I'll Rise (6:00)2. Shine On (4:25)3. Shine (4:25)4. I Believe in You (5:22)5. Breathe (5:27)6. Living in Oblivion (5:30)7. I Surrender (5:50)8. Don't Stop believin (5:03)9. California (4:32)10. There's a whole lot of loving (4:37)11. Life (6:25)12. Teardrops (5:39)13. more than this (6:09)14. never knew love like this before (5:45)"
5,Nice map,"Good map,don't use it when you're lost and need detailed directions,but it gives good overview of the Grand Canyon and the hiking routes there."
5,Good-but you need some geo-hiking ability to read,"This is an extremely detailed map. Perhaps even more helpful than GPS (in fact, I think it is recommended to not rely on GPS in remote areas). I have never used a map that uses this unique geo-coding. It was actually fun learning (I suppose the military uses similar mapping systems. So you have to orient yourself to using the unique spatial features called out on the map. But is extremely helpful."
5,Great!,"Fit well over my glasses, really take care of the sun and glare. I recommend these glasses to people who wear glasses regluarly."
5,Convenience,"This product works as intended and does it flawlessly. It has a simple purpose and that is to charge your mini-dv batteries in a wall outlet. This is a much easier way to charge camera batteries and provides the extra convenience and benefit of ebing able to charge up an additional battery while filming with your other battery (assuming you have two, of course)."
5,Fast charger!,"This charger will charge batteries for you camera very quickly. It's very small and the wall prongs that you plug into the wall fold into the body for easy storage. it has a small yellow LED the turns off when the battery is fully charged so you can easily tell. much better than using the camera itself to charge the battery, and a whole lot faster. Great buy."
5,Convenient,This prodecut is small and the plug folds in. which makes it easy to travel with. I used it on may vacation this week. It was small with out long wires and easy to pack.Ms. Budhoo
4,This is the only one to use.,"The is the best, do not buy anything else. It works far better than others."
5,Sony Quality the Best,Great charging and fast too. You can't go wrong with the ease and convenience of this product.
5,sony battery charger,"if you have the m serie battery in your sony equipment you will enjoy having this charger, it eliminates the hanging cords or charging in the camera."
3,Sony only,"This works fine for Sony battaries, but for some unknown reason, won't charge other over the counter battaries for the same camera. Disappointing in that respect."
5,sony products,easy to use. dont have to carry bulky ac adaptor any more. should have bought it sooner.
4,Have Batteries will travel....,"great little charger... no longer need to carry around the brick to charge battereis... and off camera, so that's not tied up to do the charging..."
4,Very pretty and well made,"Amethysts are clear (but not a fake looking clear), and the earrings are well made."
3,Not quite how I remembered it...,"...but I probably will buy the DvD when it gets released. I'll make myself short; ""Razorback"" for its' time is more a one-of-a-kind-movie than it is a classic, if you know what I mean? BUT, it is original, different. And rather interesting, actually. Not many movies have been made about these animals, and just the idea of making a horror-movie called ""Razorback"" is rather brave. I mean; a giant killer-pig! And at times the movie is a bit scary. All thanks to the fabolous camera-work, the sound and ""the Beast"" itself.First time I saw ""Razorback"" I was 14 years old, and it really facinated me -and I never quite got it out of my mind. I find it strange that it is not yet released on DvD considering all the garbage out on the market today, it is a good movie. And I saw it on tv here the other day, and it was a ""reunion"" worth waiting for -though not quite the movie I remembered."
3,Razorback,"The most accurate review of this movie was written by TV guide many years ago and I still remember it today.It stated,""The best movie ever made about a giant, man-eating pig.""It's pretty good and it's pretty bad, but it's worth a taste if only to see if it appeals to yours. Now how about a widescreen DVD version so we can truly appreciate the films best point - its cinematography - without all those distracting pans and scans."
1,Disappointment,"We were very disappointed with the product. It wouldn't play due to region code.Even it stated for all regions, it still wouldn't play on the DVD player. I wished I knew more about regions codes before I purchased it. I am new to buying DVD's over the internet. I also wished it were priced under $10.00."
5,The razorback was really cool,I think this movie was like grizzly the giant pig was really cool and I think that the pig should have fought some monsters like a sasquatch or a yeti. that would have been really cool.
4,Art Class: A COMPLETE guide for any ability,"I recently bouth this book on the advice of a friend and long time painter. AS a beginner I didn't even kow what to buy, much less where to begin.After reading this book cover to cover several times. It gave me the confidence to get started.With easy step by step instructions it helped me as a beginner get a really good foundation down.Now I feel free and confident enought to tackel harder and harder mediums.I LOVED IT"
4,Reminds me of MORPHINE ... especially the Sax,"reminiscent of MORPHINEdark & deepgreat on ""Shot Shot"""
4,Excellent!!! and a little different from their previous ones,Excellent!! I feel more experimental than their previous albums but truly gomez style.
3,Over-produced,"On first listening this album was disappointing, but it rewards further listening. Compared to the brilliant Liquid Skin, there is too much electronica for my liking. Stand-out tracks include Shot Shot, In Our Gun, Ping One Down and Drench, but all too often other potentially good tracks get lost in a deluge of zx spectrum beeps and whines. The Ballad of Nice and Easy is not a patch on the previous sign-off tracks Rie's Wagon and Devil Will Ride. I hope for a return to a more acoustic sound in their next album."
4,Great album...,Every time I play this album I ask myself why I don't play it more often. It has a nice balance of tracks that really rock and others that let you chill a bit. I think it is one of Gomez's strongest albums.
4,Solid Gomez album,"I really like Gomez. The howl that is so viseral and the blend of classic southern rock with a modern Radiohead touch playing and production make them one I my favorite rock bands. More roots than the Mother Hips, who I love as well, they are in the vein of Pearl Jam and great West-Coast groups. That said, this album is a good example of them at their best I think. I first got Liquad Skin and was left not really that happy. It was more Alice in Chains than I wanted and knew Gomez to be. So when I put this one, I said was like, ""Ah that is what I wanted."" Then I put the other on a week or so later and was no longer jonesin' for more and enjoyed them both."
4,A TRUE CLASSIC,"Oh Yeah. This one has gotta go down in the annals of musichistory as one of the greatest discs ever. Exaggeration? -Maybe, But it was my favorite disc of 2002. In a time of overor under done music this band is delivering a truly innovativesound that captures a quality that's lacking in todays music.It's obvious from the first track that each and every bandmember is talented. These guys are true musicians. Their talentis reminiscent of The Cult or Janes Addiction. This band is tight! Can't wait to hear what's next. An expanded American tour would be nice."
2,"A cute set, but be aware of a few things","Length:: 2:36 MinsThis tea set is decent enough, as long as you realise how tiny it is and that the decorations are applied stickers."
1,One of the worst books I've ever read,"The dialog is stilted, the characters boring, their relationship emotionless and it falls apart leaving the reader wondering why they ever bought this book. How it ever won an award is beyond me. I ended up skipping pages, but even that didn't help, so I just threw it away. If I could give it a zero I would."
2,Blah,"Boring, pointless, and badly writen. The characters were stale slices of Wonder Bread and the plot went nowhere and took a long time to get there. I wanted to like this book, but there was nothing there to like."
5,The best contemporary vampire novel I've read in a decade,"The situation where Brandy is called to investigate a body in the faculty offices of the local university starts getting screwy almost from the start. Why is a young man's chair occupied by the body of someone dead of extreme old age?Then, too, why is Dan Martin taking such an interest in the investigation?And what part do Doc and his ex-con son have in the situation?Then Brandy's best friend is found murdered, with fang-marks in her neck. Now it's personal!"
2,A disappointment,"The story was okay. I didn't find the characters that interesting or appealing -- at least, not enough to buy a sequel if there is one. It's so obvious who the villain is. And, frankly, I like my romances a lot steamier. The best we get here is the first delicious kiss that Dan gave Brandy. Everything after that was just bland. I DO have to agree with one reader, though. The cover is so misleading. Who is that vamp on the cover? It certainly isn't Dan Martin who was described as having black eyes and black hair. Black hair? Isn't that a [very unappealing] blonde on the cover? And was that supposed to be a werewolf in the corner? There was no werewolf in the book. One more thing; I thought the last terror scene would never end. Good grief, was THAT ever dragged out. I kept hoping the book would get better. I would recommend any of The Southern Vampire Series books INSTEAD of this."
1,Not worth the money,The concept is good but there are no instructions to apply and the unit rips or tears easily.
4,City Folk Runs Amok in the Rural Countryside...,"It takes a while to get into the story as the style of writing is wordy and dense. The authors favors lengthy description of minute details which I felt was wholly unnecessary and tedious. Leaves you wondering why can't the author just can't get into the crux of the story.Otherwise, a good take on tackling romance about a hip girl in a highly demanding PR job meets once-upon-a-time investment banker turned organic farmer set against the current agricultural reforms taking place in England.The author takes a dig at the save the wildlife movement pitched against the more mundane bread and butter issues of farmers in rural Suffolk trying hard to survive against the ever evolving British agricultural mishaps that happened in the past and present.The subtle humour surfaces when the city folk thought that they had landed in a country hotel for a long weekend away from London but turned out otherwise and that's where the fun starts!"
5,Definitely worth viewing!,"My boyfriend insisted that I watch this movie and it's easy to see why: ""The Lives of Others"" is a compelling and thought provoking movie about one man living vicariously through the lives of the people he's supposed to be watching. The film shows his evolution from a top ranking Stazi investigator to a compassionate man who loses everything because he learned sympathy and respect for others.The movie is interesting not only for the easy relation to what's happening in the US with privacy concerns today but also for what such scrutiny does to people psychologically (both for those watching and those being watched).The only stumbling block is the language barrier. If you have the patience for subtitles though, it's well worth watching!"
5,Beautifully done,I almost turned this off 30 minutes in - I'm so glad I didn't give up! I wish I saw this when it was in the theater; it's a wonderfully made film and the end is incredibly moving. The acting is all first-rate.
5,Amazing!!!,"Really brilliant! I enjoyed this movie tremendously! Beautiful mise-en-scene back at the apartment, wonderfully acted. Very stylish and extremely current to the world that we live in!!!"
5,"Decent translation / dubbing, good topic","The Staatssicherheit (Stasi) secret police played a HUGE role in the lives of many people in the former GDR (East Germany), controlling every aspect of their lives. Artists, writers and other ""intellectuals"" were under strict surveillance and often their friends and lovers were involved in the spying. The film is a good look at how the system worked and how one man had a change of heart.I saw the German version and wanted my mother to be able to see the film, hence the English-language edition."
4,Pleasantly Surprised,"This movie was one of many foreign films that I ordered, and I was happy that I did. I guess many countries have their own 'McCarthy' moments in history. Not until the very end did I realize why this movie won an Oscar."
3,The Lives of Others,"This is not exactly what I am expecting in this movie. Best acting can be considered to the actor, but the story is not suspense as I thought. jose'"
4,Learning Tool,"A very interesting insight into the Cold War. Probably used as a training film for the Bush administration. Definitely an excellent movie especially if it inspires you to sweep your home for ""bugs"" and scramble all your phone connections. The price of freedom is truly eternal vigilance. The surest way to have something happen to you is to watch something happen to someone else and assume it could never happen to you."
3,Have patience,"When the gray men controlled the GDR, they knew or thought they knew everything. Why would one gray man give his subjects a break? That is never answered satisfactorily, but the quiet story is nevertheless powerful. well acted and fascinating."
2,Hard Work,Selective sub-titles drove me mad. I wanted to enjoy this after all the hype but afraid it just didn't do it for me. I have no criticism of the acting but there was a huge communication gap and it merely drove me to sleep.
2,"Very slow, but through provoking....","A German language movie with English subtitles, it's very slow, and I found myself fast forwarding thru much of it. It does show a very disturbing picture of life in the GDR just before the wall came down with Artists being monitored by the Stazi."
2,Viewing for Specialists...,"Maybe, simplistic English subtitles following a repeatedly-boring stills of story presenting a special services officer job-spaying over co-citizens, make a viewer even more asleep than just watching average images of characters hungry for copulating.Well, what all this fuss about Oscar et al? A Stasi employer is shown as a citizen bored to tamper with dirty clothes of others?At the end of the day, no call-girl services were available in Honneker Germany."
5,Sure to be an all-time classic,"This is simply a superb piece of film-making: a memorable plot, believable dialogue, touching, tense, and first-class acting, particularly from Ulrich Muhe, who (sad to say) passed away recently. His performance deserves to be ranked among the very best ever."
5,Beautifully Emotional,"What a wonderful film! Direction is so precise; the story takes surprise turns, and the ending makes you cry. I did not believe this movie would affect me this much. Moreover, art direction is superb. Characters are portrayed as REAL people, by gifted actors. I liked the language being German with subtitles. German movies with actors speaking English are totally phony. I'm glad Hollywood didn't make this film."
5,Well done,I came across this at a back room theater that showed foreign and independent film. This is the best film I saw there. I loved the relationship that developed between the characters and their personal growth. I was quite happy with this one.
5,Powerful movie,The story is extremely interesting. A writer is selected like so many to be investigated were because he has run against a high party official who wants his girlfriend. While under investigation he turns out that he is engaging in some subversive activities. It is at this point to me the story started to seem unbelievable that a secret policeman in Eastern Germany would get so involved with this writer and his girlfriend that he would cover up for him and that he could as it is not like those secret policeman were trusted by the state either. They had people looking over them too. Still it is a movie.The characters are well developed and come across well. I particularly liked the suicide scene. The acting is good.The filming is good enough.
5,A glimpse into another time and world,"This film expertly illustrates what it was like in 1980s East Germany, when many citizens' homes were under constant surveillance for any hint of sedition or suspicious activity. Arousing too much suspicion brought a visit from the Stasi and months of interrogation and imprisonment, often followed by despair and suicide.We follow the lives of a small group of writers and actors as they try to produce plays that someone might disapprove of. What's more interesting is that one of the Stasi monitors is sympathetic to these artists and ends up protecting them at his own professional expense.An especially frightening thought: with illegal wiretapping and surveillance, we run the risk of ending up in exactly this sort of society, under the guise of ""security"" and ""protection."""
5,Stasi Life,"'The Lives of Others' deserved its foreign-language Oscar.The acting and plot were well integrated, and the overalltheme of the violation of privacy was gripping. The writer-director's commentary on the DVD was engrossing."
5,Whoa Much better than I thought!,"The subject matter is not bunnies and puppies. It can be quite depressing seeing what totalitarian commie government [and Republican] can do to a people. But this movie has its smiles and wait until you see the ending. I don't want to give anything away, so I'll just say that the movie will not leave you depressed. It was much better than I expected. I had to give it 5 stars. We hav vays to make u smile"
4,For those that never knew...,"I have rejected all my life the utilization of art to justify political ideologies and some people could see ""The Life of Others"" as a right wing pamphlet (specially those that still believe in the re-birth of socialism, Soviet style)...But this movie goes beyond the political implication to present the moral dilema of a basically decent human beingfaced with the demands of his job as a represive agent of a totalitarian government...(and this could be ""any"" government or any entity that demands blind loyalty)...It is a very good movie that sails against the ignorance of our youth and the indiference of the majorities...You could dismiss the political implications but I hope that the moral question will remain with you for a long time...!"
5,So real and so moving. What tyrannical political systems can do to people's lives,"The film is excellent regarding the direction, the acting and the story and presents the corrupted East German state in all its viciousness and paranoia just a few years before it fell crushing down. A Stasi captain who is regarded an exemplary officer in his service undertakes a mission which will bring him face to face with his innermost fears and doubts. He is the hand of God personified in that police state, but he chooses to fight his inner and very personal war regardless of the cost. The tragic finale is very moving, as is also the way that director Dreyman chooses to express his gratitude to his improbable benefactor."
4,The Lives of Others,I have shown this movie to friends who were very impressed and said that they understood the lives of those behind the Iron Curtain much better.
5,The best movie ever made.,"Lives of Others is an extremely moving film. The integrity of the writers, producer, actors and composer are beyond what I ever saw. The honesty, the sense of reality, the humanity and in general the treatment of such a, still actual , problem for the Germans is overwhelming.Made on a low budget. So far removed from ""Hollywood"" I am sure many people will not be able to relate to it. It's their loss.For those who do this movie will be of enormous emotional impact and it stayed with me for weeks. Mind you, one should see it at least twice and also view the comments of the artists involved in order to get the full picture.At the level of 'Sophie Schol' and ""Kolya"". See it!"
4,How gorgeous is this story??,"When I first started watching this movie, I thought I was in for a polemic rave about the Communist regime in East Germany....which it is to an extent. But it is so much more.A man employed by the Stazi police in EGermany sets up a listening post near the apartment of a left wing playwrite and his lover. He ""spies""on them by listening in through the multiple microphones implanted in the apartment.Along the way, he somehow gets involved in their lives and starts trying to influence or manipulate the outcome of the story. I don't want to spoil the ending, so I won't say more about it, except to say it is both tragic and beautiful.I was extremely moved by this movie. It bears watching again in order to savour each scene."
5,"Yep. This is it. Human natures good, bad, and ugly","Beyond the spy theme, and it is as realistic as it gets, the portraits of human natures are profound yet clearly spoken. Ute's symbolism is great.Oh! The extras on this disk are weak. Blathering author speaking about the actors and acting is sickening. The movie is five stars."
5,Brilliant film,It is hard for us to conceive of such control when living in a place like New Zealand and to think that this story took place in recent times is just mind-blowing. Superb acting and spell-binding.
2,Mediocre,"I found the plot corny and unexceptional. Eyeball rolling moments include the cliched accident in the road and the Stasi guy listening to the music. Didn't believe his character or much else. It is sentimental melodramatic claptrap designed to push buttons in people to produce waterworks, rather than serious thinking. On the plus side there is some nice period detail (although I have no idea how accurate) and photography.There is the possible perception that an arthouse-like poster and promise of subtitles will mean superior fare, but there is a lot of junk out there, period. Worth a rental maybe as it is not totally without merit."
1,"Subtitles Spanish, French and English?","If I could give this less than 1 star I would.Considering that German is one of the most spoken languages in the world, in this country and in some states it is the second most spoken language after English, why wouldn't they have German subtitles?This is the reson why I WILL NEVER buy blue ray products!"
1,Just kidding!,"The other reviews do not lie, this is one of the best films to be released anywhere in the world in the past 5 years. Great script, Deutschland's finest actors, inventive camera work. A bit on the Romantic side (in the German sense), so if that's not your aesthetic cup of tea, this will be a taxing viewing; otherwise its hard to imagine being disappointed!"
2,Boring,"I don't care how many foreign awards this movie got, it's boring. Really boring. Save your money."
1,"If you don't speak Gernan, forget it!","I rented the film, with much anticipation. After a few minutes of viewing, I realized that there was no way to understand what was going on due to the offensive way Sony has subtitled the movie. One word every minute, with no particular criteria. So, if you don't speak German, save yourself a big frustration. I can see films in Spanish, French, Italian and English. But German, unfortunately, no. I will wait for a new edition, possibly Criterion.Carlo Chiarenza"
1,snoozer,"after reading the reviews on this movie, i was really looking forward to it. yes, i heard the first 90 minutes could be slow, but you had to stick with it, blah, blah. let me tell you, this movie was an absolute disappointment from start to finish. i almost turned it off, but stuck it out. i regret that i did.sorry, but this movie was a bore, plain and simple. the only benefit i got from this movie was the fact it was in german, so i learned how to say 'bad movie' in another language....""Schlechten Film!"" - ok, i got that from google translator, but you get my point.don't say you haven't been warned! there's plenty more you can do with 2+ hrs of your life than sit through this snoozer while you check your watch (and pulse) every 10 minutes, hoping it will just plain end.remember, 'shclechten film!'"
5,"FLORIAN HENCKEL VON DONNERSMARCK, OPUS 1","***** 2006. Written and directed by Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck. Academy award in the Best Foreign Language Film of the Year category and three European Film awards (Best film, Screenwriter and Actor). East Germany, 1984. A member of the Stasi spies on a small group of artists and secretly intervene in their lives. You can store this DVD in your library just next to your copy of Francis Ford Coppola'sThe Conversation. Masterpiece."
2,Tenor Sax,"When I first received this item, the octave key was a jammed, which could have happened during shipping, so I exchanged it for another, when I received the replacement 2 of the keys leaked."
5,A Must for Your Business Library,"A lucid, light read that offers powerful insights. This book is a must for the business or marketing person's reference library. Thoroughly enjoyed it!"
3,"Ok, but not what I expected.",I expected a lot more from this book. There are hardly any new spreads or any really value information for forming them that any practitioner does not already know. If you are a beginner... it may be helpful but otherwise don't waste your money.
4,I cried like a baby watching it,"It is a very simple story, no Hollywood-style big band, ect, but it is very touching."
5,A well-reasoned argument,"This was a hard-nosed analysis of Naipaul's work as a whole. Without being overly jargonistic or heavily literary it managed to show the links between different phases of Naipaul's development, and give a sense of the overall development of Naipaul's thinking. It is not a pretty picture, and one that many of Naipaul's admirers will find objectionable. But the argument is persuasive and cannot be dismissed lightly. It is also valuable in providing the context for Naipaul's many books, which are often set in vastly different countries and cultures."
4,Attractive & Easy to Use,"This pickholder is very convenient, easy to use, and it looks attractive anywhere on the guitar. It holds around 8 picks, but you can squeeze 9. The only drawback is that once you place it, it is final. I wish that it could be moved after placement."
2,warning!,"It gets the job done, but if you (obviously) have it stuck to your guitar, and you pull a pick out too quickly (like at the speed of a turtle) you spray your audience/room with picksi recommend spraying a little bit of dry-lube in between each pick when putting new-ones in the holder"
2,does not work well,"not that good, only fits some picks that i have, though all are the standard shape picks, doesn't work that well"
1,Didn't get the job done,"I bought this for my husband as a stocking stuffer..thought it would be something good for him since he is always losing picks. But turns out, it's not good because it falls apart when you try to put picks in it. We only tried putting 3 picks in it and the back came off. You can put it back together but when you try to put picks in it again it just comes apart. Maybe they could make it so the back doesn't come off. It's a good thing to have but just needs to be made better so it will hold the picks without coming apart."
3,"5 stars for normal size picks, but 1 star for jazz picks","I own three of these, and have them attached to the back of my headstocks. Great idea, great concept and great quality. Only problem is that they do not work with the smaller picks that I have recently adopted. Dunlop Jazz III, the Dunlop Max-Grip Jazz IIIs and my Dava Jazz picks just won't stay in there without slipping out.For regular sized picks, it's a perfect product. For smaller sized picks I improvise by using SD card cases -- perfect fit for jazz picks."
3,Hmmmmmm....,"I'm rather disappointed with this item as I put only FOUR (4) picks into it when it snapped apart. I use the Dunlop Tortex 1.0 mm picks and perhaps that's where I was at fault - I maybe should left it at three picks.However, my bench vise and some superglue have remedied the situation nicely. Thus beware of how many picks and their gauge BEFORE you push them into this holder.I give it 3 out of 5 stars for reasons stated."
3,Just make sure you understand what you are getting,"The pick holder is great for holding several picks and very easily allowing you to gain access to the next one in the holder. I'm not a fan of the adhesive that you have to use to keep this on your guitar. As long as you know that is how it adheres to your setup then it will be fine, but I should have read more in depth before purchasing this. This is just personal preference, but I would have preferred that it have a clip to attach it to my guitar strap. I will now be looking to find one that does."
3,It's Fine - Nothing Special,"The Ergo pickholder holds about 6 - 8 picks in a plastic shell. The picks are springloaded from the back so a new one always pops up for you. It's more convenient than having picks lie all over the place, but I found it difficult to get picks out of it quickly, particularly when I'm using Dunlop MaxGrips which have raised texture to them. Also, the ability to stick the pickholder on something is simply an adhesive pad - nothing sophisticated or reusable. Now, raise your hand if you're willing to sticky-tack your pickholder to your guitar or other gear. . . Exactly. As I said, if you need something to hold all of your spare picks in one place (and you're just too high-brow for a plastic baggie), the Ergo is fine."
3,it's ok.,"I quess this pic holder may be a pretty good idea but just not something I would use but as I said, It's ok."
3,It's just that...OK,"Wish this Pickholder held a few more picks! They can also be at times a little hard to get out of the Holder. For the Price, it is ""OK."""
4,Convenient,"Protects and organizes you picks and even gives you a free pick!Can't hold that many though, only about 6 or 7."
3,Ehhh...,"its ok...... it did not hold as much picks as i would of wanted it to... it only holds like 5... however, its not a bad price for a little less than two dollars.... i am sadly disappointed though :/"
3,Tiene mejor imagen que uso,"Compre una docena de uñas Dunlop de 1mm y bueno con este articulo pense que podia llevarlas todas sin problemas. Mi sorpresa es que solamente pudieron entrar a duras penas 4 uñas, el resto me las meti por el.... bolsillo.Tuve que quitar el tope que trae el Pickholder para que entraran 6 uñas pero asi bien prensaditas...Lo que me molesta es el hecho que compre uñas Dunlop con el Pickholder Dunlop y se ve que no hay mucha compatibilidad ya que las uñas son casi que muy grandes y no caben. Pero igual es X, puedes darte el lujo"
5,nice,"I got this for my son so he could hold his picks and keep them in place, he's got it on his guitar stem, it is really easy for him to grab a pick and they stay in place, he has no worry's about them falling out as he is playing, great price, (except for shipping price), would tell anyone who needs something to keep they're picks in to get one of these"
4,Pretty Nice,"Good Things:Good QualityPortableBad Things:Only holds 6 picks (not that bad, but you know)Neutral Things:Sticky thing on back that when you peel it sticks to things"
4,great little pickholder,Was a gift for son. He thought it was great because he was always trying to locate his picks. This takes care of the problem as long as he uses it.
4,Best one I've stumbled across in my 45 years of guitar playing.,"Very nice, smooth, no sharp edges, not much bigger than the picks it's holding (it holds about 10 of my favorite thin Mel Bay picks) ... the only issue is, the spring clip that pushes the picks to the top, is a little too strong, and was warping my thin picks, but I just put one very stiff pick at the bottom of the pile, and it's fine."
4,Nifty Little Pick Holder,"This holder was exactly what I thought I was getting when I ordered it. It's just big enough for several picks, and can be attached to your guitar. Nothin' fancy, but just right for what I wanted !!"
5,Great Product for A Little Price,Purchased this for my nephew who recently picked up acoustic guitar. He attached it to the quitar and was able to house about 6 picks in it. He says he always has one handy now and doesn't have to dig around to find one. Definate smart idea.
1,Terrible,Product brock the same day I took it out of the box. Very cheap make. I love the picks though.
2,buy with caution,"I would be very careful where you PUT this pick holder. I put it a few inches and to the left of my strap...kindof a high traffic area, so it broke off within a few months. There is a strong adhesive on the back, but the screws holding the pickholder to the base are weak and will break. Reccomend putting it in a low traffic area; eg. front of guitar, the top... also, only holds about 6 picks."
3,it works,"Here are some features mentioned in the description:Heavy WallSize - 22 x 29 x 60mmBright Resonant ToneComfortable WeightAfter looking at it, there is nothing heavy about it, in fact it is as thin as one can make.Size? Who cares, but it barely holds 10 medium picks, and actually for the size it should fit a dozen.What resonant tone are we talking about?Weight is light, maybe an ounce. It has a little metal plate as a spring, and I had to squeeze it a little to fit couple more picks.Took forever to get it, came in a huge yellow envelope, which made me suspicious about the item inside."
3,Not purple,"In my humble opinion, the pictures make the product look purple. They're not purple. At least the ones I was sent. They were charcoal.I bought them specifically to use with my daughter's purple Washburn guitar, so it's kind of annoying.Other than the color, there's nothing wrong with them."
2,ok,"this is ok, but please note it does NOT come with any picks! This may seem obvious to most people but the images show picks inside, so I assumed they came too! Apart from that it is fine."
3,Doesn't hold Planet Waves delrins well,"It didn't seem like slight difference in shape would make it almost useless. It may work well with Dunlop picks but not for thePlanet Waves 10 Standard Guitar Picks - Duralin Blue ###GT!!! Medium/Heavy, also the thicker the pick, the fewer it will hold. It has sticky back foam tape on it for mounting to a surface like your amp or whatnot. I've found it mostly not useful thus far, maybe it would help more when playing live so I can grab for a pick and know they will be there."
3,i got both of them for xmas,I GOT BOTH OF THEM FOR OTHER PEOPLE I WILL HAVE TO GET BACK WITH U ON IT HOPE YALL HADE A GOOD DAY
2,still waiting,ive been waiting for over a month for this little piece of plastic ou couldve sent it in the mail in a standard envolope and i wouldve gotten it way before this! im very disappionted with how long this is taking!
5,Cheap and useful!,"Great little pick with an adhesive strip on the back. I bought two, one for my guitar- placed near my volume and tone knobs so i can grab one quickly if i break one. Another on the side of my amp for backup storage.Overall, a great guitar accessory for a small amount of money.Only con is that it doesn't fit many of the odd shaped picks..."
3,Meh,"Bought this so that I could get free shipping on an order. I play guitar so I figured it would come in handy, but I use jazz picks and they don't really sit in here as well as I hoped they would. The way it sits on my headstock makes it hard to grab the picks too. I want to take it off so I can readjust it but it's a one-time application, so that's kind of a downer."
5,Stays on my guitar,"I have a black composite acoustic guitar and this little pickholder stays stuck right where the neck meets the body. People watching me can't really see it, and it's right where I need it, full of picks, if I drop one. Wonderful little invention. Buy it, if you don't want to carry a mess of picks in your guitar case or pocket."
4,Does the job,Spring mechanism works fine and holds a decent number of picks (sorry was gifted to a friend so don't recall exact no). Rounded ergonomic corners are a nice touch. Can't complain for the price
2,pickholder,"this thing is small and only holds smooth plastic picks well. i use dunlop nylon maxgrip picks. they hold, but the grips make it harder to take out, especially with more than one in there. on top of that, this only holds about 5 picks. i was hoping it would hold 6-7."
1,"Poor design, cheaply made","Picks are difficult to get in and out of the holder, and mine broke within 20 minutes of use. Avoid this product"
2,Bad Print Job,"I bought this based on other great works by Fr. Benson, but have not read it yet. The low rating is due to the poor print quality. It looks like a manuscript that has been typed and bound, even the print is not really dark enough to read comfortably.If possible, I would look for a copy by another publisher or find a used copy at Alibris.com."
4,An important poetic voice from Honduras,"""Poems by Roberto Sosa"" is a fine collection by an important writer from Honduras. The poems have been translated into English by Edward V. Coughlin. The book is presented in bilingual format, with the Spanish originals and English versions on facing pages.Sosa's work shows great compassion for the poor and oppressed, especially in poems like ""The Poor,"" ""Three Shadows Reversed in the Mirror,"" ""The People,"" and others. His language is frequently direct and uncluttered, and sometimes surreal and cryptic. He often uses striking images, such as the following: ""May there be children who have toys, / bread / and stars under their shoes"" (from ""The City of the Beggar Children"").Sosa's voice can be prophetic (see, for example, ""Testimonies""), and can evoke the style of Walt Whitman (""The Grass Cut by the Peasants""). This is an important volume for those interested in Latin American poetry."
5,wonderful,"This book truly works at the essence of what it means to be human, the idea the sentience can be seen as the ability to laugh may seem at times to be a stretch it is argued in such a effortless care-free manner that one is drawn to share the authors conclusions.Not light reading but well worth the time and effort."
4,love it 1980s baby,i love this show first heard about it in the 1990s never knew that they did a newer version well it worked for three years why wasnt mabel king in the new one i gonna buy this dvd .
1,Don't waste your money!!,"In my opinion, the first two seasons of what's happening were absolutely great, the third season of what's happening was just plain boring. I think once, Mabel king left the show, it all went down hill. Now as far as what's happening now season 1.. it was snore fest city for me. I mean, I literally fell asleep and i could not keep my eyes open nor fix my mouth to laugh at any of my favorite characters. This was an absolute disapointment to my collection!!!"
5,Where are seasons 2 & 3??,"I like this show. I like it a lot. It's a comedy you can watch with your family - it has no sex (just some innuendos but nothing over the top), mostly comical violence and no one acting gay. These actors have some great chemistry between them, but I guess they should since most of the cast worked together prior to this. I like how Dee is all grown up and smiles more unlike how glum she seemed in the original one."
2,Nowhere near as good as the original.,"The original What's Happening! is definitely one of the funniest shows of all time but the new What's Happening Now! doesn't even come close to matching the original. To compare the two is like comparing the Washington Generals to the Harlem Globetrotters. Yes, there really IS that much of a disparity among the two shows.One of the funniest aspects of the original was watching Rerun and Shirley make fun of each other and the comedy and wittiness of the dialogue between Raj, Rerun, and Dwayne hanging out at Rob's Place. Now the chemistry is gone and the dialogue is boring and dry. Even Fred ""Rerun"" Berry left the show after the first season because he said the writing was terrible and he was right. The only redeeming quality of the new series was to see Raj, Shirley, Rerun, etc again.Great to see the gang back together again but lousy writing ruins the experience. They should have quit while they were ahead.... <sigh>"
2,"Interesting subject, dry book.",The subject of the Dead Sea Scrolls is a fascinating one. But the book was very dry and tedious to read.
2,"Fun toy, not very sturdy","This is a fun toy for a child, but not that sturdy. The gondola ride does not always work and the baskets have a habit of falling off, leading to missing pieces. The front portion of the grass by the elevator broke off; I have not been able to get a replacement part for this. For the price, you would expect better quality."
4,Clever little house,My daughter really likes this (she's going through a Littlest Pet phase) and it does have lots of fun gadgets included.
5,Littlest pet shop Round and Round,My 3 girls LOVE this playset and will play with it for hours on end. It entertains my 5 year old as well as my 8 and 10 year old. It is well made and very cute. It is not so huge that you have a difficult time storing it.
4,Makes a nice addition to LPS collection,With the house this set makes a world of LPS land that a child can be entertained and you don't need anything else. This has enough places to house a lot of pets. My kids get this one out every time they play. Definitely my best choice after the house of course.
3,Girls love these pets,"While I love the innocence of Littlest Pet Shop- cute little animals! I think the prices are way too high.Thank you, Grandma, for spending the money. The girls spend hours playing with these."
5,Hairdresser to the Stars,"HAIRDRESSER TO THE STARS by Ginger ""Sugar"" Blymyer is WONDERFUL! I especially liked it, because it was NOT just about Hollywood's legendary stars of the 1950's through the 1990's. But it included interesting background information about the responsibilities and interaction of movie technicians (hairdressers, cosmetologists, electricians, etc.)as well as the author's own story of her life between movies when she lived in California, West Virginia, and New Hampshire with her husband and 3 daughters. The author is VERY UPBEAT and HUMOROUS. And--SHE did not include scandalous incidents which would cause embarrassment to the stars or her colleagues! The book was a PLEASURE to read, and I am looking forward to reading her next one!"
2,Wasn't detailed enough...,"This book had so much potential. I was labeled as gifted as a child, and picked up this book in hopes of searching for the truth about why I am an introvert, and why my peers and I have had trouble fitting in at times. Facts seemed to be listed by Winner in a factual order, as if just an expanded outline, when she could have really grabbed her audience with more specifics. For example, the enclosed artwork embellished the book, especially the section on savants. Otherwise, it is kind of an irony that a book on gifted children was written so poorly, even by someone from Harvard..."
2,The book did not go far enough,"Although this book was readable, it did not go far enough to explain the problems of gifted children in terms of dealing with them day to day.The characteristics of the gifted child has been known for over ten years with nothing new added. I was disappointed with the book. I was looking forward to something more."
1,worked for a couple of days,"We had purchased these intercoms in the past for use in our home to office about 50 yards away, so i was not too worried when the first set arrived and threw away the packaging. They worked as they always had in the past for a couple of days and then just quit. i thought there might just be something wrong with that set so i ordered another set and sent the other set back in the new packaging. The new set, like the other, worked for a couple of days and now have stopped working as well. Guess i'm stuck with these. i don't know why they would work for a couple of days then quit, but they have changed something as they do not work like they use too. After getting 2 sets in a row that quit working while still brand new i would reccommend you avoid buying these."
5,great intercom,i bought this intercom to add to the 2 i brought for my mother's house. My mother is getting older and it get difficult to run up and down the stairs to ask a question or check on her. this system solved the problem for everyone in the household. Good reception and easy to use.
2,Lots of background noise not portable,I purchased this Westinghouse intercom and find it lacking in quality. It emits a high pitch shreek if placed 10-15 feet distance- which I thought a reasonable distance from room to room. Sound got better if placed further apart. I returned it the next day- thinking I can get a better portable unit with an optional AC plug- like those baby listeners.
3,Okay for the Price,"Both previous reviews are correct. I have three units. One downstairs and two upstairs. The reception is just fine. After a year, two units work and one doesn't. We tried to fix it to no avail. Still, it is relatively inexpensive and I will buy one more additional unit."
1,does not work,"Ordered this to use in the garage but it only has static on it, cant even use it in the house ,there is too much static to hear anything, I am very disappointed in this I wasted my money on this."
2,oh dear...,"Gosh, but I'd love to know what he means by ""DLERK at the end of a word is pronounced like TSLERK"". Is this Inuktitut or Klingon?The scariest thing about this dictionary is that it is not a modern reprint of a work of 19th-century missionary linguistics. It was revised by the author as recently as 1970. The introduction shows the lengths to which a Latin-biased missionary will go to avoid admitting that q (here written randomly k, kr or rk) is a letter in its own right. On the other hand, he gets points for not trying to find an infinitive where there is none to be found, and he seems to understand how the language works. Maybe he constructed the whole dictionary from written sources so he never really had to listen to anyone. You could probably feed the whole thing into a text editor, run some global conversions and come out with something that is recognizably Inuktitut."
4,happy with the result,THis item was just as I had hoped (although I didn't find what I was looking for in the book). Excellent transaction with Amazon.
3,3+5,"first of all i find it a little strange that nobody has picked up on this album and reviewed it by now, so i'll start, and despite being a novice collector of jazz albums my comments may seem a little trite non the less. Tracks 1 is weired; tracks two five and six are nice; track 3 is great; track seven is cool; but track 4 is the killer, brilliant, and in my opinion an all time classic. The only thing about Little Bs Poem is i wish it could of gone on another two or three minutes or so.I give three stars for the overall enjoyment of this album, and five stars for Little B, 8 IF I COULD.As fo Dee Dees voice i think she has a great voice, smooth, and unfaltering a true professional."
2,class assignment,"This tall tale is about how Paul Bunyan worked in the United States. He was a big man and his ox was huge. He was a lumberjack who was very strong, yet kind and gentle. He made a river called the Mississippi and cleared the west. Paul and Babe are a great legend in America.I thought this book was alright. It was a great version of this American legend. The illustrations weren't very vibrant, more dull. Don't let my opinion turn you away, read this book for yourself and see if you like it."
4,Be aware of the cover,"Not much to say about the release. One of the Stones best efforts ever, clean and pristine on heavy vinyl. It sounds better than ever! BUT heads up - the cover is not a replica of the original with the cut-outs for the slide out album jacket pictures. It is just a reprint of the original cover. Maybe I am getting grumpy, but if you are going to do a vinyl re-issue, why not replicate the coolest album jacket the Stones ever did (except for maybe the 3D Satanic Majesties)? I'd have gladly paid a few $ more for that. And it brings the 5 stars down to 4."
5,What Can I Say,"I am a Rolling Stones fan. I bought the delux edition strictly for the new songs. Songs 1 through 10 have all been great since 1978, it is the new songs I was interested in. I really enjoyed them. They were all good grooves and the Hank Williams cover of ""You Win Again"" was excellent. I would really like to see the Stones do a country album. Back to the review. ""Some Girls"" is a classic Stones album that I would recommend to anyone with an interest in listening to the Stones for the first time."
4,I like the bonus music.,"The piece ""Claudine"" is hilarious if you don't take the song too seriously. It is a true story (sort of) and fitting for today's times of ""reality"" entertainment if you can call it that."
4,I don't ever want it back.,"This was one of the better Rolling Stones albums of the 1970s. There were three hit songs from the album; ""Miss You"" (their last #1), ""Beast of Burden"" and ""Shattered"". And the rest of the songs are good, too. This deluxe edition includes a bonus disc of 12 more songs that may have been recorded at the same sessions. Some of these tracks had new vocals and instrumentation added to them. While these tracks generally aren't as good as the ones that actually made it onto the album, they are good in their own right."
4,A Diverse Album With Lotsa Fun,"I first heard this album in its entirety when I borrowed it from my uncle so I could put ""Shattered"" on a tape. It turned out that, not only did ""Shattered"" appear on my tape, but so did ""Miss You"" and ""Beast of Burden."" I'd really give this album 4 1/2 stars, because it just rocks! Mick does it all on this one, with his disco-y growl on ""Miss You,"" his country drawl on ""Far Away Eyes,"" his punk rock scream on ""Respectable,"" and his bored-with-the-city rants on ""Shattered,"" not to mention the other five songs he sings on the album. Keith makes his final rock appearance (until songs like ""Little T&A"" and ""Wanna Hold You"" on later albums) with ""Before They Make Me Run."" After this, Keith's voice got really gravelly and he began to sing sweeter, slower songs (personally, I like him like that more). This one is his last outlaw hurrah. A funny, hard-rocking album, one for the whole family (or not...)."
5,would have made a great double album,Since they released a reissue of exile on main street and they are not touring.They figured they would do this.The new tracks are all greatbut they forgot the long version of miss you and the better remix of before they make me run.It's worthwhile to get.
1,Better than Exile,"Not better than TSMR.The Stones always seem to be copying someone,the fab four in the sixties bowie and the bee gees in the seventies.Though the stones are at their best when they try stuff like the discoish Miss You and the latter Emotional Rescue as well as the earlier acid stuff on TSMR,and forgot the stodgy R&R. Would have been good had they done a cover of All You Need is Love.They could have done a video with the Beatles sitting at THEIR feet.NOT! This is an OK CD but if your not a Stones nut your better off with a compilation and that way you dont get any filler which the stones are notorious for.Try Hot Rocks,Rolled Gold or Rewind."
1,WOOF,"SHATTERED IS ONE OF THERE ALL TIME WORST,AND MISS YOU AND WHEN THE WHIP COMES DOWN GAVE ME HEARTBURN WHEN THEY CAME ON THE RADIO BACK IN 78! THERE WAS A TIME THESE GUYS PUT OUT SOME GOOD SONGS,AND EVEN SOME GREAT SONGS, BUT IT WAS BACK WHEN ED SULLIVAN WAS ON T.V. EVERY SUNDAY NIGHT!"
2,only decent stones album.,"I HATE THE ROLLING STONES. THEY WERE ONE OF THE WORST BANDS IN HISTORY!! THIS IN MY OPINION IS THEIR ONLY GOOD ALBUM. THIS HAS SOME OF THE GREATEST SONGS FEATURING SHATTERED. GET THIS WITH ALBUMS FROM DIRE STRAITS, GNR, FOREIGNER, AND METALLICA BUT STAYFAR AWAY FROM THE A BIGGER BANG, BEGGARS BANQUET, STICKY FINGERS, AND EXILE ON MAIN STREET ALBUMS WHICH SUCK BIG PERIOD!"
5,Rock n roll animals.,"The Stones in topform rejuvenated by the punkmovment and in the same time gives all the young punks a thorough lesson in rock n roll. This is a band that boiled down to one organic essence and its very to the bone. Rhythm section, guitars and Micks voice dominates but the sound is ornamented with intimate harp, sax, and keyboards. Fab songwriting all over so that the soulclassic ""Just my imagination"" should be proud to qualify (and that says a lot of the other nine songs). What more to add than thank you very much, you animals and ""sheedoby...... shattered""...etc."
3,The Stones Last Gasp...,"lets see we have Miss You and Shattered with some so - so material in between. I wonder who writes the reviews for this website? The author states, ""as good as exile.."" though a ""smidgen"" more exiting...are you nuts? Anyway, record is worth getting for Miss You and Shattered. Now, about the second bonus CD. THIS is something I wanted! Stones stripped down and smokin. Fantastic!"
1,Beware: Amazon album photos misleading,"This is a four-star album (the last good Stones album), but one-star rating here is due to deceptive depiction of album packaging on Amazon. I ordered this after observing that the posted album art photos(numbers 3 through 5) replicated the original album artwork -- complete with cut out faces and the missing starlet photos that were long ago removed from the record. But on the deluxe version I got, there are no cut outs or restoration of the missing faces -- it is simply the ""censored"" printed cover you see in the first two album photos. This is very misleading and dishonest -- apparently someone has simply posted photos of the old record cover. These images should be deleted. If there truely is a ""double-deluxe"" version you have to order to get the original album packaging, it should be made clear."
3,Overrated!,There are really 3 stand out tracks here. (guess which ones). The rest are filler. I think the next 2 albums Emotional Rescue and Tattoo You are better. You can find the good songs on any hits compilation.
3,Summer Memories,"I remember cranking this up the summer of 78' when I graduated. I think ""Shattered"" was the one that got us the most. Then Lucy made them take her likeness off the cover which made the original LP cover a collectable. I have the remastered CD version from years ago that replicates the LP which slides into the open end of the plastic jeweled case. Dont know if they do it that way anymore for this one. Other Stones CD's are just LP replicas which is fine by me now that I can store them and keep the original safe on my shelf."
3,Somewhat Un-Stones-like,"This is not one of my favorite Stones albums. Boy, was it ever played in my college days. The best tune is a cover of The Temptations' ""Just My Imagination.""Not that it is terrible. The title cut and ""Far Away Eyes"" are entertaining, and there are some other moments. My problems were with the big disco hit ""Miss You"" and finding ""Shattered,"" ""When the Whip Comes Down,"" and ""Respectable"" too harsh, without justification. The ""catchiness"" of ""Beast of Burden"" was just blah to me. It was good when ""Tattoo You"" came out, with its more characteristic Stones sound."
2,Overrated,"Maybe I'm missing something profound compared to all the other reviewers here, but as someone who has thoroughly enjoyed all the Stones golden period discs meaning Beggars Banquet onwards up to and including ""Tattoo You"", I personally find ""Some Girls"" to be their weakest disc throughout this whole period(1968 - 1981) With the vital exception of the brilliant ""Miss You"" and the mildly appealing ""Beast of Burden"", to my ears the vast majority of this disc contains pedestrian ""samey sounding"" songs which are not particularly strong in the tunes department and the overall playing is not tremendously inspired either. Sorry about the contrarian viewpoint but this is just to warn any potential buyers of this disc who may be overtempted the gushing reviews of how fantastic the album is. For my money, check out the criminally underrated ""groove trilogy"" specifically ""Goat Heads Soup"", ""Its Only Rock N Roll"" and ""Black and Blue"", these discs are funky and souful."
3,Too many drugs,"After years and years of doing drugs, the Rolling Stones began to burn out. This is probably the prime example of how the Stones slowly lost their touch. The best songs are the stuff they play on the radio; 'Shattared', 'Miss You', and 'Beast of Burden'. The other songs are alright, nothing too special. There is a really funny songs called 'Far Away Eyes'. The overall sound doesn't seem to fit; the instruments sound ugly and out of place."
3,Some girls,"Those who are seeking to expand your Rolling stones collection or begin it, I'd leave this around the bottom of the list. Starts off great with ""Miss You"" then has trouble until ""Far Away Eyes"" runs into a road block again, but finishes terrifically with ""Shattered"" and ""Beast of Burden""."
4,Review too Richard Carlton,There is nothing to get excited about here. All this material has been around for years. Why you all wet??
3,Only Decent Stones CD,"The Stones were one of the most overrated bands of all time. Ijust like this album because this has 1 decent song in Shattered.Tattoo You has another good song in Start Me Up. But the rest of their albums are crappy, even the horrible A Bigger Bang. Buy this album with albums from GNR, Dire Straits, and Foreigner butavoid all albums from The Beatles, and Led Zeppelin who suck."
4,Rock N Roll !,"Some Girls, is one of the greatest Rock n roll cds. The Stones rock with some of their best guitar Shattred, Lies, Some Girls, Respectable and When The Whip Comes Down are all great Rock n roll. Far Away Eyes is the only country its lighter than the great stones country. Miss You is a great song great sax solo from Mel Collins and Hamonica from Sugar Blue. Some Girls is one of the stones Five best a great guitar based Rock n Roll cd from The Rolling Stones."
5,Some Girls: A Classic Album,"You have to give them their props with this one. As some other reviewers point out, it is great from start to finish. Agreed, and I particularly like all the information for each song as to who played what. Keith is quite a bass player, eh? Great cover too that would be hard to emulate on a CD. In fact, that's what I really miss about LPs, the big beautiful artwork. One song in particular that I like alot more now that I'm older is ""Before They Make Me Run"", great song. They played this in concert too when I saw them at Gillette, that really surpized me."
5,My Fav. Stones album,"Im not going to sit here telling you how this is there best album. But i love the songs, they have alot of more poP -garagey type sounds going on. i love the sound of this album when im stoned. i also recommend Let It Bleed(GREAT ALBUM FROM 1969)"
3,How to ruin a classic album,"I've got four of the other Stones albums on the Virgin remasters from '94 and bought this UM release brand new thinking it would be at least equal to that, but no .. the sound quality of this release is just plain not-good. It does not compare to the quality of the '94 remasters. It sounded extra lousy in my car. Plus, my Sony Blu-Ray player couldn't even ID this disk using it's online music service. That's how little respect this version deserves. If you want this album on CD, please look at the box showing the other versions and click on the '94 remaster and get one of those used. After listening to this one that's what I did. Five stars for the content, one star for the hatchet job divided by two equals three stars."
5,Hidden Gems,An amazing re-issue by the World's Greatest Rock and Roll Band. The previously unreleased Music should have been released as a Double LP in 1978 on the original Some Girls Album. It is like listening to a brand new Stones LP. Excellent music by the Glimmer Twins.
3,Bonus Disc,The bonus disc is full of material that didn't make the album and it's clear why. It's mildly amusing to hear these songs as they have the sound of the late 70's NYC but don't get your hopes up for anything great.
4,Dirty Girls,"This album is so--and I mean this in the best sense of the word--it's so DIRTY.Beyond the lyrics--filled with hookers, junkies, losers, criminals of all kinds, back-stabbers, liars, and on and on and on--Keith and Mick seem to have taken in all of New York's then-trendy nightlife and spewed out all the worst of it--but the SOUND.The guitars never soothe, there is none of the strumblin' acoustic wash of previous LPs (save the mocking ""Faraway Eyes"") none of the sickly strings that slop all over ""Sticky Fingers""...this is just razor-sharp Fenders. Watts drums aren't thumping, they're hard-edged Whacks.Great singing--maybe the last great vocal LP for Mick--and ""Before They Make Me Run,"" one of the big 3 from Keith.I love this LP, but, years after I bought it and hid it in my room, and with threee kids of my own, this is one of only a handful of LPs I never play if my parents are within earshot.It's great rock, but it has that [sort of trashy] feeling..."
2,Universal parts,"Is ""No Spare Parts"" really from the Some Girls era? It sounds more like the boys are cashing in on that hip-hop rhythm that's been going around for the last few years. And if you don't don't know what I'm talking about you haven't been listening to the current country and/or pop or you're just too caught up in the sheep-dip to realize it, as it's the same rhythm ""everybody"" is singing along to these days.Other than that these songs sound more like the non album b-sides from the Voodoo lounge era. In fact ""So Young"" was issued on the ""Out of Tears"" single along with another non- album track called, ""I'm Gonna Drive"".......not that there's anything wrong with that!"
3,Is it because it is an import?,"I love this album but this particular copy sounds terrible. It is so heavy on the treble that it is not enjoyable. It is an Argentinian import. Could that be the cause for the poor quality? I have never had any problems with imports before but am wary now. Oh, and the cd smelled awful. Not real happy with this provider(Tango Tienda)."
2,TOTALLY OVERRATED,"It's incredible what marketing can do. a band like the rolling stones and mick jagger , who's have been selling illusion for the past 24 years or more ( everyone know they finished after Taylor leave), have been repeating the same formula in making their songs ( it seem that they have a formula for the rockers and the slow ones) in every record since 74 , and some girls is no exception. The songs that sound a little different sound different but in the wrong way ( Miss you - Disco). I think they should listen to pete townshends song ""new song"" about this particular subject"
2,OVERRATED AS HELL!!!!,"This record is extremely overrated. First of all, at least five songs are written in the same key and have similar rhythms. Second, the singles Miss You and Beast Of Burden are cheesy pop/disco oriented songs that are overly repetitive that are not appropriate for the Stones style. Respectable, Before They Make Me Run, and the Title Track are good songs and Far Away Eyes is OK but the rest of the material is just dissapointing."
4,"Love the songs, not the sound","I happened to play this ""newly remastered"" CD in my car right after listening to the remastered ""Beggars Banquet."" Wow, talk about night and day! Or even chalk and cheese, or bangers and mash or whatever you want to call it.BB sounded great but Some Girls hurt my ears. It has a thin, tinny sound that's not all all what I expect or want the slightly grungy RStones to sound like. I'm pretty sure Charlie and Bill showed up for the recording sessions but there's scant evidence that they had real mikes on them. I see this has been mentioned in other posts so I wish to second that emotion - the second disc makes this collection worth having, but it's not pleasant to listen to my old faves on disc one. I guess a new-er new remaster will appear in a few years when they change record labels again."
4,"""Some Girls"" by some guys.","I think most would agree that this is one of the great ""Stones"" albums. Everything style-wise is on this one. ""Miss You"" and ""Beast Of Burden"" are huge hits, and ""Shattered"" was as well. ""Far Away Eyes"" is classic, the Keith sung ""Before They Make Me Run"" is a favorite of mine, and the track ""Some Girls"" is so good I know a band who named themselves after it. Overall this may not be in their top three albums ever, but I'd call it number four, and give it as many stars. Anyone who says otherwise is telling ""Lies""."
2,Great songs poor recording,"I'm not sure what the producer of this ""remaster"" had in mind but, the sound is not very good. All the songs are overly bright."
5,Linda Q,This is one of the best Stones albums ever!!! I love the way they poke fun (especially about New York in Shattered.) Every song on this album is different in its own way and you just cannot sit still. If you can sit still during this album you are surely dead. After dancing around for the whole album I am pooped. It is GREAT. One of their best.
5,the last great stones album.,"1978. the last great stones album. i happen to think (unlike many others) that they've done some very good stuff since then, but this is definitely the end of the line for greatness in their discography. ""just my imagination,"" ""repectable,"" ""before they make me run,"" which is about as good a thing as keith richards ever did, and ""beast of burden"" are all classics. mick jagger's voice is brimming with personality here (instead of falling into a caricature of himself, which sometimes has happened in these later years). keith and ron wood splatter the recording with great guitar licks. and every song is strong to great. a wonderful piece of rock and roll. come back, boys. dylan did it. you can too. i know that you can."
5,4 Times the Charm,"This is the 4th time I've purchased this album starting with the original release so yeah I guess I like it (and those who ""borrow"" it from me really like it too). Early on the Stones were criticized for being derivative in their concept albums - trying to keep up with the Beatles or the latest trends. This album is simply, uniquely the Stones. All their influences are here but they've been fully Stonesified. This album is a seemingly effortless classic. Excellent!"
3,there last alright album,i love miss you&beast of burden.but the album is so/so after that.they are the most overrated band ever! they have been playing the same song now for 20 years.i used to really like them but after a while everything all sounded the same.get this disc and try to find only there hits.the rest is filler.
3,I thought newer was better!!!,"I used to think folk were whingers and whiners who bagged re-issues. Surely with superior new technology the most recent version would be the best, I reasoned. Oh WOW! The ""Some Girls"" Deluxe Edition arrived and I put the disk on expecting a sonic orgasm. Unfortunately, it was shrill and compressed beyond belief. Having read the reviews imploring me to get hold of Virgin 1994, I returned to the dust encrusted CD sitting on my shelf. Basically a deaf person could hear how far superior the 1994 Virgin release sounds with far better realised bass. I'm not kidding. It is blatantly obvious! I will never dismiss naysayers as misery guts ever again! Sadly it is at us$175.00 as I write this review for new. Get second hand. I know I will stock up on a few at US$5 each because it is my most played Stones post-Decca CD. Take care Y'all. You will agree with me!"
3,some great songs but way overrated group,"i loved missyou and beast of burden but as the case with there records since and pretty much before all there records sound the same.it's a shame how much attention they get for ripping off soul and blues pioneers.ask muddy walters,buddy guy,bo didley,little richard etc.. about those riffs? and i laughed when stones fans booed the then prince off stage when he opened for them in 81 what were they scared of originality? the stones are strictly by the numbers ain't nothing new came out in years.alot of that is mick's fault cuz he wants to stay hip with what's happening.keith richards i like his side projects ok.but with the exception of a few songs since this disc they have been under a stone for me.get a greatest hits collection and call it a career."
4,Some Girls CD,I received this order in very good condition and time.The sound is quite original and I'm tempted to play it every now and then. Many thanks to my seller.
3,The Stones' only good album.,"I'm not a Rolling Stones fan. I dislike all their other poser albums, maybe with the exception of Tattoo You. This is their best one and it has some of my favorite songs in Shattered. Getthis with Tattoo You, but avoid all the other albums from this band especially the new one which suck til day. Thanks,Let It Be."
3,Hard to read edition,"My review concerns the quality of the ""Qontro Classic Books"" paperback edition, not the content of Croly's book. Croly originally published the work in 1909 and it apparently has passed into the public domain. This Qontro edition is an oversize paperback, but is very hard to read because it is set in a small and hard to read typefont - I think it's just Courier. I would guess the publisher scanned a library copy into Word and hit the Print button. The table of contents doesn't give page numbers for the beginning of chapters. There is no forward or other comments by recent scholars, just the bare text of Croly's book."
2,Not Facsimile and NO Index,"This Filiquarian edition is in a good quality binding and paper but it is not a facsimile so pagination is off. The original had an extensive index [see Gutenberg e-copy]; there is absolutely NO index in this edition. Look for another edition for academic usage. Amazon as usual supplied a copy in Very Good condition even tho they only claimed ""Good""."
1,Don't trust these reviews.,"Something fishy is going on with most of these reviews. I think the same person, perhaps the author, wrote them."
5,Is Decheonbae Jones a genius or just real!,"Hello every one I am new to Decheonbae Jones poetry and must say he is a GOD in my book. You can not deny him and the treasure he posses in the meaning behind his works. I am a very shock on the way that he just jumps out on you and really explains the humanity of truth, I swear he is bonafide and gifted in the arts. My job seems so much easier now with his knowledge,I don't see how he can possibilty do better than VERISMO but if he do I will be there. ""Hey DECHEONBAE if you write a novel what is it going to be about, I really want to know more of your mind!""'Love it was robust..."""
4,Fables,"THe recording quality of this is not up the standards set by Mingus' prior Columbia releases, but if you are content to listen to Bird and the Duke, you are used to it, eh?Apart from the sound quality, the playing is super intense and masterful. Mingus, Dolphy(alto), Clifford Jordan (tenor), Jaki Byard (piano), and Danny Richmond (drums)surely strut their stuff, boasting an incredible 40 plus minute rendition of ""Fables of Faubus,"" along with Duke's ""Sophisticated Lady,"" and an obscurity, ""ATFW USA.""For this period, the REVENGE set is more thorough, but this version of ""Fables"" is by far superior."
5,Captivatingly Different!,"I love fantasy books. I cannot get enough of them, but after awhile, no matter how well-written they are, the stories tend to be all the same. This does not mean I do not read them, it only means that it takes an exceptional book to catch my attention. HOTL is such a book. I agree with the other reviewer concerning the cumbersome Gaelic names and places. I had to continuously use the Glossary in the back, but in a way this added to the mysteries and fantastical qualities of the story. I was indeed a stranger in a strange land. I was captivated throughout the book. Ms. Aratyr should continue to write. She is seriously under appreciated and unknown right now. I highly recommend this book for fantasy readers who are looking for that feeling you had when you read your very first fantasy book. You know what I mean."
5,A person who tried Memory2000,I am still taking it. Wouldn't be without it. My memory has improved greatly! I am glad there is a product that helps.
1,Proven Wrong,"This book was a sensation when it first appeared in 1980.But then something unexpected (by Thurow at least) happened. Ronald Reagan was elected President and ignited a period of spectacular economic growth, coupled with low inflation and high employment, that lasted through the next two administrations - thus proving Thurow totally wrong!Why do publishers keep reprinting books that have been invalidated by history? Why not allow then to sink silently into the dustbin of failed theories where they belong?As Charlie Chan once said: Theory like mist on eyeglasses. Obscures facts."
5,Review of Red River series by Lauraine Snelling,"The whole Red River series is a marvelous read. We have got acquainted with all the character, feeling like they are old friends! We heartily recommend this book, as well as the rest of the series. ADG"
4,Very Good,"This entire series has been excellent. It really puts a prospective on what life was like for immigrants and early farmers in the northern plains area. No frills, no fancy story lines, just good reading."
1,Drivel - Utter Drivel!,"Pure drivel. Only wish that I could find the author as humorous as he finds himself. There is nothing of any real substance here, but the auther does like to hear himself talk and is easily amused by his own meanderings; unfortunately I was not. I do NOT recommend this audio program."
2,too small to get gloves into too,Didn't use because afraid I would not be able to get my hands out if I needed to. Should have returned.
1,buddys,"why is luc van braekel writing reviews of his colleagues book...?they work together at the brussels journal a very political organisation.the book is more politics than history with a thinly veiled point.. belgium's failed experiment (country not yet broken up) is the future for eu attempts at statehood. though is the eu a state? some of the assertions made about politics in 19c belgium are a little simplistic so yes the royal family intrigue is laid on thick. its a polemic though not an appraisal and poor really.from the brussels journalWho We AreEditor:Paul BelienWebmaster:Luc Van BraekelWriters:Chresten Anderson, CopenhagenErnest Baert, LondonAlexandra Colen, Brussels"
2,Neat little collection,"This is a pretty good collection for the Mickey beginner. I wouldn't purchase it however if you already have the Walt Disney Treasures ""Mickey Mouse in Living Color"" series because all the shorts are on those DVDs as well."
1,1 Star because it SUCKS!!,"Why would you get this haphazard DVD with only six cartoons cut and censored, while you can get the 32 cartoon, uncut, uncensored, AND Bonus Features in the Walt Disney Treasures Series. Save your money on this one, and look around for the Mickey Treasures. Horrible."
3,beautiful but not worth the money,"The desk is very attractive, however it took a long time to build and a week later, the screws on the hinge on the drop down door stripped out and we had to use loctite glue to hold it in place! Other than that its very nice. Just too much money for the value"
2,small desk,Purchased this desk for a small apartment. It met my needs at the time but it is over priced for what you get.
3,Good but not good enough for Alice,This is another trash/zipper catches skin type of album. Lots of catchy songs but nothing you'd want show off to your friends out of the collection. This album is a lot more mellow than the previous (Eyes of Alice Cooper) and seems to focus on just catchy tunes and funny songs. Alice took it heavy in 2000 with Brutal Planet and he should have continued to pursue his dark themes. The eyes was alright but compared to the Alice hardcore fans love this album sucks. Get it to add to your collection and play it occasionally so it doesn't wear out and maybe it will be more appreciated in the future.
2,what happened? alice,"ok this is not the wicked young man alice cooper(psycho killer in all of us, the axe murderer, the spoiled child, the abuser,the abused, hes the victim, perpetrator, he's the gunslinger, and he's the guy lying dead in the middle of the street)this is vincent not the one we love alice cooper he changed after dragontown. where is the darker side of him?"
1,What Happened To The King Of Shock Rock?,"This album doesn't even deserve one star, it deserves none. What happend to the magic that is Alice Cooper? This album is really bad,the song ""Dirty Diamonds"" sounds like it's been ripped off from Aerosmith's song ""Get A Grip"". If you listen closely to the chours of Dirty Diamonds and compare it with the begining of ""Get A Grip"" you'll see that it sounds exactly the same. This album deserves it's name it is dirty and not in the good way. Also, I was shocked to see on Alice's web site, that he compared this album to ""The Eyes Of Alice Cooper"". ""The Eyes...."". Is a much better album by far. this one is just horrible. And so I say: Alice what happend?. I hope his next album will be better."
1,As Expected,"Album starts as one would expect, some meaningless rock with the standard mastering of 2005 (way to loud and overcompressed).Track 2 is probably the worst song he has ever recorded.From track 3 the album begins to lighten up a little with tracks that are almost interesting.Back to meaningless rock at the end.Alice Cooper died with the Last Temptation.This is al album by an old greedy man, who has clearly lost the ability to sing."
4,Alice Does it Again !!!,"Alice Cooper's latest release leaves me to wonder how this artist can tour every year after all these years and still have a fresh sound after 35 years of making albums. After the first listen I already had 3-4 songs in my head. The genius song writing of Alice shows his funny side (Perfect& Saga of Jesse Jane) and dark side (Zombie Dance). It is a shame that this album will not see the light of day from radio one. Alice turns out better songs than all of the new ""in"" artist and they are not even in his league when it comes to showmanship, song quality and longevity. The only song I would have left off this album was Stand which was a duet with rapper Xzhibit. Stop this album after Zombie Dance and you will know what I am talking about. It is almost criminal how Alice Cooper is not in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. He is so deserving of what he has given us over the years on a consistent basis. Long Live Alice !!"
4,Raw Alice Cooper,"After a couple listens(first listen I hated half the album) I can honestly say that this is pure classic Alice Cooper rock. I would throw it in with Lace and Whiskey/From the Inside/DaDa. Weird combos I know and probably not very appealing to anyone except the hardcore cooper fans.Sega of Jesse Jane and Pretty Ballerina sound like they belonged on Lace and Whiskey.Steal that Car and Sunset Babies are From the Inside for sure!Six Hours sounds very DaDa era'ish. Reminds me of Pass the Gun Arond or Fresh Blood.The first 4 tracks to me are the worst(Woman of Mass Destraction, Perfect, You Make Me Wanna and Dirty Diamonds)... sound like left over from Eyes of Alice Cooper.Other standouts include Zombie Dance, Your Own Worst Enemy and Stand featuring Xzibit which is super catchy and hard!To sum up I think this album is amazing for Hardcore Alice fans who own all 24 studio albums. The rest of the population will have to warm up to it."
5,Alice As Good As Ever,I give 5 stars to a record if I like it all the way thru and some things really stand out as great. Dirty Diamonds passes that test. Hey I had his earliest albums and this one is just as good or better than anyhing he's done (the effect in its day of Love it to Death excepted). I had recently bought the Left Banke just to hear one of my favorite lost songs - Pretty Ballerina. Then Alice goes and covers it and covers it well. He proves he has a great singing voice on this one. Stand is a great message song and one of the best he's done. The Ballad of Jessie Jane is unique and fun. It's quality Alice Cooper. A little more mature but still weird enough. I'm grateful a nice guy like him can still be this creative in the rock experience.
2,"Story OK, but needs professional editing.","The story seemed to be decent, but was difficult to read due to all the typos and other errors that don't get caught by a spell check. It was frequently difficult to determine which character was speaking dialogue and there was at least one instance where the author called one of his heroes by the wrong name. If he can't keep the characters straight how can a reader? There were several minor characters whose names changed spelling from one page to the next.Jim, if you ever write another book, hire a pro to edit it!"
4,Funny & fast-paced,"Men of Extreme Action is a humerous look at what might happen if twoaging action stars, who hate each other, by the way, are forced to workon a movie together in a last-ditch effort to save both their careers.The main characters are Wolfe and Steele, two actors with super-staregos, trying to recapture their glory days. In order to do so theyreluctantly agree to co-star in an action movie, but there are forcesat work busily sabotaging their efforts - and that's aside from theirown egos!I found the premise of Men of Extreme Action interesting andbelievable. You start off disliking both Wolfe and Steele, but as thestory progresses you begin to root for them. The dialogue is witty andflows well, and the action is non-stop. Men of Extreme Action is athoroughly enjoyable read and I recommend it highly."
2,"Recall is hard to get a hold of, my 'smart balls' don't work and C/D don't work","Not the best toy I own. I wanted to send it back after a week because the letter C wouldn't say it's name. After a while it started working, but then D stopped. According to the online demo the balls will say their colors when dropped in the chute. Mine never have done this.My son likes this product and uses it. As a parent I am disappointed in the quality."
1,TOPPLES WAY TOO EASILY!!!!,"I cannot believe the parents that continue to say this is a great toy in the same breath that complains their child has fallen with this toy toppling on top of them. There are other ways for children to learn without getting hurt! I wanted to be different than all my other friends that bought the sturdier table-like version of this toy. My daughter would try to pull herself up on this and it would topple over, sometimes pinning her against her play yard gate. I can't believe the designers did not consider it's stablility a huge priority."
4,My daughter loves this toy,"We bought the playground for Christmas, and overall, I'm pleased with this toy. The only thing I'm not pleased with is the tube topper they used after the recall. It makes the leapfrog playground ball slide work only half way. You can still push the ball through the chute, and it still tells you the color of the ball, but half the fun was watching it go all the way down to the ground and make silly sound effects at the bottom. Obviously it doesn't do that now. I'm just wondering why they didn't extend to clear sheild instead. That would solve the arm getting stuck problem. Other than that problem, this toy is great and has kept my daughter very entertained!"
2,Be Careful!,"I was looking up the age limits on this toy because it was donated to the child care center I work at. Yes the infants love it, its musical and there are lots of activities on it. It's got the alphabet, the ball tube, and a few spinny things on it. However, I feel that it's not a good 'pulling up' toy. I had a 10 month old infant try to pull up on it and it tipped over on him once he was standing and he got a black eye. I have also had a few 2 year olds get their arms stuck in the opening. No major injuries but some scratching and bruising. The age limits should be increased on this toy. 2 to 3 would be more appropriate."
5,Best toy I have ever purchased,"My son is still using and learning with this toy 18 months after we purchased it. He recites and is begining to recognize his ABC's at two years old largely because of this toy. He loves all of the different tunes, sounds, letters, words that this toy plays. He is still discovering new things this wonderful educational toy offers. There are so many things going on with this toy that I think he will out grow it before it bores him."
4,2 year old's birthdaty gift,This toy was selected for my two year old daughter .What I have observed so far is that she likes the use of the balls in the learning mode the most . The alphabet is her second choice as she loves to try reciting it .The only problem with this is that it does not play the whole song unless you continuously move the bicycle .She loses focus quick as a result .The music mode is usually her next thing and she likes to hum along to the songs .She only has it a month now so still looking to see what she learns .I will likely edit this review later on.
5,Please watch your child,My son loves this toy. It does slide but since he loves it so much we play with it together. He loves to hits all the buttons and I have found all the features quite durable. I would recommend this toy to anyone as long as you are willing to play with your child.
5,Love this toy!,"This toy is great...she (my almost 11 month year old daughter) LOVES to play with the ball tubes. She has so much fun putting the balls down the holes and seeing where they end up. She also loves the little book area and the spinning part of the toy...this was a big hit and a great purchase. Plus, it is a great toy to help her pull herself up...and it is stable enough so it doesn't move when she is holding on and standing by it."
4,great play center!!!,This is a great play center!!! It has really helped my daughter learn to pull up and stand for extended periods of time. (Exactly why I purchased it!) This center has soooo many activites that she never seems to get bored. The only negative comment I have is that it comes with a cover that snaps into the ball return that does not come out once inserted (I learned this the hard way). Otherwise a great buy and I would highly recommend.
4,Plenty of fun here.,"I bought this toy about 6 months ago for my daughter's first birthday. Her favorite part is the hole and tube for the balls to go down. She tries to put every toy down the hole. Now, there was a piece that is supposed to go over the hole because there was a compliant that kid's hands can get stuck down the hole. Frankly, after watching her play with it I personally decided to keep the part, but not put it on.Other cool features are the dangley things, the spinning airplane thing and the alphabet buttons.Overall a fun toy and my daughter still plays with it on a daily basis. The only reason I gave it 4 stars was the recall piece to block the hole. That can be a turn off, when choosing a toy."
4,pretty impressed,"I wasn't sure that my son (12 mos.) was ready for some of the activity, but when we set it up he played for an hour! I am happy with the activities and the knowledge it provides him and the songs aren't bad either. His birthday was 3 weeks ago and he's still playing with it."
5,Better than I could have asked,I purchased this item for my 10 month old son who is just learning to stand and cruise. It was very easy to assemble and I am really delighted how sturdy the base is. Even though it is lightweight it does not topple easily when my 26lb son is trying to pull himself up on it. He never tires of putting the ball in and seeing it drop to the bottom and starting all over again. As an added bonus my 3 1/2 year old son likes playing with it too and understands the concept of the letters obviously much better than the younger one. I definitely recommend this toy.
4,Lots a fun and laughs......music galore,I purshased thi sfor my sons 1st birthday. He loves it. It has great interaction to keep him entertained and the sound effects and music are enjoyable not to annoying. One of my favorite things as a parent is that it shuts itself off after a short time of inactivity! It even says hello and Goodbye. Great fun. My 4 year old likes to barrow it to learn his alphabet too! SUPER TOY WOTH THE MONEY!!
4,Great toy!,My son received this toy for his first birthday and he loves it. He really enjoys the ball drop and all the songs it plays.
4,Great Toy!,"My daughter was 7 mo. old when I bought this, and she loved it! She's gotten a little bored of it lately, but she still wanders over to it and plays on it for a while. I think it is well worth the $$."
1,The most dangerous toy!,"This toy has been called the most dangerous toy. ""Over the past six years, no product caused more injuries than Leap Frog playgrounds, a toy that prior to its 2006 recall left crawling children susceptible to scrapes and bruises. The product has since been reinstated on store shelves."" Perhaps a fun toy, but watch out!"
2,It will fall over on your child!,"I love the idea of this table and my son loves it...as long as I am there with him. He is 7 months old and able to pull himself up to the standing position, but when he does so with this table, it often falls over on top of him. Actually, it has fallen on top of him when he was already standing! That is not a safe toy. My husband won't let him play with it anymore. It is too unstable. : ("
1,THIS ITEM WAS RECALLED AT ALL TARGET STORES,THIS ITEM IS VERY DANGEROUS AND HAS BEEN RECALLED FOR BABYS CHOCKING!!!!!!!!
2,"Poorly made, lousy instructions","The instructions for this piece of junk are lousy at best. They don't tell you when to put the stickers on, so you have to take apart after you've just made half the thing. The ramps don't line up properly so they either pop out of the garage levels or don't sit right on the floor. The manufacturer should be ashamed to put their name on this thing. I can't believe Marvel would allow this to be on the market. For the price, I don't expect incredible engineering, but at least make it usable."
5,DEVIL-PROOFING PRAYERS,"I read this book in one day,it was that engaging. It is AWESOME. I refer to it often.BOB LARSON GOD BLESS YOU."
3,BRM Saga Vol 3,"I was a little disappointed that the book did not include details of the H 16 engine. The engine was a key item in the monocoque car era and I was looking forward to read all the details of it's development. Although the race history was well documented it was really a copy of Tony Rudd's reports to Alfred Owen.There are references to the H 16 being in Vol 4, I am wondering how a whole volume can be dedicated to one engine.This saga is not up to the standard of Vols 1 & 2."
4,Deliciously surprising,"Having met the author and knowing his musical skills, I was curious as to what his writing capabilities would comprise.Truly a renaissance of artistry, Hill skillfully weavesan interesting and engaging cast of characters with moments of true and unexpected romance that caused not a small amount of erotic response.Not a fan of drippy romance, I did enjoy this work and passed it on to friends"
5,An emotional adventure!,"A novel of extraordinary interest and scope, epic in the traditions of Mitchner and Stone, riveting and passionate and well researched. I will be insulted if it is not made into a major motion picture. I had difficulty putting it down each evening to get some sleep. It is about time that an intelligent book of this genre has entered into the mainstream literature of America. Suitable reading for those interested in learning about the conditions of life in the Mother Lode of California. As a student of California history I can attest that the events portrayed are not at all far from the realities of the period."
4,HANG ON,"Hang on for the ride of you life ! This book details an amazing journey of a young man across the country, and over the pacific ocean. It explores the dynamics of feelings and emotions, and the many people that touch his life through out the story. This novel offers every range of emotion and excitement for the reader, from love, anguish, suspense, intrigue, and mystery. The story is captivating. A MUST READ !!!!"
3,Could be better but getting some use out of it,"I placed the main unit in the living room and the other units in upstairs bedrooms. I had did not have problems with reception unless the microwave was going. I gave the item 3 stars because, within 6 months, one of the units stopped working and we could not figure out how to get it working. I dont think the warranty lasts as long as it should."
2,Questionable product,"I bought three of these units plus a doorbell. Sometimes they work, sometimes they do not, and they create a lot of static noise. Sometimes a unit emits noise even when it is not in use, which can be quite annoying. I investigated these problems and learned that the units need to be connected to outlets wired to a single phase to work. If they are plugged into outlets connected to two different phases they may not work. This explains why the units work in some locations but not in other, but does not explain why a unit connected to one outlet sometimes work and sometimes does not. Furthermore, the system is prone to interference from electrical appliances. Since most homes have three phase wiring and use a lot of appliances that can generate interference, this suggest a faulty design concept."
1,Junk,"Since it works only on one circuit it's really great if you need an intercom from one side of a room to the other, except it'll feed back if you try to use it. Otherwise there is no mention that it works only on one circuit so you'll end up spending an hour or two trying to figure out why it works when you test it, but why it won't work when you finally put it where you want it. If you didn't understand like I did that some home smart systems run transmit along wiring you'd never figure it out and it still took me awhile to figure it out.That bullpucky about 1500 feet? Who has a house with a 1500 ft circuit? What one room a fifth of a mile long?I long for a company that is smart enough to do the research themselves. I DON'T want 500 choices where 497 are crap. I want THREE choices. I want the best only cheap, medium, expensive. Retailers should do something to earn their money like do some testing on what you sell."
4,Works great.,Westinghouse 3 Channel Wireless Intercom - WHI-3CWe plugged one unit in on the second floor of the house and one in the main bedroom on the first floor and they worked perfectly. We were expecting problems after reading the reviews because of the age of the house wiring. We have had no problems with the units just our ancient wiring in the house. We like the units and are happy with them. They are perfect for what we wanted them for.
3,How Intercom Works,"A technical explanation may help users understand how this kind of intercom works.Most houses are wired with the capability of 220 volts (to run dryer, range, water heater, etc.). 220 volt home electricity consists of two 110 volt ""phases"". All the circuits in the house are divided approximately equally between the two phases. That means that there are two sets of compatible wiring in the house.Unless you open and study the circuit breaker box, the only practical way to discover which circuits are on the same phase is by experiment. Plug in one monitor where you want it, set it locked on with a sound source (e.g., radio), and search around the other desired point to find an outlet that ""talks"" to you via the intercom."
3,You Get What You Pay For,"I placed the main unit in the kitchen and the other 2 units in upstairs bedrooms. I had absolutely no problems with reception. I gave the item 3 stars because, before the year was out, one of the units upstairs stopped working and we could not repair it. Be sure to know your warranty and to keep your receipt. This is a relatively inexpensive, model, so I think I got what I paid for."
1,Junk,"These intercoms do not work as advertised. They worked while plugged in to some outlets but not others. When they did work, the background noise/static was at an unacceptable level. I'll eat the restocking fee just to be rid of them."
1,Horrible product,"I purchased two sets of these intercoms for our home. They appear simple, set the channel the same on each box and press talk. At less than 30 feet absolutely no signal was received. At 10 feet (across the kitchen) The intercoms were full of static and feedback. An absolutely terrible product. DO NOT Buy these"
2,false advertising,"I spent an hour with my wife trying to figure out why the damn things onlyworked when in some rooms and not others,all the while thinking that the signal was wireless. Was going to ship them back when i discovered this review site explaining that they only work if they are plugged into outlets that are on the same line.Now i will look to see if we can find a line that will work and stil be whee we want them....none of this was made clear in the advertising or the instruction manual....very deceptive and frustrating."
1,Not a Quality Mirror,"Arrived with bubbles on the bottom portion of the regular side of mirror. Then when I picked it up, it actually moved and crackled inside of the frame. I am returning for a refund."
4,"Great CD, however....","this CD misses a 5 star review for the omission of two songs: Find Your Way Back and Familiar Stranger. Of course, there is always the double disk Hits collection."
5,Thinking about flying anytime soon...You must read this book,"I must agree with the other reviews of this book -- it is a captivating read. The only reason it took me two days to finish this book is that I do have a job and family that need a good portion of my time.This book was very well written and provides an inside look at the founding of a business where the needs of the customer truly is what it values the most. In fact, this book should be a must read for anyone thinking of starting their own business regardless of the industry."
5,A simple question leads to a great new airline,"Why does airline travel have to suck? That question served as the bedrock for JetBlue's beginning and continued excellence.This book follows JetBlue from Dave Neeleman's initial conception of it shortly after his stint at Southwest through it's 5 year anniversary (the point at which the FAA no longer considers an airline a startup). Although there were some rocky points, the sheer dominance of simple, creative common sense is inspiring.Just one example: employee ID numbers where not assigned sequentially. Instead of #1, Neeleman was employee #82226. This was done to discourage hierarchy and an the unearned sense of importance based on seniority alone."
2,"A Superficial ""Puff Piece""","""Blue Streak"" goes on and on about customer service and happy employees, as though the two are directly linked and create a profitable entity. Forgotten (or neglected) is how much jetBlue's success depends on aircraft utilization (eg. fast aircraft turnaround - copied from Southwest; long hours/day), low fuel costs (eg. Southwest's hedging program), low costs overall (Southwest and AirTrans both beat jetBlue), ability to bypass intense competition (eg. early Wal-Mart and Southwest locations), and ability to fill planes at maximum revenues (eg. using intelligent price discrimination).Recently jetBlue's financial results went into the loss column, and the stock was downgraded. Other airlines are lowering their costs (eg. using bankruptcy court to force union givebacks and shed pensions) and prices, and parking many of their old fuel-guzzlers. Thus, competition is intensifying and it will take much more than employee smiles for jetBlue to succeed."
2,Not a good read,"The story of JetBlue is far from over and, as I write this, the airline is not doing very well. Its debt has gone up significantly and is posting net losses that are quite large. This relates to the book as it is not written from a neutral, objective poiint of view.There is nothing wrong with that, as long as the reader is looking for a positive-spin entertainment piece. However, this book is more of a vanity piece for the management versus a legitimate business read.John W. Kercheval, III"
3,"Works, I guess","It does work, if you don't move it. The recharge last a while, it does turn on and run well. Only issues I have are that it is used to sanitize my autistic daughters oral stimulating tool, on the go. The slightest bump and it pops open and starts the cyce over. The rubber toothbrush holding piece isn't really holding well with movement. During travel may have to take out the rechargable batteries so it isn't starting and stopping with every bump in your baggage."
3,Easy-read textbook,"Covers many topics in easy to read language and in a short amount of time. Not a good keeper for a reference book, but a good one for ideas for papers and quick refrence."
1,Nonstick coating peels off,"Although the product does a good job at pressing garlic, the nonstick coating peels off very easily. After a couple months, it was coming off the interior of the garlic chamber. This seemed to be from friction during regular use. Then I noticed it was bubbling and peeling off various places around the handles. And all this just a few months after purchase. Disappointing."
1,Cheap metallic surface flakes off,"Take a look at the images I uploaded that show the coating flaking off. I started out as a big fan of Zyliss products, but having used them for a couple years, I've realized that some of the products are poor quality due to the cheap matte metallic finish that wears away with regular use & hand-washing. This garlic press is one such case. I always use scrubbers intended for non-stick pans, but this wear still occurs. And who knows what kinds of chemicals are in the cheap finish they use? Looks great out of the box, but they show their age before long. I notice this particularly on this product and on the ice cream scoop. If Zyliss used the identical design, but made it out of plain stainless steel, I'd be thrilled and would give 5-stars. For comparison, their pizza slicer and peelers ARE stainless steel and are fantastic 5-star products."
3,"Learning curve, inconvenient cleaning attachment","This works better than other presses I've used, but there are several things I haven't enjoyed.First, after five months, the non-stick coating is beginning to wear off. Although the blackening on the pressed garlic is apparently not dangerous, it's unattractive.Second, the design of the press is such that it requires a fair bit of muscle to work even two cloves through.Third, I found it hard to get to grips with the cleaning attachment. It is a fussy little thing and not safe just to throw in the dishwasher, where it will not stay safely on the top rack.Finally, although it is now a fairly quick process for me to use this, it did take a number of weeks before it became comfortable.In all, it is a serviceable gadget, but the wear and the learning curve are real downsides. When something better becomes available -- and Cook's Illustrated says something better is now available (Kuhn Rikon 2315 Epicurean Garlic Press) -- I'll switch."
1,Worked well... until it broke,"This thing pressed garlic like a champ, I was using it almost every day. Then after a month or two I was pressing a large clove and the bottom popped out. Past the return period now, so this was quite unfortunate. I wouldn't recommend or buy again."
1,Loved it until it broke after a month,I had an old version of this garlic press for over 10 years. This one felt flimsy compared to my old sturdy one and broke after a month.
1,Was a 5 star for 8 months.. now 1.,"So.. I have had a few garlic press's in my time and thought this was 'my forever press'. It was smooth, simply, and easy for even my wife to squeeze.The problem came at the 8 month mark i was using it for dinner (a dinner party where i had garlic in various dishes and had to mince numerous cloves) and the damn thing just broke. The bottom screen part that dices the garlic just came out.We hand wash this and take care every time..Now this is a 1 star going in the trash."
2,a little less than okay,"first of all, it is true--you will have to apply a lot of pressure to use this instrument. you can't fit more than 2 cloves of garlic in press. when you try to press two cloves as opposed to one, you do have to apply even more pressure. the cleaner that comes with it is helpful but it can be really hard to remove the garlic that is on the outside face of the press where it comes out. i need to scrape it with a knife just to get the garlic that i have pressed off to be used in cooking. pressure and time applied for use and having to clean it each time i press it and the great energy and force needed to press the garlic makes it worthless. i can do it the old way which is peel the cloves and use a grater. the old way doesn't hurt my hand and i save time. i was really hoping this would be something i can use in the kitchen and save myself time and mess. its not. back to grater."
3,works great! durable? not as much,"I had the garlic press for a few months at least. It work great. But the coating started to chip off. It looked like it was made out of metal, but it was covered with some paint stuff. I don't want pieces of paint in my garlic paste! So watch out. I would recommend to buy a garlic press without any coating. This product supposed to have 5-year warranty. Does anyone know how to get it?"
5,Best Garlic Press!,I've used and searched for many garlic presses and I like this one the best so far. It's pretty easy to use. The cleaner really helps a lot and makes a difference. It can be hard to press if you put 2 or 3 cloves in but not really that hard. One clove at a time and the job is pretty fast! It's fantastic that you don't have to peel the skin you just stick it in and PRESTO - lots of garlic out and toss the skin left in the press. Spend the extra money on Zyliss. Can't beat Swiss made.
3,Bigger is Not Always Better,"Yes, this new larger size garlic press can squeeze up to 3-4 cloves at a time of garlic. No problem! But you'll need arms of Atilla the Hun to do it.Fortunately I didn't throw out my 20 year old (at least) original Zyliss garlic press and am back using it, while the new larger size lives comfortably undisturbed in my kitchen drawer."
4,Works well,I got this to replace an old one I broke. We believe this one crushes the garlic more then the flip ones
5,"High capacity, easy to use and clean","What surprised me most is the capacity of this press. I can press about 4-5 medium-sized cloves at a time without any problem. It does a good job of expelling the garlic fully, and usually takes just a quick rinse to clean it out. Haven't had to use the included cleaning tool that often, but it is handy to have.Note - if you fill it to capacity, you need fairly large hands and a strong grip to compress it fully. Might be tough for someone with small hands to use at capacity."
4,Convenient and Easy,"Recommended by CooksIllustrated, this garlic press is convenience at a reasonable price. The garlic comes out consistently and without too much effort. The cleaner is very handy. Make sure you use it because the coating does tend to scratch. That being said, handwashing is recommended for longevity. I was so impressed, I bought one as a gift for my sister and another for my mom despite a better, new recommendation from CooksIllustrated."
1,Disappointing,"I found that fastening on the front component came unglued very quickly and rendered the item useless. Otherwise, this would have been ideal, as it fits well in my hand and does the job easily-- it was also pretty easy to clean."
4,"Works very well, but I'm still peeling my garlic first","It's a very good garlic press, but I don't think it does that great a job with unpeeled garlic as I have read in other reviews. I'll still peel it first."
1,Broke after a year of normal use,"My husband loved this garlic press, until the holey part the garlic comes through popped out while he was using it. Time to find another garlic press."
3,Harder to squeeze..,"I have the older version of this model. The new model is much harder to squeeze. Not quite sure why, maybe the holes are sharper in the old version. I love the size of the new press, wish it wasn't so hard to press."
3,"Decent, but not great","I bought this press a couple months back based on reviews and brand. We own a couple other Zyliss products (parm. cheese grater and can opener are a couple) that have held up well, and are great products in design and ease of use. While this press does accommodate larger cloves (or multiple) and does in fact press garlic, I found that it was hard to use. The pressure/strength needed to actually press the garlic was above and beyond what my kitchen skills were up to. I asked my husband, and he agreed it seemed exceptionally hard to press. We've had a couple other presses (one generic, one pampered chef) that also pressed well and didn't require the same sort of exertion. I've finally given up on it, and gone with a more ergonomically designed one I picked up at target (the michael graves one)."
3,Finish peeling off,I bought this based on so many good reviews on the web. What I don't like about this is that the finish is peeling off the press and I've always taken care to wash by hand. Now I'll have to get a new one.
5,Performance of Zyliss garlic press,"This product was highly rated by Cooks Illustrated and since the previous garlic press I owned was virtually useless, I decided to spend the money and order this, and it has lived up to its rating. There still is some waste from the outer skin, but it is sooooooooooooo much better than what I had before."
2,Disappointed......,"I had heard great things about the Zyliss presses, but although this press works great, it is not stainless steel. Nor, apparently, is it solid aluminum either. About a year after using it, I started to notice little flecks of silver paint coming off in my garlic. Apparently there is some kind of finish on the aluminum, or maybe it is an aluminum coating that is coming off. Regardless, as soon as I noticed that, I tossed it in the trash and ordered a Rosle. Significantly pricier, but stainless steel and the tool of many a professional chef, it will likely be around for a long time."
4,Regular use for 3 months and still going well.,"My last press lasted for about 7 or 8 years. So far, I'm happy with this one. I even use to help chop ginger.I don't particularly like the small poker for the holes. It works well, but ours got lost down the disposal and came out all chewed up.But the press still works well and cleans well."
5,BEST Garlic Press Ever!,"I've had this one for several years now and bought one as a house-warming gift recently, too. I also find it great to crush other items like peppercorns, Chinese herbal tablets (too hard to chew and must be crushed to take). I use this DAILY and find it the perfect garlic press and so DEPENDABLE and easy clean-up!!!"
3,Difficult to use,"I bought this press hoping it would be easier to use than our current one, but sadly it is much more difficult. If there is more than one clove of garlic in it, I can't compress it at all - my husband has to do it. While I like the included cleaner, the press is useless to me unless my husband is home and I am not exactly lacking in arm strength. I think if the press were made of a heavy metal instead of a cheap plastic it would probably be better. I am sticking with my Oxo Steel."
1,"Aluminum Peels Off, Food Discolored","This thing has a coating that peels off and gets into your food. When you put it in the dishwasher, it oxidizes, and you get grey aluminum powder on the garlic. Unacceptable."
2,Much too hard to press,"I had an older, small Zyliss press that worked just fine but finally gave up the ghost. Ordered this based on the great reviews (crossed my fingers and ignored the few not so great reviews). I am a woman with average hands and strength (please don't ask me to define average), but pressing a clove of garlic through this thing was a real workout. First, it is a rather large press so getting your hand(s) around it for good leverage is a stretch. I tried it with peeled and unpeeled garlic. I snipped off the garlic tips. I cut the garlic in half. I put only one clove in at a time. Still, it required a huge effort for me to press the garlic through. Called my husband and, although he could manage it, he, too, thought it was much too hard and uncomfortable to deal with. Not sure why there is such a difference of opinion on how easy/tough this is to use, but I am going to purchase something smaller and hope for the best."
3,$16.95 and the silver finish is wearing off after one month,"I'm not crazy about this product though it gets top marks by reviewers and is used on America's Test kitchen. It is a lighter weight material than my old solid steel one so it is much easier to use. From using it, I do believe it is a better garlic press than the OXO design. It DOES work.On April 5, 2007. I noticed that the silver finish is coming off on the inside areas where the garlic is pressed and on the actual part that presses on the garlic. This seems dangerous."
1,Too Fragile,"Got this for my Thai wife who uses a lot of garlic in her cooking. She didn't have big enough hands, or the hand strength to use it. It takes a lot of strength, using both hands, to get this to work because the holes the garlic is pushed through are very small. Using unpeeled garlic isn't recommended because most of it gets pushed up instead of down because the small holes clog quickly. It failed completely, after about 1 month of use, when I put about 3 cloves of garlic in, gave it a pretty good squeeze and the entire bottom plate with the holes separated from the rest of the press. When I buy a new press I will look for something sturdier."
2,** wrist strap already included in Camera,"8"" wrist strap is already included in the Leica D-Lux 3 package. The one comes in the camera box is more comfortable to use."
2,meh,Interesting at first. But this series really gets kind of boring and annoying later on in it. Definitly dont watch with kids. Has nudity and cussing in it. I would probably just watch jericho instead of this.
4,Good Sci-Fi fair,"When the series originally ran on the showtime network, I was only able to watch the pilot, for some reason. I really got into the show by watching the pilot movie, and really wanted to see the rest of the series. This Box-set is the perfect way to view the season in it's entirty.The series itself is a mix of a couple series that have come before it. It has elements of firefly, stargate sg-1, dark angel, and Mad Max, but adds its own originally to it. But the one downside that I have found of this series is that a few people (at least in my group of friend) cannot stand Luke Perry, and if that is you, you should not even try to watch this, because no matter what anybody tells you this is definatly Luke Perry's show."
1,Sorry folks this one is BAD,"I tried to sit through Season 1 of this and could not make it past episode 4. An intriguing story but way too many plot holes(clean teeth, clothes, everybody looks healthy??).The action/fight sequences are so poorly done they remind me of those horrible low budget movies the sci-fi channel pumps out. The acting by the two main stars is ok but everyone else is terrible. Its a shame because I really wanted to like this and I loved Jericho and other well made shows like Farscape and Firefly. Jeremiah has a very low budget feel and look. The occasional swear word and brief nudity seem completely out of place too. Im sorry but I cannot rate this show as high quality."
2,Downhill From Episode 1,"i saw epsisode one and either it was really good or it caught me at a bad time as what I enjoyed from episode 1 went quickly downhill, primarily from a lot of bad acting. Perry poses more than usual and is super-broody throughout. Former cast members of 90210 come in for a few episodes, but quickly turned me off with a graphic and long rape scene.I could see how the concept has a lot of promise as, after all, it's what drew me to purchase season 1. However, each progressive episode got a little worse and I stopped watching midway through the series. Maybe it got better, I don't know but I doubt it seeing as how the series was terminated."
2,Slow time,"Jeremiah is a caracter of belgian creators with a lot of limitations. In television we hear a lot of talk, a lot of lost philosophy, but little action and an indecision that tend to be mathemathicaly sytematic (like a desease) in the protagonist. Well, with basis on comics full of action we face pictures full of talk, cheap talk, probably for certain kind of people that without reading any book of Nietsch, Sartre, Kirkgaard or Plato, they fill full with this pansophy. An alternative series could be imagined and realized in a best way. This is what I think here in the city of Lisbon, in Europe."
1,Knock-off of a knock-off....,"Saw the knock-off series ""Jeremiah"" when it was the classic Star Trek episode ""Miri"", in which all the adults past puberty were killed by a virus originally meant to prolong life. Also saw it as the Canadian TV series ""The Tribe"", in which all the adults are killed by some sort of plague. Also read it in ""The Kindling"", by Jennifer Armstrong, a novel in which teenagers must care for the younger kids after a virus wipes out their memories and kills all adults.I laughed when the Amazon reviewer called the premise of ""Jeremiah"" ""intriguing"".Well, the other works don't have Luke Perry or pretty F/X. Maybe that's the ""intriguing"" part of this latest adaptation of one of the most overused themes in Science Fiction."
5,great watch,"good seller, great seller. The Bulova watch is usually expensive but this one was cheap. It's kinda comparable to the expensive ones like tissot desire or movados, etc. great watch"
5,nice one,"it's a cute, thin mat. My previous mat has a very strong smell, this one doesn't (actually, when you open first it has, just need to leave it unrolled for a while). Color is nice and it's not slippery."
3,Expensive,"Mat is OK, after purchasing this found lots of other mats in the stores with same or better quality for lesser price."
3,Pretty Design but Not the Best You Can Get,"Pros:- Gaiam offers very pretty designs on their mats.- Easy to roll up and store.- Can be cleaned easily.Cons:- Not thick.- Has plastic-y/rubbery smell.- Not the most eco-friendly mat out there.Conclusion: It's great if you want to throw it down over a tile or hardwood floor to do quick sit-ups, cardio, etc. However, as some other reviewers have pointed out, it has a smell and is thin so it's not so great for yoga (you can definitely feel the floor) or anything that you have to do that would put your nose inches from the mat (push-ups)."
2,Thin but good grip,"This mat was very very thin. Much thinner than I had expected or any other at I had had before. It does have a good grip, however it is not comfortable and the design isn't really that great. If you are looking to spend 20-30 dollars on a mat, I would go for the $28 standard mat at lululemon. Much better use of your money."
4,"Trendy, attractive & useful",Good looking yoga mat. It did smell strongly of chemically like fumes but we aired out on the patio & it'd dissipated in 24 hours. I use it for yoga & my very masculine husbands uses it for stretches before his own work out routine. I love the color. Petite - it's easy to roll up & stash under the den's couch!
2,not that great,this product is alright in material but the thing to take note is its terrible odor when you first open it and the odor sticks for a very long time. Don't get if you can't tolerate smelly things. It's barely tolerable. With yoga in certain positions you are close to the mat and I had to smell it. So I end up throwing it out.
1,bruised knees,"The yoga mat was advertised as ""extra thick."" I was VERY disappointed as it is actually very THIN. Might work on top of nice thick carpet, but not on wood floors - almost instant knee pain. It was pretty though."
2,THE COLLECTION HAS 3 DVD'S BUT ONLY SEEN ONE (1),"THE DVD NO. 1 - MADAGASCAR 1 NOT SEEN, SHOWS ERROR READING, INDICATES THAT THE REGION IS INCORRECT IN TV, EQUAL TO THE PENGUINS OF MADAGASCAR.BUT MADAGASCAR 2 IS GOOD, WE CAN SEE THE MOVIE."
5,Madagascar Collection,My grandchildren love watching these movies! My daughter said they are a big hit and the kids sing the songs long after the DVD is finished. What else matters?
2,You do not get all that you pay for!!,This set does NOT include the Penguin Christmas Caper even though it says that it does on the DVD package. NOT a happy camper!
3,Not Complete,"Ok so of course all the movies are great. Good DVDs for kids. But this isnt the complete collection now is it? Theres a third madagascar now. The lesson, dont put complete on anything until you are sure that there will never be a sequel. Just wait a decade then release a remastered complete collection with bonus material."
1,Missing Christmas Capers Short on Disc 1,"I'm super annoyed. I bought this set from Amazon and disc #1 is missing the Christmas Capers short even though it is advertised on the case. Amazon was great about sending me a replacement, but the replacement is missing it too. I did some web searching and finally found 2 other people with the same problem. At this point I still don't know how to get the correct disc since Dreamworks doesn't have a customer service line and I don't know what else Amazon can do."
1,"Missing ""Christmas Caper""","Like M. Stanton, my copy of this collection is missing the ""Christmas Caper"" short on the Madagascar disc. The packaging for the disc says it's included, but it's nowhere to be found. Amazon sent me a replacement, but it was still the incorrect version. I have no idea how to contact Dreamworks about a replacement."
1,Madagascar: The Complete Collection,I rated this high because the nephew I purchased it for told me that he had put it on his list to Santa Claus. I'm really not knowledgable about the content but his mother okayed my getting it for him. The same is true for the Mario DS purchase.
5,Movies,"This is one of the funniest movie franchises out there. Good casting and ideologue, but the penguins are my favorite in the movies. Can’t wait to see what part 4 is going to be about."
5,Madagascar is fun for kids!,"This was a great deal for the money! We were not familiar with the movies but our grandchildren (ages 2 and 1) love the characters and the fun they have. The story lines actually have a little moral to them also, which is a plus."
4,Kids Love it.,"Madagascar 2 is a little bit more intense than the first for my sensitive daughter, but both kids (4.5 and 7) loved both movies and the penguins are always funny. It was a great buy to get them ready to see Madagascar 3 in the theaters and they had a great time with all of them."
4,A good Pick,This underground band has a good and lasting sound that I/m sure with enough exposure will soon be on everyone's to get list.
5,Actors Studio member recommends Hull book,"This book lays out an entire course of training exercises in the most explicit, practical, down-to-earth manner I've ever encountered. It is of enormous value to actors, directors and especially to those who teach these disciplines. Susan Strasberg wrote in the foreword: ""When I read Lorrie Hull's book, I thought, 'My God, she's done it! She's caught so much of the work.' She got the answers, wrote them down, used them in her own twelve years of teaching for my father and then translated it all into an understandable, explicit, practical book that offers valuable tools for any actor [beginner or professional], as well as for writers, directors, and teachers. I'm sure a lot of misconceptions about my father's work will be cleared up by this book. After reading ""Strasberg's Method,"" I feel sure that my father, 'Pop,' wherever he is, would be enormously pleased."""
5,Books for the Actor's Library,"We were recently referred to this excellent book and have been using exercises from the book in our advanced acting program at The Actor's Workshop-Detroit in Royal Oak, Michigan, with good results."
4,Explosive Ending,"It definitly helps to do some bible pre-reading before reading this book. I was assigned to it for class and never would have read it otherwise. However, the ending made the rest of the book worthwhile. The main character, John, finds God. I did some research on James Baldwin and found that this book is largely autobiographical. I think the author may have actually experienced a ""calling to God"" as John did, because it was wrote so incredibly well that you could imagine and feel John's feelings as if you were feeling them yourself. Many parts were religious tangents that didn't grab my attention, but for the most part, the book gave me an incredible inspirational feeling."
4,God Help Us,"This is a well written story of the lives those working out their salvation amid poverty, hardship and seeking a strong spirituality."
4,Powerful,"I was required to read this book for an English class and I thought that this book was great but the transitions from past to present were not handled well and I would often have to go and re-read the text again to help comprehend the situation. Go Tell it on the Mountain is a wonderful book about self-discovery and familial & religious duty. The characters in this novel are wonderfully full: imperfect, but hopeful. I do disagree with anyone who feels that an extensive knowledge of the Bible is required to appreciate or enjoy this book."
2,Revisery Warning,"Like others have mentioned, this book was over-written and the prose was too lyrical. Some of the descriptive passages and religious mumbo-jumbo were very tiring to get through, and it stalled the little action the novel did have. And in the end, there was a lot Baldwin set up in terms of plot that was left wide open. Especially The Letter (when you read this you'll know what I mean). Why did Baldwin dedicate so much character dialogue to the letter, leading readers to believe the revelation of it would resolve the story, then end things before it was revealed??? WAS it even revealed?This could've easily been a novella, and a good one, if he had revised the manuscript better."
2,Two thumbs up?,"I find it humorous to read all of these reviews and decided to add my tid bit of info. I find Baldwins work in Go Tell It on the Mountain totally directed toward the Christian. Unless you have a superior understanding of his literature, this book is frankly boring."
2,Great start but does not sustain,"Begins as a bildungsroman, and a fine one with beautiful writing. I become less interested when the point of view shifts. An interesting bridge between the Modernist tradition and the African-American style of story-telling (montage of multi-generational, tangentally-related voices and plots) that Morrison embodies. The spiritual crisis that is so important to Baldwin does not capture me."
2,Not enjoyable,"I was really looking forward to reading this book since I knew it had religious overtones. However, the book tried to tie religious feelings with characters that only on the surface appear to be faithful. At least Baldwin created an interesting struggle with faith and temptation. But the whole idea that repetitive sinners contain the Spirit is hypocrisy! These people just go through the motions of a faithful life and therefore, the character descriptions are incorrect."
1,Go Tell It Someway Else,"Go tell it on the mountain was an extremely frustrating book. While the themes and some of the events were good (i.e. racism, abuse, religion), the way it was written made the book unenjoyable for me. I found that the way the book was written made it this way for for others as well. I dont think this is just a coincidence. If the book was written differently I probably would have found it enjoyable."
1,I JUST DIDN'T LIKE IT!!,I was told by my English 1(S) teacher to read the book and I didn't even finish it. I couldn't get into it and what I read of it was stereotypical. Maybe there was something that made the book good at the end. All of my friends will agree that the books wasn't very good!! Who really cares about a preacher that sleeps around? Not me. All of the characters are introduced at the worst times and one can't even remember who the characters are... I just didn't like it (or the first 127 pages I read).
1,not his beat work,i thought this was one of Mr. Baldwin worst works. It was vary hard to read and to follow.
1,The most boring book I have ever been assigned to read,"I was assigned to read this book for my English class and I thought that it was incredibly boring. I didnt like anything that was in the book, and as a result, I found it incredibly hard to read. I cant believe that people can enjoy this book. I hope that I never have to read a book like this again becuase it was too long, and extremely boring. It put me too sleep half the time I tried reading it, and I would recommend to anyone that has not read this book never to read it, because it really is the worst book I have ever read."
2,"This Book was excellently written, but hard to follow.","I am a 10th grader and was required to read this story for English. Although Mr. Baldwin used vivid imigery, it was extremely hard to follow, and seemed to skip around in time a lot. Also, this book was centered to much on Religion, nad not the characters. For anybody who is looking for a easy read this book is not a very good choice. To understand this book, it would be helpful to take your time while reading it and take notes on what you have read."
4,A walk on the dark side,"It's obviously a classic, but the book sometimes gets a bitteadious. The book gives a good view on subjects likeracism, religion and the black community in America.If you're interested in that kind of subjects and if you're determinedenough to get through the book; this is the book for you.Rolf DondersTwikkelstraat 374834 LLBreda- The Netherland"
5,A compelling book on the struggle of a boy's plight for id.,This book simply shows the hardships of African American boys trying to become men. Studying up on Baldwin has also given me a new way of looking at the book as a autobiograpyhy written simply in 3rd person. This is a book I would recommend to people of all races and creeds. Baldwin is simply manificent and should be given much credit for this wonderful book.
4,Required Read,"This was a required read for my daughter's Gen. Ed. English class, but she really enjoyed it. If you like African-American literature then you will like Baldwin's piece. It is very heavy in Biblical allusions, so having a knowledge of the Bible is helpful."
1,WHISTLEBRITCHES,"Russell (Joel Weiss)has a junk food diet that leads to his production of gas which he enjoys to the dismay of everyone around him. While his wife Heather (Shannandoah Sorin) is away, Russell watches TV. The movie consists of a ""Groove Tube"" montage humor involving fart humor. Perhaps the best feature was the ""Gong Show"" parody. Very low brow stuff.Parental guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity."
3,It's a GAS !!!,"A Ray/Migdalia Etheridge comedy.Starring:Joel Weiss,Conrad Brooks,Robert Axelrod and Steven Banks.This is a funny video,That's suited for wild parties and wild viewing by ""The Guys"".Alot of sketch comedy that would later be used in `Saturday Night Live"" and ""SCTV"".The facts and nuances of FARTING and the noises & smells associated with are conjectured and scrutinized.The Etheridges admit this is their best seller on Amazon.com and mostly women buy for their husbands and boyfriends !Its funny,Like we said and has a great cast."
2,Fart the movie,"This movie was a disappointment. It sounded like it would be really funny from the description, but only the first few minutes were good. The farts are not even real. Sound and picture quality are on a very low level, but I don't find that too important."
5,Athens is pure Gold!!!!,"I recently bought Athens 2004 and thought it was fantastic, the gymnastics events looks very realistic, and the fact that you can use the dance mat makes the game even better. This is a perfect game for you to invite your friends over to play! There are loads of events that you have to master, and try to become a gold medalist! The button pushing isn't for the weak fingered, but it's great to watch your friends jumping up and down on the dance mat trying to finish the 100 meters. This game is for the competitive people who want to win and prove to their friends that they are the best! I would recommend this game!"
4,Athens 2004,"I love this game. I have it and play it every chance I get. It would be nice with the improvements for the next Track and Field game to have the 100 and 400 relay races. Or have the competition just like the olympics with heats, semi finals, and finals. However the game is fantastic."
3,Good and bad...,"I've pretty much just played sports games my entire life. I got caught up in the Olympic fever and decided I wanted to have a game for my PS2 (yes, still a PS2-er) that was Olympic-level. This wasn't quite what I expected. Don't get me wrong, this isn't a bad game, it's just not what I was expecting. The furious button pushing was a bit of a problem, since my game-worn fingers tend to give out after pushing for more than a minute straight. I like it, but it's not brilliant."
4,Practice makes perfect,"Practice definitely makes perfect in this game. Due to the way the controls are setup, it makes for an interesting test of finger strength and endurance :). Overall a very enjoyable game. Graphics are pretty good, gameplay is very smooth, etc. I am a huge sports game player, so for me this was a must buy. It adds a level of diversity to my game portfolio :)"
5,A Good Value,"While this title is several years old, it is still a very fun PS2 title. My wife and I rented this for the family and had a blast. While there are many games that require you to hammer buttons, there are also games like archery, the 1500k, pole vauly, gymnastics, horse jumping, shot put (and many more)that require a lot of skill. We found most of the games addictive. Also, with practice you could get better. Archery was awesome! If you are looking for a cheap game that many in your family would like, I recommend this title. We bought it after renting.Some have given this game negative reviews because some events (like swimming and the 400 meter) require you to tap for over a minute. No one can possibly do this and enjoy it. But, and I say BUT, there are too many good events on this title that DO NOT require you to tap for you to pass on it. Ignore the ""tappers"", you will have a blast with the rest."
2,Hand and fingers tire quickly,"I just opened this game and really couldn't play more than half an hour without my fingers tiring of the controls. Almost all of the events use the same rapid succession of the X and O buttons to gain speed. I found it difficult to continually press these buttons and I couldn't compete with the computer athletes in most events. I tried pressing the buttons with my index and second finger instead of just my thumb, but it wasn't much better."
2,My fingers are so tired......,"The game repeatedly asks you to press X and O buttons alternately and endlessly. After 15 minutes of gameplay, my fingers are so tired that I cannot play this game anymore. How could a game company be so careless that it does not consider this factors?The game also suffers from unoriginality. After a while, you will find that the game controls replicate itself throughout all sub-games - pressing X and O repeatedly. How can that be fun?Very-disappointing title. In fact, ESPN International Track and Field has better controls and more interesting."
1,It has more to it if you look for it!!,I really liked Athens 2004 especially the events that do not require button bashing. Check out Gymnastics and High Jump as two examples.We had great fun as a multi player and spoofing it out on the dance mat.
2,great idea...........bad game,"989 sports has all of these great and awseome ideas! They just cant figure out how to put it together.Athens 2004 is a game based on the Olympics (fully liscenced) which includes full rosters for most nations. NOTE: this game does not have basketball, baseball, soccer, etc. This game is for the tracks, shooting, swimming, yeah yeah yeah. The gameplay uses mostly simple combos in order to complete tasks. EX: for tracks, you push o and x over and over until you get so sick you will have lepricies. You could put the biggest battery over the buttons and still lose to the computer.Overall, if you enjoy the Olympics either(A) Actually play them(B) Go and watch them, or (C)Go back to gym class."
1,Don't Waste your Money,"This game is TERRIBLE!!! What a waste of $$$. Rent this game before you buy and save yourself the $$$$. You Won't buy it! Don't make the same mistake that I made.I took a chance with this game because it is the ""Official Video Game of the Olympics""....it is obvious that no one played it before they endorsed it. This game does not require skill....just the ability to click XYXYXY...as fast as you can to speed up...whipee.This is the WORST game I have seen for PS2!!!!"
1,disappointed,"I bought this expecting it to contain tons of Americana classics, but I don't even know the half of these songs. Looks like obscure 70s music for those who didn't listen to rock n roll back then. I have no idea what to do with this. Perhaps donate it to the local retirement village?"
3,Better than most pastiches,"This was very good, very thoughtful - I liked the way it started out. He did not however, fulfill most of his promises, really give us the conclusion that we hoped for - if you like Sherlock Holmes' pastiches, you will like this. If you like mysteries, this will come over as a little flat."
3,"Interesting, but not echt Holmes","I would agree entirely with the reader who made the statement regarding modern language and the Abigail Masterson character being too modern as well (other revisionist text is sprinkled here and there). Furthermore, Holmes and Watson are much too emotional to stand with the more faithful pastiches of Doyle's characters; obviously, they were made to be more 'human', but something was lost in the process. This is not the familiar Holmes and Watson of yore. The setting is right but sadly the anachronisms were jarring to me; a case of the author wanting to have his cake and eat it, too."
1,Another disappointed reader,"I won't repeat what other reviewers have written, but I was very disappointed in this book. Since it was marketed to Sherlock Holmes readers, I expected some resemblance between the plot / characters and the original Doyle works. Instead, I got overblown horror, a romance for Holmes, artificial dialogue, and basically a run of the mill horror story into which two unrecognizable characters named Holmes and Watson have been inserted. It might have been an OK horror book on its own, but it's misleading to market this book as any kind of continuation of or homage to the Sherlock Holmes series."
2,Not a true Holmes book,"If it were any other detective, especially a hard-boiled one, it would work. Since it's Holmes we're having tortured in the first half of the book, it doesn't really work. The language is too modern and while I like Abigail's character, she's too modern also. In short, read Worcester's book first before you buy this. ......................."
3,"Not bad, but could be better","A fairly interesting story that's made less effective by the all-too-modern dialog that the author puts in the mouths of Holmes and Watson. He builds a believable image of this hidden horror lurking among London's upper class, and then shatters the mood with a line that would be more at home in Magnum P.I. than Sherlock Holmes. Maybe he was trying for an edgy, unvarnished tale, but it really doesn't work for me. There are a few other lapses, some already noted in other reviews, but this was one that kept bugging me. With some more work on this aspect of his storytelling, however, the authors future stories should be quite enjoyable.-Bryan"
3,Not like the trailer,"From the trailer I was expecting an in-depth into why children can see 'ghosts' and adults can't and was eagerly awaiting the video. But, it wasn't anything like I expected. It's not necessarily a bad movie and it has a few shocks and scares but it's nothing too great. I would recommend watching it once if you like horror movies. But it's just like all the other horror movies that are being made today."
4,Pervasive sense of dread,"It's true that the plot has derivative elements: most noticibly a scene right out of Hitchcock's The Birds, but this film, directed by Daniel and Oxide Pang, will give you chills and keep you engrossed in its somewhat familiar plot (big city family moves to a farm that holds horrible secrets, the children are the first to hone in on the horror). The Pang brothers bring a smart and decidedly creepy sensibility to the film and it's what we don't see that's truly terrifying (or, I suppose, what we glimpse peripherally). The atmosphere of this film is one of dread and The Messengers is a solid horror movie with engaging characters you'll come to care about quickly and completely. The casting of John Corbett against type was also a refreshing surprise. From someone who reads a lot of horror and has been watching horror movies since I was a boy, this one held my interest and, more importantly, made my skin crawl and pulse race."
4,Creepy,"This horror flick did what it was supposed to do; it creeped me out. I wasn't certain just how it was going to end, but liked how they decided to twist it. When a family moves into a run down farmhouse they're expecting hardships, but not ghosts. It turns out this one has more than a few 'skeletons in the closet'.Chrissy K. McVay - Author"
4,GOOD SUSPENSE THRILLER!,"THE MESSENGERS WAS A TRULY ENTERTAINING, AND AT TIMES, SUSPENSEFUL FILM!THE ACTING WAS PRETTY MEDIOCRE, BUT FOR A SIMPLE GHOST/HAUNTING STORY...CHECK IT OUT!FOR THE MOST PART...IT WAS PRETTY GOOD!IF YOU LIKE THIS, I ALSO RECOMMEND DARKNESS AND DARK WATERS!"
3,Not a bad movie,"If you can get it on sale, or perhaps in a double pack, then go for it. It is pretty creepy."
3,"Good, but nothing new...","Was not a bad movie at all...it actually had a nice plot, pretty good acting, and good directing. However, what makes this a just ok movie is the fact that it was nothing new. The plot was not at all unique.Story is about this family who goes out to live in North Dakota in a house that holds secrets. The teenage girl begins to feel awkward about the house. She begins to see images that hint that something happened in that house. The only other person who sees these images is her younger brother Ben. The problem is, Ben is about 2 years old and cant talk. It is up to her to find out what happened in that house before her family suffers the same consequences.Good characters. Good acting. Good images. Good story.But again, it was very predictable because theres about 15 other films that have the same plot. So, it really wasnt anything new.I recommend it if you are into horror films, because it is an ok movie. But, dont expect anything great."
3,Wasn't that great.,"The movie is about murdered family members from the past. Their ghoulish presence still occupy an old farm house that a new family has just recently moved in to. Unbeknownst to the adults, the children seem to be harassed, and perhaps warned by the spirits. That's the gist of the story I got from watching it. Besides the very minimal ugly antics to scare viewers, the movie didn't make a lot of sense. For example, what was the crows all about? It also lacked originality as there were too many cliches from several other movies rolled into one. The acting was good, but I just didn't think the overall movie was that great."
5,Awesome,I think Kristen Stewart is good in this movie- she plays a very good character and had me scared :)
2,Stone the crows!,"Sadly, this is about as derivative as it gets. Every haunted house cliché is dragged out along with a bit of The Birds and The Shining thrown in just for good measure. There are some genuinely creepy moments along the way but the formula is so tired and predictable that these moments are not enough to save the movie. Kirsten Stewart does a reasonable job of carrying the story along but the entire cast clearly lack conviction, and this lack of belief diminishes the film even more."
4,Predictable But Well Acted,"I liked this movie alot because of the actors and the suspense elements but the storyline was way to predictable and obvious, but every movie has been like that for me but if you like suspense and scares this is a great film!"
3,"Nice movie, but same story",The movie is nicely produced but the story is used a lot (dead people trying to revenge) ...
2,Shallow and weak!,Typical cliche' movie. Hollywood has a -one size fits all- movie script which the only thing they change are the names and locations. Overall: BAAAAAAAD!!!!!!
2,OK Ghost Story,"I had high hope for this one, but it disappointed me. Not much of a plot. Dragged out. Things that go bump in the night over and over again.It was OK, but I can't really recommend it. But I'll give it two stars because I have seen a lot worse."
2,SLICK PRODUCTION * ROUTINE STORY 1 1/2 STARS,"'The Messengers' is a film that tries very hard to be a good horror film but fails. The production is good quality but, the story and jolt tricks are very tired. This film tries to scare you with a lot of quick, loud flashes of creepy figures and shadows......it doesn't work, at least not on me. You can achieve this type of scare in your own home by putting on a blindfold and walking around a room full of set mouse traps scattered on your floor! Over all the film has fair acting and FX but, it's the same old song and dance....my friend! Maybe a rental??"
3,Average at best...,"This movie has received lots of reviews already. I am just throwing my two cents in to say that I agree! The one bright spot was Kristen Stewart. I hope that she does not get typecast as the dour rebel chick, but she did her job well in this film. The only problem was that she is acting a role that has been done so many times before that we are numb to the suspense of the situation presented.With that said, I know that they can't all be home runs, so I would recommend this movie for rental night (assuming you've seen all the other movies on the shelf). You won't have to worry about spilling the popcorn... :)All the best,Jay"
3,Good Movie,"Enjoyable movie with quite a few suspenful moments. As another reviewer said, this is Hitchcock's crows + The Grudge's ghost + Amytiville storyline. There are a few things that are left unexplained and there could have been more scares, but it is a good movie. This is not one of Corbett's best acting but Kristen Stewart did a decent job. It is well acted but the suspenful movies are not that ""suspenful""."
2,not good enough,don't spend a lot of money or effort to see this one. just your average run of the mill scary movie. always better on blu-ray though.
4,KRISTEN STEWART nails it again!,"Kristen Stewart gives a really incredible performance. She's got some serious acting chops regardless of her youth. I believe she was 15-16 when she filmed this movie. Her eyes and face truly expressed her horror, anger and isolation as the script dictated. Wow. If you're a fan of K. Stew, you must see this film. The DVD also has nice extras that feature her...John Corbett was outstanding, as were the rest of the cast. The Pang brothers really know how to make a movie creepy. I was in a state of suspense throughout the movie. I loved it, can't wait for my copy to come in the mail from Amazon!"
1,Stupid Horror Flick!!,"It was a great flick until that handyman regains his memory...It turns out that he murdered his family, got amnesia and the ghosts in the house wanted revenge...utterly a waste of time!!I WANT MY MONEY BACK!"
1,Warning for movies with digital copies,"Warning!!! Most movies that come with a digital copy have a redemption expiration date for the digital copy. Amazon does not list this expiration date, or inform you whether or not the expiration date has already past. The movie is average. I would give it 3 stars if not upset over the expiration date omission."
2,Choose One from Column A....,"The sort of thriller more likely to lull you to sleep than jolt you awake, THE MESSENGERS takes elements from many, many, many films you've seen before, throws 'em in the mixmaster, and gives you ample opportunity during its interminable running time to ponder just how much better all those other films were. And if the males in the cast could manage to deliver lines without hemming, hawing, adding grunts and interjections, and generally dawdling along in a fruitless attempt to make their stilted dialogue sound believable, the film could've shaved off fifteen minutes of dead (would-be dramatic) air. Handsome photography, nice production design and a fine performance from Kristen Stewart can't do much to salvage this snoozer."
2,Let me be a Messenger: DON'T WATCH THIS MOVIE!,"You'll need two cans of air freshener to neutralize the stench of this stinkeroo, which has to be one of the dumbest horror flicks I have ever seen.(P.S. Dude, the stuff with the marauding birds has already been done. His name was Hitchcock.)Find another way to spend 90 minutes of your life. The biggest horror to this movie would be in wasting any more time watching it."
3,movie when a stranger calls,movie looks like a copy of a copy...but its ok for the pricethe cover however its in bad shape
4,"""I see dead people crawling the ceiling""","Watch this movie for it's entertaining, creepy vibe. I loved J Corbett and Kristen S. The little boy was adorable. Even cigarrette smoking man makes a cameo! The editing is great, the photography is eerily beautiful and the birds are a hoot! Watch it with the commentary, it's hilarious."
1,The Messengers DVD,The DVD does not work. I have several DVD players and it would not work in any of them. It started to run in one of them but froze after only playing a few minutes. I wouldn't recommend this seller to anyone.
3,Crazy Crows!,"3 of 5 stars for the suspense movie The Messengers. A family moves from civilization to the middle-of-no-where into an obviously haunted house about two steps better than the Addams Family house. We have an unbalanced daughter and a baby brother who ""sees things"". The house is part of a Sunflower farm. We hire a farm hand to help our family. Strange things start to happen specially with the local crow population. I won't spoil the suspense elements of the movie. Of course, had it been me, I'd never have moved into the house in the first place. This is a well made suspense movie with really odd things happening. Good suspense music. Good plot and well acted. I do recommend this movie."
3,The Shining meets Field of Dreams (well...sorta.),"My family who is always looking for acceptably good horror didn't like this much, as it was too much like theThe GrudgeandBoogeyman (Special Edition).While, I am not so big on horror as they are, and I did see the similarities, I saw it as more similar toThe Shining (Two-Disc Special Edition)with the ghost of the past, causing havoc on an otherwise normally troubled family fallen on hard times.I felt like there is plenty of tension, plenty of little scares, and it is just creepy enough and not leave you feeling dirty. While some of the parts don't completely make sense, I can't think of a horror movie where they do. So....If you are in the mood for a scary movie, that isn't all ""slasher"" or sexual, this is a pretty good PG scare fest.2 *"
3,messengers,"The movie Messengers was predictable, which made it not very scarey.You figure out the ending long before it ends and that ruins the movie. BP"
3,Okay.. for a poor American horror,"Once again, America has pushed out another horror movie that seems like a mixture of a million others. I was able to guess the ending before the movie hit the half mark!! What the hell? It's okay, but not worth the money, really, unless you only have to pay a few bucks."
3,Not a bad movie,"Let's be honest, this movie is a bit predictable and yes even cliche. Having said that I still enjoyed it; there are a couple of great ""gotcha"" moments and overall I thought it was worth watching."
3,"Nothing Original, but well executed","This is a haunted house story, plain and simple - but it's refreshing to see one with a decent cast and so well executed. The story is nothing new - family from the city move to country to escape their family problems... house they get turns out to have a past, and may be haunted.There are no big gore moments, but plenty of atmosphere created by carefully NOT showing you everything for much of the movie, so that when something is seen, the effect is maximized. The ending is not much of a surprise, but the tension mounts thanks in particular to a good turn from Kristen Stewart as Jess, the teenager.All in all, quite routine, but efficient enough to be worth a watch if you like the haunted house genre."
3,Already saw this...,"I saw this movie a few years ago, only it had a different name...The Grudge. It sucked then and it sucks now. I turned this movie off not even half way in, I'm sure it's good towards the end, but I just couldn't take it anymore. Everything done in this movie is an exact replica of the following movies: Dark Water, The Grudges, Pulse and The Rings. If you've seen one of those, you've seen them all. Enough said. Read a book instead of watching this garbage."
1,A Box Of Stupid,This movie did have some good effects but that's it and doesn't it say it all when the best actor is like the two year old boy? All the other people in the movie you could tell they were acting. Really a stupid movie. Isn't worth more than 2 cents!
5,Most excellent,"What a great value! You get Half-life 2, Episode-2, Portal and Team Fortress 2. Team Fortress is excellent fun and well done. The Half-life episode is nice but a bit short. Portal is cool, different and good for some short play sessions when you don't have time for a full game, just do a puzzle or two. I'd give this 6 stars if I could!"
5,Completely Happy,"This game is worth the money paid for it. Portal was definitely fun, and the half life 2 episode 2 contains a good amount of playtime. I try to gauge a games worth based of amount of game time versus cost, and this is up there with the best."
1,WARNING: Won't Install Without Internet ON,"WARNING: Don't buy this game unless you don't have a problem with the fact that you MUST be connected to the Internet to even install the game. If you're one of those people who have anti-virus software running at the same time, also forget it, as you will most likely be unable to find any but the least secure settings that will allow it to work.If your PC is already part of the worldwide spammers botnet, then OK, I guess. But I strongly advise against it for anyone with any computer equipment you actually care about keeping virus or malware-free.It's positively unconscionable to think there's anything even remotely OK about connecting to the sign-up website Steam just to run this game, after buying the game in a store. No wonder colleges have so much trouble allowing returning students to plug their laptops into the college networks without infecting their networks with so many viruses and malware it's not EVEN funny anymore."
1,Computer Cant Run Any Games,"I bought The Orange Box just so I could play Portal. I got Portal 2 and loved it. I have a Mac and a PC. I cant play The Orange Box on my Mac, so I got it for my PC. First of all, I decided to install all 5 games for my PC. Big mistake. I sat at my computer for 2 hours. And I have a great system. Then, I had to set up some software called STEAM. It SEEMED to work fine. So finally, I clicked PLAY PORTAL. It started loading... and then crashed. It said something about a JAVA error, even though I have the latest version of JAVA, and crashed. I spent another 5 hours trying to get Portal to load. I tried to play Half-Life 2 ant Team Fortress. No luck. And finally, I tried STEAM SUPPORT. It said useless stuff like,""Try to update JAVA"" and,""Re-Install the game."" I spent 2 hours trying to install this! No Way! STEAM is a horrible program, and should just let you download the game!"
5,PC vs. Xbox Platform,"bought this platform because my Xbox 360 is out for ""red ring"" repair. Good deal - HL played well with other Windows apps, not too resource-intensive and loads/quits fairly quickly. Played fine on my lower-end laptop. And I can watch TV and play HL2 simultaneously! hahaPS Xbox repair has taken forever. Xbox customer service gets one star. Should I avoid purchasing 360 games, from now on?"
5,Orange Box is amazing,"Orange Box is absolutely amazing. No game(s) compare. All 3 games and its sub-games are great, great, great. I've had so much fun with friends and going solo playing all games in this deal."
1,"Great Game, Nightmarish Process","Steam is an absolute nightmare. The game ran fine initially. I quit the game and went back to play some more, but Steam found problems with my ""Local Game Files"" and then tried to download the files from Steam-infinitely! I tried to reinstall from dvd and ""Steam servers are too busy, please try again in a few minutes"" during which time the Steam servers were apparently NOT too busy to drop an ad for a new Steam game onto my desktop. Maddening, sbdolutely maddening. If you don't enjoy frustration, buy something else!"
1,"Good Game, Lousy distribution","Give me a freakin break!I go in and buy a box and I want the GAMES not the software to download the game. I should not have to upgrade my line of communication in order to download a game. Also, I should not have to be ONLINE or in ONLINE mode to play a game.The games once downloaded I awesome and I like to play them. But I will *never* buy another Steam/Valve box of download software!Once they go belly up, how do I get to keep my games?Mike"
1,DANGER - Do not buy a used copy! Valve won't transfer licences,"Beware. A lot of people on here selling ""New but opened"" copies of orange box are actually selling registered copes and Valve (in their infinte wisdome) refuse to transfer licences from one customer to another (in violation of the ""First Sale"" doctrine of copyright law).DO NOT BUY a used copy except from an 'authorized valve reseller' (whoever that is, apparently not Amazon, unfortunately)."
5,The best $29.99 I've ever spent.,"Excellent package of games. I fully expected HF2 to rival the original, and it's even better than that first-rate game. I've yet to play Episode 1 and 2, so I still have that to look forward to. Portal was a blast! I've only dinked around with Team Fortress 2, so I can't say much about it. However, with only Portal and HF2 under my belt so far, I can honestly same it's money well spent. Everything has run well on my getting-long-in-the-tooth rig, so even if you don't have a state-of-the-art machine you can still probably handle this collection of games."
5,Awesome !!!,"Half Life 2, Episode 1 and 2, Portal and Team Fortress 2. All truly amazing games especially Portal and TF2.I hope additional Portal maps come out and especially that grenades are available for TF2 at some point. It added flavor to TFC, it would benefit TF2 :DStill, quite all amazing!"
2,Good and Bad,"As always, the half life franchise is great, but I have had a lot of trouble running HL 2 episode one and two. The games have caused inumerable crashes and hang ups during gameplay. I had to shut down every program on my computer in order to run. Never had this problem with Half Life until ""Steam"" became involved. Portal ran fine."
5,Doesn't get much better than Half Life,"I really enjoy playing the Half Life games. They really pull me into the game. I'm on the edge of my seat the whole time. And I find myself jumping every time a 'bad guy' creaps up on me and starts attacking (haha!). A lot of that emotion can be attributed to the soundtrack and acting.As far as the other games, they're not bad...but I mainly bought this pack for the Half Lifes. It was still less than buying just those games separately."
5,Great value,"I haven't played Team Fortress 2 for the sheer fact that it might be too addictive, but HL2, the whole series is taking up enough of my time that I'm falling behind on work and now have to catch up.Also, Portal is AWESOME. You can't go wrong with this package."
3,TF II Dissappointment,"Love Valve Software's stuff. Bought this for TFII. Didn't live up to the hype I thought. Much prefer Quake Wars. HL 2 is (of course) brilliant. Whole package is a great value however, especially if you don't have HL 2."
4,TF2 is the best online game since CS source!,"I got this game for the package, but when I began playing TF2, it was the only game I was playing. This is the most fun and addictive game I had since Counterstrike: Source."
1,Inside an Orange Box: Where to Put Valve and Steam,"I like game software, owning what I purchase. Valve Software and Steam, the internet-based registration process, prevents me from ever buying Halflife anything, anymore.I was one of the few lucky ones to get Steam to work on my PC when I purchased Half-Life 2. But then I realized that I bought a licensing scheme, not a game.Never again, no matter how ""good"" the gameis supposed to be.."
1,The Orange Box crashed our hard drive???,"While playing this video, our laptop stopped working. Were told by Dell Support Tech that the game, because it was written by Atari was not really compatible with Windows.Has anyone else had this experiece?"
2,Another Steam Burn,"Amazed that I had to buy a bunch of games I already own as well as others I do not want in order to get Ep 2 (what a scam). I bought orange retail and while installing/activating through Steam I kept getting server errors and told to try again later. Maybe it's just me but when I lay $50 hard earned dollars down for a game, I want to take it home and play it (after all I own it right? - wrong). Valve's Steam software dictates when I can play. Well, when I finally got Ep 2 up and running (the next day), it was OK - nothing special and certainly not worth $50 (maybe $20) but at least they gave me a bunch of other games I could care less about. I've finally come to the realization that my Steam days are over. Valve's Steam has become more oppressive than the Combine."
1,DONT BUY STEAM GAMES.....EVER!,"Well it loads...and....well u got a crap load of stuff that dosent work! I have bought PORRTAL2 through STEAM.com and also Gmod both from steam.com and...i have this crappy blue error screen! I SPENT $40 ****ING DOLLARS! I AM SOOO MAD AT STEAM! ive got everyone i know to try to fix it....THANKS ALOT, STEAM YOU JUST WAISTED MY TIME AND MONEY! YOU PROBALY JUST SCAMMED ME! IT TOOK 5 HOURS IN ALL TO DOWNLOAD! and $40.00 SO FORGET ABOUT MY BUSINESS WITH YOU, STEAM!so if you want this game...JUST DONT BUY IT its a good game but it crashes you PC so now i can't do anything i want to do!steam-steam is a game engine that scamms people for their money just to have fun..AND THEY DONT EVEN GIVE REFUNDS!"
2,Half Life 2 is a Bore,"Half Life 2 is probably the most boring game I have ever played. Team Fortress 2 is kind of fun, but I don't really play it either. Portal is the only game in this collection worth buying (it's fantastic!), and you can get it for about half the price of the Orange Box.I wouldn't have bought the Orange Box if I hadn't thought Half Life 2 was a game I wanted to play..."
1,BOYCOTT VALVE AND STEAM NOW!,DO NOT BUY THIS GAME USED (OR AT ALL). VALVE WILL NOT LET YOU INSTALL A USED GAME. BOYCOTT THE GREEDY B******S!
2,Portal: Just not for me,"I was very excited about this game, so many amazing reviews, game of the year, amazing customer reviews. Gotta say, after 10 minutes I dont like Portal, its just not for me. Moving around trying to figure out the little tests and spacial dimensions ugh. I wonder if this is the end of my love of gaming, Peggle, Rockband, and Call of Duty 4, Peggle, all great games this year, but I just cant get into Portal."
1,Do NOT buy this used!!!!!!!,"There is NO REASON this game should be sold here used. You ABSOLUTELY CANNOT transfer ownership, and the key will not open it if it has been used on Steam. Once that number has been entered on Steam, which is the only way it will run, it becomes invalid. I was ripped off by the Used Book Hounds in Foxboro Mass. DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH THEM.Buy this through Steam for 10 bucks and it is secure and you can use credit cards or Pay Pal."
2,video game,"They need to be more specific as to what operating requirements are needed on the computer in order to run this game. I have had it installed, un installed, re installed by a computer store that built my computer, they say that it should work, but it kills the PC everytime you try to play the game. No one knows why, but I cannot return it, because it's been opened. Not happy."
4,The Orange Box,"The orange box, must have been a mistake. You get five very good games for the price of one. Almost seems too good to be true, but that is what they have done. Do not be disappointed when you play the episode 2 and you think it is to short. Portal and Team Fortress more than make up for this, very good deal and worth the money."
4,Great value,Lots of game for a little money. The Steam install/update can be a little tedious but once done everything works great. I'm running on a 6 year old laptop (w/ Radeon Mobility X600) and it looks and performs great.
2,Meet Satan. His name is Steam,"The Orange Box seems like a tremendous value. The atmosphere and play mechanics of Half Life, the frustrating yet still amusing Portal, and the bash and go Team Fortress 2.But you get another bit of software for free. It's called Steam, and it connects you to the Valve servers. It also needs updating right out of the box, so be prepared for thrills as you sit and wait... and wait...It's default settings have it run on start up, so it sits in your system tray like a barnacle. You have to change settings to get rid of it.Thanks for the great games, Valve. Too bad I have to have steam running to play them."
1,Might be fun if no Steam,"While I know some get tired of people complaining about a game they have not purchased; I think it fair to rate this game poorly as I cannot buy it since it is Steam/Valve. I bought HL2 thru the Steam Download when it came out and I cannot play it as I cannot find my login and password. I was supposed to get Episode 1 for free, but they took so long that I moved on to a new computer and thus lost my links. Valve's support is not good, their servers are slow when they actually work and when you want to play you have to wait hours for the games to 'update'. So I cannot buy nor recommend this software.I wanted to buy it, but when I started reading the reviews to check for DRMs, I saw Steam/Valve has not changed for the better."
4,Bundles... good and pad,"I mostly purchased this bundle for TF2 and Portal. I find those two games to be entertaining and well done. I find HL2, however, to be quite disturbing. I can handle aliens rushing me -- in the dark even -- but, there are just some disturbing scenes of blood and mangled bodies in creepy towns that proves too much for me."
3,"Portal was by fat the funnest, Beware th seller!","Half life is not wat friends made it out to be. Cool game but just anouther shooter but clean graphics. Portal however was worth every penny, Potal 2 is in the works willing to pay 2x for that! Got the game 2nd hand and had to get a crack! Wow finally go legal and still have to crack it? My soul is dea, well it can be done. but if your not a geek beware of used games, some can only be regesterd 1 time."
5,Great Buy,You get 3 games for an awesome price. I bought this for Half-Life 2 and Portal. I am not a big fan of team fortress 2. In any case...I think the Orange box is amazing. The price is definitely worth it for Portal and Half-Life 2.
5,Hard to judge the value of such a big collection of games,"I remember when Half Life 2 came out, the collectors edition was like $90. Now I just purchased the Orange Box on sale for less than half that price. Even if you only enjoy one or two of the games in this collection it is worth the full price. There is no bad game in this collection. I don't know if I would have bought Portal if it hadn't come with the Orange Box, but it's one of the most fun games I've ever played. Half Life 2 and the two episodes represent some of the best single player action gaming in history. Team Fortress 2 I haven't played much, but it seems like a deep and well balanced multiplayer game. All in all, this collection is an obvious purchase for anyone who enjoys games, and it is an immediate ""MUST BUY"" if you haven't played many of Valve's games, because this represents the cream of the crop."
5,Great game,Game is awesome. Just like everyone else says. Well worth the money. I wont ever order a game from Amazon again though as it took 3 weeks for me to get in the mail. I am still venting about that a month later...
3,"Good package of games, but...","Played about half way through Episode 2, nothing new here. Same ole gravity gun, same ole puzzles. Got bored and tried some of the other games. Portal is not easy to figure out or understand. My little one wanted to blast away at something, not possible on this. Heck, even I couldnt figure out what to do in that game. The box comes with no instructions for what to do, only what the keyboard buttons do in each game...thats it. Rather lame.Now, Team Fortress 2 is a fun game to play. I play online everyday with it, its very fun and I enjoy it. So, do you get alot of games for your money? Depends on if you've already bought Episode 1 and 2 like I did. Otherwise, I still say its a worthy investment."
1,Go play Quake Wars!,"This game took 3 years to long. They force you to buy games you already own under the guise that you can give them to a friend. However, they know full and well your friend will want to play what you are playing, so they will end up buying the full box and have games to give away too. Don't waste your time with this overhyped piece of junk."
1,Sent a PIRATED COPY,I ordered this game used from GameUniverse and they sent me a pirated copy in Russian without the code for the internet. Do not buy from this company!!
3,"The weakest of the litter.... Boring, frustrating and BLAND","Yep, I paid the 30 bucks for this thing the second it came out. Finished it in about 5 hours. It is the most disappointing of the series so far by a long shot. I went through twice to see if it was me, or I was missing something. Nope.Yes, there were some new things introduced. A few new characters too. But the story is so incredibly thin and weak, and the action simply stinks, except the final strider battle which is the single most frustrating thing I have ever played. There is simply NO good way to play it at the endThe setup for the next episode is fine, but this episode simply stinks. I love Valve and I happen to be a Steam fan, I buy everything from Steam that they offer that I want to play. But this one, blah....Too bad. I'm looking less and less forward to the next installment."
5,The Cake is a Damn Lie!!!,"The Cake is a lie, but it is delicious, The box set is the best thing to happen to valve since Steam, get play it and eat delicious cake."
1,Prepare to download the game you just bought (borderline consumer deception),There is no mention of how STEAM is REQUIRED to play the game on the box. None. Don't have a fast enough connection? Prepare to wait for the download of the game you purchased. I have never been a PC gamer. I decided to get the 360 controller and this game (due to good reviews). But this whole experience is silly and insulting. Don't buy this (for PC at least). Amazon should at least mention this requirement in the product description.
1,Big Brother,"I wish I had read the bad reviews before waisting my money.Valve is so threatened by hackers stealing their code that they are punishing all the rest of us.Their ""Orwellian"" scheme is to get you to buy the game and then make you agree to a lisence that says you don't own it, even though you paid for it.I have never had a game like this, where I couldn't access the game directly from the disc. It's outrageous that Valve could do this.Do not buy this game. You have to download the game from the internet.It smacks of spyware."
1,Steamy pile of ...,"The games themselves are ok. But the fact that everything is attached to Steam is awful. The worst piece of software I have ever seen. Support does not exist. No phone support at all, email requests been unanswered for over a week and now to top it all the account has been deactivated for no apparent reason. I am doing a chargeback and not buying anything from Valve ever again."
1,Steam Sucks,I bought this because of all the great reveiws and have never been able to play it. I get a screen that tells me its loading and then nothing.
1,region locked,"According to Valve, their games are region locked so make sure you purchase from the same area that you will play in, otherwise your games will be disabled. A copy of the orange box bought in one country will not work in another country since all valve games are verified through steam.My biggest complaint is that no information regarding the region lock is listed on the box itself or on Steam's website. After purchasing a legitimate copy of the orange box while i was in asia, my games disappeared a few days after i had installed and played when i got back to the U.S. Theres no official statement from Valve as of yet and no word from their customer service."
1,Screwed by the Used,"I recently had the experience of buying the Orange Box for PC *and* the original Half-Life 2: Collector's Edition. It's been said before, but it bears saying again that this is the first (and hopefully the last) PC game series I've encountered where I can have the CD keys but it'll keep me locked out of the game installation...because...oops, only one Steam account allowed.Fortunately I only lost maybe six dollars on this, but I think I'm gonna do the world a favor by tossing these games in the landfill rather than send 'em to Goodwill where the cycle of suffering can start again. Let's show these bastards what we think of their ""non-physical"" copies!"
5,Convenient to use and good deal of money,This package is cheaper than buing those games separately. The installer is quite convenient so no further looking for DVDs and hassle with enetering them to the DVD drive is necessary.
1,Warning DRM Locked Game,These games have a DRM system that does not allow you to sell your used game. Do not purchase a used game because you will not be able to activate it. Unfortunately software sellers are not required to post on the outside of their box that the product is locked by a DRM system. If they did I would never buy it. There is one possible workaround if you want to sell your game or purchase a used game. When you first install the game create a unique user ID in the Steam DRM control system. Activate the game play it and when you are ready to sell it give the UserID to the buyer as well. If you want to purchase a used game make sure you get the Steam user ID that goes with it.
1,Unknown Disk errors,"Yep, sure enough I have had this unit over 1 year and nowit rejects 3 out of 5 pre-recorded DVD's saying ""UnknownDisk.""Go Video has since gone out of business, and no longer supportsit's products. The company that bought the name from them saysthey do not support it but they have gotten many calls about theVR3840. It's junk. If you get one that works, give it time."
1,Go Video DVD Player is Junk!,"We bought a Go Video Model VR 3840 from Costco a couple of years ago. It worked good for the first year or so, then started rejecting DVD's with an ""unknown disc"" message. I have tried cleaning the lens, etc., and it will work for a few DVD's, then starts doing the same thing again. After reading many similar reviews, I would definitely not recommend this product, and will never buy another Go Video product myself."
1,The Absolute Worst,"You will regret buying any product with the govideo brand. i have owned two different models of the govideo vcr-dvd combo players and both had fatal vcr head failures within a hours of use. i bought these new, not refurbished from fry's electonics. they would be better known as NO-GOVIDEO."
1,Stay away from go-video,I have had the misfortune of owning several go-video products.I rue the day I bought them and you will too.
1,Don't buy this machine -- you'll be sorry in a few months.,The Go Video VR3840 worked fine for a few months but now it plays some discs while not playing other discs (even ones that it played fine a couple of months ago). It seems the engineers have constructed it just to work well until the warranty is up.
1,No Support by Go Video,"I cannot even get through the Setup mode on the new unit. Their ""Customer Service"" number was disconnected and my e-mail bounced back. Calling the company's headquarter, the recorded voice told me to leave a message, but I always get terminated after that. Don't buy from this company!"
1,It Suuuuuuucks- 3845 unit,"Tried to copy 1 tape to DVD after many (40+/-) played DVD's, it hung up, now won't play ANY dvd or CD! Unknown Disc! GoVideo computer (Customer support) hung up on me 3 times. Nothing in manual about ""Unknown Disc"" at all. Strange we ALL have the same problem and GoVideo has NOTHING on it any where! Methinks something stinks here! (But my air purifier is on and it's obviously covering it up!)"
1,Bad product,"At first I could burn DVDs OK. Then I started losing one in 5 (freeze on recording file, on finalization, etc.). Then 1 in 3. then it stopped recognizing DVDs altogether -- blank DVDs, recorded DVDs, commercial DVDs, whatever. Only CD and VCR functions still work. Since I bought it to transfer VHS to DVD, it's useless to me. GoVideo Customer Service strung me along just long enough for the warranty to expire. BAD PRODUCT; BAD COMPANY."
4,Pleasant Surprise,"After reading some of the negative reviews, I was getting a little concerned that I had made a mistake ordering this product. I'm happy to report that (so far) it's working just great. We're very pleased with the menu structure on the finished DVDs, and the video, while not fabulous, is still very good. Plus, it plays and copies VHS tapes!"
5,delightful!,"TASTE GREAT, LOVE THEM INDIVIDUALLY WRAPPED! GREAT FOR GIFT BASKETS OR A LITTLE TREAT FOR YOURSELF."
1,Do your homework,This product is not one to purchase if trying to save money by not buying the more expensive ones on the market. Its the pads that go with it that you need to price first.
1,Facial Cleansing Massager,"This item is cheap, definitely not the high end massager that it is made to look like. Don't waste your money."
4,Like Nutritioniste just cheaper,"Check the weekend sales papers for coupons. I found a $ 3.50 Dove coupon, which lowered the price to $ 7.35 including taxes at Walmart. It is almost the same as the Nutritionist version, which costs a whopping$ 30+. Mine even came with 12 pillows as opposed to the standard six.It definitely smoothes rough skin, but don't press it too firmly onto your face. If you combine it with the generic brand facial cleaners you can really save suprising amounts of money for literally the same results."
1,Not worth buying,I got this free in a promotion and that's about what it is worth. It is much more convenient to use the cleansing pads by hand rather than with the skinvitalizer. I am really not sure what they purpose they think they are serving with this product. The pads are also more soapy than I would like but that is minor enough since I can just squeeze out the excess.
2,Not the same,Well I purchased this product thinking it would be as good as a Clarisonic. Not even close! The pad was akward as it stuck with velcro and well it just didn't do the job. I eventually purchased the Clarisonic and forgot about this product until I was reviewing my purchases here on Amazon. It must be in the back of the drawer.
2,Disappointed,I was looking for a a very good cleanser and with dove I figured there a good brand . My skin feels the same way as before I cleansed . will not buy again
3,not very exfoliating,its kinda slimy feeling i think you could do more with a scrub than this. i dont use it anymore instead i use the indian clay mask and a deep conditioning cleanser and my face has been amazing!!
2,not worth,"i expected this will do some deep cleaning.but it doesn't.i will not recommend the product, a waste of money.better yet use bare fingers to clean face."
3,cleanser,"it was o.k., for the money.... It does the job..... It was not what I expected, I had one before and it was more sturdy, this one looks like a toy......... but thanks anyway."
2,Not that great,"I essentially love all Dove products, but I was very surprised that I didn't care for this. My biggest problem is the way the thing vibrates while holding it (I know that sounds odd since it's supposed to do that). I just feel it vibrates excessively and it ends up tickling my hands and my face -- I even feel the vibration in my jaw as I'm scrubbing my face and it bugs me enough that I can't use it anymore. So, instead I just don't turn it on."
1,Very poor,"I purchased the Dove Skin Vitalizer on 2/16/09 at Shop Rite for $10.99. This product does not do anything for your shin and it is a waste of money and time. When I went to return it to Shop Rite on 2/23/09, they informed me that the manufacture will not give them credit therefore they can not take it back. Well, Dove, I will not take it for free at this point.And the ONE star is me being kind."
4,review,"I had this last year and it was awesome. Then, one day, I lost it... bummer so i'll buy it again in november (which is right before winter)"
3,my bondage and my boredom,"This book, not in complaint of Frederick Douglass' speech, was fairly boring. Its text is fairly small, and accompanied with approximately standard sized paper size I found I couldn't concentrate on finishing each page. The well educated, more language arts drived people I do reccomend to them buying this book because it is insightful. To you I warn that you should have a high level of concentration on reading and understanding his speech because it was written a long time ago when peoples speech was filled with what we would call grammatical errors(I.E. persons instead of people), which I find completely unnerving and losing my concentration on reading his great and insighful words that played a factor in interracial mingling."
5,In his own words,"This memoir by one of the greatest Americans ever to live is an absolute must-read for anyone who claims to understand -- or want to understand -- what it means to be an American.Douglass uses himself as a metaphor for the profound paradox of a nation that was founded on freedom, but effectively paid for that freedom and thrived due to the labor of people who were not themselves free. This contemporaneous account of some of the nation's most excruciating growing pains is difficult (emotionally) to read, but critical to getting a grip on what the USA is now and from whence we came.This is a powerful, important work."
5,Wow,"I downloaded this to my kindle only because I knew the name from reading about Abraham Lincoln and thought it might be interesting.It went beyond interesting and into the realm of unforgetable.Why wasn't/isn't this book required reading in school?There's not a lot to say, it's a free download for your kindle.. Do it and you'll not regret it."
1,I wouldn't give this clarinet a one star,"I bought this clarinet at the end of May 2006,high school band camp started at the end of July. She started using the Washburn Clarinet at this point. First thing that broke was the ligature, then the keys fell off this happened after only useing for two weeks. We contacted Amazon, but we were past the 30 day return policy. The representative from Amazon was very helpful but unfortunatly they could not find any information on the manufacturer to see if there was a warrenty. A local music store stated this was unrepairable due to the type of screws used to hold the keys in place, it would cost more to repair it then what I paid for it. Please do not buy this Washburn Clarinet it falls apart easily save the money and get something better then this clarinet."
1,Very poor quality,"A family member bought one. On the first try, none of the joints would fit together. Apparently not something they try at the factory. Returned and tried a replacement. The bell couldn't fit onto the lower joint, the ligature screw broke on the first tightening, and it was so far out of adjustment not a single note came out. Buy a used instrument, it will be a better value."
3,So last century!,"Great book, but slowly becoming out of date. Great pictures. Divided into sections which include stillettos and loafers. The more ""modern"" shoes featured are definitely more interesting. Good review of the shoes of last century, not much insight into future design although the last two pages are dedicated to this topic."
1,Rip-Off,"I paid $5.95 for this?? What a rip-off. It's nothing but a very short review, and not very informative. Save your money."
4,A book for everyone ... would that it were read by everyone!,"A fascinating collection of poignant vignettes on being a woman in communist Yugoslavia (with stories of the author's friends and acquaintances in other Eastern European countries.) Ms. Drakulic shares with the West the reasons whereby 40-plus years of communist-engendered habits and viewpoints and tendencies cannot undergo an overnight ""attitude adjustment"". This book is a must for anyone who seeks to begin to sympathize and understand the thoughts and roots of people (especially women) who were born and raised in Eastern Europe. I bulldozed through it, and am now reading her ""Cafe Europa"". Eye-opening!"
2,Great Magazine But . . .,"I really enjoy this magazine . . . when it arrives. The delivery seems sporadic at best, even when you consider it is printed only 7 times yearly.The writing is primarily done by other readers and the articles are well done and entertaining.I bought the magazine directly through the publishers website and the same month I purchased the magazine I began getting expiration notices and offers to renew my subscription.I have had 2 separate subscriptions and neither time have I received all 7 copies."
5,The good old days,"My husband and I have enjoyed going down ""memory lane with our first issue. Has brought back memories I didn't know I had. We especially enjoyed the pictures. I look forward to many more issues of this publication."
4,like this mag,i just wish it didn't take 3 months to start getting them.. seems like that could be better somehow. thanks
4,Good Mag..............,"Just don't click on the ""Free"" mag section ,if you do and don't want to add to your present paid subscription make sure to cancel the other magazine promo ,or they'll send an letter ,etc. to the credit bureas,lol.... Took an few e-mails and days but they eventually figured it out..."
2,9 to 5 beats 10 to LIFE,"No new material from what is already taught in our Re-Entry Program at work. I was looking for something new and innovative. While it touched on most areas we already incorporate, there wasn't anything unique or outstanding in the book."
2,draw real animals,I did not like the author's approach to drawing. She used graphs and I found that to be a little too mechanical for me.
5,Not a masterpiece but definately a great debut/classic,"its 2005, and melodic death metal is pretty much dead.thrash metal faced the same thing by 1992. most of the leaders of the melo-death genre are metalcore/numetal generic bands, leaveing us with generic melo-death clones with no originality whatsoever.so where do you go now?? you go look for the classics.this is a classic. where it all began. it took less than 2 weeks to write this cd, which is amazing since its so great."
2,Where are the Lyrics?,"I've got the cd, but there were no lyrics involved. And the cover of the cd isn't fitting with the cover on teh official In Flames site. There is a cover (a wrong one aswell), and inside the cd there is a picture, but that's it. A pitty, becouse the lyrics are mostly just beautiful! If i had known this, i would have buy this cd somewhere else."
4,"5 stars for each album, 0 for the packaging.","This is a great collection of two great albums from one of the best and most influential of all metal bands, but I have a BIG beef with it: the packaging. The cover just says ""Lunar Strain,"" without a hint of the fact that SUBTERRANEAN is on it, too. Okay, I can deal with that, but come on, NO LYRICS? That is just bad. At least in their earlier days, In Flames wrote some amazing, thought-provoking lyrics, filled with awesome imagery (just read the lyrics to ""Jotun"" and you'll know what I mean), and it's a shame not to have them reprinted in this otherwise delicious little compilation (or at least in the copy that I have - which is by no means a bootleg or anything similar).Oh well, it's still a good collector's item."
1,BOOK OF LIES!!!,"Basically this book ruined the career of a man who basically turned the city of Erie and Mercyhurst Collge around for the good. My father unfortunately grew up with this so called ""author"" and him as well as other members of the community support the man 100%. Before buying this book you need to realize that this book in NOT A TRUE ACCOUNT and needs to be placed in the same category as A Million little Pieces by James Frey. An author lying about something just to sell copies of his book."
5,Fast,The shipping was fast and it was in great condtion. I can't rate the show because it's for my husband and I know nothing about it.
4,Only one thing worge with it.,"I loved this cartoon growing up mostly due my love of science. I do remanded these DVDs to any fan of the show any one who likes science. The only issue I have with this is that the blu-ray has sill never come out, and I no plans on getting any Movie or TV not on Blu-Ray unless it can only be gotten form places like Made to DVD part of places like wbshop.com or disneystore.com"
4,great memorys from my childhood,loved the show and the dvd was fantasticcaptain planet was a great memory from my childhood itmade environmentalism funrecommend getting this dvd
5,Perfect for all!,This is a wonderful show for kids and adults! Kids love the action and imaginative story lines while adults can learn more about saving the environment and being green! It's also gives kids great inspiration to save the planet as well. I loved the show as a kid and I especially loved that green mullet! lol Go Planet!
5,The Power is yours,Love it brings back the best time of my life. Can't wait till the next Season comes out I will buy it
4,Great value at a affordable price,"I was very pleased with the prefomance of this 32"" LCD HDTV. Its everything and more that consumer reports said that it was. If your looking for a LCD Tv for a small area I would suggest this unit. I was very impressed with the easy of use and the quality of picture. I think that once i have my hd dvr hooked up that the sound will be better. Standard difinition on this tv shows up really well."
5,Excellent TV !!,"This TV has an excellent display in SD. I do not have HD yet, but I predict the display will be equally excellent.Menus are a little confusing, a minor inconvenience.My only complaint, no CC on mute option."
2,Speaker feedback squawking sound with low voices/sounds,"Beautiful, breathtaking even, picture. Easy to use remote. Clean, non-glitzy exterior.On day 8, set began to emit an irritating squawk in sync with low tones (voices/sounds). We're not hard of hearing and volume is never above 7-11 range.Our first new TV in 15 years. Sick-to-my-stomach with disappointment!Bought at walk-in store. Wanted to exchange as it's probably a unit speaker issue, but it can't be done due to lack of stock.Glad we didn't buy on-line."
5,movie,it was great movie enjoyed it watch it about 3 times since ive had it so buy it to see if you like it
5,Matthew Kelly - An Inspiring Role Model,"The title may not reveal it, but this book of Matthew Kelly's might make a good graduation gift idea. Especially for a high school student who lacks a little self confidence or remains unsure about their future plans. The Rhythm Of Life has a way of focusing the reader's mind on the things that really matter in life. In the end it will motivate anyone to strive for personal greatness. I found the book to be very insightful and easy to relate to. This is one that is worth reading, discussing and passing on to others."
4,Great Life book!,"Matthew Kelly has a way of saying things that make you want to do them. He really gets you thinking about your every decision, your actions, and where you want to be in life. He's practical, but says those things we need to constantly hear. This is a book you don't read just once, but will reference over and over as you start to live your dreams."
1,Totally debunked.,"This book is, in hindsight, horribly wrong. It is now known that there are no WMD's in Iraq. Saddam did not pose a threat to America and the world at-large. It's just sad that the trumpeters of the Iraqi war were playing to the wrong song. It's packed with faulty and ""highly dubious"" intelligence. The CIA has since admitted as much but I do not expect as much from a hack writting a book to profit from a ""massive intelligence failure""."
1,The greatest threat?,"Weapons of mass destruction are a matter of great concern, yes. The fact that seems to escape the esteemed Mr Butler ... is that the U.S. possesses more of them than any other nation on earth and seems willing to use at the proverbial drop of a hat. ...Richard Butler (who I am ashamed to say comes from my own country) was almost fired by the UN Secretary General Kofi Annan for his disgusting behaviour in Iraq on more than one occasion. He was repeatedly called before his superiors for his lack of restraint and professionalism. Evidence is mounting to support claims that Butler was a U.S./Israeli spy.His total lack of respect for the culture and desire to be in control of UNSCOM teams made him blind to the need to relax/remove sanctions on Iraq. He thus prolonged the misery of a population and should be held partly accountable (along with Clinton, Bush, inter alia) for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of innocent Iraqis. This book is drivel. Propaganda of the worst kind."
1,Dissapointed!,"The picture of the product is not correct. The real product is not of such a sturdy construction. It is not a forged or cast construction, but made fromformed sheet metal.I bought these so I could cut treble hooks (fishing hooks). Well after cutting three 4/0 hooks the jaws show considerable damage, they are not hardened! Cutting the third hook the handles flexed.Will have to get something that works."
1,Bolt cutter? These blow!,I got these to cut apart some wire tomato cages and while I was able to get it to work it was quite the struggle. The handles are to thin. I had a indent in my hand after about the 3rd cage that I was cutting. If the handles were thicker so you can really wrap your hand around it they would work way better. I should have spent the extra 15 bucks and got real bolt cutters.
5,Before NFG and Saves the Day,"When emopunk was actually emo and punk, with good pop writing, there was Samiam. These guys did the whole non-whiny emo thing when grunge was still big, with Jawbreaker, and is one of the few bands from then that's still going strong. This is an album I enjoy very much. That's all I have to say."
1,"Variety, change or sink","why is it that all mens items like bathrobes or pajamas must be of dull colors? Navy, Burgundy, White plaid...etc..etc..How about a Charcoal color bathrobe? or a chocolate or espresso color? or beter yet... a Black one? why mens garments must be square, plain, ""grandpa looking""? I look at any guy's bathrobe and it seems I look sick in any of them. Like I have a cold or the flu... How about deep green, forrest green, electric blueblack and white, ""rad"" monograms etc... spice it up a bit guys!!"
1,Not the correct size for the wb101 shaper cutters.,"I bought this because Freud recommended it for doing raised panel door arches/cathedral tops with their wb101 shaper cutters. Well, it's about a 1/16 of an inch to big. After calling them they explained that it was designed that way to work with templates. Well, that's the lamest excuse I have ever heard. By it being over sized it changes your radius of your templates. They recommended that I take it to a machine shop and have it milled down. I was thinking about doing this, but I have come to the realization that the wb101 kit just really stinks overall at doing raised panel doors... For the first time ever I am extremely disappointed with Freud!"
3,Not for the real marzipan fan,"Wonderful chocolate and an enjoyable bar, but no real marzipan taste. If you're in search of that sweet, strong almond taste like that found in Zentis, these are not for you. However, like I said, these are still good, rich snacks with great dark chocolate."
3,Cool little disc,"Like the Mickey disc, this is a pretty good collection for the Donald beginner. There's a few shorts on here that aren't on the Walt Disney Treasures ""Chronological Donald"" set (namely the shorts after 1941) but seeing as the Treasures series is labeled ""Volume 1"", you may want to hold off."
4,Used DVD in Very Good Shape,"If you love old Disney cartoons, then DVDs in this series are excellent choices. The animation is great--much better than today's sterile look. Since the cartoons are so old (probably from the late 1930s and into the 1940s, the disks produce a grainy picture. But it's not too grainy to detract from the experience, especially if you're watching the cartoons with a little grandchild. I did buy the Classic Cartoon Favorites, Vol. 1 - Starring Mickey, and it was defective. I had to return, but I received a refund."
5,Treasures For Animation Buffs These For Others,"These cartoons are great! I read all these reviews complaining that these cartoons are available on the ""Treasures"", but the truth is these are good DVDs that serve a different function. I own all the ""Treasures"" DVDs because I am a animation fan and I believe all ""hard core"" fans know they need to get the ""Treasures"", but I also own all of the ""Classic Cartoon Favorites"" DVDs. I and my older children (12 and up) watch the ""Treasures"" DVDs and the whole family especially my small children (2 and up) enjoy the ""Classic Cartoon Favorites"". They are both good!!! So if you want disney cartoon classics, but are not ""hare core"" go ahead and buy this video these cartoons are great!"
5,Great fun!,I bought this to share with my grandchildren and it was a big hit. We had a lot of laughs. They loved seeing Donald's nephews and their antics. It is a great addition to our family library.
3,"my kids love this DVD, but the length is too short.","Donald is funny, but this DVD only have 8 episodes, compare other classic cartoon, like Pink Panther or Tom & Jerry, this is too few on one DVD."
2,"Too personal, doesn't count as history","Life in Washington, DC, and how it changed during the years of World War II. Brinkley says in the preface that the book ""is less a work of history than of personal reminiscence and reflection""; I'd go so far as to call it gossip. It's pretty much nothing but a collection of anecdotes, but without an index(!) you can't even go through it looking for anecdotes about any one specific person. Some parts were interesting to read--the stuff about the move to income tax withholding, which I didn't know about before, for instance--but once only at most, no replay value."
5,Santaynrd Has Come to Town!,"Being a Skynyrd fan for over 20 years, I must say this is one Skynyrd CD that came as a big surprise for me. My wife surprised me with it and I had to take a double look at the CD cover. A Skynyrd Christmas CD I asked myself? Very cool, man. I have alot of Christmas CDs. All of those wonderful classics from the 60's and up that I enjoy so much around this time of the year. But it's really great to see a CD from a band that I am such a big fan of put a CD out that have great Christmas classics done Skynyrd style. I put the ""Christmas Time Again"" CD on right away and loved it right from the start. This is going to a rock'n Christmas. Keep rock'n Skynyrd and Merry Christmas! Live to Ride, Ride to Live."
4,Southern Fried Christmas,"I didn't know what to expect from this CD though I thought I would only be playing it during the holidays-wrong! ""Messin' with the kid"" and ""Santa Claus wants some lovin"" as well as ""Skynyrd Family Christmas"" are songs that fit the mood anytime you want to play some Synyrd!.It's good to hear Charlie Daniels Band on this CD as an extra bonus."
3,It's a LITTLE like Skynyrd....,"As has been pointed out ad nauseum, it's not really true LS anyway, so with that in mind-I had heard Run Run Rudolph (ala Chuck Berry) and got my hopes up. Luckily I was able to preview the cd before buying, and thus went the mp3 route and only picked 2 other selections: Santa's Messin and Skynyrd Family, the latter sounding for all the world like Jerry Reed singing (close your eyes and think Amos Moses).For the most part this album is a bizarre mix. Christmas Time Again and Mama's Song are sappy, Greensleeves does NOT belong anywhere in this mix, and Charlie Daniels doing his Elvis impersonation is as bad as .38 special sounding predictably like themselves doing yet another song. Santa Wants Some Lovin and Classical Christmas come off as lame filler material for an already short collection.Die hard Skynyrd fans will either love it or hate it. What can I say, it ain't Freebird or Mr Breeze...."
4,Whats with you people??,"I think people need to chill out with all the harsh reviews!!! This was just the guys having a good time. Plus, you people aren't real music critics, so take it easy folks!!! And so what if the band carried on with the same name??? We're still getting great music (most recently ""Vicious Cycle"") People don't criticize AC/DC for replacing their vocalist! The Doors have a new vocalist! Kiss, Days Of The New, Judas Priest, Even Metallica have all gone through line up changes, so whats with all the criticism?? Enjoy this for what it is... The band trying to do something fun and special for the fans for the holidays!! If you dont like it, dont listen to it!!! Thats why there's a stop button on your cd player!! I think this was a pretty creative idea and a good listen for any Skynyrd fan"
5,Great Shorts,"Excellent shorts. Very comfortable, has right number of pockets for everything possible and just right for everyday wear or for when it is time to go to the range and put some lead down range. Looks and feels like a quality product."
5,Old bay if old bay weren't made by wusses.,"It's really close to old bay seasoning, but it's got a pretty hefty kick to it regarding spiciness. I haven't cooked our old faves with this seasoning, but I can tell it's going to really take it to that next level. I can taste old bay without needing bread afterwards. This, I needed some chips to get the spice down."
1,What a ripoff,"This book's contents and even it's title are a ripoff of other people's work. Although the idea of a quick guide is right on, if all you do is rent Jim's favorite movies then you might as well just hire him to do all your thinking for you."
4,Sergio's Review!,"LAND OF THE LIVING is a great album. STRONGER is a good album. I think what happens here, is that people expect this album to be a continuum of the first. And that is not the case here! My favorate tracks here are CLUBLAND, NEVER BEEN KISSED, (Ms. W really belts this one!) SOMEONE WATCHING OVER ME, STAND IN LOVE and ALL THAT GLITTERS. IF YOU ONLY KNEW sounds like a radio song and hopefully it will become a known radio song. I really didn't care about THAT'S HOW IT GOES. Otherwise this a very good album. Well worth waiting for! Ms.W should be applauded for this one. Hopefully she will remain a dance singer and not an R&B singer (as evident on some of this album's tracks) -Sergio"
5,I heard it and it blew me away!,"Ok, at first i was a bit skeptical about getting this album. I was never really into this type of music. My girlfriend told me i had to get this album. so i did and i am soooo happy i got it. There is this song called Lovin' you and Stronger that i am addicted to. Everytime i hear it i can't get it out of my head. This cd is stuck in my head and my cd player. She blows me away everytime i listen to a track. I had to get more on her so i went to this website that had some songs available and some cool contests too, like free signed cd's and stuff. go check it out www.click2music.com/kristinew"
3,"Stronger? Well, I don't know about that!","I am a huge Kristine W fan, but I must admit that I was a bit disappointed after listening. While a lot of the songs are fun and bouncy, ""Stronger"" lacks the uniqueness of ""Land of the Living.""I found myself thinking that Kristine's voice was somewhat wasted singing such over produced songs. I'm certainly not going to return my purchase, but ""Stronger"" will not be in strong rotation on my CD player."
2,Not Even Close,"I just purchased Stronger and I am NOT impressed with it. The Land Of The Living is certainly the most powerful club cd by Kristine. Stronger is a lackluster performance. If I wanted Britney Spears (yuck!), then I would purchase her. This is for the birds, and short changes the powerful gift of Kristine's voice."
1,Horrible,"One of the reviews on this page is obviously written by the publisher. The one thing I can't stand about a technical textbook is when graphs or schematics are on one page and the explination is 2 pages later. With this book I find myself spending more time flipping back and forth between the 2 than actually studying. This is just one thing about the book that makes it hard to understand. Oh and one more thing, the ""Circuit Works"" program which you pay for the use of when you buy the text book either doesn't exist or is being kept hidden purposely, none of my classmates or the instructor has been able to access it. I've emailed the publisher twice to no avail."
1,Useless,"Our professor's notes are far better than the book, the book tends to confuse us rather than help. Examples are much too low-end to learn anything related to the assignment questions at the end of the chapter. I think our professor should write his own book. Very confusing."
1,ugly womens watch,"this watch was supposed to be a gift for my wife. when it came, it was ugly, a very large dial for a ladys watch and the strap was too short. I shipped it back to amazon 18 days ago, and am still waiting for the refund to clear. And, oh yes, they charge you the ""free"" shipping when you return the merchandise. Be aware."
4,Great product but...,The watch came in with a dead battery. Dissapointing to have to go to a repair shop to get battery replaced before using.
4,A joy to read and filled with both laughter and sentiment.,"Starting in June 2005 - you will be able to read 4 books in 4 months with a brand new series of romantic novels entitled The Bridesmaid Chronicles. It's a series all about weddings - starting with 3 books, each about a bridesmaid's love story, and leading up to a bride's big wedding day in the fourth book.Karen Kendall has written the first book First Date in The Bridesmaid Chronicles . . . Jersey girl Sydney is determined to put a stop to the upcoming wedding of her little sister and her Texan boyfriend who she's dated only 1 month. There's one problem though . . . Sydney's heart gets distracted by the groom's sexy best friend Alex in the process. First Date is a joy to read and filled with both laughter and sentiment. Collect all 4 novels for yourself or give the entire set as a bridesmaid gift.Additional novels in the collection will include: First Kiss by Kylie Adams, First Dance by Karen Kendall and First Love by Julie Kenner."
3,First Date,"Sure that her sister is making a terrible mistake, Sydney Spinelli is determined to stop her from knowing a man she's known for a month. However, the best man's job has always been to protect the wedding couple from interference, and Alex is indeed the best man for that job. Running interference between Syd and her plans to stop the happy event turns into something that has nothing to do with duty. Whether Alex can convince Syd that her sister and his best friend belong together or not, he wants to convince her that she belongs with him.*** Lightweight fun that you have come to expect from Karen Kendall is in full force here. If you need a breezy read to while away the summer hours, then this will do so very aptly. ***Reviewed by Amanda Killgore, freelance reviewer."
4,The first of the series,This is the story of the Bridesmaid women who falls in love after one month to a Texas wine maker. This story is of 'brides' sister who flys to Texas to stop the engagement. Everything goes wrong and she finds love along the way with a hot business man who daples in Emu's ranching....
1,Utterly Disappointing,This book was awful. It provided false information based on theory without any true research involved. For those wanting to learn about Dragons do NOT buy this book. It makes out dragons to be weak pee-brained animals throwing off the true powerful stature of the draconic kind. As I said for those interested in truly learning about Dragons go find sources elsewhere. I have studied dragons for many years and must say this book has to be one of the worst I read.
5,Whimsically scientific cataloguing of dragons and unicorns!,"Have you ever wanted to have a comprehensive reference guide of two of the best loved mythological creatures ever - the dragon or the unicorn? This book is that reference! The text covers both creatures with a great deal of depth, including such things as classification of ""genus"" and ""species"", habitats, and even migratory patterns. Different passages are accompanied by ""scientific"" diagrams and illustrations, exactly as a standard zoological text would contain. In addition, this tiny gem of a book has information regarding myths and legends from various cultures concerning dragons and unicorns. All of this information is synthesized beautifully, and this book is an absolute delight, for people who like biological science, dragons, or unicorns!"
5,Wonderful memories!,I read this book when I was a very young girl. It opened my imagination incredibly. It's a wonderful book and I'm glad to see it's still in print. I'm buying a copy for my daughter to read!
4,Good Resource,"Although at times drifting into the realm of sappiness, this book is well thought out and well executed. It manages to keep a scientific tone throughout--something you would expect from prolific author, naturalist, and ornithologist, Dr. Paul A. Johnsgard. A book that will provide a world of fun for children, and resources for further exploration for those seriously interested in world myth."
4,ALLIGATOR Meets JAWS,"Okay usually I don't like CGI films but this one took a bite out of me.Tobe Hooper(Director of Poltergeist and the Texas Chainsaw Massacre 1&2) along with F/X artists from the Tom Savini school makes this a fun romp thru the swamp.You will find the usual group of teenagers runnning afoul of one pissed off reptillian parent of a Crocodile.A B-movie that is fun and inventive despite so many other films in this Genre.I ordered this from supermart and it was delivered in no time-a few days later-and the quality of the film and the sound are great.If you like movies like Orca-the killer Whale,Jaws,and Alligator,then this is a must have for any true mother nature gone wild DVD collection.While there is one scene of CGI that will have you thinking that this Crocodile should be in the olympics there are several convincing scenes/mock-ups of this Beast that will impress you.Next up:Crocodile 2 the sequel which i saw on the sy/fy channel and also will be adding to my collection-soon!"
4,pretty good,"Crocodile was a good movie, except the crocodile looked kind of fake. But other then that...pretty cool."
2,Chomp. Crunch. Splat.,"Having seen an edited version of this on TV, I didn't think much of it. It's watchable, but has no original ideas. The characters are pretty stupid, even for the genre. The crocodile looks pretty real, but it's not worth going out of your way for."
3,Goofy as Hell,"I think people who have reviewed this movie miss the genius of it. Its very absurdity is its saving grace. This flick has two moments that make it into my ""creatures run amok"" hall of fame.1)The surviving cast members are trolling through the lake when the crocodile BREACHES over their boat. A 30 foot reptile that can barely move for most of the film displays incredible speed and agility for 5 seconds.2) THe regurgitation. This is almost mythic in concept. Our hero succeds in making the crocodile vomit his recently consumed buddy back to life. I rewound three times.One sad note. Many of us no doubt remember when ""2000"" was added as a subtext to movies or products in an effort to make it seem more futuristic. Now that we've entered the new millenium, that catchy turn of the phrase is lost to the ages....Crocodile 2000."
5,Come on people this is an AWESOM movie!,Most of you out there know the famous Tobe Hooper directed this. Most of his movies are now clasics and this one should be treated the same!Tobe rased the money for this film by him self and put alot of hard work into it. Don't think that you're buying a low budget film with bad actors and a crappy script because you're not. You're buying a low budget film with great acting and an awesom script! It's about a group of 6 teens on spring break being stalked by a 30 foot mother croc because they took her last egg. One by one each teen is devoured until the final three have to find a way to stop the croc before it's too late. If you are a fan of Tobe Hooper you will love it.
4,A killer remake,If you saw the original Texas Chainsaw Masscer and the Poltergist. You'll love this. This movie is a remake of the original Crocodile shout back in 1981. Some tennagers are coming to the lake to party. While exploring the shore and find a nest full of eggs which all but one is destroyed. One of the tennagers takes the egg. Little does he know he is being watch by a full grown 30 foot salt water crocodile. Who got pissed of. Some drunk fisherman disturb here nested. Smash the some of the eggs and threw some in the water where they sunk. The crocodile goes one a killing spree. Will the teens survive find out in the bonechilling conclusion.
4,AN 11 YEAR OLD REVIEWER,"THIS MOVIE WAS COOOOL!!!!! I FIRST BOUGHT IT AT AMAZON.COM, OF COURSE AND WHEN I WATCHED IT, IT BECAME ONE OF MY FAVORITE MOVIES OF ALL TIME.I KNOW MOST PEOPLE HATED THIS MOVIE BUT I THOUGHT IT WAS VERY GOOD. I THOUGHT THIS MOVIE WAS TOBE HOOPER'S BEST YET.TOBE HOOPER HAS DIRECTED PLENTY OF OTHER MOVIES SUCH AS POLTERGEIST, AND TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE.POLTERGEIST WAS AN INSTANT CLASSIC SAME WITH TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE.SYNOPSIS: 8 TEENAGERS SPEND THEIR SPRING BREAK ON BOARD A HOUSEBOAT WHICH THEY GOT A DEAL ON. BUT WHEN THEY FIND A BUNCH OF SMASHED CROC EGGS IN THE MARSHLANDS THEY CAN'T RESIST TAKING ONE NON SMASHED EGG BACK WITH THEM.WHEN THE CROCODILE REALIZES MOST OF HER EGGS ARE SMASHED AND ONE IS GONE SHE GOES ON A WILD RAMPAGE AND STARTS DEVOURING THE TEENS AND A FEW MORE PEOPLE INCLUDING THE SHERIFF.DESPITE THIS MOVIES BAD CGI EFFECTS IT WAS VERY GOOD. IF YOU LIKED THIS MOVIE I WOULD LIKE TO RECOMMEND CROCODILE 2, BLOOD SURF, LAKE PLACID, AND CROCODILE (1981)."
1,The totally blew the budget on a worthless screenplay,Whoever did this had a terrible sense of direction as this film would have been better left as a book. Please don't waste your time on this unless it is the last movie left at the end of the world
1,dumb stupid and mindless,the worst movie ever dome i love reptile movies and bought lots that i didnt like but i did anyway like lake placid/deep blue sea/but this one is just plain stupid bad gore the part where the crocodile eats both the cops andthe part where the crocodile eats the girl who ran out of the bathroom was the worst.the only good part is when the man is eaten on the side of the lake and where the crocodile swallows the guy even tough they cant do that. dome movie tagline get swallowed whole.
2,Good Bad Movie,I would have given this movie at least 3 stars if it wasn't because of some obvious flaws. I'm not complaining about the CGI since its to be expected in this kind of films but flaws like the crocodile turning backwards like if it was some sort of vehicle or jumping like a dolphin makes the film a little hard to watch. Ignoring those flaws this movie was fun to watch but its going to be hard to make a lot of people watch this. Good for when you have nothing to do.
4,"July 15, 2003","This movie was really good and suspenseful. CROCODIlE is about these teenagers that decide to go on a camping trip for spring break. Eventually they find this nest of crocodile eggs {most already smashed} and decide to take the only surviving one back to camp. The crocodile finds that her eggs are missing and goes afte the teenagers when it discovers ther'e responsible. and somehow there boat gets stranded somewhere far from camp and they must flee for their lives as the crocodile goes after them. my favorite parts were when the crocodile bit the rope in half, pushed the car into the swamp, and when it reached up and killed the sheriff and bit the motor in half. the only thing bad about this movie was that so many people die."
2,"ALMOST DECENT,ALMOST","Ah, the world of direct to video movies,My guess is the people who pump this stuff out and give these movies such original titles like this one has must think no one can read the back of the box or is just to stupid to think for more than 2.2 seconds.This movie was effective when the croc attacked in faster than light assaults.but they where not smart enough to hide the thing for very long.the characters are so stupid you will be glad when the die.The movie was made by tobe hooper.go watch texas chainsaw instead."
1,*yawnnnnnnn*,OMG!! another CROC Movie!! and from a talented director to boot!whats amatter with these people! I said it before I'll say it againPUHHlease come up with original ideas!
3,"Not terrible, but...","Since the movie's UK premier I watched it over and over again, repeatedly for days on end.Why am I giving it three stars then? Because I recently realized almost every time I watched it, I started watching from when people began getting chomped in quick succession, which was quite a while into the movie.Yes, it's kind of slow-paced throughout the majority of the movie."
5,One of the Sickest Games for PS2.,"Finally, the third sequel of Ratchet & Clank is here! I've been waiting months for it to come out. Ratchet & Clank: Up Your Arsenal (and Jak 3) are the best games that I have. This game is so ill since Insomniac Games has created a whole new line of weapons and gadgets and since you can upgrade your weapons up to four times now. Insomniac Games and Naughty Dog (Jak 3) make the best adventure games ever. Some people say that Ratchet & Clank is better thanJak 3 - or vice versa - but to me they are perfectly equal. Well, I'm going to wright a review for Jak 3 now. Please come and see it."
5,Ratchet and Clank Rule,"This game had to be the best one of the 3 part series. Although the events after Going Commando (the 2nd game in the series) aren't cleared up at first, it seems that your enemy is. Dr. Nefarious and his scheme to eliminate organic life. But the one thing that always shined with Ratchet and Clank were the weapons. They are breath-taking. Each has 4 upgrade levels. It is challenging yet so desirable. I couldn't put it down to i got each weapons finalized form. and I mean ALL the weapons. But PARENTS don't be SCARED of all this WEAPON talk. The guns don't go multilate and show gore and blood. There is about no violence that many kids haven't already seen on t.v. movies, etc. So please pick this one up. It is well worth it. Plus the ending is spectatcular...perhaps a sequel...like Ratchet: Deadlocked?"
5,RATCHET BREAKS THE ICE.,"MY NAME IS ALEXANDER. Ratchet & Clank 3 still is the best platform game. I love the weapons and you can upgrade your weapons 4 times. that's not including challenge mode, but in challenge mode you can upgrade your weapons an extra 3 times. i GOT THE GAME WHEN IT CAME OUT. I like the vehicles even though going commando has more. It's rumoured in R&C2 & 3 you must complete the games without taking a hit or dyeing. The multi-player is fun but do what I did and play it online. EVERY BIT OF THIS GAME IS FUN!!! THE ARENA BATTLES ARE FUN! I LOVE THE RANGER MISSONS AND BOSS BATTLES!!!!!IF THEY MAKE A RATCHET & CLANK 4 IT WOULD TURN THIRD PERSON PS2 GAMES INTO GLASS!!!!!!!!!! GET THIS GAME YOU WON'T REGRET IT UNLESS IF YOU DON'T BUY IT!!!!! THANK YOU ISONMIAC BUT I REALLY WANT TO THANK TED PRICE FOR MAKING RATCHET AND CLANK THE BEST PLAFORM GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Powerful Conclusion to RAC Trilogy,"Ratchet and Clank have always had a good series, but this isa unbelievable! If you love Jak and Daxter(I think it sucks) than I think that you would have a lot more fun with this. More weapons, more strategy, more enemies, and a lot of stuff to blow up!! And it includes a multiplayer obtion and online gaming, something that Jak 3 doesn't."
5,Ratchet UYA is a great game!,"I haven't been playing these games for long, but after playing the first and second, I wanted to see the third. Many have given it almost a 10 out of 10 in ratings and there actually right. It doesn't have much of a different feel than the second game but it sure didn't let me down. Your nanotech still upgrades along with your weapons with the more things you kill, there is similar music, control, and challenges from Going Commando. The fun gladiator arenas are back, with even tougher challenges. Classic characters from the series return like Al, Slim Cognito, Captian Qwark, and Skid McMarx. I give this game 5 stars because quite possibly, this game brings out the best in the PS2."
5,Already know its going to be GREAT,"Own 1 & 2 and absolutly LOVED them. If its from insominac, u know its going to be great. Loved thier Spyro (1 & 3) as well. Can't wait, November seems too long away :-( But it will be worth it."
4,MY son loves this game,My son plays this game a lot. He must like it very much. This is a relatively healthy game -- no violent. Good for a young teenager.
5,A cool game with tons of weapons,"I already had the 1st and 2nd game of the ratchet and clank series, and I just had to get this game. When I got it I was shocked at how much better it is than the others. Once I beat the game twice I thought there was nothing else to do... but then I remembered it was an online game, then I bought the network adapter and I played it for at least two months. If you are looking for a good game GET THIS!!!! Go, buy it now!!!"
4,Great addition to PS2 collection,"The ratchet and clank series have always been fun and action packed. This one is no exception. 3-D action shooters, platformers this game will keep you playing for hours."
5,r&c:uya review,"rcuya is a great game. good amount of single player game and online mode is really fun. the new control setup thats 3rd person w/ fps controls works perfectly. weapons upgrade a ton but there could have been a few more gadgets. still an amazing game, one of the most fun games ive played."
5,Beat R&C Game Yet!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This is the best game yet of this series. Much easier to obtain large quantities of bolts to buy new weapons/armor. Great story line... weapon upgrades are obtained faster than the last game. Great game!!!
4,Ratchet and Clank:Up Your Arsenal,Ratchet & Clank Up Your ArsenalTerrific game with multiple reasons to play more than once and increased difficulty from the original Ratchet and Clank.The story is not too bad either.
5,BEST GAME EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"THIS GAME IS AWSOME!! When you finish the game you get to try it in challenge mode, same game just harder ans the RYNO is better then ever. If you have a PS2 and you have enough money get this game at all costs!!!"
5,FUN,"I was new to Ratchet and Clank so this was my first experience with this series of games, but after having played for a couple of hours, I have to say the following: it's fun. I wasn't expecting much despite the rave reviews, because as far as ps2 games go, they tend to fail in 3ps but this one did not and because of this game, I think I should all the other ratchet and clank games."
2,More Like Stupid And Blank,"I love the Ratchet and Clank series. I was waiting for the 3rd game to come out. It did. This game stinks! The weapons are totally stupid, the upgrades are dumb for them, the levels even stink! The only good part is that you sit back and get to listen to the good story parts more often. [...]"
1,boo,this game is rubish all they did was copy daxter of jak and daxter/jak so i woudnt ever play a game that has ben copyed by a difrent game so if you like this game then you would prefer jak and daxter/jak the real creaters of daxter/ratchet so you shoudnt buy this you should buy jak and daxter/jak
1,this game sucks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This game is soooooo boring!You go around hitting people with a tool.It is no fun whatsoever.there is no storyline.It is about as much fun as drinking liquid poop.
5,Amazing! The best game i've ever played,"This game is awesome. There is no blood or gore or anything, and any crude humor goes right past the kids ears and into the adult ones for a laugh. Here are my ratings:Graphics: 9/10 Although they are believable, they are sort of blotchy sometimes, and there are some glitches in them.Control: 9/10 The game responds slowly if you have been playing for over an hour, but if you save and restart, it is fine.Originality: 10/10 Although this game follows the same basic storyline as the other two, the missions and levels are much different.Length: 10/10 The game goes on for as long as it takes you to beat it. You can then play again in challenge mode (slightly harder)Overall: 10/10 This game is ideal for anyone who enjoys playing action or adventure-type games."
3,game quit playing half way through - defective disk,I really enjoyed the game until quit playing and had to go out and buy another disk! As far as the game goes I really like it and enjoy this style of game play!
1,Wrong play!,What I got was the cover of Happy Days and a completely different play on the inside. Sent a note about it and haven't heard anything back. Annoyed.
1,Not my cup of metaphorical tea...,"So we are supposed to ""read in"" to the deeper meaning of an elderly woman and her irrational attempts to delude herself about her terminal situation. Ok, I get that part. When the redundance of her babbling stream of consciousness became unbearable, I realized this was just an attempt to get back at his wife for badgering him to do a ""happy"" play, and we are all just victims of his ironic joke.What is fascinating to me, is the rationalizing that must take place among Mr. Beckett's admirers. Admiring him for his great works, they must reach deep for some rationalization of their own as to why this is also a great work. This play gives you such a shallow plot, with no real sympathetic character, you can write your own backstory and intent. Yes, it has a few cute moments, but by-and-large if you don't like a stop sign, just pretend it's an ice cream cone - happy me. Brilliant? Ugghh!!!"
1,"Happy Days is a tragic, tragic misfire","I am loathe to badmouth anything that came from the great Samuel Beckett, but I can't bear it. Happy Days is the worst play I have ever read. It is a mundane, insipid melodrama of no merit whatsoever. The idea is weak to start with; Winnie is a middle-aged woman buried up to her waist in dirt. SWith only a few possessions and Willie, a mumbling gargoyle of sorts, to keep her company, she remains entrapped in her absurdist situation, delivering a dull monologue that swings between pathetic whining and annoying screeching. I can't even imagine that watching this play would be an any more pleasant experience. No one moves at all, and all that keeps this play ""going"" is Winnie's humdrum soliloquoy. It's hard to imagine that the talent behind Waiting for Godot and Krapp's Last Tape could have been responsible for this tripe. I'm a worse person for having read Happy Days, a book which only deserves the title when it is burned publicly."
2,"Classic, Schmlassic.","Even though I consider myself fairly versed in theatre, I have to say that ""Happy Days"" fails to resonate. Granted Beckett is out there, but he accomplished far greater things with the sublimely ridiculous ""Waiting For Godot.""""Happy Days"" seems to wander around like a freshman who doesn't know what class he/she wants. Looking for absurdist theatre? You're much better off with Ionesco's ""Bald Soprano."""
1,deep with no eternainment value,I am a college student who was required to read the book. I am all about deep meanings in life and looking for other ways of interpeting a writers different views but i feel this book/play was a waste of thought and lacked any purpose
3,Youth Bat Backpack,"I bought this for my younger son (5 1/2) for tee ball. I thought he'd like to have his own bag since his older (10 1/2 year old) brother has his own bag. I love the fact that it's small and compact in size for my little guy to carry on his own, but it's not as easy to ""use"" at a traditional bat bag. The area where the bat fits is a little difficult to use. The bat fits very snugly and then is attached with velcro. My son has little patience for the velcro so Mom & Dad usually end of doing this ourselves :(. The other disadvantage to this type of bag is the fact that the bat handle sticks out. We really have to watch our son around cars!!! Overall it serves its purpose and wasn't a bad deal at $[...]."
4,A CONSTANT PURCHASE,I have used countless tubes of this. It works pretty good. My only complaint being that it's adhesion qualities aren't as good at high temps.
4,7 year old,"Very Heavy and sturdy feeling. We aren't guitar players but plan on giving my son guitar lessons. It sounds good to me with a little honeywell $20 amp I bought for him.Be careful when tuning I broke one of his strings the first day. Ours does say ""playmate"" on the head of guitar, not DEAN."
3,It's not a bass guitar,"The product name (Dean Bass Guitar...) suggests this is a bass guitar, but it's actually a jr-size, 6-string electric guitar. Looks nice and is a great size for my 8-year-old. Some parts are plastic and don't look very sturdy - but looks to be a good value for the price. We're still looking for a 3/4 electric bass, in case anyone has a recommendation."
3,Good product,A lot smaller than I imagined but it sounds great. I had to get this guitar after the First Act guitar I got my 8 yr old son for xmas didn't work. This seems to work well and work the money. Good size for 10 yrs and younger.
3,Whore Two,"I thought the first movie ""Whore"" '(Whore:If You Can't Say It Just See It)' was much better and funny. I thought Whore 2 was going to a be sequel to the first one with the same actress Theresa Russell but actress was entirely different and way different movie from the first. I liked the part about the writer researching for his book and the ending was gripping most of the rest of it was kind of slow moving. I would say it's an OK movie but not as good as the first one.By the way, the VHS movie came fast and was in great shape, the seller gets Four Stars from me, thank you!"
5,nutsettet set,"Quick ship, nutsetters were made with hardened metal and are exactly what I needed. The shafts are short for those hard to get to places. Very satisfied...Thanks"
2,Huh?,"I was very suprised by this book. After reading some of the other reviews it seemed the author may have hit on a new idea or something midly profound. Unfortunately, no.This book is 13 chapters of Hashing functions and encryption functions. By hashing/or encrypting specific columns you can protect the data... Ok. No new concepts here. I could have read that in 3 paragraphs and saved myself an afternoon of reading and a few dollars.This book is *not* essential for DBA, developers or anyone else with a basic understanding of hashing or encryption functions.Perhaps this would be more appropriate in a college environment or for a beginer."
3,"Good, but maybe not for experienced people","If you work in security and databases; skip this book.It touches on column-level encryption, mixing plaintext data and hashing to secure data (i.e. hash a password then store it and compare against the hash when people log in) without sacrificing the usefulness of data.I don't want to say the book is bad, it just doesn't have any real new concepts for experienced professionals. If you're new to securing data (that resides in databases or not) then this book might be a good resource.This sort of information isn't really covered in another book that I know of, and believe me, I have a lot of tech books (roughly 5 bookshelves worth)."
3,Best Timemachines ever written ??????????????,"I would not say that these are the ""best"" timemachine stories ever written. However there are some popular authors included, and Star, Bright is included. Ray Bradbury has a very overrated story in here. Since I am writing a timemachine story myself, I decided to check this book out. It is not a total waste of money, but this book is overrated. Sorry for using the same adjective twice. Serling has a story in here, but everyone has seen the story before on Twlight Zone before. The publisher even puts one his own stories in it, (filler?).Anyway, the book is not easy to find, and not all the stories are that easy to find either. In that aspect it is worth purchasing if you really want to have a copy of Star, Bright.DH"
1,Barron`s Finance book rating,It is an interesting book for a beginner..It just needs to provide enough elaboration of the material and enough examples for that matter though!Thank you
3,so-so,This book is ok. It didn't have that many hair styles. It would have been better if it had more picures. Its hard to do somthing without seeing what its supposed to look like. I'd recomend getting it from the library because it isn't that great.
3,A bit disappointing,"I have thoroughly enjoyed all of Carey's books -- but not the Godslayer books. Carey is a marvelous writer, very thorough in her attention to details and does the finest job of wrapping up all the loose ends. I was expecting the same with the Godslayer books, however these two books are different. The story moved back and forth between characters, ponderously slow while giving little hope for a fine resolution. The end was disappointing, and the small bit of hope that might lead to a third Godslayer book was not enough to compel me to read another on this tale."
2,disappointing conclusion,"Carey's prose in the conclusion of The Sundering is as poetic and skillful as ever, however she does not seem to care at all for her characters. I got the feeling she lost interest in the story and slapped out a conclusion so she could move on to something else. Any interest the reader had in the characters after reading Banewreaker is lost as they stumble toward what she describes as an inevitable conclusion. The only interesting characters all die when the entire theme of the first book pointed toward the fact that they reach some kind of peace. Plot lines that seemed original and intriguing, such as the attraction between Tanaros and Cerelinde, peter out. The promise of the first book has been squandered. I had to finish it to see what happened, but was sorely disappointed."
2,Skillfully written and ultimately pointless,"SPOILER WARNING. I was very disappointed by this book. Not because of how it does or doesn't relate to Tolkien (I don't care), but on its own merits. It's skillfully written, but the emotion foremost in my heart at the end was: so what? There is almost no evolution of the main characters, which is a capital sin of storytelling, and what evolution does happen matters little, as Carey kills almost everyone off at the end. I love (and most highly recommend) Carey's other works, but I found this book (and its predecessor) a well-wrought, colossal waste of time."
1,"love the author, not this series tho.","It was most difficult to get into. Complicated, more to the liking of D&D players. They like that sorta boring stuff... I never managed to read the series-but my friend whos a D&D freak likes it. go figure! Her Kushiel Series was Awesome! couldn't put them down!"
1,NOT RECOMMENDED,"If you read the Kushiel series, and think this may be more of the same quality, you will be disappointed. I bought and read both books in this duet (at least I'm hoping it's just a duet!), and had to fight to keep my interest on the pages. That is not what I expected after Carey's first 3 offerings. Bottom line, don't waste your money or your time. You'll find it hard to care about anyone in this story, and those chararcters who do manage to engage your vague interest, all die. I reached the final page and shook my head in disgust. Go out today and buy all 3 books of her Kushiel series. Avoid this series like the plague!"
3,A bit disappointing,"I know this is a re-write from the perspective of the King of the Nazguls from Lord of the Rings, so we know how the story ends. That's not why I knocked off two stars. I did that because the characters just aren't that interesting. The only two who held my interest was the half-breed who seemed to hate everything and Lord Sartoris himself. He was interesting. The others just felt like place-holders. I will say that this world is dissimilar enough from Middle-Earth and the remaining characters and possibilities are intriguing enough that if the author returns to this world with an original series, I'd probably read it."
4,Came right away,"These came right away and were super cheap, but not what I thought. I ordered the wrong thing. But for what they are, they are well made."
5,VH1 for Rick - great cd & video,"Rick is such a great entertainer, with so many favorite songs, that you'll just listen to this over and over. You'll know lots of the songs even if you're not a longtime Rick-ster-fan. Great compilation -just wish it continued into later years and more of his biographical songs - I know - if we all buy this, maybe there will be a sequel! A MUST FOR EVERY RICK FAN."
5,Hilarious,"Absolutely hilarious classics starring Bob Hope and Bing Crosby as Bob Hope and Bing Crosby. This is for those of us who truly love great one-liners. There are many other gags as well, but the juice is in the rapport."
3,A generally good B comedy,"Road Show is far from Hal Roach's best, but nowhere near his worst either. Oddly, Adolph Menjou is the mediocrity in this film, the rest of the cast holds up pretty well.The highlight of this film is 'The Charioteers,' a nearly forgotten African American ensemble from the 30's and 40's singing several songs including ""Calliope Jane."" The DVD audio transfer of the song from the film is better than any I've heard off old Columbia '78's.Shemp Howard makes a cameo."
4,Fun films but packaging misses bullseye,"The first four ROAD pictures are real treasures of comedy and music. Hope and Crosby's easy style have often been immitated by newer comics and even animated characters, but never equalled. The only downside to this collection is putting all on one disc. Just don't like double sided discs when not necessary. Making this a two disc set should not have increased production costs enough to increase the purchase price. Finally, WHY only the first four? Was it a rights issue? The 5th, RIO, must surely still be under Universal/Paramounts control. Still these squabbles don't negate the life of these films. What classic Hollywood was all about..."
1,ON THE ROAD WITH BOB HOPE AND BING CROSBY,THIS SET WAS A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT. I GAVE IT TO MY HUSBAND FOR CHRISTMAS. ON ONE SIDE THE SIGAPORE DOESN'T PLAY AT ALL. THERE ARE PARTS THAT ARE NOT AS CLEAR AS THEY COULD BE. I GUESS I MISSED THE PART WHERE IT SAID THAT IT WAS BLACK AND WHITE. NOT A GOOD PURCHASE AT ALL.
4,great box set,I loved this box set. I used to see these on Sunday afternoons nice to be able to see them whenever I like. Great quality.
5,A Great Set,"If you don't like classic comedy, you're not going to like this either. But for me, this is my first stop when I need to take a break from the Marx Brothers (who I watch way too much). These films are exhibit A for Bob Hope's comedic talents, and Bing's cooler than you or I will ever be. Plus with Bing around, I'm actually happy to listen when the songs come, which is not the case for most 30's and 40's Hollywood films. Morocco is my favorite, but any of these four films can brighten a dark day. There are a few decent extras on this set, and for $20 it's a steal. If you're willing to watch a comedy made before ""Animal House,"" you should go ahead and take the plunge into Hope and Crosby's world."
4,Fun film.,"Hope and Crosby are excellent in the first of the ""Road"" pictures. The plot is a bit thin, but the dialogue, slapstick fight scenes, and music are very good."
5,Fantastic,"Nostalgia overload. I remember watching these movies when I was a child with my mother, who has since passed away. I think of her whenever I watch them. I cannot believe how the humour has stayed so funny after all these years. I think children of today would find them just as much fun as I did."
4,HAL ROACH EDITION!!!!!,"The Hal Roach edition from Image is the only option I would advise getting. There were no real issues with this release. The print shows it age with white specks and lines, but no splices. The volume is a bit low."
4,"Zany, Zingy, Bob and Bingy!","My husband asked for a Bob Hope movie for his 57th birthday, so my daughter bought him this collection. I think through the golden lens of time he was remembering unparalelled hilarity. I was expecting him to be in stitches, but barely a chuckle came forth! If anything, we were in awe of the youthfulness of Bob Hope! I think it was a stark reminder of how old we are now, and that had a sobering effect on my husband. I laughed aloud however, and marvelled at how sleek, slim and glamorous the stars were back then. The plots are simple and contrived, with a lot of slapstick and this collection is a fascinating look backwards. It is a refreshing genre and I'll take this any day over most of what passes as comedy these days. I laughed quite a bit. My 14 year old daughter was bewildered. She loves Barney Fife, Dick Van Dyke, and Bewitched, but this is going a bit far back for her taste."
3,Great feel... looks ehh...,"Bought these for my lounge around shoes. Great feel, light weight and keep my feet cool. As for staying clean... that's another story. I'm not working in the coalmines, just chasing after my 5 yr. old daughter. Sandboxes, puppies and the playground are killers to these shoes. Cleaning is also tough w/ the plastic sides. ""Clear"" plastic cleans but the material beneath stays dirty."
4,Very comfortable,I have always been an adidas man...And as usual this time too I was not disappointed.Fits excellently. Not too sure what to do with those spare insoles though.
5,The best cushion experience on training shoes,These shoes provide the best cushion experience on cross-training or running. I am so delighted with them!.
2,They drop the ball on this film. It could be so much more.,"Some B films are great and they have a cult following, but this B film will never have a cult following in latter years to come, because this film lacks a good plot. Every film need a good plot story or it will become a mess.This film has got a weak plot story, but it not mess and it not scary-suspense action movie. It just scary looking bats killing people action movie.If you people who saw this film and think this film is a scary-suspense action movie, you all are out of your minds.If you people want to see a good scary-suspense action movie with a good story plot, see JAWS.This film is not bad and it not good. You people should see this film only once on cable and never see it again."
2,TRASH ALL ALONG !! THIS IS FUNNY !!,"COme n, guys,, this movie can't be taken seriously. It's a joke, a B-movie, a trash horror movie. The old cliche of the local sheriff fighting the ""monsters"" made me laugh ( I never expected Lou Diamond in a role like this ). The reason I'm giving it two stars is that, even taking the reasons above as explanation, the movie is very bad."
2,A stupid and very chessy (and gory) horror movie.,"This is a very prdictable horror about crazed bats attacking a small Texas town. A zoologist must stop them before the whole town dies.The special effects are terrible. We see an up-close of someone's guts after the bats have eaten him, and they look like spaghetti. All the other special effects are bad too. It also rips off other movies like The Birds.All in all, don't see this movie unless it's on tv and you've got nothing else to do."
4,This is a great movie,"I don`t really know why people critize so much this movie... I think all these people don`t care about enjoying it, they just want ""especial effects"", thecnologic scenes. The movie is really good, most of horror films like ""Bats"" are also fun, of course, but it doesn`t mean it`s not good. If you try to put yourself on actor`s shoes and comprehend the story you will like it... The only thing we can`t do is to begin watching the film guessing we won`t gonna like it because it`s impossible to like any movie this way..."
3,Batty good fun!,"""Bats"" is a predictable and campy horror flick with a so-so cast that spouts off mind-numbing dialogue. However, it's fun, exciting, and (at times) scary. Not a good movie, but a good escape from the pressures of life."
2,Ten Years Too Late,"Sadly enough, this movie managed in proving only one thing to me, that good, old fashioned horror is dead.Bats are plaguing Texas, a self-xplanatory title.The computer-generated bats, who glide swiftly and attack with cunning, cannot save this film from complete disaster. Neither can the star, Lou Diamond Phillips.Phillips not only seems out of place as the Sheriff of Gallup Texas, but completely off key the entire film, in his own little world, and relating little to his supporting cast.At his side, Dina Meyer conveys a somewhat reasonable role of the bat specialist enlisted to help deal with the situation. Unfortunately, she does little the entire film and I really don't understand her role when there were apparently already two bat specialists on the case.I miss the old horror days, that took more to wit than making its monsters believable, and they surely have vanished. In their place we have ""Bats"", and that doesn't say much for its future, if any exists."
4,i don't know why...,i don't know why everyone blazes this film up and down...now it wasn't exactly a masterpiece but it was at least decent enough to get made. those bats were some bad MoFo's and therefore were able to rip things apart with ease. Lou Diamond Phillips was did a pretty decent job here as did Leon...this movie was pretty raw since the bats were the main ones that made this flick with support from Lou Diamond Phillips and Leon
1,"There should be a ""0"" star rating!","Unless someone pays you to watch this movie, don't. There is not one redeeming line, sceene or shot that makes it worth an hour out of your life. Take a nap instead. Burn ants with a maginifiing lens or something....just don't waste your time.."
