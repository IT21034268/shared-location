1,Either a fake or out of date product,"Having never used this product before I was not familiar with it. I noticed immediately that the scent did not last very long and up on investigating further I have come to the conclusion that this is a fake or beyond expiration date product. After examining the bottle I discovered that a small portion of the label on the bottle had been cut out and removed. This was discovered after reading others reviews of this product. I am extremely disappointed in this product since it was sold by Amazon. If I had discovered this earlier I would have sent it back to Amazon. One star is the least I could give, otherwise I would rate it even lower."
5,Really sexy smell,"My boyfriend smells so good with this. Very fresh smell, just like right out of the shower. Highly recommended if you want him to turn you on!!"
4,perfect little birthday gift,This perfume was one of the gifts I gave my husband for his birthday and he liked it a lot!I think its really good for the price!
1,Doesn't last,It smells fresh and good. Not something that would grab anybody's attention. But the real minus is that it doesn't last for more than a couple of hours. After that there is no trace of it.
3,Mediocre,"Ive read the reviews of other people and solely relied on them, I dont know what kind of taste do these people have, but I wouldnt rate this anything above mediocre."
4,Very original,"I picked this book up because of its great cover (I have a different edition) and the story on the back sounded good.And it is.""Hunted"" lives off it's highly original storyline. N.M. Browne creates a dark and mysterious setting for the unusual sight of Karen, a girls soul trapped in a fox as she lies in a coma, dying.Some passages following the parallel hospital-story are deeply sad, especially when her ex boyfriends visits her a last time or her grandma watches her faraway sleep. And many scenes in the actual adventure are filled with excitement but also despair, for Karens strength is growing weaker - in reality and her adventure.This book is very emotional and to be recommended for readers about 14 years old."
1,Worst Book Ever,"This is the worst book I ever watsed my money on. I read the back of the book, the story seemed original and fresh. I read the first chapter, compelling and action filled and made you wonder what happened next. But then right after the second chapter it just spirals down hill like a plane caught in a death spiral until it crashes and burns. Karen turns into a fox, waking up in this new world that seems to be the medeival era to us. But she seems more like a robot, she does things as a fox, never thinks and hangs around a strange man. I found the plot incredibly slow, borring and lame. In the end she dies, leaping infront of a sword to save the man she loves( a man and a fox?. It could have been a LOT more original and fresh then just junk stringed togather. The writing style is slow, the action is as instense as watching snails,and the charcters are weak and plastic. Do not waste good money9or effort) on purchasing this book."
3,"Ehh, no big deal",Pretty low quality and way overpriced. But - it does the job. For this item that's what counts. I'm not impressed but I'll keep it.
3,"Bardot, a dynamic fun-loving woman and Boyer, an old-style romantic without the grand manner...","Vadim changed Brigitte's image and way of life from that of the young society beauty he had married to that of a rebellious and challenging teenager of the 1950s...""Une Parisienne"" succeeded in launching her ravishing figure as the teenage goddess, the casual sexuality, the provocative gaiety in confrontation with men...Charles Boyer -- as Prince Charles -- was the perfect, ideal choice of those magically romantic moments... His deep and vibrant voice spoke a promise of new adventures in love... His deep, wondering eyes bespoke a worldly knowledge untarnished by cynicism... He had the boudoir grace of Valentino without the hysteria or the sometime effeminacy of the great lover... Under Michel Boisrond's direction, Boyer was an old-style romantic without the grand manner..."
3,fun - but dubbed,"This movie is fun. How could one hate Sophia Loren and Marcello Mastroianni? She' young and lovely; he's young and handsome. My complaint is that the film is dubbed into English. Though well-done, I soon discovered it when Charles Boyer started to speak, and his splendid voice was not to be heard. If this does not bother you it probably won't amount to a negative. The scenery is good."
5,fabulous writing pens,"I buy these for my own use... but am careful to hide them at work. They seem to disappear off my desk. Enough said? These pens are awesome. Smooth writing, stay capped in my purse, and they last longer than you'll be able to keep or find them."
1,Paid $79 for 4 Uni-ball jetstream stick bold point pens,"Instead of sending 4 boxes of 12 pens each, they sent me a total of 4 pens!Will have to return these. Ridiculous. There's no phone #, no email to contact ..."
5,Great pen!,It writes clearly and smoothly and at the right price. Also it's pretty stylish and looks high end. What else would you want?
3,not very satisfied,"the leather is very hard, not too comfortable. and in general not great quality, just decent"
1,horrible,I got a copy of this cd from their show at the velvet lounge and it was incredibly disappointing. The lead singer tries unsuccessfuly to channel Kurt Cobain while in reality needs some singing lessons.
1,This book is terrible..,"This book is probably the most poorly written book ever, not only is it cumbersome to read, its got more typos than a 2nd graders homework. For example on page 111 the author shows some code samples with the named element %string_name....but refers to that named element as %variable_name... in the the text. Utterly confusing to a casual reader. Honestly 1 star is too much for this book. Was the editor asleep? or was there even an editor?A lesson to you aspiring writers, Proof Read your work, because every one sees the typos."
3,Nothing Groundbreaking,"There are two b-sides here to speak of. 'Banana Co.' can also be found on ""Itch,"" the extremely pricey Japanese import e.p. It's a good song, but not one of Radiohead's most memorable ones. 'Molasses' may be available other places, but not that I am aware of. It also is a good song, but is it worth the price of this single for these two b-sides? That really depends on how much you like Radiohead. 'Street Spirit' is a great song, but you can get it on ""The Bends"" as well as the other U.K. single for this song which is a lot more interesting. My advice is to buy ""The Bends"" AND the other single if you're a big fan."
2,Sadly Superficial,"How anyone who has read other VCA books and can like this book I will not understand. It really has no depth, no intriguing plot, nothing. The only reason I finished the series was to find out who Melody's father was. I liked the Ghostwriter until this series, sadly a rushed pathetic excuse of a novel. Melody was a nice girl, but was paper-thin really."
4,Comprehensive island guide.,"Patrick Bailey, Orkney (David and Charles, 1985)Patrick Bailey's survey of Orkney, which came up on my screen during a search on travel books, is only travel writing in some sick, sadistic parallel universe where one cannot travel to a foreign country without knowing everything, and I mean everything, there is to know about it.Wait a minute. That sounds rather like utopia.If you pick up this book, you will learn about Orkney. You can forget tourist destinations, with the exception of a chapter in the back (which sounds much like most other travel writing). The bulk of the book is taken up with history, geology, the study of place names, population movements, that sort of thing. It's quite an excellent overview, given its brevity (just shy of two hundred fifty pages). Not really for the traveller, but the armchair archaeologist and the person who really wants to get down to the nitty-gritty of the Orkney Islands will really get a kick out of it. ***"
5,A BOOK EVERY WOMAN SHOULD READ!,"I can't thank Rosalind Miles enough for this fantastic book about women's true place in history. Just as I never learned about the important black people who shaped our world, I also never learned about important women. The shocking thing to me is that neither I nor anyone of my generation ever really noticed this omission!Rosalind Miles' unimpeachable research and documentation give this book a wonderfully informative tone, but it isn't dry or pedantic like most histories, and her tongue in cheek sense of humor keeps it from being depressing (which it easily could be, because the information certainly is). This is a book that every woman should cherish and give to her friends, sisters and daughters."
3,For Intellectuals,"Its not a book you can read from cover to cover, but one that you delve into now and again. Its a shame that such an important concept/perspective is written for the few highbrows that can understand it. The writer should have made a political choice as to a much wider audience appreciation."
4,Women in history,"This is a remarkable and exhaustive review of women in history---not easy to do since history is largely written by men. Some of the earliest accounts may be dubious since they are stories and myths, not written accounts. But the rest of the work looks very solid. Also, her writing is engaging, with bits of humor."
5,Prerequisite,"I just want to say that if you want to read this book, you will benefit by reading Patience & Sarah first (or at least the first half), also by Miller. There are many very deep parellels to these two books, and I imagine it would be rather difficult to fully enjoy this novel without the other."
5,VERY PLEASED,This watch is perfect for me.I like the twist and flex type band and only have had to reset the time for daylight savings. Easy to read and has even been in the swimming pool a couple times by accident with no problems.
1,Nice but Very poor quality,"The watch sweats when exposed to moisture. It is definitely not waterproof or even water resistent to 50ft. Take a walk in the fog and you can bring the experience back home inside the watch. I guess this can be romantic for some people. Mine actually rusted inside. I even opened it whenever it fogged up, dried it out for a couple days, cleaned the sealing surfaces etc....The other thing is the band is really poor quality. It dents very easily. Bump your arm and it will be dented. And I'm not talking about pounding nails in with the band. Just brush up against a door and its dented.I was real disappointed. The watch isn't even a 6 months old. Of course I can't find the 1""x1"" warrantee card I stapled my reciept onto. I'd buy another model or brand.It's too bad because I really liked the watch."
4,Timex watch,"The inexpensive Timex watch, with date, and illumination is as it was advertised. The only thing I don't like is the stretch metal band that goes around my wrist. It takes, for me some getting used to."
2,had to send it back,"I love the watch, its easy to read and think the indiglo is great. While clearing some early october snow from our trees the watch got moisture in it. Its supposed to be water resistant to 50 meters."
4,Not too bad of a watch,This watch is functional and well made. I purchased it as a present for my grandfather and it met all of his needs.
5,I can see again,I love my watch because I can see the hands easly and read the date without squinting.
3,Hmmmm....,"Watch is just like it looks on the screen. However, I don't know where the measurement thing came from. It actually measures 37mm from the winding dial edge to the opposite edge. Smaller than I wanted. I bought this as a gift for my daughter so the band is too big. I knew this upon purchase. The flex band was not very difficult to adjust. However, I did have a jewelry needle nose plyer in the house. I didn't like that as careful as I tried, it still left an indentation on the edges. The '3-position crown' is not easy to adjust. I was scared it might damage it if I pulled too hard. I've had timexs before and yeah it takes a licking but keeps on ticking. It's much easier if the right instructions are in the package. Only takes half an hour to adjust the time. Where is the middle position???"
2,well...okay i guess,issues that make it unusable to me..1- band is just to tight and I am not fat.2- to change the day of the week you must spin the dial for way to long to get the day/date right...took way too long.sigh...I just put the very tight band on the bike as a second watch when riding...waste of money...sorry for the bad review..get what you pay for I guess.
3,Timex Mens watch,"We tried to shorten the band and found it was too complicated. However Timex did offer to do the job, but it was too costly to pay the shipping, etc.The watch itself is a nice product and is highly recommended--we have two in our household and find the 10 year battery life to be outstanding, unlike the others that last but a year with cheap Chinese innards.Reason for the three stars: the band, unable to shorten, and Timex NEVER sent the 30% rebate!!!!"
3,"for the price, I would expect more - especially from Timex","If the watch did not have a date ""feature"", I probably would have been happier. The date ""feature"" is 100% worthless. It is fine if we had 31 days in each month but of course we do not. So it means constantly changing it, which is a lesson in patience. And I tried hard to get the day (comes set to ""WED"") to change but it would not. So I ended up with WED 6, when it is really THU 6. This is a gift for my brother so I will tell him to ignore the calendar and just enjoy having a good display for the time. The main reason I bought this particular watch was because of the clear display and the stretch band, which my brother needs. Due to these good aspects, I am giving it 3 stars but I would give it 2.5 if I could because of the irritating date ""feature""."
2,Date set,Was unable to set date ( had jewelr look at it and stem mech not functional) and would have to set it each month to compensate for non 31 day months
3,Timex Expandband Watch,This is a very basic but very good men's watch. It does not have any bells or whistles but for the price I was willing to pay I think it would be hard to find a better product.
5,men's timex t20461 easy reader,"AM IMPRESS WITH THIS WATCH. THE REASON I PURCHASED: I WANTED A WATCH THAT WAS EASY TO READ AND HAD A BACK LIGHT.I AM RETIRED, I TEND TO FORGET THE DAY AND DATE OF ANY WEEK. THIS WATCH FILL THESE NEEDS TO THE LETTER."
4,Nice cheap watch,"I sent the first one back; the day wouldn't roll past Sunday. It worked the rest of the week, but come Monday, it still said ""Sunday"". But the second one works fine. Nice-looking watch. The band is a little bit cheap. It's not made as well as a real Twist-O-Flex, but for the price I don't mind upgrading to a nice band."
4,Easy to Read,This watch was exactly what I was looking for. Easy to read with my 75 year old eyes and the Indiglo lighting is great!
5,fimex watch,nice looking watch and italso tells the right time my god what will they think of next its mind bogling...
1,Can't set the day / date,"Following the instructions, I can't set the day/date. The stem is supposed to pull out to a position that does this, but no matter how hard I pulled, wouldn't click into place. The stem did finally come all the way out of the watch but I was able to stick it back in with no ill effects."
1,Too tight and not adjustable,I love Timex - it has some key features which even Rolex lacks (Indiglo and day-of-the-week display). But - the elastic band is not adjustable and so tight on my wrist that it hurts. There is nothing else wrong with this watch so it wouldn't be fair to return it. I'll try to give it away to a boy.
4,Justo lo necesario,"Buen precio, caratula de muy buen tamaño (grande), numeros muy claros y grandes y fosforocente con buena luminosidad, es justo lo que necesito para saber la hora."
5,Great deal,I bought this watch for my husband. I have a hard time finding the expandable band watches that he likes. The numbers are really easy to read and the indiglo feature it great and you can't beat the price. Delivery was prompt.
2,A good investment? Not any more,"The watch looks great. However, the price is quite steep. It is beautiful, reliable and keeps accurate time. However, setting the day is a hassle. You have to keep rotating the hands until you get the correct day and time. Setting the date is easy. It is an easy reader watch and ideal for people who have difficulty reading. On the other hand, this watch is quite fragile and has to be protected from getting wet. The band is expandable and looks nice.Update2010 This watch barely lasted two years. The dates do not change. You cannot put back the back cover easily. It just does not close. I had to go to a jeweler just to get the battery changed and put the back cover tightly. I am disappointed. I won't buy another Timex watch."
4,Great value,simple; great value and like it says easy to read and use. very pleased and would recommend this to anyone.
4,"Good watch, but...","Good watch, very clear display. The only inconvenient feature is that it only takes in account 31 days per month, so that you have to be aware of months with 30 and 28 days and make the day number change."
5,Good watch for older eyes,"My husband has been wearing this watch for several months now and really likes it. The large numbers make the dial easy to read and both the day of the week and the date are given. A big bonus is that it includes 24-hour markings, which he personally appreciates. The band is so comfortable he doesn't even notice he is wearing a watch. The backlight, which Timex calls Indiglo, is helpful at night without affecting your night vision. And the best part of all is the very reasonable price for a product that's been around for years and has proven the name Timex means value."
4,Please make 2 versions,"Cost-wise, this is the BEST watch in the world. I have owned several because I always give away my old one (to my nephews and relatives) and then buy a new one the next day. They are delighted to get something that I value enough to wear for myself. I am pleased to get a new model and the low price is something I can afford almost every month.My main complaint is that it comes only with an expansion band -- I have to buy a locking bracelet at additional cost, because that is what I prefer. Please, TIMEX Co. -- sell this item in two versions (expansion band and bracelet). You might be surprised to find customers for the bracelet version. Even if the bracelet version costs a few dollars more, it is more preferable to buying a bracelet separately and then getting rid of the expansion band."
4,timex,"I like this watch, it is easy on the eyes, easy to put on, don't have to worry about the band stretching."
3,"Functional, but difficult to set","The watch keeps good time and the Indiglow on-demand back-lighting is effective. The date and day-of-the-week are a real PITA to set, however. Pulling the stem all the way lets you set the time of day, but there is no AM/PM indicator; pulling it out one click lets you set the numeric date. To set the day of the week, however, requires twisting the time of day multiple revolutions. This is tedious. Here's another bummer: the date flips over a few minutes after midnight, but the day-of-the-week does't finish flipping until about 3am. It took me two full 24-hr cycles to get things set correctly."
3,Hard to Set,"This is a nice watch and I quite like it, but it so hard to set. The time is not that difficult to set but I could not get the date set. The day would simply not change. But I like the way the way time is displayed so I will keep it. In the meantime will try and get the watch I like to get repaired."
5,timex watch,The watch I ordered was just as described on amazon. It looks good and works great. I received the order in a very short time.
4,very nice watch,i had Timex watches before.i was not going to buy Timex again because the gold tone on 2 watches pealed off.so when i saw the Timex all stainless i could not go wrong.i only wish that the band was adjustable. there for i gave it 4 stars ---Pete
5,Great Watch,I bought this as a gift for my grandpa who requested I get him a watch that is easy to read. He loves this watch and can read the hands without putting on his glasses. It even has a date feature which none of his other Timex watches he has owned have. The item came extremely fast and Amazon offered it at the cheapest price.
5,Great Inexpensive Watch,"Pros: Great watch, Keeps perfect time, very readable dial and 10 year battery life.Cons: None that I am aware of."
3,Solid watch,"Solid watch that does what you need it to do. I found the wrist band a little bit uncomfortable, and I take the watch off a lot because of that. I have owned the watch around 3 months and have had to adjust the time twice. It slows down a few minutes a month."
1,setting,this warch is too difficult to set date. I cranked until iwas tired and then returned it and bought another but i like timex and would just buy a little more expensive one.
2,"Good watch, just don't beat on it","For the first 2 months I owned the watch it was flawless - kept perfect time and the Indiglow was VERY bright. This would have been its third full month of service. Somehow water entered the case, first appearing as condensation, and getting worse any time a came near water. Soon after the light shorted out. Then the band broke off. I wore this watch everywhere, including doing automotive repairs... I did not baby it. Would have been a great watch if it didn't leak. Band would have survived if I hadn't played with it so much when I was bored. If it had a screw down crown I would buy another one. (if you're looking for a screwdown crown check out the PXN021 by Pulsar)"
5,Very handy watch!,"I love this watch! I was looking for a handy watch that wasn't too expensive and found this one! Turned out to be the perfect choice for me! I basically wear this watch anywhere and everywhere I go; the gym, school, even at parties! It has a very simple and lovely design and is also very sporty, so you can wear it just about anywhere! The only place I can't wear this watch in, is the swimming pool, since it only has about 30M of water resistance...Strongly recommend this watch for casual wearing!"
3,"Simple, straightforward, works, but beware of wristlet..",Great watch..save for the fact that my wittle wrists are too small for the band! Have not figured out yet how to adjust it
3,inadequate packing,"While this item arrived within the required amount of time, the watch was poorly packaged leaving the box crushed and making it an unattractive package to give as a gift. I had to purchase a separate gift box to accommodate it. The watch has not been opened or set up for use so I have no way of knowing whether it will work or not. Generally I like timex and find them to be a reliable watch for the money. As long as there is no damage done to the watch due to the poor packing then I expect this will be a good watch."
3,Almost gets the man,"I spent many a night listening to John Peel while writing in my London apartment. There wasn't much else in London to listen too. So with interest I purchased the tribute to the great man. His relentless pushing of the Cocteau twins is there as well as John's all time favourite, Teenage Kicks. Inspired choices were Dust my Blues (so representative of the eclectic side of John). The whole of the middle of side one is marred by an over-representation of material mainstream hippy, yes John nodded his head to it, not to this extent.What made this a dissapointment was choosing hits such as Song 2 from Blur, and How Soon is Now from the Smiths, both acknowledged classics. Only I feel John would have flipped over the side and said, lets listen to this.Farewell John, many will miss you, perhaps this album is a reflection of your choices, fantastic hits in a sea of duds."
1,Worst book on this topic,"1 This book failed to mention some most important artillery used in WWII, eg., German 75 mm PAK 40, US 155 mm gun M2""Long Tom"", Soviet 122 mm howitzer, Japanese 70 mm Type 92 infantry gun, etc.2 When introducing the US 155 mm M1 Howitzer (M114), the author offered the picture of a M1918 155 mm Howitzer.3 Failed to mention any mortar, and MLRS."
4,THE ILLUMINATED LANGUAGE OF FLOWERS,I have not yet totally read this book.... it arrived in great condition and i will be more inclined to read it this spring.
5,Buy it Buy iy Buy it and um... BUY IT!,Ok it might look boring but it's not there are three people you can choose from Herc who is strong Jason who... has a sling shotand Atlanta who shoots people with her arrows. I think anyone should buy it.
2,its an average game,"herc's adventure sold in the stores for 20 dollars, the year of its release. i picked it up back then. while i did enjoy this game, it is still an average game. the characters you meet along the way are humours and have their charm. but the ending was only 5 seconds long, and extremely unrewarding. this game has zero replay value.overall decent game, but not worth more than 20 dollars. play a Zelda game instead."
3,WRONG TERRY!!,"how dare you ASSUME the great Mr. Schmeling was a ""Nazi Party Member"" quite the opposite actually. Max NEVER joined the Nazi party and during ""Crystalnacht"" or ""Night of Broken Glass"" in 1938 Berlin, Max hid the 2 young sons of his jewish tailor Henri Lewin in his hotel room at the Excelsior; he did this at great risk to himself and his wife Anny. when asked 50 years later about it, he simply said he did it because ""it was the duty of a man"" Max went on to donate millions to various charities throughout his life and remained life long friends with Joe Louis, and even helped pay for his funeral, since he was destitute, does that sound like a Nazi to you? One of his more famous quotes, in 1992 or 1993 i believe, when asked how he would like to be remebered, he responded ""I dont want anyone to say I was a good athlete, but worth nothing as a human being - I couldnt bear that"" The great Max Schmeling passed 6 weeks ago, rest in peace champ......"
4,Great for toddlers,"My Child loves these, she has 3, Dora, Sponge Bob, and My little Pony. I would love to get more, but have only been able to find these 3. These books keep her busy for a while and shes is enjoying herself. She doesn't mind that each time she plays with it, it is the same picture. Lots of fun for a toddler. Great item."
5,Ranma darling! What happened to your voice!,"It's so funny! Dere's a BIIIIIIG ghost kitty and it sounds cute! It wants to marry Akane at first, buuuuuut theeeeen it notices that Shampoo has the bell and wants to marry her! The ghost kitty gets mad at Ranma, and then it wants to marry hiii...her! I f your confused, nag my friend that you want to borrow it or buy it! HeeHee!"
4,A Must have for all Anime Fans,I thought it was great ! A Definate Must have for all Ranma Fans! Great for probably 7 & up !
2,Not so much revealed...,"Sorry to say, but I was very disappointed with this book. The title promised to tell us ""how to win carnival games and how to make your own games."" The author does tell you how hard, if not impossible, it is to win each game. But he provides very little in the way of how to construct your own practice setup or how to best win the games. He also sites very old statistical data for how often people win - which isn't very often. After reading this book I was more discouraged than anything. My son wanted to learn how to win the big prizes, but this book's message is mostly ""Don't bother, kid, you'll lose."""
4,Super Reader,"Time has moved on in the Anno Dracula world, and a World War hasstarted. Dracula, fiend that he is, is fighting for Germany. At leastby proxy, anyway, as shapeshifting vampires like the Red Baron reallydon't need too much in the way of planes.Edwin Winthrop is the protagonist here, and the new agent must leadthe charge to stop The Bloody Red Baron and friends. G-8 and mateswould be very handy, here.Others must try and counter the pen of the vampire Poe, also working for Germany."
3,Toothless Vampire Story,"This book is based on a strong idea which should have provided the superstructure for a great novel.Unfortunately, most of the book is filler.And about half way through, you get that Robert Ludlum feeling - I can sense all the main characters moving towards each other for a cheesy climax.Very very disappointing.The most interesting characters didnt figure much because of a lack of imagination.If you compare this with the intensity of Anne Rice, its a very very weak show - a shame.Most pointedly, Dracula is actually NOT scarey. How can they be?"
5,One of my favorites ever,"I originally had this album on cassette, and recently remembered it, and replaced it with a CD. Every song is a gem, all truly beautiful songs."
3,like it for the design of the bottle,"i bought this for a friend, and the first thing he said was how great the bottle looked. but the scent doesn't really follow. i was a little bit disappointed. i like Bvlgari cologne but this one is a little bit too strong. next time i'll make sure i can try it before i buy a cologne, for me or anyone. Great price though"
3,It's ok,The bottle was not round like this picture it was rectangular shaped. It is extreemly strong smelling I got the smell on me just handling the unopened package. It has a sweet woodsy pine smell. It does smell good but it isn't a must have will probably try a different man smell for my husbands next present.
1,why mend don't listen & women cant read,I bought this hoping to add to the quaility of my marriage. I could not get my husband to listen to it and I had a hard time listening to it myself. Seemed very adolescent and juvenile like it was written for children.
4,Great basic pocket reference,"Overall this is a great pocket reference for a new to intermediate PC technician working towards A+ (so therefore does exactly what it says!).However, some of the photos are misplaced (or mislabled). This is fine if you know what the item is supposed to look like, but not so good for the beginner.That is the only reason it lost a star from me.I would suggest tougher proof reading before the next edition.However, I continue to use this book on a day to day basis and think you will find it a very useful resource! Recommended!"
5,THE BEST MOVIE YOU'LL EVER READ,"This book is a must own for any fan of Matsumoto. If you are unfamiliar with his work, this is a great place to start.Taiyo's work is not your typical big-eyed, blue-haired, sobby school-girl anime. Rather, it is contemplative and cinematic.Taiyo's books have always had that cinematic quality, but this book really shows what a great story teller he is.The pacing is thoughtful, the action is explosive, and the drawings are to die for! Don't let the scribbly, unrefined line work fool you. THIS MAN CAN DRAW!Just buy it. Before you know it, you will be searching for every story he has ever done. I did."
2,MiJam Drummer,They looked cool and sounded like a great idea but my kids NEVER played with them. I think they are meant for much older (not 5th grade) kids. My kids just kept beating on the table or counter or something annoying!
1,Disappointed,"My 13 year old daughter asked for these for Christmas. She was so excited to see that she had received them. We put the batteries in and tried them right away. They do not work! We both tried them with no success. Out of about 20 wrist movements, we heard the drum sound maybe 5 times! We worked with it for about 30 minutes and then gave up. The product is terrible. We returened it to the store the next day. What a huge disappointment! Don't waste your money!"
2,disappointed,The Mijam drumsticks purchased for Christmas don't work well at all. This pair just doesn't seem to initiate the drum sound when applying motion. The cymbal sound works. I will be returning this product.Brett
2,didn't work when arrived,"I bought this as a gift for my nephew. Unfortunately it didn't work when it arrived, but fortunately my sister in law was able to take it to a local discovery store and exchange it for one that worked fine."
2,MiJam Drumsticks,"I purchased this for my daughter age 13 for Christmas. She opened them and not one of my 5 kids or their friends have touched them again!They do not work unless you hit them on something and then you think you are going to break them! Go buy a drum set, it would be more fun!!!"
4,must be plugged into speakers or headphones,We almost sent these back - thinking they did not work - but then discovered that they must be plugged into some sort of speaker or headphone to be heard (duh!) - but I wonder how many other people have made the same mistake.
3,Sizeing is off.,"I love the look of these, but they run a little small. Suggest you order a 1/2 to a full size larger depending on the type of sock you may or may not wear with them."
5,"Poco ""The Last Roundup""",This is an amazing live reocording that contains all of the energy and musical and vocal talent that made Poco a standoout band of the 70s. THEY RICHLY DESERVE TO BE INDUCTED IN THE MUSIC HALL OF FAME!
3,Poco - the last roundup,"Read the reviews; purchased the CD. It was wonderful to see an unreleased live Poco concert available after many years in the can. But let's be honest, the breathless Reviews I read before purchasing the CD were a bit over the top. Yes, it is a good recording, but the CD suffers because several weak songs were included (in an effort not to duplicate the previous live recordings?). There are some real gems, some real keepers, on this CD, but because of the filler material, it is not a great one. Your best bet: invent a time machine and attend a Poco concert in person."
5,A great book,"I've been struggling with depression, anxiety, and nightmares for most of my life, but I never really understood what it was. This book described my illness almost exactly. At times, it felt like the authors were reading my mind. At other times, they wrote about stuff that I'd never considered but which was still really helpful. It goes into some of the medical aspects of PTSD, but the book is always clear, even for us laypeople. I can't recommend this book highly enough."
3,A simplistic Q&A book about PTSD,"For people who don't know much about PTSD this is a good book. I found it to be rather simplistic but it did cover a lot of material related to PTSD. Buy it if you're newly diagnosed, it will help. Don't buy it if you've moved on to books that help with treatment, this one won't."
3,broken hub,"great idea, space, shape, ventilation and vestibules seemed lovely. the hub broke on our first trip out however, and this pretty much negated the quick setup. it did stay up and was only slightly shape distorted (only one drip from fabric touching). a hinge flipped backwards as well, and would Not Go Back. So a little wet there too. If the parts were solid I'd recommend it to anyone - the zipper's loud, and it's hard to put away correctly at first, and the hub and hinge broke. all of this could be manufacturing issues and i had bad luck, or it could have been design. I wish it had not broken, as it was otherwise ideal for me and my partner (primarily car campers). quite roomy for two folks and airbed and gear, though-"
5,Why.....Cause they ROCK!,"I've been a fan of Tribe 8 for a while, and recently I even got to see them live! These chicks are like no other. ALL their albums are great and totally moshworthy!!! If you think they're good on cd...you should see them live. Cant say enough about it."
3,Spidey 2 Review for GC,"The web-slinging takes some practice, so does learning the city. But once you do, this is a decent game. I'm eager to play the next one though."
4,very very good but not the best movie title in the world,it is an amazing translation of movie to game that is totally free form. now i really think i enjoyed the return of the king game probably a bit more although that is a very different style of game.it doesnt technically bring anything new to the table except the biggest part of the game free form web slinging its a great game but unless you have alot of excess cash around wait till the price drop in a few monthsor by it used off this great website. this is only an opinion for those idiotsc who take things to seriesly. thats a spelling error.
5,This is more like it.,"This will be one of the best games out this year. First off, the game-play has been completly reworked, and now you can atcually drop all the way to the streets without dieing. Its a seemless world like Jak II now too. They added a ""random crime"" thing where there are minor crimes that go off at times, and you can choose to stop them or just ingnore them. Also, scripted missions, that follow the movie plot. All in all this game will be awsome.Graphics 5/5Sound (Don't know, havn't heard it)Control ?(great)?Overall - 5/5Also, the Swing system has been fixed, so the webs don't just dissapear into the sky above you, it is actuall swining, where the web has to connect to the buildings. They made sure this works too."
4,This game is the BEST!!!!! Well... there's that minor detail,"How can Spidey run (yeah, like only on his feet) up walls? He doesn't have the sticky things on his feet! Other than that, this game ROCKS! I spent hours just swinging around and listning to the people below yelling ""Look! Spider-Man!"" and ""Hey, Spidey!"". What's really cool is that if your web doesn't have something to attach to, Spidey falls! Unlike the last game, where you could soar through the skies on nothing. The graphics are smooth, and you can run on the ground. The programmers even went to such details, like gravity, and the length of the web. If you wait for too long to make your web, you actually touch down while still holding on to the web! So, in short, buy this game!"
3,Way Too Easy,"Spidey 2 is a fun game, but I beat it a couple days after I bought it. I would have only rented it if I knew it were so easy. There goes 50 bucks."
5,Lookin' good web slinger,This game is really funny and is awesome because you can go anywhere and do anything you want! Spidey has new moves and old enemies. Its like grand theft auto but with spiderman. You could go on rooftops and on the streets! I thought Spiderman 2 was going to be good and is better than good. Its a good game to buy on the gamecube console.
2,A good game but way too short,"Spiderman 2 is a great game for the first couple hours that you play it. After that it just gets boring. Even before you beat the whole game. Of course you still have the extras that you can play but thats just not worth the money. Now dont get me wrong, Im a big Spidey fan and this game does have its thrillers. The amount of satisfaction that I get tying bad guys up and leaving them hanging on poles almost makes it worth it. Almost."
3,awesome game,"This is an excellent game. The swinging,the jumping. Everything is great.Go and buy it!"
3,SO SO,The game is okay it is fun but not reel fun. Let me show you the good and the bad. Good do anything spider man can with new moves. Battle doc ock. go anywhere and interact with anyone and anything. The bad. I did not no that spider man saveed baloons. new york is a safe place now but in this game a bad thing hapens all the time. THE game is bad. and that is why i dont like it
5,AWSOME,"I hope that they will have it some what like the first one in a sense, because the last one had a secret store with extras like the movies and bonus features (character change). I hope this time that it gives you the same thing except for the Green Goblin. Instead hopefully they will give you Doc Oc. (Doctor Octopus). He is right now my favorite character except for Spiderman of course. His tenticles are so cool. I wish there was some ways to let the people know because it would be so cool to be able to use his tenticles when ever. I mean they could do just like on the first one with the green goblin with most of his moves, but with Doc Oc instead."
3,Gather Round & Destroy All Our Records (Dig) The Pulses,"Wasn't really impressed with the band. Too much of a mix of styles of music. There were a couple of tracks that were interesting. I based my purchase on other reviews, so I thought I better add my two cents. I'll be more leery of reviews in the future."
5,Simple to use.,Wanted a simple non-complicated stopwatch for time keeping.Big digits is a must.Working nice on both counts for me.
4,Like tactile feedback and large display,"I paid a couple of more bucks for this unit because of the above. I've used it on and off for about a year and it is well worth they money.Minor complaint--the process for viewing and recording split times is a bit disingenuous, especially if you need to record them. When you hit ""split,"" the most recent split time stays on the display even after you hit ""stop."" In order to see total time you need to hit ""split"" again. Once you do that, you can no longer view the lap times. This means that if you have more than one lap time, you'll need to record it in between laps."
3,Excellent stopwatch ... except ....,"Great stopwatch in every way, except the red colored one I have ""bleeds"" red all over hot, sweaty hands, and therefore gets on clothing, etc. Other than that, it has simple, intuitive controls, highly visible numbers, and a great, tactile and audible ""click"" which means you don't have to look down to assure you've started or stopped the timing. If I lost it, would get another, but probably the clear-colored model."
3,An okay stopwatch but there are better choices,"This ACCUSPLIT Pro Survivor - A601X Stopwatch measures 2-3/8 inches wide and 3 inches high. The lanyard is about 23 inches long. The stopwatch fits into my palm perfectly. The digits are between inch to 7/16 inch high. They are readily visible. There are three buttons on top with the Start/Stop button on the right, the Split/Reset on the left, and the Mode button in the middle. There is a digital clock. This Accusplit does not have any memory. The user can do as many split times as he wishes between start and stop, but every time he presses the split button, the previous split time is lost. This stopwatch does what is designed to do well, but for a few dollars more, one can get a much more versatile stopwatch with lap and split time, backlight, clock, alarm, and plenty of memories. Check it out @Ultrak 360 Stopwatch."
3,Very hard to program,"Sorry, it can't be just me but I am unable to program the thing to act as a watch. Stop watch works OK but other than reset, start and stop I can't make it do anything it's supposed to."
1,Can't see past Split times!!!,"Be careful!! As one reviewer said, you cannot go back and see what the split times were! My son is doing triathlons and in tris you measure six times: swim, transition, bike, transition, run and overall.Yes, I presumed since it measured split times AND is called Accusplit that I could go back and see those times.Maybe its a good stop watch for the right needs. But won't anyone who orders a split stopwatch want to go back and see the splits?"
4,Affordable with an Easy to Read Display,Affordable with an Easy to Read Display. The only problem I have with this stop watch is that it always stays on. I would rather extend the life of the battery by being able to turn it off.
5,Good Stopwatch,"I use this simply for the stopwatch. Other than that I don't know much about the other settings, but the numbers are easy to see with a huge display screen, it has a nice long rope for wearing around your neck, and it is durable and works great! I am very pleased with this product!"
1,Deceptive warranty,"I received the stopwatch today. On the back of the stopwatch, it says: ""Through Mar 2009: free service; Apr 2009-Mar 2013: $10 fee for service; After Mar 2013: $10 fee for service may not be available.""Seems more than deceptive to me. First, it is now November 2009, so I'd have to pay for ""warranty"" no matter what. This means that their 5-year warranty is total nonsense. Second, the stopwatch costs them less than $10 to manufacture, so the ""$10 fee for service"" is really a new purchase to the manufacturer---they are simply going to take the opportunity to sell you a new one during the so-called warranty period. Third, a ""$10 fee for service"" is a total rip-off since a new stopwatch could cost you less than $10 if you buy a different brand, buy at the right time, etc.All in all, while the stopwatch seems ok (as in average, what I expect, etc.), don't be taken in by the claims of a ""5-year warranty."" There isn't one."
2,"No on/off button, aged when received","There are two things fundamentally wrong with this stop watch:1. It doesn't have an on/off button, so it keeps sucking energy from the battery; and it does that2. from its birth somewhere in a factory and all the time it's sitting on Amazon.com's shelf until you receive it.What that means practically: you receive a stopwatch with a much shorter battery life than what you paid for (this stopwatch is not cheap!). In my case, the stopwatch (judging from the 5-year warranty dates on the back) was already 12 months old by time I received it. Disappointing. I returned the stopwatch and am looking for one with an on/off button. How difficult can that be??"
1,Decent,I think it was a pretty good product.What's with this word requirement? It is very irritation to meet expectations.
1,NOTHING BUT HYPE! DOES LESS THAN MOST DIGITAL WATCH,"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007ZOGEO/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_titleI'M TELLING YOU, MOST WRIST DIGITAL WATCHES HAVE MORE. THIS A SINGLE COUNT WATCH, YES YOU CAN SPLIT IT'S NOT WORTH THE MONEY FOR TRULY WHAT YOU GET! HONEST ! IT DOESN'T COUNT DOWN, NOTHING AUDIBLE ON IT."
3,Beware of 5 year warranty claim,"Great product but DO NOT purchase for the 5 year warranty. Warranty is to the date stamped on back of product NOT from purchase date. I received the stopwatch today, July 18th 2012. The warranty expiration date on the product is March 2013. So instead of a 5 year warranty I have a 7 month warranty. Not the biggest of deals but felt like deceptive marketing."
4,Stopwatch Accusplit,"Easy to hold comfortable, is light weight, easy to use buttons, draw backs for my purpose needed a lit display this does not have that http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007ZGZWU/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title"
5,Very helpful,This book provides helpful information as I tutor young people of that generation in job hunting and preparation for interviews.
4,Mel B Hacks At Estranged Husband With 'Tell Me',"First here is the track listing: (1) TELL ME ALBUM VERSION (2) TELL ME UNTOUCHABLES REMIX (3) TELL ME NDB REMIX + Fold-out Poster of Melanie B. The Untouchables remix is 80's like. Bells are added, along with a wicked bass line when she sings verse 1, this follows through most of the song. The NDB remix has a simple beginning rap beat, and the tone sounds similiar to Victoria Beckham's featured song with Dane Bowers and True Steppers ""Out Of Your Mind."" Marimba bell-part (which is the bass line) goes along with the beat. The song seems a little slow at first...but when Mel starts singing...her lyrics are a lot quicker than the orginal version. Definate workout beat and tune. The Chorus is repeatative with the intro, and this creates a kewl effect! The lyrics of the song is basically a hack back at Jimmy Gulzar, suggesting to the listener that he continually lied to Melanie. A GREAT buy if you like Melanie B!"
1,This work is not about Shakespeare,"I have read almost all of the works in the Past Masters series. This is by far the worse. I do not ordinarily write about books I do not like. But this work truly deserves a bad word. It is not about Shakespeare , but rather about Germaine Greer. She simply did not do the assignment that she was given."
5,excellent series,"i really enjoyed the characters throughout the Black Blood Brothers series. My only complaint is that it ended WAY too soon. Only 12 episodes to really delve into all that was happening with Jiro, his brother, Cassa (who's a real piece of work) and all of the other characters that live in the Special Zone. There are 10 different yards (sections) that the various residents live in. But there's talk of an eleventh yard that has everyone buzzing and hunting for something that may or may not be there.Overall i really started to get attached to the characters, the animation was on point and the story about the various types of vampires and how they interact with the humans in the city. It made it that much better..again i just wished that it lasted longer than it did. I can only hope that they continue this in the near future. No question though, Black Blood Brothers is a series that you really should check out."
5,BEST LIVE ALBUM!,"This has got to be one of the *BEST* live albums... No fluff, no bonus stuff, just some down home ROCK from the one and only KID!"
5,Holy Sh*t,"Oh my fu**ing God!!!! Unbelievable This capture what people out thier need to experience. One big thrill ride from beginning to end besides that sh*tty song in the middle called ""Picture"" Where is ""Jackson"" Kid? Anyways by the small glitch it makes you feel like u are their. Unbelievable can't wait to go in a week. I'll be high drunk and living the good life. Keep Rocking Kid. Definately the best live album out there PERIOD."
5,great!,"Saw Kid Rock Live -He is amazing. this album lets you ""be"" at his concert without being there, its simply Great!!"
3,Good but no classic,"If you want a decent collection of Kid Rock tracks then this is a good start, but I prefer live recordings to add a bit extra - some of improvisation, maybe a few long solos. This is just a sample of his CD tracks performed in front of a crowd, so if you have all the CDs I'd give it a miss. This adds nothing."
5,REALLY SHOWS OFF TWISTED BROWN TRUCKER,i am not a big live album fan but this album gives you the feel of a kid rock concert which is where kid really shines i became a fan after seeing a concert i wish the album had more of the songS where they go off into say a ac/dc song or some random song which is my favorite part of a kid rock concert CANT WAIT FOR NEW STUDIO ALBUM WHICH RICK RUBIN IS PRODUCING
3,Watch Out! We're Being Invaded!... By Great Music!!,"You'll find the War Of The Worlds Soundtrack a Delight to the ears, A Great Score that will take you on a frightening Musical Journey of an Invasion of Planet Earth and the attempted destruction of Human Kind, enhanced by the Great Voice of Legendary Actor Morgan Freeman you'll be transported to a Battle for Survival against Cruel Aliens who see us as nothing more than food. From the near end of our kind to the final victory of the aliens ""By the littlest creatures that God in his Wisdom put upon this Planet"" to quote the Author. If your a Fan like me of great soundtracks or just one who loves great music, you'll enjoy this soundtrack."
5,A Brilliant Work,"I will begin by telling you that this score is either for people with interesting taste, or a film score fanatic. I fit in both categories.This soundtrack is extremely dark, atmospheric, and at times tragically beautiful.Tracks 5 and 3 are sure to bring a tear to your eye. The others will have your heart racing, pumping your blood quickly as you EXPERIENCE the suspense of the film in a way only John Towner Williams can simulate.A must have."
3,War of the Worlds,"I have to admit it I am a John Williams fan not just his work on Star Wars but others like the Cowboys and the Patriot (one of my favourites). In this score Mr Williams does not let you down. It is a sweeping almost Wagnarian composition with a hint of menace that fans of his Star Wars scores will regognise. Nothing new here but Mr Williams is at his best with this type of film, remember Jaws?Whilst this score is not as memorable or will become as regonisable as Jaws and Star Wars it never the less is most enjoyable."
5,John Williams Is The Composers Composer,I never fail to be amazed by the quality of the music that John Williams brings forth time and time again...This score is another fine example of another perfect Williams classic...Any John Williams collection would be imcomplete without it...I give this score my highest rating...
3,Starts out great then goes south,This series starts out fantastic. Ploog's artwork is awesome and the retelling of the classic Frankenstein story works well. Once that ends though it hits very troubled waters. Doug Moench decided somewhere along the way that his narration would be a better way to convey the thoughts and feelings of the Monster and that's where the whole series just tapers off to garbage. Frankenstein's Monster spends most of the series trying to track down and kill a seemingly endless supply of Frankenstein heirs. Anyone who befriends him is doomed the second they become friends which makes the Monster angry....rinse lather repeat. For such a low price it's a fun read but disappointing that it had such wasted potential. It could have been AWESOME.
3,When will it come out in color?,"After reading that artist Mike Ploog has done some recent (2008) work on the revitalized ""Spirit"" title, my memory was jogged and I was reminded how much I dug Ploog's work in the 1970s, particularly his work at the start of Marvel's ""Frankenstein"" series. Sadly, these cheesy black-and-white reprints are the only version available (other than back-issues) of those great early issues. I'd love to see Ploog's fluid style again, but I guess I'll wait until they pony up for full-on color reprints... Otherwise, why bother? And, yeah, it's true that this series fell into utter mediocrity, but those first issues were really great. I loved them as a kid!"
4,Great collection of 70's horror comics,"The 70's horror craze in comics didn't last long, but if you were a kid then, it was great. Gary Frederick and Mike Ploog did an excellent job of adapting Mary Shelley's novel and providing a sequel to launch an ongoing series. Unfortunately, the series suffered from a lack of supporting characters and was never as successful as others like Tomb of Dracula and Werewolf by Night. Still, this book contains the entire series, as well as the b&w magazine stories the were published simultaneously."
5,Instantly Useful,"Messrs. Rivkin and Seitel serve up a veritable feast of practical ways to stimulate ideas. A central theme is the importance of borrowing -- and transforming -- existing ideas. Theirs is a sort of modern updating of Horace's definition of creativity as being ""A new blend of familiar ingredients."" Nice company to keep, guys."
2,Good music? Of course. Worth buying? No.,"Okay, if you're a Radiohead completist you're going to buy this CD regardless. But it's not worth the cash IMO.Don't get me wrong, the songs are excellent as usual. ""Just"" is one of my favorite tracks from The Bends. And the ""Mogadon version"" of Killer Cars is a very interesting interpretation, almost a single-worthy mix.But you already have ""Just"", and if you have ""Killer Cars"" on another CD single or bootleg it's not worth buying. Radiohead are known for releasing b-side gems to their fans on their singles; this one falls short of better efforts like ""Fake Plastic Trees [US #2]"", ""Street Spirit (Fade Out) [UK #2]"" or ""Pyramid Song Pt.1""."
3,Good information,This is a good source for reconsidering the impartiality of sentencing and incarceration practices in the United States. Very revealing material
1,Typical paranoid nonsense.,"Typical left wing ""vast right wing conspiracy"" nonsense. Only the most paranoid Americans looking through the peepholes of triple locked doors would recognize the place this book is about and apparently from where it was written."
5,My son with apraxia loves this CD,This song is almost always in our car's cd player. My son who is 3 and has apraxia never sang before I purchased this CD. He loves the songs and the slower tempo allows him to sing along. He now is starting to sing along with his friends in class which he never had the confidence to do before. I would highly recommend this cd.
3,loud instrumental/background music,"The lyrics are sung slowly but the backround/instrumental music a bit too loud so it drowns the lyrics some of the time. The arrangements are also a bit more for adults--a bit too jazzy or intermittently loud for a child, when the enunciation of the lyrics should be the emphasis.Would also be more appealing to a child if a child and NOT an adult would sing the songs...like the Wee Sing Mother Goose songs where every song is clearly sung by a child--this CDis what I would suggest instead. Even an adult will appreciate the pleasant-sounding arrangements of this particular Wee Sing CD....NOT so with the Time to Sing CD's"
3,Time to Sing II,I purchased this cd to use with kids coming to my private speech pathology. It is good. It does have a very slow rate for each song which is ideal for kids with a language delay
1,Please turn it off!,"My son has a speech disorder but he managed to say ""Turn it off!"". I guess it was helpful in that respect. The words are very choppy and unnatural sounding. I would not recommend this CD."
3,Not the best,"A decent compilation, but I ended up deleting about half the cuts from this double album. Not my particular cup of tea."
3,Good bulletin board.,"Just received this for new home office remodel. It looks absolutely beautiful. However, the bulletin board part is not as sturdy or thick as the ugly ones you see at Walmart. Every time I pin something to the board it pushes in the whole area around where I am tacking. The cork part is not flush with wall - there is an empty space between corkboard and wall while the frame touches the wall. That being said we ordered the 48"" x 36"" and it may seem a bit flimsy because of the sheer size of the board. Frame solid, cork part not so much. Also the cork is actually a very thin coating over another type of board."
5,"Classy, good looking bulletin board",This board was perfect for what we wanted for our office [in the home] - something that didn't scream 'cheap and utilitarian'. Like the photo it has a beautiful natural wood frame at top and bottom with black painted wood on the sides. It looks expensive and is more expensive than the standard issue. Very nice!
5,Great Cookbook,"I love this cookbook. The recipes are simple and delicious. I use it all the time. If you are looking for some great cookie recipes or a simple cookbook, buy this book- you won't regret it."
4,Blues Piano made easy,"This is really quite a good book. Concepts are explained quite well, and the exercises fit the concept they are trying to get across. Blues piano is not rocket science but it does have an important part. This book gives you a good start in understanding it.The CD does not add a lot of value. It is cheesy MIDI computer sound at its worst. I think if they would have used a real accoustic piano, or even a better sampled sound with a good MIDI controller, you might get a better feel for what the exercises are really supposed to sound like."
1,Microscope not included,"You can't read the notation on the Kindle screen. And there's no way I can find to make the images larger.Hey, Amazon! -- You should refund everyone's money who bought this book for Kindle. The format doesn't work."
4,Just what I Needed,"I have not had lessons but have been ""fooling around"" on the piano for years. I wanted to get a better dose of theory under my belt and have the ability to play things differently, and perhaps become good enough to play with other people! This book started out basic enough for me and it goes well beyond my current capabilities. This is exactly what I was looking for: a stepwise and slow progression through major scales, pentatonic, blues and mixolydian scales. I had heard of these things, but NOW I understand them. The CD also helps as you play along. I can recommend this book to anyone who is starting out in blues style piano. With this book the only thing standing between me and great blues is a lot of practice! But now I have a good pace and direction, and with that the practicing will be a lot more efficient than it has been."
5,an excellent value,"Having returned to keyboards after many years' absence, I wanted something that I could use to improve my basic sight reading skills and build my knowledge base of blues piano. This instruction book does both admirably. It is chocked full of information, which starts out very basic and increases in difficulty as it goes. Each lesson is on the CD, which is very helpful when simply counting out the measures doesn't quite capture the feel of the music. Each lesson is thoroughly analyzed and explained in terms of chord structure and rhythm. I am about 1/2 way through the book, and have found it useful to go back and review older lessons.Make no mistake. This guide is not for the absolute keyboard beginner. Basic sight reading skills are necessary. And the most important ingredient to success is, not surprisingly, practice!Looking forward to purchasing other guides in this Keyboard Series."
5,fun book,"easy to read, lots of content, comes with CD so you can hear the examples your tying to learn. Fun book and the price is great."
5,Great for learning blues techniques,This is an excellent book for learning how to play the blues. It includes music theory and clear explanations of various styles. The accompanying CD is very helpful and ends with 7 full songs in differing styles.
5,Awsome,"Love theses very sharp and useful for grooming and stripping , on dogs I would recommend. This product to any one who grooms dogs for shows ."
5,Excellent tool,Excellent tool but does require some practice to learn to use it if you have never used it before. I recommend this without reservation.
4,One to be read,I found this book very exciting and well worth my time and money. I could not put it down.
2,Extremely lacking for a preperation book,"This book contains CCRN type questions with explanations of their answers seperated by body systems. Then toward the end of the book there are a few practice exams. There is no review of the body systems outside of the question format, so basically its just a book with a 1,000 CCRN questions. Unless you have passed CCRN in the past and just looking for extra test questions to get you in the mindset of taking the CCRN, the book is pretty worthless."
5,One of Austin's Shining Stars,"Alejandro Escovedo is one of the best of a group of talented singer/songwriters from Austin, TX. Along with Joe Ely and Stephen Bruton (who produced and played on Gravity), Escovedo writes and sings some of the most thoughtful and inpsired music anywhere. Gravity's main strengths lie in words and music that when combined, put the listener in the same mood you imagine he must have been in when the song was penned. It's a rare gift that many songwriters try for but miss the mark on most occasions. Another plus on Gravity is Bruton's stellar playing and producing. Bruton is among the best guitar players anywhere, and Gravity shows off his feel for this music. Alejandro Escovedo is a rare gem, and deserves a much larger following than he currently has. I highly recommend this album."
5,"Great Book, but a bit monotonous","I found this book to be very inspiring and hard to put down. In fact my running suffered from having too little sleep!However, I the author glosses over a number of things I would have really liked to hear more about, such as the diet of these cross country runners (only mentioned a few times) and especially the reasons for the training performed on a given day. In many cases, the latter is referred to, but never explained in more detail.Overall, I would definitely recommend it to anyone interested in running XC, middle, or long distances."
4,"Great read for runners, especially X-C","As a lifelong runner, competitive XC runner and former coach, I loved this book. Any serious XC runner is going to be thrilled with this book and be able to overlook its many errors and marginal story telling. Heck, most of us are tickled that a book was written about our sport! If you are a runner- especially XC, this story will motivate and amaze you.I doubt any non runner or somebody with a literary hangup will enjoy this book due to its faults that are outlined by other reviewers. It certainly could of been much better, but I am just happy that the story was told.Somewhere on the cover or insert (it's been a year since I read this book), a reviewer compares this book to Once A Runner by John Parker. I would not rate this book that high, however after 20+ years of running and reading, this is the book that came closest to it.I think this is a great book for runners of all ages, but especially HS and college runners."
4,Great read for past and present X-C runners!!,"This was almost a training log for a team of cross-country runners at the collegiate level. Very good reading though for former and current runners with some great motivational stuff in in, too! Made me miss my former X-C days and also want to go out and run right away, albeit at a much slower pace then the guys in the book!! I recommend it to all cross-country fans."
4,Good read,"Got this book primarily for the insight into how a top level college team trains and was not disappointed. Has a lot of detailed information about the workouts and race strategies, as well as the runners themselves and their injuries.Well written, and a good story, but better if you like to get lots of mile times with your stories. A bit more clinical feeling than a book like Born to Run."
5,"Insights on the grueling, competitive sport","Sports fans will relish Running With The Buffaloes, an insider's survey of the University of Colorado men's cross country team, which represents the journalist author's season of access to the best cross country team in America. Insights on the grueling competitive sport include personal as well as team player experiences."
2,A disappointment,"Perhaps my hopes were too high, but I found the very numerous typographical and grammatical errors throughout the book to be beyond distracting. While some of the information presented was interesting and inspiring, the overall ""insight"" the book provides is extremely limited. Additionally, it is poorly written. I'm sorry I purchased it."
4,Good read,As a former DI X-C/track distance runner this book brought me back. Lear captures the team dynamics and the result is a nice story.
3,"Good story, not well written",This is a very dry techinical report on one teams growth and success. It alsomst seems to be a full length school newsletter with some side stories. Definitley humbling for the average runner.
5,Should be made into a movie,This is one of the best books that I have ever read.Read the entire book in three days. Had a hard time putting thebook away. This book should be made into a movie.Similiar to River runs through it.Met the author just the other day. Chris Lear is a greatwriter and an outstanding individual.This book is highly recommended.
3,"A great read, but a case study in poor coaching","As a running fan, I found the book to be a compelling read.As a coach I was very concerned about obvious over-training that Coach Mark Wetmore puts his athletes through, and the lack of discipline in the program where many sessions end up in a competition rather than the original intent of the program.The consequence for the athletes is an epidemic of injuries that limit both their college careers and running later in life."
4,Nice Read,"This book is really cool. Being a high school runner, I could identify with it very much. Definitely worth checking out."
3,Good stuff,"Used to write a game ""Is it in the Bible"" and wow do my people need to read their Bibles, but then I wonder if I hadn't been the one writting the quiz how would I have done.Good book, I doubt I'm related to Rick Osborne and I would say after reading this he is much more liberal in his Bible than I. But a very good read"
4,Dave and Dave,"Nothing wrong here---just to note that this Dave Gardner is a musician, not the 50's comedian Dave Gardner I wanted."
5,Great book!,"My son needed help with writhing, so his teacher recommended buying this book. This book does it job. Great book and service!"
4,Good but not daily,"This is good for 4th, 5th, even 6th graders. It has only 4 days a week (Monday through Thursday), so it's best suited for after school homework. I let my 5th grader do all 4 days together on Saturday because each day is just 1/4 of one whole article or story."
3,About time,All I can say is it is about freaking time. We waited 2 or 3 years for season 3 to finally make its way to dvd. Sony is so slow in putting out some of their series. I hope season 4 gets a release a lot sooner than season 3 did. Very happy to finally get season 3.
4,great show from my childhood.,"When i was 10 yrs old in 1970 i remember watching the partridge family on tv. It was my favorite show very entertaining,funny and the music was great.I was delighted to hear that it came out on dvd thats the reason why i ordered it. season three was especially special to me maybe because of the memories i had as a child alot of the situations on the show happened to me in real life.I cant wait until the fourth season comes out on dvd the show only ran for 4 seasons i only wish they could have made more if you love the partridge family as much as i do i hope youll buy any or all of the seasons that amazon.com has to offer."
4,The Partridge Family,"Excellent; I forgot just how funny this television show was. My teenagers laughed all the way through the series. It is good, clean, family entertainment!"
4,Excellent for kids,"Clean fun with 1970's musical family adventures and humor. My special needs adult daughter watches these endlessly, as she watched the series as a child."
4,Convergence: A great book from a Christ loving Calvinist,"This is a great book. Sam Storms has shown that a passion for Truth and a desire for experiential manifestations of the Truth are not at odds with one another, at least they should not be. Storms shares some absolutely amazing in-breaking(s) of the Kingdom of God that he has witnessed that should encourage all believers alike. If you are reformed in your soteriology and think that this means you must be a cessationist, think again. Storms is a gift to the body of Christ. Storms is one of those individuals whom God in His providence is using to help unite the body of Christ. If you have been blessed by Grudem, Piper, and Mahaney than I think that you will be blessed by the writings of this man who has a passion for the supremacy of God in all things."
5,Jerusha Bailey is back in charge.,"Rules of Commnad kept me turning page after page, I had to know if Bailey would be able to pull out of this one and keep her crew alive. A terrific read, great for the beach days to come."
3,Not what i thought.,"THIS IS NOT A HOW-TO and give very little actual info on body painting like the description says. It does feature an attractive young lady, who paints herself. It is really more for people who enjoy looking at artistic nudity. It's fun to watch but is not helpful. If the description had said it was a video showing artistic nudity of an attractive female painting herself and then showering down, i would probably give it 5. It is still fun to watch but since it does not have the educational information it claims to have, i can only give it a three."
3,"Refreshing, folksy, comedy spoof country-western music","For those who like Monte Python and Tom Lehrer, you will find this more subtle and less corny, but every bit as enjoyable. The music is Texas Western, not surprising considering the group shows its roots or affinity for Austin in its title. It is easy listening humor, that if one weren't paying attention one might think only to be second rate country...until you hear the lyrics!"
1,No Sound !!! Why sell something like this ?,I don't understand how these ever made it to market. They are cheaply made in China and they come with virtually NO SOUND. I am not kidding you. I thought it was a good deal since it came with a carrying case but I sure was wrong.The only good review you will find on these units is from the poor sellers who bought a bunch of them and are trying to sell them as fast as they can before the word gets out that these players are defective !!!And try to get Protron's customer service to help you! That is a nightmare in itself!
1,piece of garbage,"This is the worst online purchasing experience I've ever had. I bought this unit online, paid for expediting delivery, and it came in late, which I didn't complain about. The unit worked only ONCE, and the power never turns on any more. Called the customer service, and they said I should call whom I purchased it from. I was like a ball being kicked around with no help. Finally SpectonIQ agreed to pick up my unit at their cost and send me a new one. Three weeks has passed, and they still haven't sent UPS to pick up this trash. I'm going to file complaint to BBB. Hope they send me a good replacement and go out of business."
2,Not really Portable!,"I found no flaw in the basic operation of these units, screen display was good.BUT, this unit is really not what I would call PORTABLE. To me PORTABLE means battery operation as an option.These two units must be attached to electric power at all times....there is NO BATTERY operation at all.In fact the auxilliary screen cannot be used at all outside the car. That is because the CAR power adapter has a split cord that attaches to each screen individually to power. But the inside DC cord has only one jack----so only the main screen can get power and the auxiliary screen can get no power to operate.So if you only want a split screen dvd player for a RUNNING CAR you are okay. Wish that this was spelt out in the description before I purchased!!!"
4,All the windex incarnadine,"Josh turned thirty-eight on Tuesday. There was no celebration as he shuffled from room to room in the sixty-story office building. Most didn't even know him by name but rather only by his phone extension; a number they'd only use if the toilets were backed up. Josh never married, and after his mother became ill, he became so preoccupied with her care that he never even bothered to date. His mother, who had raised him alone passed away on his thirty-third birthday, and every year on this very day he'd become awash with guilt and sadness. His small studio never seemed bigger than after her death. Now, he stares into the mens' bathroom mirror, pausing for only a moment before spraying it with Windex glass cleaner. Not two days later, Jorge would use the same bottle to wash Josh's dried blood from the floor tiles where he had taken his own life."
5,WOW!! THESE ARE GOOD GAMES!,"A long time ago I bought X-Wing (the original, not the collecters version) and considering I was only 7(or less, I can't remember exactly) it was too challenging for me but I found it was still very fun. A little afterward I bought Tie Fighter (again not collecters), I found this to be a little easier then X-Wing but still just as fun. I've seen the collecters versions for both and they have signifigantly improved in many areas, not the least of which is graphics. I still play Tie Fighter and would also still play X-Wing if it weren't for the fact that I hard installed it on my old computer(which I no longer own) that we dont have anymore and I no longer have the disk. Overall I have to say that they both are amazing games. I've never played the third game but even if it's really bad, paired with the two other games...... I have to say it's definatly worth it to buy this product."
4,An old favorite returns,"X-Wing was a truly fun and challenging game when it first came out, and now its even better. Upgraded graphics make the game more realistic and the movie soundtracks are a great improvement over the synthetic soundtrack of old. This is definitely one of the best pilot games of all time.My only complaint is the lack of realistic situations in some scenarios. As you proceed, you will find yourself piloting a lone ship assigned to take on a virtual armada of enemy ships. If any commander routinely sent his pilots into such ridiculous situations, he'd soon find his pilots defecting en masse.The saving grace is the number of non-storyline missions available. When you find yourself defeated for the 20th time on a certain level (and you will) it's nice to have these non-storyline missions available. Another saving grace is that when your character gets killed, you can resurrect him/her and pick up where you left off."
4,A bloody giallo from Bava,"I got a copy of this ""Raro Video"" release from Exploited Cinema. This release is very likely an uncut version compared with the US releases. Note that the audio comes in original Italian with English subtitles, which I consider much better than a usually poor English dubbing. Extras include a documentary with enterviews to people that talk about the cinema of director Mario Bava. Contrary to some, the only commonality between Bay of Blood (actually a more precise translation from the Italian title would be ""chain reaction"") and the subsequent Tuesday the 13th, is a scene in which a loving couple that is stubbed to death with a spur. The main motive here has to do with several people killing each other to inherit a property surrounded by a bay. Overall, a must have for Bava fans."
3,A handy book - especially if you are new to computers,"This is a great book for people who have no idea how to use a computer. It can be a bit too simplictic at times, which is great for ""dummies."" Its chapter on extensions is a nice inclusion, letting you know which can go and which must remain... giving you the ability to free up precious memory. It also has a nice listing of helpful and informative Mac related web-sites in the back.This book quickly and concisely fills you in on all the basics you need to know to be efficient and productive with MacOS 9 or any MacOS really. But if you are looking for something more thorough, you may want to check out something like MacOS 9: The Missing Manual."
1,Disappointing,"Flimsy construction...potentially dangerously so. One could easily get cut with this device. Also wears out very quickly. While it does sharpen knives that already have a good edge, the negatives far outweigh the positives. Rachel Ray backed the wrong horse. I keep one around for finishing work on a particular knife, but I am always concerned about safety."
2,Worn out fast,"Just to confirm the other reviews, I used it on 2 sets of knives, so maybe 10 total, yes pretty dull, but this item is done. the diamond dust areas are very worn, and no longer sharpen, I didn't expect a lot for $20, so I give it 2 stars."
2,not what it's sliced up to be,"I know that others rate this highly, but so far, i've not been able to get a sharp edge on a high-quality chef's knife, nothing compared to what i get with a stone followed by a steel. i'm glad i didn't spend a lot of money on this... i think it's a gimmick."
2,Worst Sharpener Ever,This sharpener scratched up a very nice chefs knife of mine and left the blade duller than when I started. Save your money and buy a Smith's or Chef's Choice.
3,Not so much,A lot less than expected .................................. ..... ... .. . . . . . . . . . . .
1,USELESS,This produt couldnt be worse its makes a horrible screeching noise when you go to use it and it makes your knife even duller than it was before you used it i had bought a 5 dollar kitchen knife sharpener from walmart that worked a hell of alot better than this piece of junk
2,Badproduct,"Plastic junk that does not sharpen that well, a real waste of money, especially to have her name on it ,never again will I use it and I have only had it a day."
1,Hate to say it...,Rarely write reviews... Really had high hopes for this product but my final consensus is that this thing is cheap junk... You would be better of sharpening your knives with a sham wow...
1,80 grit sand paper would be better than this piece of crap,"got it today, I bough it because it seemed like a good tool to keep the kitchen knifes in good shape.It sounds as if you are scraping nails on a chalkboard wiht every swipe, and it will not sharpen your knife. Glad I didn't try it on my bench made but just a simple kitchen knife.please just take your 19 bucks and set them on fire, it will bring you more fulfilment."
4,Sharp Knifes are less dangerous and more productive.,We purchased this sharpener along with the Rachel Ray knife and we highly recommend this handy sharpening device. It is easy to take out of the kitchen drawer - use - and quickly fold up and store. One of the best knife sharpeners we've ever used.
2,A bit disappointed...,"I chose this particular sharpener partially based on the fact that it is labeled as a Furi product. I don't think that it was manufactured by Furi - their products are generally pretty good quality.The first time that I used it, I broke one of the side latches off. Not a big deal, but not a good sign. The results that I'm getting are a bit mixed. Some knives come to life, some don't. (My test is the ease with which a knife will slice a ripe tomato.)After reading some of the less favorable reviews, it seems like I'm dealing with two things.1. The position of the knife as you draw it through is important. It's not as foolproof as it is advertised to be.2. I'm probably not going to be happy with the longevity of the product. Apparently, the diamond surface wears pretty quickly.I would NOT be able to recommend this item for purchase and will continue to look for a better alternative."
2,Not impressed,"I bought this, after trying several other sharpening products. None worked particularly well. This included. It does a barely adequate job of sharpening, inconsistantly and with minor blade scratching. Not a fan."
1,Great...then gone fast!,"Upon receiving this product, I immediately and easily sharpened all My Henckel knives and old Chicago Cuttlery knives. The process was quick and easy and the edge it produced seemed quite good.However, after that first session, the device seemed to be not working as well as at first. Repeated trips through the sharpener did nothing and possibly appeared to be dulling my knives instead. Close inspection revealed that the diamond dust was gone in critical areas.What a disappointing performance for something that has received such rave reviews from so many ...and has not lasted beyond that first encounter.Now I am in search of another sharpener, possibly the AccuSharp as highly rated by Cooks.AccuSharp 001 Knife Sharpener"
3,A little disappointing,"Will sharpen a blade if you maintain proper alignment and downward pressure in the device's fingers. This is easier said than done, particularly with smaller knives."
1,Cheap,"I guess I should have been more skeptical, but with all of the good reviews I went for it. I can't remember if it was the first swipe or the second, but I cut the diamond dust clean off of one of the fingers. I figured it was bad luck, and I still had 7 others to do the job. By the second knife I had pealed away the textured part of the fingers away from at least three of the 8 fingers. It took 10 seconds or more to align each swipe so that I didn't rip the entire thing apart. Don't waste your time."
2,"Wear out too quick, Not worth the price","Diamond fingers wore out very quickly within a couple of months. The quality is very disappointing. Now almost all of diamond stuff is gone from the point whre most needed, and now it actually make my knif dull. Also my wife was able to tear off puny plastic cover on the side when she tried to open it on the first day.I don't like the fact that Rachael Ray is cashing in, eighther. If you'd like a sharpener which will only last a few months of use, and would like to contribute Rachael's ever-growing account, buy this. I would like my money back from Rachael Ray. Good idea, poor quality."
4,Perfect size,"At first I was disappointed with how small it was, but soon realized it's a wonderful space saver. Our knives have been sharpened multiple times with this now and we simply adore it. May have to get another one eventually as the dust wares down, but it's worth the price!"
1,"Dont order from these people !!!!!!! "" As Seen On TV""","I ordered this product but never received it. Several emails to them, they promised they would reship it.Never Got anything!!!! Finally had to request my money back."
4,"hard to open, easy to use","a good product for the price, but it takes a bit of practice to open it smoothly. Once it's ready to go, the product works quite well."
2,Unremarkable,"I used this on several good knives and was not impressed by its performance. In all fairness though, I have yet to find a good knife sharpener for home use that is not terribly expensive. Off to the hardware store again...."
3,Don't Buy this version of the Iron Lung EP!!!!!,"Yes, this version is several dollars cheaper than the other, but you should definately check out the other one if you really liked the bends or OK Computer. If you do purchase this one, just know that you missed out on Trickster(one of my favorite radiohead songs ever),Punchdrunk Lovesick Singalong(another of their best B-sides), the just so-so Lozenge of Love, and,last but not least, an acoustic version of creep with just Thom on guitar that is even more plaintive and self-loathing than the original. Damn tasty!"
4,Fit 21' Bay Boat Perfect,"Good quality, fit perfect and kept drinks cold for 2 solid days. The seat does have a little ""play"" as it sits on the mount sides, the wobble might scare you until you get used to it, but it's by no means a defect. Good product, would buy again."
3,Consumer Alert,"This appears to be a duplicate listing. The same cd appears to be available for a few bucks elsewhere... if there is any difference, the seller should provide details."
2,ESQ By Movado Mens Watch,"I brought this watch for my husband for Christmas 2010. The watch is beautiful. However now it's April 29, 2011. I have no way of contacting Amazon, as they have removed the link to let them know that the band on the watch has completely falling apart. My husband does not wear this watch everyday as he changes watches along with attire daily. It is somewhat embassing to give bragging rights to Movado and be disappointed like this. I can purchase a new watch band however it's the principal. ""ESQ by Movado"" brand name expectations should last longer than a mere 5 months."
1,Battery replacement,"I bought a similar ESQ watch (no longer available from Amazon), but my issue is likely relevant to all ESQ watches. Movado makes it nearly impossible to change the battery yourself with these; I wasn't able to get the back off even with a special tool I bought for the task. Not a problem if you don't mind driving to and paying for a jeweler (Movado wants you to take it to one of their service affiliates) every time the battery needs replacement. I do. Changing the battery should be a simple task; but Movado evidently sees it as another revenue source. Their excuse is that some 24-step process or so is needed because of the water resistance feature, but I've replaced batteries easier on watches with better water resistance ratings than the ESQ. Just say no to Movado."
2,Very disappointing,"Lisbeth Scott sings on two songs on the album 'Earthbound' by Paul Schwartz, both of which are so good they give me goose-bumps. So, I was inspired to buy this album.I was extremely disappointed to find it completely mediocre, with not a single song that even held my attention, let alone my interest. Clearly, my taste differs from that of the other people who have reviewed this album, but that's my opinion."
3,Decent,"This cd has some good tracks, but many of it is of unkown artist who, are really display some good tallent. There are many great tracks, so overalll it is a decent cd."
3,Marginally good SM book,"While there were several sections of the book that were quite good (such as Transgenderism, descriptions of Dominants/submissives, Bondage, and a good resources section), there were several chapters that seemed to cover the same topics that other books for SM novices have already covered. While these are important topics to cover, it seems the author made these topics a bit too simplistic. In the first half of the book, I found my mind wandering often.The second half of the book (where most of the above information is located) was better. However, Gloria's mention of ""Old Guard"" practices is slightly off. There never was one true Old Guard (possibly variations on it), and she makes it seem as if there was.I also noticed in the Resource section that no mention is made of the book SM101 by Jay Wiseman, which IMO is also an excellent introductory SM book."
2,Only for beginners,"This is a truly mediocre book, form someone who ought to be able to do better. Ms Brame has been active in the SM scene for years; she ought to have rid herself of the stereotypes years ago, especially since this is so clearly a book intended for people so new to the scene that they don't even know if they are dominant or submissive. And Ms Brame ought to be able to help them with that without resorting to silly, ""Cosmo"" style quizzes that really only provide limited amusement and less real information. The amount of cutesy tripe that puffs up this book is especially annoying because there are some sections that have the potential to be of great help to the newcomer, but can barely be found, buried, as they are, under trite in-jokes. Perhaps Ms Brame figured that actually providing information wasn't so important, as her readers had probably already read the other, really good books that have been introducing newcomers to the scene for many years."
4,Intended audience -- do you fall into that category?,"Brame's ""Come Hither"" is really for those who are looking to either spice up their love life or those who are turned off by the average BDSM books and organizations. However, Brame does suggest that you getinvolved and do more reading -- an excellent piece of advice since the bibliography and recommended books she lists leave a good deal out and ""common sense"" is rarely a great guide to life, especially sex. In 13 chapters she does a good job of looking at several issues and behaviors that one may want to try that fall into the BDSM umbrella. As I find frustrately common in non-fiction sexuality books, there is a lack of correct citations."
1,Rinky Dink,"I ordered this product and in the description it stated that it was compatable with my battery but it was not. I never used it and never returned it. To me it reminded me of the reproduced homemade movies, where the outside CD cover lookes like it is printed from a home computer, that's how the box looked... Next time I'm going to my local store."
3,"Nothing new, but the basics are always helpful.","Don't pay a lot for this one. If it appeared as an article in a magazine, you'd say it was helpful. As a book, it loses some value."
3,Frustrated,I am a beginner in Astrology and was very interested in the topic but am dissappointed that you need several other books to create your chart. The format of the book also does not lend itself to photocopying the charts in the book as you work your way thru the chapters. I would recommend to the author that he add a link to a web site where the reader could print the templates for completing the charts for each chapter. Examples in the book of how to actually read the sources cited would also have been helpful.
5,best green tea ever,"Well, if anyone can find a better green tea you should let me know. I have never been fond of green tea due to the bitterness - until now. Ineeka creates teas of such quality. I am impressed with the smooth flavor and lack of bitterness and, finally have a green tea that I can enjoy every day. FYI - Their Himalayan Black is my all time favorite tea."
5,Best Green Tea!,"A little expensive, but extremely good. I can tell a big difference from cheaper teas, such as Tazo-brand green teas. I drink it on special occasions, maybe twice a week. Very mild, non-bitter flavor and aroma. I find this to be one of my favorites. There is a lot of waste in throwing out the aluminum container the tea comes in, please recycle!"
1,disappointed,"i lived in japan for four years and have tasted wonderful green tea, but this is not one of them. i found the taste watery and stale, and the tin is wasteful--the top part being hollow (to make it look bigger?) i also found the tea bag style more gimmicky than useful. ""Choice"" green teas or others similar are easier to use and brew up a much better tea (course, loose, fresh tea is always superior to bagged tea)."
2,"It is ok, not bad and not that good","Some people like the tea bag, but I don't. My tea cup is not big, and I won't throw the tea bag away after just one fill. I would like to refill my cup because there are still much content left in the tea bag. But it was not convenient to do so because of the design of the tea bag.Since I did not want to throw it away after the first fill, while I was dringking the tea, I had to either find a place to put it or I had to let it just sit on the edge of my tea cup. By the former way, it was not very convenient; while by the latter way, it was not easy for the mouth to find space to drink.Anyway, I must say I like the traditional tea bag.The taste of the tea was not bad and was not much better than the others.The only thing I like is the container.To conclude, I won't buy the tea again."
4,A great trip down music memory lane,"This is John's first publication and what a great insight into the rockin', r'n'b days of the early sixties and beyond. John has played with many iconic music figures and his list of buddies and playing partners is quite phenominal. The book charters his path through playing from teenage years around the clubs of Southend-on-Sea to recording for major labels with The Fingers and Legend to name but two. A good read for those who know John and for those who have followed his career and the bands in which he's performed. Looking forward to another!"
1,This software was written for Windows95,"When I saw the price was nearly $60, I didn't even think to check for what operating system this game was designed. It was designed for Windows95. That's right pre-Y2K operating system. Unless you have a desktop running Windows95, I don't recommend this game."
3,Chemistry Approach to Group Theory,"This is a decent book if your an organic chemist who wants to understand the fundamentals of group theory. It is inexpensive and short, so it a great read for someone who is looking to do some self studying."
2,Boring!,The idea of this game is very cute but the execution is terrible. I have been working on it with my 7 year old daughter and we have been at the rabbit stage for a long time now. It is very repetitious and it starts to feel like a real job.
2,Horrible,I Don't Like this game. It was twelve dollars and i had to trade it for another game. DONT GET THE GAME! It is confusing and hard to play.
5,Excellent Reference,The expedition that Prince Maximilian and Karl Bodmer took through America is one of the best kept secrets in American History. This text provides an excellent view of what North America looked like to individuals traveling through the area for the first time. The combination of Bodmer's glorious aquatints with Maximilian's educated notes create a combination that any early American Historian or early Western fan should study if they truly love the subject.
2,Obsolete,"This book was written in the '80s was copy written in 1990.It has a folksy tone and some technical information.Unless you are buying your church's sound system at a second hand store, this book is going to leave you wondering what might be available today. For example: ""CD recorders are under development""."
5,"Review on ""Sound Systems for Worship.""","I scanned this book after buying it. I definetely plan on reading this. It is a very useful book. True, it has a lot of information that goes over my head because I've never had classes in communications electronics, for one thing. But it looks very useful for my music career in the near future."
5,"A definite ""must read""","This book isn't just for the church 'soundman'...it's for everyone involved in worship. It covers the basics of ""do we need a sound system"" and how much to spend to setting up the gain structure of your system. It is written in easy to understand terms and has plenty of diagrams. I have been doing sound for over a year for the college-aged 'praise team' and just recently started mixing the sunday morning services. I had picked up a lot of knowledge during that time. This book affirmed some of my ""I think so""s and taught me new things like proper mic placement, monitor mixes, and setting gain structure.This book also goes into the non-technical side of planning the system from building design to what to look for if your going to be highering a sound engineering consultant to build you a system.Its a very good book for the non-audio professionals in a church that volunteer their time to do the church sound."
4,"My First Cookbook, in 1971","My father, who is now 93 and was an excellent cook in his day, gave me a hard bound edition of Marion Browns Southern Cookbook in 1971 while I was in college in Stateboro, GA. It was my first cookbook, and I have used it extensively during the past 38 years. While the new version is ok, I'll stick with my classic edition."
4,Meh,"i've seen some bashings of this book, and that's what made me hesitate about buying it. i did get a scanned version of it, read it and i must say: it is a remarkable comic book. it did exagerate facts in kurt's life, yes, but it isn't supposed to be accurate, it's not a bio, it's a comic. i did love it. excellent graphic work and, well, the way it was written is preety good too. the writer has done some research before actually putting anything down on paper. if you are a comic book fan, kurt cobain fan and understand the difference between a comic and a biography, get this book. if not, better just leave it alone."
1,Kurt is rolling in his grave...,"Wow. Never before have I seen such a ham-fisted, inept and downright exploitive depiction of one man's life - in ANY medium. It would almost make me angry, if the results weren't so unintentionally hysterical.The writing is absolutely atrocious. It feels like some bad ""made-for-TV"" movie. The art is so unbelievably over-the-top, it feels like self-parody. How could anyone draw (let alone read) this thing with a straight face?Sadly, this book only succeeds in making a joke out of someone's life...and given all the recent Cobain cash-ins, that's saying an awful lot."
4,in responce to the responce,"Like in the last responce, that first letter is fake. i wanted to make sure they both werent fake. but any way kurts name was 'kurt D. Cobain' that no siblings of his had the same initials. but anyway the book is good. it is just a comic so dont listen to these other people i liked it and im a VERY big kurt cobain fan. this did not seem like it offended kurt cobain, it just exagerated the truth...alot"
4,I love it and I hate it,"If you like comic books because of the drawings, and you like Kurt you should get this book, since the drawings are awsome. That's why I love it.Now the point where I hate the book: it is SOOOOO positive about Courtney Love it makes me sick. The drawer, flameboy, even asks at the end of the book ""if she is satisfied with the way he drawed her"". Can you imagine?But for the art, definitly get this book, NOT for the story.I heard somewhere that the one who drew it killed himself, flameboy, I don't know if thats true or anything..."
3,Good graphics - but mainly a fairy tale,"The graphics in this book are excellently done, while the prose in the introduction is well-written, and in some cases hits the nail right on the head (such as when they speak of Cobain's genius, legend, etc.), but I disagree with the assertions made, especially that Cobain suffered from 'mental illness'. There are several comments that are pure speculation, as are several parts of the book itself. I also see a great similarity to the storyline of Godspeed to that of the Cross book Heavier Than Heaven, which in many minds, mine included, is a heavily fictionalized account of Cobain's life and death. While one might want to add this well-drawn to their collection, they should view it more as art-fiction, than anything resembling reality."
5,Nice Product,The board arrived in good condition. The packaging arrived in good condition and the board was not damaged. The board is better looking than I expected for the price. It went up easy we are happy with how it looks. It erases easily and completely unlike several boards I have had in the past from other manufacturers.
5,My VB Controls Bible,"This book is absolutely first rate. Don't bother fooling with VB Help when you want to know something about a control; it's all in Dictor's really exceptional book. Unlike dear old Microsoft, right-to-the-point info on any control is very easy to find. The book is accurate, thorough, and has very few misprints. Its excellent, brief examples illuminate the real-world use of the controls. It's head and shoulders above anything available elsewhere at any price. I own 20 VB books, but this is one of the two or three I use all the time. It's great for learning or for reference..."
1,Only received one volume of TWO,"Two volumes were advertised and shown in the photo and description. I received only 1 volume (Volume 2). Either a mistake was made when the item was packed and both volumes were not included, or the item was misrepresented. I want Volume 1 to be sent ASAP."
4,Exciting history of the Cambodian church!,"While this book does provide a historical account of the formation and growth of the Cambodian evangelical church, I enjoyed it more for the exciting tales of what the Lord accomplished in the lives of these wholly committed believers.Their stories fill you with sorrow over the horrors they had to face in return for their faith, but they also fill you with awe at the amazing grace and deliverance shown to many of these saints as they served their Lord so faithfully.I highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in the history of the Pol Pot era in Cambodia and especially to believers who are wish to be inspired by those who have been tested and found faithful."
5,Great portrayal of God at work,"A very vivid & inspiring account of missionaries at work in Cambodia! For someone like myself who doesn't know much about missionary work, especially in third world countries & during war time, it's a real eye & spirit opener! This book lets me witness God's abundant grace through many great Christians, bringing me tears on few occasions. I have a deeper understanding of what it means to be humble, to love, to have faith, & to commit as a Christian."
3,Decent but Mostly a Repeat of Riley's Books,This is an OK DVD but I didn't find much in it that wasn't already covered in John Riley's other books. It was helpful to see Riley play some of the material however.
2,A real snooze of a video,"It's obvious that Mr. Riley is a very good drummer, if you like frenetic, mindless jazz drumming, however his teaching skills leave much to be desired. This is quite possibly the strangest and dryest instructional video I've ever had the misfortune to view let alone waste money on. His monotone and humanless delivery started to really creep me out after about 15 minutes. It's like a drum lesson from a zombie, or a weird android. I'm certain for the amount of money I paid for this video I could have had a lesson with a human being and gotten just as much or more for my money. If you really want to purchase an instructional video I would suggest Steve Smith's DVD, Joe Morello's, or Jo Jo Myer's vid. In addition to all of that this DVD is clearly meant for Jazz drummers. If you're not interested in Jazz drumming then this video is probably not for you."
2,broken in shipment,"As with other comments on this product, they arrived completely broken. Couldn't say if they were any good intact."
1,Would give it ZERO points if possible,"The ugliest glasses you would ever come across. The product quality is also very bad. They look cheap. I had to throw away mine and get new one from Bed bath.Oh did I mention that one of the glass was broken when it reached me (bad packaging) but since these things are so bulky, I didn't even bother to return it."
4,book good - delivery took too long,In this case the delivery really took very long and it was not possible to track my order the whole time either. But besides that everything just went fine.
1,BE CAREFUL !!!,"Hello !!I supposedly found here a Vocal Score from the opera The Rape of Lucretia by B. Britten for $25 dlls aprox, I thought it was a great deal because usually it costs more than 100 dlls, so I bought it, the problem was that when I got the package there was not a vocal score in there, instead of that I got a small book that is just the Libretto of the Opera The Rape of Lucretia by Ronald Duncan, so folks, be careful with ordering this item, check very well if it is really what you need.I got very surprised, because this is not the first time that I buy sheet music through Amazon.Anyway, just keep it in mind."
4,Just as expected,"It's great that old anime such as Outlaw Star is getting released out on DVD in full box sets rather than just the volumes. I have to admit I was a bit worried about this. I've read about burned box sets being sold and I thought maybe this was one but it was everything I expected and more. It includes every episode of outlaw star, and great quality. The time it took to deliver was fast as can be even during the holiday season much to my surprise. This is definitely a must have for anyone who enjoyed watching this anime."
4,Make Sure You Shop Around,"Amazon was one of the better prices for this when they were taking preorders. Now they are the highest that I've found. Try Circuit City, Best Buy or Robert's Anime corner."
4,Almost three stars instead of four.,"I remember first watching this on cartoon network and I thought it was amazing. However; after watching it two more times after purchasing it, I was far less impressed. I have to say that the shows story is compelling, but the way that it is carried out leaves much to be desired. Also, there is not a time in this show where I didnt feel like I was watching a generic version of Cowboy Bebop with aspects of Tenchi Muyo thrown in. I would recommend this to anyone just getting started with anime; or anyone looking to expand their anime collection. Again, not an amazing anime, but it definitely is worth seeing at least once."
5,Future Hero Next Generation,"Between the captivating storyline, top-notch 90's animation, and in-depth character relationships, I would definitely place Outlaw Star among the most watch-worthy of anime, or even of all telivision series of the science fiction genre. The mixture of mysterious relics, tau martial artists, and futuristic technologically advanced setting of space makes for quite and interesting plot, and into it is thrown a motley crew of identifyable rejects. Also, of the the few notable japanese english translations that does not leave true fans in tears. Lavish characters, awesome action sequences, and an admirable struggle betwixt powers in space. Truly one the the greatest peices in existance. I say ""full sub-ether ahead!"" Get prepared for an all-time classic of sci-fi anime."
5,yay!,"good 'ol classic anime I've been dying to get, wanted to get this ever since I was a kid. I'm older now and I still love it."
5,outlaw star :complete collection,"it came in a timely manner, was exactly as advertised, and I'm overall very satisfied with my purchase and look forward to buying more products from this seller."
4,awesome,"All the discs work great. There is a little cosmetic damage on the edge of the box, but that was in the description. This anime rocks. Do yourself a favor, and get it."
1,"Wonderful show, awful DVDs","Huge fan of the show, and it's so sad to see corrupted disks and episodes that are artifacted and difficult to watch. Again, love the show, just hate the build quality of these DVDs."
5,A good Anime Series,"I was a huge fan of this anime when I seen it on the Cartoon network. This series is cut in to 26, 30 min episodes And the Box set I got say ""All 26 Episodes on 3 DVD's"" it is true but then again it is not true. There is a total of 6 disks Labled DVD 1-3/ Disk 1-2 Each ""DVD"" Has 2 disks. I laughed at this.Now the Series its self is Sci-fi Action Anime and it hits home on those points.Its got a Good story, lots of Space Action its a great series.If your a fan of Sci-fi Anime Pick this up.If your a fan of Action Anime Pick this up."
3,Almost well-done,"Jeff Long could have ascended to great author status with this intelligent, well-designed story of a subterranean world that incorporates all of our worst fears of Hell. He didn't, however, because of a lack of attention to details. Not only our heroes, but all characters in the book seem to be the ideal manifestations of the dreams of a liberal baby-boomer. From our Himalayan mountain climber guide (is this Jeff Long's idea of himself?) to the well-spoken, dignified congresswoman; through the military types that never seem to know anything, to the anti-Catholic sentiment that lines the entire story; it is obvious that there is a great book here if one can just make it through all of the rhetoric. Additionally, most of the names of the characters portray obvious stereotypes. Mustafah, Ali, Santos, and just about every member of the scholarly Beowulf Circle illustrate this point. In short, Jeff Long simply doesn't do himself justice as a writer by short-changing a great plot."
3,The first three chapters are great,I loved the first three chapters but then something happened and the story fell into it's own version of The Descent. It is a worthwhile read but disappointed me after such a wonderful start
5,A Must Read,"After reading about a quarter of this novel in 1 sitting I felt compelled to place my thoughts here as well. This book more than any I've picked up this year had me hooked from page 1 and only gets better the further you travel. I agree with the other comments:Great characters, great story, spooky as hell. Something for every fan of adventure, mystery and action. This is exactly the type of novel that could quickly become a bestseller and I couldn't be happier for Mr.Long. I'm looking forward to delving into his other works as soon as possible."
4,Great start,"However, the finish was weak and the story fell apart. It is still a good bedtime read that I would recommend."
4,A Must Read,"What a great book. I haven't been scared by a book in a long time, but this one did it. The first five chapters hook you in. I started reading it late one night and got halfway through before I had to close my eyes to sleep. I had a fitful sleep that night, and woke up in a cold sweat--what a scary book! Jeff Long portrays a vivid world, where the hadals occasionally come above ground for their sacrifices and food. I could totally picture the underworld. I told my family how scared I was reading the book, and they laughed at me, but when they actually read it...they got scared too! I highly recommend this book if you're into horror/sci-fi/apocolyptic tales."
5,darkness and light,"I came to this book via Long's latest novel, Year Zero, which has nothing to do with The Descent...but maybe everything. Year Zero starts (and ends) with a manhunt for the historical Jesus, and now I see, to my delight, that The Descent is about a manhunt for the historical Satan. Talk about epic journeys, and smart, too. Between heaven and hell on earth, where will Long go from here? I can't wait for his next one."
5,Absolute page turner!,Completely hooked from page one. Recommend that this book be read in a dark room with a flashlight!
5,Awesome! One of the best-written books I've ever read.,"As an avid reader, I typically read several books at a time, and several a week. This novel has it all -- sex, gore, romance, piracy, mercenaries, world leaders, hellfire and brimstone, God, Satan, and adventure like Jules Verne never dreamed of. As good as the best of Grisham. This author has an imagination, knowledge, and depth that one seldom encounters."
3,Starts off great...but I quit halfway through.,"At first, I was stunned w/ the imagery in this book. The being found in the cave...what Branch sees when his chopper goes down....I thought it was going to be a great story. But, as I feared, it became too wordy, too much military and religious blah blah blah-ing. Not enough of what caught my attention to begin with. Half way through the book, I gave up. I went to the last 2 chapters to see how it ends. I don't feel like I missed anything by doing so, and don't even feel guilty for doing it like I normally would! Recommended for the premise, but not recommended for the overly-long drawn out presentation."
3,Full of inaccuracies,"The author, who utilizes the US Armed Forces as a both a backdrop and a prime mover in his novel, has done little to no research in that area, and it shows. If the reader can pardon his mistakes, it is a fair adventure yarn. Better choices are available."
1,Started well but I was soon bored,The book started nicely but I was bored about 1/2 way through the book. I was ready to be done with this book but forced myself to finish it by skimming/reading. Too much time in the caves wandering around. Not enough focus on character development and building a gripping plot.
5,one of the most underrated books available!,"The Descent is a lot of things - action adventure, horror, theological discussion - but in the end it is essentially just a rip-roaring epicthat is not easily forgotten. The characters are multidimensional and complicated and I found myself willing to follow them in any narrative, not just this one. But what an incredible journey they guide us through! To go into too much detail would be robbing the reader of the pleasure of discovery that comes with all great books. Suffice it to say that Jeff Long is a true writer, one who cares about the turn of a phrase, the poetry found in the language of classic adventure novels by Verne, Wells and Conan Doyle. The Descent is just one of his great works, but a perfect place to start.P.D. HoganAuthor ofBelieve (The Weeping Tree Chronicles)"
5,I loved it!,"Wow! This book completely took me by surprise! I really loved it. And while it did get off to a bit of slow start, once it finally did start moving, it became impossible to put down. Unfortunately, the first 115 pages only covered the action described in the synopsis on the back cover, but that's really my only complaint about the entire book. It was well-written, and definitely well-executed. Long's spin on the true nature (and location) of Hell felt fresh and original. The book carried surprises throughout and all in all, it was really great. I'm definitely going to be tracking down his other books!"
2,Hard to Finish,I really looked forward to reading this book and was disappointed.What to say about this book? How about it sat next to my bedside every night for 6 nights and every night it got HARDER and HARDER to pick it up. This author says in 10 words what anyone else could say in 1 word. This book DRONNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNED on and on.I finally cheated and started skipping sentences and then paragraphs. It was like watching a soap opera. You can tune in days from now and it is the SAME thing. I gave up tonight and just read the last 10 pages to GET THIS BOOK OVER WITH. It goes back to the library today.The idea of the book is original -under the Earth demons - so for originality I gave the author 2 stars. I just hope another more talented author picks up the idea and runs with a better plot.
2,"Strong start, then fizzled","The book started off with a very creepy, scary opening scene in the Himalayans, and I was very impressed, and hooked. But then numerous other unrelated characters are introduced, and several years are skipped over. The plot is very messy and convoluted, it's just all over the place. Random ""Incidents"" appear in the book to further kill the narrative momentum. I tried to stick with it, but it became such a chore that Igave up about halfway through."
4,"Alternate ""The Descent""","I enjoyed this book because it created a new world of great excitement and horrible terror.But, I wish that Jeff Long had given the Hadals a more advanced civilization, which could have challenged Human notions of supremacy and create a new competitor for the energy resources of the Earth.Also,this ""clash of civilizations"" could force people to reevaluate our principles to strenghen our resolve and the Hadals would be forced to deal with human society as a real presense,not a boogeyman to scare their children."
4,Hang on for the ride,"From the moment the characters find a body with mysterious tattoos... To when one by one they disappear... To when they find out what is below the surface of the earth... You will be totally engrossed. This book was awesome. The concept was well thought out & you get pulled into the story. It is a very long book & sometimes I felt a little lost, but it was well worth the effort. Highly recommended."
4,WOW!,"I ordered this book from my book club with some skepticism. I only wanted a new book to read and this one sounded OK. Was I suprised when I started reading it! The very begining is very intense! It has lots of twists and turns. I couldn't put it down most of the time. I've never read anything form Jeff Long, but, man, is he descriptive! I felt like I was right there with the people in the book. I could picture everything like I had watched it in a movie! I would've given it 5 stars, but I didn't find the ending very good...it was so abrupt! But all in all I'd still read it because the story itself was awesome! And u never know, maybe he'll write a sequel to make up for the ending."
4,The descent into a long night,"I liked it. Kept me reading into the wee hours. Jeff, write more stuff!"
5,Descent into Greatness,"Long's ""The Descent"" is one of the best thrillers I've read - not a thriller per se, but just plain thrilling. Spelunking, mountain climbing, and science all collide as Long explores long-held myths about the underworld and what it contains. Not to be missed - especially if you like butterfly-related tragedies."
5,OUTSTANDING!!! 5 STARS,This is a great work of horror/scifi. This is the book that Stephen King wishes he could write. I couldn't put it down and didn't want it to end. EXCELLENT!!!
5,Totally fulfilling read,Long has succeeded in taking a feasible concept and entwining it with diverse characters to produce a knockout story. His use if personalities and forces of good and evil are spellbinding. A truly remarkable display of talent and delivery.
5,I want a digital copy,WHY CAN'T I BUY THIS DIGITALLY?????? LESLIE STONE. (ITS ONE OF MY FAVORITES) I was planning on giving a gift of this story....so diappointing
5,Couldn't put this down!,"This book is a little out of my typical genre, but I could not put it down. It was recommended by a book forum and I was glad I took their advice. I read the book within 3 days because it was so enthralling. You really begin to feel for each of the characters and get to know them deeply. The horror is not a particular gory type and mostly builds through great suspense throughout the story. There wasn't much room to breath or any boring areas of this awesome novel."
5,An explanation of evil,"This novel is well written and has a plausible plot if you accept the premise of an underworld. I don't understand how an author writes these stories, because just reading them disturbs me. I have to go back to positive religious readings or positive patriotic themes to get my mind corrected. With that said, this story is very good, and almost requires a repeat read to assimilate all the nuances. I'll move on, however."
4,Jules Verne meets Stephen King,"Great concept with little moralization when you consider 'The Devil' becomes a more and more central character as the the book climaxes. A very fast start to the book, and it only slows down in the last five chapters before picking back up for a dramatic ending which like a great movie leaves openings for a sequel. Well rounded treatment of all characters, including the Hadals, and a worldly scope that goes beyond our surface earth including geopolitics. Obvious detail was given to the medical and historical detail. Two chapters (Where a Butterfly catcher and Midwest boy are the central focus) seem thrown in out of the blue and somewhat needless, but other then that and a few minor quibbles where I think the book could have expanded on ideas it was a solid and enjoyable read. Worth the time."
5,A great read!,"I loved this book. Please write more Mr. Long! A very intriguing concept and a suspenseful storyline make this book a real page turner. I usually pride myself in figuring out the ending of a story, but this ending was a complete surprise. I'm hoping for a sequel."
2,Great Idea; Poorly Written Book,"I was drawn in by a well-written first chapter and the promise of info about these new underground creatures i.e., religion, family structure, etc. These were not explored any more than the character of Satan or his city. Character development is missing along with the realities of environmentalist and nationalist groups preventing the exploitation of sub-earth. The premise of this book is exceptional. A better writer would have given us a mixture of Jules Verne exploration and H. Rider Haggard lost race adventure story that might have ranked with their best works. A waste of reading time."
5,"THE BEST BOOK OF THIS GENRE! EPIC, SUSPENSEFUL, FULFILLING!","Jeff Long has taken the time to craft a suspenseful science horror novel that fulfills its promise. A well-honed cosmology forms a fantastic underlayment, which allows the suspense of the story to shine on its own merits. Contrary to what another reviewer has posted, many of the questions ARE answered, albeit subtly, in the course of the narrative.Long poses several hypotheses regarding the nature of the abyss and its inhabitants: 95% of these hypotheses are borne out in the telling. This makes for a terrific read that is both intelligent and fun."
4,Very engaging book,"I rarely read fiction, so it takes a book that is pretty interesting - one that really makes you think - to keep my attention. Some have criticized that this book does not explain certain things and is far fetched in terms of what is physically possible. While I agree that there are some issues there, keep in mind that this is called science fiction for a reason. The key thing here is the concepts and writing style - orignal and excellent respectively. I hope there is a sequel."
5,"Fantastic book. Action packed, fast paced.","If you like a book that combines lost civilizations and exploration DEEP under the earth, along with sociology, theology, a little romance and lots of action, this is it! Best of all, the author details the team's exploration miles deep into the earth so that you feel you are right there experiencing the impenetrable darkness, rushing rivers, and dirt caking your skin. And the flying demon-like creatures that haunt them on their trek under the earth are convincing and well crafted.I hope this autor writes more books like this. Best book I've read in ages and I am a voracious reader of thrillers. Don't miss this book! - N.L"
2,Too scary for me to finish,I bought this book for 50 cents at a garage sale - thought it would be about spelunking - and had it around for a couple of months before I started reading it - it was very good; could barely put it down - but unfortunately after it invaded my dreams for two nights running had to remove it from my premises. Too scary to contemplate - even in fiction.
3,The Descent,"Under the earth's surface, a hidden civilization has existed for millennia. Now, they have come to threaten humanity.Wonderful speculative ideas and some gorgeous images and turns of phrase. The execution seems flawed, though.It's never quite clear why the hadals become a threat at this particular moment in time. The moments when they and their underworld are discovered are told in pure exposition, robbing the narrative of potential drama. The hadals and their culture are the most fascinating part of the book, yet Long chooses to focus on human military weirdos, keeping the hadals mysterious throughout. Having mystery for part of the novel would have been a good way to maintain tension, but I wanted to get to the bottom of things eventually and never did. The novel's conclusion seemed to degenerate into an action movie without really addressing the larger themes.Characters are fairly appealing, and there are some wonderfully grotesque moments."
2,Too bad ...,Great idea about invaders fm below but they just don't invade anything and then get shy after killing hundreds of thousands of soldiers; where is my action ? Too bad because the idea is new ( as far as I know) on that scale and Long can write.
1,over rated,"the book has no depth, weak story line more boring than scary, actually not even on tales from the crypt level"
1,Poorly written and offensive,"There are so many problems with this book. Firstly, gaping plot holes render the story completely illogical and impossible to follow. On top of that, the author uses ridiculously offensive and colonial language, surprising and upsetting for a novel written in 1999. A couple of examples: referring to the subterranean creatures as having ""negroid"" noses and foreheads, as well as ""a peculiar Oriental"" way of communicating. No, I am not making this up. These descriptiors should be found in 19th-century phrenological texts, not novels written and set within the last two decades. Do not read this book, it is a waste of time and money."
2,drops like a lead balloon,"strong opening. smart premise. too ambitious for this author's craft. begins to founder after p. 100. some intriguing moments, a few strong characters, but poor execution, and just doesn't rise above evelyn wood speed reading standards. if you have time to kill, okay; otherwise, steer clear."
3,Unsatisfying!,"Bold premises, ambitious construction, glittering facade....alas, the building had never been treated for termites. With such an ambiguous ending, the book was simply dashed down to ignobility. Mr. Long, you could have done a whole lot better."
3,"Excellent plot concept, but not enough development","This book is so promising in its plot concept, but the author's failure to really develop the characters or delve into greater detail about the underworld makes the book frustrating. This is one of the few novels that could actually use a couple hundred extra pages. The book really barrels through the plot, almost like it was written to be made into a movie. In a way, its a complement to the author that his idea is exciting enough to make readers simply want more book with more detail. Regardless, the author writes well, and I found the book to be an entertaining read."
4,UNDERGROUND TERROR,"Nothing can bring on fears of impending terror more than the absolute darkness of a cave. And to some being underground in a cave can be a living hell. Long has written a great story that takes the reader down into the depths of that living hell and brings him back a changed person. Not since reading Steward's, ""Tales of Dirt, Danger, and Darkness, have I read a story that so vividly describes the terrors one my encounter underground. Buy this book. Read this book. You'll never be the same!"
2,disappointing,"after a great beginning, it tapered off into a ""rush-through"", as if the writer had to meet a deadline and didnt have time to fully develop the characters. a little more longer and deeper, this'd be a classic."
5,Will keep you interested,My husband bought me this as I sat in the hospital preparing for childbirth. i was instantly ensnared! It's a book you'll read more than once. Innovative plot-
5,One Honey of a Book!,"If you like to be engrossed into a book, I would highly recommend this HIGLY enjoyable book. From Page one you will find that you are ""descending"" into the innermost regions of your imagination. Delightful chilling good time!"
4,Beats the heck out of the movie by the same name,"As a climber, caving sounds like a blast. As someone who is claustrophobic...it sounds like something from you know where. In the Descent, the underworld turns out to be just that. To tell anything about the book would give away too much but let's say i can't wait to read the followup to this one which is coming out in hardback."
3,Into the hollow Earth,"This is an interesting read, but it could have been much more. There are simply too many themes and plots. I enjoyed the book, but it is frustrating to leave so much unexplored. The author laid the foundation for about 10 more novels. Maybe he has a sequel or three up his sleeve? I recommend it to horror - fantasy fans because it is a fun book, but it just isn't complete. Mr. Long has a great idea here, and I hope he develops it a bit further. There are a couple more stars in there somewhere."
2,"Starts well, failed to maintain my interest","After the first few chapters I felt that ""The Descent"" was outstanding, however it failed to keep pace and I struggled to complete the book. Too bad, it had great potential."
2,Great Premise - Hellish Writing,"An adventure story about the discovery and exploration of Hell. What a wonderful idea. Unfortunately after a fairly promising first fifty or so pages, the book disintergrated into a boring, badly written, snore-fest that really faltered whenever it left its two main characters. Although it could have been a truely epic tale, as written this book was at least 150 pages too long. More time should have been spent on Homo hadalis and the other neat (but underwritten) subterranean creatures and less time on all the pseudoreligeous garbage. I found many of the characters to be poorly defined, and confusingly similar."
4,Good escape- agree with many other reviews about end,"I saw this book had many good ratings and picked it up.The first 3/4 were quite good IMO.However, the last 1/4 was a let down. There were no in depth explanations of the culture living below the earth.Regardless, it was worth the read to enter this tale."
2,Too slow,"Updated review:Finally managed to finish the book, the story line actually is really good but the delivery is not good. If this were written in the style of Rollins or Child or Preston, I would have finished the book in 2 days instead of 20. Also, it failed to explain how Thomas became who he was, or how ""he"" became Thomas. And isn't ""he"" supposed to be invincible?I read for entertainment (like watching a good action movie), this book is just too slow and going nowhere. I've been struggling to get to the end and am about to give up."
4,Hang on tight for a gripping ride!,"What a satisfying read. I, too, am a voracious reader (3 novels over Labor Day--inc this one), and I'd like to heartily recommend The Descent. Many twists & turns--I love it when I can't figure out where we're going with something. This book is quite original, taking us down roads (literally & figuratively) that we don't ususally go. I'm still sorting through some of the philosophical/religious themes and still processing some rather unusual images (my dreams were a little screwy last night, actually). Definite page turner! It works on so many levels."
4,great book!,"Picked up the book yesterday and just read non-stop until the end. Awesome, very detailed, chock full of plot twists and surprises...I loved the book! I just wish that Jeff Long made it a bit longer to delve into the development of his characters. I was left wanting to know more about them~ I hope there's a sequel planned, for it was an excellent book."
4,Underground Terror,"Not since the book ""Tales of Dirt, Danger, and Darkness"" have I read a book that so vividly describes the terrors lurking underground. Keep the lights on when reading this book! A great read."
5,Great Read....,"PB/Thriller: This book starts with strange events happening all over the world and sucks you in. I world is being taken over from underground or was it already taken over, and we just didn't realize it. Strange humanoid creatures are living underground, way underground. After several years of no contact, we humans decide to visit, inhabit, invade, raid the underground catacombs left. It's a great adventure novel with action and deception."
4,first of this type i have read and loved it,"started this book when i was in japan on buisness, i had barrowed it from a co worker and didnt get a chance to finish. got a kindle for christmas and it was my first purchace. i hate scary movies and didnt think i would enjoy a scary book. I LOVED IT. i wont give anything away but it is worth reading"
4,Pretty good book,"I picked this book up on a whim as I was already buying Year Zero. I've got to say that every time I put this book down, I kept wanting to get back to it so I could finish reading. Very good read, well written."
3,Not quite as good as it could have been,"I really enjoy books like this, that explore the possibility of other worlds and undiscovered races. The first chapter of this book starts off great, and really builds a lot of intrigue. The rest of the book however just seems to fall flat. It keeps building up ideas but it never really explores them in much detail. Jeff Long will introduce one concept about this mysterious race that lives underground, spend a couple of paragraphs on it, then move to something else.Most disappointing was the end of the novel. I couldn't believe it when I had 10 pages left, wondering how in the world the author was going to resolve this story in 10 pages. Well, he did it by a very anti-climatic finish, as I expected.This book had some really good potential with the concept of a new race that lives beneath the Earth, but it's just not explored as well as it could be."
2,"great beginning, ultimately a disappointment","The first three chapters of this book were great and I thought that this book was going to be one of my all time favorites. However, after that, it becomes kind of boring and later still, completely unconvincing. Could've been great, but turned out to be no good."
3,My Love Hate Relationship with The Descent,"I find myself floundering at the beginning of this book and thinking that perhaps I'll just put it down and not finish it. Then, all of a sudden things come together and I can't put the book down.Mr. Long has a wild imagination which is great for one who writes adventure/thriller type books. But I find his style of writing hard to follow at the beginning. Then the light bulb comes on. Unfortunately, the light bulb does not come on until I am a good one third finished with the book.I recommend this book under the proviso that you clear your mind of everything upon starting it. Then, you'll have a hard time not finishing it in one sitting. It is full of adventure which is first rate.If you're looking for a rush, read this book!"
3,Ike was the man...,"Now as for this book, that was a diffrent story. Ike, bless his soul has many, many problems through out this book. I liked him. From the first page until the end. He was there in your face. He was Rambo, Bruce Willis, and Arnold all in one. It took me a while to finish not because it wasn't interesting, it was, however, all that military stuff I could have done without, but the Satan thing was fun. I liked that the nun had a thing for Ike and Ike, (I just love this name glad it wasn't Jake) had a thing for the nun. Why is it when people think they are about to dye or maybe will dye,they can find time to make love. Brother! Whatever! Anyway, Good story, kind of slow, but good. the monsters, the fights, the deaths, all fun stuff. Most people should like it for the Journey to the Center of the Earth Aspect.I am looking forward to reading somthing else by him."
3,Great beginning with a so-so middle and not -so-great ending,This book has a great beginning. One of the best in recent memory. However the middle gets very slow and the ending is very unsatisfying with way too many unexplained and downright illogical events or non-events. I look forward to Jeff Longs next novel as this one shows great promise.
3,fast paced entertainment but a light weight read,"The Descent opens most promisingly. The first chapter will captivate your attention and keep you reading. The story moves well and will ultimately entertain. There are a number of places where the reader will have to suspend his/her mind but the subject matters grants such license. However, the reader looking for a more substantial discussion of good and evil (theodicy if you will), will be disappointed. It is hard for this reader to believe that any writer could entertain the subject of metaphysical evil and yet deal with it in so ephemeral a fashion. The most glaring omission is any place for God (ie, the good, the light, the truth, in the Western tradition). While I respect the courage of any writer to seriously entertain the subject of metaphysical evil and the existence of hell I would say that, in light of genius and influence of the likes of Dante and Milton, it is incumbant upon them to think more deeply."
1,"The dumbest, most low-brow read you'll ever enjoy","There are certain forms of entertainment which are somehow succesfully enjoyable despite what seems their best effort to fail. This book is one such guilty pleasure. I read it cover-to-cover in only two sittings, but make no mistake about it, this book is ridiculously bad. You'll be asking yourself, 'Did the editor just forget to read this section, or what?' and 'Did the author come up with this while watching B movies under the influence of certain unnamed controlled substances?' For all of that, though, you'll return right to it, despite yourself. I've never enjoyed having my intelligence insulted so much. I loved The Descent, despite the fact that it ranks slightly behind a mediocre superhero comic in terms of literary value. This is pure trash which, with the proper sense of humor and the right mood, you will thoroughly enjoy. What a piece of junk. God bless it."
1,"A nice Idea,misfired","It was a nice idea,but some of the subplots were just stupid. And the Satan thing is just beyond stupid. It was a nice premise that could have been good."
4,Just Enjoy The Ride,"This is one of those books where early on you have to decide if you are going to suspend your disbelief or not. This is just a pure adventure ride - bopping all around the world, secret cabals, mass slaughters, searches for Satan, trapped mountaineers, isolated African villages, mad billionaires, subterranean caverns, proto-humans, etc. If you're in the mood for something like that, you'll enjoy this book.I found it to be entertaining, one of those books that once you pick up, you don't want to put down, and you're thankful that it's 572 pages long because you know you'll be reading it for a while. I'll be checking out Jeff Long's other books now."
5,engrossing,"Starting with a bunch of short exciting chapters that introduce the main characters and the fantastic story idea, The Descent hooked me immediately. There's a lot going in this multileveled book but at its heart it is a great adventure tale. However, I also feel that the author tried to do too much with the story. Some chapters seem pointless and confusing and could be omitted. The main story line (of the Helios expedition) makes the book absolutely worthwhile but I think some of the ideas should have been used in separate (but related) books. I'd love to read a ""Descent"" series. The bottom line is I love the book and I'm still thinking about it long after finishing it."
5,Memorabilia Navideña by Tish Hinojosa,This is a very good Christmas CD. I lost my first copy and decided to buy it again.
5,akane tendo,"the first episode was like not too bad martial tea ceremony, the next was great! i loved it you should buy this video it is great !"
4,it does what it's supposed to do,nothing real pretty or special but it does what it's supposed to do! i works on a 1994 chevy c/k 1500 series pickup truck but just know that any stereo more that 6 1/2 inches deep will not fit just so you know if you haven't bought the stero yet make sure it is 6 1/2 inches or less deep. this is nothing to do with this product but is info you need to know if you have that truck. the black color goes pretty good most interiors. and this can be had in different colors at the scosche website but costs twice as much as this one. you may have a hard time finding the stereo plug in your truck too? it is directly under the steering wheel and you have to remove the cover there to get to it. :oP
2,Velvert Turner Group,Knowing that Velvert was a close friend of Jimi Hendrix inspired me to buy this disc. I did not particularly care for his material. There is no replacement for Hendrix.
4,Tuttle Learner's Chinese English Dictionary,"The book is well organized and easy to find information. I'm not too familiar with PinYin so I can't account for its accuracy. On the whole, book arrived within time period."
5,fantastic dictionary for learning chinese,"This is a wonderful dictionary, especially for learning Chinese. It is loaded with example sentences. Words are in alphabetical order by pinyin. Both simplified and traditional characters are shown for each word. All example sentences are in simplified form. I have been using this book as a learning tool by simply reading through it. I am learning characters by reading the example sentences in character form and then looking at the pinyin on the next line. I have read the first 50 pages and have already solidified at least 200 characters in my mind, and am gradually building familiarity for a couple thousand more. My pace of reading this dictionary is getting faster and faster as I become more familiar with the basic characters. Highly recommend."
5,"Get this book, very informative, comforting, a must read!","This book contains the answers to most, if not all, of your questions regarding how seizures and epilepsy will affect your child and family. It will also help you know which questions to ask your child's physicians. It is a most complete work. In five sections it describes why seizures occur, diagnosing, treating, coping, and living with epilepsy. Please do yourself a great favor and purchase this book. It is written in language a parent will understand without previous medical knowledge and also it is written with compassion and optimism. I have recommended this book to my family and friends who wish to understand more of how epilepsy is affecting my son's life. You won't be disappointed, buy it today!"
3,Excellent First Book after Diagnosis,"Excellent first book after you have received the diagnosis on your child. Good overview. After absorbing this information, you will want to move on to books that deal with the specific type of epilepsy with which your child has been diagnosed."
5,The Ultimate Collection,"for the ultimate fan. Do you know how crazy it was to anticipate this? How insane it was to see it in the stores and how giddy with excitement I was to finally bring it home? I have waited, prayed and wrote in so many times to have these released and then they go and do it in a BIG WAY. The packaging, the mastering and the bonus tracks. I can't thank the powers that be, enough. If you don't own this, you need to tie a yellow ribbon around your neck and tighten it until you remember to go pick it up or better yet, ask Santa to place it under your tree. Matter of fact, get EVERYTHING by them, this collection, the Christmas CD and the DVD boxed set. You'll be glad you did."
5,A valuable asset for any developer,"An excellent cookbook, following the old O'Reilly's tradition in the field. The recipes are clean, concise and elegant; the authors try to solve real world, common problems. Unlike other outdated books, the code is designed with PHP 4.2 or above in mind. A valuable asset for any developer, it assumes a decent understanding of PHP"
3,combo offer??,"This book is a collection of smallish code snippets that don't go into depth, but may be useful for your programming needs if you have very basic PHP knowledge.If you want a truly indepth cookbook withfull blown practical solutions that youcan reuse in your own applications, thenyou must own a copy of the ""PHP web developmentsolutions"" book from Wrox.I won both these books, and i have benefitted from reading the two..."
3,Cookbook's galore,"Among the PHP cookbooks in the market today, this one's good but lacks sufficient depth in coverage. It unfortunately has nothing more to offer than the PHP developers cookbook (II Edition). Infact,i found the latter to be more comprehensive and well-written. Another book, that is not actually labelled a cookbook, but is chockfull of completely re-usable solutions for web developers is the PHP4 Web Development Solutions book."
3,"WITH SOME DRAWBACKS, BUT STILL A GOOD BOOK","The main preoccupation of this book is finding solutions to common PHP programming problems. It contains a series of instructions on how best, programmers and/or web designers, who monitor dynamic web contents could apply scripting language. This book would arouse the interest of anyone who already knows the fundamentals of PHP.Its main drawback is that it is overtly abridged. Fledging PHP followers may criticize it for lacking the type of depth and practical application that non-advanced learners would want. Still, it is not a bad book to spend your wad on."
3,Masters of Teras Kasi,Decent for an older PS1 game. Newer games have better graphics. Its Star Wars so I added it to my collection.
5,Neat little poush,Got mine today. Fits the Zippo perfectly. Nice because it prevents any fluid spills in your pocket if the lighter is freshly filled.
1,The worst textbook ever!!,"The book is rather poorly written from the sense that the author eliminates a lot of steps in the problems-solving sections and assumes that the reader knows what the steps are. This is in contrary to the statement in the preface that this book is dedicated for undergraduate engineers and scientists at junior or senior levels!There are not adequate examples related to the theorems given. In the exercise section, the author often comes up with difficult questions that are from out of nowhere in the text.I don't recommend this book if you do not have a previous knowledge of PDE (although the title spells out ""An Introduction""). One old book which is very good is ""Partial Differential Equations for Scientists and Engineers"" by Tyn Myint-U, PhD from Manhattan College, NY. It was published in 1987 w/ ISBN: 0-444-01173-0. Probably you won't get it anywhere except from your school's library."
2,A Poor Text,"My biggest problem with this book is that the author states what is blindingly obvious but fails to examine some of the more subtle areas. It seems that by stating that a double integral is for two dimension and a triple for three one is just filling up space. Most of the remarks are of this kind. The exercises, furthermore, are not inspired. They are mostly just complete the proof, or redo the proof for a different dimension type of problems. While such questions are required, there are no questions which explore the finer details of the subject.Moreover, there seems to be no feeling of continuity. It's a very staggered flow and does not make for enjoyable reading. The lack of discussion, rigorous proofs, precise definitions for such a rich subject makes this text almost worthless. Perhaps covering less but in greater detail would serve better as an introduction to PDEs."
2,Explanations are weak!,"This book is written from the following point of view: You have alredy been exposed to PDEs in the past, used a different and better book, and are now refreshing your knowledge. Strauss ""concisely"" and quickly moves through topics and simply highlights the obvious stuff you should have learned. Strauss is a good reference book for quick review, but not especially good for those adverse to equation reading rather than words."
1,Disappointing,"I read the first 6 chapters of this book and I have to say I'm disappointed.The good:1. The book is well written in the sense you can tell the author is excited about the subject and he tries to share that excitement with the reader.The bad:1. This book is not mathematically precise enough.2. There are typos everywhere, there is an erratta, but I have still found some typos.3. The book is not well written in the sense that the author doesn't explain the mathematical concepts well enough.I give this a 1/5 simply because the typos caused me a great deal of time and the vagueness at times just brought upon lots of confusion."
2,A poorly written text that's not for beginners.,"Developing an understanding of PDE's is a tough task, don't make it tougher by using this book (unless you are already somewhat familiar with the subject)! This text is extremely difficult to follow if one is new to partial differential equations. I used it several years ago when I took an undergrad course in the subject and found that the presentation of the material was too concise and the exercises unhelpful. If you're looking for a decent intro text for self study try ""Basic Partial Differential Equations"" by Bleecker and Csordas."
2,Supplement only,"I used this book in my PDE class. Unfortunately, I have to self-study only, which makes the completeness of the book very important for me. On this issue, the book fails pretty badly. I think it would be great in conjunction with class attendance, a good professor, and/or other PDE texts though."
5,AWESOME PROGRAM,"This is another great program from Hooked on Phonics. I have purchased earlier products from Hooked on Phonics, and I have been very pleased in the past. I am a teacher and my daughter is a good reader; however, I purchased this program to work with her over the summer while she transitions from second to third grade. She loves this program. It does not seem like a chore, and she enjoys using the computer. The readings are interesting, and one should never stop learning, even if it is summer break! I highly recommend it for struggling readers and for those who are not necessarily struggling readers but would like to sharpen their skills. My daughter asked me to post this review because she thinks this product is fantastic!"
3,"Great Band, Good Music","They sound like DM and play electronic pop very well. They are trying a different style of electronic pop music in the disc but I like their first CD more. Anyway, also a good CD."
2,Poor quality...,"I order the sound track of one of the greatest movie (at least to me). Disc is not in good quality, I would say poor. It has scraches and skip almost every other track (I did all my best to recover the damages, not possible). I am disappointed and unfortunatelly I will not play the disc at all."
5,Best music! Recommended 100%,"Musica que eleva el espiritu humano, se las recomiendo 100%.El Sr Morricone nos enseña que la humanidad aun tiene esperanza en este mundo lleno de corrupcion y bajesa, gracias Don Ennio, es usted con esta musica un oasis en el desierto."
5,Brilliant Composer,"Love this composer. The music draws out emotion. If you love movie music, this is definitely a must have. My kids-boys love it!"
5,Carb adjusting tool,Needed the tool to adjust carburator for chain saw. Worked just perfectly and it was repaired within minutes! It was a great price to boot! Thanks!
5,Save a few bucks...,"Great fast service, no issues what so ever.Everything as stated, mail service fast and reasonable.Would reuse them again."
4,carburator adjusting tool,tool is adequit does job well should be labeled differantly such as what size the tool is and that it will work on more than just (poulin weed eaters)
4,Genuine Poulan Weedeater Part # 530035560 Carb Adjusting Tool,This tool works great on the poulan pro weedeater that i had purchased. when i brought the weedeater home it would now rev. up much past idle. I got the tool & made adjustments runs fine now.
3,Poulan Carb Adjusting Tool,"The splined socket on mine is not aligned with the shaft, but it is useable. I would return it for a proper one , but it is not worth the trouble and expense. I guess they count on that."
3,works,It works but the socket end is welded on crooked. But what do you expect for three bucks. Just weird that you have to buy this tool when Poulan can just use regular phillips screws
4,A planned obsolesence item.,"Poulan knows that if you can't adjust the carb screws, you will probably just buy a new weedeater or blower every couple of years because the one you have will no longer run . I just use my Dremmel to grind slots in the top of the screws so I can adjust with a normal screwdriver. Planned obsolescence is a real nuisance. Poulan will probably claim that some EPA rule is involved requiring adjustment only by a ""certified"" technician."
5,If you own a chain saw your going to need this eventually.,"I struggled for months with a chainsaw that needed a slight adjustment to the carb. I guess after a while they just go out of calibration. Maybe it's all the vibration, I don't know. As soon as I got this in the mail my saw was back to normal. It also works on poulan and weed wacker brand trimmers. Buy it! Oh, and forget about finding it anywhere elese."
2,doesn't work on craftsman,Bought this tool hoping it would work on my craftsman weed eater. Tool does not work just bought the weed eater a week ago and had issues with carb. having same issue with craftsman blower. bought tool and didn't work.. just have to try another type of carb tool.
1,"Obviously Defective, Totally Unusable Carb Adjusting Tool",If Poulan actually produced this tool it was fished out of the reject pile.1: The sleeve's internal splines are filled with copper brazing used to attach the sleeve to the shaft.2: The sleeve is cocked off the center line of the shaft so far that it cannot be used to adjust the carb.3: It does not fit the Poulan Pro Chainsaw that Poulan # 530035560 Carb Adjusting Tool fits.
4,Does The Job,Easily fits over adjusting pins and allows you to fine-tune the carb...this tool should be readily available at hardware stores at half the price.
3,carb adjuster,"a must to adjust the low high adjustment on a poulan chain saw,don't know why poulan didn't slot the screws"
4,Worked on my Husqvarna,"Worked on my Husqvarna, had no issues. Seems cheaply made, but it's not something that should be put through a lot of hard use, so i'm sure it'll be fine. However, 10 bucks for a cheap screwdriver is a tad more than i think i should have had to pay, so no 5 star on this."
5,good,the tool did the job as intendedthe built is okno cons at this pointfinally have à weedeater that s working
1,Junk!!,"Don't buy this from Mowtown. The socket that contains the splines is pushed onto a screwdriver handle. The socket is crooked. Meaning as the screwdriver handle is turned, the socket wobbles. It wobbles to the point where the carb can't be adjusted.Very poor quality tool."
4,doew the job,This product does the job. It adjusted the jets as advertised. Very cheaply made handle and I don't know about the quality of the blade but for individual use it is OK.
4,Great!,I really like Gain laundry detergent. I recently bought the Gain with the Island Fresh scent and I do think I like it better. It smells cleaner to me.
1,"""Gooder""! They can't even speak correct English!!!","Their commercial on 3/1/2011 used the non-word ""gooder"" not once, but at least twice. I don't want anything that might teach my children incorrect English in our house, no matter how good it is!The only way to teach them that language is important is if we all stopped buying their products. At least for until they change their ways!"
2,Book good content useless,"This book was interesting and imformative, if you have 100million dollars to dedicate to a project. Contrite alliteration and pathetic ogies lead to an uninspiring read. It would benifit from practical imformation and instructions"
2,Not worth the money!!,"Jon Bell is proberbly an exelent 3D modeller/animator, but this book is far from the quality of Inside 3D Studio Max. The tutorials are a bit oldfasioned, and the book is way to thick compared to the information in it."
1,And the verdict is...baffling.,"The price tag on this item is hard to understand. Buy the MP3 files and not the box with the pretty package. It's all fantastic Stranglers music, but why would it cost big bucks? Five stars for the music, minus four for the price. I have just about all of these tracks on 45-rpm records. I think I have them all digitally as well. And I'm pretty sure they're all available for much cheaper than this collection's price in other packages. So why does this cost so much, again? Is this Depeche Mode? Strange, strange, strange."
3,All Paper,"I assumed (incorrectly) that this would have a hard cover. Its a paperback. I do like the fact that you can take as many lines as you need for each address entry... its not sectioned off with 3 or 4 lines per entry. That works well for me. I just dont expect it to last all that long because its going to go in my handbag or travel/tote bag. Its not even especially heavy stock for the cover, so I expect maybe 3 years of use at the most."
2,Great Toy - Poor quality,"This sewing machine is the only item my daughter had in her list to Santa. She spoke of nothing else but this sewing machine when asked what she wanted for Christmas. I was delighted to obtain one through Amazon(after item was backordered until January on my original order from another vendor). I was disappointed that upon removal from the original packaging, the tension dial was broken and could not be attached properly to the ""machine"". The entire unit is plastic and made (not very well)in China as it seems most products are of late. My child DID notice but DID NOT seem to mind that the tension dial was broken and not working properly. She has played and ""sewn"" for hours since Christmas Day."
3,I Wasn't Blown Away,"This is definitely a books you'll enjoy a lot more if you've lived in or are intimately familiar with San Francisco's Mission district. That's because the story of a city social worker who bends the rules to help people out, goes drinking with her workmates, and is working on her third husband, isn't all that fascinating in and of itself. There is a good sense of atmosphere throughout, but it would be a lot more compelling if I knew the area and people at the heart of the narrative."
4,Good practical guide for most amateur astronomers,Written in a nice friendly style this book offers much for the aspiring newcomer to astronomy and even many adavanced amateurs. Perhaps a little biased towards dobsonian telescopes but a worthwhile practical read overall.
5,All the questions you were afraid to ask.,"Entering such a esoteric or eclectic hobby as astronomy is daunting. We are expected to already know common facts. Sadly beginners don't. Perhaps this is why there is such a large drop-out rate of budding astronomers. We are afraid to ask basic questions, let alone complex ones. This book is such a god-send. It captivates the reader and imparts such enthusiasm that it encourages all to be involved with watching what we are made of."
5,This is a winner. Great for newbies and experts alike. Good price too !!,"For newbies, the sections on preparation for stargazing and selecting a scope are fabulous. It's embarassing to misprounounce celestial objects, and the phonetic spelling of these was a nice touch. I had seen some of the scope hacks in a handful of other books, but it's all here. The book price isn't bad either !!"
5,A really good resource,"In a word, wow. I like to actually read all of a book before making comments, and there is a lot of content in this book, so it took me a while to get all the way through it. As someone with a very minimal background and marginal interest in astronomy, I would feel very comfortable using this as my primary guide if I was going to start observing at most any level; I had no trouble following the text, even the technical information and tables looked like I would be able to understand and use them if I had the need to do so. Well written. This strikes me as an essential resource for any neophyte, one that includes useful information for experienced folks as well."
5,"The second book you need for your telescope, after a good observing guide","I wasn't sure what to expect when I ordered this book. I was amazed at how well thought out the ""hacks"" were and the authors take the time to explain the why of the ""hack"" with plenty of detail. Their handling of the different topics are from the perspective of what they found works well, but they take the time to address alternate viewpoints and the relative merits of each (an example is their handling of the red-dot sight vs Telrad vs Rigel Qwikfinder debate, some very useful information there!).This is a definite ""must have"" book for any telescope owner (they handle dobs extremely well in this book), and is the second book you need to buy after choosing a good observing guide."
5,Riveting,"My eyes were riveted to the screen from the moment the actress came into view. I don't watch a lot of silent films, but voices would have been a distraction from the incredible emotion on her face. The scenes are primarily facial close-ups from Joan, to the Bishop, to other Priests, and back to Joan as she faces her trial, her sentencing, and her own demons. What an incredible actress! Most of our actors today could not hold a candle to her!Those who can:Boys Don't CryThe AccusedJoan of Arc"
5,A masterpiece unlike any other,"Words fail me when trying to describe this movie... It is so completely different than any other film I have seen, both in terms of technique and effect. Somehow it manages to be about faith and spiritual strength, difficult enough in a sound film, astounding in a silent. Watching Falconetti in the early scenes, as she tries to answer the questions without uttering heresy, you can see panic give way to inspiration, then to steely confidence, all reflected in her eyes. Though the music on this disc is very good, I recommend watching the movie silent, as the rhythms of the editing are so powerful in and of themselves. The picture quality is uniformly excellent on this DVD- the tonal range and detail of the (gorgeous) photography look magnificent. Dreyer breaks so many conventions of filmmaking that the emotional impact produced is utterly unique, both in its intensity and its quality. An absolute masterpiece on every level."
3,The Emperor's new clothes?,"Damn me for a philistine, but I'm afraid that I didn't like the film very much. What put me off were the never-ending tight close-ups of Joan's face, the way she would telegraph her feelings for thirty seconds before making even the briefest answer, and her apparent inability to hold her head up straight. Though Ms Falconetti's is one of the most expressive faces I've ever seen, her telegraphing and the odd camera work made her seem just a bit weird. I found myself thinking: ""Oh, enough with the eyes already! Just answer the question.""But what do I know?"
4,Beautiful!,"I was amazed at the clarity of the film for a picture made in the late '20s. I really liked how the camera closely examined the faces of the characters. It seemed to bring out more emotion. I highly recommend this movie to silent film fans and I also suggest watching the movie using the option for the ""Voices of Light"" score. This really seemed to add to the sadness and it also amplified the climax."
5,The best movie I've ever seen,"Saint Joan had to wait 500 years for her canonization. The injustice! But this film atones and makes her victory all the more glorious! I wept and wept and wept, and still do occasionally when I but think of Maria Falconetti's face bringing to life Joan's plight. The Saint lived through Maria in this film. Words cannot express, as this silent film proves. The music is wonderful in its own right, and complements the film perfectly. Just buy it. Now."
5,The strangest thing...,"This truly is one of the most powerful experiences ever put on film, and easily one of the most powerful of screen performances by Falconetti. Absolutely. But the strangest, and maybe even most wonderful, thing about this picture is that it is ADDICTIVE. At least for me anyhow, certainly not for everybody. Something about this film seems to make me want to watch it over and over, almost relentlessly. I'm a huge fan of austere and often slow moving works of film, such as everything by Ingmar Bergman and Andrei Tarkovsky, but I wouldn't call their work addictive. Brilliant, yes...but not addictive. But somehow, Dreyer has done that with this film. For me at least. And it is even more so with Richard Einhorn's new score, which is absolutely incredible. Anyhow...yeah, that's what I've got to say about that."
5,This is the most incredible film I've ever seen,"I've seen this film twice in live performance with Einhorn's score, and both times I had to stifle myself from sobbing out loud. This film will tear your heart up inside of your body. It takes days to heal after watching it. No kidding. The cinematography is brilliant, but what really makes the movie is Falconetti's performance as Joan. It's absolutely heartbreaking, and I would recommend this film to anyone, even if you don't think you like silent movies. There's nothing silent about this one. It screams with emotion."
4,Too much fiction but otherwise outstanding.,"I must recommend this movie. The acting is outstanding. I only wish the movie had less fiction. For example the ending, after the burning of Joan, is not even close to the truth. However, much of the movie is close to the truth.I don't know why directors feel they can improve on the facts with Joan of Arc. In her case the truth is amazing enough and substuting fiction for fact is not an improvement. However, no movie about Joan of Arc is void of fiction."
4,Get the facts straight,"I agree with Dr. Jason Miller that someone should get the facts right. Truth is above and beyond emotion. People would be more impressed and amazed at what really happened. Although the film is very good, I already knew the real story and was disappointed that some important truths were changed or left out, especially the fact that Joan's accusers were acting outside the authority of the Church and in secret."
5,"Yes, most likely the greatest film ever made","I can add nothing to the almost unanimous 5 stars that everyone has given this film. I also agree that it is most likely the greatest film ever made. Not only was it way ahead of its time but it is clear that many of the camera techniques used here were later picked up by Welles for his Citizen Kane. But what no reviewer of this film can get away with is failing to confirm the performance of Maria Falconetti as the greatest acting ever put on film. In fact calling it acting is too simple. Too shallow. It is beyond that. It is transcendental. That IS Joan of Arc we're watching.Everytime I see her I am drained of emotion watching her abject desolation. Nothing equals it. Nothing comes close. THIS is what total despair looks like. All other later performances, in any film, attempting to achieve this level of intensity, completely fails by comparison. What I wouldn't have given to see just one other film performance by this remarkable actress."
5,"Human, All Too Human","By turns bold, subtle, rapturous, bitter, elegiac, haunting-Carl Dreyer's vision of Joan will be reckoned in the company of such stalwart dignitaries as Hamlet, The Mona Lisa and Beethoven's 9th as one of the finest aesthetic achievements on record. Insofar as film can survive its current decline amid the watery hubris of pop culture revisionism, we will have masterpieces like The Passion of Joan of Arc to thank for reminding us just how poignant the moving image can be. So much so that perhaps, just perhaps, to dismiss this unearthly beauty is to forfeit one's stake in the notion of beauty altogether."
3,Works good but not on all vehicles,This is possibly the most comfortable item invented for an arm rest but beware of advertisement that tell you it fits all vehicles. Not So. It will not fit a Dodge Aspen and probably a few more I don't know about. It works fine in my Chevy truck but you can loose it if your not careful when the window is down.
5,"Good product, but won't fit all.","I bought this for my dodge Caliber, and it didn't fit (it wasn't wide enough). I gave it to my dad for his dodge Dakota and he loved it. Unfortunately it flew out of the window since he didn't secured it as recomended by the manufacturer."
2,Armrest not for all vehicles!,"Bought this armrest for my 2009 Dodge Journey. The armrest does not fit the door panel. It seems well built and would have certainly been comfortable, but not on this vehicle."
3,Rehash of Essays from IEEE Software,"This not a bad book, but if you happen to read IEEE Software regularly, there is almost nothing new. I have not yet read the whole book, and Davis claims that he has updated the original articles, but most of the stuff has not changed.On the other hand, if you have not read the articles before, they are quite fun to read, e.g. ""Art or Engineering, One More Time"".But I have an issue with the title: the ""debates"" are mostly some paragraphs at the end of the article, that are more like questions in a text book that might start a debate, but do not really dig into a controversial issue.I very much prefer, Robert E. Glass': ""Facts and Fallacies of Software Engineering"", which contains similiar topics, but is much more to the point. And makes the controversies on his issues much more explicit.Funnily, Glass, on the other hand, thinks very highly of an older book of Davis': ""201 Principles of Software Development"""
2,a bit disappointing,"Bought this expecting it to both teach composition and provide composition software, and for the price that was a resonable assumption. Well, it does have a lot in there about many aspects of music theory and composition, but it doesn't really stand alone well. It would work much better in conjunction with a teacher, and was probably intended to be used in a classroom setting. Not exactly what I was looking for. And the composition software is pre-notation--also not what I was looking for. I wanted soemthing that allows composition on a staff, using standard notation, embellished with all the various notations too (trills, ties, dotted notes, etc., etc.). For that, Sibelius First does the trick very well. I was hoping to get a better level of stand-alone instruction and traditional compostion software all in one with Compass, but that's not what it does. Too bad--such a combo program would be nice."
2,upside down logo,"and the picture shows ""49ers"" as well as the SF and the shirt had an upside down SF...no 49ers."
2,Suzuki Vinson Warn Plow Mount,"I installed a Warn snow plow on my 2005 Suzuki Vinson. As I was doing so, I noticed that there was already a Cycle Country plow mount on the ATV. I wish I had noticed before, because the Cycle Country mount was SO MUCH EASIER TO INSTALL than the Warn. To install the Warn, you have to drill holes through the skid plate, then push four U bolts over frame tubes, through your drilled holes and through holes in the mounting plate. And oh, by the way, don't drill through anything that you shouldn't... I finally got it installed, but ended up really wishing that I had bought the Cycle Country plow instead. The Cycle Country mount just mounts directly into two pre-existing large, beefy bolt holes on each side of the ATV frame; it is about a 10 minute job. The Warn mount took me about 1.5-2 hours. Other than the hassle of installing Warn's mount, my Warn snow plow has worked well though."
5,"An old(in years) ""Late Tuesday"" fan","This is really great music. I first heard this on Internet radio. I bought one album and now I have all three. I liked this group so much; I went to there show in the middle of Washington. This was a 1360-mile trip, and I wasn't disappointed, it was great. I believe I like the "" Looking for Flowers Again"" album a little more than this one. Others have described the music better than I can, but I can say it is very up-building music."
1,Do Not Pronise What you cannot deliver,"This stuff is too repetitive from the previous Black book. Not enough material on 4.0 They also included proprietary stuff that is not standardized that should have been pointed out specifically.They did not follow thorugh with the web site. The book claims that the site is up, but the site was retruning a 404 error. Finally it appeared and they said it woul be up on the in May. Then they said it would be up June 15th. Then it was not up then. I have lost total patience with IDG."
3,Useful and convenient. Buy it.,"I found this book to be quite useful to have. I learned HTML from it quite easily by taking the commands one at a time and writing a practice page.There are a few problems with it, but on the whole they are very minor. I might have organized it a bit differently, but then again, the way it is has its advantages.I have downloaded the official and complete HTML 4.0 reference, which I printed out and it fills a 3"" ring binder with an awful lot of pages filled with mostly incomprehensible stuff. Should I need to reseach something esoteric I can go to it, but it is definately a reference of last resortSince this book is small and concise, I feel it is a good book to have, and where I look first."
4,GREAT for a Reference Guide,"I borrowed the book from a friend. Knew nothing about coding HTML (could read html, just not code) and within 3 hours I had a full test website with links, tables, images, background all the basics. I am now getting into the forms and such. GREAT BOOK, I am online now to buy it for myself!"
5,Dream Book,"I drool over the pictures in this book while I imagine my dream home. l like that Jane Powell suggests 2 versions of most kitchen ideas. One is a restoration, but the other is a practical version, using modern amenities and sources, at a reasonable cost, while staying true to the bungalow aesthetic."
3,Interesting but sometimes impratical,"""Bungalow Kitchens"" offers an outstanding historical perspective on the use and layout of the kitchen in bungalow homes. As someone who is in the process of restoration/rennovation of a 1920s bungalow I found the suggestions for restoration a bit unforgiving however. I felt the breakdown on restoration ideas into the two catagories of ""obsessive"" and ""compromise"" to be a good idea for presenting rennovation ideas. However, even the compromise ideas seem to be impratical for someone who will continue to use their bungalow kitchen frequently. I had hoped the author would have dedicated more time towards rennovating bungalow kitchens using materials of the present day. A more complete discussion of maintaining the character of the bungalow kitchen using modern materials and amenities would have been more useful to those of us embarking on a ""semi-restoration"" effort."
4,Cool Kitchens,"This book contains an excellent collection of photos of Arts & Crafts period kitchens. It discusses the philosophy of design Gustav Stickley and others advocated and shows you the results, which are still beautiful, even after all these years. It is a little short on detail, if you wanted to reproduce the look of the Arts & Crafts kitchen, but it does spark the imagination. The examples of various kitchens is broken down by designer, so it is easy to pick out their specific design influence. I found this book an inspiration for some of the designs I would like incorporate in my own home, and combined with some other books of design details, it is excellent."
3,nice but not exiting,"I,ve got used to Toby Keiths strong delivery and this album though well produced and very clear to listen to, it does not not have the ooomph I,m used to. However I shall get the next solo album and trust that we shall get a little more rock/country."
4,Great Soundtrack,"This soundtrack is fantastic. Toby's songs are over the top. There is one song that I heard during the movie, that doesn't appear in the soundtrack. It is the song playing on the radio when Toby and his ex-girlfriend are driving toward the ""party"" that Dixie is at. Does anyone know what the name of the song is and why wasn't it included in the soundtrack?"
5,Great,I love Tobby Keith and the movie was heart warming.. I loved the story and the music..I would love to see another movie like it
2,Why destroy what could have been great,If your looking for a warcraft or C&C type game using starwars stuff This isn't it. The game play ability was poor and slow. It was boring to the point of falling asleep. I played this game in a group of 4 people on a lan for around 6 hours just trying to squeez some fun out of it. Unfortunatly my friends and I all believed the game was a let down and of poor challenge quallity. Be wise and don't buy .
1,"Stinks, stinks, stinks!","I have played many RTS games in my day, and let me tell you, this game stinks. It has the crappiest interface that I've ever seen. The graphics are pretty good, but you can only get by with pretty graphics for so long. This could have been a MUCH better game if Lucas Arts hadn't blown it with the trashy interface. Its no fun to play because you spend all your time fiddling with the camera views. I get so frustrated with the stupid camera that the game is no longer fun. If you've never played a great RTS, you might not mind it, but after playing Starcraft and Age of Empires (I & II) I can't stand the way this games works."
2,This is one of the poorer Lucasarts game,"I love Lucasarts. They do great work. This game is not that good, though. It's graphics are too blocky and gameplay is slow. Another problem is the sideways viewpoint which distorts everything. The blue boxes around the units are also very annoying, especially around the small units such as stormtroopers because you can't make out the units. The environments look bland and uninteresting too. I was looking forward to Force Commander because I like RTS games and the last Lucasarts RTS, Rebellion, was a joke, but now I realize Force Commander is just another game that could have been great but the devolopers just didn't refine it enough. Anyway, I recommend you save your money and get something else."
3,"Star Wars fans will love it, others...","If you are already familiar with Startcraft, Command & Conquer and dozens of simillar games, this game as nothing new to offer, you will probably quit after a few hours of gameplay. As soon as the novelty effect passes. If on the other hand you are a Star Wars fan, you will find added value to the game, because of the atmosphere mainly. Personally i got bored after 6 missions, the graphics don't offer nothing new, and the camera views is more troublesome than useful. If you have no game of the genre, it's a good purchase, otherwise stick to Starcraft..."
3,need more stuff,this site is verry good but i would like to see more from the original series like the movies
3,Not pleased,For the steep requirments you would think that the game would look better. The combat interface takes up too much of the screen. Units walk right through buildings. The command point system is a pain in the ass. Most battles come down to a war of attrition with very little strategy comming into play. I would have given this game only one star but I am a big Star Wars fan.
3,Why all the fuss?,"Alright. If your getting this game thinking that its going to be just like Starcraft with Star Wras units, then your going to be somewhat dissappointed. I had just purchased the game and read all these reviews dumping on it so, needless to say, I was pretty worried when I popped the cd into my system. But all in all, its not THAT bad. I mean, its pretty cool. Graphics are killer, control is decent. Controlling the camera angel can be a pain, but you get used to it after awhile. The only real complaints I have it 1) Its kinda slow. Not any of the fast, action paced battles I can get from Starcraft. 2) No real strategy needed. I mean, of course you need SOME basic strategy, but nothing that really takes any brain power. Its pretty much just "" Grab your forces and go "" kinda game. But all in all, its a decent game. But I would advise waiting till the price goes down before buying."
1,Not worth the money,"I was eagerly anticipating the release of this game. My system more than meets the hardware requirements, but I must say that it's hard to enjoy a game when it continually locks up less than 3 minutes into playing it. Save your money!"
1,A Devoted Star Wars Fan who Thinks this Game is Terrible,"CNET GameCenter gave Force Commander barely 3 starts out of 10. That's one of the worst scores I've seen GameCenter dish out. The game has received near universal bad reviews. I bought Force Commander before it came out on March 20 and played it before I read the reviews, so my opinion is not affected by any reviews: Apart from the Star Wars background, this game has poor entertainment value relative to other RTS games. The camera handling and interface is awful! Look at the screenshots: the interface is a gigantic black box taking up almost a third of the screen. The graphics are blocky and dated--especially the humanoid figures. The AI is substandard (imagine all your units bumping into each other like a pinball machine for several seconds trying to get thru a narrow passage--and there's a lot of narrow passages by the way; meanwhile they're being picked off by enemy units) ...."
1,Slop,"Dreadful cut scenes, wierd David Lynch music whilst being briefed and a pathetic interface. What is the point in that camera flexibility when you can only play it from one view? Really bad. I keep trying to play it, I really do, but to no avail."
5,"we""ve spotted imperial walkers on the north ridge!","there is only one thing i can say about FORCE COMMANDER- AWESOME! from the minute you put the game into your computer and the credits roll, you're drawn into the star wars universe! the graphics are incredible, from the walking dewbacks to the stormtroopers firing their blasters at tusken raiders, they are breathtaking! I've only had it less than 24hrs and i am hooked! The only way lucasarts could top this one is if they released a cd soundtrack of the games music. again, the music is awesome! the classic john williams score combined with modern day techno and metal. it is like star wars nine inch nails! hope this review helped you out and buy force commander- you'll be glad you did-trust me and may the force be with you!"
2,Dissapointing,"I am a true Star Wars fan and I collect everything and love all the movies but this was definatley not an enjoyable game. Sadley the gameplay did not come natural, so there was a learning curve. The graphics were behind the times and character movement was horribloe. I even often found AT-ST getting stuck up against a wall and unmoveable - a total frustrating moment. Yes this is Star Wars and yes it is great on that respect. However compare it to any RTS that came out a few years prior to it and you would be still dissapointed. I'm sure Lucasarts will try again soon, hopefully..."
2,"slow gameplay, some glitches","I found Star Wars fun at first but its lasting appeal died off fast and the levels and gameplay were very slow. There were a couple annoying gltches, including a menu glitch which made it impossible to read the menu. Finally the graphics are not so good. Not very impressive for a lucas arts game. But if you are a die hard star wars fan it would be a pretty fun game."
2,Nice but Not all that,"Nice game for the first two levels, but the little things make the difference; such as bunkers cannot fire and only hold two soldiers. The game gets confusing and the story jets off in certain points. A much better game of the same genre is Ground Control. FOCOM also is very unrealistic because AT-ST's cannot destroy soldiers well at all. Another downside of this game is the unit limit, which is very annoying. 2 stars is very fair if not nice for this game."
2,Becareful of this game!,"I was very disappointed when I stuck the game in my AMD K7-600 machine and found out that it even slowed my computer down. I do have to admit the graphics are outstanding, but graphics don't help much if you can't play the game. I did check Lucas Arts site and they said that to run it you had to have 85% of your resources free. Not an easy thing to do considering all the stuff I have on my computer. I am hoping that adding another 128 MB chip into my computer will correct the problem. If it does I will resubmit my review. It is a great looking game. I am just hoping it isn't my Creative Labs TNT2 Ultra 32MB video card."
2,Disappointing at Best,"Looks like LucasArts has done it again: a great storyline and great cutscenes mixed with a slow, akward interface. Sure, the colors are all there and 3D is everywhere, but zooming in closer shows the boxy troops and vehicles, with very low detail compared to many games of today. The learning curve is steep, and new players can't even adjust the difficulty. In conclusion: hard to control, hard to see what's happening, and hard to think why LucasArts couldn't have done better."
5,Best Star Wars Game to Date!,"From early screenshots, this game looks hot! The only downside I could find was that when playing the game, you collect ""command points"" which allow you to recieve new vehicles for your team. So, you can't go into a battle with let's say 20 At-Ats because command points are lost. Otherwise, this game looks very promising and enjoyable!"
3,Not what I hoped,"I bought this pedometer because it has all the features that I want. Love the pulse rate monitor, but you get a different reading depending on which finger you use. Not really an issue since it's supposed to be just a guide. The biggest problem I have is that once attached to my pants, all I have to do is turn sideways, wiggle my body, move my leg up and down or any other minor movement and the pedometer increases. One day while at my desk I put on 4000 steps!! The direction book doesn't have any info on how to change this so, I don't really have an accurate account of my steps. If your goal is to get in 10,000 steps a day, this isn't really the tool to use because of its sensitivity. If you're only using it during your workout, it's a good tool."
3,BIG EAR BUDS,"ALL I REALLY NEEDED WAS JUST THE ADAPTOR PART MY OLD ONE SHORTED OUT, THIS ADAPTOR WORKS GREAT, THE EAR BUDS ON THE OTHER HAND ARE RATHER LARGE AND FIT INTO YOUR EAR NOT SO NICELY, BUT THE ADAPTOR WORKS GREAT"
1,DOES NOT WORK,"This item does not work at all. Actual target size is about 2.5 inches. Good luck hitting it. Directions recommend standing back 90 feet. I had to stand so close to make the target even move that the paint would actually splatter on me. It is solid steel but thats the problem. The paintball is not strong enough to make the target swing into the up position. Also, the target is only 1 foot off the floor because your supposed to stake it into the ground. Your always shooting downward unless you lay on the floor. Save your money, shoot an empty can. This item may be better suited for real bullets."
3,was it worth it?,nice target but VERY small.. looks way bigger in the picture.. what was bad about it was that it was missing a piece.. and one of the targets didnt work like it should.. i had to drill out the screw hole to fit a replacement piece in.. more of a pain then anything.. overall it was only ok... shipping was pretty bad... package was torn and it came late...
4,Story Starters,"I love this product! My kindergartens continuously write ""I like dogs. I like my mom. I like cats."" It is nice to get them writing about different subjects. The only downfall for this product is, after daily use the pictures start to come off of the dice. It would be great if they made regular dice with pictures (a little more durable)."
4,A great toy to use your imagination.,My 4 year old wasn't crazy about this toy but I think it might be the age. Her attention span isn't that long. I'm still glad I bought it and intend to play it with her a little later.
1,Another physician,I too am a doc who is in this...i have been in our local dallas magazine as well. My experiance is similar to another reviewer. They send you the notification and ask you to buy a very expensive plaque or take out incredibly expensive ad space. I too think anyone would be better served asking their physician for a recommendation or checking with the referral service at the local teaching institution.
4,Dummies work everytime!,"I have used the ""Dummies"" books for many years. Ihave found them all very helpful. The layout is always easy to followand the lanuage is easily understood. This book is no different. Within an hour I had learned the difference between Word 95 and Word 2000. I found easy ways to transfer info from Works 4.5 to this version. I tried to do these things before I got this book. I could not make the tasks work. This book was a good investment because it will allow me to get everything out of Works suite 2000 possible. I would recommend this book to save yourself some headaches."
1,BUY SOMETHING ELSE....ANYTHING BUT THIS,I'VE OWNED MINE FOR ABOUT 6 MONTHS. IT HAS BROKEN DOWN THREE(3) TIMES. ALL FOR THE SAME REASON (MAGNETRON). AVERAGE TIME TO FIX IS ABOUT 2 WEEKS FOR ME. IT IS CURRENTLY IN THE REPAIR SHOP AND I DON'T HAVE A WORKING MICROWAVE IN MY HOUSE. LG CUSTOMER SERVICE IS A JOKE AND SO ARE THEIR PRODUCTS. FUNNY THING IS THAT I AM NOT LAUGHING.
1,Absolute Junk,"This piece of rubbish died within a week of delivery. It magically resurrected by the time the maintenance guy came out but now, six months later, it's gone again. All the lights, whistles and bells work but it does not heat. Really disappointed. I just wish I could give it minus stars."
3,Living Gods vs. False Gods,"If you've happened to notice AEG has retitled the ""Living Gods"" manual as ""False Gods"". When I emailed their customer support about this change, and any other content change within, I received no response.I also noticed that Amazon has been preselling the 6th manual in this series, but AEG does not show it on their website (need I email them ???)Don't get me wrong, I like the show, and the books are chock-full-of good info, but if you're looking for clarification, as any good GM will tell you... make it up as you go..."
4,Great Bluegrass,"I had never heard of Chris Thile until I saw his band doing their rendition of Dead Leaves and the Dirty Ground on CMT. Some of the songs are not traditional bluegrass, but they are good jams none-the-less."
3,A More Traditional Country Music Feel,"Chris Thile's musicianship comes through on this album, but I don't like it as much as some of his other stuff. It's got much more of a country music feel and I prefer his stuff that's more classical influenced -- or more folk/rock."
2,An average album ruined by the F word,"I agree with Solocoyote's review 100%. Why Chris decided it was necessary to put the F word into this album is beyond me. Did he want to appear tough or to be taken more seriously? It's truly a shame. I loved the last Nickel Creek album (one of the few country-ish groups I enjoy as I mostly listen to alternative music) and thought I would enjoy this CD, too. Some of the songs are really good, especially ""You're an Angel, And I'm Gonna Cry."" Also, the instrumental tracks are really fun because it allows everybody to go crazy with their instruments. A lot of the songs, though, are boring and uninspired and left me wanting more. ""Heart In A Cage"" ruins the album for me, though, with unneccessary language. Unfortunately, I'll probably never buy another Thile or Nickel Creek CD because of this. Hopefully, using this word was worth it for him."
3,WTF?,"I don't know what to say. I was enjoying this album immensely. Just as much as my NickelCreek albums. Until Chris decided he needed to use the ""f"" word.Call me old fashioned but I am incredibly dissapointed that Chris Thile decided to go that far. The music is great but I will not be buying the next Chris Thile album. There is plenty of music out there that does not require me to be guarded about who I play it around."
1,"Hey Thile, why the F-bomb?","I wasted my money. I was enjoying this until Thile found it necessary to drop an ""F-bomb"". One word ruined the entire album for me.A big fan greatly dissapointed!!!If clean lyrics are what you're looking for, look elsewhere."
3,Didn't work on my q6600 chip.,"Its a nice product, but it didn't work on my quad core 6600 chip. It ran at high all the time, and was anything but quiet."
2,CoolIt Eliminator,"Good product while it worked. The pump died within six months. I contacted the manufacturer CoolIt. I received a call back a week later. The Eliminator was discontinued. They offered an upgraded to a better bigger unit for $65.00. I agreed to upgrade and sen the one back via RMA. The new unit was nit shipped and I did not receive the RMA. I called three weeks ago and have not hear or received a call back. So far, I am no happy."
2,Nice but NOT true to size,Nice t-shirt but waaaayyyy smaller than I imagined. I like to wear t-shirts to bed so I ordered an XL and it fits more like a medium. Order a size or 2 larger...
1,Don't waste your money!,"Don't waste your money on this cheap table. The core was fiberboard with a thin 1/16th inch wood veneer. As I put the first table together, three of the 12 camlock fasteners broke, like they were made of pot metal. Those fasteners that didn't break actually cracked the veneer. After assembly, the legs and side boards had gaps. I'm a home inspector, and I know cheap when I see it. We sent all three tables back for a refund. If you want cheap, go to WalMart and get a better table. Made in China, and definitely looks like it."
5,My son loves this book!,"I've been on a mission to find a book that meets the following criteria for my 9 month old son:- Must be a board book (because he chews everything!)- Mustn't be too long (32 pages maximum because we're dealing with a short attention span here)- Mustn't be too big (so my son can easily pick up and play with the book)- Must contain photographs of familiar objects and other babies (because all of his other books only have illustrated pictures of animals for some reason!)""Happy Baby: Words"" fit all of the above criteria perfectly and my son loves it to death. He can actually turn the pages himself and he gets so excited seeing all the baby photographs inside.Great book!"
2,book reader,"The concept of course is great - pictures for babies to learn from. However, the photos themselves were not creative or really very pleasing to the mind. You can take a picture of a jacket and it is just a jacket - but you could spend a little of thought and make that jacket so appealing you would want to wear it. Vegetables are great for kids to learn, but you need to picture them in an appetizing way, not just a photograph of a piece of broccoli against a white background. I think a right brain person created this book - you need to turn on your left brain and be creative in your pictures."
5,Make your baby happy!,"Hands down this is one of my 8 month old's favorites. She will play with this book all day- flipping the pages back and forth- and smiling at the picutes- There are photos of toys, animals, colours, and baby faces. She just LOVES the babies in the book.Its the perfect size for her to handle by herself- and it stands up to drolling too! Great for long plane and car rides."
3,It's functional...,"As others have mentioned, the connector is terrible. It's incredibly loose, so the slightest tap and it will fall right out. Might make it not so great for use with a laptop. However, on my desktop nothing tends to touch it since it's around back, so it works. Picture quality is fine. I don't know what the one guy is talking about; I've watched plenty of movies and they look great, and subtitles are perfectly readable.This won't work so hot for use as a second monitor, though...since it's downgrading the video signal from S-Video to Composite, smaller text and fine graphical details aren't going to be clear. Even at S-Video quality you'd be lucky to make out most system text on normal font sizes...at Composite forget it.But as a way to pump out video (movies) to a TV, this is perfect...except for the loose connector."
5,Works like a charm,"One reviewer said the connection was so loose that the converter didn't work at all. Nothing could be further from the truth. The fit was snug and connecting was simple. It worked like a charm and took all of 15 minutes to install. I use it to connect my mac laptop to a run-of-the-mill TV to watch movies. Of course, text is unreadable, but graphics are excellent. It has no moving parts so I can't see where a problem could arise. Another reviewer said he had to 'shave a bit of the blue plastic' which I can see as a possibility, but I didn't even have to do that."
1,"Didn't fit, Didn't work either","It didn't fit in my s-video port. I tried to break off the plastic spacer in the middle bottom and trimmed off some of the rubber and it finally fit.And...it didn't work anyways. Claims to be bi-directional, I got black and purple stripes. My TV only has a coaxial and a svideo. Looks like i'm just keeping the VCR."
1,Cables to go s-vid adapter,The adapter works but image quality is poor between a dvd player and computer tv card.
3,Just what I needed,I have used this for two years now and it is fine. I have an issue with it fitting my ATI card but I don't know which is the problem. It does get the TV out that I wanted.
4,A great place to start learning Perl,"All the stuff you need in one box.OK ... the documentation is not so great, but the ease of installing Perl and all those Modules is well worth the price.The update feature is great ... especially if you have a higher than 28k connection.The module install is fabulous for the NON-UNIX GURU TYPE WHO SPENDS ALL DAY PLAYING WITH SEMANTICS. In other words it is for those who do not want or need to figure out how to install modules and make them work.I found the installation easy and straight forward.Yes, you could spend your lifetime searching and downloading modules and figuring out how to set them up ---- OR ---- you could buy this and get productive real quick.I give it a 4 star rating. Not bad for a first cut."
4,Worth it for the documentation on all the CPAN libraries,"This isn't a good set of books if you are just trying to learn Perl, but if you want to have documentation to most (if not all) of the CPAN libraries and how to use them, then this is for you. I found it very useful in that there are many routines already written that I had been writing myself. This is also useful if you don't have a fast internet connection and don't want to spend your life trying to download the latest stuff from CPAN. The only thing that I didn't have use for was the debugger that comes with the windows version, the debugger DDD that is freely available on the internet is a much better tool and works with virtually all languages."
3,whats going on with the roots,"this reminds me of commons electric circus or the new j5 record, a great group/artist putting out some experimental bulls*** with a few good cuts in-between, on the whole this cd is not the roots, its some experimental garbage they threw together and didn't think about, only tracks that sounded like the roots to me were:game theorydon't feel rightin the musicbabylong timeclock with no handscant stop this"
2,Not my favorite Roots album...,"I've been listening to the Roots for over 6 years now, and love most of the albums they've done since Things Fall Apart. I've had Game Theory in my possession for a month now, and still am not loving the songs."
2,average Album,"The roots are Talented&I liked the Tribute to the late J.Dila on the last track. but my knock always with them is a few things, they still don't write those tracks that are gonna be with you for years to come. now as instrumentalists they are versatile&Can play,but there biggest problem is being too technical in places. Black Thought is a decent MC,but lacks that knock out punch. as long as he has been a MC He still doesn't have that signature moment. the Afro dominates there whole being&nobody knows what they would be like without one person getting so much attention. good to hear Larry Gold's string arrangements on board."
2,Roots Still disappointing,besides the tribute to Dilla and the Game theory....this album sucks. makes for a great cup coaster
5,Lyrics,"""He said James, you better come out with your hands up-we got you surrounded-I'm in the back changin' my outfit-he said Blake, we gon' send the housing-I said WAIT-Here I come-Here I come-Here I come You boys get ready-Here I come. Black Thought needs to take over Hip Hop. Nas lost it, Jay is tryin' to become Mr. Knowles and the rest of these commercial cats need to get there diplomas. As 'Pac said ""They got the juice now!"""
5,the greatest story ever told,"This is the most innovative and sensational cd. When I listen I hear Malcolm X, Angela Davis, Nikki Giovanni, Hendrix, The Cure, Radiohead, Beck too many to mention.I would call this adult rap. Always staying true to who you are.There is so much to say about this prolific masterpiece. Listening to this somber but also at the same time energetic cd it feels like the 60's and 70's but also talks about today.It gives you the feeling of love/peace movement and at the same time it is quite radical. I see afros and lifted fists in the air and I also see Haightasbury San Francisco as well as the Delfonics and Stylistic sound. The amazing thing about this CD is that The Roots sound still prevails and without a doubt you know that it is them.The lyrical content makes you take pause and recognize the genius. If a single is released I think it should be Long Time hands down."
5,Alblum of the Year???????,"If this Alblum does not win alblum of the year, then there is more wrong with the industry then I suspect!"
1,weak,"weak sound tiny,you get what you pay for.Coby CX-CD377 Micro CD Stereo System with AM/FM Tuner with Digital Display and Line-in Input (Black)"
4,Nice CD player for the price.,"The player looks good and was easy to set up. The sound is a little tinny, but I think bigger speakers would help. A good product for the money."
3,Didn't last long.,"I actually got this as a Mary Kay prize from their Star program. I liked it at first, well, because I earned it!!! We put it in our daughter's room, she was an infant at the time. So we would play her lullaby music on it. The thing that we started doing, because it had this feature, was play the CD all night long, so maybe we did wear it out, but I've had plenty of stereos that lasted quite a few years with alot of play. This Coby one just died a couple of years later. The sound was pretty good, but I just wish it had a longer life. the look of it is cool and it was easy to see the buttons and know where they are in the dark, but it just stopped playing CD's after about 3 years."
3,its ok,"for how much i paid its good, sound quality is kinda off when i plug my phone/mp3/laptop into it, my old roomie had a GPX stereo which was in the same price range which sounded better @ higher volume, but once again for $30 shipped i can't really complain."
2,kind of fuzzy output,"I wasn't expecting a Bose quality or anything, I did assume that it would have more clarity than it does though. It suits my purpose at work, but if I had bought this for home it be getting returned, for sure."
2,"Cheap to buy, cheap product","I got this as a Christmas gift just to play Cd's because the AIWA I had for 13 years finally stopped playing CD's. Well, within a year this one started breaking down too. The CD's skip all the time. The screws in the back don't hold it very well. I've read other reviews about the hum when it's not playing...mine's no different. My daughter dropped the remote and it broke into pieces and now the infrared remote doesn't work at all. The warranty was not long enough for when it stopped working. I agree with others, play the extra money and get something that will last. I thought I could put this in my new baby's room for bedtime music and found myself getting up 2 or 3 times to stop it from skipping or turning it off all together. The Cd's I had in them worked fine in other players... Sorry Coby, not your best product...but you get what you pay for."
1,Disappointed,"Sorry, but this is not a good investment. Even at 40 bucks. Poorly designed and speakers are junk. Offer better speakers and adjust price downward, because fidelity is not good. Unit is just too big for what is does. In my view it has questionable electronics. Has a hum when nothing is coming out of it. May be a suspect power transformer...who knows?. It has an input for MP3, but no line out for perhaps better speakers. No headphone jack. Not very versatile. As far as I'm concerned, this is not a true microsystem. Has Limited capability. Pay the extra and get a SONY."
2,Disposable stereo,I bought two of these for teenager bedrooms. They worked for a very short time. The radios still work but the CD went jankity.
2,Was good for two years,I bought this unit as a gift for my Mom because she moved into a tiny apartment. It worked and sounded great for such a small stereo.It lasted for two years. The cd player will play a song then not have any sound or stop playing altogether. Radio works fine. You would think it would have lasted much longer.Never had a cd player do that in such a short time. I won't buy the same brand again.
3,"Not high-end, but does the job","This coby stereo has a really modern, slim look to it. I like how it doesn't take up too much space (although the speakers are a little bulkier than the main box). The sound quality is alright... what do you expect from a system that only costs about $40?? There are two things that I dislike about it. One is that the connection between the speakers and the main box is bare wire. This was annoying because I had to fiddle around with the wire until the sound came through, instead of just plugging it in like normal speakers. While setting it up, the wire actually broke on one connection, so I had to strip it down to get more surface so I could connect the speaker. It works fine now. I also don't like how there is no display showing the current volume level. On the other hand, the remote has a decent range of reception, and the aux port is good for attaching my mp3 player."
2,GOOD PRICE FOR WHAT YOU PAY FOR,IT WAS VERY CHEAP AND WHEN I GOT IT I FOUND OUT WHY. THE SPEAKERS WERE VERY LOW QUALITY AND THE PLAYER ITSELF WAS VERY FLIMSY.
1,Terrible,I would not recommend this product to anyone. It has terrible sound and sound quality. I bought it as a birthday gift and was very embarrassed by it. Save your money and buy a better product is my advice.
2,LOVE IT/HATE IT,Its wonderful sound for such a low cost stereo and its fun to watch but it breaks down easily.[within 1 year]Don't buy this item.
3,blown speaker,"It has now been months after my purchase and Coby has not shipped my replacement speaker after two phone calls and sending all the ""appropriate"" paperwork in. It is apparent that this company does not stand by its product. I will be advising all my friends not to buy this company's products."
4,Good cd player for small spaces,"I got this because I have a small room and no place other than my desk to put a stereo, so I wanted something small to play my cds. This works good, the speakers themselves are not of the best quality sound-wise but not atrocious. If you're looking for something to just listen to cds sometimes this is good, if you are looking for something where you can hear your music with great clarity, you have to spend more money than this but that goes for almost everything that's priced at a good value with electronics. I do recommend this, I use it almost daily and it looks great and doesn't take up lots of space."
3,It's worth what I paid for it,The player is nice to look at and I do like I can hook my ipod up to it with an aux cord. However the sound quality is poor. I also thought I would be able to hook it up to my bedroom tv for a surround sound style but there is no hook up to that. And my tv is louder than the stero anyway. Its nice for a small space and some quiet background noise.
1,Poor quality and stopped working,"We thought we had a good deal due to cost, but within a few months it became mostly useless. CD's stopped playing, radio stopped tuning...I would adjust the volume and the radio station would change! Overall it's a poorly constructed with I'm assuming are poor electronics. I won't buy Coby again."
4,Ok for kids.. Not for adults,I bought this or my daughter for Christmas. I must say it was well packaged and small enough for a shelf in her room. She loves it. it sets up quickly. the sound quality is good for her. It isn't the best but no worse than any other I guess. I was disapoointed that it doesn't have a headphone jack so we all have to listen to Justin Bieber. She loves it though. So far I would recommend it if you don't need the headphone jack :)
3,Died after 90 days,"I originally loved the sound and features for the price, but unfortunately it died after 90 days use. All precautions were taken (surge protector, etc.). Now in warranty claim phase. I'm not sure I'd buy another one, probably better off spending a little more on a brand that will last longer."
4,as a gift,I got this for my cousin (female) . It was easy for her to hook up & she said it works & sounds great!
1,I would give this ZERO stars if I could.,"I do have to state that I did not purchase the CD Player at Amazon.This CD player is AWFUL. I had it for only 3 weeks and the sensor broke. The CD skipped so, I tried to place a tape so the sensor would ""sense"" the CD but it did not work. The antenna for the radio function is cheap and useless."
1,The WORST.,"I have never had a positive experience with Coby products. I can honestly say without sarcasm that this stereo sounds so bad that I prefer silence. Music from this stereo sounds as if it's being played in a deep underground hole muffled by thick walls of cotton. And on top of that, after playing a total of four (4) CD's, it ceased to function at all.I will NOT recommend this item. Ever. Even one star is being generous."
4,CD Player,CD Player is perfect for the space in which we purchased it. I would definitely order a product similiar to this if needed!
1,Coby CX-CD377,"Okay... well I went to plug the wires in and the right side has a very loud buzzing noise in the speaker. Plugged in old speakers and it did the same so it wasn't the speaker, just a crap stereo in my oppinion. Mind as well just buy a portable cd-player. And I have to atleast rate this product with one star or I can't post the review but that star shouldn't even be there, it doesnt work!"
1,Worthless Waste of Money,The sound quality was TERRIBLE! It is cheaply made and would not play the CD all the way though. Thank goodness Amazon took it back with no problems. DO NOT BUY THIS! You will be disappointed.
1,Spend money on something better,"I bought this for my son to listen to CD's while he goes to sleep at night as he often gets scared and the CD's help him out. Well, the CD player broke in about a week. The remote barely works and the sound it puts out is flimsy at best. Also, the radio doesn't pick up stations that aren't broadcasting right across the street."
1,Waste of money,"This stereo was purchased as a gift for my husband. The first stereo came, and it did not work. The CD player never played a CD. I returned it for a replacement, and it work for a few months, then, it only worked when it felt like it. Now it does not work at all..."
2,Shipper forgot to ship remote control,"I was disappointed in the speaker sound, I was expecting a much better sound. I was very disappointed and not getting the remote control. WOW what a bummer!!! Can I get my remote please.Coby CXCD377 Mico CD Player Stereo System with AM/ FM Tuner (Black)"
2,break down,It is 10 watts each speaker. 4 ohms speakers. It doesnt have RCA cable output connections for amplifier. I bought 3. One works for 3 years and the other 2 burned up in 1 month. I am waiting for my 3rd replacement. I think I am going with another company if this one goes out.
2,Not great. Will replace soon!,Connection wires are so fine they break......CD's constantly skip.Not happy at all. Great for the garage.
2,Sad,"very Bad quality, does work good at all, i returned because the sound was awful at all, its weird because i have been using Coby for a long time, and never been like this one"
5,Great value,This mini disc system is ideal as a backup. It has excellent sound quality and volume.It was easy to operate after I realized that the paper guard had to be removed! I recommend it.
1,Don't bother,"I purchased this stereo against better judgement, thinking it was going in a 9-year olds room and would be temporary. I should have saved myself the hassle and spent a little more on a decent system. CD player will not work when unit is upright, have to lay flat to play. Worked that way for about 2 weeks, then quit playing CDs entirely. Don't make the mistake I did, spend a little more and get something that actually works, this is a piece of trash, just like previous reviews stated."
5,Better than I thought-- works for my toddler's room.,"I bought this stereo a little over a month ago. It's for my 19 month old daughter's room. It works perfectly for my needs. Even when turned off, the stereo emits a blue light that doesn't bother my daughter, but is a great little night light for me. It has a repeat button, and the remote works well too. I'm sure if you're really into music and an adult, the speakers might sound a little funky. The higher the volume is, the less quality the sound has. But for me, it completely meets my needs. I wanted a cheap little stereo to play soft to medium volume music for my daughter. It does just that."
2,A gift at a good price,"This was a gift for my disabled husband. I followed instructions to the T and when it was time to press the ON button, nothing happened. What a disappointment!It's nice-looking but, that's it. There are a gazillion Warranty papers in all different languages but, no information from Amazon on what to do with faulty products. I am tossing it because it is not worth the frustration and money and time to try and get satisfaction.On packaging, they just pulled the product box off the shelf and slapped on my address label and sent in in the US mail. What, Amazon, no size 4 boxes in stock?!!I would sooner buy a cd player from the local Girl Scout Cookies girl that to put myself and my husband thru this electronics frustration.Take note: THIS IS JUNK!"
1,Saddened,"I am so sad. I bought this as a valentines day gift for someone. It wont turn off. Even when it is turned off it still plays music. Talk about cheaply made. Thanks Colby, for nothing. And making me look as cheap as your product."
2,"Ups and Downs, but generally down","The book covers a wide range of topics with some decent, but out-dated examples. As a collective whole, this writing will get you thinking. However, some suggestions provided are impractical and simply not effective enough to warrant implementation. Providing pros and cons in the majority of examples provides some jewels of information and things to think about, but it does not live up to the massive amount of difficult, wordy reading involved or the overly verbose samples.I was able to take some things away from this book, but not nearly enough to warrant recommending it.Sorry guys, it's a dud."
2,culturally interresting but professionnally almost useless,"I could resume this book by...""don't code in Java, do it directly in C""..it remembers me when I was a young C programmer I read a book on performance in C the shortcut was ""Don't code in C do it directly in Assembler"".I really enjoyed this book for my programming general culture but for my professionnal day to day it seemed to me almost useless because I work on large J2EE projects.If I were building a high accessibility web site hosted on a pentium 100 with 8MB ram I would use these techniques but my clients have money and business requierements so I will just keep this book has a enlighment for my discussions with my programmers buddy."
1,Disappointing book !,A disappointing book. Not useful for large enterprise application development. No design/programming patterns are provided for optimization. I found only a few pages here and there useful and practical. Not worth buying.
1,Even the demo chapters have obvious errors,"I havn't actually bought this book, but I was doing a web search the other day for information on Soft and Weak References, and it just so happens that there is a sidebar in the online Chapter 4 that ""explains"" how they work which I found. Unfortunately the explanation of Reference objects is _completely_ wrong, the author obviously has no idea how Reference objects work. Given such a shoddy effort in this case, I certainly would doubt the accuracy of the rest of the book."
2,Very Disappointed,"I am very disappointed to find out that this book has only one page talking about JDBC and database related issue. Java has been used mostly in commerce applications whose performance is greatly depending on database design, JDBC, stored procedures, etc..."
5,Recommended,"The book ranges rather widely, covering a huge number of tuning details. The author seems to know hands-on performance tuning very well, and many of the examples were directly applicable to our own development. There is only one chapter on designing for performance (I would have liked more), but in that chapter he did identify precisely the issues that we encountered in our project. The example of double sorting internationalized text transferred directly to our project and speeded up a crucial area of our presentation. I do recommend this book, but do not expect a design book. This is strongly hands-on performance tuning."
4,NICE BOOK! IT EXPLORED EXTRA TERRITORIES.,"This updated edition of ""Java Performance Tuning"" shows remarkable improvement over its predecessor. In addition to improving its Java 1.4 details, this book journeyed into extra territories in its bid to leave nothing to speculation. Its users would appreciate the additional information it presented on JavaServer Pages, Servlets, Enterprise JavaBeans, Java Database Connectivity, and Java NIO.Although it provided detailed tuition on how to utilize various profiling tools in analyzing a program's characters, the main aim of this book is to furnish programmers (or developers) with all the information they would need when adopting tuning options.It ramified every factor which affects Java performance, and would serve as a handy reminder for both developers and administrators alike. I recommended it with all pleasure!"
5,"Excellent, Well Organized Reference","As a collector, this book has been extremely useful. It is well organized and informative. The patterns are listed alphabetically and the manufacturers are clearly labeled. The price lists have been in the ball park when used to haggle with on-line and local sellers. The info on reproductions has also been helpful. I would recommend this to anyone who is interested in Depression Glass."
4,Depression Glass,"A great book to reference to for names of patterns, companies who made the patterns and a value. A great book."
3,Pretty interesting book.,This book has info on every pattern but I wish it went into a little more depth per pattern. It has price lists per piece which is helpful when purchasing.
5,Great Product,I use self-stick notes often in the classroom. Especially when I need the students to remember important tasks.
3,Who's Dancin' Now?,Not as good as the first video - He Makes Me Feel Like Dancing - but an interesting follow-up.
3,Good speaker but....,The speaker has good sound but the first one I got was defective and the second one was missing accessories. Company help line was a long wait and no help. Fortunately amazon.com was great and replaced defective speaker. I still don't have accessories.
3,Not so hot,"I bought this at the same time as the AR 871. This speaker, however, has background noise, it crackles, and it not ""tuneable"" like the 871. Though this is supposed to be an indoor-outdoor speaker and more moveable, I still would not recommend it."
5,Most Excellent,I really enjoyed buying from this seller. I had no trouble with my order and would definitely continue my business with this seller
2,not so great,"This was for me an very difficult book to read. I found Helm's style alternately frustrating and tedious. Why does he use phrases like ""a motel where he had been storm-stayed one winter""? Affected, pretentious? Yes! Then Russ the ""hero"" and his mullings and musings and meanderings seemed alternately farcical and pathetic (full of pathos). He is almost an anti-hero, in that he has a great knack for getting things wrong. I found it hard to admire him or to relate to him in any way that made me want to continue to read the book. Ultimately i finished it beacuse it was a book club selection. If you enjoy this kind of thing, go for it, but I cannot say I did either."
2,Third Arm,"It is too hard to open and grab the blower. It can be useful if you just install and leave like that permanently, but not to travel as I needed."
1,Third Arm,I was very disappointed in this item. I was acutally hoping for the help of a third arm but it fails to be able to hold my dryer hose while it is turned on.
4,Working good,Everything is really good only problem is little bit strong and it makes little hard to use for ladies. other than really is working.
4,Works great but need strong grip,"This is a simple product and it does what it says it does. My biggest complaints is that, for a me, the clamps are very hard to squeeze open. Anyone with any hand strenght issues might not be able to open the clamps.The other thing is the little rubber tips on the end of the clamps fell off the first time I used them.Overall, a very good quality product. The product has been great for me."
2,Not really worth it,"I bought this to hold my force dryer while grooming my dogs. It doesn't really work, and I haven't been able to sucessfully use it yet and I've had it for about 2 months. It won't stay in place, the clamps just slide around on the counter. Maybe it would work better if you had a counter top that wasn't smooth. The clamps are really hard to get open, so getting the dryer tube inside the clamps is a 2 person job. On the bright side I can use the gooseneck piece to make a better device for this purpose."
3,Plastic clamp covers not very durable,"The arm works well, and the clamps have a nice strong grip. The plastic overs on the ends of the clamps are very flimsy though. After a couple of uses, they've started to disintegrate. But there's always duct tape.The lock washers that hold the clamps to the arm aren't the highest quality. You'll need a wrench to tighten the bolts regularly. Again, just a minor problem."
2,Hard to handle!,"The arm came as described and in a short time which was nice. However, I find that I'm not using it at all. Every time I put my hair blower on it to groom my dogs I end up taking it down because it's easier to just use my hand. I was really hoping to free up 1 hand. It keeps falling towards the table when my blower is in it."
1,Metro groomers third arm - broke on the first use,"I purchased third arm mainly so that I can put my dryer into the third arm to have my arms free to hold the cat and to comb the cat (totally what it is intended and designed to do).For me it was really hard to clamp the third arm to the counter top, I needed to use two arms, than I clamped the blow dryer to the top arm, but than when I had a wet cat ready to blow dry, I could not move the third arm, I tried to twist the top clamp lightly and it just fell off.Eventually I was able to screw it back on (after I blew dry my cat without third arm) but than on next blow dry the top clamp just flew off again off the rod, hitting on impact me, my cat and the mirror in front.Really useless if you use Metro dryer - the dryer is powerful and will blow with force enough to rip off the top clamp off the flexible rod.It is now sitting in the basement as a bulb holder I could do without."
5,Lotus Guide Review,"Entheogens and the Future of Religion (new edition)Edited by Robert ForteIn the same way that innocent people are often caught in the war on terrorism, entheogens have been the victim of the war on drugs. Entheogens are, for the most part, natural substances such as mushrooms, mescaline, psilocybin, and LSD. These substances have been used for centuries by shamans to reach into other dimensions and bring back valuable information for the survival of their groups. It's clear that civilization has been decoupled from nature and in the process we will pay a heavy price if we don't return to nature's wisdom. This book, first published in 1997, not only looks at the future of religion but possibly the future of human civilization itself if we ignore a valued communication between us and the underlying dimensions of nature.Rahasya Poe, Lotus Guide"
1,Didn't last long,"After about 10 charging cycles, will no longer hold a charge sufficient to power my digital camera. Waste of money."
1,Salad Blaster bombs.,"I wish I would have read the reviews prior to purchasing. I too was excited when I found this item! (I actually bought the tumbler, not the bowl) Finally, an easy way to bring salad to work for lunch without having to bring dressing separately. This product is poorly constructed. The very first time I used it, the top of the lid (that you press to release the dressing) split at the seam. The product is now unusable so I'm just out of luck. I've decided to wait and see if the design of the lid improves (which I truly hope it does) because the concept is really great!Salad Blaster Bowl"
3,Salad blaster,"I agree that the dressing container lid splits, although I have found that the ones on the salad blaster bowls are much sturdier than the salad blaster in the shaker style.Its a great way to carry salads to and from work."
2,Missing parts,"I didn't get around to trying to install the radio until this month, only to find that this product was missing a lot of parts, and also had a manual that didn't have instructions for the specific pack listed. I didn't bother contacting the seller because it's already been about three months, but definitely CHECK when you get it to make sure EVERYTHING is there. Out of all of the pieces, I only received two."
1,Missing Manual!,"I recieved this product, and complained at once about the missing manual. They said they would send a new copy and never did!Do not trust them!!!"
1,inaccurate and chilly,"oman is the most exciting place i haveever been. after reading the lonely planet versionof Oman i was left with NO IMPRESSION.I arrived to find it exciting, stunning andfull of activities. The books prices for hotels andtaxis, juice etc were ALL WAY OFF. All too high.For instance a fresh made juice in front of youcost one hundred omani basas...a coke one hundred basaa dinner one riyala hotel varied.a taxi ride 200 basa for a few kilometers..and the book gave no feeling or emotion to thecountry at all... i browse thru it, and after arriving never openned it again. in fact i left it behind in oman as ifound it to be a heavy wieght with no signifigance.perhaps the AUTHOR was fearful of Muslim countries and didnot like Omanis...too bad. I will never buy lonley planetproducts again..."
5,Beastly (in the good way),"This is a awsome video editing program.\Very stable, never crashes, and i'v had it for a while.Its got tons of features and it will take a while to learn all of them, but you can make basic videos by the 2nd day. It reguires a hefty computer, i have a P4 @ 2.4 gigahertz, a lighting fast motherboard, 700 something ram and the program is still asking for more. Dont get me mistaken, it still runs fine, just to get the very very best performance you will need like to gigs of Ram and a 3.2 ghz processor."
2,It was broken.,I ordered 2 of these balls for my cats and when I received the order one of the balls did not work.
3,Late Night Misfire,"When I purchased this, I was looking forward to hearing the mix that Nigel Pierce had put together. Was it that late in the night when this was laid down? The mixing is awful and the sequencing is also very poor in places. I would hardly call crossfading 2 seconds before the end of each track mixing!!!!! That aside, the track selection is good and this CD does well to create the late night post club mood. However, if looking for a good mix chill-out CD, try ""Solar Spectrums"" by Chris Coco or ""Cam del Mar"" by Rob da Bank."
3,Would like it more if it was unscented,"The convenient tube is nice, but it's scent is too strong--especially for a product that is used right under ones nose."
3,Father's Moustache Wax,"the product was everything it stated, it holds well and smells good but for the price it is a very small tube. Somehow I missed this when I was reading the other reviews of products. I thoght I was getting an ounce and it is 1/8th of an ounce. Other than that issue it is a good product."
3,Not bad for a touch up,If you are going to buy this I suggest that you keep in mind that its only for a touch up during the day . I'm not a fan of it since I have no time to look in the Mirror apply and comb .
3,Father's Moustache Wax,"Recieved the neutral shade, works well but took another post's advice on using hair drier to help hide the ""white spots"" after applying (which is great when at home). Good product, not a strong smell under the nose."
3,Fathers Moustashe Wax,"Well the fragrance was a big turn-off, the behavior of the little stick was OK to Good?The price & the odor are a big enough turnoff that I will not be making another purchase of this brand!"
3,"Good hold, easy delivery, questionable fragrance","The hold on this wax is pretty good, great for touch-ups. I was a bit worried that using the stick would pull too much on the hairs, but it's not that bad actually. As with others, I'm not huge on the fragrance. Maybe if they'd kick it down a notch so there's just a hint of it. I only use this stuff on the ends as right under the nose is too overbearing. I made the mistake of putting this on when I had a hangover...not a good idea. However, my girlfriend loves the smell, so there's a definite upside ;)"
2,nasty smell,"The wax works well. I like the tube application, its like putting on chapstick. The smell is terrible. It smells like pouporri. If not for the smell id be fine with it. I can smell it the whole day. My next wax will be unscented."
2,Overrated,"I had high expectations for this product but when I finally tried it, I was dissappointed. It doesn't perform nearly as well as Clubman."
5,Wax to the max,"This stuff is very easy to use and works well. It holds for about 8 hours until it needs another coat. The packaging was hilarious it really made the product worth the buy. I was all set to ""groom my bloom"" when it showed up at my door."
5,"Wow, this really is that good!","I've been using the Clubman wax, and Father's is superior in every concievable way:APPLICATION: I wasn't sold on the chapstick-style applicator, but compared to the metal tube and cheap plastic brush, Father's is easy to apply, and even easier to carry!SMELL: The mildly sweet beeswax smell of the Father's product is actually pleasant--all the more so compared to the acrid, almost-metallic odor of ClubmanCOLOR: The natural wax color fades almost instantly into my stache. The white goo of the other product makes my black hair look greyCONSISTENCY: Father's rubs easily into my hair, and distributes evenly, whereas the other tends to clump.HOLD: Works great to put stubborn hairs back into place. I think the application technique (rubbing the stick straight on the hair) helps in this regard.The only negative? It's not sold by Amazon, so the shipping is artificially high. I figure I'll just buy several at a time, to offset the shipping cost.I love this product!"
1,Ugh the smell,This wax is perfect in every way...except for the smell. It has a sandalwood/patchouli aroma that is nauseating to me. Back to the drawing board to find my husband a good mustache wax.
3,Girls loved it,This compared to the Tracy Anderson Mat DVD I bought on the same day arrived so quickly for a vacation with my 2 3 and 5 year old neices. It was so funny to watch them do the dances and they wanted to do it over and over every day. I only thought the video's quality and music sounded like it was very old as if it were created over 10 years ago but the girls didn't care.
5,"An Animal Rights ""Must Read.""","With poignant clarity Dunayer illustrates how speciesist ideology permeates what was once thought of as the animal rights movement. Defining speciesism as ""a failure, in attitude or practice, to accord any nonhuman being equal consideration and respect"", Dunayer exposes the underlying speciesist premises of many current animal welfare campaigns masquerading as real animal rights. ""Animal Equality"", Dunayer's first book, establishes her as the spokesperson for the abolitionist animal rights movement. She solidifies this position in ""Speceisism"".If you truly believe you are Animal Rights; If you are unsure of your position on animal rights vs. animal welfare; If you are not sure if you really understand the difference, or even sure of the real meaning of speciesism, I urge you to read this book, as IMNERHO, it is nearly as an important work to the animal rights movement as ""Animal Equality"" itself."
2,agree that it is oversimplified,"Dunayer really does oversimplify the views of other people. She also seems to take single sentences from other academics (notably Tom Regan), and picks them apart out of context.It was really irritating to read ""Speciesism""- she's just another academic who seems hell-bent on proving her theories are ""better"" and everyone else is speciesist. I appreciate that she has a critical mind, but I think she could be a lot more productive with it."
2,Simplistic and Silly,"Dunayer's views on speciesist language are sometimes interesting, such as her observation that an aquarium should be regarded as an ""aquaprison."" But they are sometimes downright silly. For example, she maintains that we are ""speciesist"" if we use the term ""animal rights."" We have to say ""nonhuman rights."" We can properly use ""animal rights"" only when we refer to human rights as well as nonhuman rights. That is the sort of thing that gives political correctness a bad name. Moreover, Dunayer's discussions of Tom Regan, Gary Francione, Peter Singer and others are terribly simplistic and often just wrong."
3,Collection of early demos and some cover tunes!!,"Check out Junkyard's new CD featuring all 14 song demos recorded to get them signed to the Geffen label back in 1987 plus 5 great cover tunes.

5,"Finally, a book that concentrates on apartments!","Having recently purchased my apartment, I was at a standstill with my space. After reading this book, I became determined to meet this man and get him in my home for a personal consultation. After 5 months, and my luck, I was able to get him into my home. He has turned my apartment from an asthetically difficult space into a very harmonious one. With Feng Shui you can just rearrange your present furniture to achieve this harmony. It's amazing how easy the use of Feng Shui is. This is a great book for anyone that has a small space or an apartment!"
4,"Great book, but not for feng shui beginners","This is a beautifully written and photographed book, but it is not a primer for feng shui novices. I have studied feng shui for many years and got some good information from this, but it really doesn't address the basics that someone just learning would need (for that, try ""Move Your Stuff, Change Your Life"" by Karen Rauch Carter - superb book!).The homes in ""Feng Shui Revealed"" are gorgeous and beautifully decorated, not exactly ""How to improve your suburban tract house"". For anyone who loves architecture, design, and has a good foundation in the fundamentals of feng shui, this book is a delight."
5,The BEST balance of Enslaved.,"Hmmm at first this cd could be a strange one 'cause it has some experimental elements but with time you'll realize that it doesn'e affect the music anyway, it's still Enslaved with great clean vocals and lots of HEAVY guitar riffs. some werdness at times mas overall it's just genious brutallity, Enslaved has done the work pretty much well this time, it's not all that viking as ELD and FROST but it's stil has the feeling of it, great lirycs and everything.If you enjoy extreme viking metal you should try the band VIKING CROWN , another great and VERY brutal ''viking'' act."
5,Every bit as good as their previous material,"These guys continue to put out one great album after another. This one is slower, and more vocal driven than their previous efforts. They are more melodic and slower here, with less keyboard-driven songs chock full of pop hooks. It isn't any less good, just a little different.These guys are such talented musicians, just about any direction they go is going to be great, and this is their latest example. And the best bands always evolve. I just hope they continue to put out such quality material, which is the way I felt after listening to their previous two CD's."
4,Great Album!,"I had never heard the new pornographers before this album... a friend brought it along for a road trip... and I am hooked! The sound is simple, so it takes some time to grow on you... but before you know it you could listen all day!If you like indy pop... you will love this bands cleaver lyrics and catchy tunes!Justin"
4,Great new album,"I have slowly gotten into New Pornographers as they've put out more albums, and I must say that I found this album to be much more rewarding and much more immediate than the preceding material. Each of these songs are a roller coaster of emotion and a joy to be along for the ride. I love the more organic feel of this album, adding the harmonica and some violins on tracks. I think that it really gives the album a polished sound (though not overtly like a boy band) and gives the album a mature and delicate sound that almost signals that they've gotten to where they were going. My favorite tracks are....well, all of them. Unguided has a soft spot in my heart- I just can't get enough of the bridge in the middle.While I love Twin Cinema, my one complaint is that it doesn't end very well. This, however, does with Importance of Solitude and Spirit of Giving. I can hear these wrapping up live shows for years into the future.Great listen, very enjoyable. Highly recommended."
4,Give it at least 3 listens before making a judgment.,"At after my first two listens, I was intrigued, but not overly impressed. But after about 4 listens, this cd really grew on me. It may be my favorite NP cd. There's just a couple songs that do nothing for me, about 90% of the songs are excellent."
4,Great music,Someone turned me onto this band and I really enjoy this. The female vocalist in this band have a great voice and I especially like those songs where they sing lead.
2,"I just didn't get it.........recomend the new Poi Dog Pondering ""7"" CD","Too be honest....I just don't get it....a blend of numerous influences and styles, but they just never seem to quite blend...hard to describe and it's a worthwile listen....however if you want to hear a band blend various influences from Jam, to Jazz, to Grunge, to Americana Folk...check out the '7' CD from Poi Dog Pondering......truly amazing"
2,Disappointing,"I bought this after the good review in the Washington Post a few weeks ago, and think I will give it away. I also bought ""Under the Blacklight"" also reviewed at the same time in the Washington Post; this was much better to my taste."
4,Highly enjoyable...,"I haven't been a New Pornographers fan for too long so I bought this kind of on a whim. I figured it would be a good album to have for my trip back home for the holidays and it turned out to be way more than I expected. Every song is enjoyable, especially after more and more listens. 'My Rights Verses Yours' is a great way to begin the album, which also consists of very moving tracks like 'Challengers.' It's not an album that exactly changed my life, though it could have, possibly, under the right circumstances."
3,The executive edition is worth it!,"If you're new to the new pornographers, you might like this album. However if you're a fan from previous album, you might want to spend the extra few bucks for the executive edition. It has a lot of bonus material, much of which is better than the stuff on the album proper. Heck, the Lite mix of ""Go places"" is worth the extra cost alone."
3,Challengers Doesn't Quite Deliver,"TNP has never failed to produce a solid album, and Challengers is no exception. The problem with Challengers isn't in weak vocals, instrumentals, or lyrics. The problem is simply that the album is hum-drum, starting with a few steady (dare I say repetitive?) songs and flatlining as the album progresses. A few songs are catchy, at best, but all pale in comparison to songs from previous albums, like ""Sing Me Spanish Techno"", ""The Laws Have Changed"", and ""Mass Romantic"". A ""nice"" album which makes me want to take out a defibrillator to inject a little life into a fairly bland CD. We know you can do better."
2,Whats up with the whiney dude?,Twin cinemas was a good outing. This is mostly boring. What I could never understand about NPs is why they have the annoying guy sing when they have Neko??? The guy belongs on the Rocky Horror soundtrack. His nasal whine and affectations can be excrutiating. Myriad Harbor may be one of the worst songs in history. I stick with the NPs cause they are different but this one may be their worst.
4,Amazing stuph,"How the NPs keep cranking out these pop gems is beyond me. Great hooks, great music, and an overall fine effort."
2,Not the book for me,"I'm a complete novice when it comes to graphic design tools but I am an IT professional and I must say I found this book very heavy going and didn't help me get to grips with Photoshop. I searched the web today and found a free tutorial site which explains a lot of the functions I need and enabled me for the first time to do ""simple"" things like feathering, merging two images etc. The book has too much text and is very off putting to the beginner. I'm sure the information is in there somewhere but to me it's a chore to find it. I bought the book on the basis of some of the other reviews here and really had high hopes. Unfortunately, it will now be consigned to the bottom drawer and I will use the website I found to learn Photoshop instead."
4,Not bad at all,"Exciting in parts, in this book the vampires don't suck blood but life force. Our hero can weave dreams for his donors or like his brother, they have the power to steal life force and therefore kill.They can't turn mortal until or if they fall in love, the book is long but not boring. It does seem to have little highlights of story and tumbles to the end. Being a romance, the guy gets the girl.The characters are not really fleshed out and the reader remains detached which was a little disappointing. 7/10"
4,A very pleasant read,"This was my first book of Ms. Krinard's, and I plan on keeping it! The storyline is good with Nicholas being more of an incubus than a vampire, but still, the idea that someone can enter your dreams and take nourishment off your ""pleasure"" is very intriguing. I have read one of her other books, loved it, and am now in the process of collecting her others. I can't wait to continue reading all her other books."
3,"It's okay, but not GREAT","I liked this book, but it wasn't her best. Over all I would recommend her books anyway, she's a wonderful writer."
2,Not so good,"Hmmm...ok. This story left me a...well, a little cold. I liked the interesting twist on the classic vampire theme. But I found the heroine more irritating than endearing and the hero's obsession with his immortality rather annoying. Perhaps that sounds overly critical, and perhaps the story really wouldn't work without the constant self-recriminations, but I still found him annoying enough to want to slap him. And her. Perhaps I was in the wrong frame of mind when I read it.I have nothing against this author. I really enjoyed a couple of her werewolf books that I read,Touch of the Wolf (Historical Werewolf Series, Book 1)&Secret of the Wolf (Historical Werewolf Series, Book 3).....Apparently, vampires are really not my thing....This story contains graphic love scenes."
1,Prince of Dreams,I found this tedious and very frustrating. Difficult to know which is real and which is a dream. Totally confusing.
4,"Taming the ""paperfull office""","I found ""Network Printing"" to be a fine example of taking documentation from at least half-a-dozen sources and tying it all together with a coherent theme: providing network print services to customers using (fill-in-the-blank) systems. Six years ago, when I was managing four Unix systems for 100 customers who wanted to print their reports on any of a dozen printers (some Ethernet, some Ethernet-to-serial), this book would have been a godsend. I especially enjoyed the description of the history of printing: it put into context a lot of things I just accepted without further thought. Anyone in the above situation, or even someone who would like to reliably set up print services, from either the client or server perspective, would be wise to get this book."
3,Two flaws but the rest is decent,"The BSD type printing systems were discussed head to toe but the System V printing systems were referenced sparingly. Because of this, many Solaris and SGI users will have to read beyond the BSD parts to interpret the concepts. I was also surprised that there was no information on CUPS, while some Linux operating systems use it as their primary printing system. If you look past these two points, the book is a fine reference for all UNIX administrators. There is a definitely a distinct demand for these types of books."

2,Buy separately,Again the idiocy of more expensive full set DVDs. You can buy separate 5 seasons for $50 less on Amazon.
1,wrong sensor,The picture is incorrect. the sensor displayed goes in the manifold what I received went in the exhaust pipe. I used it and it worked fine but I had to buy another sensor
1,"Floodsafe connector not ""floodsafe""",I wanted to make sure that this device would work as advertised and so I conducted several tests with varying water pressures and water flow rates and I could not get this device to activate it's safety valve. It seems this is a common theme with this product. I did contact Watts and they suggested that the valve is defective and return where purchased. I definately would not trust this valve to protect flooding if there was a failed hose or connector on my refrigerator.
1,Do not BUY this product.,"This product is dangerous, contaminates the water system, from the very beginning of installation the water and ice are not fit for human consumption. Metallic particles leach from the hose into potable water system, contaminating ice and filter water systems to the point of clogging the lines and complete failure of potable water system on the refrigerator."
4,A basic tool for development economics,"Together with his more recent Institutions, Institutional Change and Economic Performance (1990), D.C.North provides here an indispensable framework to reflect on the problems of social transformation that underlie economic growth and development. He proffers no magic wand, but he describes the long processes implied in institution building which no development theoretician or practitioner should ever ignore."
5,A Needed Addition to the Literature,"For anyone who has done free-for-all knife fighting, even in training with rubber knives, the static techniques taught in the classic martial arts become useless fast.This book tells you all you need to know to survive and carefully deconstructs the flawed, and even dangerous, techniques taught in dojos everywhere. It then tells you what you need to be doing in the real world. Many self-defense books advertise this ""real world"" approach, but ""Put 'em Down"" actually delivers.It's short but packed with information. Not a word wasted."
4,Short but good!!,"OK,so this is a short book and a little pricey....but the info presented is excellent. For those of you familiar with the Applegate method,stance,etc this will round out your knowledge and give you a simple ""game plan."" The author takes a pragmatic approach to this subject and I was particularly impressed with his section on ""grips""...several high profile instructors share or have come around to his point of view. This is book for someone who wants solid/practical info on technique but who does not want to devote half his life trying to master a martial art."
4,A Good Beginning to Your Knife Fighting Training,"I was skeptical about how much information would come from so few pages. To my surprise, I liked it. The book gives you a no nonsense approach that can be integrated in your current training. Definitely worth being in your library!!"
2,what a crock!,"It's good to see someone who's been paroled be productive.Don't waste your time on what is basically a pamplet by a guy trying to sell books by offering ""jailhouse knifefighting"" techniques.Even his grip is all wrong-if you stabbed someone with his preferred grip there's a good chance of losing some of your own fingers.Let's face it:if he really knew from experience what works in jail he'd still be inside.There is no technique to the knife/dirk/edge in jail;all that is required is the will to attack.Anyone should know that about 95% of knife fighting in jail is basically coming up and sticking someone in the back(repeatedly if possible).Pentecost even has the nerve to ""debunk"" other types of knife fighting.If it comes down to knife fighting either run,pick up something as the equalizer,or carry a gun.If you want a better book on knife fighting get ""Sevillian Steel"" by James Loriega."
1,It stinks!,This book stinks. All he talks about is how tough he is and how little martial artists know about knife fighting. Perhaps this self-proclaimed expert could try explaining a little about knife fighting tactics and strategies rather than bragging about how many knife fights he'd survive.
3,Not as bad as I thought,"I loved The Shape of Things. I was completely engaged the entire play, and was completely surprised by the ending."
5,review,This has got to be one of the most well written plays I have read. Everything is well thought out and the story line is so unique. There is a twist at the end that will make you want to scream!
3,Not his best...,"...but it has some great scenes. If you love Labute's messed-up characters, Evelyn is not one to be missed!"
3,The shape of things review,"Well this book was very... different? It definitly wasn't like anything I've ever read before. It holds deeper meanings in a more ""modern"" twisted way I guess. I don't know If I would buy this if I didn't have to but it would definitly catch my attention in a book store or something"
2,Not as clever as it tries to be,"This play attempts to make the audience think about the meaning of art and life, but in the end one feels that certain characters are simply cold and that the point is lost in a silly dynamic. Rather than use a more subtle method, the play's major themes are quite literally speeled out near the end. Rather than allow for self-examination or reflection, the audience instead is boxed into one of a few simplisitic mindsets. It would have been better if the play asked the same quesions in a less cheesy, final reveal format and instead tried to analyze the real inner-workings of human interaction, relationships, and friendships. Rather than being deep, it comes off as trite and maudlin. Topped with awkward dialouge, this play is neither entertaining nor intelecutally stimulating."
1,"Ugh...bad sound, bad samples","I know what you're thinking: I could use some spare beats and pieces for my next track. And what a price! All I have ot do is plug up my sampler to my CD player and I'm MONEY!Well, you get what you pay for, and I want you to take a look at that price one more time. I've gotten sample CDs that had about as many tracks as this for at least double the price, and for fair reason: this one is horrid. The beats are dated and lame for the most part, and they sound as if they've been recorded on a tape player, then burned to CD. There's tape hiss or air or something going on with each track. You couldn't sample it if you wanted to!Not to mention that some of the stuff is decidedly UNroyalty free as far as I'm concerned: there were at least 2 recognizable riffs that would get you put in court in 5 minutes if you used them on a project. What if the ones I didn't recognize were unroyalty-free as well? Ugh.Bad, bad purchase all around."
5,Mrs. Wilkes Boardinghouse Cookbook,Love this cookbook. We were recently in Savannah and had the pleasure of eating lunch at Mrs. Wilkes Boardinghouse. Many of the 10 dishes that were on the lunch table are in the book and I am delighted to be able to bring them to my home.
3,NOT REALLY A COOK BOOK,"IF YOU LIKE MRS. WILKES' BOARDING HOUSE, WHICH IS AN EXPERIENCE IN EATING GOOD HOMECOOKING, YOU'LL LIKE THIS BOOK FILLED WITH REMINICENCES BUT A 'COOKBOOK' IT ISN'T."
1,Eve of Destruction,This is NOT the excellent Gregory Hines movie of the same title! A previous reviewer is misleading readers into believing it is! This is a horrible movie that has poor acting and unintentionally funny fight scenes.
2,"No Sir, I didn't like this book one bit!","I bought this book hoping to learn more about compositing techniques and instead had to skim throught all the explanations of how to use Digital Fusion. If you don't use Digital Fusion don't bother with this book. Literally half of the book has tutorials that read more like a software step by step than an actual overview of compositing. I usually don't like to write negative reviews, but I really don't like spending money on a poor product. Sorry."
2,There's a lot of wasted paper here,"I can't say the book doesn't have any useful information within its pages, because it does have some. But considering its size, it doesn't have much. The author could have written 2 seperate books, one on compositing, and one on Digital Fusion, and still used less paper. At one point, he spends 15 pages showing the reader how to preform a simple time-stretching feature on every piece of compositing software. Then he uses 15 pages to show you how to reverse footage for every piece of compositing software. I found the book very frustrating to try to read from cover to cover. He also tells you constantly to refer to the manuals of programs that are not Digital Fusion. I wouldn't describe the coverage of Digital Fusion are truely 'in depth' either. But someone who uses Digital Fusion would get more out of the book than I did.This book could have been much better, I'm surprised so many people actually like it."
2,"oh good, more old stuff","Why stop at Lee Stranahan? Why not have doug Kelly review it too? That should bump the # of stars up more.Like others I agree that this is a digital fusion book. There is way too much space taken up with ""get another compositing package"" there is page after page of listing what each comp package can't do.What really killed me was I saw stuff in there from Doug's other books. Let pad out the books with old stuff there Doug. We didn't see enough of that lamp composite in the others.I would have to say Ron's book is better."
4,has it all,"hi,I teach compositing(after effects,combustion,flame).I read this book a few years back when i was just starting out and refer it as a MUST READ to all my students.I wish the author had followed up after this book...woder why he did not :( .this book is a bit dated but has all the theory and practise you'll eve need.Actually it'll be more than what you need if youre just starting out.4 stars cause no one or nuthing is perfect.thanks kelly.b"
2,Anyone Can Dance Swing,Anyone Can Dance Swing by Dance Mania is a waste of money. The music CD is useless (too fast) and the lessons are average. The lessons are irritating by the inclusion of detailed ball-toe instructions.Advice: find another DVD or go to dance class
5,The indispensable Photoshop book,"Ring the bells! At last, a book that fully explains the secrets behind each dialog and command. No fluff, no B.S., just in-depth, straight-to-the-point info I can easily read and understand. The explanations of errors and pitfalls definitely stand out. This most excellent tome has already saved me untold time and money. O'Quinn's the man! O'Reilly rocks! Calloo! Callay!"
2,Not Recommended,"I personally don't like this approach where it simply goes through and tells you this button does this, this picture means this.. blah boring to read but if you want the book just as a reference if you often forget what something does, and dont want to do trial and error (best way to learn) then get the book.. I will proubaly never buy another in a nut shell book, unless its for a programming language because then you often need to look up commands.. Everything you need to learn about photoshop is on the web just do some searching."
2,"Yawn, zzzzzzzzz","I had high hopes for this volume -- based on the Amazon reviews. I read the first 30 pages, and then did some browsing. I'm sorry to report that this is the dullest sort of survey course.Over the past 40 years, I've purchased, read, and continue to read, a good bit of philosophy writing, for an amateur. And this is the first book I've ever returned to Amazon. Not even an amateur would consider this philosophy writing."
4,Excellent Book,"I got this book for my daughter after she learned a little balloon making in camp. She loves it and is able to make the shapes with no adult help. There are some very cute balloon ideas in this book. My daughter says, ""I'm nine years old and I think if you know a few twists, you'll love it. Most things are easy to make and a lot of fun if you like doing balloons. I hope you try it."""
3,Very nice book.,I've got 4 books already and this one has designs that they don't. So if your looking for something new to make this one is good source for that. The directions are easy to follow and the pictures are understandable. Several of the images you can't tell what they are unless you draw faces on them. I even played what's this with my family and they didn't know what it was then I made eyes and smile and they all said it right away!It also has other things besides just animal balloons. Like things to do with apple balloons and making balloon hats. Also several games you can play with balloons.All together I like it cause it's got designs that I didn't have before.
2,You must have some experience,This book is contain many form of animals with one 260 Q balloon. It's a good book but you must have some experience to twist with it. This book is not in colour pages. Your customer will like it but you must do some joke while you twist any.
4,Balloon Sculpting a Fun and Easy Guide to Making Balloon Ani,This was a pretty good book on how to make balloons but some of the animals are difficult to create.
5,A book that takes you from the basics to the the indepth !!!,"This book gives you every tool you need to get yourself through the rough edges, yet get the most from the Operating System! I love it and its tools!!!"
3,Not quite as funny as I remembered...,"... time being the great equalizer. However, at the time this came out it was a slapstick poke at all things science fiction and star trek/star wars directed.It's dated, it's corny, but some ideas were actually rather advanced. The idea of a vegetable as a crew member (think Farscape's Zan) was weird at the time, but with time, became an interesting concept to explore.I loved the clone connundrum for Quark. I think that is the most memorable part I retained over the years. Still funny.If you like Mel Brooks' kind of humour, this just may appeal to you."
2,Funny thing about memory......,"I was pretty excited to hear this was coming out on dvd. I remember when this show first came out, and my brother and I in our early teens really enjoyed it and looked forward to it every week. We were completely bummed when it got cancelled after 8 episodes. And now....30 years or so later, it's back!!! And you what? It's borderline dreadful! I've watched the first 4 episodes and do not have the stomach to watch anymore. If you want to buy this for nostaligia reasons, do it but expect to be disappointed. It's just not remotely funny and while it may have been original at the time, it's one big cliche today. And the Jean/Gene thing is downright offensive."
3,OUTDATED,"Probably cutting edge when it was first released but a little too silly for modern viewing. We got bored and did not finish the series. Perhaps it got better but we will never know. If We had not seen ""Tripping the Rift"" first, we may have appreciated it more."
1,Quark,Extremely dated humor and story plots. Recommended to die hard oldie TV series collectors only.
2,Pobre.,Segunda parte que al igual que la primera no aporta mas que un desenlace sorpresa al final del ultimo capitulo. No la recomiendo.
2,Beware - not the same game as the newer Dogz,"I purchased this game for my daugter for Christmas. It ended up being a big dissapointment. Why? I purchased ""Dogz"" for her sister. Both are packaged identically and appear to be the same game - except one has a pet dog and the other a pet cat. In truth, Catz is nowhere near the game that Dogz is. I can't beleive that this game is priced the same as Dogz - they are extremely different.Gameplay in Catz in comparatively boring and not engaging as Dogz. In Catz, you watch your cat and interact with it on screen. In Dogz, you are a little child (you pick a boy or girl) that moves around a rich environment and interacts with a family, etc while taking care of a dog - tons more to do!If you alread have Dogz and are considering Catz, don't bother. If you are choosing between Dogz and Catz - well - you know which one to choose."
1,What a waste!,"I puchased Dogz for my son and I enjoy playing the game. But I love cats, so I fiqure I would purchase the Catz game, which was a no no.Very boring, waste of time. Please don't waste your money, I think I only played Catz twice and put it on the shelf and haven't played it since."
5,Road Trip,My parents got me catz and purr pals for me since we are driving on road trips alot this summer. I tried playing both games but found that catz was way funner. I really dont like purr pals all that much. Catz is fun cause it gives me something to do on the boring drives.
2,"Cute, but","This was a good intro game for my daughter, but after playing with this myself - we will grow bored soon."
1,Why is this a game?!,"It is so boring! Your cat just sits around all day long and you can hardly interact with it! Wow, the box looks great, but don't be fooled! The graphics are almost 2D, unlike the box shows! Even if you love cats and don't like dogs in the least bit, Nintendogs is the way to go with taking care of pets!"
3,exactly what I hoped for!,"I bought this game as something I(23y/o) could play with my sister(3y/o). She loves it and after playing with her chosen kitten for a few minutes was begging to play it time and again.It's perfect for keeping her attention. She can dress the kitten up, and take care of it all by herself.She did need me to tell her what the buttons do but I expected as much since she can't read yet!Great game and should hold her interest for awhile and I'm finding myself wanting to play with the kitty as often as possible!Only thing I'm having trouble with is getting the litter box clean!"
4,"Good, but not quite what I was expecting","Easy to read -- I'm probably going to pass this along to family members so they can get a better idea of what I'm experiencing as a person who suffers from Bipolar disorder. This book was quite what I was expecting, so was a bit disappointing from that standpoint, but I think it explains a great deal about bipolar disorder and different aspects of the illness in a very readable format."
4,"Good, complete, but dry and missing a few things...","I liked the book. It was informative, but it was dry and at times difficult to read. Good to learn from, but presented more in the outline format and not as enjoyable as most books."
1,Disappointed,"This book contains a lot of ""stereotypical"" ideas about mental illness. The author mentions his surprise that moods are not triggered by ""monthly cycles"". I found the book offensive to women and did not find it helpful. Many times through the book the author mentions how ""dangerous"" patients in a mania can be. The reality is that sadly, most patients who are manic commit suicide, not homicide. I was offended by the fact that it was all too obvious that this doctor who wrote the book probably treats his patients in the same way."
5,Good value,This bed is an excellent value for the cost. Please realize that it comes disassembled in a long narrow box. It took my husband a couple of hours to assemble it. The rustic look is perfect for a cabin.
5,Tight NW Cuts!!,"BUKM is the tightest of NW Cuts!! Reppin P-Town (Portland, ORE). My name is Jase, Im originally from Boston, MA. Moved with my Cousin Jonathan Buck (Vibezelect Cafe) to Pasadena, CA. I now reside in Portland ORE with some family and came across Uneek from BUKM himself!! Uneek Introduced me to BUKM and the Ghetto Rise Records Label at a gathering with some freinds.. I recommend this CD to ANYONE who likes R&B, HIP-HOP, or some music to just straight chill to. These cuts are off the hook, hip-hop and rap has a mello side!!"
5,Neurosurgery Support Recommended by Someone Who Had It,"Suzy Becker's book was recommended to me by another surgery patient, and it helped me understand what would happen to me when I had brain surgery. It should be required reading for anyone with epilepsy and/or anyone facing treatment of this type. I am pleased to report that I returned to work much sooner than expected and I believe her book, and the things I read in it, helped inspire me to keep a positive attitude. It helped my family cope, too. She's funny in the face of danger."
3,Not as funny as the cover or title implies...,"This is definitely a quick and easy read. Although, it did not make me laugh out loud once...perhaps a smirk now and then. I must say that I was not familiar with Becker's work. Since finishing this book, I googled some of her cartoons for comparison and was not impressed either. As somebody else wrote, the humor is very specific. And I also ditto the comment about the lesbianism. I didn't pick up this book for that. But I do appreciate her volunteerism regarding AIDS. Furthermore, I wish her continued success in her recovery."
4,An Illustrated Memoir,"The cover and cute illustrations might lure a reader looking for humor. It has some humor, but mostly it's a very personal account of a year in the life of Suzy Becker (author, illustrator, lesbian, AIDS activist, and impatient patient).The energy in the book is often angry, sometimes frustrated, frightened, and lonely as she goes through seizures, brain surgery, and recovery. Through it all, the author comes to terms with what is important in her life and gradually builds back the structure she craves. This memoir chronicles that and shows her achievement in overcoming the initial loss of memory, humor, and other abilities.The writing might feel depressing, but the humor in the sketches counterbalances that. A word of caution: some readers may find the interactions with the author's lover more frank than they would wish."
4,I had brain surgery...too!,"I had the pleasure of somewhat relearning how to read using this book after I had brain surgery also. If there is anyone out there that has had brain surgery or knows someone who has had it, it is a must read to get a small taste of what the effects before and after the surgery are. The little scetches in the book are great to add a bit of humor to a huge situation, which is much needed to sit back and laugh at."
5,The Best of Her Brain,"You can't put Suzy Becker's book down. I had brain surgery, what's your excuse? has not one ounce of self-pity. What the reader finds is refreshing frankness. And humor. Great humor. Her illustrations are exacting and draw the reader into her emotional turmoil, frustration, and fear. Suzy Becker isn't afraid to let the reader see who she really is--a woman of great talent who strives for perfection in all her many endeavors. Her book is filled with honesty and humanity. Be prepared to laugh with her, feel her anguish, struggles and her enormous capacity for love. I had brain surgery, what's your excuse? is not a book about brain surgery. Rather, it is about the need and importance of being who we are."
5,A Must Read!,"I've had to read this book twice, and not because of my slow processing speed from my own brain surgery, but because it thoroughly touched my heart.Every hospital with a neurosurgical unit should have in their library a copy of this book, and it should be read by patients and caregivers. It depicts the reality of what could happen after having a craniotomy, and it does so in a warm, humorous, truthful way. Some of the drawings in the book are so humorous that they helped change my attitude towards my own deficits. I feel a little lighter.Had this book been available prior to surgery, I would have been more prepared. Had I read it immediately after surgery (after I learned how to read again) I would have felt comfort to have laughed and cried along with Suzy's experience and not felt so alone. Thanks, Suzy, for bringing light to the reality of brain surgery."
4,Very good,"I read this after hearing an acquaintance talk about having had brain surgery and its effects on her. When she spoke she wore a Tshirt with I Had Brain Surgery...on it. When I commented on the shirt, she told me about this book. I had read Suzy's book about her cat so I was pretty sure I would like this one. There's certainly humor in this book as well, but I really appreciate that she talks about the effect of brain surgery on her relationship with her partner, the struggle to get her family to wholly accept her partner and everything she was doing for Suzy. It's a good book if you want to have an idea of what people with invisible disabilities go through to cope with life while they are recovering."
5,b-girl's review,I just wanted to say that this book is really good. I read the entire book in two days. this is not your ordinary poetry book because I could relate to the poems so well. I'm also from the hood and this book captures many attitudes and feelings from my neighborhood.
3,Road To Greek Wedding review,Decent acting. Nice story of a greek insurance salesman known in the community who has to deal with new owners of the agency who slight the local customers he had built up over the years. He gets romantically involved with his next door neighbor and a wealthy greek woman. Love wins. Nice story. Ethnic overtones are nice.
3,"Too expensive, but of possible use...","I got this mainly for the information about Outlook and while the book is by no means useless, it is also disappointing. It's not consistent with Outlook 2000 Corporate or Workgroup (it can still help but the examples and screenshots are not entirely appropriate) and there are errors in the book, as well as downright bad English. Still, if you can get it cheap or for free, it might be worth something."
3,Wonderful poetic artist,"I love this artist but I can't say the same for the book. This book, while featuring one of the most prolific and beautiful painters in American history, just doesn't show enough of his work in color. There are pages and pages of black and white images that are barely discernable in some some cases. Luckily...I was able to find a lot of his work on line and print it out to add it to the book. Otherwise, there's a lot of information on him and his life and in that case it's a great book."
2,not worth your money,"I used to be a dance teacher and I'm starting to teach my two young daughters dance. I found this DVD to be cheezy, too simple, too short and too 80's. Even the Jazz music it comes with sounds like an 80's department store CD. Sorry, but don't waste your money on this one."
1,"Nice, while they work.","I bought these headlights in July 2011 and they worked great for a few months. They were bright, but about the same as the stock bulbs that only lasted 3 years. Before I hear the ""you touched the bulb when you installed them"" story, I wore cotton gloves and never come in contact with the glass at any time.Shipping did take a little longer than expected even though I paid for 2nd business day delivery it took 4 days."
1,Not worth buying,"I bought these for my 2002 Eclipse that I had just put halos in. The stock bulbs where dim so I opted for these, they shiped quickly enough but the problem I had was they were even worse then the stock,needless to say I removed my halos and these bulbs and went back to jsut the factory headlights."
2,ahmed from dubai,"its little bit bright that the xenon light , and its still working some time one of them doesn't work i check out the the car electricity it was fine and the problem came from the lights"
1,ITS A PLAIN YELLOW LIGHT NOTHING SPECIAL.,"For starters the description says xenon blue halogen bulb, the only thing is blue is the tip of the light bulb, second its not even blue just plain light like any other car, for the price is a big time rippoff, its too expensive and at the store you can find a way better ones and for cheaper. The lights it self are bright but its not what they say it is, dont but nothing from them they just ripping people off."
3,Luke Warm,"This book is only luke warm, so I don't strongly recommend it. Before you purchase this book, please look at the autobiography, written by Lucy, herself. This Desilu book is poorly written/edited, rambling on and on. Furthermore, it dredges up garbage you just don't care about if you really love Lucy. Everyone has said something inappropriate, or acted poorly at sometime in their life. Why read about that garbage when you have loved their work for so long. But even if you want to read that garbage, I still don't recommend this book because it is so poorly written. It was a chore for me to continue reading it, and I actually quit 3/4 of the way through because it just rambled on uselessly."
3,"More ""I Love Lucy"", Than Anything Else...","This is Carol Butler's son. As a big fan of Lucy and Desi, I try my best to read every book I can find on them. I checked this book out from the library, and I'm glad I didn't have to pay for it. Most of the what I read was all about the production and casting of ""I Love Lucy"". Most of what is written in the first few chapters is all about ""I Love Lucy"", and not the stories of the lives of Lucy or Desi. It starts off with a brief summary of their childhoods, then jumps right into ""I Love Lucy"". I only got to page 50 before putting it down. The book is also written in a manner where it's somewhat hard to follow.What is mentioned about them in the beginning is both of their faults, such as Desi's drinking problem, his womanizing and his short temper, as well as Lucy's habit of complete a control freak on the set.Not a very happy book to read on America's favorite TV couple."
3,it's okay....,"this book was okay. as for research, the authors did an excellent job. however, the book might be a bit technical if you want a more personal look at lucy and desi. by this i mean, the book discusses desilu studios's many projects more than enough, etc. it is, though, very interesting and ultamately enjoyable."
1,A sad book,"This book is a sad look on Lucy and Desi's lives. The only thing that the athors are interested in are the sad happenings of these two great people. If you are a Lucy fan, do not read this unless you want to be torn away from Lucy."
2,Not What I Expected!!,"Although this book is thoroughly researched, I find the material disenchanting and does not capture the true essence of Desilu as other books have, such as ""Love, Lucy"" by Lucille Ball and ""A Book"" by Desi Arnaz. As a true LUCY fan, I urge you to read with caution."
5,"""This One Left Me Speechless!""","Hi, I am writing this to intrigue the mind of a true Lucy & Desi fan. This book left me absolutely speechless. It goes deep into the lives of the most loved couple in American history. If you want to find out everything there is to know about Lucille Ball & Desi Arnaz please purchase this book and get totally swept away. You'll feel like you are part of them after you finish this book. I would find myself laughing on one page and crying on the next.Coyne Steven Sanders & Tom Gilbert done a faboulous job. Just take my word, you won't ever regret purchasing this great book! Thank You, Christy Hunter"
2,Kind of boring and dry,"This is kind of a boring and dry book. It mostly talked about the Desilu Studios and how it evolved over the years. I was hoping for more about Desi and Lucy as a couple and their ups and downs in their relationship, but I guess that's in Lucy's Book ""Love, Lucy"" (which I plan to read next). I would recommend this book for Lucy fans as part of their collection, but if you're like me and want the real ""scoop"" about people and their lives, steer clear or be prepared to be skimming over some pages."
2,TMI (Can that be so in a book?),"I wanted to learn more about life with Lucy & Desi, but I felt this book was too detail oriented on the people that worked with them. There were some looks into their lives but I guess I wanted something else. This book was not the personal story I was looking for."
2,Desilu is what is was about.....Less Lucy and Desi,"I was unpleasantly surprised about this book. I love biographies , but this biography was mostly about the business and less about the people.... hence the name. The beginning of the book is sad because you do not get a good feel about how Desi and Lucy meet or their life before Desilu, it was more like a list of every job they had and every person that helped produce whatever they were doing. After the book was over, I didn't feel well informed. They continuously repeat themselves throughout the book. I was pretty disappointed considering how much information is out there about this couple."
2,Missed the mark,"Having been a big fan of ""I Love Lucy"" for so many years, I'm curious to learn more about the behind the scenes aspects of creating the show. For a long while, the standard for books like this was Bart Andrew's marvelous bookI Love Lucy Book. Still hungry for more information, I bought this book, in which I hoped would expand the knowledge base of this show.Unfortunately, I ended up disappointed with this somewhat dry recounting of the business practice of Desliu studios. While the book stays true to the topic, and gives detailed, practical information, it fails to capture the essence of the show in any meaningful way. So many details obscure the joy and interest in the show.If you are interested in the business side of Desilu studios, buy this book. If you want to learn about the show, stick with Bart Andrews."
5,THE BOOK,"I loooooooooved this book. I am a 13 yr. old die-hard Lucy fan and have read many many books on the Lucille/Desi story. This is one of the best books, although it doesn't say much of Lucille and Desi's childhood. It is a tell all of their ups and downs as stars and as lovers. I certainly recommend this book to anyone, all ages."
2,Could not finish,"I was hoping to get some new insight into my favorite TV couple, Lucy & Desi. I was very disappointed with the writing style of this book. The authors seemed to want to call Lucy & Desi liars at every turn, with statements such as "" they claimed or alleged"", etc. It seems to me to be written in a mean-spirited manner, as though they are trying to take the entire cast of I Love Lucy off of the pedestals everyone has placed them on and throw them in the dirt. Now, I am aware that everything was not all peachy all of the time, but I feel there is no need to basically bash everyone. They are all portrayed as very mean, unlikable people. I would stick to the autobiography Lucy herself wrote, Love Lucy. I could not finish this book, as it got mired down in boring details and I really didn't like the way in which the cast of I Love Lucy was portrayed. I would not recommend this book."
4,good,Great book_ I just wish I knew who strong cig. smoke was on a book-very strong_but I aired out and its better than ever. I am the biggest Lucy fan and was a great read.
1,Their True Life,"The book ""Desilu"" is really a heart-breaking book on Lucy and Desi's lives. The authors seems to meditate only on the fallings of these two people and they seem to enjoy the chance to write on someone that had a hard life backstage. It is one thing to tell about their TRUE life but this book is TOO much. I would not recomend this book to anyone especially a Lucy fan. My friend read it and can't get himself to watch the show anymore.If you want to read a book on them, I would instead recomend: ""Love Lucy"" by Lucille herself (I give that one five plus stars) and/or ""I Love Lucy"" by Michael McClay (five stars). I have read them both and they are both very nicely writen and I'm sure you will enjoy them."
4,READ DESILU BOOK,"I READ BOTH ""DESILU"" AND ""LOVE,LUCY"" THEY ARE EXCELLENT BOOKS. WE CANT COMPARE ONE TO THE OTHER BECAUSE LUCY WROTE (LOVE).WELL, SHE HAD ALL THIS INTERVIEWS DONE IN THE 60S. DESILU IS A VERY DEEP LOOK AT THE COMPLEX WORLD OF THE TV INDUSTRY.I HIGHLY RECOMEND BOTH; THEY ARE GREAT READING MATERIAL FOR ANY LUCY FAN."
5,Fabulous book!!!,"I am a young die hard Lucy fan, and this was one of the first books I read about her, and to this day it is still one of the best. I started reading this book one day, and I finished it the next day. I just couldn't put it down. I recommend this to anyone that knows anything about Lucy or Desi, this tells everything you could want to know."
2,Dry as toast!,"I wrote the following as a comment to another review, but thought that perhaps I should also post as a separate review, for those who might miss it otherwise! I was terribly disappointed with all of the ""facts and figures"" that were so overly-detailed in this book! Percentages, ratings, dollar amounts, etc., etc. I didn't want to read a ""Wall Street"" accounting of this show; I wanted what it promised: behind-the-scenes information about Lucy, Desi, and all of the rest of the cast, crew, and guests who comprised the ""I Love Lucy"" show! It seems as if it took FOREVER to get through this book, due to the fact that it was SO mired down with useless business information and statistics; there were times that I actually had to FORCE myself to pick it up again, and I have NEVER felt like that about any of the other books that I have read about Lucy and the gang! Skip this one, unless you're an accountant, or someone who loves the DRY behind-the-scenes look at Desilu's financial statement!"
4,An entry level book on geometric modeling,"This book is a definitive introduction to geometric modeling. However, the sections on solid modeling and surface-surface intersection are lacking in depth. A serious reader may consider consulting books by Farin and Piegl for Geometric modeling and Hoffman/Mantyla for solid modeling."
5,SE Using Macromedia Director is an awesome book!!!,"This book is probably the best book you will ever find on how to use Director. I read it without knowing anything about programming and i am pretty advanced now. If you feel that you are a really slow learner and/or you have no experience using a computer, don't try to learn anything about director. If, however, you are a motivated student, Gary Rozensweig will teach you from the ground up about this ultra-powerful program. For 36 dollars, it's almost a must. This book will also be great for advanced director users as a reference. get it quickly. The only drawback of this book is the fact that one of the most important appendices is almost totally missing(publishing error). There is a downloadable version of the appendix on QUE's site (HTML & PDF). Don't let this tiny glitch stop you from owning the best book on director out there!!!"
2,Better books to buy,"I was greatly disappointed with this book, being it was from Williams Sonoma I thought it would be top shelf. The book was lacking in both quality and quantity of recipes. The Coastal Living Cookbook and The Outer Banks Cookbook: Recipes & Traditions from North Carolina's Barrier Islands are great seafood cookbooks, I would recommend buying one of those instead."
1,Don't waste your money.,Don't waste your time and money on this packet. I tried to file these and the clerk informed me that almost every single form in this packet hasn't been used since around 1997!
4,"old school, but worth the money","this is a package of forms. no disk. no pdfs. you will need to scan these and either makes copies, or convert to pdf. I converted to PDF with adobe acrobat PRO. (to make it typeable) While you can get most of the forms you need in Maricopa county from the court website, you can not get them all. (you need your own decree form) This pack also has examples of filled forms, so you have an idea of the kind of information should be in each form. This is well worth the small price for the pack. I was able to use this and the forms from the county website to do my own. If both parties are in total agreement, then this pack is of good use. We did our own, and the only expense was the county filling fee. If you use the decree form, and do a default judgement, you will need to block out the part that says you are going to mail a copy to the respondent. (the court will mail you both copies in the envelopes you provide)Go slow. If you need help, contact an attorney."
1,WHERE'S MY STUFF,"I can't honestly review this item since I ordered it and it was never delivered; yet I got an e-mail saying that my order was returned for non delivery. Who knows what house they went to to deliver. I have someone home at all times who could have accepted the delivery of this product. So...if you order from Amazon, don't expect to get it."
4,Great Price,This briefcase/computer portfolio is good looking and durable.The price is right and the briefcase lasts just as long as the more expensive briefcases.
4,Good choice,I bought this watch for my dad as a christmas gift.It's a great watch for michigan fans however the lcd screen is not that bright as it is shown in the picture.
3,GREAT ITEM (BUT WHERE ARE THE CLIPS,i bought this item it came fast in the mail will no trouble but where are the clips that are in the pic plz help???
4,Leave the tour guides behind,"If you're going to the DR and are going anywhere other than the resorts, you won't regret your time spent reading this book. If you are going to the resorts, you won't be experiencing the DR anyway so don't worry about it.Here's what you get:1- lots of detail2- no ads or cheap plugs3- first hand accountEnjoy !!"
1,Worst Book I've Ever Read...,"This is quite probably the worst book I've ever read. The only reason I got past page 2 was that it lands so soundly in the unintentional comedy category that I couldn't stand to put it down. The author apparently is from Texas but I refuse to believe he's ever been to Austin. He has Irish mob bosses battling it out with Chinese Triad...in Austin, TX?Not to mention his little paragraph about the unpredictability of the weather there...huh? It's hot and dry in the summer. Cool and dry in the winter. There is no ""90 degrees one day and snow the next"". It snows an inch every 20 years or so. And there are dozens more bizarre little things like that in this book.The complete lack of research aside, the writing is absolutely awful and the dialog laughable. So unless you want a good laugh at the author's expense and can find this free in your library, don't waste your time."
5,Very Nice,"Purchased for my nine year old's birthday, this bible is very hip without being too little girl. Sidebars are frequent and helpful and the personal scenarios included are nice to solidify a point. I do not have the women of faith bible, but I have considered getting it to go along with my daugheter's new bible."
4,Serves its purpose,Althought this bible was made for younger girls I find it very handy for breaking down scripture and explaining things. Once I have finished utilizing it for my purposes I plan on passing it down to my niece who the book was originally intended for. It was a bit more used than I expected but it serves it's purpose just fine.
2,Wishing I could return it...,"When I saw this online I thought it was meant for girls in their late teens early 20's, however when I received it in the mail, I was bummed to discover that it wasn't at all what I'd expected and is probably better suited for someone of a younger age. I am now wishing I could return the product and get something else with the money... Is there any way to do that???"
5,Young Women of Faith Bible (NIV) review,"I purchased several of these biblesYoung Women of Faith Bible (NIV)as gifts for a group of inner city girls I am ministering to. These are awesome Bibles for young girls/women. They have gone from the ""dread"" of reading the Bible to looking forward to it. This helps to make the Bible relative to their lives today. It is beautifully packaged and includes notes that relate to them well. A beautiful Bible."
4,Great boots,I was nervous getting tall boots online b/c I have had trouble finding ones that are small enough to fit my calves. These boots fit perfectly and they are now city tested.
4,Mcse Readiness Review 70-58,After taking a course and studing with test prep programs I took the test. I failed by 133 points. After the test I went to the book store and looked thought every review book the store had to offer. This book had the questions that the real test had asked. After reviewing this guide I took the test again and passed with well over 800.
1,Terrible Image Quality,I recently ordered Broadway posters from multiple vendors. The image quality of this poster is terrible. The top and bottom of the poster has been cut off. The paper is flimsy and not as thick as other posters I have ordered. I would avoid Poster Revolution unless they are your only option.
5,Good enough for government work,"The only drawback of this cable -- that is still made up for by the price -- is that the connector seems to fit loosely. Not a problem, since the audio equipment doesn't pick itself up and move around that often."
1,Doesn't fit right,"I bought this cable to connect my Playstation 2 to my Sony audio receiver. The connector does not fit correctly in either of the two devices. If I push hard, it'll get to a point where it'll be in enough to get a good signal through and not have the connector fall out. What were they thinking?"
2,"Cheap, but you get what you pay for.","First off, this book is a bargain as far as textbooks go, hence the 2 stars.That said, you get what you pay for. Explanations are brief and supported by simple example problems. Additional topics that should receive attention within the chapter are relegated to end of chapter problems. If you are never assigned those problems, chances are you'll never learn those topics. If you are assigned those problems, good luck because the supporting chapter offers little help.Finally, this book is filled with errors (11 just in the first 100 pages). There are actually websites listing the errors. Whenever I have homework, I check the website before starting, otherwise I'd spend hours trying to correct a problem because my answer didn't match the one in the back of the book. The book is 1994... who knows why they haven't fixed the errors."
3,will not use this text again,"I have used this book several times... it is readable but it does NOT have enough exercises. Considering the fact that the even ones do not have answers, there are very few exercises for a college lever course. I ended up making up exercises quite a few times to supplement the exercises in the text. Also the author covers topics in exercises that should be covered in the text itself. The book does not cover the logistics equation at all in the section on population growth- that is no good. An an example of lack of exercises, in the section on homog. linear constant coefficient DE's, he has 19 basic problems, so that means 1/2 of these can be assigned since the other half do not have answers.It is a readable text but just does not have enough problems; also putting topics in exercises that should be in the text itself is irritating.I will NOT use this text again. I teach math at Penn State Erie since 1984."
5,Perfect,This worked great for the 2 rooms I knocked down. I wouldn't have gone any bigger than this for standard walls and ceilings as it seemed to do the job just fine in the limited time you have to knock the texture down.
1,SP 5700 Discontinued by Infocus.,Please be aware these units are dicontinued by the factory. Sony is a better choice.
1,Terrible,"This was a terrible series. The story progression was difficult or impossible to follow. Plotlines moved forward seemingly at random, and there was a total disconnect between events shown on the screen and the ""story arc"", if it could even be called that. When plot twists came, they seemed to have come out of nowhere, and were contrived and hard to follow. Many of the episodes were just a jumble of events and it was hard to tell what was really happening and what was somebody's imagination. Many points were left unexplained. I don't think the creators actually intended this to be a complete story -- and it seemed like even the animators got lazy at the end, which was depicted with just a few poorly drawn sketches and some incomprehensible live action sequences.DO NOT BUY."
2,Animación y argumento pobres,"Confusa y repetitiva, le falta fluidez a la historia, tienes que adquirir la segunda parte para entederla en su totalidad.Argumento pobre y poco entendible, quisieron hacerla oscura y lo unico que lograron fue que a la trama le faltara mayor brillatez y calidad en los colores."
1,Product arrived with damaged part,"This machine arrived with the top damaged. It appeared that it had been returned by someone and shipped back out to me. I called the manufacturer and explained the situation, stating that if they would send the damaged part I would not have to return the product. They said I should receive the part in approximately one week. It has now been 4 weeks, my return time from Amazon has expired, I have received nothing from the manufacturer, and I'm stuck with a machine stand that I can't use. I would not recommend this product or Safco, the manufacturer."
4,fast hot water,"I can't say about durability over years because I've only had it for a month, but its everything I hoped for -- the automatic shut off works, but sometimes it seems like it shuts off well after the water has been boiling for a while. I have no problems with spilling when pouring. Overall very useful."
5,Works great and looks nice,I use a hot pot to boil the water for french press coffee. My old pot died. As I was throwing it away I noticed that it had a good 1/4 iinch of brown mineral deposits at the bottom. Yuck.That won't happen with this one because the lid opens wide enough to clean inside it. It also lets you fill it up more quickly. I've had it for a couple of months and it works fine. I also like that the cord winds around a keeper hidden in the base so you only need to let out what you need and not add to the cord tangle on the counter.I read some of the other comments and would agree that it pours too wide for a cup. You'd have to be careful. But I'm filling a coffee press so that works to my advantage.
2,Disappointing,"Really 2.5 stars. This kettle boils water very quickly. The pouring spout is poorly designed and dangerous. After a few months of daily use, the auto shut off feature stopped working. Now, it will just boil forever. I'm looking to replace this soon."
1,Don't leave this kettle unattended!,"I bought this because of favorable reviews from various sources and I still use it after a little over a year, but it's not without issues. A few months after purchase, the automatic shutoff stopped working. It still boils water quickly and efficiently, but I have to watch it and turn it off manually each time. I wouldn't buy it again."
4,"Works great, but quality control problems","I love this kettle. It works fast. It's easy to fill and clean, too. The problem is quality control. I've returned one because the top didn't close well. I returned a second (bought separately for a different home) because the thermostatic shutoff didn't work quickly enough to keep the pot from overheating. After a year or so, the first one developed the same problem with not shutting off. That one now gets hot enough to burn your hand on the handle if you don't shut it manually."
5,An excellent pot,"I just purchased my second Chef's Choice electric kettle. This one was for my daughter to take to college for tea and hot chocolate. The whole family loves the one we've had for almost 2 years. I bought it because Alton Brown from Good Eats recommended it. He puts a lot of research into whatever he recommends and he was right. I only boil bottled or filtered water in it and it never needs cleaning. I make tea every day and it always tastes fresh. I also use it to pre-boil water when I make pasta or corn-on-the-cob. It boils so much quicker in the electric kettle than waiting for a big pot to boil on the stove, even if it takes a couple of batches in the kettle. I don't ever want to be without this electric kettle!"
1,stoped working after a month,"This thing stopped turning off after a boil, a month after I bought it. it's lid isn't really sealed so the vapors come out.nice design - nothing more."
1,Chef's choice wrong choice,This is not the product I thought it would be and it is a total disapointment
1,Disappointing!,"Soon after receiving the 675, the spring that holds the lid in place was no longer working, and the lid popped up once the water came to a boil, causing the automatic shut-off to NOT SHUT OFF. I have since removed the spring. The automatic shut-off works now. The spout pours wider than a mug, causing dangerously hot spillage. I've just purchased a different brand and hope for better than this delivered."
2,Worked very well... for a while,"I bought this item just over a year ago... I guess that's why it doesn't work now... the warranty expired. But for the time it did work, it was simply ""sufficient"", I mean it did boil water. I used it nearly everyday in my office.After a couple of months the automatic shut-off stopped working, and the lid started to ""warp""I think this time I'll look for something a bit more durable."
4,My best friend,"For the longest time I would use the microwave oven to heat up water for tea, melt butter, boil an array of liquids. This tea kettle is wonderful. It has a wide opening for putting in things, like eggs for example for easy removal. Very reliable and fast. I dropped mine. The top broke, but it still works 2 years later without failing me once."
4,Works great!,I bought this item on the recommendation of a friend. It's works great with heating water quickly. It definitely takes less than half the time of a microwave oven. I suppose the only issue is the automatic shutoff. It does work but it takes a little longer than I would like; the water is at full boil for at least 15 seconds before it shuts off.
4,A car salesman with a conscience,"Have you ever met a used car salesman with a conscience? British journalist Lawrence Donegan tries to put his ethics behind him when he turns down the chance of a hot corporate job to find the 'real America' by selling used cars. This is a very funny book and yet poignant as well. It's beautifully written and you find yourself quickly absorbed with Donegan and the bunch of cohorts who work alongside him, trying to pounce on anyone who dares to walk on to their used car lot. Definitely recommended."
5,California Dreaming ---does it for me!,"It's the kind of book you have to renew after three weeks at the library---to go through again....Funny in kind of a non-neurotic, non Spaulding Gray style....If you've ever lived in California, it adds to the fun. This book was just a pleasure to read, to get myself out of myself...Informative about the used car buz....funny, realistic and enjoyable.....I was here again, buying a copy of the book, looking at the reviews, agreeing with this one, and discovered it was mine.....Oh Scooty!!!!"
2,Unsatisfied,"While I did finish reading this book, I'm not sure why. I didn't find it very amusing.For its length, one doesn't really learn very much about the used car business, the author, life in California, or much else."
5,rare pleasure,"Amy brings so much to contemporary Hawaiian music. She has the native history but also the modern music school training. This is a choice collection of songs with very fine Hawaiian musicians to accompany Amy on this delightful disc. Most songs are sung in Hawaiian but her pronunciation is very articulate and the liner notes are written in Hawaiian and translated to English for easy reference. She struggles admirably to reach the falsetto heights on Kau'ionalani (#6) but every other track is a joy. Most selections are lilting melodies but Tahiti Nui is a sweet tropical lark with blazing ukulele. See the grass skirts fly!! The final track is a real class act. ""Jewel"" is a touching affirmation to her fellow Hawaiians delivered by an artist who really is in a position to lend a gifted hand up."
5,SILOS ROCK!!!,"This is one of the best rock albums from the 90's. Walter Salas-Humara is a brilliant song writer. Great production - minmal with a terrific ""live"" sound, raunchy guitars, great instrumentation. When you get fed up with the overly-dubbed, overproduced drivel that floods the airwaves - put this disk in, turn it up, and bask in it's honesty....."
4,"SORRY, THIS WORDS AREN'T A REVIEW BUT...",I'm a spanish girl and I don't now how to get the liric about 'SUSAN ACROSS THE OCEAN'.Somebody can help me? I love this song and I want to know the liric.My e-mail adress: picusunchu@hotmail.comThank you very much.Su.
2,Not what they used to be,"When the Two Leaves and a Bud Jasmine Petal Green tea first came out, it was organic and the best Jasmine Green Tea I had tasted. Now? It's a few steps up from a Jasmine Green from Bigelow and Twinnings and that's not saying much. I'm very disappointed. I'm sure that due to a poor economy and few being able to afford their steep prices, the quality has been cut - they must have a new supplier of tea leaves or something.This product has gone way down, unfortunately. Now, my go to Jasmine Green is from Mighty Leaf... and theirs is half as good as what Two Leaves and a Bud used to be."
3,Book should match software,"In my case the book was part of the Freebsd 4.2 software package.I found it to be basically informative but when it came down to the nitty-gritty of performing certain installations, not correctly documented in some cases. If your serious about learning FreeBSD, then I suggest using the WEB resources. The info on the web is continuously updated as is bsd! Makes good sense. I will buy the handbook and every susequent release in the future."
5,Greg Lehey did it again !!!,"This book has complete coverage of most of FreeBSD topics, including an interesting and helpful Postfix chapter.It's easy to read, has many information and examples and it was written by Greg Lehey, a Core Team Member, envolved on BSD since the early Berkeley days.The fist chapter introduces the reader the history of Unix and BSD before entering on technical discussions. There are chapters dedicated (deeply) to X, Samba, Apache, Firewall and many more.The weakest part Complete FreeBSD are the chapters about CVS ad upgrading, but the Kernel customization chapter that comes after brings back the high value of this book.This Complete FreeBSD is a must-have to any FreeBSD user and admnistrator. Use it in conjunction with Unix Power Tools and the FreeBSD Handbook and you you will have 99% of the information you neeed."
2,Save your money,This book is a hard copy of the online documentation you can get for free at freeBSD.org except that it doesn't match the version of freeBSD that is shipped on the CD.
2,Documnetation fronm the source? NOT,"I was expecting documentation from the source code (ie. a description of how FreeBSD internals work). This book is just another ""How to use FreeBSD"" book like any other.As a result I found the title very misleading and the book did not do what I expected."
1,Not the book to learn FreeBSD,"I bought this book based on the reviews here. I know very little about using Unix. I flipped through the book and found it easy to read as well as covering all the topics that other books missed. What bothered me was the size of the book which made me think some topics might get skimmed over.This book lacks focus. It may start on a topic then wander off, never to return. Some topics are introduced but never explained. Others go into more detail as you go deeper into the book...maybe.At times I felt the writer assumed you had some knowledge of FreeBSD/Unix but, if this is true, why would he explain some very basic operations, including installation?I would return this book if I had not marked it up as I started reading. I had almost bought ""FreeBSD Unleashed"" having read part of it a year ago at the library and now I wish I did."
3,Incomplete,"This book was really good to a point, and then just as you were about to solve a problem, it went on to another topic. I became tired of the constant teasing.My other comment has to do with FreeBSD in general. The installer sucks! If you want a really good UNIX type operating system, I recommend Debian. It's installer is equally cryptic, but unlike FreeBSD, if you figure out what is being asked, and make your decisions accordingly, the correct things get installed. FreeBSD, on the otherhand fails to do so in many instances."
4,"A good book, but only if you have experience with unix","Over all this is a great book. It is only usefull howver, to the semi-experienced user. It is not for somone who has never used any type of UNIX before. For somone converting from Linux or any other UNIX this is a great book."
2,Poorly Written,"Mr.Lehey wrote this book as if its some kind of a shorthand for him! The information presented is definately not clear. It may probably make sense to ppl who already have some BSD background, but not for those who want to know more about BSD. Buy this book only if you want a fast and a good, night sleep."
4,alot of n00b info but not too bad,"If you buy this and know your way around any of the other *nixes somewhat ..... I'd read it backwards ..... in fact the new method of compiling the kernel isn't until the last chapter. There is quite a bit of info that's not available in the handbook (online) but its mainly ""author insight/method's"" .... I've found very little of it useful myself ..... but anyone new to FreeBSD should find it ""almost flawless"" .. If you know your way aruond and want to get into the finer details (kernel, ports, etc) i'd get Absolute BSD -- Michael Lucas, it'll cover what this one doesn't and ... better yet ... it never hurts to buy them both !!!!"
3,"pretty good, but falls short sometimes","this book was extremely helpful and informative throughout the installation process. it would have been wiser to stick w/ this format when discussing other relevant OS topics (i.e File systems) -- unfortunately the author occassionally meanders off while drawing contrasts b/w Windows and UNIX systems. (eg. the discussion on the limitations of eight dot three file names vs no such stupid thing in UNIX) thanks but if you just tell me what to do in UNIX i can figure the differences out myself. Good book for the most part, sprinkles of UNIX rhetoric notwithstanding."
3,Not bad at all for the only book but...,"This book does a fair of taking the new FreeBSD user into the realm of Unix. However, a lot of the examples do not point out how to get to get to a particular files contents, It needs to be in a particular order for taking someone through a first time set-up. For example, there are file contents or listings in the early chapters that show material before the system is even set up. The section on PPP is very vague for getting someone onto the Internet through a dial-up connection. The sample desktop is a GREAT kick start to getting a desktop going. There is not enough of those types of things. Having the man pages is good if you want to see the syntax of a command (but it's half the book). If the target audience is for more experienced users it should be noted before purchasing. I want FreeBSD because I feel it is the better OS, even though I have to work harder to get it to that point. I wish there were a better book!"
2,Title is misleading,I bought this book hoping it would go a little in more depth on what to expect when eggs are laid and what happens when they begin to hatch but it is basically a book that tells you a little of everything about lovebirds. The photo's were nice and the information was good but it wasn't what I expected.
5,ALL ABOUT BREEDING LOVEBIRDS,"I read the book from cover to cover and found it to be very helpful in points about breeding lovebirds. Still finding out the sex of the lovebirds seems to be somewhat of a mystery, I foudn the book to be very entertaining and useful in what I was looking for. I would recommend this book to anyone."
3,Talk about stereotyping!,"I purcahsed this book and am not too crazy about it. While the author discusses important issues, there were times where I felt she was making too many generalizations. Overall, it was an ""okay"" read."
4,A Vibrant Live Recording - Will have you tapping your toes!,"While a lot of live recordings are a real disappointment, here is a splendid live recording that will have you thirsting for more. Recorded live in Paris, Timbuk 3 plays a wide variety of songs (including some previously unrealeased) with a powerful backing band and shows what a live recording can be. Having seen the band live many times I approached this recording with cautiion. I was expecting the usual flat live greatest hits package. Ha, was I wrong. While Timbuk 3 has since split up, this recording will always serve as a remnder of how good they were to see live."
4,Very nice,"Love the album ""Big Shot in the Dark."" This lets you hear them live with the full band from this album."
2,Mail review of order,"The item I purchase arrived in a torn, rippped envelope that had tire marks on the outside. The book inside, of course, was damaged, with the first five pages having tire marks and holes. I contacted the seller asking if the package had been insured, which it had not. I purchased the book for a gift, which I cannot give in this condition...I'm disappointed in the mail not the seller. Debbe Triplett"
1,BUYER BEWARE!,"BUYER BEWARE This is $72.54 over the price of buying the seasons seperately. ""Amazon, you greedy ba....."""
1,Rip off,"Don't get me wrong, I love Curb your Enthusiasm, but it makes me so angry that they try to rip everyone off with this box set price. You can save about $60 by purchasing the seasons separately!"
5,Excellent meat slicer!,"The performance of Chef's Choice 667 food slicer is excellent.It had been on my wish list for years but I wanted a real good one with a large blade to do the job right: one that would cut the prosciutto paper-thin. THIS IS IT!It slices prosciutto, bresaola, beef carpaccio, ahi (Tuna) carpaccio thin thin thin like it is suppose to be without difficulty.I am thrilled with it!Finally we can have prosciutto, carpaccio at home...sliced right, like they would in Italy.....oh what a treat!I have used this slicer to cut vitello tonnato too.It is a great pleasure to prepare appetizers for ourself or when entertaining friends with no effort whatsoever!!!It is easy to clean but the trick is to cut the meat frozen.....!!!!!"
2,High End Amateur Slicer,"This slicer is definitely not 'professional'. It would never pass a food inspector's visit. Cleaning time is upwards of 30 minutes per session. I doubt it can be entirely cleaned. The carriage takes only 5"" lengths of meat. The blade guard is removed with a 5mm allen, not in every kitchen's toolkit. The three screws securing the glide plate are too long, so they made up for it by a adding a few washers which are quickly lost beneath the deck through the same gap that meat juices fall through into the motor compartment."
4,Some problems,"A good slicer that does the job and easily cuts through the meat to the thickness desired and selected. Some minor problems come with this slicer though. With the small area behind the blade, it is awkward grabbing the meat as it comes out after having been sliced. The small tray slides and meat falling down easily pushes it to the side, and in one case, even pushed it off the slicer entirely. Not hard to clean up, comes apart easily. When I was cleaning the slicer, 2 pieces slipped out when I tipped the slicer to reach underneath to the base. These pieces were a shaped rod and a spring. I am having trouble finding out where they go as they are not mentioned in the manual at all, and now the slicer won't even power up. Trying to get through to the company for help. Overall, a very good slicer that does what is advertised and I would recommend it as long as others were aware of the problems."
4,Great,Like it. Now we can slice the lamb meet to paper thin pieces.Great for hot pots.Liitle bit hard to clean up.
1,Extremely buggy,"I use & love many Adobe products, especially Photoshop. But Encore 1.01 is by far the worst quality Adobe software I've ever seen. I find it almost impossible to finish a project, at some point it will eventually hang opening the project file and my work is lost. Also there are many obvious & ""dumb"" bugs which are really annoying, problems with transcoding & video import etc. It's as if nobody even tried to build a few DVDs with this before they released it.To give you an idea, I had a dollar for every time this has hung and I've had to kill it from Task Manager, I'd have paid for the software by now (i.e. hundreds of times).The nice feature is integration with photoshop, but that is not enough to compensate for the terrible software quality. For a product at this price point it's criminal, and very unlike Adobe.I completed one project with this and then gave up using it. I'm hoping 1.5 is better quality, I don't care if they add ANY new features I just want them to fix the bugs!"
2,Horribly Buggy Software,"They had their heart in the right place with this software, but apparently their brains were on vacation. This is NOT worth the price tag. If you try to build anything with a slight degree of complexity, the program will crash and destroy all your work. Google it, this is not an isolated problem. This is alpha software that was rushed out and is not ready for prime time. I have seen the same problems in versions 1,1.1, 1.5 and (to a slightly lesser degree) 2.0."
1,buggy,"This is a buggy product.I tried to create a DVD with menus and subtitles. The menus worked fine. But when I added some subtitles, Encore started to crash with ""Out of Memory"" error.When it crashed, not only did it corrupt the current project, it somehow corrupted an earlier saved project as well. Perhaps it was already corrupt but did not manifest itself until later.I then tried adding subtitles on another computer with more memory (512MB), but it crashed just the same.I checked the support forum at Adobe and realized that I'm not alone on this issue.Eventually I resorted to using a freeware to create subtitles and then import them into Encore. But eventually I ran into another error: ""disc in inconsistent state"" while building the DVD. Fortunately, someone on the Adobe support forum pointed out a workaround.This review applies to version 1.0.1.Version 1.5 has just been announced."
3,Excellent shoes but sizing is not right...,"My husband wears 10.5 and those shoes do not have 1/2 sizes. I got 11 and 10 to see which pair would fit, but neither one did. Otherwise, nice color selection and as much as I can tell nice quality. Rating of 3 due to sizing."
4,Purchased as a gift,"My dad loves Irish music and has recently really gotten into music dvds. I got this for him as a gift and while he liked the music, he said the quality of the dvd was a bit lower than he would have expected."
2,The worse film of Barbra...but...,"Well..I got the film recently cause I want to collect all the film of Barbra..I am a big fan of her..So I purchase it from the Amazon even though I herad about it is not a good one, but I thought...how worse could it be when it is played by Barbra?Yes..it is really bad, pointeless story,boring dialogue,I only wonder why she accepted to play the main role in succh a bad movie..Afterwards, if you are the same big fan like me,maybe you should still keep it,this is really only bad film from her I guess...for those movie fan weant to see a good movie but not the fan of her...forget about tis one!!"
3,Not Excellent,"This is a typical Enid Blyton book.Jolly Boarding School.Female main character who is flawless.Re-occurring things--friendship, midnight feasts, some kind of mean girl, a new girl that is nice...stuff like that. These books are basically the same as the St. Clares series (which happens to be by the same author! :-o)I'm kind of old for these books now, but they can be fun once in a while--but, it would be nice if they had a little variety.P.S. What are all the mysterious OTHER Malory Towers books written by some person called Pamela Cox?"
1,Rare O-Reilly dissapointment,"Unfortunately, I usually trust that I can pick up an O'Reilly technical book and be confident that it is one of the finest works both for accuracy and completeness of content -- this title is the rare exception.I have been developing for and managing terabyte plus Oracle databases for a number of years -- this title lacks the practical gotchas and information needed to effectivly manage and develop parallel systems with any degree of complexity.If you have a large database and need to break simple jobs up then you may find the title has adequate coverage; however, if you are dealing with complex data models, with situations where you have a great deal of object colision (and hence waits and latch contention), then this title will not meet your needs."
3,Nice rocking chair reading,"The book describes the Oracle parallel concept and features in an easy understandable way by words, repeating the same information several times on different pages. But even basic admin knowhow (e.g. how to access a parallel server db by Net8), useful SQL-code examples (forget about the bunch of selects shown how to query a V$-view) and clear detailed strategies how to do (e.g. what is a good estimation for the value of the DEGREE parameter) are missing. I easily got through that book in one evening sitting in my rocking chair. And I did not miss my computer with Oracle on it. Make the philosophical text half as long by cutting away what is said twice, and use the pages for the ""real stuff"", then you will have a usefull book. The 3 stars rating basically reflects its repertoire value."
1,Rehash of information already in Parallel Server Documentati,"I found that this book contain lots of info that is already present in the Oracle Documentation. Actually some of the SQL queries (even with mistakes) are directly copied from the Oracle Parallel Server Doc (7.3+). I don't see any additional information added that is new in this book. Not sure if the authors have seen any large production Parallel Server systems, but there is no usefull real life information in this book. For example how to tune large Oracle Parallel Server Systems. If you want a summary of the oracle doc, then you should buy this."
4,Well done . . .,"This is a excellent book that goes over what you need to know about Oracle Parallel Processing. The documentation is clear and concise. If additional information is need, references to Oracle Documentation are noted throughout the book. Picking this book up just for the Parallel Execution chapters (Ch 3 - Ch 5) is worth it even if you are not using Oracle Parallel Server."
1,"Cute, but flimsy","Purchased this for my 17-month son who loves rolling backpacks. After being used twice, the seam of the inner lining ripped and the snaps that reinforce the backpack to the handle cannot stay snapped. It may be that putting a stuffed Buzz Lightyear doll, play cell phone and self-propelled car are too much weight. If so, I'd highly recommend this very cute product for small items that total a weight less than 5 lbs."
2,Give it the heave-ho .......,"The biggest problem in this book is the plot. This story rarely revolves around the Plot - Threat of a Rocket inside the US. Instead it meanders around everything other than the main plot. It seems the author had decided to write about specific scenes and later came up with a plot that was made to fit around the scenes.When I finished reading this book I recollected a classic story in our country. A Student , for his essay in an Exam, reads about Trees. Instead the Essay in the Question Paper asks about cows. He proceeds to write everything about Trees and ends the essay by writing that a cow can be tied to the Tree.The only factor going for this book is it goes at a brisk pace..."
2,Way below Mill's usual work,I bought the audio version. I kept having to restart the tapes because the story just could not hold my interest. The story just wasn't up to the level I have grown to expect from this author.
5,Great story but pushed limits of beleivability,"This was a great story, even better than a Clancy book - more action and less verbage. The main character is again Mark Beamon, an older and slightly used up FBI agent put out to pasture as Special Agent in Charge at the Phoenix office. He gets pulled into a complicated case by his former partner Laura Vilechi who has been placed in charge of finding a missing rocket launcher held by Yasin, a powerful Afghan terrorist. The case gets much more complicated involving Volkov, a powerful drug lord and other drug dealers, the mafia, CIA bosses, and his own FBI boss. I would love to see another Beamon story but I do not know where Mr. Mills could possibly take him further."
3,sphere of influence,"Interesting story and set up. The setting of conflict between CIA and FBI in the drug wars is plausible. The idea of burnout in a bureaucratic organization and the fact that the criminal mind can be fascinating makes it easy reading.Having said that there are some inconsistancies. The Mafia entity, Gasta, seems too stupid. It is hard to believe he would not have been eliminated by natural competition earlier.Laura is another weak person She does not have many original ideas, but is apparently beyond a world class athelete since she can run and catch a truck going 15 miles per hour. Not only can she do that, she also passes the truck, has time to turn around and shoot several times, and fall flat before the truck hits her. Maybe her name should be Cheetah.All that said it is an interesting story, and I recommend it for light reading."
3,"Fun, but unbelievable","This was a pretty quick read, and once I got to around page 200, I was thoroughly enjoying it. If you tend to give up on books early, I would warn you away from this one. It starts slow, and quite a few of the early plot points are either confusing or just not credible.The story centers Mark Beamon and Laura Vilechi (sp?), two rogue CIA guys (the villains), and an underground criminal called Christian Volkov. The story starts rolling and becomes fun when Beamon pops out of his FBI persona and begins acting in concert with Volkov. That was cool! It was even somewhat believable until Beamon in the end is able to return to the US without any legal trouble.I am tired of rogue CIA guys that can get operation support to gun people down. It like there is potential for a fifth column at every turn."
1,Audio version could not hold my interest.,"Want to hear a great story of terrorists taunting the USA on its' own turf?You won't find it in this novel. This audio book lost my interest by the second tape of eight. Nothing exciting happens here.It's one scene after another of people sitting around tables discussingthe problems of the world. I'm sorry, but I can't recommend this book."
4,Well Done,"Sphere of Influence by Kyle Mills is sort of a relaxed thriller. There's suspense, but not too much. There's thrills, adventure and misadventure, but not too much, and there's Beamon who fits just right into a story about the things that can happen when all you want is out of this job. The writing is smooth and tight but the tension is not as high as most thrillers, letting you get a better feel for the characters. The story has a few unlikely twists, but the author keeps it all believable and there is little dead time as the action builds steadily into a solid conclusion. This is the first time I have read Mills and I really enjoyed the book"
1,Not as advertised,This product does not fit the Holmes HAP412. Bought them to fit it and they are way to small to fit it. Do not buy.
2,The Phantom of the Opera (Original 1986 London Cast),"The music in this CD is beautiful, the lyrics are lovely as well. The fact that I don't like Michael Crawfords' voice might have something to do with this...Gerard Butler was the first Phantom I heard.... so I hold my standards to him. Michael Crawfords' voice is nice, I'll admit, but give me Gerry any day. Perhaps Michael DID have a voice suited for the role, and perhaps Gerard Butler didn't, but I'm partial to emotional songs to wooden-flat ones, and baritone voices to tenor voices. Sarah has a lovely voice, but in my opinion, it is a bit too mature for the part of a 16 year old girl.But don't let this stop you-buy this CD...you may love it, you may hate it. Just compare Michael's voice to Gerard's voice...the difference is rather laughable."
5,brilliant,"I bought this soundtrack for my 15 year old son and this is his review. I took him to see the Phantom back in March. He kept saying, ""Mom, I didn't want it to end"". He was always humming the songs and taught himself how to play them on his guitar. I bought the soundtrack for him and ""brilliant"" is his word. I myself have seen the Phantom 3 times and it always gives me goosebumps. This soundtrack surprised us both because it is the whole play. We enjoy it because we can relive the production over and over whenever we want and we don't have to wait for it to come to town. It is truly amazing!"
5,IT'S THE BEST,who ever said this was a bad musical is crazy. And you do not know what your talking about
3,The only Phantom of the Opera you'll ever need.,"First of all, there has never been--and will never be--a better recording of this score. But do you like the score? A lot of people find it hit or miss. But it's got some good performances, and a lot of the music is quite likable, though it may take you more than one listen to completely ""get it."" Unfortunately, repeated listens also reveal a more lightweight quality than Lord Lloyd Webber may want you to hear. But, it's a well-produced disc, and if you're a Lloyd Webber fan, or a devotee of the modern pop-opera, how can you live without this cast recording?"
3,STOP!!!! You're buying the wrong version,"Phantom of the Opera is a wonderful and beautiful music, but DO NOT buy the London version. Michael Crawford is awful as the Phanton; seek out the Original Toronto Canadian version, which features Colm Wilkinson as the the Phantom instead!!THAT version is well worth your money!"
1,"Well, what CAN you expect?",I saw this live on Broadway with Hugh Panaro and I saw the recent movie. LOVED both. But this is not only in boxy sound but badly cast. The Christine mumbles too much and the Phantom sounds nasal and weak. I returned this purchase.
3,Great music but cut as only 1 song.,"Love the music and voices are wonderful, but each act which is one cd for act 1 and 1 cd for act 2 are ""one song"". You can not skip to different ""songs"" because it is cut as one act, which is ok if you just want to sit and listen to each act as you would hear it watching the show. You can't just skip to next song, think of it like an old cassette tape where you have to fast forward to find your favorite song."
4,Phantom of the Opera,"I was very pleased with this purchase. It arrived in a timely manner and was in great condition as promised in the description I read before purchasing. All in all, I have always been pleased with purchases that I have made on Amazon."
5,PHANTOM OF THE OPERA,I LOVED ALL OF IT. IT IS VERY INTENSE. I SAW IT LIVEON STAGE AND THE CD IS JUST LIKE THE PLAY.
1,Wishing That You Never Wrote This Show,"This show sucks. Wait, it doesn't just suck, it blows. The music is bland, except for perhaps the over-done ""Music of the Night,"" and Andrew Lloyd Webber has never made me hate him more, mostly because this show is one of his better works. ""Whistle Down the Wind,"" and ""Sunset Boulevard"" are far worse than this one. Our friend Sir Lloyd Webber hit his peak after ""Evita"" and then just started to write crap...and more crap...and more crap....This show tries to be deep and tries to be many things, but the plain fact is that it is severely overrated and point blak: STUPID.p.s. Sarah Brightman sucks."
4,Gotta love it!,This is a really great recording. However I have to say that Sarah Brighton and Michael Crawford aren't the best Christine and Phantom I've ever heard. I'm a fan of the 2004 San Francisco Cast with Brad Little and Lisa Vroman. They just don't sell recordings of that. But if you are looking for the original this is it. And it's VERY well done. It's Phantom.
2,SOMEWHAT OVERRRATED.,"I've seen the show and own the cd, and frankly, I don't think that it is a good show . Mushy, overblown music, and a trite story. The special effects were good! Actually, the performances on this cd are excellent. Give the singers credit-they didn't have much to work with. But, for a positive comment, well, the special effects were good!"
2,Wonderful in SOME ways,I loved the music and performers. I read all the reviews before I recently bought it. I wish someone had told me how bad the audio recording was because I cannot play it again! It has been miked in the orchestra and you have to have your finger on the volume in order to enjoy it at all. You can barely hear some of the singers but you go deaf listening to the orchestra. Too bad. I will have to find another recording....
5,Michael Crawford + Sarah Brightman = An Incredible Show!,"Phantom of the Opera has to be one of my favorite musicals that I have gotten to listen to over and over again. I was lucky enough to see the show (not with SB and MC) back in 1992, but when I listen to the CD to the original London show, it is just so much better.Sarah Brightman is incredible as Christine. I don't think that there is anyone else who has the range that she has. She is truly flawless.Michael Crawford. Wow. Let me just say that his voice is that of an angel. If there's an Angel of Music, it is him. Whenever I heard him sing, my heart just melts. Music of the Night is just wonderful. I feel like I am actually there with him. That is how powerful his singing is.The rest of the cast is wonderful as well, but SB and MC stand way out.If you are thinking about buying the soundrack to Phantom, buy this one! These two performers will truly blow you away."
4,Worth buying,"I first saw The Phantom of the Opera movie version, and was not very impressed with the music. I decided to give one of the original cast soundtracks a go, and I did not regret it.I only wish I saw this version on stage, because this flies high over the movie. I liked all the songs much better with this cast.When I first heard Micheal Crawford sing, I literally felt goosebumps. His voice is so pleasent and has a wonderful tone. A bit nasaly in the higher notes, but not enough to bother me at all.Sarah Brightman has a wonderful voice, but with so much vibrato that it was very difficult to understand the lyrics. However, her range is incredible. I was very impressed by that. I adored her version of ""Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again"". It made me feel pity for Christine for the first time.Overall it was worth the buy, and has now got me hooked on this musical."
5,Michael Crawford will forever be the best Phantom!,Canadian Phantom better? Peter Karrie is horrible! He doesn't even sing... He just makes noises! Buy the original London cast recording... I know that you will enjoy it over any other cast recording!
5,Phantom is the best!,"This is the best of the best. It is two CD's of the actual play, exactly as it is performed. I've seen the play 8 times, and before I ever saw it for the first time, I bought the cassette version and listened to it several times to familiarize myself the best I could before I saw the play. It helped a lot for me, but don't worry if you don't get the chance to do the same thing. After years of listening to the music and watching the play, I never get tired of it. I'm going again this July in Atlanta. I've seen many different main players in the various times I've seen it but never Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman, who are the original cast and who perform on this CD. Don't pass up the opportunity to own this - it's one of a kind."
4,Masterpiece but....,"I adore this production but have 2 issues. First, Ms. Brightman's lyrics are barely intelligible in many sections and I needed to refer to the libretto to understand her. Other ""Christines"" have done better. Second, the volumn ranges from barely audible to ear-splitting. I had to manually adjust the sound as I listened. Who was the sound engineer on this production? They should have fixed this while remastering the original recordings, they have the technology.Otherwise, a wonderful work."
5,THE BEST MUSICAL OF ALL TIME!!!!!,"Michael Crawford is the ONLY Phantom in my book, he has the passion, range, and utter pure perfection for this role!!! Sarah Brightman is fantastic, although her vibratto may be very fluttery at times and sounds like she has a glob of spit in her mouth at points, she does Christine better than anyone else I've heard. This is an absolute MUST HAVE if you like musicals. Don't even bother with the movie soundtrack version, get this one because it contains people who can actually sing without the need for post production pitch correction*cough* Gerard Butler *cough* BUY THIS VERSION OVER ANY OTHER THAT HAS OR WILL BE MADE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Phantom is great,"I bought the full CD of Phantom of the Opera, original cast, and it is great. Have been enjoying it frequently. Two full CD's of all of the songs. Price was right!"
5,The best that Andrew Lloyd Webber has done yet.,"Speaking as an actress,(and a 16 year old with bad spelling), This is one of Andrew Lloyd Webber's best musical yet. And a great example of the composers of our modern age. Even though some may say that it is repetitive and obnoxious, but that's part of the charm of our time. Micheal Crawford and Sarah Brightman are the perfect pair for the 'Phantom' and 'Christine' roles. Steve Barton is also wonderful as the ""handsome, dashing young nobleman, 'Raoul'"". This soundtrack is the next best thing that being there live. You'll love it."
3,dissapointed,"I thought that it was good.But there are just some songs good.The rest...Although many people enjoy it very much.But I think it's not ALW's best work.Also the lyric is BAD.It has nothing to do with the charaters.And I don't like Michale Crowford(hope that I spelled right)'s vioce.I think he didn't fit the phantom's charater.And also I don't like Sarah Brightman in this album,though I like her in La Luna and other albums of her own. She didn't sing well and fit Christine.Roual is the only one I satisflied.And Carotte(is this spell?)is horrible!I can't stand her voice!"
1,They call this musical theatre?,"From a composer of bad musical scores comes his worst, by far. The repetitive, boring score is made worse by awful performances by Brightman and Crawford."
1,Commercial like mad,"I am a huge fan of musicals and have listened to musicals from the soaring Les Miserables to the quirky Avenue Q. And when I heard about the Phantom of the Opera hype that was forming among my friends, I gave Andrew Lloyd Webber a chance, I was unsuprisingly disappointed. Most of Andrew Lloyd Webber's recent musicals are so commercial.The songs are so glossy they are plastic and the songs just bang nails into one's head with their cheesiness.However, this only my own opinion, for I know that many have fallen into that trap that is the Phantom of the Opera."
3,"Good price, but defective cd","I think the music from Phantom is beautiful, and the cd is of high quality. However, I bought a slightly used version from vendor, and my cd had a scratch on it. I was disappointed for this, and not really pleased with my purchase."
4,Thrilled yet disappointed.,"I think the Phantom music itself is incredible. However, the condition of the CD packaging was a huge disappointment. The outside cover was scraped and damaged. The CD case cracked and broke when I tried to open it. I contacted Amazon and was promised a new case, yet never got it. I would use caution before ordering any music CD's again. MC"
4,Almost perfect,"As a PHANATIC, this double box set is a must-have. I must say that the box is cute, it has the complete libretto (with ALL dialogues)... all inside a little cute box.I used to have a 80' double K7 set, given by my aunt when she saw the Phantom for the first time back in 90'. The main difference is that those K7 had the COMPLETE DIALOGUES, with NO cuts. And these CDs do not have little dialogues... but it still worths buying."
4,Must appreciate Opera to enjoy,"I felt it was a ""must have"" after seeing the play live and I enjoy most of it. However, I find myself having to listen to it alone, because I'm told you need to have a like and appreciation for Opera in order to like it. I would not buy this as a gift for someone who has not seen the play or you don't know for sure likes Opera."
5,ATTENTION: don't listen to all the other people,"attention, attention, please listen to me. This is a great sountrack that stares the greatest performers of all time. Michael Crawford, Sarah Brightman and Steve Barton who are the three main characters of the show.I've seen this show about 3 times. It's beautifully staged and the music is absoultly beautiful. I've watched the movie, Gerard butler does not count as the Phantom. Crawford does! Emmy sorta states Christine,but brightman is better. You may recall a certin death of Steve Barton but he's very good as raoul. I'm in love with all their voices. This is beautifully well done. Music by Andrew LLoyd Webber. Well Done. Everyone! This is now the longest broadway show in history! It has been all over the world. I've heard only this version. and the cannadian version. This has had 7,468 performances on broadway, never left. Buy this beautiful soundtrack and go see the show. Its' beautiful. Well done Mr.ALW.SignedJ.S (Jack Sparrow former pirate)"
5,thank you once again Mr. Webber,"This is a beautiful soundtrack for a beautiful show. ive seen it live, and to be honest i prefer Howard McGillin as Phantom over tje original, although he is still amazing. I love him in All I Ask of You (Reprise)"
5,THE BEST,This CD is absolutely fantastic. I listen to it 24 hours a day; I love it. Micheal Crawford is wonderful as the phantom; I went to see the show in broadway recently and the show just wasn't the same without him! My ears have become accustomed to his fantastic voice so it is nearly impossible for me to be impresed by any other! I love this CD and recommend it whole-heartedy for anyone.
5,Phenomenal!,"The only negative comment I have for this set is it isn't a complete recording (akin to the complete ""Les Mis"" recording that's available). I wasn't at all a fan of musicals until I saw this performed in London. After that, I was hooked. This musical--and the performances on this CD set--is absolutely wonderful. Buy this set and the complete symphonic recording of ""Les Mis,"" sit back, and prepare yourself for hours of listening pleasure!"
5,Never to be outdone!,"The music of The Phantom of the Opera is the most moving music I have ever heard. Lloyd Webber is a genious and made an excellent story into a romantic, sensual, chair-gripping musical. I know I shall never forget the days I saw Phantom, and I hope everyone has the chance to see it sometime."
4,A Musical With a Great Score,"The Phantom of the Opera is one of the best musicals ever written. The people who have said that the score is repetitive don't realize that Lloyd Webber has used leitmotifs, which any lover of opera will know of and appreciate. The only bad thing one can say about this recording is that it is heavily cut, hence the missing star, but at least the record company has given the entire libretto. The performances are all very good, especially Michael Crawford. In all, this is an outstanding musical recording."
3,The cliche intro to Broadway,"A good show overall. Motives that stick in your head and a poignant story line. This is the ultimate introduction to Broadway. Big, flashy, and easily digested by those who have yet to develope a taste for nuance and, dare I say it, talent. I recommend this for anyone getting their foot in the door as a lover of musicals."
5,Phantom of the Opera CD- 1986 London Cast,Great CD! Sarah Brightman and Michael Crawford along with others make this a truly enjoyable experience! Hooray Andrew Lloyd Webber!
5,A Work of Art...,"I had the privilage of seeing this show when it was in Portland, Oregon last summer on this very day. Afterwards, I bought this CD and relived all the magic of that fantastic production. It's a magnificent celebration of music. Michael Crawford has come so far and is fantastic; Sarah Brightman has quite a range and does a beautiful job.""And you'll live, as you've never lived before""Great for broadway fans, jolly good."
4,Beautiful but not the best,"Don't get me wrong, I love the Phantom of the Opera, but during a recent visit to London I got a chance to see Les Miserables. It was incredible!! It almost blew the Phantom out of the water. I now have a new favorite. If you have a chance to see two shows, see Les Mis and Phantom, but if you can only see one see Les Mis. You won't be sorry."
5,THE BEST CD EVER!!,"this is the best CD I have ever bought. I have seen the play 2 times, and the casts were good, but nowhere NEAR as good as the cast on this CD. This CD really is worth EVERY penny! Michael Crawford sounds so....evil, and sad,and powerful and you really believe that he really loves christine, even though he is so ugly, and deformed (the phantom, not Michael Crawford). the best part of the CD, of corse, is Ms. Sarah Brightman. She sounds sooo much like christine! the play really was written for her voice!!! This CD really is the whole play, not parts like some CDs are, and the sound is REALLY good, you feel like you really are in the opera house, or in the phantoms chambers, or wherever. IT IS SOOOO GOOD!"
5,AMAZING! Thank you AMAZON!,"This CD set just blows me away. It even has stage directions in the liner notes, and PHANTASTIC (:-) ) pictures. The sounds you hear is like watching the performance with your eyes closed. I LOVE IT! If you want a phantom CD, get this one first. I got the highlights first, but it didn't have the lyrics, but this one does. So, i HIGHLY reccomend this CD. :-) Hope this helps!"
5,A perfect companion to your playbill from the show,"No other broadway show has captured me like Phantom. Having seen it in NY and SanFran, and owning the soundtrack just brings back many memories. Powerful music, Sarah Brightman's starring role - she's got an INCREDIBLE voice.....perfectly matched with Michael Crawford.....part of my permanent collection....sometimes I just have to put it in the car on my commute and listen to the auctioneer starting the bidding on lot 666 :)"
3,The first...........isn't as good as I used to believe,"My parents brought me up on this the Original Broadway Cast CD of Andrew Lloyd Webber's Phantom, but after listening to the Original Motion Picture Soundtrack I've come to realize that the latest movie cast record is a lot better sounding vocally than this version. Sarah Brightman has quite the annoying tone quality and the Phantom hardly shows any emotion in his voice, unlike the silver screen version. C'mon folks, listen to both and you'll hear it too."
1,Expectations that weren't fulfilled,"I can't BELIEVE that THIS is the recording that those who bashed the movie keep asking people to buy! I've never heard a musical being sung with so little emotion and passion. Pretty it is but also detached, boring and bloodless. Even Michael Crawford's fans admit that THIS is not his best, far from it. Why this recording is rated so highly I'll never understand - talk about OVERRATED because it was the first! Sarah Brightman is a mediocre opera-wannabe who can't act to save her life, Michael Crawford was a 100 times better live.... The orchestra lacks fullness, faster tempi (Yes, that's plural) and the conducting is subpar. Buy the Canadian recording or the movie-soundtrack instead. Just because it was the first doesn't mean it's the one and only."
1,Overrated and bloodless,"Yes, I've seen the show and was blown away. And as this is the only studio-recording available (The movie IS different) I bought it and it was just boring. The performances were lifeless and boring, the singing bloodless and meanigless. As much as Crawford is revered, SO WHAT? His falsetto and nasal timbre is annoying, is white-sounding voice is like chalk on a blackboard to my ears. Mind you, enjoy him for all I care. I sure as hell prefer the new cast on broadway. This is overrated beyond belief."
2,Um...I dunno...,"IMHO the sound of this isn't as good as the movie-soundtrack. Plus I can't understand a word Miss Brightman is singing, she sounds like she has hot marbles in her mouth. Crawford sounds fine but lacks passion and madness. Steve Barton is wonderful. But the orchestra pales when compared to the movie-soundtrack, as does the boxy sound. I didn't like it and don't understand the hype."
1,Mess up the Phantom ---> Awful recording,"I love POTO in all its interpretations. I love the ALW musical. But the OLC cast does nothing for me. Every time I hear Crawford's nasal, whiny voice I want to bang my head against the wall. Brightman's ""acting"" is non-existant and the passion was left out completely. Buy the Canadian CD with Colm Wilkinson, the original Swedish recording or the movie-soundtrack. But skip this sterile ""performance""...."
4,Andrew Lloyd Webber's Phantom!,"Sarah Brightman is wonderful, the music is fantastic. This is the full, original recording and is great for phantom fans. I've always loved The Phantom of the Opera, first having read the book and then seeing the play. If you liked the book, I'm sure you'll like the music. It does differ from the book in some instances."
3,"I like Phantom, but the San Fransisco Cast is better","Lisa Vroman FAR, FAR outshines Sarah Brightman (not that she's horrible or anything) as Christine, the Phantom's protege. But overall a good CD, even if the actual compositions get somewhat trite by the end, it really is a good musical. The only problem is that the San Fransisco cast doesn't have a recording available. (hint, hint :-) (but Lisa Vroman does, in which she performs 2 songs from Phantom)"
3,"""Phantom"" is cool!","This recording is good, just good. The singers could've been better. I think Sarah Brightman was only picked because back then, she was married to Andrew Lloyd Webber. Michael Crawford is ok, but Steve Barton could have been replaced with a better guy. And can you hear Meg at all? I never heard her during the whole recording. Overall, it was a cool cd. When was ""Phantom"" never good?"
4,"A little pricey, but well worh it.","This is an excellent CD set. It does seem expensive, but it comes with a script of the entire play. After seeing this performed in London in May, 2000, I personally felt that the woman that played Christine on the CD (Sarah Brightman) missed the original concept of Christine. (At the recent performance in London, ""Christine"" did an outstanding job, I'm sorry I can't remember her name.) It seems as though the character of Christine should be played as a very modest opera performer, however Brightman almost overplays the character. She sings with too much confidence (sounds odd, doesn't it?) but if you read the book by Gaston Leroux, you may understand better what I am talking about. Other than that, this is an excellent addition to your CD collection, especially if you can't make it to a performance of ""Phantom."""
4,Great recording,"The voices and recording quality are quite good. The music is not my personal favorite, but I know that it is very appealing. You definitely walk out singing the themes."
3,Over Rated,"I am probably one of a few who don't like The Phantom of the Opera. I found it pretensious, dull, overdone and self indulgent on the part of Andrew Lloyd Weber. The sets, costumes and effects are truely dazzling. And there are some genuinely beautiful numbers in it. However, I found it far too long, much of the music could have been halved and the story not affected,(proven by the very effective and much shortened Vegas production!) and I thought Michael Crawford irritating, his singing voice affected and mannered, and entirely unnatural. Not only in this show, but his concerts and CD's as well. Just listen to the soundtrack of Hello Dolly and you hear his natural voice. It's not the same as what he sings now.A toss up with Rent as to which is the most overrated musical in history."
4,Islamic Pakistan 1960s,"(From another's review): Full title: ""Renaissance of Islamic Culture and Civilization in Pakistan"", by Dr. A. Rauf; published by SH. Muhammad Ashraf, Kashmiri Bazar; Lahore; 320 pages; August 1965 (1st ed.).This fascinating book, a pioneering attempt in the field, stretches to 13 chapters, the first 5 being devoted to a background presentation of the foundations and fundamentals of Islamic culture and civilization. The main story begins with chapter VI which narrates the way Islamic culture is affecting the home life in Pakistan. [Apparently, a shorter edition (130 pages) was published about 1974 (possibly with the first 5 chapters being excluded).]"
1,Not useful in the 21st Century School,"This book reads like a budget 101 book. If you have ever managed your own bank account before, there is no need for the book. With the way school finance is managed by business managers, a principal never sees the bank statement or is even able to get close to transferring funds around. This book would only come in handy for a school that does not have a financial system in place."
4,Verrry nice,"Its a nice belt. The black paint is still on there and ive worn it several times now. But we'll see what happens, probably normal wear and tear with the black paint. Id recommend it if you wear belt buckles."
4,Nice and BLACK,Excellant price...nice belt. And some folks have mentioned this is synthetic leather and that is correct. Not an issue for me since I consider myself rather earth friendly. What really makes this belt stand out is the BLACK color versus the typical chrome studding.
2,cheap materials fail fast,"The belt was sent and received in good order, but the belt itself is already coming apart. the holes are stretching and tearing. I do not have high hope for this belt. I will not be ordering another."
2,Not as high quality as I first thought.,"This belt is nice because of the sewn edges, that has keep it from deteriorating completely... but the holes in the belt need some re-enforcing.Using any belt buckle (other than the standard one that came with it), the holes stretch and rip... if you have a custom belt buckle, you'll know what I'm talking about."
3,decent,for the price it is acceptable.it was chipped in some places... but not a big deal. not very noticeable.the size seems a little smaller then listed.
1,It was nicer in the picture,"Its way to shiny and the paint is chipping away on it after the first time he wore it, ugh i hate it i do not suggest you buy this belt."
5,Fun,This CD is fun and educaitonal. If you are a fan of Reader Rabbit you will enjoy this CD too. It is educational and keeps your interest. It arrived in a timely manner and in good condition.
4,Reader Rabbit,"It took me a second to figure out how to personalize this, the first cd is the best it really makes my kids think. The second one to me isn't as good but still a great tool."
3,fair at best,"this slicer is almost big enough but not quite, the workmanship is fine but the blade guard is to thin and product gets stuck on lip of blade.poor design very hard to clean.lastly the value is just not here for another $100-$150 full size 10-12"" slicers are available elsewhere."
4,"Overall, good. Pain to Clean.",I've been using the Chef's Choice 662 for about 6 months now. The product is not bad. It consistantly works and works well. The only negative attribute about this slicer is how difficult it is to clean: it takes a good hour to give it a good cleaning at the end of the day of slicing meats.
4,Good but not the best album,"Like i said; it's my opinion, i liked the sounds of it,but i was missing something. i liked ""Lonely Grill"" better. that's why i rated it for 4 stars en not for 5.Greetings,Ingrid"
3,very small mortar and pestle,I didn't realize how very small it would be but the price was such that I cannot really complain.
3,"Does the job, sort of...","A little small but does what is necessary. It actually is round, not hexagonal. So that is somewhat false advertising."
4,"cute, functional and cheap","this is a good product, the only thing is that it's really small, like 1 inch high or 1 and a halve, and maybe I didn't read the instructions where they said the size so I expected something bigger.still very usefull for small things and it was very cheap too"
1,Weak Pestle,It's smaller than I expected and it was hard to get all the crushed pill powder out of the bowl. Also pestle broke in half after about a month of twice daily use.
1,not a good choice,"My porcelain mortar arrived in two pieces, and the pestle is too small to use with anything else. I will try another product, with better luck, I hope."
1,No QC/QA at HIC mfg or shipping!? Wtf??,"The first mortar and pestle I ordered arrived DOA: the mortar was in three pieces. I returned it to Amazon who replaced it with one that was cracked and even the glaze didn't cover the crack. Didn't return the second one. I have better things to do with my time than paddleboard-ball back and forth to the UPS store. I took some pix of the second mortar, but there isn't a way to include any here, and this POS isn't worth the effort of a video review. The people at HIC apparently have little or no quality control/assurance, nor does their shipping department.I've since found a nice little mortar and pestle at a local kitchen store where I also met a very cute and knowledgable sales lady. Silver linings can occur in the most unexpected places."
2,it was smaller than what I had expected.,It was smaller than I expected and I thought that it was very fragile.Still i think it is good enough for grinding spices.
4,Pill Masher,It is a bit small for anyone with big hands but does what I need. I have a small dog and need to pulverize his medication pill. This does the job my only reservation is the texture of the pestle retains some of the powder. It might be better if all surfaces were smooth
4,Tiny but it works,"This tiny mortar and pestle is not for someone with big hands. You can only do a small amount of quick grinding but that's the beauty of it. I like that it fits nicely in the corner of my silverware drawer and doesn't take up space in the cupboard. If you want to do more crushing/grinding at a time, I suggest getting the bigger size."
4,Small Mortar and Pestle Review,"This small mortar and pestle works very well for grinding small objects such as pills that are too difficult to swallow; however, the pestle may be a bit too small if you have medium to large sized hands. A slightly larger pestle that is big enough to protrude farther outside the mortar would be preferred. With the exception of the small pestle, this is good item that is well made and sturdy."
3,Good size,"It works alright. I've used better pestles, but it is a perfect apartment size. I tried to grind up some red pepper and it didn't work that good. But I'm sure it would do better if the pepper hadn't been so flaky."
5,Love the small size,I needed this to grind my cat's pills. The small size allows me to keep it out where it's handy. Good for small amounts of herbs as well.
3,Excellent two pack,"The description for this ""two pack"" is a bit misleading.... One picture shows two black batteries, another shows a silver one in it's package. This is essentially a pair of the two silver batteries shown in the second picture. To me, the color doesn't matter. Even though they are listed as high capacity, they are the same size as the OEM batteries. Sometimes higher capacity batteries are larger than their lesser capacity cousins. They have been performing as described, and I am pleased with the purchase."
1,Brings little to the table,"The book, a broad, shallow technical description of the Coalition armies is intended as an economical alternative to acquiring a number of more specialized works. Assuming there is an audience for undetailed technical descriptions, the next question is how well does it do what it sets out to do? The answer regrettably is not very well. It appears to be mostly a compilation of many of the more common and accessible secondary sources out there. Since most of these secondary sources are undefinitive and oft times contradictory, the test of the Handbook is how does it resolve such situation. The answer appears that it simply goes with one source or another, and there appears to be little ambition to do better than that. Thus the Handbook offers undefinitive information, economically. And it is rather pricey..."
5,Definitive Guide,"I recommend this book to anyone starting on the road to DocBook. Not only is it useful for the new user, like I was, it has a comprehensive reference section for all the elements of the DocBook SGML."
1,Not so great,I was expecting a little more fluidity. This couple reminds me of Lindy dancing south of the border. Does not make it seem simple or fun.
1,Fantastic book if you want to upgrade your 486,I bought this book expecting to find some useful information about how to upgrade my PII. It barely acknowledges that PII'S exist. My advice is if you want a good book that covers all the bases thoroughly buy Scott Mueller's UPGRADING AND REPAIRING PCs
5,Cooking with Stevia,"Although stevia can replace most or all of the sugar in many recipes, it doesn't take up the volume of sugar or brown while baking. This book tells the tricks of making your favorite recipes healthier. One example is this. Since cakes don't brown as they would with sugar, recipes are also given for stevia-sweetened icings to cover the cake - only for appearance's sake, of course. lolSince stevia has no calories and doesn't mess with blood sugar levels, it was great to find a book that tells how to make cookies, cakes, and other treats that are better for your body.From muffins and yogurt to jams and salad dressings, you'll find ways to naturally sweeten everything on your table."
4,great sounding recipes,"The only problem I ran into with this book is the specific wording of ""green stevia extract"" and ""stevia extract powder"" which are the primary sweeteners used in the recipies. You cannot find products in the stores with this specific labeling so it left me wondering what to use/ buy. The stevia ""powder"" IN THE RAW, does not list it's ingredients as either of those, nor does a liquid form (which I thought might be ""extract"". I couldn't find green stevia products at all. Some other stevia products on the market are actually mixed with sugar, so not useful for those with diabetes, only for calorie- counters."
2,"Two and a half stars, actually","I had high hopes for this book, but I found that I've had to tinker with the amount of Stevia in the recipes quite a bit. Unfortunately, as is the case with most artificial sweeteners, they tend to make the final product taste either bland or bitter. I like Stevia the best of all the artificial sweeteners I've tried, but I still think sugar in smaller quantities makes a better finished product. The variety of recipes wasn't that great, either."
3,Stevia Sweet Recipes: Sugar-Free Naturally!,Book has some useful baking info and stevia info. I will try some of the recipes. However some recipes do not work well if you are hypoglycemic due to the added fruits and or fruit juices.
3,Stevia -not so sweet recipes,"This is not a bad cookbook, but it is a lot of work to make most of the dishes in it. The recipes are very homey and old fashioned. I also found out that I don't really like the taste of stevia, so that doesn't help either."
2,Recipes are not sugar free,"I was very disappointed in this book. Approximately 80% of the recipes contain sugars in the form of fructose from fruit or vegetables. Apples, oranges, carrots, corn, onion, dates, cherries, bananas, etc. are all high in fructose. I guess I was hoping to see more recipes not containing any sugars."
4,"If it's not jazz, what is it?","So the last two albums have most certainly been jazz - another level of jazz, but still jazz. But what is this that we have here? We have all the elements of jazz -- thrown in with all the usual elements that the boys and girls and whatevers have been known to throw in, but this time what comes out is an insane abstraction into the world of sound art. Perhaps its most concrete moment is in one of the greatest abstractions of all, the rewind song, <<. I recommend buying this just to see what its all about, but get their other albums first."
1,did anybody even watch this show,"p just don't get it we don't wanna see, hear or smell you or your son anymore. I'm glad romeo was cancelled also this cd sucks you gotta be retarded to buy this."
1,ROFL~!!!!!!!1111111111111111111oneoneoneone,PHUQ LIL HO-MEOHES GARBAGE LOLK!LP!LP!PL!LP!OLL!O!LLLLLLLLL!Who would actually buy this piss? ANYONE WITH A RIGHT MIND WOULDNT LOLOL
5,Great Product,Had a friend give me his old 1st Gen Kindle but didnt have the charger. This one works perfectly. Now i have two good batteries and I dont have to charge the Kindle daily. Product is sturdy and it is from Amazon with the Amazon logo on it.
3,Can you make it cat proof?,"The power cord does what it is supposed to do, which is supply power to the Kindle device to recharge the battery. For that I give it 5 stars.However, my cat chewed my first cord just before I was leaving for a long trip, and that necessitated the old ""fix it with duct tape"" ploy. However, that didn't work very well. So I had to subtract a couple of stars for failure to foresee that many readers have cats.If you could make the device cat proof, I and my Kindle would be eternally grateful!"
1,Wrong item;no service,"I pulled the cord for my Kindle from the wall too fast when leaving a hotel and arrived home with the bottom plug from the cord missing. I tries to order a new cord. The one I was sent did not work on my Kindle.I returned it with a diagram of the rectangular plug my Kindle cord required and a request for replacement with a cord that would work on my Kindle. I have had no response. Usually Amazon is very consumer friendly, but I have been without my Kindle for two months now and I miss it."
3,Kindle Replacement Power Adapter,"Customer Service representative Holly said she would refund the added charge to ship via overnight mail. I do not believe I received the refund. Otherwise, service was courteous."
3,Kindle Power Adapter,"Pros -Charges the Kindle quickly (although this is more a property of the Kindle itself)It's white - this helps to differentiate it from the brazillions of other charging devices cluttering my life.Cons -Metal pin is fragile - don't put too much force on the connection pin to the Kindle. It's easy to snap off and not as easy to repair. Hence - me writing this review of a replacement charger in the first place...Summary -It's a no frills charger, and it does ithe job well."
4,Kindle Original AC Adapter,"Myself you can't go wrong with ordering the original adapter for the Kindle. Yes, there are others out on the market, but for a home AC adapter, this is what I think is best. It's the one that Amazon makes, has a long cord and you know you're getting the right product. Yes, they were on backorder but now they're in. I ordered an two extra to keep on hand for those ""just in case"" scenes."
2,Can't believe I had to order this!,"I can't believe I have had to order a replacement power cord! Mine still works fine, but it has crumbled apart so that there are bare wires showing. Come on! Don't make them so cheaply next time!"
5,Get an extra one... it is worth it!,"At first I thought it was stupid to buy a second adaptor exactly like the first... but because I was taking my Kindle to work so I could read during lunch and on breaks (after forgetting to plug in my Kindle when going to sleep), I bought one to keep at work.I love having an extra now! Took one on vacation... got home late and didn't have to dig through my suitcase to find that backup Kindle charger so I could read myself to sleep. Instead, just plugged the Kindle in to the charger I had left by my bed.Now if Amazon would only come up with a car charger, I'd be set!"
1,qaulity as epected,"This is a low cost charger as expected. I wouldn't suggest it, you get what you pay for. The power rating is low and the plastic used is low quality. I suggest a higher quality charger such as:Rapid Wall / AC Charger for the Amazon Kindle 1 - Gomadic Brand w/ TipExchange Technologycheers"
1,Amazon 1st Generation Kindle Replacement Power Adapter doesn't fit,"I have received and returned THREE Amazon 1st Generation Kindle Replacement Power Adapters BECAUSE IN ALL THREE THE PRONG WHICH INSERTS INTO THE KINDLE IS TOO LONG AND DOES NOT MAINTAIN CONTACT.Surely, there is some reason for all three being misfits.Fortunately, my original adapter works. I wanted a second for my office.Do either of the competitors' power adapters listed on your site fit?"
5,plug in,This is a great product and glad I bought two of them. One is for home and one for traveling after losing one while traveling. I like the added feature that it is a USB cord when I need that.
4,"Nice charger, but there are alternatives","I like my Kindle AC charger - it's elegant and compact. Unfortunately at the time I needed a spare charger, it was on indeterminate multi-week backorder.At that time, I went with theiGo Universal Wall (AC) and Auto (DC) Chargerwith iGo'sKindle Power Tip. That is working well.The (cheaper)iGo Universal Wall (AC) Chargerwill also work with the same Kindle Power Tip.Both of these are larger and less elegant than Amazon's Kindle charger. Now that the Amazon charger is available for immediate ship, these alternatives probably make less sense for normal use. However if you have multiple devices and only want to carry a single charger, the iGo chargers could still be useful."
4,Great product,At first i was hesitant in buying this product because am not sure whether the power adapter and charger is one and the same for my kindle. Until finally i took the in ordering it and voila it's the same. I've been using it since the day it arrived.
1,First Generation Kindle Power Source,"There must be more than one power source for Generation One. While this looks like it should fit the Kindle, it will not plug into the unit."
1,Hunk of Junk,Cheap piece of junk -- plug wouldn't stay plugged into Kindle and refund took FOREVER and replacement I ordered NEVER came. Don't bother!
2,out of stock??,"I left my charger on the other coast on vacation. For some reason Amazon did not see fit to have the Kindle able to recharge from USB although this is very easy to do. So I order one here only to find they are out of stock and my much loved unit is likely to be on empty before I get it.What is the deal? Kindle is hyped to high heaven but Amazon hasn't bothered to set up to meet demand. My unit took nearly six weeks to arrive. Nor have they set up to meet accessory demand. Does Amazon want to be in this business or not? If they do then it is time to bring everything up to speed related to the unit.Frankly I find it addictive and I order even more books than normal now, which is a lot. I think Amazon could profitably give a free Kindle to moderate to heavy ordering customers and do quite well."
1,Wrong adapter!!,This was an emergency order - I had forgotten my adapter at home and was traveling. Who knew the stupid jack wouldn't fit my (I guess) 2nd generation Kindle? They should warn you about that...
1,Didn't need,"If the description of the Kindle had been more explicit, I would not have wasted the money on a second power adapter."
1,WARNING - UNAVAILABLE,Don't expect to get a new power supply from Amazon. You won't even get a rational response from customer service in response to inquiries/complaints about the lack of availability of necessary peripherals for a $400 device.
4,A brief review and recommendation,"The title track ""Reap the Whirlwind"" excels into the realm of sheer phenomenal ROCK, and would be a more well-known classic if it were more promoted or perhaps on a bigger label. That is unfortunate, because this deserves to be shining high up in the spotlight with all the other gutsy guitar classics and tremendous vocal performances. Highly Recommended!"
5,UK issue of snatch cd different to US issue but....,that doesn't stop that from being one cracker of a cd. the UK edition has 15 songs and 8 quotes from the film making a total of 23 tracks in all. the tracks are very cool the stranglers golden brown and 10cc's dreadlock holiday and overseer's supermoves being my faves but the cd as a whole is pucker. if there is one cd soundtrack you need to get this year is the one. one quick note the US tracklisting differs slightly in terms of running order i do believe in closing if you enjoyed the film (i know i did i saw it twice) you will dig the music on this disc.
4,Interesting...,"I bought this because I am a fan of Alejandro Escovedo and try to buy everything he records. And with Gurf Morlix producing it was all the more intriguing. This project,however, with Michael Hall & Walter Salas-Humara, is really for fans only as it probably won't entice anyone to become fans of any of the three... Better versions of most of these songs have been recorded by them (as solo artists or in other groups) previously."
3,Almost great -- but who cares,"After each member of this ""group"" established himself they came together to release this collection, part songs each wrote, part other favorites, all interesting arrangments. This record may not be for the fans of any of the previous bands, but it is for the fans of the songwirters, and more importantly, the fans of the songs.While working my death sentence in record stores, this was always one that I could refer a few fans of Americana to, and I never had a disappointed customer. Definitely not for the casual listener, this record will appeal to established listener of the country/folk/rock genre (if it even is one?) -- assuming you have the ears to catch the sublties of a few guys just making the best music they can for their own ears, and their own hearts.It's more than worth the spin, if you think that you're up to the challenge of being a listener instead of a consumer."
2,Three of a kind,"The Setters are Walter Salas-Humara, Michael Hall, and Alejandro Escovedo, three better-than-average songwriters who've had long careers in Austin, TX. All three are also afflicted by the ""everybody's a front man"" syndrome - that is, all three are colorless singers with distinctly un-charismatic presences who'd really benefit from group rather than solo settings. (But, y'know, there's that darned ego thing...) Hall's songs are lyrically quirky, and Salas-Humara and Escovedo are solid and competent, as always, but the Setters have as little personality and color as each of the component parts. Too bad."
4,A great Blues Band,"I was very fortunate to see ""The Mambo Brother's"" at Disney's, Pleasure Island. The most memorable song during the performance was ""In the Hips"". After purchasing the album, I found the music upbeat and lively. It will make it a great disk to add to your blues and jazz collections."
1,Chef's Choice 645 Slicer,"We shopped locally for the Chef's Choice 645 Slicer, but couldn't find one in-stock to inspect. After reading the factory description of the unit, we resorted to online ordering. When it arrived, we carefully unpacked it so we could examine it closely. What a BIG disappointment! The 645 had too much plastic in the construction which we had not been able to see in the photos we could find nor was it mentioned in written descriptions. It is a plastic device with a metal shell that is primarily for appearance. We repacked it and returned it to the vendor. This experience isn't free since we will be charged a restocking fee and shipping. Learn from our experience. See it before you buy!"
1,VariTilt 645 Slicer,"In the description about this slicer stainless steel is mentioned a lot other than the blade this unit is made out of mostly plastic."" VariTilt 645 Slicer"" There is no variable tilt to this slicer it 0 or 30 degrees so the word VariTilt is deception at best. I removed this slicer from the box and was highly disappointed with the way it looked plastic and more plastic. Have not used it yet so I can't comment on how it works. This thing is overpriced by a $100.00 stay away at the $379 price"
1,Disappointing set has more interviews than skits,"We ordered this set to see the best skits, not listen to endless droning on about the personal lives of the guys. We were very disappointed that there is no way to watch the skits without the interviews, and, on top of it all, the entire skits aren't even shown but frequently have the beginning or end cut off!"
4,Retrospective,"I really enjoyed seeing the old sketches, although some of the commentary was a bit forced and boring. John Cleese as a crotchety 92 year old was pretty lame. (I am a fan of most of Cleese's work.) It was a Christmas present for my teenage son, who LOVES it and has watched it over and over again, so it was money well spent. It's great to hear my boy singing the Lumberjack Song in German."
2,Disappointed Monty Python Fan,I rarely rate things I buy at Amazon because for the most part I'm always happy with what I get. This time I had to say something if for no other reason than to save someone else from purchasing this set and being disappointed. First off Amazon is COMPLETELY blameless. The set arrived on time as stated.If you're a Monty Python fan and like to remember the old skits and hope to be able to see them then DON'T buy this set. The skits are all cut up and shortened and bleed into totally unrelated skits. The interviews are convoluted and void of any REAL knowledge. After reviewing the entire set my opinion is that there is about one DVD's worth of value here if you combine all 6 DVDs and get rid of the chopped up scenes and skits and boring convoluted interviews. I would not pay more than $10.00 for this set or you WILL be dissatisfied.The Personal Best of Monty Python's Flying Circus
4,Monty Python's Personal Best,"The Personal Best of Monty Python's Flying CircusAs a huge Monty Python fan, I absolutely loved this collection. I just watched Eric Idle's bit yesterday and it was top notch hilarity of course. Even though my set was used it plays fine."
5,Another Great CD,Music is GREAT !!! I just love Tejano music. Emilio was Awesome when he was at the top of his Game..He still IS !!!
5,Hanging Folder Tabs,These Smead Hanging Folder Clear Poly 1/5 Cut Tabs fit my Pendaflex Folders perfectly. I'm so glad I found these. Delivery was fast.
4,Good product great price,These tabs are great. They are clear and tough. I use them to organize my folders. I either use the insertion tab on the folder or sometimes I prefer just to staple them where ever I choose on the folder to meet my needs.
3,Does what it's supposed to,"I got this for a GMC Safari to install an aftermarket stereo. I had to alter the install from what the instructions said because of the very shallow area I had to fit my radio, and you really need to pay attention to what part of the tabs to remove otherwise you may break off the one you need. It looks ok in the dash and holds the radio well enough."
2,Should be called PalmPilot: The Beginners Guide!,"If you are technically astute or computer literate this books rehashes information readily available in the manuals or on the web. The programming section, although well written, is strangely out of place in this book. Would have been ranked higher if it didn't claim to be the Ultimate guide but one for beginners trying to get the most out of a new platform.Good points:As with all OReilly books, well written and easily read.An excellent appendix of software. A good starting point for trying 3rd part apps.Inclusion of the CodeWarrior Lite which allows you to get your feet wet with Palm Development with minimal investment."
3,mainly for PalmPilot User and not developers,I bought this book thinking that it will teach me how to develop Palm Pilot applications but it is mainly devoted for a Pilot user and not a developer. I was disappointed because most of the things are in some sense intuitive. It devotes only one chapter to application development which is in any case available with all development kits.
3,PalmPilot: The Ultimate Guide with CDROM,"Book in great shape. I didn't realize it was an older book, but that's fine. I need all the guidance I can get."
3,Missed the itch,"I browsed this book before buying and decided against it. I am looking for a more technical reference/description of the device (""what's under the hood of this thing?""), not a rehash of the user screens, nor an anthology of palm-related web sites and neat applications. The companion Programmer's guide may be as close as I am going to get. Still waiting for the perfect book to be written/published."
4,Nice coverage,"Let me first say that I love the Larenim brand so the only reason I'm giving this foundation a 4 star rating is because the colour is too dark for me, even though this is their lightest shade. If the shade was just a little bit lighter, it would be perfect for me. I really liked the coverage and I only had to use one layer to get an even skin tone."
2,Nice but not Good,"As soon as I recieved this DVD my daughter and I were excited to start the class and we looked for the FREE POSTER mentioned at the time of purchase...But there was ""nothing"" so that brought my duaghter down, Any who we played the video and the steps are just right But too fast not good for beginners and the angle of the camera keeps switching from side view very confusing..If your daughter wants to to just have fun watching this? Good, If they are ballet ""beginners"" its frustuating too fast...I feel bad buying it because my daughter ended up crying."
3,good,"I received it quickly, it is a gift for my niece, so not sure how it is for havent given it to her yet."
2,Would not recommend,I dislike this product due to it being a cheaply made dvd. I would not recommend anyone to buy this dvd.
4,Learn to Ballet,This is the perfect DVD for our 4 year old who has been attending a ballet/tap class for about 3 months. I reinforces the basics which is what I wanted.
4,my little girl loved it,My little girl wants to be a ballerina and there are no lessons close by. this is a great way to get started she will watch it over and over and then she does the moves and tells us what they are called and she is only 5! probably not for older children it is fairly simple but fun.
3,Not too satisfied...,I wanted my daughter to learn ballet without having to go to a studio. She's a beginner and so I bought this. The lessons and movement are too fast. I would not call it an easy step-by-step because it can be very confusing. Good luck on finding a better one.
4,Birthday present for my younger sister...,I purchased this DVD for my younger sister as a birthday present. I watched it with her as she tried her best to follow the instructor's directions. So far she has used it four times this month. I would recommend this item for children over the age of 8.
3,Okay,"Not great, not terrible. My girls had so much fun with a DVD called Baby Dance, I decided to get some more dance videos for Christmas. They have not been terribly impressed, so I am basing this review on their reaction. They are 3 and 5. They have yet to make it through the end without getting bored. Sorry, it just isn't that exciting for them!"
5,My granddaughter loves this video,"After repeatedly checking out this video from the public library each time she visits me, I decided to purchase this video for her to have at home as well. She loves to practice her ""ballet lesson"" in front of the television and gives me ""recitals"" each time she uses it. She is five years old and loves all things ballet."
2,accurate but dull,"We bought this DVD for my 4 year old daughter who loves ballet. The Dvd does give good instructions but is very boring and slow. She lost interest before they were threw the second step and had to WAKE my mom and I up! So for true steps it is good, but it is not upbeat or lively... I can not belive my mom and I both feel asleep."
4,My daughter LOVES this DVD!,"My daughter is 6 and loves this DVD. It is well put together and great for aspiring ballerinas. Some parts move just a little quickly for young kids and now and then the camera angle goes from the front to the back which is something they need to do away with if they create an updated video at some point - if a child is mirroring the dancer and the angle changes suddenly, it can be confusing. But once my daughter had used the DVD a few times, she was able to catch right on to the moves. The teacher is very likable and does well connecting with her audience. I would recommend this DVD for anyone with a youngster who is developing an interest in ballet! Any youngster who wants to ""be a ballerina someday"" will want to practice every day, and this is a great way for them to get this practice. There is also a section on the DVD showing the lives of other ballerinas at all different levels. I think I might have enjoyed this part more than my daughter - LOL!"
2,no music,This DVD was a birthday gift for a 3 year old great grandchild who has natural musical appreciation. She loves to mimic dancing groups then repeat with her own version. The parents played the DVD and although they did not play the whole thing they tell me there is no music with the classes.What a disappointment; this little girl needs music with her instructions.Great Grandma and Grandpa
4,Nice beginning Ballet Class,"The teacher was clear in her instruction, and she also seemed to anticipate problems such as tired arms and posture. My daughter and I had a lot of fun doing this DVD."
3,Great for the price,My only issue is that the padding does not give the best seal. Riding in city traffic they're great. But on the highway they let in just enough wind to make you notice. I love the bag that doubles as a cleaning tool. And the straps are good too.
3,Comfortable eyewear!,"I tend to go through sunglasses pretty quickly. I have an average to wide face, and they fit well. They are comfortable riding glasses and deflect wind from my eyes very well, but they limit my periphrial vision slightly. While riding a motorcycle, I need to see everything I can. Not a bad buy, it's just tough to buy without trying on."
1,Software bundle is terrible,"After purchasing this book and reading a few chapters I was real excited about building a cluster only to discover the numerous errors and the software bundle included a complete waste. I really wonder if those who rated this book 5 stars actually tried building the cluster with the enclosed software?? The Perl scripts for populating the database are missing, the web pages are all wrong, the apache configuration is also wrong. Many of the cgi scripts do not work properly. I sure hope O'reilly does a better job of checking this stuff out before they sell it.If you're good a hacking and want a challenge this may be a good start."
1,Don't bother with this book,"I never thought I'd find an O'Reilly book that wasn't worth even a look, now I have. The errors are too numerous to count, the scripts do not work and the setup is ridiculous. Stick to the primers on the web, this book is a waste of trees. There are much better resources for beginners on the web. It is harder to build a cluster using the methods in the book (I've done a few and am always after easier ways) Now you know. (cross-posting to O'Reilly web site to save others the trouble)"
1,Old,"Much of the information in this book is out of date. In addition, because of the time sensitive nature of hardware environments, Most of the discussion about hardware is mute as well. Too much of this book covers information that anyone serious about building a cluster would already know before they picked it up. By now the 6.2 version of Red Hat Linux is old and not likely to be a good starting point for any installation. This book needs more networking configuration discussion. It might look like the only book out there but, try the web for more up to date resources."
3,Too much on building/not enough on using,concentrated too much on how to build a machine from scratch. he could have spent more time describing different uses of clustered machines (there is more you can do on them than just run long jobs). check out jolt.linux.com magazine on clusters much more informative on the 'using' side
5,Works great,"Its as speedy as any standard HD, i used it in a enclosure to make a small portable, i can say it is recominded"
1,Never worked,"Not sure what happened with this processor but I was unable to get it to work. Not something I did, I always take all necessary precautions when dealing with my computer. I am assuming it was because this processor was used."
3,"It's Okay, But Just Okay","Let's just put it this way, Mech Warrior 4 it's not. Microsoft needs to continue with the story they began in Mech 4."
1,Horrible Service,"This game is absolutly horrible. I have a Radeon 9600 PRO and an Athlon XP 1700+ cpu, 512 RAM, and other good stuff too, and this piece of junk doesnt work. There are no game updates, no tech support from MICROSOFT!, and none of the solutions listed at microsoft tech support make it run. It installs fine, and starts to run the game and then just stops. New drivers were unable to fix it and who knows if I can return it. I give it one star becuase it looked fun and with my RADEON video card Im sure it would have looked sweet too!"
2,"A possible ""Warning""","Seems like all the reviews for this game are good, but a word of caution. microsoft has come up with a new ""advancement"" in CD security, ""SafeDisc"". This came make MechCommander 2 unusable by many types of CD drives. They list some in the readme file... but by then you have already bought it and are out the cash. And the readme list is also incomplete. I hope microsoft plans on patching this soon otherwise I have a pretty nifty coaster for my drink. Wish I could play this damnable game and give it another good review, thanks a bunch billy boy."
1,Gotta Love Security Checks,"Well, I was looking forward to this game a great deal because I have enjoyed the first game alot. Unfortunatly due to a bug in the Microsoft security check to make sure that the cd is in the drive, I cannot play the game at all. They give no support on their web site and there is no sign of it being fixed. Don't buy this game unless you want an expensive coaster."
1,A True Gamer,"The Copy protection is SO GOOD that I couldn't even play it. Microsoft has really outdone themselves this time. I think as a buyer you are mistaken for a pirate and there is no help to be found if the game is not compatible with your CD-Rom drive. So be warned, this CD may not work on your system. It's about a 50-50 chance you are taking (or worse).When it comes to your money, don't gamble. Try another title."
1,Didn't even work correctly,"I would say I would have possibly enjoyed this video game but the version that I received was defective. I tried to get customer service from microsoft and that was problematic. Nothing on their website was useful and then I was forced to either pay money for support or call long-distance just to receive support with the warranty. Then after I spent time getting an account setup with them they said that there had been a number of defective cd's shipped. Then he said I could either return it or they could send me a copy in 3 plus weeks. Trust me, why buy this game if it may not even work correctly!"
2,Way over-rated.,"i am a huge fan of the entire mechwarrior series, so i expected to get some bang for the buck no matter what. wrong!the graphics are cool, but that's about as far as it goes.the game is hugely over-simplified compared to the sims, and i had more fun with the latest ""starcraft"" clone, even given the fact that i am way into the base concept.limited flexability, long load times, over simplified.spend good money on a real strategy game, and wait for the the jewel-case on this one."
5,Furios But Not Fast,"This game is an excellent game, it's just that it's graphics are so good, they slow down your computer."
1,Typical Microsoft Junk,"This game is probably loads of fun. I just wish I could get it to run on my computer. I meet the system requirements and I can get the game to load past the menu system and that gives me a problem some times since the game doesn't seem to respond to my mouse clicks. You need to have a computer that really exceeds the listed system requirements. You will also need to download all the patches that are out for it now from microsoft to get the game to work as well. Typicaly Microsoft Junk, just like the majority of thier other programs."
2,Too easy - very buggy,The campaign is too easy. The enemy AI is weak. The game crashed a lot for me.
4,Old but still good,"Was a blast from the past, but really worth the money to get my hands on this title once again. If your a RTS fan this is a game that you will love, even if the graphics are dated."
3,mech commander 2 needs more umpf...,"I played this games mission out in a week, about two hours each day...it would have been nice to have more campaigns right out of the box, or provide expansion packs for retail...I stopped assigning light mechs and sensor mechs during game play because it was just easier to play with the assault mechs and capture a sensor capable one and fix it up.Microsoft has the capital to develope these games better I think, when it comes to providing extended play...maybe starting over again on the same maps with varient missions and toughers AI's would help...I strongly think dounloading the player created missions is the only great aspect of this game because the create missions are from hungry gamers who know what everyone else is looking for in a game and to be able to create new missions is great...my only question is, is it possible to trade up Mech Commander 1 units to MC2?"
2,What a short game!,"This game will keep you on your toes the first time you play it, but it only took me 5 days to go through the whole thing! I tried to step it up one notch and go to normal dificulty instead of easy but I could not make it past the second level. Maybe I'm just not good enough. On a good note the game has tons of interchangible parts like rockets, lasers, autocannons, and sheilds that you can mix and match for every mission. If you have ever played the game Age of Empires, the game is a lot like that without the planting crops and building up your rescorses, just fighting and combat. So if you are looking for a game that will keep you entertained for a short while this is the game for you."
4,Shark Attack Lunch Box,"I ordered two different lunch boxes in the same visit to Amazon. This one took about a week longer to receive and is dented on an outside corner. It is a metal lunch box and overall a nice product. There were two DVD's inside that were both factory sealed in shrink wrap. One is rated ""R"" and the other ""PG-13"". I assume they're perfect, but inappropriate for the 8 year old shark-lover that I bought the lunch box for."
4,Great study book!,This book has a lot of information that is very useful for the HOAE test. I took the exam today and scored excellent on the test...and I am from GA. I saw where someone had posted that it did not help them and they were from GA. Would highly recommend this book!
5,cool sounds,A friend of mine brought this cd with him when he came to visit. Listened to it a couple times over the weekend and had to have it. Great cd. Unique sound. I think most people would enjoy it.
3,Street Gospels,"This album will appeal to a much larger audience than the previous albums have and the current singles will attract many more 14 year old girl fans. After an album as brilliant as ""Sounding a Mosaic"" its hard to know what to do; stick with that albums sound or go in a new direction? Bedouin incorporated some gospel feel to this album that personally, I just cant dig. It seems ""Street Gospels"" was made with more money is less time, the song writing hints this with some pretty bland material. With that said, I love Bedouin and I've been to at least five live shows since first seeing them at Bottom of The Hill(SF)...(and that was easily their best show). This isn't a bad album.In my opinion it just isn't as good as the previous albums.But I'll say this, BEDOUIN BRING BACK THE DUB!"
2,Not so good like the Sounding a Mosaic,"This cd is well done but is changing them sound, i dont like so much its really pop, i love the ""Souning a Mosaic"" cd! Please return to the sound of the old cds..."
4,Hands on Gnome Programming,"It is a instantly hands on guide on how to program for Gnome/GTK. Each topic is very well explained, with a lot of practical and independent examples, covering almost every GUI building block.For those who lacks more real-world code examples."
2,Too bad it contains mistakes...,"This book is informative, well designed and, in general, a good book.The only thing I did not like about this book is the errors that it contains and the fact that the publisher doesn't publish a list of errors. Sometimes the explanation says one thing and the code that goes with it says another. (ex: Take a look at page 27 (the code) and take a look at the explanation on page 28. It claims that if eventDelete returns TRUE, the window closes. The code says otherwise)Please put pressure on the publisher so that he corects the book."
3,should have been called a tutorial NOT a bible,"This book is a fast and easy intro to gtk and gnome programming. It contains large, complete examples which are good if you want to do what everyone else is doing. However, I'm trying to draw data and I need something better than calling gdk_gc_set_foreground(); gdk_draw_point(); 256 times for every data set.He uses a large number of gdk routines without providing any overview. The routines are explained where they are used but it's very haphazard. Most of the routines I need seem to be missing.The references for Gtk and Gnome widgets list functions, enums and signals for each but doesn't explain anything about them. Parameters and return values are only discussed in the text if they are actually used."
5,Great DVD for kids!,"This DVD comes with the following episodes: Franklin's big game, Franklin's mom, Franklin's float, Gee Whiz, Franklin, Franklin can't wait."
2,knowledge and well written,"A knowledge read and much research went into the writing. I personally bought two extra books to give to women who had asked about this book when I was reading it. As women are so overlooked, as it was in that culture, in the writing of the Bible as a whole, having emphasis placed on the importance of those who were mentioned was interesting. It would certainly be a good basis for a Bible study."
4,Women in the New Testament,St. James' ECW uses this book as the basis for monthly lessons. It's a good text. We also use the Scriptures citations and a lesson prepared by one of the women.
1,Too feminist for me,There was an strong underlying theme throughout that seemed very feminist and negative to me. It was hard to learn something about the women in the New Testament because I was too distracted by what seemed negative comments about the gospel writers being too androcentric and patriarchal. The statement that Phoebe was the first named deacon was misleading until I figured out that she was the first named in writing (Romans was written before Acts) but not the first deacon named (the first deacons ever named were in Acts 6). That's a long way to go to try to promote women deacons. Things like that I found disturbing.
5,Great Book,"While visiting St. Vincent Seminary, I bought this book after gaining an interest in women in the Bible from a class on Women in the Pilgrim Church. This by far is the best one I have found about the New Testament women. It includes very relevant scripture passeages and is not afraid to say some things others have been.I highly reccomend this book for anyone interested in the Bible, women of the Bible or their faith in general."
2,Joke Band,"Listen to this cd and notice the ""Dave Matthews"" imitaion voice. This clown used to play my frat at UGA and he was more about posturing and trying to pick up girls than his craft. No wonder you never got off the ground."
5,Historical Diving,I realy enjoyed Submerged. I found my self not being able to put the book down. Lenihan explains the importance of saving our submereged historical artifacts as well as those of other nations. I am a History Major as well as a Diver. This book has both of the two worlds. I would recomend this book to anyone interested in diving or history.
4,traesure found!,very interesting reading about underwater archeology and treasure hunting & the intrigue behind it all I could not put this bok down.
2,don't waste your money,I thought this would be a book about the underwater archeolgy in our national parks instead I got a book with the author going on and on about how great he is with all most no real information on the sites they are diving. I still have not finished the book.
2,waxing prosaic,the stories in and of them selves for the most part are interesting however a major drawback is that he can not write. he says he is waxing prosaic. and guess what he is absolutely correct. for a much better examppe of underwater adventures and vastly superior writing would be shadow divers. the writing makes this almost unfinishable however it is written at a grade 10 level so it doesnt take much time to blow through it. newmarket press should have insisted on a real writer to tell the story . this is truly a waste of very interesting material
2,Ironic,"For a book about technical communication, it doesn't communicate very well. It has a lot of fluff sentences and uses overly complex sentence structure (I suspect, purely to hide the uselessness of the sentence itself). A lot of the diagrams almost make things worse. The charts are often too wordy or don't connect very well with the rest of the text. It contains many pictures of people at meetings or looking at things intently. As adults, I don't think we need intermittent pretty pictures.Generally, it's painful to read. Every time the teacher assigns chapters to read, I become enraged at the very thought. This is the only textbook I've had for a writing class, though. Maybe they're all like this."
4,used but in good condition,"I ordered books for class a little late, but they showed up on time and in good condition. No pages missing."
3,Worthy Reading it!!,I had this book for the Techincal Writing Class.I do think that this book really does good job on giving guidelines and advices.I give 3 stars out of 5.
3,Ouch!!!!,"I ordered the saddle color, and it is a beautiful shoe, but most uncomfortable. I wear a size 8 narrow, and they are too narrow for me. I could have probably went up a half size, but I was afraid they would be to big in the heel area, because they slip up and down on one of my heels, so I placed one of Dr. Schols insole for heels in them, and it made it a little better. I punish myself by wearing these shoes, but only when it is for a short time. I do get a lot of compliments when I wear them for that short period of time."
3,Size incorrect,I wear a size 10 shoe this shoe fits like a size nine. Very uncomfortable to wear. I thought the sizing was compatible with other stiletto shoes.
2,Not true to size,"I think that these shoes are very sassy, but I ran into one problem ordering them online...they aren't true to their size. I always wear a 6 1/2 but after putting these on, my feet were asleep after about 10 minutes. Order wisely."
1,WARNING!!! Sunbeam will not repair or replace.,"I got this product for Christmas, and it broke after 6 uses. Grill plates will not open back up. Repair center informed me there are no replaceable parts, and to throw the unit away. They also told me warranty replacement was unlikely as Sunbeam does not usually honor warranty replacement.Buyer Beware!! While I actually really liked the unit. It appears the company is not backing the product.Anyone have any ideas for this pile of useless pouches I have??"
4,My 3rd Rocket Grill,I just ordered my 3rd Rocket Grill. I've had 2 earlier versions and loved the grill. The lid on the previous design kept cracking and w/o the lid you could not use it. The earlier versions gave me grill marks w/o cooking w/added fats. Foods come out moist. Great when cooking for two; clean up is fast. Will follow-up w/review after receiving newer model.
2,Shoddy workmanship,"I loved the concept of the grill and I managed to convince myself that the fact that burgers and steaks came out really dry meant they were less fatty and therefore healthier. I put up with the price and relative difficulty in locating of replacement bags, chalking it up to the cost of owning a niche item. Then, this week, the knob came right off. It sheared off at its base, rendering the built-in timer totally useless.That's it. After six months, this thing's going out with next week's trash. This could have been a great product but they screwed up too many of the little details."
4,Works great as an indoor grill,I have had this grill for two months and so far I am very satisfied. Everything I have cooked in it has come out tender and cooked to my taste. My only complaint is the cost of the cooking bags and the fact that I have been unable to find them at a local store.
1,Did not work,The grilling units did not close when food was inserted. Never had a chance to cook with it.
1,Don't be fooled by the glamor,"I got one argument. $14.99 parchment pouches.If you exclusively use this machine to cook, meals, snacks, what have you,you are going to run out of parchment pouches in less than 2 weeks.Limited size and lack thereof of reusablity for cooking multiple items without shelling moola for wax paper attached to cardboard handles makes this a waste. Not to mention, I feel it generates more pollution than other convience electric grills."
2,pricey,"the rocket grill is extremely limited in scope, and pricey. It did not grill potato slices in the time listed in the guide. but took almost three times as long. It does grilled cheese sandwiches very well. If I make 50 grilled cheese sandwiches in my remaining days, it will only cost $2.25 per sandwich to make them, as opposd to 0 in a skillet."
3,Good but food doesn't come out like the commercial....,"I was very excited to get this product after reading all the wonderful reviews. I cooked boneless chicken the first night, and was dissapointed with the look and taste. It didn't look as appetizing as the commercial. I knew that it could take a few times to learn the correct timing etc, so I have since made more chicken and pork chops in the grill. The pork chops were a little raw in some areas so I had to cook longer. This made the pork chops tough. The chicken came out better and was tender but still not as good as I would have expected. It's very nice to be able to clean up in seconds! I've never used anything this easy. I will continue to use my grill and get better results!"
1,worst thing i've ever owned,"got it as a gift, tried it a few times, mostly with chicken breasts...didnt cook evenly and they got all smushed in the bottom because of a little thing called gravity...save your money and just get a foreman grill..."
5,WONDERFUL:,Still cannot get over how easy and quick this unit is. It cooks to perfection. Think I will have to get more to give away as gifts.Excellent
2,Didn't work,"First I tried chicken breast. Half was overdone and half was raw. Then I decided to try something easy...grilled cheese sandwiches. I made four and all were only half cooked. I called the company and they agreed to send me a new one, but it was simpler just to take this one back to Wal-Mart. I didn't want to go to a lot of trouble if the next one didn't work. I'm going to look for another type."
5,Amazing~Super Fast~Great Meals~Love IT!!!!,I am so glad I took the risk of buying this NEW item with only one review at the time. It does what it says to PERFECTION! Great for singles or familys on the go. There is ZERO cleanup. You can come home starved and drop in a huge frozen chicken breast and in 8-9 min you have a healthy dinner. Think it's going to be a great weight loss tool. All the fat drips into the bottom of the bag. If there were 10 stars I would certainly give it. It even makes great grilled cheese sandwitches in 2 min. The deal that Amazon gives with free shipping and the $[...] promotion makes it a STEAL!
2,Nothing is perfect I guess.....,"The reviewers are all correct about how this thing ""grills"" anythingyou put in it quickly. However........and a BIG however for me......is that once you close the lid you are at TOTAL mercy of the grill...it is IMPOSSIBLE to see if it is overcooked..and the guide only helpsa little...it is far from accurate. I have had to regrill a couple of things..and I have had the displeasure of OVER grilling a couple of things so far..I am sure I could get it down to a science after a while..BUT..the biggest drawback for me is the odor that this thing puts out while you are grilling.. A very sickening ""new gadget"" smell. Like you need to cook a bunch of things in it before this smell quits ematingfrom the machine during the cooking cycle. It is bad enough for me to stop using it and try to find someone to give this machine to.2 stars....only because it DOES what it says it will do...sorry...but I have to tell it like I see it."
5,BIG SUPRISE FOR THE GOOD!!!,"First let me say that I was very skeptical having been disappointed so many times before and having a graveyard of unused appliances. I bought this at Bed Bath and Beyond and used the 20% off coupon to boot. This made the $80 plus tax a tempting value. I first tried hot dogs which I love on my barebeque. I used some reduced fat which usually don't come out that great. Well, to me and my wifes suprise they tasted better than on the grill!! Grill lines outside and moist and tender inside. The small amount of fat was in the collection lip on the bag below. Since then we have cooked sausage, chicken hamburger and pork and continue to be amazed at the taste, quick cook time and no clean up, thats right none!! Juat ahut and put away. We have had several cooking grills and several George Foremans and this wins hands down! Highly recommended"
2,Maybe I'm grill challenged,"I've tried three meals so far...1. 1 frozen chicken breast. - Turned out as a B+, it was juicy, but a little tough, which I attributed to it being frozen at the start.2. 2 defrosted chicken breasts done together - Turned out as a D. The grill squeezed the bulk of the breast to the lower part of the bag, overcooking the top portion and leaving the bottom raw.3. 2 large fresh ground lamb patties - Turned out as a D. The grill did the same thing here as with the chicken breasts. It deformed the patties to a thin portion which was overcooked on top, and a fat portion which was raw at the bottom.The vertical design of the grill I think has a problem with positioning the food properly for even cooking. I like to give new things the benefit of the doubt, and I might try to use this once again, but honestly it seems like a huge waste of time compared to the ease and control of a saute pan."
2,Didn't Last!!!,"I only used this machine about 10 times, now the grill plates won't open!! I am very disappointed, Sunbeam says to throw the unit away! I am so mad, not only does the unit not work anymore, I am stuck with all these parchment bags that were SO expensive!!"
4,Try parchment paper!,"I love my Rocket Grill. One thing that many of the reviewers complained about is the cost of the bags. Well, try parchment paper for non-juicy items. You buy it where you buy waxed paper and aluminum foil. If you are making grilled cheese sandwiches or other non-juicy items it works wonderfully! Fold it in half over the sandwich and then fold in the sides about one inch. You need to be sure you make it long enough to stick out on top of the grill because it doesn't have handles like the bags do. But, it works great! I've used parchment paper with grilled cheese sandwiches, heating my tuna sandwiches, cooking salmon, reheating chicken, and I even cooked catfish although it was a little crushed, LOL!The one reason I gave it four stars instead of five is that, like a few others, my dial broke and I have to use pliers to turn the dial."
2,"Fast heater, bad smell","This is a slick water heater. It is 1500 watts so it heats the water quickly. It doesn't have any insulation so the water doesn't stay hot, but it doesn't take long to reheat. The electrical connection is through the base, so if you take the kettle off the base the connections shuts off, and that's slick. The kettle does make the water hot!What's not to like? Well, the inside of the kettle is stainless steel with a stainless steel tube running from the bottom to above the water level. On top of the tube they put on a plastic cover! The plastic cover plus the plastic nut holding the handle on the lid imparts a smell and a bit of a taste to the water. We used it for about 2 weeks then decided to order a replacement kettle (different brand). We don't usually send things back so this kettle may end up in my shop for when I need hot water.I'd like to recommend this product, but the plastic parts pretty much ruin it, in my opinion."
1,waste of money,"I bought this item 2 months ago when I moved to the USA, I was surprised to see that most people here use a hob top kettle which doesnt switch off automatically. I wanted what I was used to & because this would be 'on show' in my open plan home it had to look stylish. So I thought the price might reflect that & discounted the cheaper versions. What a fool!DAY 1, the second time I used it the outside part of the handle came off. I had thrown the box out already so decided to persever without the outer casing. Within a month the automatic switch off is cutting in well before the water is boiled. It makes big cracking sounds when boiling & is really loud throughout the long boiling time. I need to stand over it just as I would with a hob top. Useless. Waste of money."
2,Not worth the price,"This kettle is rather small. Great for one or two cups for the office perhaps. Don't get this if you want to avoid plastic. There is a plastic topper on the heat element that is sure to come into contact with the boiling water because of the small capacity. Also, the handle on the lid is incredibly flimsy! Will undoubtedly break soon. Generally this item is not worth the price I paid and I returned it."
2,expected more quality for the money,"Although beautiful to look at, this product seems light and flimsily made for the price. The top piece is made of hard plastic, and I wonder how long it will last after pulling it to get the top off every day.Although lovely among my other stainless kitchen utensils, and working well the first few weeks, I wonder how long it will last - kind of like the economy."
5,great product,"I've had one for 18 years. It burned a wire out twice in that time, but was easily repairable by taking off the bottom and replacing the wire. I bought a different kettle each time that burned out in months, so I resuscitated my Chefs Choice. The thermostat has finally gone and I'm buying a new one. Hope it's made as well as this one was. I never write reviews, but this kettle deserved one."
5,really just perfect,"coming up on 10 yrs of ownership. That's saying a lot already. But what makes this a stand out is that somewhere around year 1 or 2, the base blew a fuse or capacitor . I think this is a safety feature as it happend after we somehow forced the pot to stay on after the water had evaporated.I contacted the manufacturer, and they replaced the base with a new one, no question asked. Has been running flawlessly ever since. We use this pot several times a day, and time after time it rapidly brings water to a boil. Nice looking kettle, too.If this kettle ever wears out ( which it seems will never happen) I will surely buy another Chef's Choice!"
4,Whoops.....not repairable!,"We have enjoyed our 685 teakettle for a few years. A couple of days ago I opened the teakettle to add water and found that the plastic internals that shut off the kettle had disintegrated. I called Chef's Choice to obtain replacement parts and was informed that replacement parts are not available and that I would have to purchase a complete new teakettle. What a waste! All the rest of the teakettle is in great condition but it has to be thrown away because of the flimsey internals. Chef's Choice should take another look at this problem and make replacement parts available, our Green World demands that we not discard items that can continue to be useful."
4,best electric teakettle,Tried this after buying the similar cuisinart which seemed a little heavier metal but created a plastic taste to the water. This did not seem to add any taste.
2,A much better product when it was made in Germany.,"The Chinese version of this kettle is lighter and more flimsy - true, it is cheaper, but sometimes you just don't want cheap. We had a German one that lasted 10 years - and is still being used by by wife in her office. The one we recently got just is not the same item. Bo! on Chef's Choice."
5,Best tea kettle ever,Have used one daily for 9 years and after thousands of cups of tea it still works as well as the day I bought it. I'd buy another one in a heartbeat and will never not own one. Probably my best purchase ever all things considered.
3,flaw in manufacture,"had same item before and its a great design that works well. this one does not sit firmly on its base; it wobbles slightly. still works, but less pleasing to use"
2,Looks pretty but doesn't turn off quickly,"This kettle looks pretty but doesn't turn off once it boils. This means it dumps steam into the room for at least two minutes, fogging windows and generally dampening things up quite a bit. Also, the round grip on the top is made out of plastic and feels shoddy, as does the turn on switch. I wish I had returned it but I am slow getting things into the mail and the 30 days passed before I knew it. Oh well, it does boil water!"
4,Electric Kettle,"This was a gift for a senior citizen- and he loves it. It is very fast, much quicker than stove top kettles."
1,There's a better choice,"Take a look at the Melitta Express Kettle. It shuts off soon after it reaches the boiling point. Has a tip type of lid which latches to prevent burns but is easily opened. Costs $30 less than the Chef's Choice and is very attractive. I have had mine for about 6 months and it still looks perfect and operates wonderfully. Heats water very fast. Has a interior water level guide. Unfortunately, it doesn't show up near the top in most searches on Amazon or I am sure it would become a big seller. You can get it at Target, so you have instant gratification."
1,This kettle stopped working on the second day.,"The day after I received it this kettle it would not stay on so that it would not boil water. If I balance a wooden spoon in between the on/off switch I can boil water but I have to physically take the spoon out to turn of the kettle off. Unfortunately I threw away the packaging, but I think I will send it back anyway."
3,Flimsy,"I haven't yet had this hot water kettle for a week and already the handle has broken off the lid. It is really flimsy and the lid fits very tightly so you have to use some force to get it off and on. They should have a lid like many of the other brands that is on a hinge and opens easier. Kettle works fine other than the lid, but for the price ($80.00) it should be better built!Chef's Choice 685 International Deluxe Cordless Electric Teakettle"
2,Bad fit,Not like the kettle I had before (same make and model). The kettle does not sit right on the base. It's like wearing shoes a size too big.
2,Loud and a bit dodgy,"We've had this kettle for a few years now and we are ready for a divorce. The kettle has always been very loud when operating. As it aged the lever under the handle which turns on the kettle switches itself off during operation. I suppose this is due to the vibrations caused by the water moving around in the kettle. When it does manage to stay on for the whole boil it is also slow to turn off. Sometimes it is more than a minute after it boils that it decides to turn off. It is a beautiful kettle and well made but, its function is less than desirable."
2,Great design but slow to heat water,"This is a beautiful kettle. I thought it was awfully pricey but I really needed a replacement after my old one burned out. This one seems a bit slow to heat water, but at least it looks great on the counter."
1,Persistent Taste of Plastic,"This is the first time we have ever returned a purchase to Amazon. Several previous reviews have described water boiled in this kettle having a chemical taste of plastic. Although these raised my concern, I ignored it thinking that these reviews came from overly fussy individuals, and that we would not encounter the same problem. Wrong!! My husband, who did not even know about these negative comments, was the one who stated that his tea had a chemical taste when he first used the kettle to boil water. Approximately ten batches of water later when the problem persisted, we finally concluded we don't want to continue using this kettle and are returning it. Thank goodness that Amazon has a reasonable return policy."
2,Great Design; zero quality,"First, I agree with the virtures of this product noted by other reviewers - it's a great design. Second, it has serious quality issues. We purchased in 2004, and sent it back for repair that year. Seems that the automatic shutoff feature stopped working (even when it worked, it allowed the water to boil about 1 minute or more before shutting off). It was repaired under warranty, then failed again. Well, the ""Chef"" no longer heats at all. (ice tea, anyone?) We NEVER ran it with low water, and it NEVER overheated. OK, this product is made in China, which can be good...or bad. A similar kettle at Wal-Mart is about $15.00 If the company attended to quality as much as appearance and features, it would be a great kettle. So...about $100 to heat water less than two years.Good luck, all."
2,Will not last long,"I have had this kettle for 18 months. First year it worked great. The switch turned off somwhat late, but actually it takes a while until the whole volume of boiling water reaches ""boiling temperature"", so the switch is set theoretically just right.The weak point of the design are all the plastic parts. After a year of exposure to heat, exposed plastc parts become brittle and brake.First was a lid handle, than the water level - vapor conduit assembly. All that I could fix myself. However after 18 months electric switch stopped working, and it was beyond repair. All the switch assembly is made out of plastic, riveted to the bottom of the kettle and it is impossible to disasemble it without destroying the whole thing. In summary - not worth the price."
3,A Few Areas of Concern,"My just turned 4yr old loves fairies and received this book as a gift. I'm admittedly picky about what we read her, but I thought I'd share my areas of concern for other picky readers.Others have mentioned the page about poisoned broccoli and that one got to me, too. My child loves veggies and luckily understood that was just Alice's imagination, but I can see how it could cause a problem in other households.The ending leaves much to ask for. On our first read I was sure I must have missed a page at the end, b/c the story just abruptly ends with ""I'll probably be a temporary fairy forever"" after having such fun with her thoughts up to that point. Why not a ""maybe tomorrow I'll..."", or a ""once I'm a permanent fairy I'll..."" It just didn't fit for such an imaginative little character to become complacent at the turn of a page.Out of the dozen books she received last week this one just isn't one of our favorites."
5,I loved this book!,This is one of those rare books that you don't mind reading to your child every single night for six months.
2,I'm not a fan,"I gave this two stars instead of one only because my daughter does like this book. I don't. In addition to the author writing ""alot"" as one word, he manages to demonize broccoli and mothers while glorifying sugar and dads. There are so many more entertaining books in the world. Skip this one."
3,"My nieces liked it, I kinda didn't.","They kept asking me to read it before we brought it back to the library (we didn't renew it), but something about it rubbed me the wrong way. Maybe it was Alice stealing her dad's cookies, maybe it was the implication that broccoli and oatmeal are yucky (well, my nieces love both, that's not likely to change because of a book, but personally, I'm getting tired of seeing those ideas in print for every kid's book EVER), maybe it was the refusal to clean her room... I don't know.For whatever reason, things that don't bug me *that* much in other books really bothered me in this one.Read before buying, definitely."
2,"NOTE: ""WORD CONTENT""","Please note - if you are trying to keep the word ""hate"" out of your childs vocabulary - this books has the word ""hate"" in it. It also says - I don't like broccoli. You should take a look at this book at your local bookstore/library before you buy it - to see if it fits your idea of what is or isn't acceptable."
1,"If your child likes broccoli, don't buy this book","because he/she probably won't eat broccoli after reading it. It might be a silly reason to give a bad rating to a book, but when your child loves broccoli, reads a book that says broccoli is poisoned and should be avoided, and from that point on refuses to eat it, you don't like the book.I wish authors would think about this kind of thing."
4,Bailey,"I bought this book because my grandson wanted ""Duck on a bike"" by the same author and I didn't want his sister feeling left out. Well! Good choice. She loves it. She's five and its just right for her visually and in terms of text. There are not too many words for her to get tired when she's attempting to read it and a big plus is that the story makes her laugh. I would certainly recommend this book."
5,AN INSTANT CLASSIC!!!,"From the author of the fabulous ""No, David!"" series of books, here's one for the little girls. Alice is the most adorable, precocious girl, who dresses up as a fairy (and is therefore a ""temporary fairy."" One has to go to a special school to become a permanent fairy.) I was always amazed by the David books because the author perfectly captures what an active little boy is like (exactly like my little brother, also named David). He did it again this time by perfectly capturing a little girl (like many 2-5 year olds) who hates to eat broccoli and take baths (so she hopes to use her magic wand to turn her bath into strawberry jello.) My 4 year old daughter was in stitches over the content and the amazing illustrations. This book will definitely be high on my Christmas list to give to all of my daughter's friends this year."
5,Alice is Adorable!,"My 6 yr old loves all the ""David"" books. So when I saw that Shannon wrote one with a girl as the main character( for a 1st grader to read), I had to get it. The story is funny, the pictures are great.Very imaginative."
5,MUST READ for young girls!!!,"I enjoy Alice the Fairy everytime we read it. My daughter enjoyed it early on but REALLY appreciates the humor now that she is 6. She loves to read it herself, now, and we laugh out loud at Alice's creativity and wit. I buy this book for my friend's daughter's and give it for birthday gifts. You will not be disappointed!!!!"
1,Misspelled word right on page one. Ugh!,"This book would have been so perfect for my daughter. Unfortunately, there is a misspelled word right on page one.Note to the editor, publisher, and author: ""alot"" is not a word. It is spelled, ""a lot""."
1,Not A Good Book,I tried reading this book but both the content and the style wereterrible. I learned nothing from it and I am highly disappointedwith the reviews I read because it was those positive reviews that convinced me to read the book. My intention is not to be critical but I can't help believe that the people who wrote these reviews were friends of the author. There are many other books that I can recommend that are a more informative read than this book.
5,Is your house a reflection of what you believe?,"Our homes should be reflections of our beliefs and who we really are rather than collections of mass-marketed, trendy items. Having our beliefs around us incorporated in to our interiors: personal mottoes on walls, embroidered into pillows, or painted onto chairs; portraits of those who inspire us; handmade quilts, pottery, or oil paintings--these are all the things that affirm who we are and who we want to be. If we see our beliefs and dreams in front of us on a daily basis, it is easier to manifest them.This book demonstrates how we all have the tools to build our own houses of belief. It does not require special talent for interior design, just a strong desire to express our individuality and to make our homes havens that uplift our hearts and minds."
5,A revolutionary book by an author with heart,"I saw Kelee Katillac on the Carolyn Myss Show on Oprah's Oxygen Network. I was blown away by her personal story of healing while living in a trailer house--through creativity, .... I couldn't wait to get it so went out and bought it that day. I read it in two days and it has changed my life. Finally I feel good about the creative ideas I had for my home. I always thoughtthat because I wasn't a designer or artist that they must be wrong. Her life and work-with all income levels and types of people shows that we are all creative and our positive ideas are messages from the Creator.I am now a follower of this idea and am convinced of her message's power;through her newsgroup I have found many others who feel the same and I feel I speak for them too--a person who has given her whole life to help others engenders a lot of loyalty--Katillac even sold her own home's contents to fund a Habitat for Humanity program...."
5,Singer Zipper Foot,Could not find item locally so was very glad to be able to buy through Amazon. Item is as expected. Satisified customer.
5,A Definitive Music History,"I recently bought this book and found it to be outstanding. Ihave read quite a few music books including library references(although not text books - which this is) and found this book to be quite readable yet scholarly and comprehensive. There are many insets devoted to major composers, virtually no significant composer is omitted and there are many maps showing the cultural settings of the varius music periods. There are couple page summaries at the end of chapters. Unlike some books you're half way through by the time you get to Beethoven. I was glad that there is extensive coverage to medieval and renaissance music. The latin liturgy is well explained. The book shows well the place of music history in the general history of the west - in fact I got some new insights about western history. Lastly it is reasonably price for a college text. END"

4,Excellent short adventure set in the World of Greyhawk,"Here's a grim little tale set in the World of Greyhawk - you may have always thought of gargoyles as sinister, deadly adversaries, but what do you do when one stalks you, wakes you, and begs you help him recover his stolen wings? This is one of my all-time favorite adventures to entice novices into the game - a wonderful story for levels 1-4."
2,Holster Auto Dials Numbers,"I am on my third holster like this now. The first just became really worn (after about a year) and didn't look professional. The second got caught on the seatbelt or something when I was getting out of the car. The third, I just got.On all three, they seemed to need a breaking in period. They would all automatically dial someone on my address list when I would pull the Blackberry out of the holster. Usually, I wouldn't notice and the person would be at the other end saying ""Hello? Hello?"" This last one is especially bad for that and I have to remember to turn the key lock on each time I put it in the holster - quite a pain.I think that the root problem is that it is too tight and results in buttons being pushed when the holster is squeezed and when removing it from the holster. The other two seemed to get better over time. Hopefully this third one will too."
4,"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THIS ITEM","I purchased this case for my blackberry. I have dropped my phone and no damage...lots of protection. Also, I like how the screen shuts down upon putting it in the case. You can adjust your phones setting to work with this case to turn on at a certain time, ring differently, etc. I highly recommend it...not too bulky either..."
3,OK for the price,"The case itself is well constructed and holds up well. However, the phone does not always go into sleep mode when placed in the holster, and thus I have had to reprogram some keys a couple times after having the Blackberry in the case."
1,Does not Work,I have bought two of these. Each time they have not fit my blackberry. Also the magnet does not work so my blackberry does not go off. I don't get in the holster rings.
2,"Attractive, but kills batteries","I like the way this case looks and feels, and the belt-clip is very good. But it may not be an ""official"" Blackberry product, becasue it doesn't seem to put the 8700 into sleep mode properly. The screen goes off when you put it in, but my batteries were dying after 10-20 hours under regular use, whereas with my old belt clip (the hard plastic one which comes with the 8700), my batteries would last for 3 or 4 days. That was really inconvenient, so I had to go get another ""official"" Blackberry hard-plastic case, which I don't like the look of as much."
2,Blackberry Case - Still not sure about this one,I'm giving 2 stars to this case for doing simply what I needed it to do - carry my blackberry and limit scratches to the unit. The seams on my case have already begun to come undone and I'm not quite sure if this case functions like a a 'true' blackberry case - placing the unit into standby (in holster) and waking it up when I pull it out. It doesnt happen that way the majority of the time. This is a great value for those that are just looking for a carrying case - but not so much that want it all.
3,Surprisingly average...,"Normally I am a fan of RIM products, but this case was average and the clip on the back broke in less than a year of use."
1,Very cheaply made,The bead styrofoam float assembly which is needed to close the switch is designed to last maybe 3 days or so.
3,Probably wouldn't buy again.,"Living in Fla., none of the local stores carry humidifiers, (plenty of de-humidifiers), and one was needed for medical reasons, to be used only at night.We researched on-line and we thought this one was the closest to what we were looking for.Suppose to be adequate water storage and ""quiet"" night time setting. We have to refill every 3rd night and the night setting is far from quiet. But, like a noisy ceiling fan, one can get use to it.Pros: Easier to fillCons: Noisy"
1,"don't buy, it won't last","Was good for a couple of Winters. Now, the motor makes a horrible rattling noise at both speeds. The motor rotor itself is the source of the noise, I have tried adding weights to keep it from rattling, but have not been able to come up with a decent solution. These type of motors are basically throw aways. Could be the bearings....... I also was not happy with how awkward it was to re-assemble the unit when you opened it completely. Such as when you would check, change the filter etc. The water level sensor is very tricky to get back in. Overall, it did what it was supposed to at first (despite it's cheap construction!)but was not made to last. I would not recommend it!"
1,what a waste,"We used the humidifier for approx three months. It only has two settings. The lower setting is useless; the higher setting is incredibly noisy, yet we had it run all night and it was not humidifying at all. We used it upstairs for an area of approx 500/600 sqft. We used the recommended anti-mold product but the smell was very strong. The filter was getting dirty so fast we had to change it very often, which makes maintenance expensive. It's bulky and heavy to move, yet made out of flimsy plastic."
3,Not That Impressed So Far...,"Granted it is Alaska and it is a high of 4 today, but I was expecting more from this unit. It can't get over 41% and it's set on 50%. I've had it on high for hours. I've also tried low for hours. It makes no difference. For what it's worth my house is about 1800sq. feet. In all fairness, this is unseasonably cold for November. If I can at least hold 40% the entire winter I'll be O.K. with the purchase."
5,Amazing,This humidifier is the best I have found in my long quest for humidity! No need for the hi power fan. Low is great! It auto shuts off when humidity rises to the corrected level!
