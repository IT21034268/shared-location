5,It's More Fun To Kraftwerk!,"Kraftwerk talk of ""Home Computer"",""Computer Love"",""PocketCalculator"" and that ""It's more Fun To Compute""-so musically thisalbum is a tounge-and-cheek look at the mechanized nature ofearly 1980's pop culture-all done in a musically minimal andsynthetic fasion.But the backbeats are funky to the hilt and arethe clear beginnings of electro-funk,notably on ""Numbers"".Thisis the album Afrika Bambaata and other sunk their teeth into.Beyond essencial!"
5,EXPERTLY KRAFTED,"A true work of genius by the boyz of Dusseldorff, COMPUTER WORLD is the band's most consistent piece of work (werk?). Eerily prophetic in its themes, KRAFTWERK not only predicts the total computerization of the world (welt?), but actually also forsees the advent of cybersex by almost twenty years!!"
4,Strange But Great,"Every time I hear Computer World I can't decide whether to laugh or to bow down in reverence at it's electronic genius. Maybe a little of both. What makes this album so amusing, especially to British and American audiences is that it's so stereotypically GERMAN! Precise, simple, arrogant, and technical. The lyrics are little more than numerals or strange declarations: ""I'm the operator of my pocket calculator."" However, to dismiss Kraftwerk as kitsch is to miss a lot of the innovations that they pioneered. The percolating arpeggios on Computer World and the tight, crisp drums on Pocket Calculator are virtual building blocks for the dance and electronic music to come. For anyone intersted in the history of electronic music, or who wants to just have a good time in a weird kind of way, Computer World is where to start."
5,An essential album,"This is a great album that every electronics fan needs to have (along with every other Kraftwerk CD). What amazes me most is that they use such simple lyrics yet totally convey their message. Considering the year this album was released it is also amazing that they could see so well into the future of how computers will be so important to us. Musically, the theme is totally obvious. Computer sounds turned into awesome electronic music as only Kraftwerk could do. Its fun and quirky and one of the best albums in this genre."
4,I have bigger ears now than I did in 1981!,"This is my only Kraftwerk CD. I bought it only recently; I had NO interest in ""Krautrock"" when they were active. My motivation to buy this CD in particular was that I read where Neil Young was listening to it around the time of recording ""Trans"". Well, I can guarantee that's not a lie because he has rewritten 'Computer World..2' as 'Computer Age'! I can see a thread from 'Numbers' through Afrika Bambaata to Arthur Baker's work with New Order on 'Confusion' and beyond into rap, hip hop and other variants so it has convinced me that Kraftwerk have been VERY influential. The copy I have is a recent UK EMI reissue and the sound is great. There are no bonus tracks so it's quite short - but it's very, very good!"
3,Improved,It is true: the remastering has done miracles espec ially for this one which sounded really thin on CD. However it is in my opinion not the work that has g ained the most from the new batch of remasterings since it does not have the same amplitude in sounds as the others. However it is a splendid piece as vinyl.
5,"So simple and yet challenging, educational and FUN!","I am a first grade teacher, and I am crazy about this game. I have to admit that when I first saw the commercial for these, I was perplexed. Cups? It's just stacking cups? But then my own kids started raving about how they had used them in PE and how much fun they were. So, I used some of my supply money to purchase two sets for my first grade class and WOW! What a hit! I bought a set for each of my own kids (9 & 12) and we've all had a blast with them! I would so much rather see them playing with these than with the video games and they like these as well or better! BTW, The Sport Stacking web site has a number of studies on the benefits of this activity."
5,Great Game,This is a great game that will improve hand/eye co-ordination and motor skills. Much better than staring at a video game on the tv or computer.
5,Perfect as a gift!,I gave this book to a lovely young lady (8 years old) who is going to London with her family in August. She loves it. She had already read another Madeline book but had not seen this one. The CD is a nice addition for this book. I am glad I chose this book for her before she actually goes to London (and Paris!).
4,A good read but too short.,"I could hardly wait to read Patriots and Tyrants. As a continuation of the main BattleTech storyline, I was curious to see if Loren Coleman would prove to be a worthy successor to Michael Stackpole. While a good read, the book suffers from its shortness. Stackpole was able to write at length about not only the mech battles but the personal side of the BattleTech universe. Now the two are squeezed into less than 300 pages.Still the book is very good. I especially enjoyed the conflicting scenes played out by Victor and Omi against Katherine at Christmas. Coleman did a fantastic job in portraying the siblings as polar opposites.Although too short for my taste, Patriots and Tyrants is a very enjoyable read. I only hope the word limit placed on authors is seen for the folly it is and is removed soon."
1,stackpole was better,"It mad me cry! Coleman tries but he pretty much killed all stackpole's characters- they all [stink] now. Katherine and Victor both turned shallow, Tancred wasn't himself anymore, and they just had to try and kill one of my favorite characters- Arthur"
4,Unlike Grisham --- Realistic.,"How many Grisham novels can we take, with the same formula, the preposterous unrealistic plots and Tom Cruise characters? The Deal is convincingly plausible. It could really happen. The story is suspenseful and interesting. Unlike Grisham, the author has really practiced law and knows what really goes on [ OK, so maybe Grisham practiced in some backwater in Mississippi ]. Highly recommended --- but skip the overly long chapter where they are skiing --- adds little but about 30 pages."
4,A Great Deal,"Willett's debut work is as fast a page-turner as any Grisham book. I found myself not only entrenched within the story but the Bostonian environs as well. Lively characters and descriptive settings, The Deal is well worth a read. I look forward to Willett's sophmore corpus"
2,Idea better than plot,The plot is weak especially when it gets to the ending. The story simply falls apart and the piece about in-out records of visitors is particularly embarrasing and unconvincing. I suggest you read Compelling Evidence of Steve Martini and you can see the difference between outstanding and so-so writings.
4,Different in a good way!,"Being from a small city with no green what so ever, except the softball park, i loved the descriptive parts of the farm, milking process, how things that we eat everyday is made and the grueling hours of labor and heartbreak these farmers go through this author portrayed in to a funny and entertaining mystery book.Stella is my kind of character! Strong, beautiful and a bit of vurnurablity that makes her seem human! She could take care of everything on her farm and in her life but when these mysterious sickness get to her famly, her world comes crashing down like her burned barn. Add the dashing Nick and hot Abe and you have a book everyone wants to read!I would recommend this book through and through so get a copy today!"
3,"""creditable""","I own and was raised on a farm and we milked cows. I would give the story 5 stars,except for the cuss words which I felt lowered the ""bar"" for a higher rating."
5,Mystery fans will find plenty to thrill them,"A sexy, tough dairy farmer with an eye for investigation attacks clues left behind to a farming community struck by plague in Judy Clemens' unusual Till The Cows Come Home. Mystery fans will find plenty to thrill them in this hard-hitting first novel which comes to life with powerful characterization and unusual plots and sub-plots."
3,okay,never finished the book because it just got bogged down. Glad it was free. Maybe I will try it another time
5,Love this series,"I love this series....why did she only write 5 books in this series, I would have kept reading them until the cows came home. Although I also love her Grim Reaper series. I like strong female characters, no cozies, no romantic mysteries, or predictable suspense.If you like Marcia Muller, Sue Grafton, Linda Barnes, Judith van Giesen, etc., you'll like this."
4,This is a realistic story of dairy farm life and the sensible feelings of a woman raised in the real world.,I thoroughly enjoyed the realistic descriptions in this story of life on a dairy farm. It was a good mystery. Stella is a person with realistic reactions to life and to romance.
3,Weaker Waits,"Although this album can portray the moody grumbler's early-career, jazz-club-cat almost comically in retrospect, it is only because of what an expansive and respected artist Waits fully became, as even his lesser inspired works highlight a haggardly engaging lyricist."
2,Eight Days of Dripping,"While these candles are pretty, they have little else to be said about them. They burn fast and drip consistently. It was a hard Hanukkah with them! I definetly won't be purchasing these again."
3,In The Woods,"I think this started out as a well thought out plan on paper. Nothing happens for the first 45 minutes. When the ""action"" starts it just went to a jumbled, anything goes film. This is the first movie that made me talk to my computer. ""No!:"" ""Idiots."" ""Your looking to be killed."" The ending left me unsatisfied, and only made me ask more unanswered questions. I was left wondering if a ""In The Woods 2"". was the directors idea. This would have been a better book. But, 3 stars since the characters were just so many dumb decisions, I couldn't turn away."
2,falls flat,"""A couple having a camping vacation"" and that's about it, except for stiff dialog, morphing accents, unexplained edits, some really uncreative filming, and lack of empathy for any character in this film. Two scenes illustrate the failures: first they finally get to the woods and we see the first great vista beyond them, only it's cloudy and foggy and there's dead trees everywhere and boulders and dead grass... second, he blindfolds her (is that before of after the bear trap discovery?) and takes her to ""the most beautiful place"" only,it's just the side of a miserable hill that's been cleared years ago. It's ugly!I guess these two women did the entire picture, produced, directed, wrote, starred in, and forgot to hire anyone to say, ""Wait a minute, that doesn't make any sense.""You can skip this one with confidence."
5,An entertaining thriller!!,"I just finished watching this epic thriller and am compelled to get more people to view this masterpiece that Rodger Ebirt gave three thumbs up. For myself, the subtle yet lingering imagery the protagonist relies upon will hit you from a place you have never felt before. The raw and twisted evil that lives in all of us comes forward and deals a hard blow to the already vulnerable insurance corporations. If you love your husband, wife, parents, significant other, your simply must, must watch this movie and them make them cancel all life insurance policies in your name! Epic, apocalyptic, inspiring, jaw dropping...watch it and be warned!"
1,Not really a game.,"This software is so memory-intensive, and so filled with fancy cartoon graphics, that it can hardly be called game software at all. When you get to what is supposed to be the actual games, there are no instructions. There used to be fairly simple programs in which you could just open it up and play blackjack or craps and maybe learn something. It seems that software has gotten so fancy that that really doesn't exist any more, or if it does, there's no information in Amazon about how to find it. A dissapointment. I'll return it if I can find the mailing material it came with. EA"
2,this is completely not like the show,"smallville is the best show ever. but when i read this book, i found it very disappointing. it is nothing like the show. first off, clark is not that infatuated with lana! he's not constantly thinking of lana like he does in this book! secondly, this book is extremely sexist! it's always a guy who's saving the day! clark, jonathan or pete! When the creature attacks nell potter, lana just screams while clark and pete attempt to save nell. in the show, lana would at least try to do something, not just scream like a little sissy girl! and, lastly, what kind of girl do you think lana is anyways? no one spends one hour combing their hair! puh-leeze! Well, anyhow, I do not recommend this book to anyone who has ever watched Smallville for it will truly offend them."
2,Not a Good Tie In,"Smallville fans will buy this book because there isn't enough books on Smallville. However, you will be disappointed because there are tons of errors, misspellings, flawed characterizations. Lana screaming pathetically? For example, Lana's no superhero like Clark, but she has never been a wimp. The scenes of the freak Dragon killing off his victims are beyond family fare unlike the television series. Who is this author writing for? Not anyone who watches Smallville."
3,I expected more,"Going into this book I expected more from it. I was somewhat disappointed.I did like the action present throughout the book.I also found myself really enjoying the Clark/Lana aspect of the story when I usually find it sickening. I can't really pinpoint any specific problems with it, I just expected something with more substance.Again I must say that folks reading these books probably are already aware of how Clark came to be in Smallville and it does not need to be explained in every book. It really slows the story down."
3,Fair Music!,I like this music.. its a good set of music.. but it does get boring after playing it too long.. It also makes the room feel eary sometimes.. which is not that great compared to Christian music..but.. I would like to say it is a very good adbventerous music.. I would like to see more pleasent themes for the songs.. like the new cd the composer has coming out involves gargoyles.. I don't really think that is totally a Christian theme. But than I know a few people will disagree.Other than that.. fair music!
2,Somewhat helpful but SLOPPY!,"I am generally a fan of the ""for Dummies"" books..so this one is a real disappointment. Disorganized, scattered...any of the above. The information is there, but you have to dig it out. One of the biggest disappointments lies in the fact that the company has bundled the book with Code Warrior Lite....while the authors, in many of their comments about using Code Warrior refer to the full edition. Therefore, they wax poetic about launching Palm Emulators, etc, from the Palm OS Menu in Code Warrior...a feature not supported by Lite. Now, this doesn't make the book useless, but it does make it FRUSTRATING! Is the book worth having? Well, bang-for-the-buck -wise I would say yes, but don't expect too much from it."
3,Ok. but there has got to be better Palm Programming books,"Overall, I was a bit disappointed in this book. The major problem I hit was I had to download POSE from the Palm website in order to run the examples. I think this should have been on the CD.The next problem was there was some inconsistancies between the text and the actual Codewarrior tool. I think that careful editing would have caught these inconsistancies.Don't get me wrong, there is some good material in this book; But, you have to read carefully to find it. The examples are OK but the material is not orgranized well to get started quickly (i.e. I had to read much of the book before I could start trying to write my own programs)."
2,The worst yet,"I have been searching for the ""holy grail"" Palm prgramming book, and let me tell you, this one isn't it! I have 3 titles besides this one with one more on the way and I have yet been able to do want I want to do. This particular item falls short in several areas. 1. The code snippets in the book are worthless out of context of the whole application that they come from. 2. The applications contain above and beyind the basics in some cases, certainly not for dummies. 3. I've programmed in C for 12 years and found the examples cryptic at best. 4. Heavy reliance and Code Warrior (which could be good or bad), at least a copy of Code Warrior Lite was included.I could go on but enough said. When I find that grail I'm going to send the author something because whomever he/she is will deserve it."
1,Absolutely useless.,"The CD does not match the examples and the code does not perform as indicated. Obviously the editors never actually tried to use this book for it's intended purpose or it would have never gotten to press.The quality of the Dummies series has always been uneven, but this is inexcusable."
3,A decent beginner's book,"This book is fine if you are relatively new to the PalmOS programming world. Albiet, the author's examples are not put together very well. His coding examples are somewhat hard to follow and I was constantly having to look at his source code on CD to determine the mysterious functions he developed and not written in his book. I would much prefer he stayed to the style of the Palm Developement Standards. A bit more should have been written in the Database and Conduit areas.Issues notwithstanding, it is a good book to get started."
5,It cant happen here???,"Apparently, it can. The Zappas are listening and giving us fans what we have asked for eons. This package includes the ORIGINAL stereo version of Freak Out! instead of the current remixed Ryko CD that Zappa prepared in the late 80's. The original is still best and here it is on CD for the first. The Zappas apparently have also understood that the Zappa catalogue is in bad shape sonically and have been using the best of the best mastering engineers in their latest projects. This one has been remastered by Doug Sax, who remastered among other things, the Pink Floyd catalogue. Very well done indeed.Disc 2 includes mono mixes, outtakes, instrumental only tracks and brief snippets. Similar to the Pet Sounds box, these tracks help tell the story of one of the greatest albums of all time. A 4CD box can also be acquired at Zappa website, which hopefully will be available at amazon soon too.Higly recommended to all Zappa heads out there!"
5,The saddest thing is that I don't own it,"I have bought this album twice and given it away twice. It is a beautiful piece of music from start to finish. This album plays to his absolute strength which is his earnest songwriting. Later in his career he would put on several different masks and assume the role of many different characters, but this album is probably my favorite . If you are not a Tom Waits fan this is a wonderful place to start. If you are then I don't need to tell you to buy this album."
4,I am the guy from Delaware/Lancaster/Athens,"I wanted to add that 'Closing Time' is essential for any modest Tom Waits collection. Watch out for 'Martha', though. It WILL depress you."
3,it only gets better from here,"the reason i rated this album so harshley is because this is in my opinion toms weakest effort. Though the album is nice and consistent with beautiful songwriting, really the only time i put it on is to go to sleep. this is a good intro but i recommend if you buys this and you like it to go out and immediatly by his next album heart of saturday night and continue chronilogically"
3,Like it but....,"I just have a question....Will they ever make ""Anthology"" into a CD? Its a great collection of Tom Wait songs. What Gives? sherry"
3,"A Good Start, But a Career Low","Have to say this is the album of Tom's I play least. Wasn't realized well enough - - - sure, there's the classic ""Ol' 55"", ""Old Shoes"", ""Midnight Lullabye"", ""Rosie"" and ""Martha"", but the style is cramped by a too omnipresent orchestra, and the album seems too forced to make Waits ""radio-friendly"". It's a good thing Waits lost Yester as a producer and moved on to the much more compatible Howe for his second (and much more recommended album) ""Heart of Saturday Night"". ""Closing Time"" is his first album, true, and does feature some great songs, but I would have to recommed it for completists only. Waits is like good liquor or wine, I think . . ."
5,All Time Favorite,"This is my all time favorite Tom Waits CD. So much of Tom's stuff is just too harsh, lacking melody. I welcome recommendations of other ofTom's work that is similiar to Closing Time."
5,truly outstanding,"What stands out most about this album is its timelessness. It sounds as good today as when it was first released. Simultaneously evokes memories of sitting on porches during warm summer nights and getting sloshed in smokey taverns. Love, regret, sorrow and joy. Perfect!"
4,"So young, yet so old.","Tom Waits' sounds quite a bit different on this early (First?) CD. The voice is not as rough, it is a more tuneful instrument. The music is a bit brighter than in his later work. You hear the beginning of the bittersweet narrator of so many wonderful songs. ""Martha"" and ""I Hope That I Don't Fall In Love With You"" stand with any ballads that Waits' has written and ""Lonely"" is haunting in its simplicity. Although Waits' later work is more to my liking, Closing Time stands up well against any of Waits' material."
4,"3 BIG Battles, one low price","These are three different 48-minute videos. Each one has a little different style.The one about the Gulf War was generally good. One thing all of them have in common is that the troops are shown on a map as a little colored box, and then animated arrows show where they are going, a nice touch. So, when Saddam sent troops into Saudi Arabia, I got to see the action re-created in little blocks moving around (interspersed with actual footage).The Six Day War was perhaps the best produced one. There was a lot of different things happening, and they explained it pretty clearly. This video was trying to pack a lot into those precious 48 minutes. The other 2 had time to spare, and so could have a pregnant pause now and again.The WWII one was quite interesting. An otherwise un-heard-of battle which marked the first big battle to win the war. It was quite exciting to watch."
5,In-depth and captivating.,"This is a wonderful documentary. It allows us to get to know Robert Kennedy, the man. He wasn't perfect, nor should he be thought of in that light. However, he was a good man. He contained the capacity to grow, to change his thoughts and perceptions. It wasn't calculated or expedient, but true inner change. The man he became after his brother was killed stands out as the man we should remember. He was still a good man before JFK's assassination, but he became more thoughtful, caring and empathetic afterwards. I just hated the fact that this documentary had to come to its inevitable conclusion."
5,Best movie about RFK!!!!!!,"This is a fantastic movie about RFK!!! BUY THIS MOVIE ABSOLUTELY!! After watching this, you will really understand Rfk. It's extremely complete and you can see him at all ages. There is a very rare part when he's young, but you see him during his hole life. They speak a little too much about civil rights or the cuban missiles crisis, but it's normal."
1,Unhappy,"I was NOT happy with this item as I thought it was a childs coat rack...instead it was the pattern. I paid OVER 7.00 S&H for a huge and heavy catalogue that I will never use, along with other junk mail included.The pattern itself weighed LESS than an ounce! Of course they wouldn't take the pattern back for fear I had copied it and wanted to return it for a refund. It wasn't made clear that this was a pattern on line, and it was the only pattern amongst the REAL coat racks so I wasn't thinking of a pattern. So, for the first time, I felt I got stung as I will never use the pattern either. Oh well, you win some...you loose some! I didn't realize that ""Easy-Plan"" was a pattern!!! This could have been m,ade clearer by stating that it was a pattern for us elderly folk!"
2,Used DVD doen not work beyond a particular point,I was a little apprehensive about buying a used DVD and as I feared the DVD does not play beyond certain point.
5,Japanese Samurai Cinema at it's best!,"Those of you who remember a movie that was released in the states in the late 70's or 1980 called ""Shogun Assassin"" will have every reason to pick up this episode of the Lone Wolf and Cub series. Basically 80% of the bloodfest that was the movie ""Shogun Assassin"" was taken from this particular episode of Lone Wolf and Cub, Baby Cart at the River Styx. Even with subtitles this movie is still one of my all-time favorites. For years and years I had looked for the movie ""Shogun Assassin"" in video stores. When I finally found out that it was actually a part of a series called Lone Wolf and Cub, I went into a frenzy. When I finally put this gem into my VCR, I sat back with a deep sigh of relief, and watched with the same awe and amazement that I had the first time I saw this movie when I was 13 years old. It is a must buy for anyone who loves their Japanese Samurai movies with blood, gore, and believe or not, heart."
5,Animeigo Has Finally Released This On DVD!,"In case you didn't read my message under 'Sword of Vengeance', Animeigo has finally gotten around to releasing this title along with 'Sword of Vengeance' and 'Zatoichi Meets Yojimbo'. They will hit the retail stores later in 2003."
5,A Classic in Chess Education,"Chess for Children: Step by Step is a prize-winning book that has been translated into a number of languages, and with good reason. No better book exists to teach children the game and, equally as important, to imbue them with a love of a game they will enjoy deep into old age."
5,jazzanatomy,"I've been looking for a specific track on the album titled shade of jade, but I really like the whole album. I got a little more than I expected and it was great."
5,Among the greatest music of our time,"I am first and foremost a classical music lover -- in fact, until recently I have only listened to classical music. I have belatedly discovered the greatness of many movie composers, and of these I believe that Piovani is first among equals. His music is great music, perhaps the most moving music being composed at this moment. Moreover he speaks to all ages. My teenage son loves his music as I do. Begin with this selection of his music. Then let the world (and me) know how you react."
3,Finish not what I expected,"The finish is much different from what I expected. From the photo, I was expecting to receive a matte silver finish with clearly marked black lettering. What I received was medium dark grey, and the letters are medium dark grey. In a dimly lit machine shop, the lettering would be almost invisible. A few swipes with a magic marker will darken up those letters, but still. This tool is heavier and sturdier than I was expecting. The disk is practically 1/8th inch thick, and solid metal. I probably would have been happy with one of the cheap-o gauges from General, but why buy anything less than quality? For what I paid, that lettering should have been black enamel, recessed into the surface! Grrr ... where did I put that marker?"
4,Good measurement,"I bought this product at Amazon, and I satisfied with the exact and accurate measurement.I will recommend to my friends."
3,Up: A well paced dark tale. Down: Not the Master.,"Robert Poe pens a credible modern tale with enough supernatural undertones to tingle your spine but balanced with modern detective novel explanations whenever reason becomes over-taut. The allusions to Edgar Allan Poe's The Fall of the House of Usher are manifold and a pre-re-reading of that classic is recommended. Characters in ""Return..."" are well rounded, with one or two minor exceptions (the mob lawyer from up North) and the details of the plot ahead are never easily guessed although I saw some of the underpinnings well ahead of the central character, Charles Poe, but we readers aren't blinded by his fateful ancestry. What I missed in this story was the archaic (even in the 1800's) diction of E.A.Poe and his semantic mastery. Rarely in ""Return..."" is there a well turned run-on sentence or a sequence of multisyllabic verbage to cause a mental tongue twister causing the reader to pause, and consider."
5,Captivating,"This book had me hooked from the first paragraph. The fact that Robert Poe took a classic story and made it his own in such a unique way held me until the end. I like to re-read certain ""scary"" books during the month of October, and I plan on including this book on my re-read list. I love his descriptions of the impending hurricane and how it is incorporated in the overall theme. Great read!"
4,This is the SMALL size disk! There are TWO sizes.,"These are about 2-5/8"". Measure your suction cup before you order! These don't fit all gps's! For instance, they don't fit my Magellan suction cup, which is over 3"". They look good though, just too small for me to use."
1,Un-sticky!,"These discs DO NOT stick to curvy dashboards at all. It sticks on my window just fine, but I have the suction cup for that.The only up-side is that the plastic does not bend.If you have a dashboard that is not flat, do not get these. The adhesive is weak and will not cling."
1,Garmin Dashboard disk,Adhesive would not hold my GPS mount to the car dash. I purchased this product because of the Garmin name but I would not recommend it.
1,Not sticky,"I bought this product to mount my GPS to the dashboard. The disk was the right size, but I had to throw them away because they do not stick to the dashboard at all. When i peeled off the backing and placed it on my dashboard, it immediately fell off. Horrible product. I don't recommend it if you want something that sticks."
1,not sticky enough. We need to buy a glue.,"not sticky enough. We need to buy a glue.The product is just a piece of plastic without a paste, you can get any plastic and put a glue in it."
1,does not stick,"The glue simply does not stick to any surface and to the fingers, neither.Do not buy it! The original one is much better"
3,Ok,Ok its a plasticdisk blah blah blah blah blah blahblah blahblah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah hlah
5,As expected,"Two disks in the pack. One is stuck on the top of the dash of my truck. Has stuck well so far, so works as expected."
1,adhesive is a joke,"adhesive does not stick! Scotch tape would work better than this piece of crap. Don't buy this item, I'm returning mine."
5,Good Buy,I looked at buying these direct from Garmin but these were less expensive and work just as well. I would recommend to anyone whose dashboard will not handle the suction cup. Better and safer thsn sticking them on the windshield.
3,Garmin dash disc,"Did not stick to my dash. But my dash is not that smooth, maybe the texture was the problem??? I will add some 2 sided tape and see if that helps."
1,Don't waste your money,Had to send it back. It would not stay glued to the dashboard. It was a complete joke. Might as well put double sided- tape on the bottom. Would hold better
2,"Right size, doesn't stick","Plan on the adhesive not working and using a thin but good 2-sided tape. If you plan on that, better than buying direct."
1,Horrible! It doesn't stick to anything!,"I bought this thinking I could permanently mount the GPS to my dash. Turns out, it doesn't stick to the dash OR the window. I put it on in about 70 degree weather and it pulls right off by hand even after sitting for a while. Do not buy it. It'll cost more to return it than it did to buy it."
2,Not as Sticky as Original,The disk is fine but the sticky substance on the back was not as sticky as the the original disk.
1,Garmin dashboard,This thing is a piece of junk. I wanted to use it to mount my Garmin streetpilot to the rubber/vinly part of the center console which faces me ie which would suspended it.....i have a 2003 5 series...anyhow thing start to tear off afetr about an hr.....total crap....i would love any suggestions from folks who got it to work.
3,some what good but it did not work for me.,some what good but it did not work for me i tried to get it to work buy pressing so that my input .
3,Why is this priced so high?,"Amazon sells this for $18.99, but Garmin shows the list price as $18 (and they sell it online for that price). Amazon above list price? And for a simple flat piece of plastic? Ouch!"
1,Do Not Buy,"Do not buy for Street pilot C series... Also the adhesive that's not stick at all, save the money and time."
5,Flawless,"This is a very adventurous album - both lyrically and musically. Using diverse palettes to paint a lush sonic background, each track incorporates wonderfully unique harmonies and progressions.Joni's trademark truthful and honest lyrics are present throughout the album. Her voice is in its prime for this release.I think this album is the beginning of a real shift away from her more commerically viable offerings in '71 and '74. The timbre and chordal movement of this album are definately similar to Hejira, released a year after Hissing of Summer Lawns. I feel that these two albums represent the best of Joni's songwriting and overall timbre. I hope you enjoy this album as much as I have."
5,The 70's wern't ALL Disco!,"Hissing of Summer Lawns was my formal intro to Joni Mitchell...as a newbie teen. A fan was born! To this day...after listening to her incredible lyrics and music, I'm still sure that ""Hissing of Summer Lawns"" is without a doubt, her finest. It transcends the decades, as it were, and to this day can take me back to a moreso carefree period of my life and all at once...make me feel young again. Surely this piece of ""art"" can do that for any listener. This CD is timeless and is in a word...perfection!"
4,Most excellant,"Joni Mitchell tends to grow on you. If she hooks you, well than there is no hope. One album leads to another until got a good collection. This album tends to get overlooked. Blue and Court and Spark are often mentioned as her best, but this album is very listenable and has some gems on it, Harry's House, and Scarlett conquering, are just beautiful. The lyics,the voice, the instruments are all perfectly combined. If you like Joni, give this album a try."
1,The turning,"I had been a fan of Joni Mitchell for years when this came out and I tried to like it but was terribly disappointed. I am not someone who would complain just because this album was a departure from her folkish ways; I admired all earlier phases of her work, and there was something bold and different on each LP. Merely, I find the lyric writing here overwrought and the music weak and forgettable. The only brilliant track is the radical yet tuneful ""Jungle Line."" Obviously, there are many fans of this album, but I believe it's mostly appreciated on an intellectual level by people who can relate to the rather dismal stories on it. It's a bitter house of cards that randomly arranged music tries to hold together."
5,Part III of the three masterpiece albums!,"This is the third album in a superb set of Joni albums, ""For the Roses,"" ""Court and Spark"" and ""The Hissing of Summer Lawns."" This continues the jazzy tones of ""Court and Spark"" while keeping that lyrical flair and moving into different rhythms.The sounds on this album are interesting, the definition of instruments is becoming a little more fuzzy as the songs become slightly more experimental. This is a very interesting album and does take a little getting used to, it is not as forwardly personal or even as comical as ""Court and Spark."" I think some highlights are the title track and ""In France They Kiss On the Street.""Overall this album is worth having and continues the fabulous pace Ms. Mitchell entered the 1970's with. You can also see the direction she is taking with jazz."
5,The Hissing of Summer Lawns by Joni Mitchell,"Lovely, unique, inspired music by the one and only Joni Mitchell! ""Shades of Scarlett Conquering"" and ""Edith and the Kingpin"" stand out for me, but the whole CD is around a theme of women's lives, sorrows, artistic expression, performed in a voice and style unique to Joni."
5,Masterpiece,"Joni Mitchell's ""The Hissing of Summer Lawns"" is one of the most melodic popular music albums you could listen to. Amazingly, it was not well-received when it was first released, but I find the music to be timeless in quality. The music is a fusion of light jazz, folk, and pop, with very soothing vocals provided throughout, along with Mitchell's intelligent and insightful lyrics.Although ""Blue"" by Mitchell is often cited as her best work, The Hissing of Summer Lawns just sounds better to me - timeless and beautiful."
4,Poetry,"My bias is toward poets who are more direct in what they are saying. This work I found a mix of stunning and hard to grasp poems. Still, the poems that reached me were enough to make me want to read more of this talented poet."
5,"nice one, amazon","Amazon is just lame sometimes. I've been asked to write a review of this book. Review the NEC? Uh, ok. I'm an electrician, so I guess I really like the NEC. There you go, Amazon."
4,NEC 2005 Review,"There is not too much you can say about this book, it is the National Electrical Code. It is not a book that will teach you how to wire your garage. It will tell you the requirements for wiring anything. It is sometimes difficult to interpret if you are not a working electrician. It is THE reference book for wiring requirements."
3,Buy the Handbook,"For experts, the National Electrical Code is the absolute standard for electrical and wiring regulations. For other than experts in the field, the Handbook is a better investment because of the examples, illustrations, and diagrams of different regulations. The index of the National Electrical Code is also incomplete and difficult to use for non experts. Terms, items and topics that are definitely in the Code are not listed in the index. The most complete investment is the Handbook and the CD.Anyone who does purchase the paperback, standard version should also purchase the tabs."
5,McGard 27178 (M12 X 1.5),Purchased for my 2006 BMW 325 CiC. Works and fits perfectly for the stock wheels. Wheel lock head (black) matches the color of the stock bolts.
5,everybody must have these! very pleased with this purchase,I got these for my BMW along with another OEM set. Black head matches my wheels color and almost invisible that this is a lock bolt. Very recommended to anybody who afraid to get wheels stolen. The pattern on a head is not something common you see and since I got OEM set too these provide an extra safety because OEM uses completely different type of bolt lock.
1,DID NOT FIT!!,WHEEL LOCKS WERE CHEAP AND SHIP QUICKLY THE ONLY PROBLEM WAS THAT I BASED THE SIZE ON THE SIZE BAR AND IT SAID THAT IT FIT SO I BOUGHT THEM AND COME TO FIND OUT THAT THEY WERE THE WRONG SIZE THE SIZE I NEEDED WAS A 14 X 1.5.. SO MAKE SURE THAT YOU KNOW THE SIZE BEFORE YOU BUY DONT TRUST THAT SIZE BAR.
1,FALSE ADVERTISING,"This product is advertised as taking 4 60 watt bulbs, in addition it is in the product guide when you buy it! Well it is not 60 watt and as soon as you put in a 60 watt bulb it will dim to 40....Extremely frustrating considering the reason I purchased was because I needed the 240 watt lighting in the room!!!!!!!!Hunter 25748 The Grand Isle Four-Light 52-Inch Five-Blade Ceiling Fan, New Bronze with Frosted Amber Globes"
2,Not built for a longevity,"I've had this fan in my bedroom for about 4 years and have had to replace the remote receiver module inside the fan twice ($65 from Hunter). When this happens the fan will not turn on, it just hums a little. Not covered under warranty. For the price I'm sure there is much better options out there.I also have a Home Depot brand (Hampton Bay) fan I installed at the same time which was much cheaper but also has a remote. The remote quit working and they sent me new one - no questions asked. Also had an issue with the light holder on this one later - they stopped making this model so they sent me a gift card for the full purchase price 3 years later!"
3,it okay,this is kind of good but u got to buy this kind of battery nicd or the nimh that the only part i hate but it's okay i
4,Great Curriculum!,"I recommend this book to all who are looking for a curriculum that will teach children an overview of the Bible. It is great for a mid-week program and has lot's of ideas to teach a lesson and then review it in class using different ways to keep the students interested and active so the review time is fun, fun, fun! I would remind you that you will have to purchase another book in order have the activity sheets available and a 3rd book if you want to incorporate skits as a way to review! Over all though it is definitely worth purchasing the whole curriculum, it is a good investment"
2,Thirty Dollars for Three Days of Use?,"I ordered this pen and it arrived in a timely fashion, on May 26th. However, today, on May 29th, it started malfunctioning and now I can't even use it anymore. I'm currently getting it replaced. I've also noticed that other posters are having similar problems with the same malfunction with pressure sensitivity. If this is for more than recreational purposes only, I'd suggest finding it somewhere else. However, I am very pleased that I can have it replaced with no charge through Amazon."
4,"Great look at Vince McMahon, but hardly unbiased","It's almost a disservice to the word ""documentary"" to call this a true documentary on Vincent Kennedy McMahon. On one hand, it does a great job exploring many personal failures and his perspective, along with a good timeline of his wrestling character, but it never approaches the true aspect of ""why Vince failed"" on the XFL and many other fallen projects. It might briefly touch on it, mostly from only Vince's perspective, but you get the sense of a certain fear of making him look bad that went into the production of this."
4,Ya Don't Cross The Boss,"In McMahon, the WWE explores the background of the owner/chairman of World Wrestling Entertainment, Vincent Kennedy McMahon, and goes into his background, his family life, his wife and kids and his charitable work. That is his Vince McMahon side. His ""Mr. McMahon"" character is also profiled, with feuds with Hulk Hogan, Zack Gowan, members of his own family (Shane, Stephanie, even his own wife Linda), Ric Flair, Shawn Michaels, Triple-H and his most famous feud, Stone Cold Steve Austin. This DVD set profiles it all, and does a great job with it. I highly recommend this set to all who love to hate (or hate to love) the evil boss man of the WWE."
3,Its alright,"McMahon was suppose to be a great dvd, but ended up a dud. The documentary is long but nothing really new. Anther problem with it is Vince was getting big during the ""attitude"" era, and they blur the WWF logo out of everything with that logo on it and its annoying to watch a match during this era. Im very surprised they dont have his very funny promos on the set, which is why it makes this dvd not worth the purchase. Im sorry I bought it."
1,"I gave this DVD to my pet rotweiler, Bully.","This DVD is so much of a bad habit, it made me be lasy all my life so I had to get rid of it before something else happens like me getting face flat down to my own butt.So I hurled the disc into my dogs food bowl & he chewed like it was food.But now my life is back on track thanks to my dog who destroyed the DVD, yay."
2,made me remember why i stopped watching wrestling,the mr.mcmahon character i loved during the austin vs mcahon time but after awhile him and his character and the retarted story lines ugh pro wrestling is dead..its so embarrassing to watch WWE its sad the stuff they do..and how its such a freakin soap show with too much drama and anoying michael cole and the fake ecw..vince makes me sick with the storylines they did with the family so sick..but one good thing is now i know offically why he burried wcw
1,Only pansies would watch this kind of stuff.,"Note to people that are pansies that this DVD contains a lot of cussing, swearing, nudity package, anti-religioness, & of course violence & gore.Also note that this DVD doesn't contain nudity of girls, but nudity of a fat old gray headed man that loves making people kiss his big buns."
1,"Ha Ha Ha, at laugh at this guys face below me!","What makes you think that Vince could take on the likes of DX, huh fool! This old man can't do crap to them for your stupida** information!Also the only reason you worship to this guy is that, your a f***ing idiot! Cause all this guy cares about one thing in his whole life & that is, YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!!!!"
1,"McMahon sucks, period!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","Stop it! This has gone far enough of these kissa**ing people out there that like this man for nothing at all & why does he care for y'all? It's simple people, MONEY!!! I'm so glad that I reclensed myself with holy water & now all my sins has wash away. Also one more thing to add here is that:HEY VINCE, WHERE IS KURT ANGLE NOW, HUH? I KNOW WHERE HE IS BUT I'M NOT GONNA TELL YOU SINNERS ABOUT IT."
4,better than i thought,"i was a little doubtful to learn that plus one was now minus two members and switched from boy band pop to more rock...i definitely prefer the latter, but i didn't think plus one with three members and writing their own songs could handle it. i was wrong, because they definitely handled it, and well! i am VERY impressed by their efforts--only a little disappointed by the lack of much variety in the songs. they are all great-sounding, but sometimes they remind me of each other and all have the same general sound. there are no really catchy songs that stand out, and no quieter, more contemplative songs excluding the worship song ""here i am to worship"". other than that, i have no complaints!"
1,WHY???????,Please Can some one tell me why anyone would listen to this junk. Its just really really really bad. There like a christian version of the backstreet boys. Unless you like pop/rock/christian junk please do not buy this.
5,Grandawg turned me on to this...,"My grandmother, a force unlike any other, introduced me to this album soon after it came out. I was spending the summer with her on her farm, and after working all day, we'd sit in the kitchen, sipping something potent, and she'd play this. She liked it because the songs are about a woman who is strong, independent, clever and resilient. Joni sings ""I spring from the boulders like a mama lion."" My grandmother loved that. And so did I. Still do. She's been gone 4 years now, but I always play this when I go home to visit. And you should too."
4,A little disappointing...,"FOR THE ROSES isn't Joni's best album, but it is very good and has some essential songs. ""You turn me on i'm a radio"" is a classic that really kicks, and ""for the roses"" has a really beautiful but edgy melody--they're the two best songs on the album. ""A Woman of Heart and Mind"" has also become one of my favorites, and ""blonde in the bleachers"" also has grown on me the more I listen to it. My favorite part is when the rock-n-roll band starts in at the end. It just gives the song so much energy. All in all the album is a little weak, but the songs that are good are really excellent. Unfortunately, those great ones are only too few."
5,Amazing release from Aaron Sprinkle,"This Album is simply amazing, starting out it seems like it's ok, but once you give it a couple listens it will amaze you. The lyrics are well written and have meaning that you can connect with. Go pick this up if you enjoyed Poor old lu!"
2,Poor,"Aaron sprinkle's attempt at emulating emo godfather jonah mataranga is pretty obvious. Far and Fair are only a letter apart, and the sound is pretty similar. I can't imagine Aaron having the same success as Mataranga. Gratitude could beat anything Sprinkle does with one hand behind it's back, and that wasn't even Mataranga at his best. I guess it's true; for every secular act, there's a christian one doing the exact same thing. It's just too bad that they're usually not as good."
3,"""Fair""ly Boring And Repetitive.","Many of the reviews hyped this album, so I took the chance and purchased a copy. I will likely not listen to it again even though I continue to hear some of the songs from this album on one of those internet radio stations. The lyrics are decent, but the writers could not produce anything above average. Repetitive lyrics lengthened many of the songs beyond boredom. Many of the songs had an annoying, similar feel. It's not that Fair's sound is all that bad---merely average."
4,from across the country!!!,"another book I needed for Rutgers U. class. was posted as used and has a stamp indicating it was from UCLA bookstore. again, excellent condition. pages not written in or folded/torn. very good service."
3,Hmm...,"Silly me, I bought this book for the Patrick Woodroffe illustrations (being a fan of his 'n' all). Should have thought that one through. Alas, the piccies suffer from being on cheap pulp. Was there ever a hardback of this one, replete with full colour on decent paper, I'm given to wonder?So, probably not a fair review of a Piers Anthony title, I must admit. That said. I showed it to my daughter, and she reckons she's going to try to pick up a copy for her children, for something to read as well as look at. So, with a little bit of luck, a review of the whole deal might well be forthcoming somewhere down the line."
5,Loved it,"Gone with the wind sequel, very "" catchy"" kind of book that ""keeps you wanting to ""keep"" reading for hours..."""
5,Nice for Beginners,I may be too advanced for this title but I tried it anyway and I can see beginners liking it. The posture section I enjoyed too. Made me think about my allignment more. Nice DVD and not super advanced.
1,You Have Got To Be Kidding Me!,"Got some spyware on my cpu so a retailer suggested this product as it advertises right on the box: ""disable spyware."" Well I loaded it up and guess what? It didn't work at all. So I tried to get support and found out that I had to pay an additional $9.95 for this company to support this product. Then when I called, a recording told me no one was available at this extention, but I could leave a voice mail message. Obviously, don't buy this product."
3,Uneven but often brilliant,Very homiletical. Lyrical and smart. Theologically aware (if often Arminian and Neo-Orthodox -- expected for a United Methodist).Not a verse by verse commentary. Willimon often takes overly large chunks (as much as 2-3 chapters) and gives thematic insights. Often these are highly original and brilliant. Just as often they use the text as a launching point for pet topics that are not central to the text.No one should use this as your first overall commentary on Acts (John Stott is infinitely better for that). Certainly not the first commentary for technical matters either (try Bruce for that; or maybe Howard Marshall). Or even as the basic homiletical one (Kent Hughes is more consistent; even Boice is probably better most weeks). But it is a GREAT idea starter for the discerning reader. No preacher should be without it. One of the better volumes in the (highly uneven) Interpretation series.
3,A good place to start,"Wilimon does a nice job at opening the door to the book of Acts, this is a non-technical commentary and it does this job well. It is a good place to start doing research on Acts. It will not take you in the technical aspects of the Greek text, and will be limited in what it does with the history behind the text."
3,Unique perspective,"This commentary presents a very unique perspective on the book of acts. The commentator is quite opinionated. He does a good job bringing the interpretation of the book into the present day and you know exactly where he stands on every issue. However, this is double-edged. If you disagree with his position, which can be conservative or traditional at some points, you're not going to enjoy this book."
2,"To the artists, I'm sorry but...","These seem like very heartfelt renditions. I'm sure the artists on this tribute all love Uncle Tupelo as much as I do. If I had enough musical talent, I'd cover Uncle Tupelo too. But let's be honest here, nobody's going to do these songs as well as the band that wrote them.I enjoy hearing new takes on old great songs. And I've listened to this album several times. I really want to love it. There are a couple of nice arrangements on this album--""Graveyard Shift"" by Anna Fermin & the Trigger Gospel and ""Black Eye"" by Jason Wilber are two of my favorites--but none of them come close to touching the originals. If the songs weren't so great to begin with, this album would be one star. And when I listen to it, I find myself wanting--no, NEEDING--to listen to the originals."
4,Hard goin' wrong with these songs--and these artists don't.,"Admittedly, I'm an Uncle Tupelo junkie. I've bitten on all of this year's reissues like so many spinner baits. Heaven help me--I'm just not that bright.However, purchasing this UT tribute album makes me feel a little smarter. With only two to three exceptions, each of these artists stares down a Tupelo original with nary a sign of flinchage (Yes. It's a word. But, no, don't look it up. Show a little faith for once in your life.).Four artists particularly distinguish themselves and are therefore presented with Fat Carpenter Awards for (1)showing a lot of guts and (2)nailing it. They are: Mark McCay & The Bad Souls; Ed Petterson; Tom Roznowski; and Jim Roll.The keyword when considering purchasing tribute albums is usually ""BEWARE!!!"" For this one, it's ""PROCEED!!"""
4,"Classic Tom Waits, captures great live feel.","As a fan of Tom Waits earlier stuff, this was an excellent choice. Great recording, that captured the essence of a Waits' show. I thoroughly enjoyed this."
2,tinny disappointment,"i heard waits in nightclubs in the '70s just as he was breaking out & this was always my fave LP of his. when i sold my vinyl recently, this was one of the 3 or so records i had to replace with digital, so i bought this CD. it's in good shape, so i'm glad to have it, but NIGHTHAWKS is a sloppy, intimate record that benefits from the warmth of analog sound, pops & skips considered. i'm glad to have this CD for reference, but won't be listening to it for pleasure. the tinny '90s digital technology is most disappointing if you're familiar with this LP on vinyl. the seller can't be faulted, as the CD arrived pronto, in good condition, & as promised. & i'm sure audiophiles would have known how to have avoided my mistake."
5,This Is the Best of the Bunch,"Tom Waits was a blurr on my TV as I was channel surfing. Never heard of the guy. I switched back to the channel and was hooked. [....] I ordered Nighthawks and months later still listening to this CD. Nostalgic and humorous but Tom's storytelling and gravely voice are compelling and made me want more. If you ever spent a part of your life in a smoky lounge or a big city, you will become lost in the lyrics and in Waits smoky voice. He can call up images of late night coffeeshops and moments we didn't want to let go of. Like Truck stops and diners and sharing stories with strangers in the night. Follow up with ""The Heart of Saturday Night""."
5,Waites aims to inspire and please,"First time I saw Tom Waites perform was about 1975 or around that time, at a club in downtown Denver called Ebbets Field. He was the opening act for Kenny Rankin, another great talent. Waites' raw voice and connection with us in the audience left an indelible mark for me. I have enjoyed his albums ever since, but especially ""Nighthawks at the Diner. ""Big Joe and Phantom 309"" is still one of the most haunting compositions of all time."
4,Tom at his best,"Tom Waits is definitely best listened to live, and this album is the perfect example. The intimate setting, quirky intros and anecdotes make you think of Tom as an old friend -- or at least your drunk uncle who keeps telling you stories of his exploits in Tijuana. And yet you can't dismiss him as rambling, because each song goes beyond the one-liners and strikes a chord in you. ""Better Off Without a Wife"" is an ironic anthem. Underneath that cloud of bourbon is a razor sharp wit and keen insight. Wonderful."
4,a great sequal story to the first alanna books,"at first when i met kel i was somewhat skeptical about wheather she would be as good a protagonist as alanna was. i bought the book as soon as it came out, but it sat on my shelf for about a year and a half. then i finally decided to read it when Lady Knight came out, and once i started i couldn't stop. i finished First Test in two days, and then had to rush out to the bookstore to pick up the rest in the series. i only rated this book four stars b/c while it was GREAT, it was not the best Tamora Pirece book i have ever read, and the Protector of the Small series gets much better as you go along, my favorite book of the series was Squire. But thats just me."
4,Great intro to new character,"Once again I'm happy to be back in Tortall. A bit disappointed that Alanna doesn't get a more active role, but this is Kel's book after all. And it was a bit lacking in suspense (about whether or not Kel would get to return for a second year) since there are three books that come after this one. But the book was a quick read and a pleasant distraction from studies."
2,Not as nearly as good as the other books,"I found this book to be a real disappointment. After reading the Immortals and Alanna series and Circle of Magic, I was excited to find that Ms. Pierce was righting another series set in Tortall. There was no fluidity. The characters had no depth and the plot was thin. As opposed to Alanna and Daine who were great characters and had marvelous stories and lives. But this book lacked all that Ms. Pierce had shown great talent for in writing when she wrote the other quartets. I hope the next books are much better!"
1,New to Alanna and her World?,"I was and I had no clue what the big deal about the minor characters were. 5 stars? You've got to be kidding. The people were boreing, the setting was boreing, so the whole book was boreing. Get another book."
1,GRUSOME BOOK TO SLOSH THROUGH,"I was weary of reading this book to begin with. I've always been a strong Tamora Pierce reader, but this book is absolute trash to read. Perhaps I've outgrown them, but the writing style was simple, the story seemed rehashed from the other sequels, and I'm tired of the same old plot.Who wants to read the same story again, just replaced with different characters and a different cover. Speaking of cover, it's ugly. Who in the right mind drew that design and layed it out that way?! The Circle of Magic Series for the U.S.A had beautiful covers, but this one seems like a cover for a little childs tale for 4-8 year olds.Don't frett Tamora, I'm Still a fan (after two dissapointing books, the other being Briar's Book)."
1,Was this book a jest???(a disapointed fan),"I just don't understand what the big fuss was all about. Kel was boring and to humen. We read fantasy to get out of reality, not to be shoved into some pathetic girl's troubls!! Alanna's saga was 20 times better then this. here are my reasons: 1)Kel was cliched 2) no Alanna 3) plot? what plot? From the moment you read the summery you could tell what was going to happen. 4)it skipped around to much, one moment she's new to the palace, the next she' fighting in a battle. 5) What was with that whole ( afraid of hights thing) 6) Man! was she stuck up!! "" On the Yaminni Islands we do this,On the Yaminni Islands we do that"" I'm suppose to feel sorry for this girl?? 7) and just to rub your nose in it WHERE'S GEORGE???? I'll still continue to read this series if only because I have faith that Tammora will get better. I still think that the Song of the Lioness Quartet is 20 times better, God! even the Circle was better than this!"
5,the best yet!!!!!,this book is amazing! I couldn't put it down so read it in one day.it left me wanting way more!I can't wait for the next book!!!
3,Not one of her best,"I admit that this book wasn't too bad. It wasn't as winding and round-about as the Cirlce of Magic series, but I find that I don't like Kel. I can't relate to her at all. The Song of the Lioness and Immortals Quartets were much more entertaining. Nevertheless, I'll probably continue reading in hopes the series will improve."
3,unexciting,"I love Pierce's Trickster books, so I was excited to find this one. My excitement didn't last long. This book is flat and unimaginitive. In the two hundred-plus pages, the only real question addressed is whether or not Keladry will be allowed to continue her training the next year. (Keladry also has to figure out how to get along with the boys and stop some bullies, but the bullies' actions have so little effect on her [when they fight, she gets special medical attention; when they mess up her room, the maids take care of it] and making friends with the boys takes so little effort that this is a non-issue.) The focus on the gender issue at the exclusion of everything else makes the plot one-dimensional and Keladry seem whiney.I won't be reading the rest of this series."
5,I am so glad that Tortall is back!!,"For awhile, I thought that I was one of the only Tamora Pierce fans! Her books were difficult to find. Now, i see lots of people love her books as well! ""First Test"" was probably one of my favorite books by this author. It showed that girl's can do anything else that boys do. I ordered ""Page"" and can't wait for it to get here! One question springs to mind, 'Will there be an upcoming romance with her and Neal?' Considering the age difference of previous couples this is definetly not impossible. I can't wait to see how Kel's character grows in future books!"
5,GO KEL!,"GO KELADRY! YOU ROCK!(to say the least! ) Tamora Pierce has done it again. I love this book. And...Better yet...KEL IS NOT IN LOVE! SHE IS NOT BOY-CRAZY! AND SHE ISN'T HAVING ANY AFAIRS! I'm afraid Alanna had one to many for my liking. Although eventually...Her and Neal?...Anyway she is wayyyyyyyyy too young. And she should concentrate on being a knight. This is one of the greatest books Pierce has ever written. It is fabulous and totally AWSOME! I hope Kel's adventures will keep going on,and not stop at the end of a quartet. You should DEFINATLY(! ) read this wonderful book. I like Kel's personallity and her 'lump' like appearence. She is a GREAT, AWSOME, TERRIFIC heroine. Go Pierce and Kel!"
2,Won't stand the test of time,"I was about twelve years old when I discovered -- and fell in love with -- two of the books of the Song of the Lioness Quartet. Back then they were pretty hard to find, and I couldn't find the other two books until six or seven years later.Since then, I've tried Pierce's other series, and they just don't stand up to an adult's reading. _First Test_, like the Daine series, suffers from a distinct lack of subtlety, and I never felt drawn into the story the way I was with Alanna. Nothing much really *happens* to Keladry in her first year as a page. Which might be okay if we were given a deeper, more subtle look into her feelings, but instead it's mostly a repetitive, ""She tried to be stone, like a Yamani."" It gets old very fast.While this book may well charm younger readers, unlike the Harry Potter books or Robin McKinley's body of work, they won't stand up to reading by adults."
2,"It was okey, but where is the plot?","I was highly dissapointed in this book. After reading all of Mrs. Pierce's book( Alanna, Daine/Numair,and Circle) I was expecting something as much as exciting, but I was SHOCKED! To see her stories reduced into such dullness was painful.I mean, it's the same background and almost same situation, only this time, Kel get to go around all the tough stuff Alanna had to go through. It dosn't even match up with the title!! First test? what test? Personaly, I think kel is such a stuck up, Yamani island this and that and that. But otherwise I liked her determination and wise over her year. I'm still looking forward to the second one and the Circle Opens sequences. Please write more!!!! P.S- I want to know more about Daine and Numair.I really hope they get married :)!!! Keep'em comming, Mrs. Pierce!!! $;)"
5,Wondeful! Great! A must READ!,This is a wonderful book! I have read every book by Tamora Pierce and this is one of her best books!
4,In the footsteps of Alanna comes the First Test,I think that this series will be great. I have read First Test and it was good. The starting books are always the most boring... setting up for the future and such. I had hoped that there would be a series continuing Numair and Daine's adventures(PLEASE!!)! I would recommend this book for anyone that is interested in the genre and to those who have had prior experience with Tamora's works. It's a worthy read and I am at Amazon looking for the sequel! So go out there and get a hold of a copy! ~.^
4,Great!!,"This book is so awsome!! Kel is smart and hard working character. The only prob is Daine, Numair, Kally, Alanna and George aren't in it exept for breif apperiences. I know this story is about Kel, but we need the old characters too. Also time passes slowly. I mean at the end of Alanna's 1st book she was almost a squire. Keep 'em comin Ms. Pierce."
5,It's up there!,"When I heard about this book it sounded as if it would be the same as the alanna series. I was pleasently surprised when I read it . I liked it alot and cannot wait until the next one comes out. I have read all of the series and I think this one is right up there with the rest! I especially liked the fact that Numair and Diane were in it! I recognized many of the old charactors and was glad that they were in it. I thought that there would be more of Diane and Numair in it though. ""The Immortals"" was my favorite series and it would be wonderful for a series to come out with them together!"
2,Does not excell in my eyes.,"Eh, not quite the kind of material Pierce usual writes. Does not excell in my eyes."
4,Wake up -- this was good!,"Okay- I've read some of the other reviews, and don't agree with some. This WAS a good book! I was simply glad to see some of the familiar faces-- especially when the pages were fighting outside of Numair's quarters! No, Kel isn't Alanna or Daine, but her softness makes her real. Alanna had to have a different kind of spunk due to her secret. P.S. I'm sure the princesses and Alanna's kids would/will become pages -- when they are old enough! They are still too young, since only a year has passed since the war with the Immortals!"
4,Wonderful.,"This book was wonderful. You could definetly get different pictures that come to the characters. the book is about Kel who wants to become a lady knight like Alanna the Lioness. After a discussion with the king, they decide (the king and training master, Lord Wyldon) that Kel should be on probation, and if they feel that she will make a good knight, she might be able to stay. However, this wasn't guaranteed to happen."
5,"To the person who wrote ""too short""","I have not read this book, but i am planning to. I really can't critique it then, except to say that remember the first Alana book was like 100 pages shorter than the last Alana book. That and the book is for ""ages 9-12."" Don't loose heart!"
2,A Return To Tortall; not very interesting,"After all the begs and pleads to get another Tortall series, here it is! The first book! Not very exciting! I still prefer Alanna towards Kel, who was just too...cliched...and was the simple kid who somehow has magical powers with out ever being trained so. How unusual that Kel is the female that tries to be a knight, when she is so weak a character, how unusual, Tamora Pierce has dissapointed me. I hope the following sequels will be much more entertaining."
1,What a waste of time,"This book was so boring. It is a little dull girl who wants to be a courageous night. PLEASE! Kel is a bore. This book is writen for like kids in first grade! I hear all these ""Wow, what a great book!"", but that is just a bunch of lies. Another thing that is not very goodabout this book is that the way that the characters from the other series are not important characters. I was looking forward to seeing how things went for Daine and Numair, but they were rarely shown at all. This book was a major disapointment. I give this book two thumbs down!!"
1,Oh the horror . . . The absolute TERROR of it all . . .,"This book was sooo bad. It was better than the Circle of Magic series, but it still stunk up the fantasy section of the bookstore. Kel is a big dumb stuck-up moron, Neal is cliched, and who's the mysterious gift-giver? Alanna! Duh! I cried tears of joy when I finished this book. The second one is a wee bit better."
4,A great surprise,"Dispite my trepidation in reading this book I found that it was highly enjoyable. I was worried that ""The first test"" would be writen for younger readers (I'm 16), and that I wouldn't find the book interesting. I was wrong. ""The first test"" is a book that can be enjoyed by people of all ages, young or old. The book is well writen, with interesting characters (new and old), and an interesting plot line. These books are not just a rewriten collecting of the Lioness books either.Kel is a young Totalian girl brought up in Yamani ( a land where women are tought to fight), and when she returns home decides to become a knight. She is the first girl in Tortal to try after Alana's success 10 years ago, and must prove herself before she is allowed to stay for the full 8 years. She knows it will be hard, and it is. She faces bullies and hard work in her first year as she strives to become a knight, and to become accepted by her fellow pages."
3,I LOVED THIS BOOK!! 20 MILLION STARS!,"Tammy writes really good books! Why do you ditch on her? ~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Alright,now. Keladry is a really good character but i still say Alanna is better.Reason i gave it three stars and i loved it so much was because: A) WHERE""S GEORGE!!!! He has to be in the books! Not fair!::pouts:: B) No Alanna? How rude! Sure, Alanna is not..... can't say! SHE SHOULD BE IN THERE! C) Jonathan did NOT use his power as king! That ticked me off so i don't like Jon any more!"
3,I'm rather disappointed,"This book was an ""okay"" book, but not what I expectedof Tamora Pierce. I expected a gripping book equaling Alanna: TheFirst Adventure or Wild Magic, a book that I couldn't put down. First Test didn't meet those expectations. I'm hoping the other books in the series will be better."
2,BOOOOOOOOOOORING!,"This book is just more run-of-the-mill modern fantasy. Most books have something good about them, but not this one. It's basically Alanna's story (which was only slightly better) told all over again. I could not care less about the characters. I heard there is going to be yet another Tortall Quartet. Please, NO!!!!!"
4,particularly good for young girls,"This first book in a series, within a broader series, is quite enjoyable. Borrowing equally from books like Ender's Game (see Orrin's review) and The Deed of Paksenarrion, The Hobbit and Harry Potter (see Orrin's review), Pierce crafts an effective tale of children being trained for warrior life in a fantasy setting. The obvious subtext of female suitability for combat is less compelling. It is only plausible because of Kel's youth. The trainees are portrayed at a moment in life before they are truly sexualized and when many girls can probably whip most boys butts. Thus, the reasons for Wyldon's reluctance to train girls--their physical limitations and effect on unit cohesiveness--are not really implicated and his concerns seem somewhat petty, particularly in light of Kel's obvious competence. At any rate, young folk pining away for the next Harry Potter would definitely enjoy this series and young girls seem likely to love it.GRADE: B"
3,Hardly comparable to the Lioness Series,"While First Test whets my appetite for Tortallan stories, Kel hardly stacks up to Pierce's two previous heroines Alanna and Daine. Pierce you need to give her more character. She's too fluffy and stereotypical. The bully thing pretty much sums up how everyone feels about bullies... Give her some spunk and something to really be afraid of. Her mother has spirit... draw on her similarities with her mother. And give her a real test. We already knew all the trials she would suffer having followed Alanna through it. I want some real action. And with all the immortals walking around, let's see what really should be fought. It was a good read, but dragged having read the Lioness Quartet and Immortal Series"
1,You can't blame her for trying something new,"The plot of this book seemed so impressing and original, so I had expected a good read, put finished the book unfulfilled and wishing I hadn't read it. From the first chapter, you could tell that this was one of those books with ""unlyrical"" and bad ""word"" usage on the pages. Sentence forms were dull, there was nothing to use to imagine the green beautiful scenery that was on the cover."
1,I tried to like this book but...,"Peirce is annoying! I kept trying to like this with the character, but I found her to be selfinvolved and kind of irritating. Sorry. If you want to read an excellent fantasy read Alanna, Calling on Dragons, or Court Duel."
1,"""Protector of the Small"" was Boring","I didn't like this book. The story was just like any other story in a book. I still like Alanna better than Dania or Kel. If you have connections, it's possible to get the book."
5,Great book Tamora,"I'm a very big Tamora Pierce fan, and this book was great. My favorite though out of all of all of her books was the Alanna series. I can't wait for the next book about kel to come out."
2,Started Off OKAY For a fantasy Fiction,"I'll have to say that like any other book, the beginnings are always wonderful, in this case, it was outstanding. The only fault was that I didn't like the ending, everything was concluded, well, everything interesting. Now there's nothing to look forward to next.If you have connects, you can get this book."
2,Reads like a first draft,"I'm sorry, but it's true. It has the same plot as Alanna, except without Alanna's independent panache. The sentences are too simple--""Alanna the Lionness was in fights as a page."" ""Kel inhaled."" Kel's jokes have no snap, Joren is predictable and made of cardboard. Someone must have told Tamora Pierce upon reading about Keladry, ""She has to have a weakness. She's too perfect."" Accordingly, Pierce picked a one-dimensional ""weakness"" for Kel: a fear of heights, and Kel of course has to work to overcome this fear. It's so blatantly done that I didn't like it."
4,First Test,"This is a good book, but it starts out slow, so you have to get through the first few chapters. It is about a girl who goes to the royal academy, and trains to become a knight. There were few girl knights before her, and the general idea was that girls are these pitiful little creatures who stay home and sew all day. But, as we all know, women tend to be on the stubborn end of the gender pool, and so she withstood the boy's taunting and made friends among her fellow first years.Trevor"
3,Good but not enough action!,"Pierce has started a new series in Tortall again, but I found that the First Test was lacking the luster and action of her other books. Kel's unfair treatment caused some feelings to stir up in me. The story line is fairly simple and predicdable (c'mon you know she's going to be allowed to stay) but besides that it's a pretty good book"
5,"Great, but not the best","I really liked First Test. I liked the Immortals and Song of the Lioness better, but First Test is still amazing! I think I'm going to die before the next book comes out! One thing that's the same in all her series is the first book leaves you wanting more so badly you can't stand it. One question: In the second Alanna book, Alanna heals men injured in the war, in Duke Baird's camp. Duke Baird is already fully grown then, so is it the same Duke Baird that is Neal's father or perhaps Neal's grandfather? Or is Duke Baird just considerably older than Alanna? Generally, I'm annoyed at people who keep asking where George and Thayet are, since they no longer have any attachment to the main characters, but I agreed with the person who said Kitten was not something Neal would forget about. In fact, I don't think anyone at court would forget about Kitten! Maybe she's visiting Diamondflame (her grandfather) in the Dragonlands? It's possible."
4,Great Production,"Had never heard of Bobby Nesbitt, but the arrangements and production are so wonderful, I'm a new fan. I especially liked ""From This Moment On"" and ""Lullabye in Ragtime."" The male background harmonies are so perfect. I later found out that the CD was produced by Bob Esty of Streisand, Cher, Donna Summer and Weather Girls fame."
3,small enamel bowl,like the bowl. looks nice. I couldn't visualize size very well and so it's smaller than I expected. like the bowl.
5,Thumbelina: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack,Item was as decribed. New in package. No problems with the itemand very fast service.
4,Works like it says.,"This timer works like it says it does. I use it for a Lava Lamp at work. The lamp is to be on at most 10 hours at a time, it takes awhile to warm up, and there's no point running it over the weekend.The interface is for the birds. It works, and when you're reading the instructions, it's just fine. If you somehow get the manual and the timer separated, though, you will struggle to do anything with it besides switch auto/manual on/off."
4,"Extremely useful, if you know what it is for.","I am afraid that the reader from Jackson missed the whole point. He confesses that he didn't ""by"" the book, just downloaded it. The downloadable version has about 150 pages missing. The whole purpose of this book is to let you study the live code up close and personal. This is NOT a tutorial on how to use WebLogic, (how deployment descriptors are generated is not important, how you write EJB 2.0 compliant code is important). I was able to run all the examples without much problem. This book is an enormous value for money and if you are already familiar with 1.1, can get you up and running with 2.0 in record amount of time (WITH appserver of your choice, to boot)."
5,A must-own companion to the O'Reilly EJB book,This workbook is a companion guide to the book Enterprise JavaBeans (3rd edition) published by O'Reilly and written by Richard Monson-Haefel. This workbook walks the reader through installing and configuring WebLogic 6.1 as well as deploying the examples described in the EJB book.This is a very readable book that explains some of the WebLogic-specific requirements as well as best practices for dealing with EJB's (EJB 2.0 spec) in a WebLogic environment. I highly recommend this book for anyone working with EJB's on the WebLogic application server.This WebLogic 6.1 Workbook was originally published by Enterprise JavaBeans author Richard Monson-Haefel's Titan Books publishing company. O'Reilly bought the rights to publish it and order to open it up for a wider audience
4,Helpful guide to fascinating study.,I used this book along with the Lightfoot/Harmer/Holmes translation of the Apostolic Fathers. I found the format as well as the content to be helpful. It provides a more useful introduction than what is found in the translation. My one criticism is that it doesn't provide an explanation for for some of the more difficult passages in the Apostolic Fathers.
3,Great tracks; poor quality sound,"I agree with Jason below, this is agreat selection of tracks from my favorite reggae group. However, the sound quality is extremely poor. While it claims to have been digitally remastered on the cd cover it must have been done by Aunt Bee or Barney Fife because it's quite bad (especially the tracks from their Right Time release)."
5,"Great song, great lyrics, spritual and emotional feelings","I have the original album but on cd, I have no idea how it sounds like. Maybe Bunny Wailer should handle the technology transfer from album to cd."
3,"Interesting,but not essential, Space Rock relic from the 1970's","""Space Rock"" may be over simplifying, but likely the closest in describing this particular release and the genre in which it belongs. Maybe Space Rock with some mild Prog leanings would be more appropriate? It rocks pretty hard in places and is consistently uptempo, with Christian's guitar front-and-center, though having said that this is NOT a Heavy Metal record - Christian is obviously experimenting with many different ideas on his first solo release,some working better than others. Their is some sax used thruout, which I felt for the most part added rather than detracted.Overall a decent enough release from a time when musicians werent afraid to try different things,but nothing here would be what i'd consider to be ""outstanding"". A solid and respectable 3 Stars."
4,passion heart and soul,"This cd is great. I only wish the artist had more albums to choose from. It is a perfect cd to listen to when you want to unwind at the end of the day, or to just listen to in the early morning hours while you have your coffee and watch the sun rise."
5,James Patrick Dunne is incredible! It's my favorite CD!,"I've loved everything James Patrick Dunne has ever written and performed. His melodies are so beautiful and haunting! It's such a rare CD that you want to play over and over... You can't get these songs out of your head. This is a classic. How come my husband isn't like James Patrick Dunne? Sensitive, strong, and adorable!"
3,better than some,"it was ok. i had not read the other book, so i didn't know what to expect. i had trouble getting into the book. once there, it was ok. it didn't give that tension that really good books give where you're wondering what's going to jump out and from where. most of the books i read of this size take me 24 hours or less to read, this one took 3 days. i don't know that i'll read the 1st one or the next one, but i've read worse."
4,GREAT SEQUEL.................,"After re-reading the first book I was eager to read this book and see Jenks and his children and the rest of the gang. After finishing this book I think that she has a great set-up for future books in this series. After totally hating Trent in the first book I find that he may not be as he seems and in a way really likes Rachel. Glenn the new agent is cool and he looks to be a future partner for Rachel and love interest,MAYBE. Ivy, to me is a really cool person and is really trying to find way to get along with Rachel,and finally Nick, not sure what to think with him yet. She finally gets to solve a very confusing murders of five young witches and along the learns that things are not as they seem. Really enjoyed Jenks and his family and want to see more of them. I am eagerly awaiting for the third book called Every Which way but Dead."
3,This is it.....,"Ok. I find the main character frustrating at best. The way she continues to treat her friends just irritates the crap out of me. She endangers one's career for a petty reason and continues to trust one even though ever instinct is telling her not to. The author keeps harping on whether or not Rachel should share blood or sex with Ivy and quite frankly I don't care anymore. If she could just come to a decision I could probably keep reading but this seems to be a theme in later books as well. If I hear that they finally clean up her love life I might be interested coming back but until then, I'm done. Other people may enjoy it but it's just not my cup of tea."
5,Great Followup Book,I read the first book Dead Witch Walking and was totally hooked. The originality and creativity of this author is throughly refreshing. Definite read for anyone who can appreciate a twist on old sterotypes whether you are a sci fi fanatic or not.
3,"First part, so so, last part much better","Like for the first book of the series, the beginning was long and tedious and it made my reading experience looooong. After the 50% of the book, it became much more interesting and full of action. I don't think everything in the first part was useful to the plot. I still find the relationship between Rachel and Ivy exhausting. There's some light shed on previous events, but the whole thing drags in circles and it seems to go nowhere. The best development was about Trent and his nature and his past and I am beginning to like him.I didn't lose interest in the series, it promises a lot of action, especially as Rachel grows into her powers. The demon, Algareptiel-or-whatever, is an interesting character."
4,Rachel Morgan's saga continues...,"The Good, the Bad, and the Undead picks up were Dead Witch Walking left off. Rachel Morgan, former bounty hunter, has it pretty good. She left the corrupt Inderland Runner Service and started her own independent service. She's survived werewolves, shape-changing demons, and sharing a church with her vampire roommate, Ivy. But, Rachel's new found demon mark leaves her open to vampires pull.Rachel must confront the vampire master in order to save herself and the dark secrets she's hidden even from herself. This book was a good follow up to the first book. Interested to see what Harrison does with the rest of the series."
3,"good setting, daffy heroine witch","I love the world Kim Harrison created, but her heroine witch really grates on my nerves! How stupid is Rachel Morgan? She behaves like a petulant child. She never listens to reason, and acts like an idiot most of the time. And what's even worse is that she glories in her stupidity. I'm not even going to give any examples. People who've read the book will know what I'm talking about.But what saves the book for me is the neat world Kim Harrison's imagination created. I think it's really cool! Right up there with Laurell Hamilton's Anita Blake series (before all the cheap porn scenes, that is).I just wish for once that a similar series would have an INTELLIGENT witch/death-dealer/hunter protaganist instead of an impulsive, petulant little girl in a woman's body. A girl in a woman's body is a definite turn-off to me - it's just irritating."
4,Series just keeps getting better!,"As suspected, if I gave the second book in this series a try...I wouldn't regret it. This story just flows, now that I know the characters. It adds a lot of new twists and turns to the previous book, and the plot thickens. Love the characters: they are totally unique, and still mysterious as to what their relationship to the overall story will be. You think you have a character figured out, then a whole new way of looking at them is thrown at you. The story is dangerous, mysterious, and sometimes fun, with a hint of romance, but not overdone. Love the series now, and am going on to the third."
1,Disappointed Again,"I read ""Dead Witch Walking"" and was so excited about Kim Harrison's work. I am from Cincinnati and I was really looking forward to the familiar local of the novel's setting. However, that brief joy was ruined for my in ""Dead Witch Walking"" as well as in this novel. I think this series has such potential if Harrison would lay off the cliches and all of the Ivy-wants-Rachel-to-be-her-scion crap. Ivy freaking out and trying to murder Rachel every 10 pages gets really old, really fast. I adore Jenks and his kids, but I have difficulty relating to Rachel and the other characters. Harrison needs to make her non-human characters a bit more accessible to us human folk. I may give Harrison's work one more try, but if the next installment doesn't make some pretty big changes, I won't be reading anymore of them."
1,Why does Harper Collins charge more for the eBook version than the hard cover version?,"I read the first book in the series and enjoyed it. I'm not buying the second book until Harper Collins reconsiders its practice of gouging customers for eBooks. The eBook version requires no printing or shipping costs, yet the publisher still sees fit to charge more. The price should be substantially lower."
3,"Lazy writing, lazy editing.","I was was enjoying the books until I starting running into the ridiculous mistakes about items of common knowledge. Stuff that any writer should have taken 5 seconds to check, and any editor should have caught.1) Ferrets are not rodents. they do not survive on a diet of carrots and they do not have large incisors. Ferrets are carnivores, like mink and weasels, and have pronounced canines (fangs).2) someone described to be as petite as Rachel Morgan is NOT going to be putting a paintball gun in her waistband. Have you seen those things?3) If you inject a paintball with anything (breaking it's shell) it will leak all over and gum up your gun, making the whole batch worthless and the weapon ineffective.4) ""Loser"" was recorded by BECK, not Jeff Beck.5) Sulfur is not spelled Sulfer.And I'm only halfway through book 2.Annoying as hell, as it takes you out of the story to think ""WTF, how lazy can you get?"" about these items."
5,More Please!,"Remember what you thought your life was as a kid? Rachel Morgan gets to go to Night School and find out that her past isn't what she thought it was. Someone is killing Ley Line Witches and Rachel Morgan seems to have found herself near the top of the list. There is a nice sub-plot about a ketchup thief...;) Oh, and vampires, more vampires...among other things. Nothing I can say will match reading the book for yourself.Kim Harrison is more than a one book wonder and the evolving story of Rachel Morgan has me excited about book three ""Any which way but Dead"", due out in July."
2,It just didn't get me interested,"I started this book and the action was at the beginning. Then it started to fizzle. I got to about Page 100 and decided to put it down for awhile. This does have shades of Anita Blake. I love the paranormal genre but when story lines have the ""present"" time with just a few differences, I'd like to know what they are up front instead of finding out little bits and pieces throughout the text. Maybe a prologue could sum it up for me. There was alot of talking and not alot of action at the part I zoned out on. I'll give it a try later on."
3,Super Reader,"Let's see. You have dead vampire and live ones. That is one problem. Rachel has both kinds that want to shag her, bite her, do both, or some combination of them. This includes her roommate and her roommate's boyfriend. There is also a demon that wants to do considerably worse things than that.She ends up helping the human investigator types deal with a case that is out of her league, by going undercover to witch school, basically."
4,another great installment...,"this book is the 3rd of an excellent blend of horror, comedy and unlikely romance."
1,"I tried, really really hard But","I couldn't stand this book. I can't imagine anything so bland, boring and annoying. I'm desperately looking for a new Anita Blake story - no such luck here. Skip or borrow, don't buy."
3,"Fun, but akwardly written","I've read this book and the first in the series (Dead Witch Walking) and enjoyed them both to a degree. They are fun books, both with an engaging enough plot, but they both, unfortunately, read like the editor was drunk. In both, especially this second one, I found myself having to read entire passages several times to catch what the author was saying. It's as if entire sentences, or important sections of sentences, were cut out for no reason. If you're willing to read the book a few times to catch what's being described, I'd recommend the Rachel Morgan books. If you like understanding a book on the first read, I'd give them a pass."
4,More action in this second Rachel Morgan book...,"The first book in this seriesDead Witch Walking (Rachel Morgan 1)started of with a comfortable get to know you pace, the second shoots out of the cave like a bat out of hell. Fast paced with plenty of action this book also answers a lot of the questions left unanswered in the first one.Harrison manages to create characters that are memorable and fun. Readers of this genre will be used to the more heavy handed scenes that L. Hamilton comes up with, fortunately Harrison keeps it well within the comfortable boundaries."
3,Another Hollows I enjoyed,"Good followup to ""Dead Witch Walking"" we get to learn more about what is really Piscary's deal with Ivy and all. More Kisten is in this story and get Ivy and him bantering once again. Its kind of like brother sister relationship with these two. I like Jinx and his large number of children and I love that he lives in the same place as Rachel so hes always on hand. I still don't know who Kim Harrison does this but every book she writes just top to bottem with words. I would never be able to fills pages the way she does."
5,Can't wait for next book!,"Story just gets better. Characters are really developing. Finished this book and I am dying to read the next. Harrison spins a good yarn. I love Rachael, her friends and her enemies. Origional twist on the ""otherworld"". If you like this you'll also like Charlaine Harris, Kelley Armstrong, L.A. Banks and old Laurell K. Hamilton."
4,good healthy plant; strong; yet remember it's still a bonsai,"needs lots of care. FORGET WHAT THEY SAY ABOUT WATERING FROM THE TOP! The soil is packed too tightly. You must soak the entire pot in a container of water; at least three-quarters of the way up the side of the pot. Also, don't believe that your tree can survive temps down to 20 degrees. I live in central New York State. There be cold winters here! I almost lost my tree to frost bite from a sudden colder than normal snap. If you must bring the tree inside, make sure it is thoroughly watered often - at least every other day. I also almost lost my tree to extreme dryness when I had to keep him inside for over a week. Even if you can leave your tree outside during the winter, IT STILL MUST BE WATERED EVERY COUPLE OF DAYS. DON'T LET IT DRY OUT. DRYNESS IS A BONSAI WORSE ENEMY! However, this is a strong tree. It has even survived the winter of 2003-04!"
1,FALSE ADVERTISING.,"This is not an indoor plant, let alone a desk plant, even though my recollection is that it was advertised that way. It also does not look like the cute little manicured plant in the picture. Its branches go every which way, and many are brown. And as the other reviewer says, it comes packaged in a million styrofoam peanuts, which take a half hour to get out and another half hour to get into the trash. This one is going back to my friends at Amazon along with a request that they pay for the shipping."
2,A Mediocre Debut,"An unspectacular debut, this album suffers from a lack of memorable material. The playing is competent, middle-of-the-road, 70's country rock. Souther's best songs (""Best of My Love,"" ""White Rhythm and Blues,"" etc. ) appear on other albums. The best track, ""Run Like a Thief,"" is overshadowed by Bonnie Rait's better cover. Listeners searching for an overlooked gem should move on."
5,The time is now,"The time is now for all of us to come forward as one to claim our inheritance of enlightenment. Dr. Lee tells us enlightenment is already ours, we only have to choose it. We need only allow ourself to ""deprogram"" the old and let in the new information that will heal ourselves, our community, and our society. Dahnhak is one way to activate our choice and learn tools to actualize our inherent enlightenment. This book will bring hope and peace to all."
4,Disappointed in item,"I was very excited to receive this 8 pack gift pack as I love puzzles. I was disappointed to find that the pieces aren't fully interlocking and found that after completing one of the puzzles, there were 3 pieces left over and 2 ""spaces"" in the puzzle to put them into. No combination of those 3 pieces completed the puzzle. I am sure that this is just a fluke, but it did put me off the whole box."
1,Represented incorrectly,"I had to return this item, because it was represented on the website incorrectly. I was looking for the original beef recipe, not the new one, and was delighted when I found it on Amazon (both versions were shown as available). My cat has a health problem that requires this specific food. I compared the ingredients, the label, and all the details for a match before I placed the order. I was very careful. When I received the cat food, it was the new recipe (not what I wanted). Apparently, the old recipe is not available at all anymore, so the item should be removed from the website."
1,All 3 of my cats refused to eat it,This comes in a case of 24 so I bought one can locally before ordering the large amount. Good move! I have 3 cats and none of them would eat it. This review is for the mature gourmet beef entree. Haven't tried the other favors yet.
3,No driver for 64 bit Windows 7,I got good service from this printer until I bought a new computer with Windows 7 64-bit. Now it is impossible to use the printer and Konica/Minolta has not developed a driver for it. Do not buy this printer if you are using a 64-bit operating system.
5,Big bang for the buck.,"I'll make this short and to the point.Pros:1. Crisp, legible print.2. Low power consumption.3. Small footprint.4. Good build quality.5. Works without drama or surprises.Cons:None"
2,What Ever Happened to Plug & Play,"Have to agree with Jim in Alaska, Denis et al. I would stay away from this company. Nice printer, but a crappy company. You would think these dummies would want some good PR for their company; but they seem not to care. Gotta figure that people that neither care about their company nor their customers are not people worth buying from in the future. They deleted 14,000 forum comments asking for printer driver so PagePro would work with Windows Vista, 7, etc. Basically told people to go to hell. Could not even leave a helpful suggestion, or pay some programmer for a quick and easy Open Source software solution for their abandoned customers.I wish I was enough of a programmer to find a solution, but all I can say is that old HP printer works with XP and Vista, whereas Konica Minolta does not. I remember when Microsoft Windows was supposed to be plug and play, with generic drivers. I am gradually going more Open Source, so less has to go into the trash heap."
1,No support for Windows Vista/7,"Printer was great when used with Windows XP and Windows 2000 (yes, I had 1 machine which still was running Windows 2000). Upgraded the Windows 2000 machine to run Vista 64-bit. Poof - no driver from Minolta - customer service gives run-around if you try to press them. They kept saying that some HP drivers might work for this printer so unless this works don't bother with Minolta - go with a more trusted company. I can't believe there are no drivers for Windows 7 and Vista..."
1,Windows XP is last supported Windows operating system <frown>,"This is a great printer -- I have two of them. However, despite customer demand, Minolta has not provided updated drivers since Windows XP (32-bit). As a result, I and other Minolta customers will have to replace these prefectly functioning computers as we upgrade operating systems. <frown>"
5,Worth double what you pay for...,"I've had this printer for a little less than a year and have found it to be a truly excellent buy. I want to pat myself on the back for buying this thing. Razor sharp text, fast printing, and price are its strong points. Rickity paper/envelope feed, image quality, and toner price/availability being its major downfalls. In all if faced with the decision I would either buy this printer again or its newer more aesthetically pleasing younger brother, the Konica-Minolta/QMS 1350W."
3,Below average printer...,Got this printer thinking it's cheap from officemax. But it's not cheap. I would rather have another i320 canon instead of this one.I have spent around 2 hours and wasted 50 envelop trying to print out the address in it properly. Intially it was printing the from address in the wrong place. Now its stops the print midway. I don't know what is the problem.Networking possible with great difficulty. You cannot print more than one copy. You cannot do anything that requires the printer to talk with the computer. So it's a printer that can be put on network but it will not be a network printer but you can occasionally printout few pages..I don't know whether the printing cost with this one is cheap. I feel my i320 to be very cheap.
2,"Noisry, noisy","Bought this 2 years ago for under $100. I suppose I got my money's worth, but about a month ago it quit feeding paper. You have to push it to load the paper otherwise you get a fault light. That coupled with VERY loud cooling fan makes this a fairly undersirable printer. I thought the text quality was good, but it has too many drawbacks to recommend it."
3,Not Cocktail Disco,"After the brillance of Cocktail Disco, I was hoping to learn more of the disco progession of Dimtri from Paris. What I learned is that he has far reaching musical intersts and that Super Disco Friends is not merely an early draft of Cocktail Disco.Super Disco Friends is much of the funk version of disco. Of course, there are some cuts which do show the sensibility of Cocktail Disco. Super Disco Friends is a good work in and of itself if one is into such genre."
5,Highly Recommend,"This product is similar to the Hide-N-Sleep line of beds (alligator, fish). My ferrets absolutely love it. The bottom of the igloo is attached by velcro, one strip on each of the four sides. This leaves an opening at each of the corners that my ferrets prefer to climb through rather than the main opening. It's round-ish shape makes it very entertaining to watch when both ferrets go in and start wrestling, as the igloo will start rolling across the room. The quality is great. The walls are very thick, strong enough for my little one to climb on top without crushing it's shape. And although the bottom is only attached by velcro, they have yet to separate it from the rest of the igloo. Highly recommend."
3,Marshall Ferret Igloo,"My ferret loves it, it's warm and cozy. However there is a little flaw in the design: the bottom is attached to the igloo with 4 velcro strips that don't hold against a determined ferret. My little guy always manage to sepatate the pieces and I keep putting them togoether. The igloo doesn't have a hook to attach it to the cage, so he also drags it around.Marshall Ferret Igloo, Pattern Fleece"
3,It was definitely erotic but where were the vamps???,"At first I kind of felt cheated by this book. With the title and the cute cover I was thinking this would be a light hearted, maybe even funny vampire romance novel. Not so much. I hope it's not only me but this didn't feel very ""vampirey"" at all. It felt like an erotic romance novel that fell short on the storyline and character development. The heroine Jane (if you can go as far as to call her that!) was completely underdeveloped and there wasn't much about her to like! All we really know is that she had a rough childhood. Ok. Her and Rhys certainly fell fast and hard for eachother but... why? There was nothing that made me feel why they had to have each other so badly. Jane says she's in love with Rhys but all the 2 did was have a bunch of sex (very well written sex!) so really she's in lust? What? IDK. If you want a sexy, fluffy book with not much background or story then pick this one up."
3,Not bad...but was a little slow starting,"I think the psychological aspect of the story was a very difficult choice for the writer. She managed to make it work, but barely. The ending was good, but it was very slow getting there. I'll get the others in the series if they go on a gold box deal."
2,Not that great,"I read Christian's story first, really liked it, and was looking forward to the other books in the series. I'm in the middle of this one, and honestly, I'm not sure I can finish it. The heroine is so insipid--yes, she wants sex; no, she doesn't want sex. She melts at his kiss, repeatedly jumps into his bed, ""does the nasty,"" but then claims they shouldn't do it again. Ugh. I want to shake her, ""Make up your mind!"" If I were Rhys, I'd dump her. And the amnesia thing is getting old real fast. I'd like to read Sebastian's story, but after this, I'm not so sure. From the reviews, it sounds like it may be another schizo, wimpy heroine."
4,Thumbs up,"I overlooked this book quite a few times because of the silly cover and title, I don't think I will ever make that mistake again. Fangs for the Memories was a great book.This book had just the right mix of lovable characters, romance, action, and suspense. You get a great explanation and development of the main characters Rhys and Jane, and get to know them well throughout the story. The secondary characters are mixed in as to not steal the spot light but to enhance perfectly. We get a small background for each brother to set us up for their books.The plot and storyline was fun and very entertaining. There are many laugh out loud parts as well as those that just make you want to cry because they are so sweet and romantic.I would recommend this book to any vampire romance fan. I am looking forward to reading the other brothers' stories as well."
3,Fangs,"I did not like this book because it did not reach the dramatic climaz of the story. This book appeared as if the author was writting for the first time. Rhys being the oldest should have been in way over his head with his brother Christian as a foe, Lilah still trying to get her hands on Rhys. Somehow the story lost it's plot. Rhys had little part in the beginning. Sebastin had the greatest role in this book than in his own story (I Only Have Fangs for You) With Rhys being a Viscount some mortal should have been trying to take away Rhys legacy even though they were in New York. It is strange that Rhys losing his memory did not see the difference between New York of today and England of another period. At least he should have been qwestioning those changes not Sebastin. It was good that Christian was a foe to his brother, but there was not a scene where Christian was also trying to protect his brother. If, Sebastin had a connection to Rhys, Christian should have had that same connection."
3,All right....but less fangy then I hoped,"Maybe its just because I've been spoiled reading Charlaine Harris, Kim Harrison, and MJD but I found this book a little lacking in the suspense, action, and angst. The relationship development between Jane and Rhys left me satisfied and the love scenes were brilliant but it didn't FEEL surprising to me. I thought about purchasing the next in the series, especially because its about Christian who ends up being the semi-bad guy in this book but after a few minutes worth of deliberation I realized I need less NORMAL in my PARANORMAL romances."
3,"Good, quick read","The first book in this series is a fun, quick read with a few laugh-out-loud moments that keep you reading. If you are looking for a serious, intense vampire story, don't start this book. If you want a little fun and romance, try it."
2,"Romance novel first, vampire novel... third","Word of warning!!! This is more of a romance novel than a vampire novel. I wish that I had figured that key point out before making my purchase and diving in. And it's not that the author telegraphs each and every plot point in the book, but she does. Basically, if you want a kinky romance novel read this. If you want a vampire novel and don't want to know the whole story by page 30, skip this! As it was, I got sick of reading about the overly naive heroine and the brooding protaganist. BORING! Been there, read that many a time."
3,Fangs For The Memories,"A fun story. I like Kathy Love's slightly irreverent look at vampire love. Passionate and humerous, perhaps a bit predictable, but I enjoyed it anyway. All books in the series."
3,"Light weight, sharp, made in China","For the price it is a well made, light weight knife. Not as well made, however, as the other Buck ""Bantam"" models (viz., Buck 284BK ""Small Bantam"" which is a bit larger but is much smoother opening and feels more robust."
4,great small knife,"great small knife ,stayes sharp and total blade open is only 4.5 inches ,also easy to open and close ."
2,Too small and light to be of any use beyond opening boxes,The blade is decent but the knife is not comfortable in the hand.It cannot be opened with one hand so it is of no use as a backup tactical knife.It is stiff to open and clumsy to close.It doesn't even have a belt clip!I am disappointed.
1,Awful piece of junk!,"From the first day, this printer has jammed. It doesn't matter what paper it's using, it jams. And it's slow. The color ink? I swear there is nothing in the cartridge. Save yourself the time and energy and annoyance factor--buy something--anything--else!"
3,HP5940 for a Mac,"Prints clear photographs, but is very slow, particularly with PDF documents. Perhaps going through a hub slows it down, but my now defunct Epson used similar circuitry and was faster."
1,REFUSES TO PRINT CERTAIN PAPERS,"Disappointed to find that this thing refuses to print on our corporate stationery which we've been using for years with no problems with previous printers. So it's been a total waste of money for us. You might be lucky, but is it worth taking the chance?"
3,Cant quite figure it out.....,"I bought this printer at Office Depot, and I am a novice to say the least. First of all, I have no idea how to actually print pictures on this, but I am sure I will figure it out. There arent really instructions with it. Secondly, there is a footer page that prints after every print job that I cant get to stop. I even called HP and they dont know what the problem is?!?!? So after each page I print, a second page of thick black and light blue graphs print (what a waste of ink). I'm sure the printer is okay, but the technical support isnt really there for the technologically challenged.Feel free to let me know how to fix my footer problem!"
1,I hate this printer,"The paper feed is a nightmare. When it runs out of paper, it takes multiple attempts to get it to start feeding paper correctly again. It won't pick up the paper or it feeds multiple sheets at once. It jams constantly. I'd like to do an ""Office Space"" to it."
1,Not with a ten-foot pole,"I agree with those who say that this printer is a joke. It is without question the worst printer I have ever owned. I am now in the process of trying to get a refund from HP. The print feeder is simply abominable. If I had to use this printer for the rest of my life, I would go back to typewriters. HP should be ashamed to sell such a defective product."
4,Good Printer,"Have owned this printer since April 2006. We have only had one problem with it, and that was when there was a problem with the printer driver. Reinstalled the software that one time, and no more problems. It prints quickly, quietly, and color is good. We haven't had the paper feed problems some other people seem to have had, and I really don't know why, except that maybe we use 20-25wt paper. Only gave it 4 stars because of the driver problem, otherwise it would be 5 stars."
2,Paper Jam City,"Nice quality colored printing, but the paper feeder is a JOKE. Continual problems. Wouldn't Purchase Again."
1,Worthy of the JunkYard - NO STARS,"NO STARS ... Don't waste your money on this. Note the cheap price, you get what you pay for. The paper feeder barely works, most of the time I have to feed it one sheet at a time. I had another HP (very expensive) printer with the same problem. So I guess I am the fool here. Unfortunately, Carly Fiorina ruined what used to be a good company (HP) by cheapening their products to the extent they are purely throw-aways that stop working the minute the warranty expires. A total piece of junk."
1,Terrible printer,"My HP Deskjet 5940 is by for the worst printer I have ever owned. The paper jams constantly. It is impossible to run any job on it without the paper feed jamming at some point. Even using HP's own photo paper doesn't help.When it does print, the quality is very good. The ink cartridges seem to last a fairly long time, longer than the warning indicates."
2,Paper feed problem,I use this printer HP Deskjet 5940 on my Mac Powerbook. The print speed and quality is good but the paper feeder keeps jaming all the time with regular copy paper. It seems this printer only likes certain paper (lame). It is annoying clearing the paper jam and trying printing serveral times before printing. It seems like hit and miss with this printer. I guess you get what you paid for.
4,Has worked for me for quite awhile--but there are problems,"The DeskJet 5940 has been sitting in my home office next to my computer for several years now. It has never needed repair and it gets decent ""mileage"" from the cartridges. That is, my experience has been that the black and white as well as color cartridges generate quite a few copies before I need to replace them.The downside? As others have noted, it tends to jam--especially when I use recycled paper. However, I find it more an annoyance than a major problem (hence, the 4 stars).Overall, then, I have found this to be fairly dependable--but with the annoying habit of chewing up paper sometimes when the feed goes awry."
1,Where's the Software?,"This is a terrific printer, but HP hasn't updated the software to work with Windows 7. Ink levels and service tool connections that were orginally provided in the original software is inaccessible in newer opterating systems. And HP wonders why their printer business is falling off."
2,Would not work,We ordered a printer but it would not pull the paper through. We tried all the suggestions you gave us but it would not work. It was supposed to be a brand new printer but the box had been opened and resealed when it got here. It said on the box it had a digital camera in it but that had been removed. We then ordered a rebuilt printer as you were out of new and the rebuilt printer works fine. I am not sure we really got a new printer the first time. We are returning the first printer.Ric Elsworth
3,Great House Music,"Gwen Stefani may have heard this album before she went solo but just a guess. The beats are awesome but after awhile, it all sounds the same. Her lyrics are not that insightful but that shouldn't be the reason for listening to this. This is good shake-your-ass music."

1,que horrendo disco,esta vieja ni canta que caballota ni que nada parece un p**che trasvesti ademas ni sable hablar la vieja y todas sus canciones son de lo mas naco y vulgar que exista
1,Week,"There is no reason for this Remix. As I sit here listening to this Remix, I again fall in love with the original. There is no comparison. Each Remix is dull and repititive. I did try to listen to this with a open mind but they hype does not equal actual product. If you are looking for good music pass this up and just buy the original Begger Banquet."
1,Um...Why?,"Isn't the original song good enough, even for today's standards, or is this the only way for the Stones to reach the rap community. C'mon, you can't mess with greatness"
2,What the heck is this,"I bought this cos I like the stones. Not that much tho, and especially not this track. Its good but not a classic. Luckily I got it for 5$. ITS ALL THE SAME BLOODY TRACK done seven sodding times. After hearing it twice I'm getting ear ache. The first version of it done by the Neptunes is BAD and the guitar solo towards the end is like a knife scratching a dinner plate. Fatboy is slightly better. But you know when you like a track that is a reel classic and you cant get it out of your head this might be a good Idea, but sympathy is not that track.OK as an SACD tester thats all."
2,Well I liked it...,"We moved into our new house in March and now 9 months later, I've had to throw the flag out. Initially it looked great and my husband loved it. Yes, it's been left outside and yes we've had a couple nasty wind storms but I expected it to last longer than it did. The edge started to tear about 2 inches from the side. I thought I could sew it but once my husband took it down I realized it wouldn't be possible. I also realized that the S was starting to tear out and there were several other thin/torn spots."
2,For the inexperienced,"I was quite disappointed by this book. It really should have been titled ""An Introduction to Solaris"". For anyone who has experience in the UNIX world there is little to be gained from this book."
5,A book that makes unix friendly,This book covers in details a lot of Unix topics that I could not find in other Unix books. If you do not like to read lengthy descriptions then the examples presented in the book are sufficient to clear out a lot of useful commands. I use Solaris 2.6 at work and I find this book to be a useful reference for the different Unix related tasks I do at work.
2,"Only for newbies, who never worked with Unix at all","If you're already experienced with Unix in general - save your money, do not buy it. It is filled with information useful only for complete newbies (like vi commands, sed examples or basics of shell programming). I have found only a couple of useful Solaris-specific things in the whole book."
3,"A good idea, but poor execution","This book is loaded with quite a few free things to do in London, England. Indeed, they seem to be good suggestions. However, the book lacks an index, which makes it hard to revisit interesting ideas (what page is the Sikorski museum on?). Also, the book offers only the briefest of blurbs about each of the sites it suggests. This means that it is hard to tell what you are going to actually see."
2,"""Falcon Crest"" meets ""A Walk in the Clouds""","I work in a winery. This book describes the area and the industry as they were 100 years ago. This is the part i liked best. But the plot is just a soap opera, complete with damsels in distress, villains, rick bastards, etc. Do not read this book if you are planning your vacation to the Napa Valley :-)"
2,Huskless Popcorn,Not great...still husks...just a lot smaller and more compact. All kernels didn't pop either. Stick to Orville Redenbacher both for taste and quality.
3,Too small for the air popper...,"The kernels are too light and fly out of the air popper before they can get warm enough to pop...other than that, they taste good when they do pop..."
4,ok,"This popcorn was fine. But I recently purchased some Jollytime brand white popcorn at a local grocery store. Of course way less expensive than the price of this product. Jollytime was $1.50 for 2 lb bag and I'd say the quality and tenderness was about as good. So even though this is a fine product, don't think I'd pay this premium when I can get something pretty similar at the local grocery store."
5,Art of Touch,This book is about the very art of touch we all need. Includesvery good information about sexual health and very good to use as amaterial to be used for health education on health
3,Keep looking...,"I applaud this book for tackling such an illusive figure, however, there is little you will learn that you don't already know. As a lifelong Sean Penn fan I was hoping for more than what amounts to a thinly veiled gushing tribute to Mr 'Badboy'. Save your money for his movies!"
2,This guy won't go away,"Another book about a spoiled connected bratty actor who noone cares about. Oh good!! He's not enigmatic or elusive or anything. He's an above average actor, director...who has hyped himself to the point of insanity and has journalist friends put him on the cover of everything."
4,A Gem,"One of Marion's early albums, but not to be missed. ""Asha"" is one of the most intoxicating songs ever played by anybody on the sax or not. Full of passion and mood, it is an inspiration for the soul. ""Forbidden Fruit"" is infused with Asian-style tones mixed with sensual feelings. ""Nocturnal Serenade"" is an artistic high."
4,Collins in folk mode,"Judy Collins' simply titled fifth album seems downright subdued next to some of the ones immediately following, with their increasing diversity of styles and instrumentations. Some of the songs here are accompanied solely by her own guitar playing, and none have more than a small band as backup. The choice of songs very much reflects the tenor of the times (1964) with several of the songs being strong pleas for civil rights that, alas, still seem relevant today, while others (""The Coming of the Roads"") are very forward-looking in their expression of what are now universal ecological concerns.There is superb material here, as in all of Collins' albums; the moving ""Thirsty Boots"" and final, rousing ""It Isn't Nice,"" taken from a live concert, are particularly memorable. These two selections also illustrate the superb quality of the instrumental playing. The weaker songs tend toward the overly repetitive. Still, in common with all of her output, this is a quality album."
4,Make sure to buy another cartidge!!!,"We got this toy for our 9 month old daughter for Christmas, and she loves it. She pulls herself up on the block, dances to the music, and loves the mirror and other little activities. However, the music it comes with is extremely irritating (to me, not her). We are purchasing the Bach cartridge, which should be more pleasing to mommy's ears! Also, the snatches of music the block plays on each side are relatively short, and you have the give the block a good whack to make it play again. We got this toy because our little girl loves to stand up and play, and it is terrific for that purpose. We did not hold the illusion that it is educational, despite Neurosmith's claims. If you want to teach your child about music and your child is old enough, definitely get the Music Blocks instead of the Jumbo Music Block."
3,Ev-Ry-Where - YouLookYouSeeA - Sware!,"Yes, it bothers me that ""square"" sounds like swear, but that is the only glitch with the otherwise great sound quality. We have the jazz cartridge, too, but prefer the built-in tunes which sing about the shapes. We got this for our daughter on her first birthday, but she doesn't play with it a whole lot - and she just turned two. I think she is just not the right personality for sitting down to open challenging flaps. We are still glad we bought it, though. Any child who visits our home is drawn to it, and it has held up GREAT. I like how little ones can stand up with it, and older ones can toss it around, or even sit on it (not recommended) without damaging it! Even though it is cloth, it has not gotten stained or dirty, and still looks new."
3,Where's the music?,We received this toy as a Christmas gift for our daughter. We all gathered round to watch her play with it and we were all very disappointed that there was no music cartridge that came with this toy. NO where on the box or instructions does it say cartridges NOT included or sold separately. The way it is marketed as a music box is a little misleading. I have purchased a cartridge and she does enjoy this toy now that we have everything we need. It really looks alot more impressive than it is.
4,"A great, unique and creative toy","This is a really cool toy for a 1 1/2 - 3 year old or so. When you hit the top of the block, it plays a very well recorded song (yes, recorded) about the particular shape that is facing up. It is very soft, yet durable, and the shapes all open up in different ways to reveal someting underneath. The only ""beware"" is for adults- the songs will stick in your head after hearing them 100 times!!"
4,My kid LOVES this one,My son loves this toy. It is not too big or annoying at all as other parents have stated. He has learned all of his shapes from it and loves all the songs. He cracks up when mommy and daddy sing along and dance with him. I would recommend it for a great gift idea. My son recieved this at his first birthday party and still plays with it at two.
2,Big and Boring,"I was fascinated with the idea that my 18 month old would like this toy, but he didn't. He looked at it once, and never again. It got more use as a stepping stool in the kitchen than it did as a play toy. I found it complicated for a 1-2 year old to figure out, and boring for a 3-4 year old to play with. I have since passed it on to relatives."
2,"Too young for a 1 year old, but........",This toy is very rarely played with by our 1 yr old but our 6 and 8 year old love the thing and I think that once our youngest gets to be about 2 yrs old he will probably love it.It is nice in that he can pull up on it and if he falls he wont hurt himself because it is so soft. The tunes are addictive and you will find yourself singing them in your head until you can't stand them anymore.Overall I would say it is a bit pricey but fun
5,Great Toy!,"My daughter loves this toy!! It's one of her toys that she plays with and plays with and never gets tired of it. The concept of the music matching the shape that is facing upward is great, and all the activities associated with each keep her very entertained. The toy is also very durable. Her cousins who are quite hard on it haven't hurt it a bit. All in all a great toy."
2,Not fun and expensive,"I purchased this for my daughter when she was 16 months old and she initially found some interest but not much. I have a couple of the cartridges as well and changing these did not encourage her to play with it. A couple of months later she played with it, but only to climb on it. Now at 21 months she doesn't even look at it. I probably wouldn't complain as much if it was not so expensive."
3,not the play!,"I had gambled that this DVD was a video of Aristophanes' comedy Lysistrata. It is NOT. While there are clips, and while it is a worth documentary about female power, it only has some short clips of the production.Had there been a description, and did not emphasize its actors on its cover, I could have saved the time and money."
5,Great Audiobook,"I purchased the hardcover first and found it to be pretty slim on actual content for the price--the posters really didn't add a whole lot to Maher's commentary. The audio book, narrated by Maher, is delivered in his dry comedic style and as such is much funnier. Maher is, first and foremost, a comedian, and this book has to be heard to be enjoyed."
4,Still relevant,"I read the book when it first came out. Just finished listening to the CD.Altho I don't agree with a few of his points, this is still a good read/listen."
4,"Great Songs, but no dialogue","When I first saw ""One More Time,"" on Cartoon Network, in 2001, I was so intrigued by the anime, that I couldn't stop watching it. I had to have the rest of the story and the music. This one has it all, great music, great story, but no words, or dialogue to the movie. Now I have to admit, some of the songs on this DVD, were just too good to stop watching, while the others were just didn't have any singing to the music, that was a major drag, but if your interested in DAFT Punk, and you like anime, then this one is for you."
2,This has to a mistake...,"First of all, nothing wrong with the film itself - it's quite enjoyable for me.That said, what were they thinking, putting out such low quality video on a bluray? I was in SHOCK to find the video not fitting my wide-screen. With 480p looking video quality, I thought I was looking at a DVD. Are they gonna say that they used up all the space on audio, because this is clearly a waste of bluray space. My Mazinkaiser SKL DVD looks much better than this and that came out only few months ago!And bonus feature makes no sense - no descriptive captions attached and very lacking in terms of feature.There is no way they can justify their above $30 price tag. I might formally complain to EMI."
2,Will not play on US Blu-ray players.,"I love DAFT PUNK: INTERSTELLA 5555 and took a shot with the Blu-ray even though I was aware of other reviewers' concerns. It would not play on my new Sony Blu-ray players. However, it did play on my Region free Blu-ray player but was not HD impressive. The case says the disc is 1080i25; a format I am unfamiliar with. My processor read that it was 1080p50. I noticed a lot of artifacts, even after processing to 1080p60, and am disappointed with the disc as a Blu-ray. I hope that a better Blu-ray release for Region 1 in 1080p24 will someday materialize."
4,Very excellent and unique,"I never owned the CD by Daft Punk. The only songs I knew were the singles that were played on the radio. This movie is truly an impressive piece of art. Even songs that are rather boring are exciting simply because of the story telling on screen. The songs fit so perfectly with the action visually, even on instrumental songs. You can read the other customer reviews that say all I think, so I'll talk about something else on the DVD:The sound itself. The DVD has DTS and Dolby Digital. I've only listened to the Dolby Digital so far, but it's safe to assume DTS wouldn't be totally differant. I was a slightly dissapointed (only because I was perhaps overly expecting more) that the music itself doesn't take advantage of all five speakers. Instead, the music is basically the same old two-channel stereo mix from the CD. The use of the rear speakers and the center speaker are when there are sound effects onscreen, which are rare."
4,Good Buy,I loved the music videos from the first four music videos. And i was surprised to discover that Daft Punk and Leji Matsumoto had completed the whole movie with the music. I wasn't expected what i saw and i love it. I put it in now in place of the cd. But of course i Loved the cd first. I think it is great and if you are a daft punk fan this is for you. It is a must. Leji did great on the animation for the movie. Go out and get it it is a must for any anime and daft punk fan!
4,Worthwile purchase,"Daft Punk - Interstella 5555 is generally a good anime backed by good electronic music. Both elements are a hard to define. The anime has a late 70s art style, but there is no spoken diolague. So the story telling relies on gesture and imagery. The animation quality starts off good, but 'flash backs' in the later chapters make it feel a little cheep. The music follows a similar pattern. It starts off with daft punk's a-list tracks, but towards the middle of the movie the tracks just are not as strong.The only other dissapointment would be the extras, which essentially do not exist. There are some sketches, some backgrounds, but that's about it. I wasn't really expecting any more than that, this being a daft punk item, but I would have liked moreWeakness aside, the movie was worth its price. It tells a simple but fun story with great retro characters and stylish music. I've used it on by big screen as wall candy during parties."
3,a missed oppurtunity,"Well I just got done watching this and I must say I am a little suprised by all the hype surrounding this movie. First things first, I have been a daft punk fan since I was a teen and theres no falting the excellent music on this dvd, the story however is well, a different story. I found it to be a little confusing at best and a little dull at worst. The animation is fine but nothing to do back flips over. I guess I was just excpecting alot more. The concept of doing a whole movie to a daft punk album is quite brilliant though, and I did love the ending."
5,"""The Wall"" for a new generation","Leiji Matsumoto has masterfully crafted an indictment of pop stardom and what fame really means. Using the DAFT PUNK album ""Discovery"" as a brilliant musical backdrop, Leiji takes you on a sci-fi trip of stardom, fall from grace, loss, and the eventual recapturing of the soul.The ending of this movie will leave you in tears of joy and redemption.This is a masterwork, and a masterpiece."
5,Secretly Incredible,"This DVD is incredible, it matches the great synth of Daft Punk with beautiful japanese animation. If you love the Discovery Album by Daft Punk you will be knocked off your feet when you watch this dvd because it places the music so in sync with the movie which makes it flow very nicely.Reccomended for anyone who loves Daft Punk or Japanimation in general."
4,Good buy for the die-hard daft fan,"Interstella 5555 is a fantastic tale of a musical group from another planet who get kidnapped by an evil human manager, blah blah blah world domination, blah blah blah. The point is, this is a DVD that contains videos for ALL of the songs from Daft Punk's Discovery album. If you like Discovery, I recommend Interstella 5555. With the trippy lights and musically-charged emotions, this is a DVD worth multiple viewings. Check it out."
1,Blu-ray not recommended,"I bought the european version of the blu-ray and it just didn't play well, the image kept freezing up and the blu-ray player making noises searching information on the disc, as I could perceive the image quality is not at the blu-ray level, I'll return it to the seller and buy the DVD version instead."
5,Absolutely Perfect,"As a huge fan of Daft Punk (probably my favourite band), I first saw this DVD several years ago and it never gets old. It is a combination of a phenominal album and high-budget anime at its finest.The storyline, although simplistic, is easy to follow and the characterizations are superbe.The attention to detail is second to none, as every scene is well developed and matches up to the soundtrack perfectly. I can't imagine anyone evry being dissapointed with this DVD."
5,Daft Punk at its most Daft,"The Video is great tells a story of love , life ,sacrifice, home and music."
1,"Decent audio, HORRIBLE video.","The audio is still superb, and the film itself is quite good.But...At first I was a bit sad that they kept the 4:3 format, but alas, it's the original release screen format, so why should they mess with that (I can hear some Kubrick fans applauding), but then... it's the worse blu-ray I have ever seen. It's like a low quality DVD pressed into a blu-ray format disk. It's horrible. I've seen online clips with better video quality. I'm so disappointed and frankly I'm shocked they would release it as is. Worst - blu-ray - ever."
2,"Poor Quality, Good Movie","Just to get this straight, the only reason I give this two stars instead of one is because this is a good movie (for Daft Punk fans) and I hadn't owned the DVD.That being said, if you own the DVD, skip this purchase. The 'HD' is more like an upscaled DVD rip. I was looking forward to good bonus features, like interviews with Daft Punk, but they are not here, and the menu for the few bonus features is very confusing. At least on the PS3 I played the movie on, there was no text to describe what the bonus features were. Just a bunch of boxes that did different things.I'd say get this if you don't have the DVD, but try waiting for the price to go down. I'm a huge fan of Daft Punk and I kind of regret the purchase."
1,UGLY!,Do not be missled by the picture. This bracelet is large and uglier that it shows. Looks juvenile and cheap. Not worth the money at all.
4,a good book,"After reading the other books in the Smallville series, I was not pleased. They are nothing like the show. But even though thats true, I decided to give Hauntings a chance, and I'm glad I did. This is the best book in the Smallville series by far, it is about a haunted farmhouse, and a Mayor's past. A good book, if anyone else has read the Smallville books and has been disappointed, hopefully you will enjoy this one."
1,"Holder doesn't ""Get"" Gray Characters","Nancy Holder has a real problem with ""gray"" characters. She didn't get Spike in her Btvs novels, and she doesn't get Lex in Smallville. I really think she would be better served sticking with series where all the characters are clearly labeled ""good"" or ""evil"". If you like Lex, you won't like this novel. In fact, if you like the ""gray"" morally ambiguous characters in any series, you should probably avoid any tie-in novels by Nancy Holder."
3,Hauntings,Hauntings was a good addition to the series and one well worth reading. The only reason I did not rate it a four is because the book was slow at points and unlike the first two books in the series I felt the Lex Luthor character was not as strong in dialogue. If you've read my reviews on the first 2 books then you will realize I hammered the Clark character. The author did a much better job with Clark in this book and it was very true to the story and characters. Definitely worth reading and I would say is one step behind Dragon but better than Strange Visitors.
3,Needlessly repetitive,This was a good book which could have been better given the compelling subject matter and the author's front-row seat. He could have used a better editor. The unabridged audio book was read by Scott Brick who helped me get through the author's meanderings.
5,A Poignant Account,"A well-written memoir, an eye-opener to those who had never been to China and an appetizing read for me who had first-hand experience of what it's like to live and work there. This, I could read and reread every few years, satiating my desire for Zhong Guo's landscape, culture and food. Peter Hessler is a wonderful writer who can easily transport the reader to China's River Town."
5,Excellent Book,"I loved this book, i didnt skip any pages and was laughing out loudly at some of the names (Coconut, William Jefferson Foster, George Baker Frost).Peter Hessler is an excellent story teller."
5,Good coverage,I enjoyed this because of a trip taken on the Yangtze not too long ago. Many things were made apparent through the descriptions Peter Kessler included.
5,Hessler,"15 years after Hessler's tenure in Filing his observations of Asian culture ring true. Upon recommendation, I picked up Rivertown as I wanted to poke through for his account of teachingEnglish overseas. I am now finishing up my own year long teaching post at Mae Fan Luang inUniversity in Chiangrai Thailand and I couldn't help but understand exactly what Hessler was talking about in each of his cultural encounters.Thoroughly enjoyed this read."
5,A must before doing the Yangtze,"I read this book after coming home from China and doing a local boat trip on the Yangtze, travelling on the trains and public transportation from Hong Kong to Beijing. It put me right back into the real China. I could see, hear and smell the cities, towns, farms, boats and people. I will re-read this book many times. Thank you Peter for writing this momoir of your time living there."
5,Totally Fascinating,"As research for a fall trip to China, I chose River Town for an American's perspective on the Chinese. What started out as simply interesting reading turned into totally fascinating insights on the land, its people, and their thoughts. Hessler seems to be at his best when attempting to decipher the Chinese mind. This is the most stimulating book I have read in many years. I will be giving it as gifts to many people."
5,China books,Brilliant account of life in China in a small town before foreigners became more 'accepted' as part of a developing country. Having lived in China for 3 years I can see so many parallels even now in 2011 and it continues to develop fast as we all know. Read it as a prerequisite to living here!
5,The Best Non Fiction Book I've Read in a Long Time,I've recommended this book to a lot of people and purchased it as a gift for a student who spent a semester in China and a public school administrator who introduced a Chinese language program in a public school. This book gave fascinating insight into the Chinese culture and made me laugh and cry. Wonderful!
5,"Great writing, interesting story","I found this to be a very interesting peek into the modern-day culture of the other ""super-power."" Hessler packs magnificent descriptions, funny stories, and astute observations into this book. It makes me want to visit China, and also to learn more and understand more about other cultures. I think Hessler is a wonderful writer."
5,The next Peter Mathiessen,"If you're a fan of visual travel writing, in the style of Peter Mathiessen (The Snow Leopard), you'll probably enjoy this book very much, although the ground it covers is semi-urban China, rather than the wilds of Nepal. Hessler has an exceptional eye for detail and a strong ability to bring the reader into the sensory experience of China."
4,River Town,I found the book to be very interesting and an eye opener. I found the author to be an excellent writer - great use of words and his expierences.China is certainly in the midst of change. I came away with the hope the change comes slow or the world will have to deal with a situation even worse than that we have in U.S.S.R. / Russia. The book speaks to the people - the difference between so many different groups.The town descriptions were outstanding. Great book.
5,One of my favorites,"Others have already provided in-depth reasons as to why they rated this book five stars, but these are mine:1. Hessler's work reads like a suspenseful novel; I couldn't put it down for several days and learned a good deal.2. Hessler never comes off as remotely condescending toward the people of Fuling, which is unfortunately more than I can say about most authors of travelogues.3. Hessler includes excerpts from his students' essays, letters, and newspapers that communicate more about Chinese culture than could any formal history book.I am currently reading another of Hessler's books,Oracle Bones: A Journey Between China's Past and Presentand recommend it to anyone who enjoys River Town or any historic nonfiction."
5,"Two Years in Fuling, China","I enjoyed this book. It was valuable because it gave an entertaining and informational perspective on rural China in the late 1990s by an outsider. The author's knowledge of the Chinese language allowed him to vividly portray the conversations and his daily life as a teacher in a Fuling high school. He included snippets of essays and thoughts that his students had written for his class on various topics, giving the reader an insider's look at the opinions and feelings of the growing educated Chinese middle class. Had the author of spent two years in Shanghai or Beijing or Xi'an his experience would have likely been much different. It is because of his willingness to spend two years in central China among the hard- working people there that makes this book different. It is a great memoir, travelogue and personal reflection that anyone interested in China should read."
4,Rivertown: 2 years on the Yangtze,"Peter Hessler is a well-educated Peace Corps volunteer who was sent to China to teach English at a local teacher's college. He very vividly captures the ups and downs of his experience for 2 years beginning in 1996. He was sent to Fuling, a primitive city, where the people are not familiar with Westerners. Peter describes his unusual experiences in the first person as well as giving the reader a glimse into Chinese thought, language, politics and culture. The book is quite interesting although it sounds like a documentary."
3,Not to my taste,"River Town is not particularly well edited travelogue, but full of useful and interesting detail. My problem is that I'm not sure I even liked the author."
4,Good Travel Writing,"I originally purchased this book because of my interest in the Peace Corps. It is more than just an account of life as a Peace Corps volunteer, it is an account of life in modern rural China. I did find it a little slow moving but such is the life of a Peace Corps volunteer and it is a good read nonetheless. This is a great book for anyone interested in China or in travel writing."
5,River Town: Two Years on the Yangtze,"River Town is a very interesting and informative book, well-written and accessible. I read it in anticipation of going to China and I'm glad I did. I liked it enough that I immediately began reading Hessler's following book, Oracle Bones.The fact that it was written by a well-educated man, still in his twenties, gave his observations and the recordings of his experiences a unique perspective. He is writing about China today, and the history included is that affecting people's lives now."
5,River Town,"Reading this narrative, one feels a sense of both Mr. Hessler's sense of adverture and his eye for detail in all things. His sense of humor is crisp and dry. Having just returned from China myself, I can vouch for his extraordinarily accurate descriptions,even in spots where the armchair traveller would shake his head in disbelief. And I was immediately transported back to the Yangtze River--I could smell it, see it, and observe the uniquely Chinese character of everything around. His ability to capture the essence of Chinese personality and expression while avoiding stereotype is amazing. When I left, I thought that there was something, well, different about all Chinese, not a racial thing but a cultural and perhaps historical thing. But I could not really say what it was. Fortunately for me and for all readers who enjoy travel and cultural subjects, there is this book."
4,"Easy, Interesting Read",Interesting peek into Chinese life. Four stars because I left wishing for something a bit deeper. Highly recommended.
5,Wow.,This bracelet is lovely. The style is simple and elegant and for a small wrist a neat fit -sometimes hard to find in a cuff bracelet . I bought it a few months ago and did not review and felt compelled to do come back and review.
1,"dissapointing, too concentrated","much too concentrated and undrinkable out of the bottle. not exactly spicy, just like drinking a peppered concentrated tomato juice. wish i could return it!"
1,Disappointing strong taste,I didn't like this product - it was overpowering with horseradish flavor. I am a committed bloody mary drinker and had asked a restaurant what product they used. They told me it was this one. It didn't taste anything like the restaurant bloody mary. i ended up pouring out the bottles.
1,Very Watery,"I gave this as a present to my father-in-law. On the positive side, the order went through fine and I received the order quickly. The downside is that the mix isn't very good. It's fairly watery, a little sweet, certainly not the World's Best. I should have suspected something was amiss, especially with a name like World's Best Bloody Mary Mix. Just can't trust anyone these days, guess I won't be buying Honest John's Hair Regrowth Syrum now."
3,You sure it's Matthew Fox?,"There is very little likeness between this figure of Jack Shephard and Matthew Fox the actor who played him on LOST. The facial expression is kind of ridiculous with his mouth hanging open and I don't think we ever saw him make that face in the ""Pilot"" episode. The lack of instructions on how to put the display together is also a problem.If I didn't like the show so much I probably never would have gotten this figure. On the plus side, once the figure is assembled it looks cool. The background is nice, the detail on Jack's suit and the base are excellent, and the box plays the sound clips loud and clear. It's a display only figure (nothing action about it) and for the fan who has bought all the other figures already."
5,Great for all ages,"My son started playing this when he was 3. At 4, he can name all the states, abbreviations, capitals and most of the state birds. He can tell you where the major points of interest are without looking at the map. It helps to teach the concept of distance, such as ""which state is closest to Maine"". It also teaches the concept of compass direction, such as ""which state is north of Texas"". The game can be played with or without a board for portability. All in all a great educational game for children as well as adults."
1,Wrong Answers!!,My 8 year old daughter LOVES this game!! However... we have come across numerous cards with incorrect answers on them. (Example: What are the two states that start with the letter O? Answer: Oregon and Ohio. Last time I checked Oklahoma was still in the United States.) I am very reluctant to keep playing this with her as I'm wondering how many other answers are wrong that we don't know about. My daughter decided to write the company an e-mail and nicely tell them about the issue and received no response. I am very unimpressed with this company and will not be purchasing products from them going forward.
5,What a blast!!,"We LOVE this game! I have to agree with another reviewer; get ready to learn how little you know about the USA! Our seven year old happens to love geography and is really learning lots of great facts about our states. I truly feel this will help him in school. In agreement, as well, about the cheesy spinner and timer; the spinner constantly gets ""stuck""..you have to sort of pull it up through the cardboard in order to get it to work (9/10 times when spinning, which is a bit annoying). And I have my doubts about how accurate the timer is as well. All in all, I would recommend this game its educational qualities and it being tons of fun at the same time!"
2,disappointing,my nieces opened this game on christmas and pieces were missing...when amazon sent me the replacement i couldn't have been more disappointed at a game hyped as award-winning but with no direction or point and the girls quickly became disinterested
4,"Good game, could be better quality though","We have enjoyed playing this game and it is very useful for learning a lot about the United States of America. It comes with a timer, but we have opted to play without it as it is only useful in remembering information and has no real use for the learning part. Once we learn more, then we will enjoy the added excitement on being timed for the answers. Our kids have benifited a lot from this and it's prevented them from getting discouraged.The game also helps you learn the abbreviations of each state as well as the capitals and largest cities.The playing card sets it comes with are the lowest quality I think I've ever seen. Seems like just big cardboard cutouts rather than real ""cards"". At the cost of the game, I was surprised to find such flimsy cards.But that is the only negative we could say. It's a fun game to play and we would still recommend it."
2,"Great Idea, Poor Quality","Wonderful concept, unfortunately made cheaply. The timer broke within 5 minutes of first use. During our first game we found errors on four of the question cards. The colors on the cards don't match those on the board which makes identification of state birds frustrating to impossible for young children. What a shame quality was not an objective in the production and how misleading the Oppenheim Toy Award is in this case."
5,exciting information about how new think,"I thought this book would be bogus-- a flimsy theory with little substance. but I was wring. It is very scientific, and extremely accurate. I draw on what I learned about how my brain works -- which I learned from this book-- almost every day. I highly recommend it."
2,From Back Cover,"Matt had never met a woman who didn't succumb to the McCafferty charm. But beautiful Kelly Dillinger proved indifferent to his attractions. Although they didn't get along, her all-business attitude pricked his ego...and fired his blood. The more she resisted, the more determined he became to break down her defenses. For the lucious lady detective touched his soul, and there was no way he was going to let her get away without claiming her as his own blushing, breathless bride...Second in The McCaffertys series."
1,non-story,"This book is a disappointment to say the least. While it does give the reader a very predictable romance, it never resolves the ""mystery"" that is supposed to be part of the plot. As the lovers decide to marry - ""against all odds"" that they would be attracted to one another - they end the book committed to trying to find out ""who did it."" It's a non-plot...sorry I spent money on it."
4,A tribute to Mount Katahdin and Baxter State Park.,"Connie Baxter Marlow has put together a tribute to Mount Katahdin and Baxter State Park. The people of Maine have a right to be proud of their mountain. This is not a trail guide to the mountain but rather a presentation of its flora and fauna. The photography is very good. However, the text tends to the mystical. This is not a total surprise. Mountains like Katahdin that stand by themselves tend to be regarded differently from those that are found in mountainous regions. For example, Mt. Shasta which looms over Northern California, just as Katahdin looms over the center of Maine, is the subject of legends about lost civilizations. However, this book is worthwhile for its photographs."
5,Love it,Love it perfect DVD love this old tv program my dad love it Becouse he had a white horse perfect condition
4,Good Solid Disc,"Michael Henderson is a Great Talent.His Work as a Writer,Arranger,Producer&Instrumentalist is Incredible not to Mention as A Vocalist.This is a Good Solid Disc.Michael Henderson is Very Underrated."
1,Short lasting batteries,"I purchased these items from another source. When I wanted to use them, two years later, they were dead! Apparently these batteries do not have any shelf life. From now on, i buy major brand batteries with 5 year + shelf life"
2,Can't understand the instructions,Have been unable to use the GPS to find out how many miles I've hiked on trails in the mountains because I don't understand the instructions.
4,Good solid unit,"Nice unit, locks on fast and keeps the signal, it even worked inside my house. The base map that is loaded isn't much and only has some cities. The Garmin web sites indicate a ""Marine Data Base"" is loaded but I can't find it and we have a number of buoys near our house. It does have larger cities loaded. The Trip and Waypoint Manager software is pretty weak and I had problems getting it to load on my XP machine. Good crisp display and many options for the displays. I upgraded from an old Garmin and I would recommend this unit for a non-mapping use."
4,Good BASIC GPS,"This is a good, but higher level basic GPS. Picks up satelites reasonably well, except in heavier tree cover. Clear and readable display. The unit performs as advertised. What I don't like about it is the 1MB memory limitation. I'm interested in downloading National Park topo maps and the 1MB memory limits me to one quadrant in the typical western US MapSource Western National Parks. If your one day trail spans more than one map grid or if you plan a multiday hike you are out of luck. I'm not a geocacher, so I was looking for the basics -- altitude, direction, track some of my way points. The maps was a nice to have. But once I started playing with them, I liked them and wanted to use them more. That's when I ran into the head room issue. So I upgraded to the GPSMap 60CSx -- more money than I intended to spend, but....4 Stars because of the memory limitations. If that is not an issue for you, then 4.5 stars."
1,This is a hoax.,"This DVD is free through Disk Makers, so do not purchase it. It actually is not mastering tips but someone from Disk Makers attempting to sell their mastering service. I'm apalled that someone would list this product for sell after receiving it free (and for over $100 - you've got to be kidding me)."
5,Great Raggedy identification guide.,"This is a great identification guide if you are interested in finding out more information about your dolls. This book goes into detail about the years each doll was issued and the country or company that made the doll. The book also is a good reference for accessories, books, games and toys, and holiday or birthday items. I have used this book so much for refenence that it is literally falling apart. I have ordered a second one for my reference library. The prices are realistic for the secondary market. I would also highly recommend Joyce Gerardi Rinehart's ""Wonderful Raggedy Anns."" In addition, I understand that Jan Lindenberger has just released an updated version of her ""Raggedy Ann & Andy Collectibles"" book. The first edition was a great reference and I look forward to reviewing her updated version as well. I am sure if you purchase this book you will enjoy it and you will want to identify each of your dolls."
4,A Fun and Fast Read,"I've always enjoyed Resnick's books and this was no exception. While I don't think it's in the catagory of some of his other titles like Paradise or A Miracle of Rare Design, it was a fun book all the same. The story is very enveloping and the writing is, as always, well done.It's more of a mystery novel and I found myself staying up to find out what was going to happen next. I thoroughly enjoyed this book from cover to cover. Even the rather dated science of computer technology added an element to the story I really liked.Not the top notch story Paradise was, but definitely a fun and fast book."
4,Military Mystery,Almost no science fiction there. A detective story written in Resnick's fluid style which keeps you engrossed until the end. An agreeable read.
4,A Review of this Book,"I read this book last night. I enjoyed it completely. It was a strong book overall, but there was one problem: my copy was missing every page after 270, without an ending. In fact, the last word was not even complete. Luckily, I got the rest of the book, but when I finished it, the ending seemed weak. I mean, come on, ""Then Becker... _really_ went to work."" That has got to be the worst ending I've seen in a while. I still recommend the book though. It is relatively realistic, funny and serious at the same time, enough to make it a book that I didn't want to put down."
2,Disappointing,"This book gripped me from the very first page and as I read on, it actually began to scare me, which is pretty hard to do these days. I almost dreaded turning each page, in fear of what might happen next. But as the pages waned and I saw that I was close to the end I started to become perplexed. I prepared myself for a slam-bang ending, only to be severely disappointed by the climax and ending. What a letdown! I couldn't believe the author had copped out this way. I'm just glad I hadn't bought the book! The two stars I gave it are only for the scare it gave me--for a while, that is."
1,Not the book you think it is,This is NOT Sophie's World: A novel about the history of philosophy. THAT book is fantastic. This book isn't it.
4,For girls who are young at heart,"This book is about a young girl who is not quite ready to grow up, who often feels misunderstood and who struggles to ""fit in"" with her seemingly fickle and shallow peers. The author does a great job of demonstrating the positives of having a ""child-like"" attitude and creative nature. This book would be great for all young girls between the ages of 12 and 14 who find the transition from girl-hood to the teenage years challenging. Review from Jennifer Slattery, author ofJourney To The Ice"
5,"{The Best, cool, fun, outgoing, girly, Book!!!!!}","If or if not you are a Christian, read this book! It is about a young girl, Sophie, who dreams up her own little worlds, & she has NO friends. Her parents get mad because she gets a lot of C's & D's on her Report Card! They won't let her dream during class & on and on. Then, she makes a friend that likes to dream to! They help each other out The whole year! They stay clear of Corn Pops & Fruit Loops! They make their own club, the Corn Flakes!This is book strong with friends forever!"
2,Silly theology,"I'm disappointed. I wanted to like this book.This brief quote from pgs 79-80 will give you a concise look into at least two or three aspects of the book's flawed view of believers' relationship with Jesus Christ.... Sophie closed her eyes and imagined a quick glimpse of Jesus. He was smiling, kind as ever.""OK"", Sophie told herself, ""As long as we're more good than evil, we'll always be all right.""If you and your parents are comfortable with that, maybe this book will be fun for you."
5,"FAST delivery, and a lot cheaper than the $25 the appliance store wanted to charge...","This is exactly the same 3-prong plug my appliance store charges $25.00 for.We bought a range, which of course didn't come with a wire & plug.While standing inside the store, I pulled up the Amazon app on my iPhone, found this and ordered it.Exactly the same, but 80% cheaper than the appliance store's overpriced profit-maker..."
3,Moongobble and Me,"Moongobble and Meby Bruce CovilleDo you want a jolly good book to read about a wizard who makes stuff into cheese? How about reading about a wizard and his helper who go on a mission to get golden acorns away from a dragon? The wizard is Moongooble and Eddy is his helper. If you want to read about their adventures pick up this book.Herbie, Age 9Cunniff ElementaryWatertown, MA."
5,Excellent for younger kids,"I read extensively at night to my 5 and 6 year old boys. There is a trend for kids' book series to have small handsome volumes with clever illustration, like Spiderwick and Lemony Snicket. I had to edit out some disagreeable words in Spiderwick, and have decided to forego the Series of Unfortunate Events until they are older. And some of Bruce Coville's books like the Magic Shop series don't really make comfortable reading for very young kids. This is what makes Moongobble such a joy. Following the example of Spiderwick these are nifty little hardback volumes filled with winning illustrations. The stories are aimed at younger readers and my boys (beginning readers both) like to flip through the books themselves. In The Dragon of Doom, my boys really got a kick out of Moongobble accidentally turning everything into cheese. They also liked the talking toad."
4,Excellent Live Texas Blues,"Johnny Copeland was one the best blues guitar players who even a lot of blues lovers didn't know much, if anything about. Like most blues greats, he was at his best on stage. This is an excellent example of his fine guitar work, not to mention his unique vocal style. About the only thing wrong with this disc is it's length, a little under 40 minutes, probably because it was issued on vinyl first. I didn't let that stop me from purchasing it, and you shouldn't either. Johnny was equally adept at bluesy ballads (Baby Please Don't Go) as he was at up tempo jams (title track). An excellent addition to any blues lovers collection."
5,electrical code changes,"Have to have this to keep up with electrical code changes to keep my LLE license for TN in good shape, the code changes could cause you to fail an electrical inspection."
4,great book to start with,"its a good fast glimps into the NEC code book, its a lighten up version with a more down to earth view. maybe one step closer to the students then the code book it self. however i just had to buy the NEC code book because this is not as comprehensive. its hard to find fault in a good product and it is what it is."
5,As described,This is what my boyfriend wanted for christmas. He was pleased and I was pleased so it must be good!
3,I didn't pick it but I could have...,"This is a book for a Book Discussion Group and given the reviews and all, I can't blame the group, but had I read it first I wouldn't have recommended it. Too long, too much pointless sex, too much that has nothing to do with the plot nor even character development, unlikeable characters, (men & women alike) and too choppy. I've never liked the stories which hop around with the unconnected characters each getting a chapter. At first I liked it since the main character seems interesting and it's fairly well-written, but after a while I just wanted the story to progress: get on with it!!"
3,Ordinary,"Book of Air and Shadows promises more than it offers. There are no superheroes here, just 3 guys from 2 different centuries sort of bumbling their ways through tricky sets of interrelated circumstances. The uneven pace of the book derives from the soliloquy-like musings of each of the men over their own personal foibles and shortcomings. The action scenes, on the other hand, are more compelling, and the intricate plot does succeed in keeping the reader guessing. I was hoping for more adventure and less (much less) angst. Still, Air and Shadows is entertaining, and certainly illustrates the passion that the Catholic/Protestant conflict brought to ordinary lives. The author's portrayal of Shakespeare was also refreshingly human. Though not perfect, this book is worth reading for what it does well."
3,Not the best,"Well, I have to agree with the other less ""stary"" review. I didn't care for Jake either. I felt the language was course, even ugly when it came from Jake. I liked the other characters better, particularly his brother.I felt the story bounced around too much. Like the sequel to a great movie, instead of going for a great script, they opt for the 10 car chases with explosion after explosion. I figured out the plot long before I should have been able. All in all, it was readable but I wouldn't pass it on to anyone else."
3,Not another DaVinci Code,"With a gift card from Barnes and Nobel burning a hole in my pocket I bought this book on the strength of the outside cover and reading the first few pages while in the store. It was also my first experience with Michael Gruber.Generally I thought the story was interesting. There is some interesting informaiton about intellectual properties law and the story is engaging, however, for the most part I found this novel a little too long. I managed to finish it, but don't think that I will bother with Gruber again."
3,A Michael Gruber fan,"First, a disclaimer... I am a Michael Gruber fan. I find his writing generally tight, witty and I especially like the way he develops deep, layered characters in his books. So far, the best of Michael Gruber are the early novels by Robert Tanenbaum, the 'Butch Karp' series, which were in fact ghost-written by Gruber. As he has moved off to develop his own name as an author, one has the sense he is still reaching to find a group of characters as engaging and enjoyable as the Karp clan. The Jimmy Paz books were good, but not great. This book is a decent read, thanks to Gruber's craft as a writer, but, in the end, forgettable. Characters are ho-hum and the plot is formulaic daVinci Code imitation. Gruber's still in there, though, and I'll read his next book and the next after that, hoping he finds his stride again!"
5,"To new depths -- err, heights!","From the same pen that dressed novels in voodoo (Tropic of Night and Valley of Bones) comes The Bard, redux. Thank you, Mr. Gruber. I enjoyed the entire weekend because of Aire and Shadowes.I look forward to your next effort."
2,Bad Novel from a Good Writer,"The characters are self-centered, dull, and unlikable. The labored storytelling never gets off the ground. The plot is ultimately incoherent. For a fan of his previous work, profoundly disappointing."
2,I'm so disappointed,"First, let me say I have not finished, because I am really having to force myself to get through the first 75 or so pages. This is incredibly boring, but after reading other reviews, I'm encouraged to try harder.I really loved his first three books, and the last ended with the impression that a sequel could be on the way. Regardless of any sequel, I ordered this as soon as I saw it available, without reading any synopses, because his other books were so great.My bad---although I probably would have gotten it anyway, regardless of synopsis.But his other books were terrific. Great page-turners, and a great capture of Miami. In understand an author gets tired of the same characters, but he really had a good, creative and imaginitive thing going.This one just drags. The characters have not capured my interest at all.But I'll keep plugging away......"
3,Book Got Here Okay...But Not as Promised,There were many pages that had markings (underlining) which was not disclosed in the description of the item.
2,Might have been.,"This was a good idea. The Bracegirdle letters are the best part. Then the plot becomes boring, very boring and then deadly boring. The plot would have been better served if the novel had avoided the sexual incidents page after page after page."
1,Save your money and time,Page 93. That's as far as I was willing to waste any more time waiting for this book to get to be worth reading.
5,Excellent (if long) literary thriller,"Starting with possibly the worst first 30 pages to ever grace a thriller (hang in there, it gets better very quickly) the rest of the novel flies along from one scene of action to another. The ""letter"" that holds the storyline together is one of the few things that slows the book down (""we thinke allst that thou needeth was akin to...blah blah blah"") but it is certainly interesting, and one twist after another (some entertaingly preposterous) remind you of a smarter Dirk Pitt...you'll thoroughly enjoy this literary thriller - even if its sometimes a rough go."
2,Could have been good...,"After finally finishing this messy, plodding, self-conscious book, I read reviews by others, including the biggies...Washington Post, etc. It seems that everyone else loved this book that, for me, fell so far short of air and shadows that I was tempted to skip the ending and move on to something better. The topic is compelling. I'm a fan of the literary thriller in general and this could have been really good; that is, if you took out all the dull character studies where, I swear, I could hear Michael Gruber thinking of ways to sound intellectual and profound. It was Dan Brown with a broader vocabulary and a bigger ego. Yuck. A waste of a good idea."
2,The Book of Hot Air and Implausible Plots,"I listened to this book on CD while commuting -- which may be one reason it didn't drag for me as much as it did for other readers. The story started promisingly enough. The last third, however, is a mess, as if the author didn't know what kind of book he wanted to write. The attempts at humor became grating; the characters started to bore me. And the resolution was not in the least believable."
5,A feast of meaty fiction,"This book is like a seven-course literary feast for the starving reader. It is my first book by Mr. Gruber, and having finished it about 10 minutes ago, I'll be ordering the rest of his catalog immediately. It absolutely soars on so many levels: a superbly plotted thriller with a deft, energetic plot full of intricate, dark twists; an existential meditation of the roots of personal identity and growing up; a good-natured, deconstructionist poke at fiction and metafiction; a biting, anecdotal familial drama (or two!), á la David Sedaris. It never comes off clumsy or over-reaching and it's written in an effortless, breezy prose that makes it impossible to put down. Like any good meal, you want to slow yourself down just so you can savor every flavor, but in this author's capable hands, resistance is clearly futile. When you're done, you'll just sit back and think to yourself, ""Wow, I won't have anything that good for a long time."" And you'll be right."
1,The Book of Boredom and Dread,"What a waste of money and time! I did finish the book but it was torturous. I dreaded reading it but made myself complete it. Never again will I do that! I found the characters to be unbelievable and irritating. This book put me to sleep many times. My advice to anyone thinking of buying this book is a resounding NO! If you still aren't quite sure, at least go the library, check it out and save your money!"
2,This book is an IQ test of sorts,"If you cannot see the plot ""twists"" coming a mile away, you can safely conclude that you're among the dumbest people on earth. Look, I'm terrible at predicting surprise twists and turns, plot points, etc. But if even I can easily foresee every alleged twist, then what we have here is a fairly crappy book.The prose is, of course, truly wretched. I don't generally expect much from these types of books. Usually, a compelling plot can compensate for pulpy prose. But for a supposed thriller, this book offered no suspense, no tension, and only a passably interesting plot. Not horrendous, but not noteworthy.The pace was fairly lethargic. Some of the background facts upon which the plot is laid are entertaining. As a whole, the book is okay in a time-killer sort of way. But to say that the book did not live up to the blurbs on the cover is an understatement of the highest order."
1,"Yuck, yuck, yuck!","Lots of pages for too many characters. How to track what they know/when they know it? Even in the end the reader is left hanging with not so much as a wrap up. Author assumes we're too smart for that. Well, some of his plot lines don't make sense so it would have been nice to see him try to put the cherry on top.In summary: confusing and wordy....verbose. And the Shakespeare translations became so difficult and irrelevant that I just skipped them. Not the fun ride I thought it would be.This is my only revenge for spending $ on this book....writing my review."
3,Great Plot... saggy underpinnings,"I loved the plot... old manuscripts, secret lives, globe trotting, adventure. I just didn't care for the overuse of the f-bomb, and the many many mentions of sexual contact between the main character and numerous women. It's just disgusting. He should have come down with a disease from all of it.. YUCK. But the underlying story is very good.. and if the auther had laid off these crude underpinnings it would have been an even better book. Plus it would have saves some pages.. and not been so long. I like it.. but didn't love it."
2,Looks like I won't finish it anytime soon,"I found the reviews interesting, but I've been struggling with one page a night ... can't seem to get caught in the plot, the characters are confussing and the old English is giving me a headache. I hate not to finish a book, so I will, but it will be because I am headstrong, nothing else."
2,Disappointing,"I really expected more than this book delivered. The basic concept of the book was excellent. A missing Shakespeare manuscript and coded correspondences from an individual sent to spy on WS. I took a lot of British History and Literature in college and found this an interesting hook.However, the character development and dialogue was poor with plot being very predictable. As another reviewer pointed out, none of the main characters were very likable or interesting. I did finish the book by speed reading through the middle portion of the book but did think about dropping the book half way through and reading something else.Unless, you cannot find anything better to read. I would wait for the movie or a greatly abridged book on tape. If it ever is made into a movie, hopefully a screenwriter can clean up the junk in the story, and there is a lot of junk.I was not a fan of the Da Vinci Code, but this book makes Da vinci look like a Hemingway novel."
2,Loses a star because he is often a good author,"This was a shrug-worthy book. I am a fan of this particular author, having read his superb novels that he ghost wrote. Here, sadly, I think that he was trying to recreate that tangled web of intrigue that surrounded the Karp family delivered with humor and insight. But it was not to be. In my opinion, he drove every character or plot device into the ground and I stopped caring whether the treasure was real, whether the waif bookbinder was a player or a victim, whether the self-loving lawyer would redeem himself, and so on. Every so often there was that Karp magic and the special command of the English language that the author owns. On its own this was probably a three star book, but I give a special demerit for a favored author who made me not care."
3,Nice balance of scholarship and action,"Easy-to-read romp posing the question what would happen if a new work by William Shakespear were to be found. Even though I have never read the DaVinci code, I call this type of novel DaVinci-esque because it involves a ""lost"" book or other literary item, throws together some unlikely characters who get caught up in the search for said lost item, tosses in some bad guys, and leads everyone on an elaborate treasure hunt before finally revealing . . . that the item really isn't quite what it seemed to be. Now that I think about it, maybe I should start calling these ""Maltese Falcon-esque"" novels. Either way, this was a good, quick read with just the right balance of facts (to soothe my ego into believing the book isn't completely rotting my mind) and mysteries (to amuse and keep me guessing). Good enough to lead me to read another book by the same author."
1,COULD NOT FINISH,"i tried twice to finish this book but finally i admitted defeathow dullthe ciphering went right over my head perhaps because i could care lessthe ""olde English"" parts were dull and slow to readin the end i stopped reading as i just didn't care what happened to the charactersno more M Gruber for me, that's for sure"
2,Couldn't stand the reading voice,"This review pertains to the audiobook read by Stephen Hoye.The voice of the gentleman selected to read this novel was so annoying to me, his reading was so eccentric it obliterated the plot for me. I couldn't get past it and just gave up. Producers, publishers and authors should pay a lot more attention to the voice they select to narrate a wonderful book."
2,No Substance All Shadows,"The pain of continually anticipating this book to develop proved too much and at page 194 I put myself out of my misery by firmly shutting it and pronouncing it done. Admittedly, I have engaged thistechnique previously but always with library books or paperbacks bought at the half price store, never with one for which I had paid full price at a boutique bookstore. The pain of losing $14.95 paled with progressing onward amongst a totality of unlikable characters, sentences packed with gratuitous verbiage striving to impress the tortured reader and the absence of any developing plot that draws one in with finesse."
2,Disappointed,"Although I like thrillers, including those with literary themes, I didn't finish this one. I just didn't care enough about most of the characters to warrent further reading. An Olympic weight-lifting lawyer...an ex-con priest...these just didn't work at all for me."
1,Better Than Ambien,"One of the most excruciating reads of my lifetime, Gruber makes me long for the more accomplished voice of... say... a Franklin W. Dixon or Beverly Cleary. His dialogue is certainly reminiscent (conjuring grade school conversations), his structure not quite as complex.I'll tip my hat to an interesting and fairly well-researched premise, however Gruber has executed it with all the skill of a high school junior slamming together a last-night, creative writing project.Taut thriller? I can't remember reading any book that so quickly put me into such a deep slumber. More effective than Ambien, it took me weeks to finish.Buy this book only if you want to question why you still read."
2,Lee Child disappoints,"AFter reading the 3 Jimmy Paz mysteries, I was very disappointed in this book. I couldn't finish it. Maybe it becomes more interesting and less tedious after 1/2 way through but I couldn't trudge any more."
1,Nature at its worst,"OMG I really want to give this minus 5 rating. Sound quality is not bad but what they are recording are so annoying!!! Who needs to hear a cat meowing (the way it wants to eat NOW) and puppy crying. What a torture! It would be a cool sound collection for other purposes (if you can think of any). Definitely try the sound sample before buying it. But for relaxation, I'd recommend some of those echo of nature or summer rain, etc. instead."
5,This is a wonderful book!,"This book on Collectible Television Memorabilia will delight you with it's fascinating topic, photos and descriptions. It covers 900 subjects with 500 photos- all well described,well written and well researched. You'll enjoy turning back the years with page after page of your favorite TV shows trinkets, dolls, games, and much more. Well done!!"
1,disappointing,"I've read all the reviews here and I must say they all baffle me a little. There's simply not enough here to either hate or proclaim as the greatest thing since sliced bread. There's very little current religious thinking and I couldn't find any real science despite going back through it quite carefully. There are numerous valuable books on both sides of this debate, but unfortunately this isn't one of them."
4,Great Introduction into Creationism,This book is a great introduction into the theory of creation. It is a simple read and can easily be completed within a couple of hours but don't let the shortness of it fool you. There is enough information in this book to raise the eyebrows of the most sceptical people. It explains the importance of seperating the proven fact of microevolution from the unproven theory of macroevolution.
1,Same old weak arguments,"You have to wonder at the fact that most ""books"" that argue againest evolution are usually under 100 pages in length. You would think if evolution was completely bunk that creationist or intelligent design believers would have more to say.Anyways this book is more of the same literary slight of hand that is in the authors other book ""Tornado in s Junkyard"" in which he uses dishonest manipulation of facts and a gross misunderstanding of statistics and evolutionary theory to disillusion the simple minded reader. Whether he does this intentionally or if he to is delusional we dont know but either way this book and the authors other works can not be taken seriously."
5,Faith vs. Faith,"One of the individuals here who reviewed this book wrote, ""This is the type of book that should be BURNED. And the author as well."" That almost says it all. The evolution vs. anti-evolution debate is not about science, but religion, the most excessive, unreasoning ""religiosity"" in this case (atheism, in its own way, being a religion) having to do with certain people's (in the academic community these days especially) intellectual commitment to evolution, in spite of the overwhelming evidence that it never happened and never even could have happened, as can be demonstrated from the discoveries of science itself. A person does not have to be a ""Christian"" to realize that evolution is an incorrect explanation of things, but he is somewhat less than an honest or otherwise fully informed person, as opposed to a victim himself of religious zealotry, if he does not."
1,Fails at its Proclaimed Objective,"Because its proclaimed objective is an impossibility.All Perloff does is reiterate the same tired nonsensical ""evidence against"" the very real process of natural selection. Perloff's ""arguments"" have been repeatedly and summarily dismissed by the scientific community as either ignorance or willful misrepresentation of fact.The notion that Science avoids the claims of so-called critics of evolutionary theory is both ironic and laughable given the fingers in the ears approach that ""creationism"" generally takes to the subject.To call this book ""logical"" is to dilute the meaning of logic to the level of the superstitious pap that goes by the name of ""intelligent-design""."
2,Interesting Short Biography Devalued by Sloppy Editing,"Emund Morris' short biography about Beethoven is perfect for anybody who does not need to know the most trivial minutiae of Beethoven's life. Everything that is important is contained in this book. Major compositions of Beethoven are briefly described and give suggestions what titles one should add to the personal Beethoven collection.Without doubt, though, the writing of this Pulitzer Prize winning author is at times pompous and marred by very slopping editing. There are many instances of typos, poor grammar and misspelled German words.Bernd Neuenkirchen"
2,Weak and disappointing,"The author spends much too little time on what made Beethoven great as a composer, how he differed from the composers who came before, and how structurally he created his masterpieces. In addition, the anecdotes at the beginning and end of the book, which I guess are supposed to give perspective on Beethoven's lasting greatness, are a tepid waste of time."
1,An unfortunate book on Beethoven,"I was received this book as a present, shortly after reviewing the more objective biography of Beethoven by Barry Cooper, part of the Masters Musicians series publihed by Oxford University Press, a second time. It did not take me long before before I realized that Morris relied too much on the writings of the Sterbas, and accepted without questioning some of the more contraversial aspects in the writings of Maynard Solomon. Many of these aspects were adressed in the Barry Cooper's biography, in which he has investigated and put into proper perspective. I became more and irritated as I read through Morris's book. It is a shame that this book is written with the idea of for introducing Beethoven to the general public. For a more acurate biography of Beethoven incorporating his life and works, one without the other is meaningless, I would suggest the Biography by Barry Cooper."
4,Concise and very well-written,A good starting point for research into the life of Beethoven. Not overly technical and an excellent version for the music lover who wants to understand the person without the need for fluency in musical theory.
4,"Short , Powerful and Elegant","Edmund Morris wrote "" Dutch"" the single best biography of President Reagan . This short life of Beethoven is powerful . Morris misses none of his subjects complexity or overwhelming brilliance all the while keeping the person clear in his sight . Strongly recommended."
4,Ends the pretense of objectivity,"Since our modern time is a time of salespeople, our biographies try to convince us how ""objective"" they are. But nothing about music is objective; after all, to an idiot the best symphony is just frilly noise.Morris takes a simple, straightforward and yet contemporary take on Beethoven, exploring in parallel his life and his music. While this could easily get really bad in a critical theory sense, such as ""his mother beat him with a drumstick, so he wrote drums last,"" instead it gives us a sensation of being an observer, or a friend of a friend, during Beethoven's life.The resulting lack of pretense makes for a simple, complete, and honest assessment of this composer, all while avoiding any diminution of the power of his works. I'd recommend this as a first biography of Beethoven."
2,it looks amazing and my boyfriend loves it BUT,he's only been wearing it for a week and the silver is beginning to tarnish. Perhaps a good cleaning will restore the shine but I'm disappointed that it needs it so soon after he began wearing it.
3,Seems like Lots of Borrowing,"There are probably six to nine originally written pages in this book. It's not a short book but just full of quotes from Shakespeare's plays. Supposedly they are arranged by the topics--each with one of the above new pages leading the topic. Even those pages seemed to be borrowed in part from the ""The Art of Seduction"" by Robert Greene. Without a doubt, this is the world's greatest book on the subject."
3,Buck 325,"I bought this knife to replace the same model Buck knife I had lost on a trip. I am a bit disappointed with the overall quality of this knife. The knife that I had previously owned was gotten many years ago. It was slightly heavier and seemingly of higher quality. Additionally, it was made in the USA. This knife while identical in appearance, was made in China and simply does not seem to be of the same quality - even the weight of the knife, is lighter. It also has a much sloppier action when deploying the blade.Buck knives have always been a favorite of mine due to their quality, substance and design. This knife is an ideal 'gentleman's knife' though I would give an arm and a leg to have the knife I had lost in place of this one - or at least a knife of the same 'original' quality."
2,Not the Buck brand knife I'm used to..,"First of all I normally give 4 or 5 star ratings on my amazon purchases. With that said, I can only give this buck knife a two star and thats pushing it. I knew it was made in China before I bought it, but I believed that a company as solid as Buck wouldn't sell a less than excellent product. I was wrong. The first thing I noticed is it doesn't open smoothly and it also doesn't close easily at all. I will say the blade is very sharp, but other than that I have nothing good to say about it.Trust me, you can find much better in this price range for a small lock blade folder."
3,It's very nice but.....,"Yes, I really like this little beauty. The blade is razor sharp, the fit and finishis top notch by my standards, and the blade shape and size ideal for me.But how is one supposed to open this thing? I see a lot of knives like this around,but no explanation of how one is supposed to use them.After a little experimentation, I found exactly one method that worked. I have to hold the knife in my right hand, blade side in, and push up and out on the stud with my thumb. It works well, but you have to hold it exactly right and try as I might, I couldn't seem to open it left handed. It's a pain to get it oriented exactly right every time I pull it out of my pocket.Closing the knife is not exactly easy either. The lock mechanism is simple and works extremely well, but closing is a two handed operation and rather awkward.I would love to give this gem a great rating, but it's just not right for me. Perhaps in time I'll get used to it."
5,Wolfman Mississippi River Blues @ Snug Harbor,"This guy is like John Lennon in the sense that he's that good, and nobody knows it...ain't that a pity? So much competition. They got linebackers at LSU that can sing the blues, and Walter has a PHD in local competition. Because, Austin, Texas is nothing compared to NO as a music village...and Walter, man, he's a fine bluesman..."
4,Nice photo book,"This is a nice collection of nude Thai woman, looks like 1980's style, soft lights, skinny girls. The book is a large format but pretty thin, I was expecting more content. My copy was printed in German, but I'm told there are English copies out there."
3,Get Used To It,"This one is a weird CD, Its sounds like a cannibal corpse thats slower and not gore obsessed. I had a 20 dollar gift certificate from christmas to fred meyer. They didnt have any of my favorite death metal bands so i was checking this out. i didnt buy it cuz of what i heard. but i listened to it at home a bit and it is really a good album. I admit i didnt like it a bit at first but just gotta give it some time."
1,Ew and Ew Again,"Okay, I heard Amerika the Brutal on Music Choice and I was like ""hey! cool song!"" So I went and bought this CD and was crushed. First off, why the hell is there no PA in this? Every other word is f***. They sing songs about killing christians, the album art feautres naked women being tortured and other disturbing images, and the music simply sucks.A MUST HAVE for deathmetal and blackmetal fans. But not for other rock lovers."
1,"This album belongs ""six feet under""...","And I liked ""Haunted"". Sounds like this band has ""evolved"" and ""taken a new direction"". I mean, it was always over-the-top psychosis, but in a good way. Now it's rediculous. How do you go from writing murder glorification songs like ""Feasting on the Blood of the Insane"" and ""Torture Killer"" to whining about American ""brutality"" against the regime of real-life ""Torture Killer"" Saddam Hussein? Now THAT'S real psychosis! Unless... they're joining the liberal f@g pacifists because they LIKED Saddam's mass-murdering, serial-raping family! I guess that would make sense. What's next? A song about banning guns? Or maybe paying reparations for slavery? Can't hardly wait."
1,live show,"sfu is absolutely terrible. i saw em play in va beach last night and it was sooooooo lame. first off, they have the most god awful stage presence i've ever seen, these guys seriously couldn't get the crowd going above a few kids jumpin around and they were HEADLINING.Second of all,have you ever listened to the lyrics? what fcking dorks, who could take lyrics like,"" the world makes me sick, tell me what to do, i have a special place for you"" seriously or even think thats cool,or the part in that song apocalypse(which i may add is great comedy) where he says,""i want to eat your brain!"" This blows completely,oh, and the singer's voice SUCKS. haha,but if you like this,check out millencolin, they rock just as hard."
2,WHAT IS THIS CRAP???,"THE BEST SFU ALBUMS ARE ""THE HAUNTED"" AND MAXIMUM VIOLENCE"" DO I NEED TO SAY MORE???? WELL, THIS ALBUM IS CRAP."
1,Are you sirious ?,"Chris barnes used to be good when he was with cannibal corpse but his vocals changed once he formed the terrible six feet under... While on cc he sounde demonic, disturbing, sicko like as in sfu he sounds tired & lame and his vocals coulnd even scare a little baby--infact, it wouln't scary any one but only bored them to death and its pretty damn funny and lame! I was dissapointing to actullie see how awfull Chris barnes turn once he left cc i mean i thought atleast he would get with a gore or disturbing or dark type of band but nope he got wid the crap we kno as six feet under! This is not deathmetal by a long shot...Sounds alot like nu-metal! Linkin park has more metal in them then six feet under and likin park has basically no metal--so what does that tel; you about sfu ? Since they begun all of their albums are awful and no not even their debut is any good! Do yo self a favor and skip this one!"
1,Boring,"As a fan of good old school death metal as well as some of the new deathmetal bands with actullie good and original music i find Sfu to be one of the worse bands i've ever heard and trust me i have listing to all of their albums since their debut and not one of those cds impressed not even one song did any justice for me so there fore i say Chris barnes should retired and stop hurting his vocals and stop growling like a retard and leave the deathmetal to people who can actullie play it well... All the songs in this cd are awfull but if you want me to name some i willll exemple "" amerika the brutal"" "" my hatred"" , "" when the skin turns blue"" i laugh when i listing to sfu because frankly ? Its a joke and thats how sfu should be taken as a joke nothing else... If you consider your self a true deathmetal fan and listings to sfu then my friend your not sorry to inform you! Laters !"
4,"Not bad, but definetly a step down ...","Having loved Maximum Violence and True Carnage, expected a tad more from this release. While it does have it's moments (Skin Turns Blue, Murdered in the Basement and Escape from the Grave), it doesn't seem to grab the listener like previous SFU releases have. While it's great that Barnes has opinions on the war and politics in general, if I want news, I'll watch CNN - when I buy an SFU disc I want pure mass murder carnage!! Amerika the Brutal is a good tune from a music standpoint, but the lyrical content just doesn't do it for me. As for the tunes themselves, Swanson shows great guitar work here as usual, but I don't think it's up to the standards he's shown in the past.Overall, a good release from a great band. I would have rated it 3 stars were it just on the music itself, but the DVD extras and the top notch packaging and artwork knocked it up a peg. I think if you like SFU you'll like this release as well, but not the best thing we have seen from the guys."
3,not bad,"Typical 6FTU, first 4 songs are amazing and then the rest are all filler. After hearing ""amerika the Brutal"" I was really hyped for this album but it just falls off after the first few I'd give it a 2 star but the DVD is certainly a nice touch."
1,What the hell is this???,"I have to say that it wasn't bed enaugh Chris barnes used to be a part of the worse deathmetal (cannibal corpse) and now he is in a much worse band which is ? Six feet under. I had a chance from a friend to listing to six feet under's ""bringer of blood (w/dvd)(dig)"" and my thoughts were that it sucks more then a vaccum... I mean, the whole album is a complete joke! Chris barnes rapping? This is suppost be deathmetal not linking park!Anyways, any band that chooses to name a song spelling america with amerika ? Does not deserv to be in the deathmetal category maiby in nu-metal or rapmetal but not deathmetal. Dont waste your one on this washed up/has been garbage. Not recommend. This isn even deathmetal."
2,Politics and music just doesn't mix well in my veins.,"Amerika The Brutal was a failure to bash.And Chris Barnes - please take those socks out of your mouth and growl for me, is that too much to ask?I will say, however, that it is better than the death-rap of 'One Bullet Left.'I'd recommend this album to rookies of the death metal genre, but I'm very disappointed in knowing that Barnes is putting out."
2,not close to the standard chris helped set,music isnt near as good as what 6FU usually pumps out lyrics are boring (whats happening chris) but Amerika the Brutal makes it worth it (even if it is repetitive)
3,It could be worse......I think.,"If your an SFU fan you'll find tracks on this that are worth listening to. At that same time there is some real sh*t thrown in the mix too. (Amerika the Brutal) It's hard not to lose at some respect for this band after producing a politically opinionated war song. Barnes mixes things up vocally to add another dimension to the music, I'm just not sure that it was really worth it. Another album as weak as this means I can stop wasting money on these guys."
2,garbage...,what can i say? six feet under will never be anything more then mediocre. they do get an award for writing the gayest song in metal...amerika the brutal. what is this trash? sounds like chris barnes was trying to sound like zach de la rocha only with a growl and a pathetic attempt at singing...utter garbage. there might be 2 or 3 alright songs but this cd does nothing more than drone on...very dissapointing. maximum violence is as good as it will get. its sad to see the linkin park fans enjoying amerika the brutal as their first step into metal....you have along way to go...your definately headed in the wrong direction.
4,My favorite of all there albums,"This CD has the best sounding production of all of there CDs. It's loud and clear, you can easily make out the lyrics. The first 6 tracks are very catchy and stay in your mind. 13 is my 2nd fav followed closely by Maximum violence."
1,"horrible, just about as lame as metallica","Why do i even bother listening to this garbage? These guys get worse with every album, and dj dreadlock (chris barnes) should be put up against a wall and shot for trying to mix inferior nu-metal with death metal, come on know, what the f&*k were you thinking?, as if true carnage wasn't bad enough. In short if you want true death metal do not listen to this s$#t, try Drawn and Quartered, Aborted, Decapitated, Dying Fetus, Vile, Sepsism, Morbid Angel, Monstrosity, Suffocation, Vitl Remains, Death, Obituary, Vehemence, or Cryptopsy.. to name a few."
2,Disappointment after much anticipation..,"I am the happy owner of 7 SFU cd's. With much anticipation, and subsequent multiple listens, I must say this is a disapointment. I read one review stating that the vocals are mixed way up front to a fault. You are correct. Warpath gets my pick. It appeared SFU was on the brink to breakout, but this is not the way to do it."
4,An academic study of themes of queenship.,"John Carmi Parsons, the editor, has brought together 11 essays, of varying quality, dealing with a number of European queens and aspects of queenship spanning the period from the 6th to the 16th centuries. As Parsons explains it, ""[t]he contributors, all historians, offer no biographical sketches of individual queens, but have instead sought to dissect ways in which queens pursued and expoited means to power, and how their actions were interpreted by others."" As such, the book will probably be of more interest to academics than to the general reader with an interest in medieval history."
4,are u lonely?,"i was caught by the feelings trapped in 'on the verge of breaking completely down' from their website. i thought, ""i HAVE to get their CD"". it's nothing great or phenomenal, but if u looking for sth sentimental with lots of acoustic guitar, u might like this."
2,This isn't the CD you're looking for,"If you're here, you're probably looking forThe Archies: 20 Greatest Hitsinstead. It's really got 20 songs, and its cover looks like the cover here, except not distorted."
5,just want I've been looking for!!,"the Pocketec drives are awesome! They are so simple to use...literally plug and play. Plus, the massive storage capacity gives me more than enough memory to conveniently take everything with me while I am on the road without taking up room in my briefcase."
2,Poor quality video,"Excellent documentary of comatose patients. Used it in my classroom, in conjuction with the Nervous system section. The video is very poor quality from about half way through until the end. It freezes, the words and the mouth movements are not together, and there are ""hot spots"" on the video."
3,Not Bad,"I bought this album from Amazon because I heard it was an Elephant 6 Project. Then I read more about it and they said it was like Gypsy-Oompa music so I had to try it out.When I got it, I didn't listen to it for a few days. When I finally listened to it I realized it wasn't as great as I expected it to be, but still not bad at all.I give it 3 stars because it's very different but yet not too different. Meaning it was as groundbreaking as I thought it would be."
5,i've got a good idea,"hey bonnie i think this is a great series but i think it would be realy cool if you made a tv series brought kate and christine back and maybe let mrs. reg come back for visits. o.k i think this is is a realy good idea so if you do make a series its that easy. thank you! your reader, alex S."
5,Insightful and inspiring,"This book is a wonderful introduction to the life, spirituality, and mission of the monks of Holy Mount Athos. The historical notes, detailing of the daily life of the monks, and description of the impact their spirituality has had on the world via St. Herman of Alaska were particularly moving and helpful aspects of the book. Perhaps the greatest aspect of this book, however, is the inspiration it provides for those of us who are trying to live a life of authentic Orthodox spirituality in the world and not on Mount Athos. The monks, in the sermons and other short writings and sayings excerpted in this book, have constant reference to the attainability of God's grace even for those in the world and offer us encouragement and advice on how to attain to it. I recommend this book both for those who want to better under the place of the Holy Mountain in Orthodoxy and for those who want to deepen their own spiritual life."
1,Not Good,I hated the ending. The book itself wasn't all bad. It was just mostly bad. I love vampire fiction and this fell way way short.
1,I'm Definitely Not Thirsty for More M. T. Anderson Novels After This Effort!,"Previously I read this author's book Burger Wuss and wasn't too impressed. Thirsty however from the blurb on the back cover looked like it would be a good interesting book. However reality is just like the way a vampire gets blood from a victim's neck, it sucked! Not even an ounce of believability this story starts off with Chris the main character attending a vampire execution in the town square with his brother. Where not talking a couple of centuries ago but set in 21st century Massachusetts. The author really needed to make up his mind which period to set this book in. The reader obviously has to assume vampires exist for this novel but we all know vampire executions don't happen in the USA today. Novels are not enjoyable if you can't believe what you are reading could be happening."
3,thirsty for lies,"This book is good but it has many lies. First,people just dont TURN into vampires, they have to be blooded. Second, they CAN tell who other vampires are in a crowd, but not by their shadows, they have an aura (a scent a vampire gives off).This book was very missleading. If you want a book that is true, I would strongly recommend a different book. If you are looking for a fairy tale, this would be your book."
4,It's not that bad.,"As far as the rest of the reviews I've read, (or at least most of them), everyone doesn't like the book. One of the main reasons mentioned was because the ending dooms the main character. I would like to point out, that in life, not all endings are happy. I personally loved the ending, the way that the ending wasn't what you thought it was. It was a surprise ending for once, and I feel that it's a very Stephen King-esque end.Not everyone lives happily ever after.I'd give this a very low four, or a high three."
1,waste of time,"Well, this book was two days of my life I will not get back. I pushed through just because I don't like to leave a book unfinished. Sadly, this book had so much potential. There were many openings where the writer could have really taken the story somewhere good. The writing itself was tiresome. It read pretty much like this ""the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"". The ending was absolutely horrible. It resolved nothing for the main character. Save your money on this one. If you truly want to read it, I suggest getting it from the library."
3,Disappointing!!!,"I'm pretty disappointed... The novel is an incomplete story, if you ask me. Everything was very good, though the author lacked in his theme and plot. To tell the truth, the novel was total incomplete. I think the author rushed carelessly through the novel. If he chose to write a chronicle--where is it? Did he completely rush through the book because he got tired of writing and wanted some money from the incomplete novel, and think the readers won't notice? Well, I notice alright, and I'm disappointed and upset. I won't recommend this. I would expect more from this novel. I read through it day by day, hoping that the novel would turn around and get better. I was wrong, the ending ended like that's the end the whole world will die. Whatever... I dislike this book."
3,Thirsty,"I liked the main character, and the way it made you think about him. I didn't like the fact that the book was short and didn't end as well as I would have liked. I guess I am used to longer books that went into more detail about the character. I liked the part about the party the best. I think the book would be really good for someone around 10 to 16 years old. Then I might rate the book better."
3,Thirsty review,"Chris is an avarage boy going through a change that is not very avarage. He realized that he is starting to get very hungry but not for food. Chris is going on an adventure that he will never forget.I realy like this book because it is very easy to understand and follow.I recomend this book because there is mystery, horror and excitement."
4,Enjoyable read,"I read this book today and I am glad that I took a chance on it. I bought the book at a used bookstore a few months ago and the book sat in my car. Today I ate it up. The author does a great job of telling the story from a teen-ages boy's point of view. Christopher realizes that something is going on--his friends are irritating him, he's in a serious case of like, and there is more.What's particularly great about this book is that vampires really exist. And, when they're caught they are usually lynched (in doors). This lynching, of course, includes the wood stake through the heart in order to properly kill said vamp. My only complaint--it doesn't look like there are any more books in this series.The audience for this book--maybe grade 6 and up. I think adults will enjoy it as well."
4,"Kara W, Miller Place, NY","The book ""Thirsty"" was an excellent and spectacular book. It was greatly detailed and I could see everything that went on right in my own mind. As you read from the beginning to the middle of the book, you will become very confused. The author leaves out a lot of information of what's going on but he does tell you fifth-teen or more pages later. I greatly encourage you to read this book if you love vampires and fiction books. The one thing I didn't like about this book was the ending, as if you could call it an ending. He doesn't say what's going to happen to Chris at the end and just ends it like that. I would have given it five stars but because of the ending I gave it four stars."
2,Started with 5 stars and then I dropped,"Just like this book. I was really excited, thinking this was going to be an awesome book. uhm no. I put up withthe bland characters, silly teen talk to like, end up like totally not liking this book and thinking the author just me a completus peckerhead. or something like that. I'm thinking maybe because I'm like 40-ish this book isn't for me. I love y/a just not this p.o.t. I hate the ending, if you can call it that."
2,UGH,"I think this book was at most: okay?? maybe. Listen this book is too long winded to begin with because it's mostly him being whiny and doing really dumb stuff or wonder if he should have done something different. Also his character didn't really developed... even though he was turning into a vampire. So not only did he not gain anything but I as the reader didn't either. I actually lost something, my time."
3,Men's Silver Cuff Bracelet,"I purchased this bracelet for my husband, and he loved it. Unfortunately, it wasn't very sturdy and was easily dented and bent. He did wear it all the time, however. It looked great on him, and he is hoping to receive another."
2,Typical Lonestar,"It's not that this is a ""bad"" project by itself. It is actually better than their last 2 projects. I just find that ""Lonely Grill"" is the standard Lonestar has to hold themselves up to, and once again it was not met. There are of course the romantic ballads, but nothing as well done as ""Amazed"". It strikes me as strange that the first 2 singles off this CD were originally songs done by Emerson Drive (on their ""What If"" CD). In my opinion, Lonestar does not measure up on these songs. They just kind of drag in comparison to the fire and passion Emerson Drive put into it. But I suppose if you haven't heard the previoius versions these songs would be capable of standing on their own, since they both are good songs in their own right. I wish Lonestar better luck on their next CD."
2,Too bad you can't leaf through the pages before you buy.,"This book claims in its introduction, to be superior to other baby names because of its accuracy but clearly it it poorly edited, with names with no meanings and meanings with no names. The bulk of the book does not define if names are masculine, feminine or unisex, and in the one section that does, there are clearly feminine meanings in the male name section. In addition, the title of the book led me to be believe that it would be ALL African names but instead, there are entire pages with no African names, but rather Eurocentric names that some African Americans have used for their children in the past. Worst of all is that some of the ""African names"" are not names at all. Who would name their child ""Ugly woman"", ""evil"" or after a particular ""market place"". My husband and I thought there were some nice choices for girls names, but you really have to read carefully."
2,Title is misleading.,"I consider myself an avid Civil War history reader and James Longstreet admirer. I was anticipating reading more on how General Longstreet's reputation became tarnished and 'trashed' by Jubal Early and his compatriots in an effort to place blame on Dutch Longstreet for the loss at Gettysburg, and elevating Lee to 'Saint"" status after the war. In my opinion, Gen. Longstreet was Lee's most capable and dependable Corps commander - Lee's ""Old War Horse.""This book is about the 'Lost Cause' myth and how it came about, and only mentions James Longstreet in a 'few' lines. The book is very interesting and factual, but I believe the title is misleading.Buy it to read about the Lost Cause origins, but not to read about James Longstreet.PS: If you are in North Georgia, a visit to his grave site in Alta Vista Cemetery,Gainesville, GA, is well worth it. Don't forget to leave a cigar for Ole Dutch!"
4,I'll tell you what you want what you really really want..,"To see pictures of Geri topless or with very little clothing on.. At least that is why my ex bought this video! This video is about Geri and her ""glamour/fashion"" modeling before her career as a Spice Girl. There are interviews on the video with people Geri previously worked with and many positive things are said about her. The cover makes it look like a really trashy video, but it isn't that bad. I would have enjoyed it more if the cover hadn't made the video out to look so distasteful, but that is what sells.I recently gave the tape to a friend of mine who loves the Spice Girls but her boyfriend cannot stand them! This video they actually watched together! ;)If you are a *gigantic* Spice Girls - Ginger fan, you will want this for your collection, however it is *NOT* for young viewers with the semi-nude content. No other Spice Girls are featured in this video."
1,This video was extremely disrespectful towards Geri.,I've only started to watch this video until I figured out what it was about. I think it is extremely disrespectful of people to go and publish nude photos of Geri's past. I don't think anyone has the right to do so unless it is under Geri's consent.
1,KEEP THEM COVERED! OLD SPICES GO BAD AND THEY ALREADY ARE!,"I can't stand the Spice Girls. They are not musicians in any sense of the word. Like the stupid song, ""Wannabe"" (zig a zig ha is stupid gibberish), they are musical and acting wannabes. All they are is a put together ensemble that miraculously passed an audition. How? Good question. Nasty Spice, Rancid Spice, Rotten Spice, Stinky Spice and Stupid Spice belong in the cupboard. Old Spices do go bad and these girls were bad from the get go. They stink."
1,PITIFUL & PATHETIC,"I hate the Spice Girls. They can't act, dance, sing or read lines well. They are just a put together female ensemble of ""Wannabes."" They're really bad. They couldn't sing their way out of a Chevrolet. They stink. Nasty Spice, Rancid Spice, Rotten Spice, Stinky Spice and Stupid Spice belong down the drain! That's the place for spices that aren't good and Nasty, et al. are NOT good.Former Beatle George Harrison said it best. The Spice Girls sound best with the sound down so you can't hear them. THEY STINK!"
4,Love the colors...,"Purchased for my nephew so I haven't actually slept on it LOL. It seems very much like a standard toddler bedding set. What I mean is that it isn't the plushest, but it does feel nice and I suspect that it will be soft and cozy after the first initial wash. The dinosaurs are great as are the colors. It is nice to see something different then the usual Diego, Cars etc etc.! It comes with the pilllow case, comforter, fitted sheet and flat sheet. The best part is that Amazon also offers matching shams and pillows if you search diligently enough for them. I feel that it is worth it and better than the average 39.99 set out there; alone in design and feel..."
3,Decorative but not durable,"I purchased this mostly because it was a style I could purchase both for Toddler bed size and twin sized since my sons have their beds in the same room. Initially I was very pleased. The colors are excellent, the twin and toddler matched very well and although it isn't as heavy as I would like (being in the North east it gets Very cold in winter) I wasn't expecting it to be super thick. However after several washes, the elastic has worn out on the fitted sheets on both the toddler and twin versions. I don't know about your kids but my sons are super active and I usually have to remake the bed at least once a night. Not very convenient. Hence the lukewarm review."
5,"Quite Literally, I Laughed, I Cried","This is hard play to describe. I'd call it something like a funny, heart-warming thriller. ""Communicating Doors"" is the story of a prostitute named Phoebe who is given the chance to save her own life and the lives of two other women when, fleeing a murderer through a communicating door, she finds herself unexpectedly twenty years in the past. This play made me feel a full range of emotions in three hours when I saw it in the theater, and reading it was almost as good. Ruella and Phoebe, the two main characters, are two of the most likable and complex people I've encountered recently in literature. It kept me laughing, and in suspense, right up through the final scene. I rarely give out five stars, but this play deserves it."
2,Not as expected - I would chose the less expensive option,"I purchased the Hammered Steel for $25.99 on recommendation of the Martha Stewart Living magazine. At the time, I had a choice between this set and a set for hanging plants for about $8.99. I should have chosen the much less expensive set of hooks for hanging pots as those hooks came with rubber tips (Enclume hooks do not) and were probably the same or similar quality. I do not recommend spending the money on these unless you have to have the specialty finish like Copper."
1,Baloney,"I bought this book with high hopes. I found, to my disappointment, that it is baloney. Poorly written -reminscent of travel literature in which every noun is preceded by at least one adjective - and incompetent. If anything the author claims is true, he has not demonstrated it. It is just a meaningless polemic."
1,NOT sterling silver! Buyer BEWARE!,"Although this is a gorgeous piece, the cross is in fact NOT sterling silver. When I first picked it up, I could tell it had a lighter 'feel' to it than all of my other sterling silver pieces. (and believe me, I've been buying sterling silver for years)The marking on the cross indicates .928, and there is in fact NO such grading for sterling silver.I even put a magnet next to this piece - it immediately stuck to it just as regular metal would.I then took this to a jeweler who told me it was sterling silver PLATED, and NOT sterling silver.One more thing - upon first opening the clasp, the lobster claw hinge fell completely apart.It was very disappointing that what COULD have been a gorgeous piece of jewelry was in fact just silver-plated metal."
2,ok for the price.,"Although there are many videos on YouTube this product came with no instructions or more importantly a replacement rivet or screw. IMO these should be included, the bulk of these are being installed by mediocre mechanics at best.My beef is that its a poor design from GM and should be recalled. My truck is a low mileage (44K) and has been babied its entire life. A door handle should not fail in 44,000 miles."
3,Functional but not correct color,"The last time the handle broke it was a $75 item at the dealership, so bang for your buck this is amazing! My only beef is that no color information or selection option is given for this part and it comes in gray. I needed tan. Easy fix though if it the pewter handle that's broke. Pull the new one out and install in the old housing. Easy pleasy and color cooridinated."
5,Perfect replacement,"This handle is a perfect replacement for the original. The only drawback is that is was made in a foriegn country. We hope it lasts as long as the original, so far (one month) it has very well."
4,Quickly right,The door handle was delivered within a week and was the proper side. It installed perfectlyJ with help from a Youtube video for hints. Would have been nice if they sent the screw/washer/nut that you need to replace the drilled out rivit. Found I already had it.
5,OEM Quality,"great quality replacement part and matches perfectly. I've always had good luck with dorman replacement parts. Installed over a month ago, still working well."
3,Fits OK but not up to OEM,"I bought the standard grey one because my truck is 15 years old and I wanted the least expensive part. The handle assembly fit perfectly, but the paint(?) on the handle chipped off around the edge almost immediately. If this was for a new truck I'd be disappointed but it does the job so I'm OK with the less than desirable finish."
4,Good Product.,This is an after market product which worked perfectly on my vehicle. Last time I bought original equipment for more than 3 times the price....Awesome!
5,exact fit,easy to install and better quality than the original one that broke. exact color so it matches the other handle on my truck
4,Dprman review,"It's OEM and I guess that's the problem. After so long the plastic breaks, and I expect this to break again years down the road. It also takes a huge rivet which most people don't have. I had to purchase a bag just for this so I used one in the whole bag and don't know if I ever use the rest. (To be fair it did say you can use a certain size screw if you don't have the rivet.)I guess in the end, I'm not happy with the overall quality of my truck."
2,Dorman 77187 Chevrolet/GMC Driver Side Replacement Interior Door Handle,"this was an alright product, but there was a couple of issues, first was the picture online did not match the real thing, also the lock plug for the door lock does not work, had to use the old one and cut the tab down for the old one to fit."
2,Product failed about a month after purchase,"Initially, I paid about $2.39 for this product and for the passenger side handle. It arrived quickly and was easy to install. I could not notice any major differences between this product and the original product. Even after installing on the passenger side, the door is difficult to open. It worked fine on the driver's side door until today, when I noticed difficulty opening the door. Eventually, the lever snapped off the handle. I am not thrilled to have to keep opening my door from the outside when exiting the vehicle. Now, my interior handle needs to be replaced for the second time in one and a half months."
5,WakeUp Night - a classic favorite,Illustrations are realistic. Lift a flaps on each page reveal the nocturnal animal awaiting night to come. At the end all the animals are awake looking at the child as he is going to bed. Glow in thedark is not needed. The book itself is the great thing. Great night time book.
2,Format doesn't make sense...,"OK so it is a cute story. BUT....* The glow in the dark format is ridiculous because in order for the moon to glow on each page, you would have to expose each page to the light one at a time. Before bedtime.* Even if you DO expose each page to the light so the moon will glow in the dark, you can't READ the book in the dark because you can't read the words! or see the dark-colored animals! The glow won't be seen because you need a light to see the words.* Just what IS that glow stuff anyway? Because it has a texture, my toddler scratches it and it worries me that she gets that stuff under her fingernails...is it toxic?I would not buy this book again. There are just so many good books out there that this is just not worth the $."
5,very understandable,This book is written to be very understandable. It takes you through everything slowly building up to more difficult concepts.
5,I wish you love,"My parents loved Gloria Lynne, and I grew up hearing her around the house. I love the CD. The quality is good, and the songs are all I could hope for."
4,love the color,"I like this bell a lot. It matches my orange bike, which is fun. The bell sound itself is a little annoying, but it's loud enough for people to hear me and that's what I needed."
2,Yawn...,"this white boy blues stuff is so over-done. every band like this from this era all sound the same: boring, watered-down, stuck-in-the-same-groove, white-boy, schlock. pure torture!! sure, the PBBB, John Mayall, Clapton, etc, all did their part by bringing the underlying music (real blues) to the attention of a larger audience, which is not necessarily a good thing, but i can respect that they liked what they heard and copied it. fair enough. however, if you're looking for something that can be felt through your speakers and over time and space, check out Magic Sam, Howlin Wolf, Muddy Waters, Willie Dixon, or Lonnie Mack, or, if you like the older stuff, Son House, or RL Burnside. this 3rd generation blues stuff is soooo boring and predictable at this point."
5,"One of the first, definitely the BEST!","Impossible to convey how good & truely unique this album is, orhow passionate I am about it. I first heard this album 35 years ago,(yeah, I'm a fogey), & I've been listening to the blues eversince, but I've never heard a collection that even comes close to thisone! Even the band itself could never duplicate the magic this onehad. An earlier review said Butterfield was 23 when this wasrecorded, but in fact, he was only 22. Anybody who says no white boycan play/sing the blues has never heard this record. The chemistry ofthis band, on this record, is pure magic. Anybody who's even slightlyinto blues, & anybody who's at all curious, should run out, (orclick above), as fast as possible... I could go on, but I guess I'vepretty much said it all. If anyone's interested in discussing thisrecord, contact me at Bucksnort1@home.com I could talk about it forhours. Enjoy!"
5,Best White Harpist Ever,Pure History. This album opened the collective white consciousness to the stark depths of the blues. Not to be missed.
4,"Don't believe the ""East/West"" hype--get this one instead.","The general critical consensus seems to be that the PBBB's second album, ""East/West,"" is the one to get, but I disagree. I own both, and I find that this, the band's first release, is much better than album #2. The songs here are played with more intensity and focus (the band is ""tighter,"" as musicians say), and the vocals and harp are tough, gritty and ""authentic,"" in a blues sense. In contrast, the band seems to be trying too hard to sound like great blues on ""East/West."" On this album, everything feels organic and unforced. Mike Bloomfield, of course, is excellent on every track, and that makes a significant difference between this and any other ""white boy blues,"" or whatever you want to call it, that was around at the same time. Here, and on Dylan albums, he's really the difference between ""good"" and ""great."" Get this one--it sounds fresh, almost contemporary, despite its age."
4,An unexpected toy and treat!,"I found this in a little cat themed gift shop last week. It was interesting for the cats to try. Once we saw that the cats liked it, I immediately looked to see if Amazon had it available.They both drank a little of the tea. For us watching, it was fun to see them sniff the air and get energized not understanding where the smell was coming from as it was steeping.We dried out the tea bag and gave it to them as the suggested toy. It wasn't as big of a hit as some other catnip pouches, such as those from Grampa's Garden. However, with the long string, it made a much better interactive toy. The photo in the link above is fairly accurate. The bags are huge compared to normal tea bags!Not sure why Amazon is selling them in a two pack when the boxes come with three, but at least it says they are available:Pet Buddies PB1003CS Cat Nip Tea 2 pack Poly Bag"
2,Interesting dvd box,When I received this product the dvd case was cracked and for some reason the writing was in Spanish... very interesting
5,We all love it,The family has a great time with this movie. The soundtrack is a lot of fun and so are the characters. It has great rewatchability!
3,the hit squad,"John Locke's novel, Now and Then, is superbly developed with a strong storyline. The novel presents diverse elements of mystery, revenge, and historical background. The author has cleverly began the novel as a modern thrilling tale. However, he weaves within a depiction of a rare gift passed from generation to generation."
5,NOW AND THEN IN A NOW KINDA WAY!,"NOW AND THEN IS A STORY ABOUT HOPE, FUN, SADNESS, AND FRIENDSHIP. WHEN FOUR CHILDHOOD FRIENDS MADE A PACT TO ALWAYS BE THERE FOR EACHOTHER, ONE, CHRISSY, FINALLY NEEDS THEM, AS SHE AWAITS THE ARRIVAL OF HER NEW BABY. SUDDENLY THE MOVIE DRIFTS YOU INTO THEIR CHILDHOOD IN A STORY ABOUT FOUR YOUNG GIRLS DISCOVERING NEW THINGS, EVEN THEMSELVES,AS THEY SET OUT TO FIND OUT ABOUT A YOUNG BOY WHO'S CROSSED OVER TO THE OTHER SIDE. WHILE THEY TAKE THIS JOURNEY THEY ENCOUNTER GOOD THINGS, BAD THINGS, SECRETS, SADNESS, MADNESS, AND TRIUMPH, ALL THAT LEADS UP TO FINDING THEMSELVES, KNOWING FRIENDS ARE GREAT TO HAVE AROUND, TO HAVE AT ALL, BUT SOMETIMES, YOU JUST NEED TO RELAX WITH YOURSELF. BE SURE TO WATCH THE ENDING AS CHILDREN, WHEN SAMMY VISITS THE GRAVEYARD AND FINDS ""CRAZY"" PETE THERE. IT'S A REAL TEAR JERKER, IT WILL TRULY TOUCH YOU."
2,This movie was... okay,"Since I've never seen Stand By Me, I can't tell you if this movie was a rip-off of it or not. I can tell you what I thought of it. It was okay. The young actresses were all pretty good. The adult actresses are merely there to lend their names, to show us what happened to the girls, and balance the ""then"" sequences with ""now"" sequences, so they can't really be expected to give excellent performances. Yes, this movie was filled with cliches, which got annoying after a while, but there were some good scenes, like the scene with Crazy Pete in the graveyard and the scene where Christina Ricci's character cried about her mother dying. All in all, this movie is really what they call a ""chick flick"", and it isn't one of the better ones, but it has its moments."
4,Good Movie.,I have always loved this movie! My sister got me to watch it when I was younger and I loved it. I had to buy it when I got older. I watch it often. It's about young girls growing up together. I recommend it.
4,Stand By Me,"This is one of my favorite films of all time. Four friends growing up in suburban Indiana; tomboy Roberta (Christina Ricci), future celebrity Teeny (Thora Birch), writer Samantha (Gaby Hoffman) and fat, goody-goody Chrissy (Ashleigh Aston Moore) spend the best summer of their lives in 1970 and make a vow to return to each other when they need each other. Twenty-five years later the women (Rosie O' Donnell, Melanie Griffith, Demi Moore and Rita Wilson) return to their Indiana town where Chrissy (Wilson) is pregnant. A great coming of age film with lots of sentimentality and adolescent discussions about sex (surprise!).A-"
2,"""Then& Nowe' iz badd 4 mee","""Then$nowe"" are badd moovey. I dodn""t liki it much, the peple in it wer badd. i liki ""Star Warz"" much better then ""Then&Nowe"".That badd, ""Star Warz"" good."
5,movie.,Classic movie. a movie you can watch over and over again. it will never get old to me. i love it.
4,Timeless Movie on Friendship,"I first saw this movie as a teenager and I loved the storyline.The four friends are compatible and each shines also as individuals.As an adult, I feel this is a timeless movie on friendship.I recommend seeing it!"
5,Awesome,"I was 12 when this movie came out, so how could I not love it? Such a wonderful movie with a great cast!"
5,now and then again!!!!,"Now And Then will bring back loads of memories!!Now And Then is a fabulous movie.I could watch it over and over again.This movie has great actors.Such as Christinna Ricci,Rosie ""o Donnel,and many more.I request this movie for anyone.Especially if you have alot of best friends.And you cant just choose one of them. So you can just keep all of them.In some parts,it can be emotional if you have a daughter.So go get this movie from blockbuster and watch it!"
3,Good Stuff,"I think the funniest part is the classic naked boys part! Funny funny. very funny and realistic how the teenage boys really don't have a problem with their masculinity or genitals being seen until the girls come up, they they're caught bare naked in front of the opposite sex and literally shrink up! And even more so have to run around in the forest naked and are also pre occupied with keeping [their selves] covered! That is realistic and funny! Wonder what the young actor were paid to do that one!"
4,works as described,It fit my whirpool drier but the plustic seems to stick into inside a bit more then construction of the mashine allows. But it did work and this is a great price.
4,Literature Text Book,"This is a text book, too big to be paper bound, but heaven help us if we had to pay a textbook hardback price. The selection is entertaining."
2,Disappointed,I understand that I was buying a used book and it was supposed to be in good condition. The book was not in what I would call good condition. The binding is bad so pages are falling out. I ordered this for my daughter who is in college and not close to home. She is going to keep it and use it because she needs a book. This is the first bad experience I have had.
3,Paper choice,"Definitely agree with other reviews - the choice of paper is terrible. The pages are made of bible-style pages, almost thinner in my opinion. They will rip very easily so do be careful flipping pages. Much like bible pages, the pages in this book are see-through onto the back side and next page as well. I suggest inserting a white piece of computer paper behind the page you are reading if you find it irritating to have words bleeding through. The book is fine though you might want to save yourself some cash in buying this book - about 3/4th of the content of the book are public domain books that you can download via Amazon Kindle for free."
4,Shades of Graham Greene's The Power and The Glory,"I picked up this book based on positive reviews it had received online (I believe via Bookslut), and I was not disappointed. It reminded me at times of Graham Greene's The Power and The Glory (one of my favorite novels, and another book about struggles with faith and religion gone wrong), and as other reviewers have noted, it's the kind of book that is hard to put down. It's also a harrowing story about abuses of power, which can make the novel's images hard to confront at times. The Book Of Night Women may be his current calling card, but James' work here is also worth your time."
5,Fantastic books for life-transformation and ascension,"I have read all of Annalee Skarin's books and they are a wonderful companion to the Life and Teachings of the Far East by Baird. T. Spalding and Door of Everything by Ruby Nelson. The books describe the power of ascension attitudes of love, praise and gratitude to transform one's life as well as how to effectively use one's power of imagination to turn the impossible dreams into reality. After you read these books you may set much higher goals for your life, goals that for many others would seem impossible. By the time you are finished reading these books, you will understand that nothing is impossible. If you can think it, you can manifest it. The books not only describe how to accomplish these seemingly impossible feats, but also give references from the lives of those who have actually accomplished them and Annalee Skarin is one of those rare individuals."
1,1 star is not a low enough rating for this book,"Annalee Skarin died in 1988. This woman, who also used the pen name ""Christine Mercie"", was described by her daughter, Hope Hilton, as a paranoid schizophrenic.I used to be a part of a cult - see my report at http://www.eth-s.com - and the leader based her writings and teachings on Annalee Skarin's books.Her tales of ""translation"" were pure fiction.There is absolutely NO truth to this author's claims, and her books will lead a person farther and farther AWAY from God.The only thing that healed me of the damage caused by these books and the cult I was in was the Word of God which is only found in one book : The Bible."
2,"AN ADMIRABLE ATTEMPT, A DISAPPOINTING RESULT","This book might serve an individual who's making this journey. On the other hand, it did not suffice when I used it in a graduate seminar on LGBT spirituality. It mostly has the flavor of 'Jesus loves me and I'm trans,'which I find less than satisfying or sufficient."
2,"Beautiful Puzzle, BUT IT COMES ASSEMBLED!!","This 3-D art jigsaw puzzle is simply amazing. As a collector of Oriental art, this work is so eye catching it has become one of my favorite pieces. The packaging/puzzle is directly from Japan. My only complaint would be that it comes assembled... IT'S NOT PACKAGED ASSEMBLED; THE SELLER HAS ASSEMBLED IT FOR YOU (GLUE AND ALL). As a jigsaw puzzle enthusiast, I was looking forward to the challenge in assembling the puzzle myself. I would recommend purchasing the product directly from Japan, unassembled!!!"
5,Daughter loves it,"Bought this for my teen daughter and she's happy with it :) (No, she's not one of those vampire weirdos lol.)"
4,Good read,"A good read...........amazing story of a man who lived life in the fast lane, bars, drinking, clubbing.............and turned his life around completely after a NDE where he was given a mission to accomplish in life. Good stuff"
2,Not Realistic!,"The story started out ok, but then begin to become unbelievable. For being a true story, It just seemed impossible as the story continued that all his happened, in his near death experience, were made up or terrible exaggerated!"
4,Very good reading,"A true testmony of a life experience. Ned shares with us , with great sensibility, his learning experience on the after death. He gives us a good opportunity to rethink our lives and why we are here."
2,Nothing out of the ordinary,"OK if, like me, you don't know of any better documentaries available - but it's not ""a classic""."
2,review,"Since the product description never says what year show this was filmed. It was filmed at the 2002 LA Roadster show. Not all the cars shown are roadsters though. Turn the sound off and put in your own music choice to watch this because the music can get annoying. You are not missing anything important with the hosts commentary and owners talking about their cars.You would think that with all the cars at this show that they wouldn't have to resort to showing so many cars more than once. But they end up showing several cars more than once! What is worse, is that you can see cars in the background that they should have been looking at. Not bad though."
2,"Shipped Fast, Price was good BUT......","This item shipped fast but when I got around to program it for my truck, it would not set the alarm!!! It would lock and unlock the doors but that was all it would do."
3,Keeps working but plastic housing is weak,"I got two of these with my alarm when I bought it a few years ago. The electronics inside are robust, although it requires a pretty expensive 12v battery. It has always worked fine when the battery was not dead. However, the plastic housing for this transmitter is pretty lame. In particular, the plastic loop that your key ring attaches to is underdesigned, and both of mine broke within 4 years. I keep my keys in my pocket, and this fob only ever had the one car key on it (house and office keys on a separate ring), so no great stress on it. If the plastic case were better designed this product would be pretty close to perfect."
2,More like The First Three Months ...,"This book has lots of information about the hospital stay and I would recommend only to parents whose baby has just been born. My baby has been home for several months, and because the title said ""The First Five Years"" I was very disappointed. There was very little of relevance to me now or for the future."
3,it was ok,"I honestly thought it would be about the first 5 years but it was mainly about the hospital stay. It did explained about procedures and things like that. It really didnt have anything about after, when they got to come home. No milestones info or catching up or maybe any problems your baby may have."
1,Not pleased!,This is useless to me after the first three months. No ongoing info given thereafter. I was/am not pleased.
3,preemie baby,This book was comprehensive and broke down the information into a simple format. It included many great pictures for references.
4,humerous,"These postcards are really boring, but they make for a funny collection of airport and shop postcards."
2,Maybe a little too boring,"I bought this gift as a ""funny"" Christmas present. Most of the pictures don't even look like they were postcards (just pictures) ... nor can you tell when / where they are from... and most of them are just pictures of interstates... the commentary under each of the picture is sort of random too... just not what I thought it would be..."
3,You might have been there!,"This makes an interesting gift for a friend or relative.If you are older than 45, or so, you have probably visited at least one of the places shown in these pictures!"
1,Boring is right!,"I read reviews before I purchased this book, and followed the advice of the positive ones. I actually sent this book back the day after I received it. Thank goodness for free return shipping. BORING BORING BORINGNothing fun about this book at all."
2,Boring Postcards,"In a ""nut shell"", I felt that this was not ""money well spent"".I enjoyed looking at the postcards, but was disappointed at how many were offered (only one per 6""x8"" page, total, about 175). I would have liked it a lot more if someone else had paid for it. Maybe I can sell it at a yard sale for a buck."
3,boring?,not sure why. its really a ok book .it was a freebie. it was a paperless book. why not take advantage of it right? not like WHOA! book!
3,Not postcards to be mailed. As a book it's......boring,"First a word of clarification. These are not postcards to be mailed. I didn't read the description clearly. This was only my fault, but someone else out there might make the same mistake.Second, the publisher's description and viewers' comments are correct: These are boring, charmless, insipid images, that might tell us a lot about who we think we are -- perhaps of how proud small-town America was of its new airports, bus terminals and banks after the war. But I thought that not including any reflections by a student of our culture (Lord knows there are enough candidates), was just plain cheap, and makes this little book, well, boring."
3,"Uhh, you guys are mistaken, at least I'm pretty sure.",Battle Royal High School has NOTHING to do w/ the live-action movie Battle Royale ...http://www.fpsmagazine.com/review/brhs.shtml
1,Low quality,"and hey, all you bozos out there, I've got news for you...THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE KOUSHUN TAKAMI NOVEL ""BATTLE ROYALE"", THE MANGA BASED ON THE NOVEL, OR THE SUBSEQUENT MOVIE DIRECTED BY KINJI FUKASAKUso stop being a bunch of morons comparing this to any of the above."
2,Really weird...,"...my sister found this movie from a friend. She had rented it and told her it was bad. Bad as in the footage. My sister saw it, said it was bad, and then I watched it......it had absolutely no plot. It seems more like a story written by a 3rd Grader. Nothing is explained and the ending leaves you wondering in mystery where these people came from, why they wanted to do what they did, and what happened which wanted to make them do what they had to do.Not to mention the blood, gore and unnecessary swearing in this film, it was an absolute waste of time. Nothing was explained, and it was very desturbing. Some people may like it, but in my opinion, this is trash. Try something else."
3,Kind of dated; not bad,"A group of aliens land on Earth hoping to be able to use Earth technology to help their own planet. Since they have landed in prehistoric times, they go into hibernation and wake up in the 1950s, where a doctor on a fishing trip finds them and tries to help. Kind of dated, run of the mill SF, but not bad."
4,Windows NT workstation.,bought this book because I needed to look up some things. A cheap buy but worth it especially when Microsoft stopped supporting it.
2,buyer beware,"I puschased this book on a whim after searching for novels specifically about this subject. I was hoping for something with some well thought out scientific basis. This story does not have it. Buyers should be aware that this is not published by a mainstream publisher. It's a publisher that specializes in allowing unpublished authors to get in print. The narrative has some vivid moments, but for the most part the characters are generic and flat. If you are fascinated by paranormal or psychic events, you may find this novel interesting, but in my opinion it is a very amateurish effort."
5,Rare violin blues.,"Although most tracks are guitar blues, the finest part of this compilation is, needless to say, ""violin blues"". It is a shame that this phenomenal blues violinist recorded only one violin blues song."
5,OK THIS IS IT,"it's nice that Tiziano and his record company understand the music industry it's on the verge of colapse, so they decided to included his two supreme hits of his previous work here as bonus track, it's surely a treat to anyone who do not owns the before, and that detail made me buy this, this is a very mature love album that would satisfied anyones taste for good music, TARDES NEGRAS is obscure and deep, PERVERSO it's upbeat and supreme, NO ME LO PUEDO EXPLICAR is one of those song you can't help to feel it, PERDONA it's great, ALUCINADO it's a very strong love song, the other tracks are just as nice, a very very logical album to buy."
5,classic Cuban music,"This is one of those CDs that needs to be included in any Cuban music collection. ""Caballo Viejo"" ""El Carretero"", ""El Viejo"" and the others are classic hits."
1,Outdated...,"This book is seriously outdated. Most Mormons would laugh at the arguments made here. You are much better off reading ""How Wide the Divide"""
1,Good Job Mr. Rhodes,"Wow, looks like Rhodes has found a way to make a good living by bashing others and stirring up controversy. Those who credit his work know nothing about Mormon teachings or the Book of Mormon since many of the things he brings out as true are out of context and completely false. On the other hand, those who use just a little intelligence can easily decipher his motives and quickly see his errors. Therefore I say Good job Mr. Rhodes, you reveal yourself very well, biases, ignorance, stupidity and all..........but I bet you make a good buck doing it, you smart devil you."
1,Religion and Politics,"Religion is best left up to God and those who choose to follow the teachings of a choosen religion. All the commentary or criticism on any religion is not necessary. This book is neither conclusive or ""christian"" It was a rather angry tirade of someone who wished to rid himself of a perceived pest. If the end result of a religion is good people (if followed principals and precepts correctly)then what is the harm in allowing those to believe what they will and agree to disagree on the process with the same conclusion."
1,*sigh* Another lost soul...,Ron Rhodes oviously has never read or attempted to do any research into The Book of Mormon. If you are looking for a book that will help you understand who or what the LDS(Church of Jeusu Christ of Later Day Saints) are then I highly recamend that you go to the LDS missionarys because this book just promotes noting but Falsehoods and lies about all that is true. For the sake of your eternal being please look somewhere else besides all the lies about mormons. When Ron realises in heaven what he has done by trying to spread lies about mormon dactrine in the form of a book for the gain of money he will feel unconfortable in the presence of God.
1,This isnt the way to learn,"I'm a member of the church, a convert too at that and I'm only 18. If you want to know what Mormons believe, ask a believer. Not some sourer person who has some sort of vendetta against the Church. I've researched the Church a lot, and yeah I don't know everything, no one does, why should we have all the answers now? True, us members don't know everything about the Church but there are a lot of scriptures to read and memorize! Even if you don't believe, this is America, and this country was founded on religious freedom. Please do not discriminate against me or any one else that believes something that you don't, whether it is Mormons, Catholics, Jews, Buddhists, Satin worshipers, or gays. Don't read anti-Mormon propaganda to know more about Mormons, I don't read anti-Catholic propaganda to know more about Catholics."
1,Mormons are Christians,"Latter-Day Saints are Christians. If you want toknow about Mormons ask an active LDS member. Ifyou want to know how to fix a car you don't ask aprofessional dog groomer. Ask God, the EternalFather if the Book of Mormon is true. If you have asincere heart and pray with real intent, God willmanifest the truth of it by the power of the HolyGhost and by the power of the Holy Ghost you may know thetruth of all things. A book that slams another's religionis a very sad and frightening thing and it isn't Christ-Like!"
5,Excellant book on the subject!,It's funny how people are so against someone who uses scripture to teach a group that their beliefs contradict the Bible.I guess they want Mormons to continue to live in darkness.I guess they want Mormons to continue to believe that God was once a man and that every man can become a god.I guess they also had a problem when Jesus corrected those whose teachings went against the word of God.If someone is on a path that is leading them off of a cliff and to destruction are we supposed to let them continue on that path or get them on the right path to salvation?
2,Reader,"The book is in its foundation antagonistic, rather than an attempt to understand Mormon doctrine. I was looking for a book to educate me, not equip me with the best vitrialic one-liners to retain in case I get in an argument with a Mormon. I'm still looking for a book that is not biased one way or another. I suppose I'll just have to suck it up and read the Book of Mormon itself."
2,Nothing here that will make sense to a Mormon,"While I welcome accurate criticism, this book falls far from the tree. If you are a Protestant or Catholic wanting to convert Mormons to your brand of Christianity, using this book will really make you look dumb. Anyone that has been to LDS Sunday school or skimmed the Standard Words (King James edition of the Holy Bible - Old & New Testaments, Book of Mormon, Doctrine and Covenants, Pearl of Great Price) will think someone asking these questions is brain washed and you won't get anywhere with them. This book is clearly to keep Protestant flocks from looking too far outside their own world, not for getting LDS Christians to move away from their faith."
1,"not what I have been taught,and I'm78","I am a member of the church. I thought I would read this to see what could be so horrible that someone had to write a book about asking member of the LDS faith questions. Couldn't this author ask someone themself?Sharing the teachings of Christ with anyone is wonderful.I am concerned about the untrue statements. That the church does not believe in the Bible. Every Sunday, since I was little girl, we have learned teachings from the bible. Old testament, New testament, we believe the scriptures to be true. The only reference to it being traslated correctly is that we prefer the King James Version and do not use others, such as Amplified or NIV. I have never heard anyone say the Bible is not true.We also believe The Book of Mormon, Another Testament. It testifies of Jesus, who we do believe is our redeemer. I would not recommend this book. The author seems to be bias, and misinformed.Note:my daughter typed this for me, thank you."
1,Anit-Mormon Trash,"Look, if you want to read Anti-Mormon trash, this book is for you. If you really want to find out what Mormons believe, just ask one. They tell you what they believe without 'forcing' you to change. You find out the truth, make your own decisions, and do what you gotta do. No ifs, ands, or buts. Do go wasting time with someone obviously bitter and hateful (doesn't seem Christian-like to me)."
1,Not particularly poignant,"Shortly after starting to read this book I noticed such bias hatred. I normally would have stopped reading, but of course couldn't because I was interested in what other untruths he's written about. It is obvious this author isn't interested in inter-faith discussion, rather bible based bashing. He at no time uses the bible to teach properly, he uses it as a means to separate and divide Mormons from a heartfelt gospel teaching. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone seeking to find answers on the Mormon faith, that is unless you're looking for a confrontational explanation and tools to alienate any future dealings you might have while attempting to bring others to Christ, Mormon or otherwise."
1,Garbage,"What makes Anti-Mormons to be so destructive? I can only think that they hide an enormous fear. No doubt Satan is so powerful! If people became more respectful and tolerant of beliefs, this world would be a more pleasant place to live."
1,WhY?,"Why spend your time, resources, and breath fighting against something you haven't given a chance? Can you truly say you don't like chocolate without ever trying it? My advice to the erroneous mormon bashers: get a life and do something CONSTRUCTIVE with it."
1,Waste of reading time.,"This rag wasn't terribly researched, and very biased. Perhaps written by a former member of the Church that was dis-fellowshiped? Hmmmm.........And no, I am not LDS. In fact, I'm Jewish. However, I lived in Provo for two years, and found my Mormon neighbors to be very lovely people. I was never ""black balled"" or shuned. They were all helpful and nice. I was never pushed, and they respected my own faith.Sorry, but the book missed the mark and tanked."
1,sucks butt,"This book is lame, I have better common sense than to need someone to tell me how to have a simple conversation with a mormon. Save your money. I'm glad I only rented it from the library."
1,This is what Christianity is about,I don't understand what kind of mentality bashes other religions. I think we should rejoice in what is good in each other not tear each other down. I was very disappointed in the lack of the author's apparent research.
5,House Party - Buy One Get One Free,If you Love House buy the 2 disc set and save almost 50%. I was doing research on House and stumbled across the Season 3 & 4 set from Amazon. It's a Steal!
5,This Is The Best Excel Development Book Ever!,"Stephen and Rob are clearly masters of the art of Excel application development and have an incredible ability to explain the advanced techniques they use in a way that makes them seem easy. ""Professional Excel Development"" sets a new standard for Excel technical books and looks to become the standard reference book for the industry. Mastering the techniques in this book has already helped me move toward the head of the Excel development pack! I highly recommend it."
5,Childhood Memories of Christmas,"When I saw this book it reminded me of Christmastime when I was child. Things seemed so simple then and Christmas was not as commercialized as it is now. Also, we weren't reluctant to sing religious songs at Christmas because, back then, nobody would find it offensive. This book has the words to a lot of old favorites as well as black and white illustrations for each. The book I received had a different picture on it, I'm not sure I like it as well as this one, but the book is in excellent condition and I am very pleased with it."
1,Yes we know it's Christmas,"Now if you ask me, and many aging pop stars with a philanthropic bent do now and again, Midge Urea and Bob Gandalf should have just re-released the 1984 version and saved us all the earaches. It was a nice thought, but it sounds like they didn't arrange much studio time to pull this one off. It lacks 100% of the emotion of the first version and the added rapping segment is completely disrupting to the whole thing. The piano intro is nice and it's too bad the entire things wasn't just the piano being played and Paul Hewson belting out his trademark line from 1984.I'd give this one a miss. Junior done gave it five thumbs down when I played it the first time and we ain't played it since."
3,Sounds like the band is in slow motion,"Recorded live, almost every song is a beat or two slower than it should be. Impact and pace is much better on the studio recordings and even with the other live recording on the Alligator label. If one must have a Hound Dog recording (and you should), this is not it. I would get his first studio release from Alligator. It's the most tasty of the bunch (and it's the only one I have on LP and it sounds the best.....perfect sound forever with compact disks, ha!)."
1,Oh Buck. This is where you went wrong.,"You took a good American made brand, and sullied it by having stuff made in china.In the product description, it was never said where the knife was made.Since I have lots of Buck knives, it was a given this was American made.Not so. This is a piece of crap that was made in china. It's didn't even last a month before it started falling apart.Thanks for the junk Buck!"
3,Very little knife!!!,"This knife is a great quality for the money,But, it's so small you have to get used to opening it. It is for a scholarly type to carry.Meaning just to use when you absolutely have too. Great ""Be prepared""knife..."
3,The bay's freestyle diva,"I am from the bay area and know of this artist, I always liked this song ,it's easy to dance to and sounds like a disco freestyle type of song. This is not a bad single, just needs a couple of more freestyle sounding remixes."
5,Typically brilliant Dunnett feast,"I have read Spring of the Ram several times, and got it for my Kindle since I know I would want it on hand. Mystery surrounds Niccolo, and this one sets him on course to enter the world of De Medici level finance, along with a million other seemingly tiny things. Dense reading, however. Not for the faint-of-heart, but worth the trip."
5,I wish I knew Italian,"I remember the first time I heard Andrea Bocelli sing ""Time to Say Goodbye"" and I wanted to listen to everything Bocelli. I feel the same way the first time I heard Patrizia sing on this cd. I absolutely love this album! The only problem is that I wish I knew Italian."
4,It's a good date movie,The movie is about this small town kid who moves to L.A. to be the drummer in a Salsa Band. His life goes from zero to sixty in about 10 minutes. He gets mixed up with these trite old school mafia guys and a weird cop.He also gets the cute girl at the end. It is predictable but still kind of fun to watch.You should also check outMy Best Friend's Girl (Unrated )
4,angels review,"I really liked this movie, I thought it was very funny and creative. I think Randy Spelling is a pretty good actor, at least he did a good job in this movie."
1,WORTHLESS MOVIE - NOT RECCOMENDED,"This Movie is neither for people looking for titillation , nor for Action / Adventure etc. The Movie does not match the reviews and has been a waste of Money for me"
4,"Hard Trance, hard to find, hard to beat.","I had originally purchased this cd @ Tower Records years ago but it was stolen from my car.Tower Records stopped carrying it then the went out of business.I searched for it and got it from Amazon at a better price than what I paid the first time.This cd is loaded with fast,hard and heavy trance tracks.I've tried many but this is the best compilation I've ever heard.It's also opened me up to many more songs and albums from the artists listed here too.This is a great cd for working out to, cranking up in the car or on your home system.If you love the pulse ponding energy of hard trance then look no further."
2,sloppy,"I would only recommend this cd to anyone who is not a DJ, only because if a dj were to listen to this, they would want to slap DJ Session One in the face. Throughout both of the discs nearly every transfer was completely sloppy, and totally uncalled for from a professional DJ. The tracks on disc one a very good, hard as all hell, i own at least five of them and play them all the time. disc two is sadly pathetic, way too mellow and should not have even been included in this two disc set. like i said i would not recommend this cd to a dj or anyone who is actually into the whole dance scence only because they will be very dissapointed at the talent of blutonium boy, he needs to stay in the studio and off of the decks. when your a dj, your only as good as your first mix and his was awful. if however you are into it just for the tracks and not the talent, please go ahead and buy this cd. reluctant 2 stars only for production."
5,Immediate difference in my life,"This book has made an immediate difference in my life. I got it at the library and then had to buy it so I can refer back to it. I implemented the desktop filing system, and I haven't had papers piling up on my kitchen counter for the first time in twenty years. I've read a lot of organizing books, but this one was the most helpful to me. Real change in my life. Gotta love it."
5,awesome!!!! file system idea rocks (and works) !,Very good book! Reads quickly! My biggest find in this one was her idea about filing system!!! It works! It has been life-changing :)
2,Good Program made worse...,"Upgraded from the earlier version of Hallmark Card Studio. Noticed right away that the nice graphic telling you how to flip the paper over to make a 2-sided card was much smaller and much more difficult to see how I should flip the paper to the correct orientation, but I didn't let that deter me.Graphics are nice, and you get a reasonable selection, but once you narrow your search down, it isn't that impressive of a selection anymore, and really didn't add that many more cards from the last version. You will eventually run into problems printing particular cards for which Sierra has posted fixes. However...After some update (need to keep Windows updated after all), I can no longer print any cards. Sierra takes forever to fix their bugs or to help you out. Might be tempted to blame the Windows update...but if that were true, all my programs would be broken, not just this one. Truth be told, Sierra doesn't do a particularly good job of programming or support..."
1,Sierra Hallmark Card Studio 2003,"Purchases first CD several months ago. Quit opening after a little while. Traded at retailer for another. Same problem. Have not been able to open ""Hallmark Card Studio 2003"" portion of program but other parts were ok. Now Dialog states program needs 800x600- and more than 256 colors.Have these but problem still exists.Have plenty of space.New Dell System. As of this date,03-27-03,can't download any of programs. in color. Each time I try to re-install programs..an error dialog pops up advising me to report this to Microsoft.Have American Greeting Cards programs and all perform perfectly."
2,Disappointed by newer version...,"When I first discovered Hallmark Card Studio (CardStudio2 deluxe)I was elated to have found a user friendly card program with so many options to personalize for just about any card giving need.I was so impressed with the program, that as quickly as Card Studio 2003 hit the shelves, I purchased it. I loaded it onto my computer and sat back to be amazed at all the new ""stuff"" that I believed would have been added. I was so disappointed. For starters, the entire format has been changed. There were fewer cards to pick from and apparently, users of this program have no reason to send a get well card, because that entire catagory doesn't even exist on this program! Basically, this program is a smaller ""updated"" version of Card Studio Deluxe 2, because there were fewer cards and many repeats from my previous version. My advice...if you have an earlier version of Hallmark Card Studio. Keep it. Do not think UPGRADE. You'll be disappointed, as well."
2,Disappointing,"Way to limited in the card selections, ok for my husband as you can pick ""blah blah blah"" cards. I was looking for more fun or exciting cards or designs so, I was a little disappointed especailly coming from Hallmark."
1,Not what I thought,"This movie was just not what I had expected....it was not the Baby Looney Tunes cartoon, that my son soo enjoys. It is more like toys playing...not cartoon characters, was disappointed, and would like to know if and where Baby Looney Tunes are available on DVD..."
4,"Nice substantial bracelet, ""showy"" piece","This bracelet is a good width and a good weight. This is not a piece that goes unnoticed on the wrist. If you are a woman that likes ""big"" jewelry this is a nice piece.I like this bracelet enough that I am planning on purchasing a necklace to wear with this and I am a picky consumer. This piece is equally nice with jeans or a black suit.I recommend both this product and this seller."
5,Really pretty bracelet,I recieved a bracelet that was as advertised and fairly priced. The bracelet was in perfect condition and nicely packaged. It arrived promptly after I paid for it and I would happily do business with these people again.Thank you!
4,A Winter oof Words,A WINTER OF WORDS is the best book ever written about the City Colleges of Chicago (and the only one).
1,total crap,this book is trash. Engler is a conflicted sad man who likes sulk in his book. Pls. dont cry me a river Mr. Engler.you are a Eurocentric nutcase and need to go to a mental hospital.
5,Ana Vidovic: Guitar Virtuoso,Just watch and especially listen wonderful guitar virtuoso Ana Vidovic and enjoy beautiful music! All compositions are fantastic and the video has been made perfectly. The interview is also interesting.
4,Good price,Works fine. Individual wires could have been color coded like all of the others to more easily match the connections on the back of the dryer. Good price.
5,perfect fit,was unable to find anything over 6ft in any of the stores around my area. This cord worked perfect. i didnt have any issues with install and product continues to work fine.
5,Dryer Cord,Item was perfect.....we needed a longer dryer cord than the standard 6 foot ones. I couldn't be happier... Thanks!!
5,Exactly as described,"This is the 3-wire dryer cord, exactly as described. I liked the picture on the website, as this made ordering so much easier."
5,does the job,"This power cord is one of the only of its length. Quality is good, and it was easy to install."
1,A backup harddrive that needs its own backup!,"Like other users I had a terrible experience with this drive. The short of it - it lasted 2 years (longer than most other reviews) and one day just stopped working and started making a loud grinding noise. I contacted the mfg who said it couldn't be replaced because it was out of warranty and I would need to use a third party to recover my data from the device. I contacted their recommended third party vendor who estimated the charge to be around $3,000 (and no I didn't mistype a zero). I called a few other places and found them to be wayyyyy on the high end - other quotes were around $500 to just under $1,200. I just found out yesterday that because of the cheap hardware in this thing I have a 50% chance of recovering my data. Fingers crossed and prayers lifted up, I hope I get it all back. Don't waste your money on this thing. This is one harddrive that needs a backup harddrive. Geez!"
1,Dead in 30 days,"Tricky to setup. Worked on Vista, took a few tries to get it to appear in XP. Worked fine for 30 days, but the power supply died. Can't even return it, since I already threw out the box.Update:Contacted support for a new cable, they said another department would have to call me back. Ok. No one ever did. I called again and got the same response. Three weeks later, I got two new power adapters in the mail."
1,Waste of Money.,"It is a bad hardrive, hes right on some XP systems it works on others it doesn't! Mine didn't work on my XP system, my fiance's or my cousins but did on my brothers. Unreliable. Also when it finally does work, it tends to ""disappear"" with no traces to be recognized again. Definately NOT plug-in-play, checked Maxtor's website, now that they are bought out by Sea-Gate, no drivers for this exist on their website. The Drivers are on my computer when you plug it in, BUT the unit is not recognized. I'm not the only one either, I've checked the review for this drive on about 5 different websites and about 80% of the reviews said the same thing I am, unreliable and doesn't like to be recognized. Cheap, but you get what you pay for, GARBAGE."
2,File access problems,I have had this drive for about 6 months now. I have had a few file access problems when I move files from one folder to another within the drive. I lose access to these files for some reason. Saw on the web and someone mentioned about permissions on the files. It is wierd that I am able to access the same files before the move but cannot access it after the move into a brand new folder. I tried changing folder and file ownership (in safe mode) and it works. But I have to to this for each and every folder and file that needs to be changed. Very annoying.
1,Horrible - Only a matter of time before it crashes!,"This drive failed after 6 months of use. Windows XP will no longer recognize it - and I get a code 10 error. Seagate/Maxtor was useless and says the drive is dead.It turns out, that the USB controller that is inside the enclosure has likely failed - hence Windows XP can't get the drive to start. Breaking the drive from its enclosure and either putting it in a new external enclosure (which will come with a new USB controller), or installing it into a bay on your computer, may fix the problem. But as is, as an external hard drive, this is the worst. Poorly designed and with very cheap components.Any positive reviews for this drive have probably been written before problems that will inevitably arise.I would avoid all Maxtor and Seagate drive from this point forward."
4,A superb product but NO Power switch,"This is a great external harddrvie, very quite and fast. The only drawback is there is no power switch to disconnect the power when I finish using it. I find it very inconvenient as every time I have to unplug the power cord. Other than this, a superb product."
5,"Silky, Silky Soul.","I think time will favor these recordings of Adams, especially those he did with Rounder Records. ""Room With A View..."" was my late introduction to Johnny Adams and I was so taken by his vocals that I also got ""Walking on A Tightrope"" and the Doc Primus tribute...if you are into great soulblues vocalists like Al Green, Aaron Nevell, or Lou Rawls, you will love the late, great Johnny Adams. That I promise you."
3,Didn't fit,"The cone comes with several inches of reflective tape. I didn't know why until I received it. The cone is too big to stay on the flashlight head unless you build it up with several layers of tape.The shipping cost was minimal, so the S&H; handling charge was mostly for ""Handling."" It's breathtaking that it would cost more to handle this order than it would to pay for the merchandise itself."
1,bad fit,This just doesn't fit the C-cell Maglite quite right. Giving to my security worker friend who uses a D-cell Maglite.
3,Pretty Recording of Italian Belcanto,"Margiono's specific timbre is beautifully underscored by her four partners. The recording is a nice and unusual addition tothe current recordings of 'Arie Antiche' by Bartoli, Bayo, Vargas, Bruson and Bergonzi.However, The Margiono Quintets Producers might consider a more original selection of Arie Antiche. Parisotti's collectioncontains more than 84 items to choose from.Only four of the 17 pieces on the CD are not in Schirmers selection of 24 Italian Arias - standard literature for any student of belcanto.Ladies and Gentlemen - please surprise us ... !Patrick B. Ludwig"
1,Poorly Written,"After reading ""Refiner's Fire"" I felt compelled to write a brief review in an effort to prevent others from wasting both time and money. Written with a third grade vernacular (and sense of humor) this ""Christian Romance Novel"" is in complete disagreement with virtually every element necessary in defining both ""Christianity"" and the term ""novel."" In fact the author's complete disregard for prose and structure are just stepping stones to the greater realization that this book is lacking nearly every facet typically found within an ENTERTAINING novel. Moreover, her general disregard for Christianity is appalling. ..."
1,Disgraceful to say the least!!!!,"After reading this book I was outraged that it even found it's way to print!!! I enjoy ""Christian"" novels because I feel I can read them and not be offended by language or description of events. When I saw that this book was written by a Director of Nursing at a nursing home I was interested to read it because I am beginning the search for a nursing home for my mother to live out her final years. I was appalled to see the way this writter used her patients and staff in this very poorly written book. I found this book to be less than entertaining and certainly not humorous or ""Christian"". I could not finsih reading and it is now in the trash where it belongs. One star is far too many for this book!!!! Two of my friends bought it the same time I did and they feel the same way I do. I am sure you can soon read their reviews."
1,Terrible book!,"This book is one of the worst books I have ever read. The author makes fun of the elderly AND staff alike in the nursing home. It is NOT what I would consider a Christian book, full of vulgar insults and name-calling. ... It is NOT a humorous or entertaining story at all, it is idiotic, and juvenile. ... This book is a disgrace! ..."
5,Fantastic songwriter and singer,"This singer and songwriter has been singing since he was around seven, probably on the buses and sidewalks of Mexico. He's now one of Mexico's top and most beloved cultural icons. His songs are exquisite. It truly is hard to choose a favorite among them. 'Tatuajes' ('Tatoos' - I carry tatoos of your kisses all over my body... is excellent, but so is ""Gracias por tanto amor', which on this disc, he dedicates to his fans.) Ladies love him because he knows what ladies like to hear, and gents love him because he teaches them how to woo, or at least expresses with great artistry what they would like to be able to.Sigh. What a wonderful songster!"
3,Not for alcoholics...,"I read that book and thought it was certainly helpful and could be useful for problem drinkers. However, if you are an alcoholic, this book could give you false hope that you can beat the disease. Some people just can't drink. While the techniques in the book are certainly efficient, I did not like the overly positive tone and the way they are presented, like they are some kind of magic potion against problem drinking. Just be really careful."
3,Not for hard drinkers,The book is well written and includes good guidelines to follow if you are not a serious drinker.
2,Avoid RVG,Avoid the RVG remaster of this CD. The non-RVG sounds much better. The RVG is compressed and harsh sounding. The non-RVG sounds warm and inviting with better bass.
4,Blue Note gem,"Except for a very agitated and fidgety bonus track, this is a very successful album for Wayne Shorter. He's at his most lyrical on a number of tracks, backed up beautifully by pianist Herbie Hancock, bassist Reggie Workman, and especially drummer Joe Chambers, who is supportive without being overpowering. The title track is an up-tempo 24-bar blues that really gets the feet moving: it's both funky and hip. 502 BLUES reveals Shorter in a most delicate mood, and the tune has just the right late-night flavor. EL GAUCHO is a tricky little tune with lots of key changes in the theme and a swinging latin beat. TERU is a beautiful ballad by Wayne and features a handsome solo by Workman. The bonus track, THE COLLECTOR, by Hancock, is too busy for my tastes, but what's come before is impressive work by this excellent modern jazz group. The Blue Note sound is magnificent, as usual."
1,Switching mechanism meltdown!,"I bought a package of these locally and used them to turn on/off a heater (within the UL listed wattage capacity). To my dismay, I found that the internal nylon switching mechanism had melted leaving the switch permanently in the on position. Beware."
4,Good product. Inadequate installation instructions.,"The instructions supplied with this spa cover lift are minimal and difficult to follow. Video instructions were provided by the seller, but skipped the most difficult parts of the installation. Nevertheless, the cover, once installed, works well."
3,Good but not Great,"Pluses: with the aid of a cordless drill and a driver, the installation took about 40 minutes; the cover stands up on end at the edge of the spa and does not have to be lowered and then raised from the ground level as with lifts that mount at grade - in this position the cover offers concealment for privacy; there is a locking mechanism that holds the cover in upright position until you release it to be lowered.Minuses: the instructions are a bit unclear in some areas; the gas shocks are grossly undersized - leaving the effort level at near 'dead lift' exertion to operate the unit - this is a big draw back for me, the wife still cannot open and close the unit by herself.With that being said the unit is still an improvement over a low mount cover lift, but not much!"
4,Hot tub cover lift,"This is definitely the way to go in lifting the cover of the hot tub. For us older folks and lazy younger one, this makes the work a breeze. The upright position was great in keeping it a little more private. It was very easy to install also. You have to be very careful about releasing the lever when folding or you might get a pinch. For that reason alone, I did not give it the five star."
5,Great replacement transmitter for Nissan Sentra,Got this on Amazon as a replacement for our transmitter for our Nissan Sentra at a much cheaper price than we had paid for one previously. It is the exact one I had gotten before and works great!
1,Frustration,I'm very frustrated with the product because it didn't come with instruction on how to program the item. I rated it with one star since I can't use the product to give it a decent rating. :(
1,Wrong program,"Sorry for late responsed, I have try this product it doesnt work or program not match."
5,Embodiment of the wonderful cartoon character,"I love the Mutts cartoons because the artist supports humane efforts and frequently features rescue animals in his strips. His love for the cat Mooch and the dog Earl shines from the printed page and I find it inspiring. I wanted these ""toys"" to embody the characters. I have them on a shelf in my house."
3,Stone turns out a winner in folk/funk style...,"Robin Stone's CD ""My Heart"" dances along the fine edge between folk music, spiritual rock, and funk. Her voice comes through with a rare clarity and power that never relents and never grates either. The music is well put together with changes that keep the listener on their toes and melodies that stick to the soul. Backed by a tight band reminiscent of modern folk-rock powerhouses like Dave Matthews, Robin's provocative songs make the listener groove, dance, smile and think.By far the gems of the disc are ""Scattered"", a funky piece about the hardships of daily living that features a killer instrumental jam section, and ""I Guess"", an emotional and sometimes darkly sarcastic ode to thoughtless friends.This disc is a welcome addition to any music collection. Robin Stone is not just another ""singer-songwriter chick"", she's a dynamo of musical talent and insightful lyric artistry."
3,Worth your time and money,"This is my first ""Wolfman only"" album. I have several compilation albums. I have felt that this was a good purchase! I don't like to play it with a crowd over, but on the road or during a slow afternoon the Wolfman can ease you into the night..."
1,"A LOATHSOME, VACUOUS, WORTHLESS VOLUME","If there ever was an art book that you shouldn't waste your time with, this is the one! Written as an exercise in pure egomania, the only thing Collings manages to communicate is how little he respects his readers' intelligence, taste, or personal integrity. The relentless ""I'm oh so smart and sophisticated, while you're not and never will be"" screed gets really old after about 3 pages but drones on until the bitter end. No need for Syrup of Ipecac when you have a monograph like this around! About the only thing one can learn from such a sorry excuse for a book is not to waste more money on any other birdcage liner the (putative) author has dumped into the marketplace. I felt bad that the lowest grade I could give it was one star: it actually deserved a minus five."
3,It's good but ...,"'This is Modern Art' is a book accompanying the ch.4 TV series of the same name, and this fact became all too obvious after I purchased it. The text does not read well: it seems as though the publishers have lifted Matthew Collings' voice-over from the TV programmes and transcribed it directly onto the pages of the book. Sure, there are plenty of nice photorgraphs and the tone is lively and informative, but reading the book - actually reading the text - is a strange experience as the words on the page do not work as words on a page: I kept wanting to read aloud and listen to myself speaking. The book is full of phrases and sentence construction that is made for the ear, not text that has been written to be read.The TV series was very good, but sadly this book is too close to a script of that series - and not what it should be: a BOOK about Modern Art."
4,Post Apocalyptic Gender Queers,"""Bone Dance"" is a really great thought provoking book. It's set in a near future post-apocalyptic Minneapolis, and for quite a while it's unclear if the narrator of the book, Sparrow, is hiding something about a mysterious past, or if memories of the past have been obliterated through nefarious means. It's hard to describe, but an amazing read even for those who aren't a fan of sci-fi or futuristic books. I would definitely suggest tracking down this book to read or give to others."
1,Never been able to finish,"I have picked this book up at least half a dozen times and tried starting from the begining and where I had left off last. No time have I ever finished it which is a very rare occurance for me. I loved War For the Oaks by Bull and found her other stories that I have read very good as well. Despite the devoted fandom for this work however, and it's noted critical praise, I have never been able to see what others do. I personally find it too scattered to be able to follow the story."
4,This is one of my favorites.,"This is a fairly interesting apocalyptic fantasy. Sparrow is a trader who specializes in restoring and preserving recording/sound/media equipment, and locating old movies. When Sparrow is approached to find a banned (possibly mythological) movie about ""The Horsemen"" (psychics who worked for the government as special ops before they started world war three and destroyed everything) The Horsemen come looking for Sparrow, which results in some extremely bad things happening to Sparrow and friends.I'm really happy that this was reprinted, the new cover art is really great."
5,Incredible,"This book is great. A unique premise, characters you really care about, and a great story. Plenty to like, and it manages to be mystical without being fluffy. I'd say more, but if I do I'll give a way the story -- go into this with a blank slate for best effect. Damn shame it's out of print as of this writing -- this book deserves a lot better."
1,Self-discharges very quickly,"I just tried to use two of these batteries, both brand new in packaging. The use by date is '2014'Neither battery worked in my device. When I tested the voltage, one read 3.4V and the other read 4.6V. This is supposed to be a 9V battery. Needless to say, they both went in the trash. I pulled out an old Duracell that had ""Use By Mar 2012"". Voltage? 9.0V.It's not worth buying a cheap Ultralast battery if it doesnt work when you need it."
2,It's as much fun as being on an archeological dig!,"I don't know which I'd rather do, play this game again or spend a day digging through hardened clay soil with a paintbrush. Let's see, when I think about the tedium and motor skills required to set this game up, and even more to play it, and then the real fun of putting away all those little pieces in the multiple plastic bags which the makers thoughtfully include, I think I'd take door number two. Just let me find my paintbrush and get some plane tickets."
3,Solid work on the Kingdom of God,A very helpful and exegetically detailed work that argues for both a current presence and future fulfillment of the kingdom of God.
4,Love this show!,"So glad it's finally available on DVD. Wish they had put some effort into improving the sound, etc, from 1976 standards but its still great."
5,alice season 1,if you were a fan when this was aired in the mid 70's you will love the dvd!!! yes indeedy!!! yes indeedy!!!
3,I was all excited when I heard the news of Alice's release until...,I was all excited when I got an email that Alice was gonna be released on DVD. Until I came on here and found out it was a DVD-r release. I can record onto a blank dvd-r myself I dont need to pay 40 dollars to have Amazon do it (& the quality of packaging n quality of cd-rs/dvd-rs released by Amazon are not as high quality or to my liking. Warner etc does better). If your ok way dvd-rs or a super fanatic of Alice and just have to have no matter what then i say buy it but if you want the real thing/traditional dvds then I say wait n hope it comes out later.
3,alice,I like that there is no ads. I can watch it anytime and anywhere.But the only thing is when i put the screen on full screen the picture skips a lot and pause every second.I would like to watch the shows in full screen.So if that were fixed everything else is very good.The fact that can watch Alice were there is no where else to watch it at is all right by me.
2,more 70s 80s liberal moralizing,"What were my parents thinking letting me watch this stuff. The weird thing is I thought I had fond memories of this show. Then I watch this show now and see all the liberal propaganda and attempts at liberal moralizing. Good grief. I don't think my parents were thinking. Nothing but sexual innuendo, trying to use TV to shame people into liberal thought control, and cheesy one liners. This show was horrible. Someone said once (and I never understood it until lately) that the 80s made 70s look like the 60s after having lived through the 50s. I agree. The 70s was nothing but a vile decade. And this show is proof positive. This show had episodes on gays, gun control, unwed mothers, gender bias, etc."
5,Alice was a great series,"What I don't care for is no ark work,I could handle that but no episode guide to help u know what episode u like to watch first I didn't have any scratch on my set as of yet I would still buy but I got to get the episode guide for each season to help me know what episodes to enjoy"
2,not good for beginners,"the author though explained few points clearly, did not delve more into cmos design issues in it. there were hardly any examples provided by the author. this book is just a brief introduction to different types of references but nothing much understandable atleast to the beginners.Main improvements to the book can be(1)more number of solved examples as well as unsolved problems.(2)more detailed understandable explanation to higher order bandgap references and designing issues for the novice designers.(3) complicated math made easy to understand(4) simulation techniques - can provide with some practical spice circuit etc etc.certainly not recommended for beginners."
2,Badly organised and hard to read,"I bought this book for a professional reference forCMOS voltage circuits. The information within thebook is arranged very oddly. For example, the chapteron PTAT voltage/current generation comes before thechapter on bnadgap voltage references. But a new readerwould probably have no idea why they would want a PTATsource until they had read the latter chapter.It's a bit odd really, because the Prof. has published somegood stuff on the web which explains the basics really well.This book does not even cover the basic ideas all thatwell.Check out the publications of Barrie Gilbert, he doesit much better.For students, there are almost no worked examples and thepoor book organisation makes it a very hard read."
1,Poorly written and unorganized,"The book does do a good job of highlighting the challenges of designing good references. It also talks about some of the difficulties (Eg trim, PTAT effects, package effects)However, the book is very difficult to follow and the chapters don't flow from one to the others. Certainly not something that I can access frequently in my library.Also there are no exercises for the reader to do so that the concepts remain entrenched in his mind.I would not purchase this book but rather do a google search on this.My background: I have 15yr experience doing analog IC design."
2,OK,I got this album about six years ago after hearing 'The Man Machine'. 'The Telephone call' is amazing but the others are dissapointing. Now I step back and think before buying a Kraftwerk CD.
5,Kraftwerk inventing beats while everyone in diapers,"So this was the final studio album for a whole 17 years before Tour De France Soundtracks. And yes, people had naturally decided that Kraftwerk was done for, didn't buy the album, and it becomes a sort of goat. Granted, they had something different planned post Computer World, but with one thing and another, it was not to be.Instead, we get some sick, silly beats from the original electronic reich. This thing has dated damn well on the first 'side' of the disc. Kraftwerk, as usual, were doing their thing and making the beats that so many would sample and eventually try to rewrite as dance and electronic music split into 75,000 sub-genres in 20 years.Yes, Electric Cafe is the theme from Sprockets, the SNL skit, but they used a sped-up version. The album is short, and sure, it's not as 'classic' as the earlier efforts, but it's Kraftwerk in 1986 using the 'latest' kit, including samplers and the like, and making a fine record."
4,Now is time . . .,. . . on Sprockets when we dance! This album provided the theme song for Dieter's (Mike Meyers) East German art show on SNL in the early 90s. I rate it only because of that.
2,Leaky Kraft,"Its a good thing Kraftwerk stopped producing after this. Its their worst album. Still has moments and the Telephone Song is great, but it goes dwonhill. The track Electric Cafe is a good example of how they began to lose their edge. And Kraftwerk is all about perfection. All the previous albums being so solid.Maybe they werent happy with this and packed it up to do something new. I dont know what because I did not follow them since.Theres also a remix of the Telephone Song which is good.Have no fear, all the previous albums were stellar, even back in the Organization and Neu days and the organic sound."
4,a few inches from a real masterpiece,"Second from an end album by deutsch electrolegends Kraftwerk is not as ill-fated as it's never released predecessor Techno Pop, but still shows lack of energy and self confidence as we all feel on Computerwelt. Also, personally I couldn't catch the main idea of this album, if it's 'Electric Cafe', then what do tracks like Sex Object do here? Anyway, if you like Kraftwerk, you'll be amazed by general sound and feel of this album. It's only a few inches from a real masterpiece."
4,"Fun, Interesting Album From Kraftwerk","This is certainly Kraftwerk's most accessible and commercial-sounding album. The songs are all very dancey in a robot kind of way if you know what I mean. Fans of Kraftwerk probably understand that I am sure. ""Techno Pop"" and ""Electric Cafe"" are probably my favorite songs on the album but I really like all of the songs. This would be a good album to buy for those new to Kraftwerk who want to ease into their music."
4,"Part of a great concept, Kraftwerk","This was the latest disc I wanted buy from Kraftwerk, don't know why, perhaps thinking that being one of the latest creations of them I would be a bad. You would not be disapointed on buying this disc, it preserves all the great sound of the early Kraftwerk. All the tracks are great, my favorite is ""Music non stop"", as they explicity said someday, ""let the music speak by itself"", this track speaks about its origin and all the hard work they have done for the music, you would never be dissapointed about this group, all their discs are snazzy."
4,Not bad,"A good piece of electronic music, though a bit short for an ablum: 36 minutes or about. It is not a masterpiece of the genre, not the top achievement of Kraftwerk, but it still is nice and its tunes will make you whistle for a while."
5,It works!,Not sure what else to judge it by. It says I need to write eleven more words. These are those.
3,Good Story..poorly researched,"Having grown up during the cold war and having flown more than 3,000 hours in B-52's, I'd been searching for this book for while.The characters are shallow stereotypes.The portrayl of the B-52 crew was comical. The constant references to ""PRP"" and ""Are you EWO ready?"" are ridiculous. The ability of the crew to see fighters on their navigation radar as well as nuclear clouds was also entertaining, though far from reality.If you can set aside the poor research and the character stereotypes, the book is a good story that moves along. My expiernce in the B-52 made the book's flaws difficult to miss."
4,"Dated, but disturbing","Although the plot of the book is only passable, the real strong-point lies in the intense imagery it creates. From the glowing red radiation clouds in the serene Arctic night to the pock-marked landscape of Hawaii, Prochnau makes you see how utterly terrifying even a limited nuclear-exchange could be. In addition, he does a wonderful job of conveying the helplessness and desperation a nation would go through during such a horrific event.The book gets points off for an almost silly excuse for starting the war (although I'll certainly grant it's plausible, just seemingly very far-fetched from a 2002 perspective).Otherwise, a very exciting read."
1,save your money,"After reading Chandler Burr's ""The Emperor of Scent"" I was anticipating a great contrasting book written from the scientist's point of view. Although Luca is a brilliant scientist and showman...he is not a great author/book writer. The book was a dismal disappointment a choppy one person view monologue. The subject of how Luca turned academia on it's ear by proving the vibration theory of smell....is fascinating. The story of the perfume industry and it's rich history.....mesmerizing. Unfortunately, the tale is well told not in Luca's own book, but Chandler Burr's book ""The Emperor of Scent."""
2,Below average product. There are better alternatives,I bought this product in order to help with preventing blisters on my feet during extended runs. I applied it liberally to my feet. It did not work. My feet still sweat and there was still friction between my feet and the shoe. A product that is far superior is 2toms blister shield. That product kept me feet dry and reduced friction.
5,Shiloh,Read the book with the class and they loved the movie. They're clamoring to watch the whole set. Well worth it!
3,Im Satisfied,This phone is more than what I expected even though its used. I got what I needed and that is a phone . The phone has some downfalls like the volume is to low but you can fix that and the annoying sound that the phone makes while you are dialing is the main problem but at least it works . Most people have such high expectations on a used product expecting it to be like new if you are one of those people who isnt looking for anything technical than this is a phone for you. Im satisfied because it works so Im ok with this item so far.
3,Interesting.,"We enjoyed this movie because of the interesting story and the characters. Note: there are some shots that go to far an are not needed, parent watch first before your kids watch it."
5,Charming ensemble piece about the new South Africa,"Mark Bamford's 'Cape of Good Hope' is a small charmer about life in the new South Africa. The heart and soul of the film is Eriq Ebouaney (best known for his portrayal as Patrice Lumumba in Raoul Peck's 'Lumumba' (2000)). He plays ""Jean Claude"" here. You'll love every scene he's in. He's fabulous.I came here thinking I'd write a four-star review. But it's so maddening to see people write one- and two-star reviews because they can't get the DVD to play. How fair is that to Director Mark Bamford and his ensemble? I'm giving Bamford's very enjoyable work an additional star to combat the effects of those reviews."
2,Non-Anamorphic,"This DVD was released in non-anamorphic widescreen, a complete shame in this day and age. I'm glad this movie is finally on DVD since it wasn't shown in my area but the poor treatment it received on DVD is a crime. The features are minimal. Independent films like this should have superior DVD editions so you actually want to own them. Skip buying this and rent it instead."
1,"Didn't play in DVD Bath,UK","This DVD was purchased as present for my Mother in Bath, UK and wouldn't play in her DVD player.She was looking forward to it as she lived a lot of her life in Rhodesia."
2,Chose Carefully,"The film, Adventures Of Tartu, is a one of the best WW II British propoganda films. Robert Donet is one of the finest actors of that era. However, the video and audio transfer of the film by Alpha Home Entertainment Studio is terible. The video is dark and the audio is way out of sync (so badly it is unwatchable). I did not return the copy of that DVD because it would have cost more to return it then to keep it. I then ordered another copy of the film (from another source) manufactured by Terra Studio (which is also available from Amazon). The Terra Studios copy was of much better quality and is well worth watching. Be careful of the source. It would be nice if Amazon would post Studio specific reviews for DVDs rather then compiling multiple manufactures reviews into all like DVD titles."
2,Not up to Ritek standards,"These discs are listed as 16X compatible with my LG 4163B drive and 8X with my Plextor 712UF, but I can only get acceptable quality burns at 6X or 4X on either drive (with latest firmware installed). Some of the worst PI scans of any media I've tested (except Prodisc). I get much better results at 8X for less with Ritek 8X discs or bulk Taiyo-Yuden 4X."
3,The authors should find a different editor.,"This book contains a lot of valuable information on market strategy. The content of the book is very useful, but also very wordy and repetitive. That makes gleaning the book's ""meat"" a very frustrating task.Fortunately, core concepts are listed in page margins to summarize main ideas. There are also diagrams illustrating these core concepts. These will help you to skip past the fluffy content.I think this book shows real promise but is in serious need of copy editing."
3,Content of text is too repetitive,Book was required for an 8 week course. The way the text is written there is too much repetition and information for the course - some chapters are over 50 pages long (10-15 of those pages are used as examples and repetitive information). May be better suited to the standard semester class.
1,False Discription,"I ordered this book for my upper level business course at the university i attend and it is complete worthless to me. I needed the cases that WERE supposed to come with the book. Yet i received only the subject matter information, needless to say i wasted my money and i had to run copies off of someone elses text book. Maybe next time i will just pay the extra $60.00! At least ill know its the right book. Thanks!"
3,Great design and concept,"If you work in a clean environment this tool would probably be awesome, but if like me, you need to set the tool down in the dirt or sand occasionally, it will not last more than a couple of months."
1,I am not happy with the delivery,I didn't received the complete set .The handle was missing .The whole product is a useless without the handle.
1,all bull.,"All bull. Most. if not all of the techniques used in this book are far from amature status, and could easily kill any of it's more daring readers."
5,Timely Distopian Vision,"Often the great times of uncertainty seem to inspire something posyive as well. We saw explosions of the most enduring science fiction gems every 40 years or so around the times of great turmoil and conflict. I cannot imagine the world could have trully appreciated Verne, H.G.Wells, Orwell, Huxley, Arthur C. Clarke, or Philip Dick without the real life catastrophic events we lived and witnessed in the past 150 years. The deep distopian visions in their works resonnated with us because we saw strong moral spiritual message encoded in them.The times of great anxiety and uncertainty is here once againWe could be witnessing another golden age of great science fiction revival. Certainly this ""Dark Yergall"" promises the return to that great tradition."
3,ok.,"I got this album because I'd had a copy of it a long time ago. It's actually has some of their best songs. But, that being said, I just don't listen to it that much. I've out grown it, which is to say that it's out growable."
3,the old days of the casket,"really jazzy, great drumming. but they used to be better with their original casette demo when he screamed- still good stuff- kc rock representin'"
2,Not the best of help,"This book had fluff in it -- and then there would be some parts that showed actual writings from others - giving you ideas on how or what to write to someone. Check bookstores first - then find something and order on amazon.I didn't find the pet section very comforting - as I recently lost my 17 year old dog. I think this author needs to really be grieving before she writes anymore books - maybe even ""revise"" this book. You can find more help online free! Eulogies too! Even for your pet!"
5,Can't stop buying this bracelet,"I first purchased this for myself over a year ago and got so many compliments, I've since purchased TWO more as gifts. This is a very striking bracelet and the flat wheat links give the appearance of a Celtic woven pattern. It is my favorite silver bracelet out of the many that I own; I wear it every day. It would not be a surprise if I buy a few more as gifts this year."
4,better than its reputation,"this album has often been described by critics as haphazard and in many ways unfinished. that may or may not be the case, but check it out for yourself, there are plenty of golden gems here. i bet you a dollar or two that roger miller's ""king of the road"" will never be the same ever again to anyone who hears booker's far out version..."
2,ill try to be fair,I ordered these for my truck before seeing the light duty truck designed shocks amazon had to offer. I opened them when they arrived just to take a looksy and these things look like even on a light truck they'd snap. unless youre using a tiny clown car I wouldnt be able to trust these for suspension. The color was cool though
5,Practical Refactoring Guide with lots of examples,"Very understandable and lots of examples. This book gives you a nice hands-on toolset of how to improve the design of legacy code. It gives a nice alternative to haveing the ""perfect"" design and makes iterative programming legitimate."
2,Too obvious book,"I rate the book with two stars because the introductory part of the book brings you some good ideas and thoughts. From that point, the reference material is too simple."
4,Good resource for teaching,"What is better? Replacing delegations with inheritance or replacing inheritance with delegation?The answer is the ultimate answer to most software engineering decisions: DEPENDS, there is always a trade-off that has to be analyzed according to the context! This book addresses those trade-offs very well.Moreover, I like the examples in the book, good to use in class when teaching. They generate interesting discussions."
1,The Kindle version is broken,"The content itself is excellent -- the discussion of refactoring is absolutely great. I would give the content itself a good four or perhaps five stars.Sadly, the Kindle version is broken. The book uses example code before a refactor and after a refactor to illustrate its points, and I believe in the print version the two versions are displayed side by side. Unfortunately, in the Kindle version this side-by-side layout is destroyed, making the comparisons useless.I have read over twenty Kindle editions of books on the iPhone, iPad and my desktop, and I've never felt disappointed. Sadly, the Kindle version of ""Refactoring"" feels like a waste of money."
4,"Refactor afterwards, but design and review first","Refactoring, says Fowler in his preface, is improving the structure of the code without changing the behavior at all. His book certainly offers an organized way to do that, with examples and then an entire second half of the book which is a reference of refactoring patterns. I can recommend reading the first half of the book (methods) and then keeping it around as a reference when needed.But as a constant daily method, I think it claims too much. ""Improving the design of the code after it has been written,"" is still difficult, even if you have a book of refactoring patterns. And Fowler rightly makes having a strong unit testing suite a requirement.So I can say: read the book so that if you find yourself doing refactoring, you won't have to reinvent the wheel. But don't get your hopes up that refactoring is a substitute for good design and clear coding, as measured and improved through review by trusted co-workers."
4,An Easy Read - Lots of Great Info - Must for New Programmers,"This book is just a real easy read, with lots of good information. You can pretty much flip to any page in the book, read, and learn something. You don't have to read chapter by chapter - it's just real easy to jump into.Lots of tips seem self-evident, but I doubt they would be to rookie programmers. It's definitely a book new programmers should get their hands on early."
2,"Good ideas, bad book","Fowler's book is has a lot of very good ideas, but it is poorly written, hard to follow, and incredibly disorganized. I think it would have benefited immensely from the services of a good editor.My two major complaints: First, Fowler tries so hard to be clever and witty that at times his point is completely lost in his misguided attempts at humor. Second, he constantly refers ahead to material not yet covered, so that it's impossible to understand Chapter N without already having read Chapter N+1, which of course presupposes that you have read and understood Chapter N.If you are going to read this book (and I concede that you probably should) then you should at the same time buy a copy of Joshua Kerievsky's ""Refactoring to Patterns."" Kerievsky brings far more organization and explanation to the subject than does Fowler. Read Kerievsky first, and refer to Fowler when he directs you there (which he very frequently does). But don't try to read Fowler by himself."
5,If you buy only one OO design book...,"No kidding, this book completely changed the way I code and think about coding. OK, I'm not one of your A-list, published OO authorities, but I've been coding for a long time, and this changed everything.It's called ""Refactoring"", but along the way you see that it explicates an entire philosophy of OO design. The whole thing is presented so engagingly and with an appealing tongue-in-cheek sly wittiness that you almost read it like a novel or memoir. And what is presented is profound, fascinating and totally practical. You can apply it today.(I came here to plug the book, which I had just reopened for the thousandth time, and just decided I also ought to let y'all know that I was inspired by this to write a refactoring tool for VB6, CodeShine)."
2,50 page book expanded to over 400 pages,"The subject matter is very pertinent, but the book could have been more to the point. Some of the pages have only four lines of code; I could not understand why so much of space was left blank. Many of the techniques taught are not new and should be part of development and refactoring. It would have been nice if the authors went through each other's manuscripts and REFACTORED the book, because the book is full of repetitive material."
2,Disappointment,"It doesn't happen often that I finish a book within 2 days. This time it is because there is surprisingly little new stuff for experienced programmers. It is well written and probably of use for beginning programmers, but as I went through the refactoring patterns, I kept saying to myself: ""yes of course, I do that all the time.., where are the flashes of new insight?""."
5,Incredibly useful,"Having inherited and written code so incomprehensible it might as well be written in ancient Etruscan, I keep this book with me whenever coding. This book is probably one of the most useful books on programming in my possession. It takes an example-based approach to refactoring, and includes a well-written catalog of refactoring methods."
4,A dose of uncommon common sense,"Much of what the author says is common sense in the OO field. Having said that, it is also true that common sense is not all that common in practice. This book does do a valuable service is in assembling the catalog of refactorings and naming them. Books like this and other books on design patterns (you know them) try to make a science out of an activity (design) that is essentially an art form. That is progress."
5,Bravo,"Yeah, its a great book. As in Analysis Patterns and UML Distilled, Fowler has found an important yet neglected topic and covered it with good sense and a clear style. I look forward to his writings on extreme programming."
3,Caveat emptor,"Be warned: the examples in this book are all written in Java! As a C++ programmer I was very disappointed when I saw that (when I got the book!) IMHO, you should NOT write large applications in Java and therefore you would not need to refactor your code very often. C++ on the other hand is NOT suited for small programs (too cumbersome to just get off the ground, but THEN...) and you'd probably NEED to refactor your programs on a regular basis. The ideas in the book are good and valid, the chosen language is WRONG (IMHO)"
5,Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code,"This is a book where the title explains it all. There is no hype, no esoteric theory, no new age crystals or silver bullet tool being sold by this book. The methods explained in this book are clear, concise and immediately useful if you are a novice or a guru. I cannot even think of another book where that is true. Take your code to the next level and buy this book.p.s. The hard cover and ribbon bookmark are a very nice and classy touch for a classic book."
4,A very good book for reference or someone new to Refactoring.,"If you have a certain knowledge about refactoring, this book might not be as valuable as if you were new to the concept.However, it contains a deep enough introduction and a reference to every important refactoring methods. For each of those methods, ""pros/cons"" and ""when/when not"" are listed to help you make the right choice.Most of the examples are really simple since it is easier to write, but it is intended to be applied to complex cases.I do recommend it, unless you have over 10 years of experience in refactoring already."
5,Focused methodology; improve your code and productivity,"The concepts presented in this book are not revolutionary; they will not fill you with a sense of monomaniacal purpose. Rather this book focuses on the real issues of developing software, and describes a very simple tool for getting work done effectively. After fifteen years of developing code, I already did some of the things this book articulates; but now I do them consistently and without compromise, and my productivity has gone up while my defect rate has gone down. Subtle and quiet, perhaps, but that's powerful stuff."
5,Refactoring is a challenge,"One of my clients went through a refactoring project last year and recently this project has been revived to see if it can be incorporated with an SOA project that I am now involved with. Studying how to design services for a legacy environment while also lookint at refactoring some of the existing legacy components we have in place raised a lot of issues.I won't bore you with the details of our project but I will mention that this book was very helpful in nailing down exactly what our options to refactoring are. It focuses a lot on theory and has some insight as to where this trend is going. I learned that refactoring is *not* extending as much as it is improving what you already have.If you're interested in refactoring from a project point of view, then this is a great resource."
5,This book fills a glaring hole in the programming canon.,"There are dozens of books that will tell you how to write 'reuseable code'. This is possibly the only book around that will tell you how to reuse code and how to modify it to your needs without breaking it.Much of it is common sense (after you've had it pointed out to you) but there's still a wealth of ideas in it that are worth having around, if only so that you don't have to reinvent the wheel' again.Personally, the most valuble knowledge I gained from the book was the relatively minor bit on unit testing. The concept of writing and starting code tests before writing the code has rippled slowly through the way I work and enriched it enormously. For me the book has been worth it on that front alone.V."
3,I wish Captain Obvious didn't participate so much on this book,"Quite disappointing. Not bad, definitelly no. It's just I was expecting something more useful. If you are new to object oriented programming you won't understand most of this book YET. If you are already exeprienced object oriented programmer you will ALREADY know most of this book.Therfore, it's hard to say when you should read this book to get the best of it contents. Every day usage of modern IDEs made me refactor my code more often than I even realized, so reading most parts of this book were simply too obvious (and also sometimes explained in riddiculously complicated manners)."
4,A concept every software developer should understand,"In my humble opinion, of course, every developer should understand the concept of refactoring. And because I don't know of a better book for explaining the process and benefits of refactoring, I think every developer should read this book. As always, I did not agree with every bit of commentary, but there's nothing in there that would keep me from recommending this book."
5,Seminal Work,"The book is critical for beginner developers who want to achieve the next level. The topic is presented as ""cleaning up code"". In the process; however, it teaches how to move from bad design to good."
5,Excellent Book For Any Software Engineer,"This book changed the way I think about software development. It's a little old, but the principals still apply. The author writes in a simple way where anyone, reguardless of background can understand. The termonology the author uses is priceless and creates a way for programmers to speak to one another in an effective way. I would recommend it to any software developer, regardless of career stage or background."
1,Don't order from Herbs Pro,"They didn't let me know that this was out of stock....I kept trying to contact them and had no luck. Finally got an 800 number and hopefully got it cancelled! I won't order from them again. They did finally send me an e-mail to let me know it was out of stock, but it should have been sent way before they did it........I realize it's not Amazon's fault. I've always had good service when I've ordered from them Usually get the order in a day or two at the most."
2,stone free,the item came on time but it was not for me I have been taking in since I was told I had galstones I just wanted to start desolving them soon to avoid problums later it just gave me stomach pains I could not take anymore. other people said it worked for them and Im glad for them I just was not one of them so I will search elswhere
5,"great service, product exactly as described",I was surprised and happy to get this package immediately after ordering. The product is exactly what was described and so much easier than chasing all over town trying to find it in stock locally. Thank you SO much for offering this product!
3,Come Up Short For Greatness!,"Ashford & Simpson is perhaps one of the best kept secrets in the R & B-Soul category. Too bad there aren't enough great Hits on the C.D. to give it a worth-well reason to promote it better. Don't get me wrong, I love Soul, R&B, but there's only one song on the album I remember. And that's 'Solid', great song. I think the problem with notoriety is the lack of playing time by all non-soul Radio Stations."
3,The wit is not exactly rapier-like,"You may be put off by the narrator's laddish humour, by his preoccupation with dog-[...] and other excreta, by his rampant libido, his frequent references to boobs, buttocks and genitals, underwear and the lack of it, by his contortions in speaking French and French contortions in speaking English; but you would still get some aperus on aspects of life among the French: their propensity to go on strike, their mannerisms, their food, how the French mark April Fool's Day, their attitude to the Iraq War, sleazy politicians, etc. However, some of the things he describes are, in my view, not sufficiently different from life among the English to justify him making quite the meal of them that he does. I see that Clarke has previously written jokes for stand-up comedians. It figures."
1,Preoccupied with Sex,"This book must have been written for other men because as a woman, I was not particularly entertained by the author's preoccupation with his sexual conquests and prowess. I expected more interesting insights and experiences about the cultural adaptation of an Englishman to living in Paris, but instead was bored by his immature and adolescent thoughts and behaviors with French women, which we hear about in excessive detail. I don't think I'll be paying for future books about his adventures. I've already got the message and it isn't what I was hoping for."
3,Not what I expected. It's fiction not autobiographical.,"Though the book was funny at times, it wasn't what I expected. It is a work of fiction. I don't read fictional texts about places I want to visit. Also, it was geared toward 20-something audience."
4,Entertaining read,"As an amateur writer who also focuses on other cultures, I was interested to see how Paul handled the task. This was done perfectly - maybe because it was marked as 'almost true' - which meant Paul could exaggerate a little and create a well rounded story that felt complete at the end. Some of the other stories I've read about other cultures have either been too dry or too self-righteous. But I really enjoyed Paul's English style. Definitely recommend."
2,a disappointing read,"Having lived in Paris for five years, I bought this book on an English friend's advice. The author's observations on life in Paris are occasionally funny, but narrow-minded. It seems that French men are universally suspect, while French women are just sex objects. The author's writing about his endless string of and there are a number of funny observations. Still, the jokey writing hints of Clive James on speed, which gets a bit tiring after awhile."
2,Not What I Thought,"After seeing the glowing reviews, and getting a recommendation from one of my online sites, I bought the book. If you liked A Year In Provence (smartly written, wry humor), you probably won't like this book. The main character is cocky and arrogant, and everything (esp women)just seem to fall effortlessly into his lap. A slow read, and not very engaging. Some useful tips on the french, but not worth reading the entire book just to get them."
2,Not So Good,"Funny moments but the book just fell apart by the end. I got tired of reading about the amoral French and wondered what on earth was up with a man that was so apparently sex-addled that he was willing to take up with some of the most reprehensible women for a roll in the hay. And at the end of the book I wondered why someone who could barely speak French, understood only too well the iron grip the unions have on every facet of life and their willingness to strike at any moment for no practical reason, the corruption of the French bureaucracy and the difficulty of living in Paris decided to live there and start a business!"
3,A little tedious after a while,I guess I didn't get it. Parts were funny then it got a little tedious. Read it if you think you'll get it.
3,Frat boy meets Bridget Jones,"As an American living in Paris, I'm always interested in finding interesting tales about the French. One has to keep one's sense of humor about living here, after all. I found this book in an English bookstore in Amsterdam, and had high hopes for it - A year in the s**t, how could it be bad?It's much more non-fiction than humorous anecdotes about the French, although it does have its moments. I've decided that if frat boys wrote chic lit about living in Paris, this would be the result - kind of fluffy, lots of sex, not much substance but a good short read. He's right on a lot of his observations, but the story is much more about the author's alter-ego's life, which just happens to take place in Paris."
1,It Felt Longer...,"Oone of the worst books I've started reading in quite a while. I didn't finish. How did this become a best seller? He shouts ""look at how funny I am"" and he's not. He shouts ""look how strange and/or incompetent and/or incomprehensible the French are"" without convincing me -- he's just another slagging Brit whingeing Pom. He also brags about all the girls he shags, and I don't care. It is, to go for the obvious here, merde."
2,Sexist and Only Occasionally Funny,"I purchased this book while living in France thinking I could relate to the author. It was an easy read that had a few funny parts, but I was completely turned off by the unrelenting sexism of the protagonist. If I wasn't desperate for reading material, his blatantly sexist comments would have made me quit reading in disgust after only the first few pages. If you're not offended by such garbage, or you're a misogynist yourself, you may enjoy this book, otherwise - stay away."
2,Doesn't venture beyond traditional stereotypes,"I don't recommend this book for readers with any significant exposure to French culture and history.I was intrigued by the title of the book and a report by a friend of mine who flipped through this book at the bookshop. I picked it up based on her suggestion and some online reviews. I didn't make it through the fourth chapter. The book trades in low-level comedy surrounding basic differences and stereotypes etc: fashion and style, work hours, kissing, etc. I suppose I was looking for more sophisticated comedy surrounding real differences like fatalism and grand projects etc. I just couldn't get into it - too much cringing."
4,Tips to survive in France,"I'm now workin in France and I bought this book and the other one ""talk to the snail"", A year in the merde gave me a overview of how's the life in France through the eyes of Brit. When I start to work in France now, everytime when I have the conversations with French no matter at work or daily life, I will remember some pieces of stories in this book and it make me smile. Recommended this...if you want to have a better understanding of French people and the life in France."
4,A Brit in Paris,"A whimsical book on a Brit living in Paris. There are three themes in this story. The satire of an Englishman adjusting to Parisian life with a country house thrown in, his amorous adventures with libidinous young women, and an intrigue of sordid business and political deals.The first one - the satire worked well and kept me reading. There are equally amusing observations on French and British life. The other two areas - the amorous encounters and the intrigue were less successful and seemed there merely to decorate the Parisian observations with soft-core flirtations and a business espionage that didn't make much sense to me.I love Paris and France so that part of the travelogue worked. To emphasize - this book is a travel brochure with titillation and intrigue tossed into the salad but not enhancing the taste."
1,Terrible,One of the worst books I have ever read. Poorly written and seems to revolve around the author's persona just acting like a dick for most of the book. Awful.
3,Trop de protest,"Clarke's character is supposed to be naive but comes across as an uneducated, whining complainer. Clarke, on the other hand, is a mean-spirited observer: he gets the details right but assigns malevolent motives. As a result, his novel lurches unconvincingly through half a dozen unpleasant episodes, during which his ""hero"" learns nothing more useful than how to order a cup of coffee. And how to avoid stepping in doggy-doo. In the ""best"" tradition of Peter Mayle-style travel writing: treating the subject like amusing animals in the zoo. Not funny."
3,"Not much to it, but still fun","This is a pretty standard western, with some interesting color, name dropping of famous gunslingers, and not much else. There is little character development, the plot meanders, and it all seems to tie into a series of mysteries that barely resolve by the time the novel is over. However, the writing is clean, the occasional gunfights are brisk, and descriptions of the poker games are surprisingly fun.I don't know if this is true in his other novels, but the whole book is written in short sections of one to three pages, making is a quick read. The Gamblers is an enjoyable way to pass a few minutes here and there. Certainly not great, but I'll probably pick up the sequel if I find it."
3,It serves the purpose,I purchase Human Capital as part of a classroom project. The book is in good shape but it had a lot of written notes in it. It will meet the purpose I need since I will only take a few notes from it and then put it on the bookshelf.
5,"easy installation,great price","These refills couldn't be found at any local auto parts places without buying the whole blade.Great price,easily installed,works as good as original"
4,Ratings a little odd....,"This is a great resource if you live in the area, but some of the ratings are something beyond merely opiniated. For instance, living in Florence we eat at the Miss Florence Diner fairly often. It is a neat old diner, but it serves basically old diner food and as the authors note, even things as basic as a chesseburger and fries can be rather disappointing. Yet they give the food a higher ranking then several very good (though perhaps over rated) restaurants in Northampton, like Circa, Green Street Cafe and Mulino's. This is not a big deal, but did strick me as a little bizarre.On the other hand, their assessment the India Palace restaurant serves as good food as the over rated India House is right on the mark.If you eat out often in the five college area, this book is a must-have."
1,Smells awful!,"The smell of this product is not very nice at all - smells like a mixture of orange juice, milk and plastic. I haven't been able to use it much because it makes me nauseous. Consistency wise - it's fairly thick & I didn't find that it lathered very easily as a body wash. This product has been relegated to the 'use as a foot wash so we can get rid of it quickly' basket."
3,I wish the smell lingered longer than the shower,"I love Philosophy's products and the fact that it's a 3 in 1 product: shower gel, shampoo and bubble bath.I have used this as a shower gel and shampoo. The shower gel, to me, seems like it takes more to suds up. The shampoo makes my hair nice and soft.However the smell of the raspberry in it doesn't last long. Only in the time you wash and rinse off."
3,Smells good,"Has a nice vanilla-y smell, but it is very short lasting. It does have a wonderful lather, especially with a loofah, and a little goes a long way."
2,smells like bananas,"I like the philosophy line, but the Vanilla Birthday Cake body wash doesn't smell so much like birthday cake as it does bananas.The product is great though."
3,No smell,"I love philosophy,but this one has very little smell to it,which is one of the reasons I buy it. Sorry but this one is my least favorite."
2,really disappointed,I was extremely disappointed with this product it smells like dawn dish soap it dries the skin out something terrible
4,Citrus with a zip,"The best way to describe this scent is citrus with a zip to it. Refreshing and nourishing, this is a great shower gel for anyone like me that has sensitive skin. I love Philosophy shower gels and this is no exception."
1,Sadly disappointed,"I ordered this expecting a luxurious, fragrant product and ended up with a soap smelling product that I could have picked up at a discount store. It looks pretty, but has NO fragrance of raspberry and lathers poorly. I will probably never purchase another philosophy shampoo because this was such a disappointment!"
3,Where's the vanilla?,"I love anything vanilla scented and I'm also crazy about Philosophy products. I'm sorry, but this shower gel missed the mark. I can smell a slight hint of vanilla when I sniff from the bottle, but once I use it in the shower I smell NOTHING! I gave this product three stars for lathering well and making my skin soft, but there's no scent. I wish Philosophy would sell the Eggnog all year. Now that's a scent that you can smell!"
2,Smelt this at the local store and.....,"I was not impressed. While not as bad as say the Mint Chocolate Chip Ice Cream, it is not great. I did not feel it was worth the price tag. I am glad that I got to smell this line before buying it.I wanted to love this line so badly. Nice price point with wonderful foody scents. The quality of the scent is just not there. If you are used to other smaller companies you may not be happy with this product. If you are used to other mass market companies you will be ok. I buy more often from small etailers who hand make their soap. A much pricier product over all.I do think this would make a fun gift for your teen or pre-teen who just loves smelling like cake. It is a nice upgraded product for someone used to the mall bath stores or lesser products. It is just not for the scenty soap addicted person thinks this soap is a cheap price point perhaps."
2,Somewhat disappointed,"I was so intrigued by being able to shower and come out smelling like a cupcake, but was disappointed. Don't get me wrong, this does smell good and feels soft going on your skin. However, the scent is nothing like a cupcake, more like a cheap vanilla.I'd recommend trying another scent or buy a cheaper vanilla if that's what you're going for.Sephora is great as always with prompt shipping and nice packaging."
2,Thought it would be Vanilla Heaven,"I love these products...for what it is, I use it as a shower gel and the lather is great, doesn't dry me out. But I was excited for a Vanilla Cupcake sented experience... I was dissapointed. I would recommend the other products, the fruity ones, ice cream ones, Key Lime pie for sure..I would not buy this again for the smell."
1,Disappointed? Try Perlier!,"If you're disappointed because this product doesn't smell like a vanilla cupcake, try Perlier Vanilla Cream Bath. It's made with REAL vanilla beans and smells EXACTLY like vanilla cake mix."
1,Disappointing to the last drop...,"I would strongly recommend no one buy this product...as many other reviewers said it smells nothing, absolutely nothing like a vanilla birthday cake, or any cake for that matter. I am very likely not to try any more of their products. There is only 1 3-1 that I would recommend, the Double Dutch Chocolate (I think that's the name, it is sold here at the Amazon site. I even wrote to complain and was told that they only return ""gently used"" products, what a rip-off (I want to use a more eloquent term, but rip-off is what it is). If I could rate this at less than one star I would."
1,Not so yummy...,"I put up a review of the stuff several weeks ago and its mysteriously disappeared, so I'm going to re-review it.Soo, this stuff? Does not smell good. Sort of like Tang with an undertone of vomit. The Gracefall and chocolate-scented wash is the way to go. Not the orange Gatorade body wash, which is what this smells like."
1,Read carefully,"I use the Philosophy 3-in-1 WITH CONDITIONER. It works great and keeps my hair luscious. The one time I accidentally bought a 3-in-1 that didn't have conditioner in it, my hair dried out after two washes and got horrible split ends. After only three applications I had to throw the bottle out. I lost more than an inch off the bottom of my hair. I don't understand how their products can vary so widely in quality, but they do."
4,Did what I wanted,"Didn't fit my screen perfectly, but works well enough. Nice are preventing reflection and eye-strain."
1,Not the best for an outside TV,I replaced the TV under the roof of my covered patio. The old TV had a matte screen the new one a 20 inch flat CRT has a glossy finish. Of course the glare is now much worse than with the matte CRT screen. I searched for glare filters and would up with a EX10XXL. To my surprise the filter has a high gloss finish. Little to no glare reduction in this application. There is a slight increase in contrast. Overall not worth buying.
2,"2003 Deluxe, Flawed program.","I upgraded from Card Studio Deluxe to 2003 Deluxe for the address book. I do alot of mail merge but when you print lables or envelopes it prints the last name twice instead of Mr. & Mrs. (last name). Going to Sierra support I found many people with the same problem. Sierra says there is no fix and is refunding my money. There are also less options for lable sizes and, when printing envelopes, it prints in the same place no matter how you put the settings. Also, I cannot cut or delete the Hallmark graphics on the back of the cards.I'm very dissapointed with this product and Hallmark for selling this program with a known flaw and no patch."
4,"This is a nice, simple change from more involved programs","I use several different home publishing programs. Some of them you want to use whenever you are striving for something involved and creative;some of them you choose to create a quick and lovely personal greeting. This program falls into that category. It has some lovely artwork, some beautiful messages and offers more creativity than the previous versions of the same program. Buy it. You will like it."
2,Disappointed,Hallmark thought they had improved this product - but they didn't - I own 3 Hallmark Card Studio's and this one is the worst - there are so many things I could do with Hallmark Card Studio 3 Delux that I can't do with this one. I am very disappointed.
1,I bought it & wish I hadn't!,"I have the Hallmark Greetings 2000, put out by Microsoft, & have enjoyed using it, so I purchased this newer version, thinking it would be even better than the old version. WRONG! This newer version is put out by Sierra, & they usually put out quality software. But, I soon found that I had much more flexibility with the older version than with this one, & I had more choices with making personal variations (resizing the card or artwork on it; adding my own clip art on the card; & saving the cards to my desktop folder.) The newer version seems clumsier & creating a customized greeting card with this newer software is more frustrating, too. Don't waste your money."
1,HALLMARK/SIERRA SUCKS,"Granted, I've had this HALLMARK/Sierra CARD STUDIO 2003 loaded on my PC for a few years, HOWEVER when I went to reinstall the Studio the program now hangs on ""setup"" and the MS InstallShield(R) Wizard never starts. The ""Events Calendar"" loads but not the Card Studio. Why should I have to buy Hallmark's 2009 Studio when the 2003 was doing what I needed? HALLMARK SELLS UNSUPPORTED GARBAGE. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS CARD STUDIO."
3,Photo Editing Features Missing,"Box cover and Amazon description tell you ""New Integrated Photo Editing Features"" however they are not there. Otherwise the cards are great and a good selection."
2,Haven't even used it yet and I'm confused!!!,"I just opened the Hallmark Card Studio Deluxe and I'm confused because the CD case has slots for 4 CD's, but there were only 3 inside. Upon looking EVERYWHERE - on the box, in the manual, on the case - I could NOT find how many CD's should be included! What if I'm in the middle of creating and it asks for CD #4? I'll be out of luck and won't be able to return it. Also, I'm disappointed with the ""Hallmark Paper Pack""-- It's just a small amount of blank cards, and not even ones that are that attractive. I expected a sampling of stickers, certificates and paper. So far, I'm really disappointed."
4,Great new Card Studio!,"I enjoyed Card Studio 3, but Hallmark Card Studio 2003 has really impressed me. It's very easy to find what you want, there are lots of occasions from which to choose, and you can personalize and print a card in just a few minutes. A great way to create special cards for family and friends."
2,So so software,"I bought this software thinking I could do so much with it, but I can't. I wanted to make a card for a 30th birthday party I was attending and it had every milestone but the 30th. I tried to change the number from one card and it's not possible. I also tried to make labels for envelopes but you can only make labels using Hallmark brand labels. I'm looking for something a litte more flexible."
1,Disappointed,If you already had Hallmark Card Studio 2...you do not need the 2003 version...not much has been added. PLUS you cannot get rid of the icons on the back of your card that you want to create.I thought I was doing something wrong and wrote to the help division. The 2003 version has permanent icons. You cannot create your own card. No more Hallmark for me!
3,Hallmark Card Studio 2003 Deluxe,"I can not remove event planner to revise it. The event planner does not show coming events ahead so I can check my schedules. I have asked four times for help, but nothing works."
1,Disappointed Shopper,I have just purchased Hallmark Card Studio and I am not impressed with it. I originally ordered the Hallmark Delux one and was sent what I think very basic package. I would still like to purchase the original order.
2,Hallmark Card Studio Deluxe 2003,"I was expecting an availibity of calendars, cards that you could insert your own pictures in... I haven't found any of that. I think it's a cheap replication of Microsoft's ""Greeting"" production that I wish I had bought."

1,Has she ever been in a coven?,"I'm always amazed when solitaries say this is the great book on covenkeeping.I was stunned to find out an untidy house made a bad priestess, or that the number of books in a house means a person is unstudied. (To me it means they are merely victims of book snatchers, like ever priest I know!.One wonders where Amber's covens are...."
5,It has everything!,"Amber K's 500 page book is loaded with information related to finding a coven, founding a coven, and making sure you know what you want from a coven before you begin the process. It has numerous examples of how to implement the suggestions outlined in the chapters. . Covencraft includes chapters on finances, offices, new members, ritual, the sabbats & esbats, training & initiation, group dynamics, counseling, elders, traditions, and networking. This book is a must for any High Priest/ess, and strongly recommended for anyone interested in joining a coven."
5,Wonderful information-rich book!,"This has got to be the best book put out by Llewellyn in years. It offers ideas for group activities, working with group dynamics, holding open rituals, finding new members (and deciding if it's time to find new members), holding a ""Wicca 101"" class, I could go on and on. I haven't been so glad I bought a book in quite awhile."
4,Some People Aren't Meant To Be Set Free,"Sonic Youth fans are a fickel bunch. Many get it and more than not, many others simply do not get it."
2,Not worth the paper it's written on!,"If it took John Baxter 3 years to write this book, then he spent the first 2 years, 364 days, 11 hours, and 55 minutes doing something else. This book didn't tell me anything I didn't already know about cleaning windows."
3,A good read,"This somewhat historical novel is a unique blend of bringing together Wyatt Earp, the son of Doc. Holliday and also Bat Masterson with Al Capone. Just this should be enough to intrigue you and get you interested in the book. It is an interesting read and the characters are sketched out very well.J. Robert Ewbank, author ""John Wesley, Natural Man, and the 'Isms'"""
3,"Good idea, poorly rendered",I love the idea of bringing an older Wyatt Earp to New York to face off against a young Al Capone. The novel starts off well too getting the old boy to the big city but it loses its way with some stilted and predictable writing. Too bad. It was fun till then.
2,"Started out great, then...................",I thought that the premise of the story was rather imaginative. I'm a big fan of historical fiction especially when the author weaves historical figures into the story alongside fictional characters. The plot moved along very quickly and the development of the characters was good as well. As I was making my way through the book I kept asking myself how the author would end the story I knew (as do many of us) that Capone eventually leaves NY to settle in Chicago but how would the author accomplish this within the context of his story? I thought the ending was just a bit too far fetched. The author wrapped it up in a nice neat package. Who wants that? I guess the author was limited to what he could do to most of the main characters if he wanted to keep it in line with reality. Still it was a huge letdown.
4,liked it.....did'nt love it,"let me start by saying Lee Morgan is my favorite trumpet player.His in your face, fearless playing is what drew me to him. after reading all the reviews of this cd i bought it.Maybe i expected too much, it was just a tad subdued for my taste i guess.still a very good cd but i can't put it in my top five Lee Morgan cd's"
4,more straightforward than its reputation,"Lee Morgan had a hit with ""The Sidewinder"", and then tried to recreate the success of that song with a bunch of funky tunes. Before ""The Sidewinder"" came out, Lee recorded ""Search For A New Land"". This CD thus has the reputation of being untainted by his soon-to-come commercial success. The title track is the most notable song. It's long, and has a more progressive song structure than the typical theme-solo-theme structure. It's a good song, and you can hear Lee stretching his legs in a salutory fashion. Lee chose a great group of sidemen: Wayne Shorter, Grant Green, Herbie Hancock, Reggie Workman, and Billy Higgins. The rest of the album is more like tracks 2-5 from ""The Sidewinder"" -- standard Lee Morgan. Of course, that's hardly a criticism, the remainder of the CD is very good. Very good!"
5,Great Product to Raise Seat Height!,"This elevated seat riser is wonderful. It installs fine if you put the washers on the bottom side of the commode. As long as the washers are placed correctly the seat works perfectly. See the post from Oct. 20, 2012 for instructions. This review solved my problem with installation. The seat is much more secure since it is bolted in rather than placed on top of the commode seat. Thanks Amazon for selling this product!"
2,Didn't like this product,"The many layers of plastic in the hinged seat, cover and existing toilet cover made cleaning a nightmare. Too many layers and one would have to be either very dirty or a slave to the commode to keep it clean. Also, the raised toilet seat was so high that my feet would not reach the floor."
5,"Easy to install, wife really likes it",This elevated toilet seat fits between the actual toilet seat and the rim of the bowl. Both the toilet seat and the elevating spacer can be lifted easily. It was easy to install. This product helps my spouse get on and off the toilet more easily.
4,A minor problem installing,The product allowed me not to have to purchase a new raised toilet. It is much better than the raised seat we purchasd from the orthopedic supply store. The only problem was that I was not able to use the existing American Standard seat that was on the existing toilet. However I was able to switch seats with another bathroom in the house.
5,1-Piece Toilet,"This product is mainly intended for 2-piece toilet but it still works for 1-piece toilet. I have to purchase 2 machines screws(4"" long x 1/4"" x 20)for my Koehler i-piece Rialto toilet. It looks good and I am sure it will help my mother-in-law who fell down recently and had a compression fracture. It almost look like a normal toilet seat."
3,hinged toliet seat,"It is ok, I have trouble keeping the wing nuts tight. Constantly having to re-tighten. I like the hinged part so my Grandchildren can raise the lid instead of removing it completely."
2,Comfortable?,This is a good item for the average user. If your a bit overweight you might want to pass on this one
4,My hips feel so much better,"After two total hip replacements, my doctor restricted my movement to not bending my hips farther than 90. Two years later I thought I was healed and fine until we moved to a new home that had very low toilet seats. I had to struggled to get up, and I'm only 5'4"" tall. Within a week I was in pain and using a walker. It was awful. Then my husband installed these. 4 days later I started using that walker less and less, and after a month I. Not using it at all. What a difference! I took off one star because they don't come in any color except white, and our toilets are tan so these risers really show up and look strange. Still I highly recommend them for anyone who has had hip replacements."
2,"Long on ideology, light on substance","Although Foreman outlines the ideological basis of the environmnetal justice movement quite thoroughly, he fails to provide an adequate examination of how the movement is supposed to function in the real world. He examines the problems that the EJ movement faces in translating its ideological beliefs into real world actions, but Foreman does not present a substantive explanation for how it could be more effective in affecting the changes it desires. Overall, a fairly boring read."
4,"A good start in studying this genre, but needs to go deeper.","Darius James' ""That's Blaxploitation!"" gives a decent account of the genre of American film that dominated the Black Box-Office in the 1970's; however, it doesn't reach the depths of what caused the rise of such films. It's humor is raw and raucus, but his obvious personal biases get in the way."
5,Hart warming Performance ..Excellent Portrayal of life.,"This 1870's Epic of the American Frontier, was excellently scripted and well directed not to mention the superlative performances This heart warming tale of two people from two different worlds,Loosing almost all that is Near and Dear to them, fall in love, a different yet realistic twist in dealing with RUNAWAY PASSIONS OF THE HEART. Pato Hoffman's Performance cemented this classic into my video library."
4,One of My Favorite Movies,Pato Hoffman indeed made this movie. His portrayal shows his years of acting training truly paid off. The movie portrays a good story and a believable one. I think all who acted in the film did a great job!
4,Good movie,I watched the movie with my wife & and we both enjoyed it. Good plot & good acting by the cast.
3,"This movie is good. And by good, I mean sucks.","I give it 3 stars because of the amount of times it made us laugh out loud. This is some of the worst direction, production and writing in the history of, well, history. I've seen soft-core porn with a better storyline.Best thing about this movie? It's billed as having Ice T and Coolio as the stars...they're both dead within the first 3 minutes of the film. I'm sorry....did I just call this failure a film? I meant movie.Don't watch this alone. It'll make you feel icky. It's meant for a rainy saturday afternoon, with a good friend and a good bottle.I have to get back to this disaster now...beware...this movie is the reason that other cultures hate us."
3,Extra Features need some work,I agree with previous comments re. picture quality. I disagree w/ comments on the remote. It is overly complicated which is even more complicated in low light since it is not back lit. TV Guide feature needs to be easier to use - it is a helpful feature though if you use a Cable Card. It is very nice to be free of the cable box! The reason I gave 3 stars is that a product at this premium price should be perfect.
5,"text with humour, breath-taking voice, sung by a real beauty","The texts are filled with humour but bear a message. Her voice is filled with breath-taking sensuality. She is a real beauty. Exactly the same can be said about Lauryn Hill (Everything is Everything), Jennifer Lopez, Madonna (Beautiful Stranger)and many others."
3,Good Book,"I enjoyed the first book of this series a lot, and was excited to read the second one. However, I think this book isn't as good as the first. Sophie still has problems, and is trying to work her way through that tough age between childhood and adulthood. Her father still doesn't understand her. It is their relationship that interests me the most in Nancy Rue's books about Sophie. And we, the readers, finally find out the reason why her father is so hard on her.It may be because I'm so far past the age group this book is aimed at, but I felt the answer was too easy. That relationships between father and daughter can be complicated just because they are two different people. I didn't need a cause as much as a resolution to try to understand each other.I would still recommend this book. Nancy Rue creates great characters and gives them real problems."
3,Clean calibrations,"3 1/2GK sound of a post-Crimson instrumental act, but substitute some overall tension for an electro-tribal influence of steadiness."
5,Beautiful Book,This is a really beautiful book that intertwines scripture with glorious artistry to tell the story of the birth of Jesus.
5,Beautiful Paintings accompany the story of Christ's birth from the Bible,I collect Christmas books and this is one of my favorites. The illustrations are beautiful paintings that depict the story of the birth of Jesus Christ. The paintings are accompanied by scripture. A lovely book for any collection.
1,Inaccurate & Unorganized,"On page 10, a fundamental formula is incorrect.(60 + 60) / (60 * 60) does not equal 30.Why does and electrical book have a chapter on Coolant systems discussing pressure released radiator caps? The end of coolant chapter introduces you to electrical testing tools.The author claims this organization was ""by design"" -- quite a poor design. This book has more problems than a calculus book."
1,Automotive Electrical Systems Troubleshooting and repair basics,"Consider the book to be very confusing, as within the first ten pages found three significant mistakes. Only glanced throught the remaining sections because didn't want to get more confused or misled. Appears to be very poorly edited or proof read. Would not recommend it for a serious information source, unless you are already knowledgeable."
5,In search of the self through the eyes of a roach,"With her exquisit sense of integrity and fear of putting the reader in trouble because of her deep search of the self, the author begs the reader not to leave her alone while developing one of the most beautiful (sometimes painful) vision of life itself. La Lispector takes a deep breath and with courage, develops an intriguing story, where through the eyes of a cockroach, she is able to feel, taste and experience her (our) ""Human Condition"". She grabs our hands, with some kind of despair, but promisses not to let anything do us harm until the story is over. At the end, swetting hands, a sense of relief and the strange feeling that something has changed. (Rubens Barbosa"
2,Avoid,"This CD was squashed with a compressor by, I presume, the mastering engineer to the point that I find the first four tracks and some of the subsequent live tracks (e.g. The End) practically unlistenable. Avoid this release if you care about good sound."
5,These guys are soooooo wonderful!,"If you love soul music you won't be disappointed. Ry Cooder finds the BEST musicians and these two were made for each other. PERFECT! (don't miss their 'Live and Let Live' CD - as good as this one is, that one's even better! Love them both!!)"
4,"good, well thought out sci-fi","This is a very good story. The plot has been used many times and will be used many more times.Here is the plot: a lifeboat (spaceship) departs a ship (earth) hoping to get to a better place, the lifeboat breaks down and they stop at a desert island (a planet) for repairs and then continue on, leaving behind some of the passengers.Using the passengers progeny as slaves with a resulting conflict was a neat idea."
2,Not real good,Niven writes in the prolog that he doesn't usually work with new authors. This book is a great example why he shouldn't break that rule.
4,"Grand story, History that might yet be","For a novel with a grand vision of what a slice of the fate of humanity might be, it succeeds quite well. Far from being some wrote stage play of archetypes, it takes a scientific scenario of a marooned interstellar expedition, and explores how that situation might play out.I have never read any science fiction story like it, and it shows some serious thought as to how technology, humanity, artificial intelligence, and the uncaring nature of universal physics might play out in some far-flung future. I think it is the constant presence and interplay of human nature that sets this novel apart from a solo Larry Niven effort, offering non-sci-fi twists to the plot, and yet it has a great amount of tech play too. A good change of pace that I thoroughly enjoyed."
2,This is not a typical Larry Niven book :(,"Let me start by saying I think Larry Niven is one of the greatest science fiction writers out there.He is my Pantheon next to Asimov, Heinlein, Clarke, Zelazny and co.If you are looking for a Known Space book, this is not it.If you are looking for a hard science fiction book, this is not it.The story is not convincing, not the plot nor the characters.There is no riddle, no twist, no exploring like I'm so used to find in Larry Niven books.I want a refund.BTW, before reading this book I've read ""The Draco Tavern"". I've read in the past most of the stories in the book (it's a collection), but it was a joy reading it. And now I've started reading ""Fleet of Worlds"". I'm only on page 24 and from here I'm going right back to reading it."
2,Too juvenile for my taste,"I was really disappointed in this book. I've read just about everything that Niven has written or collaborated on, and this book just didn't match his usual standard. The book clearly focused on pulling the particular stings of the young reader. Sometimes this works even for adults, when you know it up front, but I don't think it worked this time.Apparently Cooper wrote the vast majority of the text. I just couldn't relate to the main character. For the first time ever (for a Niven book) after reading over half the book, found I just wasn't that interested in her or the story, and just skipped to the end."
3,"Too much gardening, not enough character development.","Plowing (pun intended) through the gardening in the first third of the book was tedious. I can identify cacti, don't be giving me gruesome details on trees and flowers and fertilizer.I'm a major Niven fan, but this was just dull, dull, dull at first.Then, we have characters introduced in the last half of the book that just kind of pop in and out. No real character development or background (Shane and Star just come and go?), but at least the gardening gets left behind, pretty mu(l)ch.Some short sections of the book were really good, but I'm not sure they outweighted the gardening part.Not enough Niven and I think Brenda needs some more practice."
1,Very disappointing,"Very disappointing, I've been a long time fan of Niven but even confined to a hospital bed I was only able to get through 2/3 of the way through."
1,Torture,I gave up reading it 50 pages from the end and won't pick it up again. It is just too difficult and boring to read.
1,Hack job,"Thankfully, I got my copy from the library.Like several other reviewers, I only got partway into this before I realized it was going nowhere: an implausible concept, badly executed.This is yet another example of an established, accomplished writer lending his name to the work of somebody who could not possibly market this stuff on their own. We see a lot of this now, as the great science fiction authors get on in years and no longer generate memorable original material as they did in their earlier days. For those hoping for an unforgettable reading experience to rival Niven's ""Ringworld"" or the ""Tales of Known Space"" universe, there's nothing here.Dual-author science fiction should be a red flag: ""Warning! Hack material inside!"" And to think, just a few decades ago, Niven and Pournelle actually had a great collaborative corpus."
2,Not Your Usual Niven SciFi,Usually I can't put a Niven book down. This one was hard to pick up. Very slow going.
2,"Some good, Mostly bad","I've always loved Niven, and the parts I could clearly see he wrote in this book I enjoyed. The concept, definitely Niven. The character Gabriel, also, definitely Niven. Most of the rest of the book feels like some poorly written adolescent coming-of-age tale set inside the fairly cool concept designed by Niven.Maybe its just me, but this book seems like a favor that Larry Niven did for Brenda Cooper. I'm all for giving a fellow writer a leg up or collaborating with a peer to produce a more well-rounded book, but in this case it wasn't a peer.If you're a Niven fan, pass this one by. I read the last page, tossed the book on the coffee table and thought about all the other things I could have been doing or other books I could have been reading while I wasted my time on this.Note to Larry: Give Jerry a call, you guys are great together. Never take Brenda's calls ever again. She's sci-fi poison."
1,Oh my gosh this is terrible,I can't even work up the energy to write a properly comprehensive review. This reads like it was written by a talented 14 year old. Don't waste your time. Niven obviously had little to do with this.
2,Not very impressive,"First of all: This is not a Larry Niven book. The book is written by Brenda Cooper, with Niven as a mentor.This was a very plain (in the negative sense) book. As some other reviewer said, it seems like it written by an adolescent.The book has several parallels to ""Burning the Ice"" by Laura Mixon, but is in no way as captivating and fullfilling."
4,Surprisingly good novel of humanity's far future.,"I was surprised when I logged on and saw reviewers that said this novel was too tough to get through, as I found it a refreshing tale that actually has both solid writing and innovative ideas. The Earth backstory may have been a bit generic and weak but the tale of terraforming Selene (Harlequin's Moon) was fascinating, and the life story of Rachel Vanowen showed the authors' ability to create well rounded and interesting characters. This is a far future novel of interplanetary travel and colonization that is one of the best science fiction books of 2005. Highly Recommended."
2,The book really doesn't go anywhere...,"The first 200-250 pages aren't bad, but then the book takes a turn and you wonder where it is going... No where. I was holding on through the first 200 pages, then I just saw it was going nowhere and sadly I was right it didn't go anywhere. I finished the book confused and empty handed. Niven's style isn't apparent in this book, and I wonder who this newcomer Cooper is. The hard SF in this book also isn't well supported and the characters don't develop as they should. I'm surprised I finished the book..."
5,wonderful,This is such an amazing collection of works. I had to read this in a college english class at WVU and somehow misplaced it. I enjoyed it so much that I needed to buy another copy. Anyone who has any sense of reading good literature should read this book.
2,Cry for the loss,"Wow, if you have read previous ten reviews you'll think that Mr. Pancake was the embodiment of Faulkner, Tennessee Williams and Malmud. It is truly unfortunate that he killed himself in 1979. If he had lived, today he might be one of America's great short story writers. His writing style is measured and sparse. It is as if he had not looked to expand his writer's pallet of possibilities.Pancake's is a story worth knowing for its sense of profound loss not its sense of contribution. His stories of West Virginia draw you in and leave you with a satisfaction of understanding the protagonists and their situations. But, there are no deep messages. The deep messages were still in the heart and brain that were stopped by a self inflected shotgun blast. Cry for the loss. There is not a volume of work to celebrate."
5,Handbag Chic,"HANDBAG CHIC is a wonderful book! It is very informative with many high quality purses ranging from a rare, early Theorem purse to beautiful 20th century needle worked and leather examples. The circa 1840 painted straw purse had me green with envy. The cover is imaginatively designed as a purse, complete with a chain handle on the spine! The photography is of a very high quality, making details easy to see. I consider this a great addition to my collection of books on purses and a must have for purse and couture collectors everywhere."
2,$50 is alot to spend on a nice cover.,"As an owner of over 100 handbags, I was very disappointed with this book. Despite its' beautiful cover, most of the bags are very ordinary and many of the most important handbag designers of the last 200 years are overlooked."
4,Handbag Chic: 200 Years of Designer Fashion (Schiffer Book for Collectors with Price Guide,Shipment was a little later than expected but received OK. It was during the Christmas season so shipper was probably busier than normal. I would have requested expedited service but shipper offered no delivery upgrades so I took my chances. Arrived on the very day it was presented as a Christmas gift!
3,I laugh every time I hear this song,"I have heard this song twice, and it's friggin' hilarious. It makes no sense. And what the hell is with the super deep voice every so often? Who put Whitey in the White House? You did baby. Knock it off Crash Test Dummies, you weird loons!"
4,very enjoyable,The Benjamin January is an enjoyable read for any lover of New Orleans and historical fiction
5,Snuggly warm boot liners,Bootliners are great. Delivery was speedy. I am a woman with size 91/2 shoe and the medium fit fine. Would be easier to select size - if you give female sizes that equate to male sizes. Thank you for a great product and fast delivery.
1,too small,I had to return these because I thought I was getting an electrical product what I received was small little things that look like they are for speaker wire. Don't try putting this in your house
2,I agree with the first reviewer...,"My 2 year old son really enjoys the tape for the variety of animals, but would probably be just as interested in a tape geared toward a more adult audience? He is not interested in the Spin character at all. Dudley Moore sounds like he's not getting paid enough to do the job! The information is not very well organized and the music (more than is necessary, in my opinion) is cheesy. The photography of the animals is great, but that's the only redeeming quality of this tape."
1,horrible,"i wanted a good educational video to show my kindergartners. This looked like a good one, but the quality is horrible. It looks like something made in the early 80s. There goes 2 bucks."
2,Really Wild Animals Swinging Safari,"My 4 year old just got this as a birthday gift. And the narrator ""Spin"" is incredibly annoying. My son doesn't like it at all, and neither do I for that matter. I was hoping it would be only music with a few facts about the animals but the narrator talks the WHOLE time. I have 3 DVD's the Swinging Safari, Totally Tropical Rainforest and Deep Sea Dive. I would not purchase these ever again. Not sure what else is out there that is better for a 4 year old attention span, but this is not it."
2,Not all it's cracked up to be,The animation is very old compared to what's available today. I was hoping the execution would be a little more savvy but I think there are better animal kingdom videos out there.
3,Boring for my 2-year-old,"My 2-year-old animal junkie son got bored about 20 minutes into this and started asking for ""Elmo's World."" Some of the footage is pretty old, and it doesn't have the same polish as the Baby Einstein dvds he's used to."
5,I love Poland Spring Water,I love Poland Springs water and buy it at BJs for about $5 for 36 bottles. I'd never buy it online on Amazon for $30-$60 for the same thing through. Highway robbery!
5,Favorite treat,Our dog has never been motivated by food/treat. And she refuses Milkbones - has a neat trick of dropping them in the wastebasket when the carwash guy gives them to her. But she'll stand next to her treat bowl when she knows they've been filled with Newman's Peanutbutter cookies. Loves them. So glad Amazon carries them so we can now purchase them in bulk.
2,No thanks,"Most of these songs are sung by the same person, and he even sings all of the different parts. He sounds like the Beach Boys with their soft slow flat sound. He is very talented, but that is not what I wanted to hear."
1,Below average content considering the price!,"This so-called manual might be compared with one of those superficial ""anarchist cookbooks"". The title promises more than the content offers.The author has apparently few skills in the field covered and offers little of valuable information to those in computer security or to the layman.William Haas"
3,Enjoyable but not practical,"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this cookbook. David Rosengarten is entertaining and absolutely dedicated to great food. Although the text was enjoyable and informative, most of the recipes seem like too much work and they are definitely not for every-day cooking. I have had the book for a couple of years and still have not actually tried any of the recipes. If you enjoy reading about food, this book is well worth it, but unless you are looking for very elaborate recipes for entertaining, don't buy it for the recipes."
4,Great sheets! Great Price! Everyday bed sheets,"Can't go wrong with this price for this quality set of bed sheets. The sheets are a bit stiff out of the package but after the second washing they are soft and comfortable. They look fantastic! The stiching is simple, no fancy edges or hems but for this price you just can't complain. I highly recommend these sheets for general everyday use."
5,"Very Impressed, Very Pleased","My wife admitted that she was skeptical when I told her the price of these sheets, but the skepticism is all gone. After sleeping with them for for six weeks and several launderings, they just keep feeling better and better. She also noted what a lovely sheen they have to them. Recently we stayed at one of the major hotels that touts their ""luxury"" bedding and we both agreed our Pike Street sheets at home felt significantly better. They have a nice ""heavy"" quality feeling to them while still being very soft and smooth to the touch. The only possible negative would be that they seem to come out of the dryer a bit on the wrinkled side. We can live with that minor problem, however, as they more than make up for it in comfort and quality."
4,nice set,"This is the first time I write the review. I am very satisfied with this product.1) I got it in low price.2) It is very soft and hight quality product.3) It fit my king size mattress.There is winkle, but it doesn't bother me."
5,Great sheets at an unbelievable price!,I was a little wary of ordering these sheets because the price was so low. But they arrived and my husband and I love them. I've paid much higher prices for a much lower thread count and quality. I'm definitely going to order another set!
5,Great sheets,"I was a little skeptical of the high customer rating for these sheets. I ordered them anyway based on great price. We have these sheets for a month now. Thease are great sheets. Very soft and smooth feel. Expect a lot of wrincles when they come out of the drier, but still great sheets none the less. Best sheets that I have used to date and the price is great too."
3,a little disappointed,"I'm a little disappointed that the sheets barely fit on our matress and they are not quite as soft as I anticipated. They have a nice weight to them, however. I washed them before I realized these things, so between that and the good price, I kept them."
3,Not as soft as I hoped. Good quality.,"I was so excited to finally get some nice sheets. After reading reviews and doing my own research I couldn't pass up the PIKE street set. I got the cream and they are gorgeous. However, they are not very soft at all. They ar thick (which is good), but also kind of scratchy. The only reason I kept them is because they have gotten softer with the first 3 washes and I pray they continue to get softer. They are also extremely wrinklely!"
5,very nice,I checked for correct fit before I washed them and they were a little too big but after washing they fit perfectly. They feel great and are not a wrinkled mess after washing and drying. Definitely value for the money.
5,Super nice and soft!,"I love the set, super nice and super soft. I would totally buy another set if they put in on sale like last time $31.99. No regrets!"
2,You might be disapointed - I was,"You would think that 800-thread-count sheets couldn't be bad, right? Well, we were a little disappointed. You can definitely see the very tightly woven fabric. I'm not sure what the problem is, but perhaps 800 threads/inch is too much. They almost remind me of having plastic sheets on the bed. I would have expected a very smooth satiny sheet, but they're a bit rough and loud. It's hard to slip out of bed and let your spouse sleep in without being noticed by the sound. Even after washing them several times, they're not much better. Perhaps a 400-thread-count sheet would better than these."
4,Great sheets,"These sheets are thick and smooth and launder well. I took off one star because my mattress is thick (18"") and the flat sheet is too short: It cannot be tucked under the sides. The fitted sheet fits perfectly"
3,Not especially soft,"The sheets are fine, but not especially soft. In this case, you get what you pay for (not luxury sheets for $50). I would compare them to 300 thread count."
2,For The Dylan Novice Only,"""The Best Of Bob Dylan"", is a very thin overview at best, and I can only recommend this disc to someone who has never owned a Dylan cd, and they want a small sampling[and I mean small], of a career that has spanned over 40 years. Most Dylan fans already own his more expansive collections, like ""Biograph"", and the ""Greatest Hits Vol, 1,2, and 3"" compilations. If you are new to Dylan, I would recommend the ""Essential Bob Dylan"", if you just want one CD. That double disc gives a healthy serving of Dylan classics, and is more complete. If you have never owned a Dylan collection before, and you buy this, try listening to his ""Blonde On Blonde"" or ""Blood On The Tracks"" cd to see what you have been missing!"
2,Want to spare a dollar for Columbia?,"I guess Columbia records need some money this Christmas to pay for new yacths for their excecutives. We already have Greatest Hits I, Greatest Hits II, Greatest Hits III, The Essential Bob Dylan, and now in time for the Holidays: The Best of Bob Dylan. Nothing special about this collection, in fact, its preety dumb trying to put tracks from the 60's, 70, 80, 90, and 2000's in the same CD. Its a mess and a very unnatural listen. Get the greatest hits packages, and from there, start collecting the albums. This compilation is nonsense."
1,Milkin' It,"Ugh....seems like every few years they put out a ""Definitive"", ""Complete"", ""Essential"", ""Greatest Hits"", compilation. The only way to describe it is the record company is milking these ""hits"" compilations as much as possible. 2 years after the release of this CD comesDylanand prior to that wasEssential Bob Dylan. I think there are plenty of collections now for a new fan just getting into Dylan to buy. It is time to put an end to it, stop making these please. Thanks"
3,It's okay,"A bit ""flat"" - not much dynamic range. Perhaps it's the MP3. Content is a nIce reminder of the songs I listened to in my youth."
3,Not Really the Best of Bob Dylan,"There are some GREAT SONGS on here, don't get me wrong. But this cd just isn't the best of Dylan. I would liken this to taking 16 lines from every Shakespeare play and calling it ""the best of shakespeare' - you get a glimpse but not a clear picture or good idea of what makes Bob Dylan great. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, except for hardcore Dylan fans who collect every release. If you're just getting into Dylan, go for ""Blood on the Tracks,"" or even the Essential Dylan. The spirit of the songs are really lost because of the limited space (1 disc) and the time span covered (40 years)."
5,It can change your life if you're open to it.,"There were times in the beginning when I was skeptical, looking for proof, but as I went on, something clicked. There's no way to ""prove"" if he's being honest, but I don't think that's the intention, since I've read it, I've been noticing that things aren't always a coincidence'things that happened which would take too long to explain here. His theories and stories have changed my everyday life.It's definitely not a book for everyone, but if you want to be open to god, I think it will open your awareness. If nothing else, its definitely interesting"
2,Windy blabbering,"Don't waste your time or money on this book. It is boring, and bland. If you are looking for spiritual books ,try Jack Kornfield's After Ecstasy ,Laundry.A un-put-downable piece of work."
3,Disappointed,"I'm not sure what I was expecting, but this wasn't it. I quit reading half-way through."
3,What is her new book ?,"I have this book, we liked it - but I have seen quirte a few of the items written in various other places in previous years, I read a LOT - still, overall its funny and ok reading.I hear she has a new book out -- does anyone know the TITLE of J.D. Mitchell's NEW BOOK and where I could get it? ThanksThe Ultimate Blonde"
1,Unhappy,"I liked this prodcut after I finally got it set, which was not easy. It worked great for one week and then the batteries run down. I had to get a new set of batteries every week. I tried using it for six weeks and used four set of batteries. Unfortunally too long to return it. I would not recommend this product."
4,Great little item for the price,"I purchased this because it was featured in Prevention magazine. It made the ""top 10 list"" of pedometers. I ended up getting it on Amazon for half of the price the article quoted (not sure how old article was). After testing it out, i ordered another for a back-up and one as a gift for my sister! The steps/mileage counter is pretty accurate. The only complaint I have is the reception for radio is not the best (I assume because antennea is internal?). The voice feature is pretty cool! I'm very satisfied with this purchase!"
2,This is not a vampire story.,"This story has nothing to do with vampires. It is only in the last few pages of the book that anything ""vampiric"" happens. If you are looking for a love story, this might work. But, if you are looking for a ""paranormal"" romance- look elsewhere."
3,Fangs,I had some issues with this bookn it was not up to par with the notion that Christian may be the strongest of the brothers. There was no fight in Rhys to see how strong he was in the first novel (Fangs for the Memories). Christian did not do enough shadowing and misting. This book appeared to have taken his vampire strength away which should have been impossible. It could have appeard that he could have become weaker at some stage in this book but not completely without his strength.
5,Fangtasitic!,"Great series, Kathy Love really knows how to hook you in and keep you reading. Hilarious!"
3,Not as Good as the First Book,"I was I little disappointed in this book. It wasn't deep enought for me. If you compare it to her first book, it just didn't have the drama and it just seemed like it was missing something that I can't put my finger on.I would still read this book. It was a good a book. It got three stars from me because I was expecting it to be an even greater book. Looking forward to the third book in her series."
2,Not a Vampire Romance,"I was so bored by this book, I kept asking myself why I bothered continuing to read it. The vampire lead is trying his best not to be a vampire...and as a result we rarely see any of his vampire attributes. This is a mundane romance novel where in the last chapter there's a revelation of ""oh yeah, by the way I'm a vampire."" The lead didn't need to be a vampire, and there's no creation of a vampire 'world.' If you're looking for a paranormal romance, try a different author. This book can barely claim to be a part of the paranormal genre."
4,Excellentn textbook for Italian foundation basics,"This is a great book for learning the basics of Italian. It starts off pretty simply and then slowly increases in difficulty. The topics of each chapter are not useless like some textbooks but makes use of real life every day situations while at the same time giving you a glimpse of Italian culture.Comes with tapes and a workbook. I would suggest buying all of them and working with them to practice your speaking, listening, reading and writing skills. At times the book can be a bit corny which is why I gave it 4 stars, but I got a good grounding in Italian from this book and would recommend it to others as well!Keithhttp://language.engagedthinking.com"
3,Atonal,"Forget about harmony, forget about rhythem. Some of Antibes hangs together quite well but much of it walks on the dark side of free jazz. Get ""Blues and Roots"" if you want to hear something that was made with care -- the musical ideas, while similar, are executed better."
3,indigo,"This book did not have a very real plot Alice should have put some excitment into it. I thought the story would be good when Trevor, Eli and Martha decided to leave home but they quickly ended up having to turn around. This is a very quick read (i read it in an hour) although this book is not all that good Alice Hofman's other book Aquamarine is very exciting."
1,Okay....,"Yah this is a great book...NOT!! It has no plot, none at all. What type of plot is it to have to mermaid men-people going to the ocean with thier motherless friend,(who dances with scarves), OHHH wait a moment their not going to the ocean, they have to go back and save thier town which AFTER DAMMING UP THE CREEK is being flooded. The most action filled part of the book is maybe when they SWIM in the creek...UMMM HELLO WHEN I BOUGHT THE BOOK I WAS EXPECTING A STORY NOT A FAILED ATTEMPT AT A YOUNG CHILDS TALE...A VERY VERY BAD TALE... you read it and theres some BIG secret or something...ummm don't know 'bout you but I feel cheated...very cheated..."
1,Indigo,"What a stupid waste of money on my part!!! I spent 5 dollars, 5 dollars on this book and it's 5 chapters long. That's a dollar per puny chapter. Absoulutly no plot. No defined characters. WHAT A WASTE OF TREES!!!!!!!"
3,A Good Start,"This particular story has some very intriguing characters. Such as:Trout and Eel-- the two adopted young men with startling qualities such as webbed fingers. And an affinity for the water, in a town where that love for water is not accepted at all.Martha-- a young lady struggling with a search for idenity and the loss of her mother. She is filled with longing to be somewhere else.Various Townspeople-- scarred with a paralyzing fear of the water. Which directly impacts the water loving young men in the story.The only problem with this story is that it doesn't go to the depth an inquisitive reader would like. I find this especially vexing because the characters are so likeable and you just want to know more!I do however reccomend this book. It is a fast paced read and is enjoyable if brief. Pick it up and get attached to a quirky bunch of characters, only to find yourself wanting more!"
2,I wanted to like it... I really did,"Okay, so pretty much this is the story of two boys who live in one of the most boring towns ever. No one is allowed to swim, because they blocked off the resivor long ago, to prevent flooding. Unfortunately for the two boys their lives' dream is to see the ocean. Called weird by every body in town except a new girl Martha Glimmer, the two boys Trout and Eel decide to run away taking Martha with them. To make an already short story shorter and easier to type the boys (and Martha) don't get very far before this wierd kind of flash flood happens. So Trout and Eel have to help the people who tormented them and the whole town is gratefull and so on. This book didn't have any action in it and was very boring. I feel like it ended too soon.... Like a book with a beginning and end, but no middle. Overall this book was a let down."
3,Odd One Out,"I thought the book Indigo, was a very interesting book. The first time I read this book I thought it to be sort-of scary and some what repulsive. I mean a town that only allows its citizens to take 5 to 10 minuet shower, and have a pool but won't feel it with water is, I thought, to be odd. I understand the concept that they are scared of water after the huge flood that they had but in my opinion, this is still odd. Overall I give this book a 3 star because it was a little weird, but I also thought it to be one of those books where you just can't put it down."
4,Loving it and Wishing it Were Longer,"I think that Indigo, by Alice Hoffman, is a wonderful book. It is an adventure story that can really grab your attention.Indigo is about two boys, born with webbing between their fingers and toes, and their friend Martha. They live in a town that is mortally afraid of water. The boy's desire for salt water leads them on a journey to the ocean. But when rain starts flooding the town, will they turn back to save their friends or will they continue towards their dreams?Indigo may be short, but don't judge a book by its cover or length! The book is beautifully written using vivid description. I would recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a book they can read quickly and totally enjoy."
5,Indigo,"If you like books with strange kids this is the book for you. Indigo is about two boys whose mother was a mermaid, but she died in a boat accident. The boys have thin layers of webbing between every finger and toe. They've even earned the nicknames Eel and Trout for their lighitning speed in water. They've dreamed about swimming, but their father forbids it. He forbids it because he once had to save the town from a tragic flood. [He doesn't trust water.] The boys are planning on running away to ocean city. Will they or will they not?BY ALANZO"
4,Indigo,"Ashley May CollinsIndigoAlice HoffmanDo you like the ocean? Well if you do you will like this story. This story is about a girl named Martha and her two best friends, Trout and Eli. Martha is a nice, respectful girl who is lonely most of the time. When she is with her friends she is very happy. They all want to live in a city by the ocean, not Oak Grove. But their mothers and fathers will not let them because of the floods. After Martha's mother died, she ran away to Ocean City with Trout and Eli. Then Martha broke her arm and had to go home. This is a adventurous, exciting, magical, mysterious and sad book. The best part was when Martha dances under the moon with her mother's shawl. Ages 8-70 would like this book."
1,one sided garbage,"This book only briefly explains the SHARP skins..( anti rascist skinheads) but throughout upholds the image that all skinheads are rascist..making it seem that only a few are non rascist...this is wrong. The original roots of skinhead culture were anti rascist who believed in pride and support for the working class , family , friends , beer , and standing up for whats right. This repeats over and over ""skinheads are violent individuals who believe in destroying culture different than their own""..this is just the media's attempt to destroy the skinhead name. Throw it in the fire with all the other hype books."
5,Outstanding!,"This is a one-of-a-kind book, like no other one on the subject on the market. It's mostly about racist skins but there is plenty about antiracists, too. It's not a historical read on the subject, but rather a book that provides an in-depth insight to how skins think, act and what they want. I recommend it to students writing a paper, police officers and community folks. Those who haven't liked the book are those skins of a particular set who feel they have been slighted."
5,Spiritual food for the Western seeker,"This book is wonderful. It really wakes up your senses and gets you thinking about the simplest of things that have been right in front of you your whole life! Like the basic implications of what it means to be male or female, and how this relates to the mind. Never dogmatic, but often challenging and even confrontational, you will learn something from this book.And like some of the people reviewing this book here, you may not like it! But then just because our ego doesnt like something doesnt mean it isn't true.Speaking of truth I have to say this book has the fewest errors of any spiritual book I've read. It really cuts to the heart of the matter and drops all the nonsense and Eastern verbage that put me to sleep in Buddhist books.Heartily recommended!"
3,Great Guide for Patient People,"As others have previously stated, the book is full of errors. That being said, I loved the book.The book has helped me jump from a beginner to an intermediate user of Access.I would recommend the title only for those with a background in programming who just need to apply their knowledge to Access. If you have no knowledge of programming, forget about undrstanding this book.I liked the author's approach to teaching the Access/VBA programming environment/language. Like *Special Edition Using Access 2000* the use of VBA is strongly recommended as apposed to using Macros. In fact both books do not delve into Macros at all. If you feel you need to learn about Macros, I strongly recommend *Running Access 2000*.The book has very little fluff and gets you right into programming.Perhaps the book was just perfect for me at where I was in using Access. You definitely need to know the basics of Access before reading this book."
2,"Editor Needs to Read ""Editing for Dummies""","I got a lot of use out of the Access 95 version of this book. Unfortunately, the edition for Access 2000 smells (and this is a very descriptive word to use) of being rushed to print. It is filled with errors that a thorough review should have caught, e.g., the CD doesn't load per the instructions in the book, the first data file on the CD doesn't run because of duplicate subroutine names, figures don't show what the text says they should, errors in coding examples. I think the potential buyer would be smart to wait for the second edition. Unless you already know Access well enough to fight through the errors, this book is not the one for you."
1,I hate to think of how many trees were wasted for this dog,"I won't say this book is completely useless because it works well as a door stop. I found this book poorly organized, badly presented and the ""real world"" examples were less than germaine. The author talks about SQL, Access Basic and macros without bothering to explain when one might be more appropriate than another. Crucial terms and concepts were left undefined or defined so vagely as to be of dubious value. The writing is also as dry as the Sahara during a drought and has none of irreverent style that has made the For Dummies books so popular. Save yourself the 20 bucks. You'll learn a lot more using using the Access online help feature"
2,"Bad editor, Good Author","The editor of this book should say sorry to the book author as he/she made this book with so many errors. He/she needs to learn basic editing skill. By the way, if I am the hire, I will fire him/her on the spot."
3,Perversely useful,"I found the book easy to use and well-organized for relating VB to Access. Also, in its own perverse way, this book was very helpful: once I understood that the book was full of errors, I used the errors to help me learn. I agree with other reviewers, though, that they should have hired an editor. (Also, on general principles, I suggest buying it from your local independent bookseller)."
3,"Excellent annecdotes, but could have used more structure","Ms. Jardine has written a very good book, her usage of historical annecdotes to portray the penetration of affluence during the Renaissance is well written and her stories are poignant.What they are poignant about, however is up to the reader to decipher, as I felt the book could have used more direction in delivering the author's point about the penetration of wealth.The book would have benefitted in more organization in the content level, perhaps being chronologically based."
1,Amateur History Parading as Wish Fulfillment,"For an astute & royal trashing of this crassly enthusiastic & unknowing tripe see the first chapter/essay in the masterful Ingrid Rowland's From Heaven to Arcadia: The Sacred & the Profane in Renaissance.The very popularity (& initial promotional machinery) of Jardine's ""argument"" is telling enough: a self-serving & wholly wishful justification for modern consumerism.All too vulgar in the classic sense of the word."
4,Definitely worth getting,"This book provided an interesting view into one important aspect of this period. Its definitely cheap enough to buy compared to many books in this category so if you are on the fence, get it."
1,A long and dull read,"This book makes up for a lack of a coherent narrative with endless quotes. Jardine discusses the many ways in which the trade in worldly goods - spices, books, works of art, jewels, and other riches - expanded during the Renaissance. But it is an incoherent tale, where the overall narrative is lost in the desire to delve into the minutiae. Explanations are few and far between, what abounds instead are endless shopping list by medieval princes. How they lived and what the motivations were of these characters is not discussed. One is left with a profound sense of boredom."
3,Not Bad but Still Biased and Incomplete,"This book is comprehensive, and somewhat fair to the creationist position. However, it still presents a distorted portrayal of creationism. Too much emphasis is placed on the personalities and politics of creationism. And Numbers spends very little time discussing the research done by scientific creationists. Finally, Numbers is clearly incorrect in implying that Steven Austin is the only creationist geologist. While others are perhaps less well known, there are in fact many other creationist geologists. Numbers seems to lack appreciation for the fact that numerous intelligent people reject organic evolution in favor of special creation."
3,"Fun classic, raunchy teen comedy","This is the classic genre of a teen boy trying to get laid. The movie for the most part isn't that great, the only fun twist I found about it was that they gave all the kids in the movies names from Archie Comics. The story is about Archie and him trying to get laid by Betty or Veronica."
2,Action/Adventure Movie starring Anna Nicole Smith,"Weak plot and weak acting. However, you will get to see a lot of Anna Nicole Smith, both dressed and undressed. Which adds much to this ""B"" type movie. If you are an Anna Nicole Smith fan, and what male is not?, then this movie is for you."
2,What a stupid movie!!!!,I think that TO THE LIMIT definatly had some bad acting and the story sucked but Anna Looked good.
2,Not as Bad as I Was Hoping For,"To be perfectly honest, I bought this movie because I expected it to be horrifically bad. You know, bad acting, bad dialog, bad plot? The whole works. For the most part it succeeded in all of these areas, but it's missing something from making it the camp classic it could be. I watched it once, laughed hysterically when Anna Nicole started screaming about making babies or something, but barely chuckled through the rest of it. I'll probably watch it again while having a six pack or something just to see if I missed anything, but so far the camp value is minimal at best. Maybe this is a B rate B movie?"
4,Solid B-list film,"This film is a great example of a B-movie. That does not mean it is a bad movie. Anna-Nicole Smith does a good job, the storyline is solid (better than some mainstream films) and action is done well considering budget. In a lot of ways, this is a movie you might see on SciFi with the addition of some nudity.The film centers around Anna-Nicole's character, and it has merit. What makes it a little hard to watch at times is the bad acting of some of the others.Overall, this is a solid film, worthy of watching and for the Anna-Nicole fans a must own for the collection, even more so now with her passing. This movie along with her other major film credit (Skyscraper) show off the fact that had she been given the support and opportunity, she had a shot at becoming a Hollywood starlet."
3,I liked it!,"This is the ultimate Mob vs. Bad CIA flunkies cliche movie. It is so *bad* that it is funny! I found myself laughing at the film's unintentional humor so much, I came away liking it. Of course, if you don't want to buy a film just to laugh at the outrageous stupidity of it, don't buy it. Oh yeah, they have Anna Nicole Smith in it too, showing her, um, talents, once or twice."
1,incorrect at the core,"the core purpose of this book is to ""debunk"" psychodynamic therapy, but the definition of psychodynamic therapy that the authors use is fundamentally incorrect. they also lump virtually all talk therapy into one category and call it psychodynamic which is also incorrect.yes, many of Freud's theories are/were flawed and not empirically supported, and most psychologists realize this. most psychologists do not base their practice and theory on Freud alone. True psychoanalysis is still around, but psychoanalysis is not psychodynamic therapy.the only thing i liked about this book is the fact that it supports pharmacotherapy. however, pharmacotherapy and talk therapy of some variety is really the way to go. if you are considering therapy, don't look to this book for help--find a book with a more balanced approach."
3,Not really as described,"Although very well made, the Rainbow Sound Blocks are rattles. Describing them as having different ""tones"" was misleading, as I interpreted that as something more musical, not just the sounds of various-sized little beads shaking around. It seems to me to be more appropriate for younger children (babies) just picking up their first blocks and rattles, not really that stimulating or educational. The idea of creating different color combinations as you look through two blocks together was great, but most of the color combinations didn't actually come through, i.e., looking through a red block together with a yellow block still looked red, blue and red together didn't create purple, etc. Since the beautiful wooden ""box"" the blocks come in doesn't have sides, it can never be used for anything except storing these blocks, which for most people probably won't happen very often. For me, this was an expensive rattle toy; had I seen this in a store, I never would have purchased it."
2,Not great,I bought these for my 1 year old and for my 3 1/2 year old. The colors of the blocks are not bright like shown. Maybe in front of a bright window in the dead of summer but in a normal lit room they are all dark and hazy looking. It's hard to see the beads and the sound they make are not unique or musical.The box they come in is wasted and just a source of confusion and annoyance to my children who really want to put the blocks inside. The front and back is open so the blocks just fall out as they try to place them in. Plexy glass or another hard plastic (like the blocks themselves!) would have made a lot of sense for the sides of the box.A really great idea just needs some tweaking.
4,colorful and soothing,"we bought this for our 6 year old grandson who is autistic. the colors were bright, construction of individual pieces were very well made (out of wood) and the beads inside each shape was very soothing. great for eye and hand coordination skills"
2,Very small,"The blocks are REALLY small and not worth the ~$20.00 I paid for them. They are nothing special, just beads in a colored block. They might be great for a 6-8 month old baby, but my three year old wont even give them a glance when I pull them out of the toy chest."
2,Didn't even last 6 months before they started falling apart... 7 months later and they are HISTORY,I run a childcare home and bought 3 of these for 4 babies... yes I said kids under 18 months. all three toys have come apart where the wood meets ( not the blocks themselves but the casing). Not impressed considering they don't get alot of use. I keep them on a shelf for use once a week
1,Splinters,Not a good toy for a young child. The wood started to splinter and so we decided it wasn't good quality
3,bought for autistic teen,"it's a cool product but not all that mesmerizing, he likes to line them up or move them around and watch them some, but it's not a favorite."
3,Definitely for kids,"As an adult, I found the moral good, but the humor is definitely aimed and should appeal to 8-12 year olds, certainly not more. Editing is poor, and there are some funny one-liners for an older crowd, but most will find it too juvenile. Kids are not as ""Beaver Cleaver"" as they used to be, so this is not too crude and the younger kids will enjoy it, and hopefully learn a realistic lesson from it."
4,Gross Humor,"Okay this will mostly appeal to the males since it has a great deal of butt humor. That said some ladies will find it mildly amusing as well. Good cast, over the top sets and effects, and decent comedy writing make this a winner if you like ""Sandlot"", ""Napolean Dynamite"", or ""Shallow Hal"". I think there is a place for this kind of movie. But you may want to screen it before showing the whole family.Three men interrupt some bullies in a kids league from kicking a group of local kids playing on the field. The agreement is if the three men beat the team of bullies, the neighborhood kids get the field. Their victory leads to a challenge against all the kids teams and a professional baseball field in the offing. I think this is goofy enough and yet has enough of a message to appeal to most families."
2,"Ok Movie, Not As Funny As I Thought It Would Be.","Im a fan of stupid movies but this one just didnt really do it for me. It is the story of 3 adults who got picked on as kids taking on all the cool athletic kids to claim a victory in the name of nerds everywhere. Interesting concept with a lot of one liners but very few of which were funny. Sure I chuckled here and there but if you want to see this movie I would suggest renting it over buying it. Im not saying dont watch it, Im just saying dont expect much."
2,"""Gus Is The New Jet Li"" ~ Baseball Buffoonery & Buggers","What starts out as a hilariously funny movie about three guys challenging a little league baseball team of bullies to a game takes a turn for the worse about 30 minutes into the story and never quite recovers. Rob Schneider, Jon Heder, David Spade, Jon Lovitz and Nick Swardson (who steals the show) all have their moments, but they really aren't given much to work with.Probably worth a watch if you're a fan of any of the above mentioned comedians, otherwise I'd pass. If you like bugger humor, dwarf directed jokes and closet homosexuality have at it."
1,epic fail,This movie is the epitome of why American children are becoming more stupid and more rude. Wish I could get my money back.
1,This movie was really dumb!,I'm a huge fan of Jon Heder and loved him in Napoleon Dynamite but as for the movie it sucks. Jon Heder acts so retarded in this movie. The jokes are so lame and stupid. It was cool seeing that Knight Rider car and I loved that house with all the Star Wars junkies but this movie wasn't funny at all. I didn't laugh once. I wanted to leave the theater during the middle of it. It looked more like a Bad News Bears rip off to me. Don't waste your money wait till it comes on cable.
1,was the director in a coma or something?,"Ok firstly I watch a lot of movies put up with a lot of them too and can usually see a little silver lining in all of them but benchwarmers was unacceptable. It was crude, Insensitive, Racist and was pretty munch a freak show for the viewers. The humor was basically we see three nerds who are dumb and were supposed to laugh at them they form a baseball team we see some kids get crudely tortured by other kids but then the kids getting picked on get pay back by just doing the exact same things back, we see a dumb latin man ooooh lets laugh, we see a homosexual couple hardy har har oh look the dwarf cant reach the microphone buy himself isnt that hilarious. I would not recommend this to anyone who believes in kindness and respect because it was neither. Napoleon dynamite was way way better and I cant see any comparison between the to. Basically the movie was a adult eight crazy nights that was twice as crazy."
1,What a disappointment,"I loved Napolean Dynamite and was interested to see Jon Heder in a different role. Sadly, this is the movie I watched. If I was 10 years old I might have liked it. I guess I should have expected it - any time Rob Schneider (?) plays the straight man you're asking for trouble. The original premise is cute, but the kids are not seen nearly enough, the emotions never wring true, and all the characters are very flat. Enough with the booger jokes!"
3,love it or hate it,"I saw this movie because I am a big Jon Heder fan. He was very funny in this movie. I really liked David Spade's agoraphobic brother too. Rob Schneider really didn't have anything funny or stupid to say, which was kind of refreshing. Anyway, this movie is funny if you like crude kind of humor. If you are the kind of person who likes to analize movies, you will go crazy. If you are in the mood for a very simple laugh, then this is for you. Throughout the movie most people were laughing out loud."
3,It has a few very funny scenes.,"Sure, the movie is dumb. The story is crazy, and most of the humor is toilet humor. But, it is funny. This movie will win no awards, but you will laugh a few times. I gave it a 3 star rating because the times I did laugh I almost fell out of my chair.I didn't find it a belly laugh for 90 mins. But it was well worth watching for some of the good gags this movie does have.If you are overly sensitive to homosexual, feces, vomit, or slapstick jokes then you might want to skip this one and rent a movie that is a little more stuffy."
2,"Stupid, corny, and gross... now this is why the French are worried about cultural contamination!","This movie gets one star for being an excessively thin story, full of nose picking, nipple twisting, and scat depositing gags. It gets three stars for being funny.I was lucky this was the ""free"" movie of the ""buy two, get one free"" routine. I let a 15 year old pick the third, and this was the result.Of course, I am not the target audience for this movie. It was never designed to appeal to me. And it DID appeal to the teenage set, I could tell. In fact, I learned after watching the movie that nipple twisting was the ""rage"" during football this year. Woe is me! A generation of boys contaminated for life!And I certainly deserve a slap on the wrist for laughing too many times. Now this is why the French are worried about cultural contamination! Of course, the French WERE huge fans of Jerry Lewis...."
5,Hilarious,Ok anyone who didnt like this movie if you are reading this f u! Jon Heder is so frikin funny in this movie!! Get this movie its really funny but a lot of cussing and sexual stuff
3,BASEBALL HIJINKS,"As far as grossout silly comedies go, THE BENCHWARMERS delivers a lot of laughs, especially if you like a lot of flatulent humor, boogar-eating, and politically incorrect humor. The trio of Rob Schneider, David Spade and Jon Heder play three nerdish guys who decide it's time to show the little jocks in the neighborhood what it's like to be the kids who never got to play ball and had to suffer embarrassment at the jocks' expense. Jon Lovitz shows up as a billionaire former child nerd who holds a tournament with these three adults and promises a new stadium to the winners.You've seen it all before in the Bad News Bears movies, but it's moral message resonates and it is tastelessly entertaining."
5,the best movie ever,"this movie is so stupidly funny, its the only movie that i can watch over ten times, its just so funny and entertaining"
4,Funny Movie!,"I love this movie and we have it on DVD, but I like to buy a few of my favorites to watch on the PSP. So if you like comedy, watch this..."

3,"O.k., it does have it funny parts...","My son and husband loved it, I didn't see a lot about it that I cared for but I don't think they marketed this movie to my demographic group. It does have a good message in the end, and if you don't mind a little crude humor it will make for a good movie night."
2,It was Okay,"I must say this movie was disappointing to me. Rob Schneider, David Spade, Jon Heder and Adam Sandler at the wheel I expected this to be a funnier movie. It has a good message in the movie, but it could have been better imo"
5,The Benchwarmers,"I like this DVD. It's very funny and the actors know how do their job. The principal actor gives courage to the whole team, and that's what the movie is about; not to be treated less in front of others."
3,AMERICA'S CRITIC,BENCHWARMERS FELL OFF THE BENCH IT FELL SHORT WAS OK FUNNY BUT NOT HILLARIOUS FUNNY THE ONLY PART THAT HAD ME CRACKING UP WAS THE SQUERRELS!! ANYWAY RENT THIS ONE BEFORE YOU PURCHASE THIS MOVIE..
3,The Benchwarmers,"The Benchwarmers is the funniest movie that I have seen so far this year. I haven`t laughed so hard out loud in the theater since White Chicks. It sends a good message to all kids out there who get picked on and bullied. This film was a great comeback for Rob Shnieder who starred in the terrible Duece Bigalow: European Gigalow. I loved him in this! John Heder isn`t the best actor in the world and it`s a little hard to see him as another character other than ""Napolean Dynamite."" But he was the funniest guy in the whole movie. I give this movie ""3"" outta 4 stars."
1,if you wanna die,"during my life, i had the unfurtunate luck to watch this movie. What can i say, its a surprise that i came out alive of that movie. The people who gave this 5 stars are clearly unstable and on drugs. This is by far the worst movie i have seen so if youre buying it, have a gun with you just in case."
4,Very Good Story,"Judith Tarr has taken fictional characters and woven them in with historical characters to make the story line plausible. The plot lines, primary and secondary, are strong and well written. The characters are well developed and believable, even with the knowledge many of the characters are fiction. This was a well told story and a well written book."
3,Going through the motions,"Judith Tarr has written some great books, but this isn't one of them. Ms. Tarr seems to have cobbled together some notes and thrown out a half-baked novel. Her characters are usually brilliant, here they are muddy. Her world is often well realized, here it's slapped together.Still, it's better than half the SF/Fantasy pumped out and spat at the market."
2,Not for Vigor Owners,"Coverage of the Vigor is, at best, an afterthought. Not much usable information here. If you want Vigor documentation, this isn't it.Coverage of Integra and Legend is better, and more typical of Chilton's manuals. Not bad. Not great."
1,A Shame to Anthropological Research,"This book is a terrible addition to Anthropological research. Not only does English-Lueck rely on hundreds of undergrads for her research in Silicon Valley, This book never goes into depth in any topic that is mentioned, and midway in the book the author states that the stories are made up from compiled data, thus the people in it are not real. The book never gets into the swing and compels people to want to continue to read. The author also makes claims without backing it up with data (which there should be).If you want to know how not to write an ethnography- this would be your book."
2,Desire a brighter line.,"The laser attached easily to my Dewalt 12"" miter saw. The laser was accurate and didn't require any adjustment. I will have to change the batteries in case the shipped one's are duds. But out of the box the laser line is so weak I can't see it outside on an overcast day in the shade. In the garage it seems bright enough to be useful. I don't have experience with other lasers so I'm not sure if the outdoor use is even realistic but I base my 2 stars on that because that is where I use the saw the most and hence for me it is practically useless."
2,Doesn't fit DW716 Miter Saw,Seemed like a great idea. Wish it worked on my saw. Tried this product on the Dewalt DW716 Compound Miter Saw and it would not tighten the blade against the back washer leaving the blade to spin freely. I did not purchase it thru Amazon. I will be returning it to where I bought it.
1,dan briggs,"I just bought this unit from another supplier and am returning it. The unit is NOT adjustable and the laser projected 1"" INSIDE the edge of the blade. I am not sure if this is a 1 of a kind problem with the one I received, since other reviewers with same saw, 708, say it works fine for them..........finally added duct tape to inside edge and that move laser line outside blade, but still doesn't line up with actual cut."
3,Nice,I bought this because of the price. It works well although it shoots to the left a bit.The problem is I really don't use it as I still line up the cut the old fashioned way.I could have bought a saw blade for what I paid for this.
3,Better than nothing...,"I was excited to have a laser for my Sears Comapanion miter saw. I installed it and one of the moving parts hit the arbor bolt as the saw was lowered. I used it anyway, knowing it wouldn't create any hazard. I quickly learned to line up my pencil mark with the right side of the red beam and was satisfied. A few weeks later, the laser quit. Upon disassembly, I found the battery spring corroded. I was disappointed with that. Otherwise a useful item. Dec 2008."
5,Great deal.,"I was worried about the reviews that said it cuts to the right of the laser. The left edge of the saw blade cuts right up to the edge of the laser. It only took a couple of cuts to get used to this and now I love it. I did crown moulding in 5 rooms, which would have been very difficult without a laser on the saw. This laser is well worth the money."
1,Batteries in both were dead--one whichI gave as a gift does not work-now I know why they were so cheap,dead batteries and one of the two i bot does not work. Also the one that does work does not place the laser line at the very edge of the subsequent kerf cut--slightly to the left.
2,Irwin Miter Saw Laser Guide,"The Guide mounts and installed easily, but it does not project the line where the blade cuts. The line is at least 1/8 inch to left of cut. Provides reference onlyand changes position depending on the height of the saw blade. I guess I got what I paid for, but it was not what I wanted."
4,Irwin laser guide for Ryobi miter saw.,I purchased the Irwin Miter Saw laser guide after my Ryobi laser guide refused to operate. I notified Ryobi to purchase a new laser guide and was surprised by the extraordinary high price. Irwin's laser guide fit perfectly on the shaft of the saw and operated flawlessly. The guide comes with three select securing nuts and two hex wrenches for different manufacturers.I have been using the Irwin guide with the miter saw and I am highly satisfied with my purchase. The price was well within acceptable as opposed to Ryobi's replacement price. I will investigate other Irwin products in the future if this device is any indication of Irwin's ability to provide quality replacement products.
4,Works For Me Too,"I mounted the laser guide per instructions on a not so young Sears Miter Saw and had no issues what so ever and it works great, sure you have to start the saw to see the laser but after half a dozen cuts you don't even think about that anymore. This saved me from myself as I have been drooling over Miter Saws with a laser and so for a couple of bucks I have a reasonable substitute and can spend them bucks for something more useful in the shop."
5,Fantasatic little tool!,"I bought this ""to try it"" and it turns out to be a great tool! I use it on my Delta #36-235 Sidekick Miter Sawinstalling crown molding. It does a perfect job of aligning the blade with the cut marks. Makes the whole job a pleasure; if you can say installing crown molding is a pleasure!"
3,Not for some Dewalt miter saws,Bought for a Dewalt sliding compound miter saw and it did not fit. The bolt would not tighten all the way and the blade wobbled around when running full speed
4,Laser Guide is well worth the price,"I put off adding a laser guide to my Delta Miter Saw, but wound up involved in a major project with lots of angled cuts. This device fit the Delta perfectly and shows a very visible line (not as bright as I would like in bright sunlight) and makes cut alignment much easier."
4,laser on makita ls1212,"After a minor modification to the saw (filed down a tab that is part of the automatic blade guard), it works perfectly! :)"
1,failed,as a hobby user this item stopped working in less than 12 uses and 90 days. i changed the batterys with no success. irwin said after 30 days that there was nothing that they could do for me. today i am going to buy another brand.
1,No wonder it was so inexpensive it almost ruined my Miter saw,It arrived with corroded batteries and would not work. Thought it was very a very inexpensive price and now I know why
4,Works but not really needed.,"I installed it on a Dewalt 10 in Mitre saw (713). It installed with no issues and works pretty much as advertised. It isn't really a true laser as it is offset to the left of the blade instead of being right where the blade cuts. I find it just as easy to line up the blade as I do using the laser light.It is easy to see when using indoors, I haven't tried it outside. All in all for $10 you can't really go wrong."
3,Not to happy,"Not to happy with the product I don't like the fact that the laser does not line up with the cut. Its off by an 1/8/"" so you have to adjust the cut each time. I removed it from the saw and went back to the old reliable way (pencil line and line up the blade)."
1,Did not work on my DW708,"I figured for $10.00 I'd give this unit a try. I mounted it on my DW708. Laser is very bright and wide as compared to the one that came on my Makita LS1016L. As other reviews have mentioned, the laser cannot be adjusted. However, within the instruction manual there is a section titled ""alignment"". First step is to align the laser with your mark. Then make cuts on various types and thicknesses of wood and see how the two ""align"". It is assumed that repeating this process over and over ""will teach you the correct position for aligning the laser line with your mark"". In other words, your suppose to remember the difference between your mark and the laser and adjust accordingly. In my case, the difference was close to 1/16 inch. It's a process that exemplifies the saying ""practice makes perfect"". This renders this item useless as any type measuring tool, it's simply a laser light show attached to a miter saw..."
1,Quit with little use!,"Purchased one of these some time back and worked for a short while and quit....not the battery. It probably didn't have 2 hours run time. ;-(I did like it while it worked very accurate on my Mikita 10"" slider."
1,2 different styles not mentioned.,"I accidentally got the style that projects a beam along the edge of the blade and really liked the unit. I bought one for a friend and got one that projects a beam about an 1/8"" to the left of the blade which defeats the idea of the laser guide. From the various descriptions and pictures you can't always tell what you are buying: best to buy the unit in person."
2,"Didn't fit my Denai 10"" Miter Saw","Ordered this at the same time I purchased the Denali 10"" Miter Saw from Amazon. It's a good thing that the Laser Guide comes with a 30 money back guarantee because it did not fit properly in the saw. The mechanism for the saw cover got in way of the laser so it was rubbing against it. I returned the Laser Guide to Amazon and I got a full refund without the normal shipping deduction. I'm glad that I got the refund but I wished it had worked out with my saw."
3,A 4-1 for having to guess the kerf.............,"Everyone thinks ""laser accuaracy"" but it's only one side that is accurate, if you are always going to cut material from the left side then this will be fine, but having to guess the width of the blade makes this take about as much time as the old trial and error method when cutting from the right. I have a Bosch 5412 with the factory laser and I can say the same thing of it. This is instaled on a DW706. I need accuracy for fine cutting crownmold and trim and frankly if this was not just $15 after all the Amazon deals and coupons I would have tried to send it back."
3,"Also does not fit Ryobi 12"" Saw","Although not listed on the package it does not fit the Ryobi 12"" Miter saws."
2,Irwin Industrial Tools 3061001 Miter Saw Laser Guide,"I own an older DeWalt Miter Saw and this is not the lazer guide for use with this saw. I am notd out much money, but this has proven to be useless for my purposes."
1,I Returned It!,"When I installed this laser guide on my Hitachi miter saw, it induced a wobble in the blade. I removed and reinstalled the laser guide at least 6 times, and each time, the blade wobbled. The laser certainly worked, but I'd rather have a true running blade, than a wobbly blade with a laser guide."
2,Good Retrofit Product but not dependable.,"This is a great idea. It was easy to attach to my Craftsman miter saw with the factory bolt. I had to open it up and bend the centrifugal switch contact to make it more sensitive. This is right next to the battery so it was easy. Note, it is not bright enough to be used outdoors.9/29/2012: This product died a couple of years ago. Good idea, but not very dependable."
2,Not that accurate,"I tried this on my DeWalt 705, and found it fit fine. Mine must be one of the newer generation. The laser cuts on great and mine was very bright and clean once the blade guard started to retract. The problem is that it is off by about 1/16"" and apparently has not method for adjustment. This may be fine on a construction yard, but the whole reason I wanted this was for precise repeatable cuts.I'm afraid I'm going to have to return it, and hope that the next generation has some adjustment mechanism."
1,"Extraordinary music, pathetic video","As always, the live performance of Laura Pausini's music is energetic and absorbing. But don't consider buying this dvd if you were actually intending to see Laura Pausini in concert. Virtually no shot lasts longer than a second and most are shot from moving cameras. The viewer is continually disoriented, and somewhat frustrated. Typically there are four or five shots of the band (or the crowd, or the statium or whatever) for every quick glimpse of Laura. It is almost unwatchable.It was obviously an incredible concert--the video is a travesty. If you want to hear the music, buy the audio cd. If you want to see her in concert, buy the 2002 World Tour. In the meantime, one can only hope that they will re-release the concert video edited by someone less inept."
2,Laura Pausini's MIA,I was disappointed by this video's overall production. Cameras rarely focus on Laura for more than 5 seconds and they move around quickly and change very often. This makes it difficult to appreciate the artist and the venue. Sound is only acceptable in two or three tracks. It must have been an incredible concert and unfortunately this video doesn't portray the artist or the environment well.
5,Singin in the Rain,"Live in San SiroYou gotta love Laura!! She releases a single in Spanish, and the Latin Grammies can't wait to have her appear. The World Music Awards can't wait to reward her for Yo Canto.Now she's outdone herself. This DVD is the most amazing combination of great music and downright incredible devotion, to and from her fans.If you like Laura, you will LOVE the music, the elemental beauty of a great star at her best, and just plain good vibes form many thousands of devoted fans. Her band is sensational, and this DVD is just wonderful."
4,LAURA PAUSINI-LIVE IN SAN SIRO,"It's been a great purchase, Laura Pausini is amazing in live...As far as the logistics are concerned,I was surprise of their fast delivery even if I was said that would take a month to come to Spain..."
5,Perfect..Amazon is wrong,These locks DO fit 2010 Mercedes C300 despite the Amazon tool. They are a must with any Benz wheels...less you be separated from them.
3,Ok but..,"Anticipating a better album, I found this one to be in the middle. It isn't really bad or good just average. Some of the songs on the album like More & More and some other songs are ok, but More & More wasn't even written by Joe. I was expecting him to at least have like 7 to 10 songs he wrote on this album, but theres only like 3! What is going on I don't know, I just think he should write his own stuff like he use to. Come on Joe gives the feeling when you came out with All that I am or My Name is Joe. If joe does what he was doing before (i.e. All That I am album) then he will defintely do better, but for now its just plain."
3,Nice CD With 2 R.Kelly Remakes..,"This CD ('And Then...') is for serious fans of Joe. There's nothing special about 'And Then..' when compared to his past projects except for maybe the 2 R.Kelly remakes. I'm referring to 'More & More' and 'Make You My Baby', which were ORIGINALLY recorded by R.Kelly for the cancelled 'Loveland' CD (most Kelly fans already own 'Loveland' as a bootleg). Joe does a great job with these 2 songs, and Kelly even produced them. Since Joe's vocals are close to (if not better than) R.Kelly's, this was a great combination. Another track of note is 'Ride Wit U', which features today's Rap 'flavors of the moment', G-Unit & 50 Cent.My verdict, Joe has a formula, and sticks to it with this CD. Get this CD cheap!"
3,A collection of slow jams!,"When it comes to slow jams there are few artists out there that can beat Joe, once again he's made a beautiful album full of soft slow jams. His voice perfectly fits in to the music and it's very pleasant listening. ""Sweeter then sugar"" ""Jeep"" and ""Testify"" are examples of good tracks, ""Ride with me"" includes 50 cent and his G-unit but it's far from a rough song even if includes rap, it's kind of slow aswell. There are no uptempo songs on the album though, i enjoyed the remix of ""Stutter"" some years ago, but here we find a album full of slow jams. I suppose you buy the album for the purpose of slow comfortable songs but a little more variation would have been fun, cause we all know that Joe is capable of singing diffrent songs too. Some people even compare him with R. Kelly but i would say that Joe is a more ginuine slow jam singer, anyway a good album once again that won't make you dissapointed."
3,Decent Album 3 1/2stars,"Overall, not a bad effort. Pretty consistent with his previous material. I do think that his lyrics and song topics could be better. His vocal quality is still there though. There were a couple of cuts that I didn't particularly care for, however, this is a decent album."
4,Never Ceases to Amaze,"Quite simply, the continuation of the essence of Joe and what he brings to R&B in many aspecs remains positive in quality!"
5,Can't Wait For Album Number Six,"After ten years in the music industry Joe has this incredible piece of work to end a decade. With songs like ""Make You My Baby"", ""More&More"" and ""Bedroom"" Just to name a few.I enjoy the album from top to bottom,but I have to say that, my favorite tracks on the album are ""Priceless"" and ""Bedroom"". Priceless because it's such a beautiful ballad bedroom for obvious reasons. What more can I say you will enjoy this album. Joe is a legend in the making."
4,He's back...,"After his album ""My name is Joe"" it's understandable how hard it could be to follow up an able that had such hits as ""I wanna know"", ""Table for two"", ""Thank god I found you (Remix)"", which would explain why it was hard to get into his album ""Better Days"". This album is proof that Joe is back and hotter than ever! If you looking to set the mood or have something new to get down to, this is the album your looking for!"
4,One of the best album from JOE,"Listening to the songs in the cd, I am hooked on it! The song, ""another used to be"" is incredible, I can listen to this song from morning to night. Well done JOE!! Must song for Valentine's!!! I prefer Joe's sentimental voice especially listening to his slow songs!! This CD is a must have!! But of course having a mixture of r&b won't hurt either, but his slow songs are one of the best!"
3,Boring Dissapointment,"The fact that Joe had to cover R. Kelly more than once is indicative of his lack creativity and search for an identity. I was a pretty big Joe fan, but after just one listen I basically forgot where I put the CD. Once the G-Unit cut began to catch some shine on radio, I figured I would take a second listen, but overall, the album does nothing for me. If you take R. Kelly and G-Unit off the album all you have is a demo tape. Okay, so maybe it's not really that bad, but all-in-all, it's a boring dissapointment."
3,3 1/2 stars,"Joe - And Then... (Jive, 2004)This album isn't selling as much as it should be (just now getting recognition because of ""Ride With U"" featuring G Unit and for Joe in turn guest-starring on their ""Wanna Get to Know You"") but longtime Joe fans like myself shouldn't be too disappointed. The two R. Kelly songs from his shelved Loveland, ""More and More"" and ""Make You My Baby"", are nicely redone and Joe makes them his own songs. Still, the best song has to be ""Another Used to Be"", a lovely ballad. Joe does fall victim to trying too hard to be ""hip"" by singing about his whips, diamonds, and crushing (like in the otherwise tolerable ""It Ain't Like That""), and ""Street Dreams"" is straight-up garbage. He shines the brightest on ballads, without all of the slang. -EJR"
2,Very Disappointed!!!!!,"Joe you never used any of R Kelly's material before so why now? I just think that you could have done a better job then this. Better Days was so much better then this crap. You are my dog and I just wanna keep it real.... but this is the first flop you recorded so I guess you are intitaled to have 1 flop, but please keep on writing your own music and songs...you are too talented to use R. Kelly's used material. Get back in the studio quick and give me some of that Joe Vibe because this CD sucks. Sorry but I have to keep it real!!!!!"
2,Quite disappointing,"Been a JOE fan since the very beginning and this CD just doesn't live up to the quality we have become used to from this talented artist. The lyrics sound similar to almost every other ""bump and grind"" R&B/Hip hop album out there. JOE's trademark lies in his distinctive lyrical composition, the ""feel-good"" quality and fresh perspective...this album simply decends into cliches. As much as we all enjoy sex and nice things, I don't particularly feel inspired by an album where almost every song is about sex and material goods. I hope the next album gets back to giving us more of what we like...substance!"
4,A good album to a collection,"I've always been a fan of Joe, he's got the traditional RnB voice and this album is great work from him. But that might just be the problem, he doesn't stray far from his working formula it's the same stuff in a different package if you know what i mean. It remains a good cd to add to ur collection and certainly not something you should pass on."
5,"This is the ""Old Joe""","This is what I'm talkin'bout. No offense to Joe's skills but I thought his last CD really lacked that ""Joe"" flavor we all know and love. With this album the very first single smacks you in the face with Joe's old style of singing. This CD is really nice. For those who think he should not have collaborated with other artist, please get with the times. Other artist brings flavor to a project that the singer may lack (even though Joe is a fabulous singer). It's all about appealing to the masses to make that record sell and by far R Kelly and the other writers on the album brings that appeal to the masses."
5,It all started with Joe!,"Joe is probably my fav RnB artist. Well one of them anyway lol. I like when he sings about romance and love, not about cheating, partying, sex, being a player etc. his voice will make anything he sings about sound good. I hope he keeps his great music coming because RnB may be dying but artists like Joe, Tank, Tyrese, Musiq Soulchild, keep it alive and well. Support good musicians your artists by PURCHASING their music or we won't have anything new to enjoy any more."
5,Super sexy!,This is his best album to date! I love his voice and his stage perfomance isn't bad either! Always a fan!
2,JOE AT HIS WORST,"Ive been a Joe fan, when I thought i was the only one. I love his voice and chocolate skin and his music. This albulm was a serious dissapointment. Usually I'd bang his joints over and over and years after their debute, but after listening to this one I had to wonder if he'd be willing to give up his hard core fans for the teeny boppers. If so...ill be boot legging his joints from now on. Cuz CD's costs more than I make in an hour. Please JOE dont lose your soul over the glitter and gold."
2,2 stars for now....giving another chance....,"My husband and I are JOE fans....we have all of his work including his videos on DVD....so we're into him...no doubt. But he and I both are not feeling this new album. The 1st song? When I heard it? I just smiled and shook my head with pleasure. But then when I heard the rest of the album I just wasn't feeling it. But I won't give up on Joe....I refuse to believe that the 1st song is the only song. So, I'm trying it again this week and I'll let you all know."
2,always Been a Low-Budget R.Kelly,"and nothing wrong with that Becuase R.kelly been Holding the game for well over a Decade.I mean there is nothing wrong with that.Joe is a Very Talented Brother,but He seems kinda there most of the time.glad that Joe asked the King for a couple of Tracks from ""LOVELAND"" ""More&More;""&""Make you My baby"". Joe said in 02 on BET Tonight that He wanted to do a MARVIN Gaye ""What's Going On"" Type of Project but I think Jive Told Him we need a Hit. His Last album tanked kinda&was; weak.this Album is Better but He is caught up in what is going on now.He is a Talented Cat.Joe to Me is a cross between R.Kelly,Babyface&Brian; Mcknight. He has elements of all three in Him,but still hasn't escaped there influence on Him fully&never; has quite found His Own bag yet.but to Joe's Credit He has been around a Decade&that; still counts for something in the ever Fast-Food Mentality of that Industry."
2,Mr No Personality fails to deliver again,"Joe - although a talented singer - proves yet again that he has NO personality nor significant status in the R&B game.Anyone whos a true R&B fan would have sure to have heard R Kellys Leaked Loveland Bootleg - well Joe simply rerecords these songs, substituting Robert's name for Joe.Songs like 'Making you my baby' and 'More and More' are covered and sound exactly the same.NOT WORTH THE MONEY"
2,Note to Joe: Get your own style,"Before I even begin with the review, I have been a Joe fan for a while and for the most part he has come through with good music. My high regard for Joe changed when I saw him in concert on the Ladies Night Out tour. He was in fact the weakest performance of the show and they had the nerve to save him for last as if he were the best.At any rate, this new CD only further cements the idea that it is a wrap for Mr. Joe. Of the 13 tracks there are only 3 decent songs which include ""You dropped your dime"", ""Rid wit U"" and the refurbished R.Kelly tune ""More & More"". Speaking of which, did Joe really think that he could just change the line from "" All you gotta do is say please stay Robert"" to ""All you gotta do is say please stay Joe"" and no one would notice?? I am so tired of the blatant style biting going on these days. Save your money folks or just go out and get the REAL R. Kelly CD."
1,This is offensive!,"I can't believe a bad like Ugly Kid Joe could put out such a miserable album such as this. First, it has to be offensive to African Americans by putting a good looking black male on the front. What were they thinking???? Then the content is nothing like their great old albums, Motel California, & Menace To Sobriety. What a change in direction. As disappointing as it is to me, I hope this brings a larger audience. They are truly deserving of their fame.Peace, Love and Happiness!"
1,Words cannot describe how truly bad this movie is....,"In looking over the video shelves my husband and I chanced upon this video and thought it looked interesting. It started off with that REALLY low budget kind of filming, followed by really horrible dialog. Still thinking it was kind of cheesy but sort of interesting we continued to watch as Palmer and his buddy Pearl drive cross country taking a crate (that they have been told not to open) to Florida. This movie is bad on so many levels I wouldn't know where to begin. Let's just say, it is not worth your time. Take the 110 minutes and read a book or watch a good movie. It isn't even good as a cheesy, goofy road trip movie. It's just plain bad....that's why you've never heard anything about it and why there are no reviews on the box. Pass this one up....Walk on by and keep going. Trust me."
1,yuk,This has to be the worst movie Ive ever seen in my life.This movie was so bad I had to throw it away.This movie isnt worth watching till the very end to see what was in the crate they were hauling...
5,hot contemporary zydeco,"Rosie and her band lay down some really hot zydeco tracks. Bought the CD after hearing ""Do That Thing"" on a Chicago rock station and was not disappointed. Rosie has a great voice and plays groove laden accordian. The band is real tight with the rhythm section deep in the pocket and tasteful guitarwork. The songs are fun and funky...this will make a great gift for a music lover. Highly recommend this CD for purchase...it is the best new CD that i have heard in quite some time."
4,"Works great, doesn't burn up my batteries","It is a little thicker than I think it needs to be, but length and width couldn't be much smaller. I think it's fine and I have no more trouble finding space for this than any other batter charger I have... and I have quite a few (2 cell phones, 3 digital cameras, digital movie camera etc) I like having a stand alone battery charger so I don't have to plug in my camera and wait for it to charge. I can have one battery in my camera and the other in the charger, so it's ready when I need it and my camera is never out of commission."
3,Big and clumsy.,"The unit is big and clumsy, has a long cord -- so it is difficult to store on a shelf or in a drawer. However, it does the job. Pentax should look at the chargers used by Panasonic and others for a clue."
5,Great printer for the price,I needed to replace my old Epson Stylus 777 printer and wanted just a basic printer to use to print out documents. The HP 5440 is great at what it does and I would recommend it to anyone.
1,Highest cost per page printer on market,"This printer forces you to use only the HP92 and HP93 5ml cartridges, even though HP makes the same physical cartridges in larger yield models (HP94, HP95, HP96, HP97, and HP98). The printer only accepts the lowest yield cartridges.Figure this: If you had an older HP printer that used the standard HP45A cartridge.... that cartridge held 42ml of black ink and costs $30. This model uses the HP92A which holds 5ml of black ink for $20. So if you buy 8 of the HP92 cartridges ($160 worth) you still don't have as much ink as the $30 HP42A cartridge. This works out to an extremely high cost per page.It also only uses a 5ml color cartridge. You can buy a canon printer for the same price that uses 3 individual cartridges per color that hold 13ml each (39ml total color), which equals out to a much lower cost per page."
3,2 YEAR DISPOSABLE PRINTER,THIS PRINTER WILL LAST 2 YEARS AND WORK GREAT DURING THAT TIME. IN THE MONTHS THAT FOLLOW IT WILL CONSTANTLY HAVE PAPER JAMS AND THEN IT WILL JUST QUIT WORKING ALL TOHGETHER. I AM STILL LOOKING FOR A BASIC HOUSEHOLD PRINTER THAT WILL LAST 5 YEARS MINIMUM AND PRINT ONLY IN AFFORDABLE BLACK AND WHITE. I AM DOUBTFUL THAT HP WILL EVER MAKE IT WHEN THEY CAN SELL DISPOSABLE PRINTERS TO MAKE THE COMPANY MORE MONEY.
2,Houston we have a problem,"Lasted for about 2 years until it keeps having paper jam every time I try to print something. I'm looking for another printer now.Good Points (During the first year of use): Good Picture Quality. Quieter than my previous Canon.Bad Points: Takes up a lot of ink it seems, but the cartridges aren't all that expensive though. Kinda slow if you do normal printing. After a year's use, it starts to get paper jam often. Now, it jams everytime I print."
2,Great low cost printer..too expensive to supply,"As almost everyone else has said, this printer does a great quality print job whether printing text and graphics or printing photos. I am dismayed however at the extremely, repeat, extremely high cost per page. This is due to the tiny amount of ink in the cartridges and the very high cost of ink. Although Walgreens and others will refill these at about half the price of a new cartridge, it is still not a reasonable cost per page. I would not recommend any HP for this reason alone. They, and Epson both make great, low cost printers but what good is a well priced printer if you can't afford to supply it?"
1,Complete piece of junk,"Unpacked it, fired it up, and started printing. No problems at all...until after I had printed a few pages. Then the black ink stopped printing. I tried EVERYTHING to get it flowing again. There was plenty of ink in the cartridge; it just wouldn't print black anymore. I could chalk this up to a freak incident, but in fact the only reason I got this printer in the first place was to replace my previous HP printer, which had precisely the same problem. No way is this just a coincidence. I'll never buy another HP again."
1,Awful,The mouse does not work well after a few days no matter how many times you ask the manufacturer to replace it. I recommend looking for other wireless products.
2,"Not a very good bluetooth mouse, PC users beware...cheap design and not very good overall value","I really needed a bluetooth mouse for my Media Center and didnt have a lot of options I could find that had a ball design. I will return and hopefully get my money back from this Amazon seller. Going to try a logitech next time, if you need a great bluetooth key board I would recommend the Logitech DiNova edge...it has a built in mouse pad which is great for just controlling the media center but tiring to use as the sole mouse if you are doing any work on the computer. Hence the reason I needed a seperate bluetooth mouse. Stay away from the laser if you are sitting on the couch and there is any distance between you and the box, not enough range. Bluetooth works great however..."
2,What's happened to Minnetonka?,"I owned a pair of Minnetonka Moccasins for about 20 years before they finally gave out. (The sole ripped at the toe). I LOVED those moccasins - I wore them everywhere. I am not averse to ordering cheaper versions of popular styles, but in this case I was very clear that I wanted to order the Minnetonka brand. Although the shoes arrived on time and as ordered, the sole separated from the leather within one week of regular wear. When I looked at it, I realized the ""stitching"" between the sole and shoe body was ornamental and the sole was actually glued on. Although I reglued it and continued to wear them, they started to scuff immediately and, when I tried to clean them, found that they were not shining up like real leather, but peeling like leather blend. This was a terrible disappointment to me and I'll be looking for a new brand of shoe. Why pay more to get poor quality? Shame on Minnetonka."
1,Beware Peltz return policy,"Beware this seller return policy. I have worn Minnetonka Deerskin moccasins many times over the years. They are always soft and comfortable. I wear a size 9 and have very narrow feet.These moccasins are well made, but they must be mis sized or seconds. They would never fit a medium width foot as they barely fit my narrow foot. I requested a 10 as maybe this would help.This seller return policy is not user friendly to say the least. The most troublesome is a 20.00 restocking fee. Policy states that shoes must be returned exactly as shipped. No problem EXCEPT moccasins had a handmade narrow band of white tissue paper around them which must be removed to try on and could never be replaced as it is. The company will not do an exchange. You must buy another size and hope they refund original cost. One has difficulty believing that the entire policy and white band of tissue is meant to STOP exchanges. I have NEVER written any reviews previously.I feel cheated by this company"
4,"Soft, and a decadent treat for your feet.","It's not as light as the picture states, it's a bit darker...but the feel of the leather is sensational. If's too tight, don't worry, the leather stretches a bit with wear."
2,Did not meet my expectations,"The quality was fine, but felt sticky on my feet. Perhaps I would have been happier if there was some type of lining. I felt bad, but had to return them as I knew it would never be comfortable on my feet. Sorry to say, I guess I have a problem with skin contact with deerskin."
5,Wonderful!,I LOVE these shoes. Minnetonka is a great brand and produce good quality items. I bought another pair of moccasins in black to have from them because I was so in love.
5,Soft,Not the stereotypical shoe woman. These are soft and attractive. enough. Not too much. I like the slip on comfortable style and different material. Keep making different styles and focus on comfort.
2,Buyer beware,"I don't plan to buy this edition of the Logic, because when I used ""look inside this book"" I found that the page images showed handwritten markings by an earlier reader. When I buy *used* books I insist that they be in ""very good"" condition, which means no page markings. I certainly don't expect new and somewhat costly books to contain markings. I fear that with things like Googlebooks we will increasingly face this problem. Caveat Emptor!"
5,review by the artist,"the supposed review by ed roland makes no sense. this lyrics of the song don't really reflect that at all. plus, from all the things i've read about the band over the years, they would never just come out and say that this song is about this...that defeats the whole purpose. people who write songs want the listener to interpret their own meaning.none the less, this is an unbelievable song...the musicianship is top notch, with the layering of acoustic guitars, classical background, and an electric solo. one of my all time favorite songs."
4,Excellent action / comedy,"Shark in a Bottle is a surprisingly good little film that features strong performances from Danny Nucci and Tiny Lister. The most pleasant surprise is Ben Gazarra in the bad guy role of the Arranger, head of an assassin for hire business. He hasn't been this evil since Roadhouse."
3,Interesting facts presented in a repetitive way,"This is a nice summary of yet another 10 secrets of Bill Gates' success. I did find out something new for myself. However, the book itself is awfully repetitive. It seems like the chapters were written in dissonance as you read the same words over again like a constant deja vu which is somewhat annoying. Overall, not a bad book!"
2,NEC 2005 Handbook of limited value,"I have had my master electrician license for 21 years but needed to study for a master license in another state. I have been an electrical contractor and state electrical inspector. I studied for about 100 hours using the regular codebook and I used this ""handbook"" as a reference. I was very disappointed in that almost every single time I had a question or something was unclear there was absolutely no reference to the ""complex"" issue. It seemed like the obvious was explained in ""other words"" but the hard stuff was ignored. I realize ""hard stuff"" is subjective and my review acknowledges that. In this handbook the simplistic issues are reiterated or a picture is shown which is probably great for beginners or apprentices. I'm not sure why there is almost no clarification or examples regarding the more complicated code issues and almost no useful load, feeder or building service calculations. I would recommend not relying on this book if you want to pass a master test."
5,A lot better than the standard NEC,"This handbook made the NEC more interesting to read. It thoroughly explains most of the vague notes written in the standard NEC book. It does so with examples, actual applications through colored illustrations. Since I'd like to get the most bang out of my buck, I'll consider buying the handbook every other revision."
2,For Die Hard Melvins fans Only,"I have this on VHS.This comes off as something slightly better than a bootlegged show. A two camera setup may be a step above normal bootleg quality but the third camera, (stationary, above the drums) provides less than perfect picture.For the MELVINS completist, I'd say go for it. Casual fans may want to borrow a friends' copy."
5,A poem style text laced with barbed wit,"In Daddy I Wanna Be A Lawyer: And Makes Lots Of Money is witty satire on the usual career descriptive books about being a lawyer which is the usual fare for children. Author Larry Goldfarb offers a poem style text laced with barbed wit and enhanced with simple illustrations as the yearnings of ten-year-old Rodney wanting to become a trial lawyer like his father and abuse the judicial system for personal profit are laid bare for all to see. Pointedly funny from first page to last, Daddy I Wanna Be A Lawyer is especially recommended reading for anyone who has ever dreamed of being a lawyer -- or has a kid who does."
2,This is a edited version of the film!,"This version is missing some scenes from the Video release, as well as the theatre release. It also has seveal scenes moved around. if you dont believe me, go rent the video copy! You are missing a funny sequence with a gay driver who picks up dolemite and the gang on their way to California! Its in the video version, but missing in the DVD copy. Also certain scenes involving miss Cavarelli and the infamous ladies room scene is moved to a differnt section. This isnt the first time Xenon DVD did this to their release, so beware when buying!"
2,Big time disapointed,"I just loved the 1st one but the sequel was just too slow, not very funny and had lost it's charm. It just has a few memorable scenes."
1,Why did I get this?,A friend of mine while having a couple beers had mentioned seeing this movie years ago and this it hillarious. Well I found it on Amazon and decided to buy it for him. We sat and watched this monstrosity and i his taste in films must of changed with age. I can understand it being a goofball superhero comedy and I've seen a few of those in my day but this was way out there. I chuckled a couple times but we never got through half the film. Not my dish of soul food
3,crossties,"First of all, I was totally disgusted with Lisa for not including her parents in her college decisions. Even with scholarships, who the heck is paying for the brunt of it? Anyway, she visits her father in California, hoping to get away from her mother, who has a twentysomething boyfriend, but finds things only become more complex when her brother arrives. Meanwhile Carole beomces involved in a community service project and finally starts behaving in a likeable fashion."
4,2 cents,its cool. I hope Lisa and Alex get back together. She dosnt soud rite withe Scott. Skye had his chance. good book nust read
5,One of my favorite Pine Hollow books,"Cross- Ties is my second fovorite book in the Pine Hollow series.Only next only to ""Reining In"".I really liked this book cause it had Skye Ransom in it.Ive always like Skye and thought that Bonnie would have him and Lisa hook up.Instead she had Lisa hook up with Alex.In this book you could really tell that Lisa has deeper feelings for Skye then before. Skye we already knew that he liked Lisa more then a friend.Then when Lisa and Skye meet up and they talk you can tell that they can reallt talk to one another.Then when Skye leaves and he kisses Lisa what does that tell you?They would be perfect for each other.so why couldnt they have Lisa date Skye rather then Alex and then Scott?I really enjoyed this book I m just mad like some others to why Bonnie onlt had 17 books in the series."
3,Question,"Okay, I thought this book was alright...but am I out of it or in the Saddle Club books, wasn't Lisa an only child? Do they explain somewhere where her brother came in and I just missed it? This college thing is totally unlike Lisa, but why don't her parents listen to her? I did like this book and I do want to read more sometime."
4,Well-Crafted Cozy,"I have to admit that cozies are not my favorite mysteries. I find them overly cute and lacking in character development.This novel by Carolyn Hart follows in that tradition, but I have to admit the writer did an admirable job of crafting this mystery. She has a lot going on here--a double murder, a suicide and a disappearance, and a domestic murder and acquittal. All these cases appeared in the past. Now throw in a contemporary murder of the reporter writing a followup on these cases, and the plot does indeed thicken.Did she tie up everything in a way that satisfied the reader? Not totally, but still I have to admit that I was compelled to continue reading. I especially liked the university setting and the mixing of the past and present.If you like cozies, I highly recommend this book. If you don't like cozies, this book might grate on your nerves a bit."
1,Carolyn Hart's writing style is difficult for me to read.,"I was so excited to acquire this book, and I am so disappointed now. It is so difficult to read. I love Sherlock Holmes mysteries and works by Agatha Christie and Sharyn McCrumb. I recently read a Nancy Pickard that was o.k. At least it was readable. But what's the deal with Carolyn Hart. Does anyone share my view?"
1,Death in Lover's Lane,"This is the first of Hart's Henrie O mysteries that I've read, and likely the last. It took me forever to really get into, and I finished it only because I almost always finish books. There were too many characters--I kept thinking, ""now, who is that?"". I didn't identify with any of them, just not memorable. There were several clues to a perpetrator throughout the book, but none panned out. There was no ""ah-hah"" moment, when the reader would think ""ok, I've got it"" or, even better, ""why didn't I see that?"". So, as far as mysteries go, no real intrigue."
4,The greyhound is on the loose.,"I have been a ""Henrie O"" fan since she was introduced in Dead Man's Island. What a gal! The silver fox does it again. She's tough, independent, believes in fair play, and doesn't back down. Maggie's death opened up the proverbial can of worms. Little did Maggie's murderer know that Henrie O would be the fish that devoured the worm. This book showcases human emotions at their weakest. Greed, lust, hate and fear all took their turn. Even though there are four crimes, they are woven together into a common strand. The past and present are brought together for a final showdown.Another one (or is it four) for the geritol greyhound."
3,"Good, but not the highest quality","Complex plot (three mysteries, no four, three old, one current). The reporter/teacher/sleuth Henrie O succeeds in solving all four fairly satisfactorily. The story-telling is excellent; the actual plot, events, and twists are rather far-fetched. Hard to imagine that one journalism school student and one teacher could solve three mysteries which police couldn't (though, truthfully, one was solved, and one was officially covered up ~ covered up by officials, anyway), getting murdered and solving the murder respectively in the process. Still, one could probably make that complaint about many mystery novels, including the Mistress, Agatha Christie, to whom Carolyn Hart is unwisely compared in a series of quoted reviews which form the back cover blurb."
3,Cute box with supplies,"The picture shows exactly what you are getting. Be aware that the items are plastic and very small. It makes a cute decoration, but I can't imagine my daughter actually ""playing"" with any of these items. Still it is very cute and for $7 it was worth a decoration for her barn."
5,Breyer Grooming Kit is not a bad Brand!!!,THIS BREYER KIT IS NOT A BAD BRAND! IF YOU DON'T KNOW A IDOIT WOULD KNOW THAT BREYER STUFF IS BREACKABLE IT IS FOR COLLECTORS AND IT DOES BREACK BUT IT IS A GOOD BRAND!!!!! AND THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH BREYER!!
1,Very disappointed,The worst online purchase I have ever made. The item was poorly made and packaged for the brand name only. I would never buy anything from this company again. A total rip-off.
4,Grooming Kit,"I think that this is a great grooming kit, and it shows you some grooming items. However, you might want to consider being careful with it, as some parts are fragile. If you have a collection of Breyers, this would be a nice addition."
3,well...,"These parts are really cool and realistic, but they are very very tiny. And you have to be gentle with the curry and the hoofpick because they bend. It looks like it was designed to be a toy but makes a better prop."
5,Excellent Tool!,"I used Dr Neimarks tape prior to undergoing Gastric Bypass Surgery. I believe that it helped me immeasurably. Not only was my pain level very managable, but I left the hospital a day early. My recovery has been nothing short of remarkable! Thanks Dr Neimark!"
4,"Good read, better than some out there.","I bought this book to get my monthly romance fix and found this book pretty good. Gail Barrett could have done without the graphic sex descriptions but the rest of the book was great. Wade: the misunderstood and shunned kid from the wrong side of the tracks and Erin: the rich girl abandoned by her mother and taken in by her ailing grandmother. If we all had one friend like Erin, who believed in us and had our backs we could see less troublemakers and more successful men like Wade turned into. This book tackles issues of stereotyping and how hard it is to let go of pride sometime and accept help. I think this created more realistic situations and created sympathy for the characters. These two characters are likable and believable and easier to relate to. Grab a box of chocolate and enjoy this romantic book!"
4,A wonderful love story,"Where He Belongs by Gail BarrettSilhouette Special Edition #1722 - November 2005This is Gail Barrett's debut with Harlequin, and I found it to be a wonderful love story. Our hero grew up on the wrong side of town but had always found acceptance from the heroine and her family. When Wade returns home to be with his gravely ill stepfather, he's forced back into Erin's life, the girl he left behind and could never forget. The chemistry between them is stronger than ever. Wade soon agonizes over how he'll be able to leave Erin behind again. The scene and events that lead up to Wade's realization that he truly doesn't want to leave Erin are very well done. Erin is a strong woman, who has her own vulnerabilities to face from her past. I'm looking forward to reading more from Ms. Barrett!"
3,"good content, poor editing","My father was a combat engineer who fought in the Bulge, and so I was excited to read this book. Some of the content appears to be the recollections of Col. Pergrin. Much of it appears to be stories of others that are here conveyed by him. Sometimes it ties together, and sometimes it doesn't. Telling the entire story of the Bulge is a complex matter, yet a thorough edit could have chopped out much of the redundancy, fixed some of the grammatical problems, and helped smooth the flow of the text. Col. Pergrin has provided a valuable service in preserving and organizing the content, but it is not the book for someone looking for an easy read."
3,Member of ECB WW2,Serious mistake in not having an index.Content of book good.Col. Pergrin an excellent commander during those difficult times.
4,nice,It's a fun toy my son loved it. Needs more molds and goo but nice nevertheless would recommend to others if ou like bugs
2,Not good for ferrets,I bought these to help me potty train my ferret.On the plus side- he likes them and they smell goodDownsides- Ferrets cannot digest anything other than meat protein and these treats have corn/corn syrup/glycerin and wheat. None of these things are good for ferrets and can actually lead to disease later in life. I've switched to Ferretone and cooked chicken as a treat.
1,The ferrets like them but it has an unfortunate effect on their digestion.,"My ferrets enjoyed these and ate them greedily. So much so that they all got explosive diarrhea. At first, I attributed this to my allowing them to eat four or five treats at the same time, so I started feeding them the treats one at a time. This helped some but still caused loose stools. Since I had five ferrets at the time (one has since passed away), and they all demonstrated the same effect, I doubt it is specific to individuals."
1,"i didn't read well i guess, my fault maybe?","But these are soft and in a very small bag. I though i was buying a harder treat to chew on and that wasnt swallowed instantly. Its probably not a ""bad"" product but not what I thought I was buying."
1,My Ferret's won't touch these!,"Better to spend the $5 on a cardboard tube for your pet to crawl through, ferrets will get a lot more enjoyment out of that. My Ferret's won't touch these treats! The ""Bandits"" smell bad and my fuzzy critters turn up their little furry noses at them. However, they will do almost anything for one single Cheerio... and a box of Cheerios lasts forever! Better to save your money for something they will really enjoy."
5,Great knife,"This is a great all around pocket knife, the right size and heft. It has the Buck name which stands for quality. I had a broken blade on my other Muskrat and sent it to Buck and they sent me this knife."
