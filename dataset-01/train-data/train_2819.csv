1,Could be more useful,"It is ironic that a book that is promoting loving communication can be so alienating. Perhaps a book that is more secular in nature would be more helpful. I just want this recognized for what it is: Pop-psychology, couched in language so it is very palatable to a specific sub-segment of our society. This book is not and should not be pitched as the be-all-and-end-all of relationship communication books.While it is helpful to a certain degree to recognize different styles in communication, language like ""filling up your love meter"" is an oversimplification of some very complex issues between individuals. I do not like language that can be used to trivialize and to dismiss important issues within a relationship."
5,FANTASTIC PURCHASE,The product was delivered in a timely manner and without any damage. The audio CD's are great for my fiance. He listens to them on his way to and from work. There is alot of practical advice and relates lessons to real life couples and their situations to better understand the art of relationships. Gary Chapman speaks as though he was a friend having a conversation with you. We are very pleased with the purchase and will listen to it a few times I am sure.
5,Great guide for a healthy relationship,"This is a great CD set for men looking to work on their relationship with their wife. Some of the examples are a little hokey, but the sentiment behind it is what matters. Dr. Chapman's southern accent and charm comes through as he reads his own work.Very easy to get through several chapters in the car when you are able to give this your full attention."
5,What you didn't know about love and relationship.,"This is a excellant book on love and relationship. If I had only picked up this book before my devorce. I makes sense and it works, people will respond to you in a positive manner. I've given many of these books as wedding gifts. This will show you how to express love in a whole new light."
4,Good Suggestions,I got this book in hopes of finding ways my hubby and I can connect. He read this book really fast and I'm still reading a couple of chapters at a time. Although the suggestions are good and we are using them to mend some issues in our relationship; it wasn't something that I just couldn't put down like hubby. For overall content I give kudos.
5,Great Relationship book,This is a Great relationship book for the young and old. Give you an understanding of how your past and present relationship. It will also be helpful on your future relationship. Can't wait to wait to read other similar books.
5,It's helped a lot,"This book is great...my husband and i had been arguing and fighting every three days non stop about some of the simplest thing, after reading this book it gave me a better insight into how he may be thinking and why he does some of the things i find well a bit irritating. He also read the book and found out that i was a quality time person not a acts of service here he was doing everything he thought i would appreciate instead of taking time to just spend talking to me or taking a simple walk together. I highly recommend this book to couples who aren't sure what's going on in their relationship...it can help if not a little."
4,Very Helpful,"Although this says ""Men's Edition"" it is really meant for both men and women. My husband finished the book before I did. We are practicing the suggestions from the author and within a couple weeks we are happier with each other. Easy to read and follow, practical guide I highly recommend this book for couples who find themselves looking for a better relationship."
1,"Same book, different wrapper","If you've already read ""The Five Love Languages,"" don't waste your money since it's the exact same book with minor changes in print style to make it more ""masculine."" There are a few minor additions at the end of each chapter, focusing his recommendations more to the men's point of view. However, billing this as a separate edition is nothing more than false advertisement."
2,Not a gem,"So theres this show ""Amour"" and the music sounds really good, but when the lyrics and story line get added in, it should never have gone to broadway. There is nothing redeeming about the... stupidness of the plot. Not even funny stupidness. But like I said the music is actually quite nice. This is STRICTLY a show for collectors, Legrand fans, and people looking for flops. Sometimes flops can be fun, but this one isnt. This is a disapointment for the amount amazon charges. Favorite song (I do this in all my reviews): ""An Ordinary Guy"""
5,Season 5 News!,Even better news.....tvshowsondvd.com just released the news that Taxi the final season (season 5) will be released around Dec. 22nd!!! Just in time for xmas!
4,"The unkindest cuts, indeed","As another reviewer has written, there's a missing scene in one episode where Jim plays the piano. And yes, you can see a snippet of that scene in the closing credits. I suspect it's because there's music involved and the DVD producers didn't want to pay for the rights. I'm also almost 100 percent certain that another snippet is missing in the episode where Louie catches a mouse and releases it off-camera at the end of the episode. I could swear that episode ends with him singing just a few words from ""Born Free."" The most-notorious DVD butchery was the WKRP DVD set, which I never bought. This set is not nearly as bad because so little music is used apart from Bob James' wonderful score. I haven't finished watching Season Four yet. I'm hoping these two cheap cuts are the extent of the edits. Be warned."
1,Ominously negative start,"I've wanted this season above all the others for the single episode: ""Elegant Iggy"". Very briefly, this was the episode where Elaine and Jim attend two functions, and the potential for disaster is frightfully high in Elaine's mind. It was presented , on this latest DVD release, WITHOUT the final scene where Jim plays piano and sings with Nina Van Pallandt. Why they would do this I have no idea. Perhaps the manufacturers of this set don't have access to the original film, I don't know. But I do know , after seeing one episode, that I've been shortchanged. If you doubt my claim, watch the closing credits of this episode and you'll see Jim and the character played by Nina at the piano. For shame!"
4,Edited cable version!,"Glad its out, finally, but sad to say its the edited for cable version and not the original network broadcast. Sucks but its better than nuthin."
3,Decent Space Sci-Fi,Story is well-written but I was not drawn into relating to the characters due to the writing style. Enjoyed the technology and the futuristic expansion of mankind into new universes.
3,Just ok,"The story of Antares Dawn was enjoyable and the technical details did not seem to get on the way. The main reason I give this three stars is that the characters and relationships are shallow and do nothing to engage the reader. The love story is undeveloped and anticlimactic and the change of heart by one of the characters at the end is ridiculously fake. While the storyline is promising, I do not feel inspired to continue the series."
3,Good read for a long summer night,"A good read, i've read it twice now. The plot leaves the reader wondering what happened to the crew of the derelict earthship ""Conqueror"" and goes from there. The sequal, Antares Passage is also good, but not as strong as the first. Now if only there was a third novel to find out how the war ends..."
2,Difficult to keep reading.,"I finished Gibraltar Earth which was great so I ordered this book. Man, they are night and day works. This one reads like a 1950's space novel. So at 30% read I just can't go on reading. Short version of story: Earth has colonies by way of jump ports, on one of the colonies a star goes super nova, and jump ports don't work any longer. Hundreds of years later jump ports work again, earth space ship shows up, they hurry to investigate, everyone is dead on that ship, while there told to hurry back to port after just a few hours! Hugh waste of time and fuel. Back on the planet, talk about women being part of the earth space ship crew found, men shocked at this. Is this 1950's or what. At this point I just give up reading since the story line is so bad!"
5,Excellent Off-World Sci-Fi,"This isn't a review per se, just a kudo for the author: Michael McCollum does it again. I've read just about everything by this author and have determined that he's one of the very best sci-fi authors ever. I've read this book and its sequel three times now--about once every 6 months or so since finding them. This is the kind of story that stays with me and keeps drawing me back over and over--even tho I know what's gonna happen! The broad landscape of this story is absolutely entralling, the characters are well developed and really come alive, and the physics of wormhole travel even seems plausible. Please, please someone make a movie out of this story. It would translate MOST EXCELLENTLY to the big screen."
4,Good book,"I heard about Michael McCollum via a ""Security Now"" podcast recommended by a friend. The 'casters recommended this and other McCollum books with high praise. It has good science, a good plot and good characterizations. The only complaint I have is that the author gets a bit carried away on the use of EXCLAMATION marks! I hope that later books in this series will correct that minor flaw. Well worth a read."
5,Through a glass darkly....,"John L'Heureux has a disturbing and salient view of people and their inherent foilbles. His writing always entrances, this book no exception."
4,WILL ROCK YOUR SKULL OUT!,"I don't know what this is but I like it. Is it punk, hard core, metal? I don't know yet its a rock and roll locomotive.The music is nasty, in your face, very catchy and melodic. It talks about ""dicks on a dog"" so it is also very intellectual.The liner notes are bizarre and the band members do not have names. Perfect!All the songs are very good.The cover art sums up the material perfectly...some wild caged animal breaking loose and exploding at ya. That is what this music is.I have listened to RFTC other works and this is their best. The other stuff is too punk. This is more like NY Dolls/Areosmith raunch."
2,Somebody shoot me before I buy this album AGAIN.,"Honestly, what was I thinking? The Mighty Mighty Rocket Disaster must have crashed its '68 Camarro into Planet Suburbia and gotten seriously wasted on red tips & cosmos. I know you don't care of course; you still think RFTC is the greatest thing to come out of San Diego since pink flamingoes and jujitsu. For mine own part, I can't take it anymore. I can't. Jeez Louise, the rockets were my most favoritest band in the world until the fateful day I played this record FORWARDS at the REGULAR SPEED on my tape deck and experienced a very impolite awakening. Now, Speedo isn't a completely worthless human being. There's always Jehu, and if you're looking for bargain disks I seriously recommend Reis' solo project: Back Off Cupids. Besides that, I can't help you.So why don't you kill me already?"
1,Partially Hydrogenated Oils!!! aka Trans Fats,"Be aware of the Legal Disclaimer at the bottom of this product's ingredient list. It warns that it is not fully disclosing ALL of the ingredients in Fantastic World Food's products for a reason. I had been buying this product for years from health food shelves and never thought to thoroughly read the ingredients until recently when my eyes fell upon ""partially hydrogenated soybean and cottonseed oil"" right there on the box of their Vegetarian Chili mix. This is Trans Fats, and no amount of this chemically modified fat is safe for the body! If you are trying to avoid that ingredient and looking to purchase this food based on its false health food marketing, you can verify this bad news for yourself by checking out the product in the natural food section of your store. This is a very poor business practice as they know people are avoiding trans fats like the plague... hence the legal disclosure. Inexcusable!"
1,"If I could have given it less than One star, I would have","As a martial artist with 25 plus years experience, I was skeptical..and I should have gone with my instincts. Shakbo Dak is no more than a a few beginner self defense techniques borrowed from a few different arts, such as Muay Thai, karate, and jujitsu. Nothing in the whole book is unknown to anyone with basic self defense experience. It is all hype. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone I consider a friend."
2,Not what I expected,I expected a soft chamois. This one is a bit thick and therefore not easy to use.
3,A Slight Bit Slanted But Still Somewhat Enjoyable,"""Call to Home"" tells the untold story of the remigration of African Americans back to the South. The book is written as an ethnography in a novelistic fashion. The stories told give fantastic insight into the motivation and attitudes compelling these individuals to move back ""home"". Rather than for economic reasons, Stack posits that the nostalgia of home and the love of family drive these African Americans back South.Unfortunately the stories in the book portray the men as less sentimental and as caring less for their homelands. If Stack found that this was indeed the case she ought to have postulated why. Instead the reader is left wondering if this is indeed the case or is Stacks viewpoint is somewhat slanted. (I might point out that she is a professor of Women's Studies at Berkeley). Overall, the book was very enlightening and a pleasant read."
2,A Difficult Read,"Contrary to other reviews which claim the setting isn't well wrought, I disagree. The setting is the only thing that saves this book from being a total dud. I like the setting. It's got a good sense of place; it feels real to me, and that's important. That being said, however, the work itself is bad. It's the choppiest book I've ever read. The author's brief prose works okay during the battle scenes, but it really blows when people are just sitting around and talking.. and there's a lot of that going on. Everything is so rushed, I couldn't get a good feel for the characters. They couldn't be bothered with taking to time to have a conversation of over 20 words, so why should I be bothered to care?"
2,Harald - Review,"I am a great fan of historical science fiction but I found this novel to be a real disappointment. Despite the fact that the author has written that appears to be just a recounting of battles in a contrived historical setting (no science fiction,no fantasy), he fails to make either the setting or the characters come alive.Add to this a proliferation of characters, stilted language and a lackluster plot and, as the novel progresses, it becomes more and more difficult to care about the eventual outcome."
4,"Oh, it's not so bad","Actually, I kind of like the clipped style of speech these characters have. Reminds me of Elmore Leonard's rule: leave out the stuff people skip over. In fact, my general feeling of much science fiction nowadays is that there is too much spoon feeding, too many adverbs, too much speechifying and explanation, not enough plain description of the action and letting you work out what's going on (David Weber might be an example of such excess). In order to avoid falling into their errors, I'll stop here. I liked the book."
3,A different horse,"Found for free, Baen library. Mediocre worldbuilding, go there, do that, sometimes no interim scenes. Moves fast, little descrptive text. Much dialogoue.If you like my review style I just put forward, you'll love the book. very broken and choppy, with very short sentences. I wondered if the author was trying to capture how people really talked back in that day, but then I noticed it even ran into what little scenery decription he gave. I did enjoy the story line though, almost Robert E Howard-ish, but fails to capture the readers full attention. Easy book for many to set aside."
3,wrong genre,"I obtained this from the Baen Free Library. I agree the clipped speaking style gets old fast. I don't see this book as Sci-fi, no modern weaponry, or hints that these were descendents of space travelors. I don't consider it fantasy, as there is no magic, or supernatural creatures. Maybe it would fit into alternate history, except that there's no decision point referenced. Adventure is the best I can do. Most of the chapters could be read as short stories on their own. Like others, I kept reading, waiting for something to happen, or for a burst of enlightenment, which sadly never came."
1,66cents down from $24.00 says it all,"Wouldn't David Friedman (the untrained economist) tell David Friedman (the untrained lawyer) that the demand curve eloquently says it best: ""Neither the non-economist economist Friedman nor the non lawyer law professor Friedman have 6 bits worth of talent as a science fiction novelist."
2,Disappointed,"Fisrt impressions:1. This unit is heavy...terribly heavy. Don't expect to be able to push it if the propel mechanism fails.2. This unit, with a Briggs engine, is hard to start...terribly hard to start. Expect to pull the rope 6 to 10 times...and hard.3. The chipper jammed on the third branch...one well within the size limitation of the machine. The jam made it impossible to pull the starter rope, and a MAJOR disassembly of the front end was required to free it up. This might not be the machine's fault because the branch was dry. It broke and splintered rather than being cut. I won't try to chip dried twigs and branches again.Like other Troy-bilt products I have seen (I also have an 8 HP tiller, which I will not part with), the build quality is very good.However...overall I wish I had my money back."
3,It worked great until...,"I bought this product and I used it to do a heavily wooded property. It handled the wet leaves but the twiggs and leaves clogged the inlet. I was able to unclog it with a stick. Plenty of power, for the propulsion and the chipping / vacuum. It worked great until the transmission fell off. I bought it assembled. The bolts just loosened and fell out. Somebody didn't use lock nuts. 2 yr warranty is nice. It's a week now waiting for the parts."
3,A little disappointed.,"My old chipper vac (Model 47261, 5HP) is better---a bit beefier for chipping, and easier to adjust for vacuuming, plus has reverse, and 5 or so forward speeds. This model doesn't self-feed very well for the chipper. However, the vacuum doesn't seem to clog like my old one (probably because there is no screen in this one). The self-propelling feature is useless---only one forward speed and it's too fast.This vac is best for smallish, flat, non sloping, yards, with only moderate leaf clean up required. Chipper good only for small limbs, no good for twiggy brush."
1,Terrible Machine,"Just unpacked and used the chipper/vac. Unless you are chipping straight dowel rods, forget it. It fails the chip even small 1"" branches and leaves. They bind in the shoot and you have to shut the chipper down. Things get even better when you stop it to clear the hopeless chipper. It will not restart, regardless of the effort. I am 6'-2"" and visit the gym daily, but I cannot pull this thing hard enough for it to start. Very disappointed.Run, don't walk away from this one."
4,A great machine that needs a little improvement.,"I still own one of the original machines (formally manufactured by MTD and later sold to Troy-Bilt) and its nearing the time for an engine replacement. My only complaint is the bagging system. The design is poor. The bag is made of thick felt that leaves get stuck to and after two years, it began to rip at the seams. The other problem is the grommets used in the strap that hangs the bag. They all stretched and eventually broke. I bought a few snap clips and cable to hold the bag tight to the handle bars for easy removal.To make this machine perfect the collection bag should be made of the same thick nylon mesh used for grass bags on lawnmowers. Then, use a seatbelt strap/buckle to keep the bag securely on the machine.Otherwise, its been a great machine every fall since 1998."
2,Just OK,Will not solve your problems. Only thing its good for is reducing the amount of leaf bags you need. Just as much work as raking.
2,a piece of junky plastic.,It is probably my fault for thinking that this was a real keyboard instead of just an overlay. Even so it looked junky and I would not even attempt to try it. I guess I will keep using my regular keyboard.
4,If you can't dance to this then your feet are rooted!,"Wish you were in Cuba? Then pour a rum, light a cigar, put on this disc, turn up the volume and close your eyes. If you aren't up and dancing by the end of this album then man you ain't got rhythm! This is a feel good, dance/party sound. Cubanismo have a very tight rhythm and horn section and great vocals. I recently attended a concert by Cubanismo in Taiwan. Although 99% of the people had no idea what the lyrics meant,and were probably not very familiar with this type of music the whole audience was bopping and swaying to the music throughout the concert and shouting for more at the end. They are HOT,HOT,HOT. Don't miss this band if they come to your town, a great evenings entertainment. Enjoy the disc."
3,OK,"Nothing great here. A couple of tracks swing real good, but mostly an unspectular sample of cuban music."
1,"Decent Talent, Zero Soul","While Alemañy and crew demonstrate considerable talent, they do not compare to the soulful, inspired recordings by such artists as Compay Segundo, Ibrahim Ferrer, Eliades Ochoa, and Rubén González, and such collaborative projects as Buena Vista Social Club, Afro-Cuban All Stars, and Estrellas de Areito. With all due respect, Alemañy would do well to listen more closely to the artists his CD jacket dubs as overly ""nostalgic""."
2,Could have been better,"I can't really say that it is the product itself, as my corgi had a lot of health issues, but I did not notice any change in his shedding whatsoever using this product."
1,doesn't seem to work,"I saw good reviews on this product so I thought I'd try it. I've been giving my dog four pills a day for about a month now and it just doesn't seem to be working, I have a Rat terrier that's a house dog and the shedding is the worst I've ever seen in a dog or even a cat.I will continue to give her the rest I have till they are gone in hopes that it might get better."
1,Parts were missing,I ordered this for my son-in-law for Christmas and boy was there a surprise waiting for him when he opened it. Two necessary pieces were missing from the box. It's hard to review it much further from that because it is unusable with these parts missing.
5,Works as advertised!,"This organizer is perfect for storing your clubs and all the other golf related stuff we accumulate. It keep your golf corner neat and tidy.OK, the assembly instructions were a little convoluted, but all you have to do is refer to the photo. It comes with the wrench you need. I had it assembled in under 30 minutes.It's well worth it for the price!"
4,Golf Stand,I Like the golf stand. The only complaint I have is the screw to bolt the u brackets should be a little longer.
2,Golf Bag holder,"I found the product to be designed OK but poorly manufactured. During assembly, several of the parts did not fit properly. I had to actually drill and tap some of my own screw holes in the metal rods (requiring metal boring drill bits) to even complete the assembly because the alignment was so far off for some of the predrilled screw holes. The directions are minimal, and the only way to correctly assemble the product is to look at the picture on the box. If you are anticipating a high quality product, I would look elsewhere."
5,Star wars Fan,"Great books. Must read if you like star wars Extended Universe. I loved them because it seemed to grow up as far as the writing went. They allowed people to die and get old, something that so far in the Extended Universe hadn't happened. The New Jedi Order series really pushed the boundaries as to what was acceptable with the force and changed many peoples view of the force forever. Very interesting read I will warn you to not start unless you are willing to read them all because they are highly addicting."
3,"glad it's there, but disappointed","I read the Canterbury Tales in college in the original Middle English, and was hoping this e-book would be in the original format, but instead it is translated. A lot of the beauty is lost in the translation. It's disappointing, but it's free, so I can't really complain."
2,Not the most useful,"While definitely an economical choice, this version is very difficult to read. As an epic poem, it would have been helpful if the writers might have been able to frame this copy in the lines of poetry, not as run on paragraphs with the individual lines set off only by in text markers. Following along and/or keeping track of your place while reading becomes tedious.High marks for price, but very low for its actual usefulness."
3,You get what you pay for,"As far as I can tell there are no missing parts to the book, but as usual with these free books the formatting is awful, there are random symbols in the middle of words and it isn't always clear where one chapter ends and another begins. Another thing that would be useful is a table of contents."
5,3rd time,This is the 3rd time I have read this book. I love this shakespeare type poetry The characters come alive.
3,Probably a good read if you understand old English,I gave up trying to read this book. I'm not sure why it is such a popular book. I'm sure someone who enjoys this type of reading would like this format.
1,Difficult to Navigate,"I bought this to read for a College British Literature course. It is worth NOTHING to me as there is NO TABLE of CONTENTS. Often times we are directed to a certain line or part, and I have great difficulty finding it. There are simply WAY too many pages to scroll through. The 19th century translation is painful to read."
2,Maybe it's just me but I found the format unreadable.,"I expected more of a story format, or a series of tales. Despite the title I wasn't expecting the poetry format."
4,Great Learning Tool!!!,I was looking for a great beginners book for vba. I've had this book one day and have learned alot of things that make my job 100% easier.
1,Not The Classic Recordings!,"I can not believe that the reviewer who gave this CD 5 stars ever actually listened to this CD. I am a huge fan of the Four Tops, but these are not the original recordings of the classic songs you know and love. These re-recordings lack the joy and spark that made the original versions hits. If you are a fan of this classic group, accept no substitutes...go get the real thing (and thank me later)!"
1,Avoid This [ONE],"Agree 100% with those pointing out that these are not the original recordings but only pale, disappointing imitations. These cuts appear to be made very recently by a much older set of Tops with extremely low budget instrumental and technical support..."
1,Buyer Beware!,These are not the original recordings you know and love. They sound as if they were re-recorded sometime much later in the career of this great group. Do not be fooled!
1,avoid this CD,Let me add one more voice to the chorus of disappointed buyers. I wish I had read the other reviews before buying this utterly useless double CD. Four Tops karaoke would be more enjoyable than these remakes.
1,HORRIBLE CD!!! DO NOT BUY!!!,I have two other Four Tops CD'S and wanted a third to add to my collection. This one is for the garbage can! The vendor was excellent- they sent it fast! I made a poor choice as this one was recently poorly recorded. It is a cheesy ripoff of the Four Tops once outstanding music! It is not of the original recordings-DO NOT WASTE YOUR $$.
4,Proposal Guide for Business Development & Sales Professionals,As a Proposal Manager I have found this book to be a wealth of knowledge and would highly recommend it to anyone in the Proposasl field.
2,Snoozer of a text,I purchased this book for a college philosophy class and what a poorly chosen text! The information is scarce and misleading with limited view-points and interpretations. My professor even abandoned it after the first 2 weeks. I found it extremely conveluded and not even worth purchasing for free-time reading.
3,dont know why,"i have no idea why i bought these it was pointless for me,they didnt really go with my red electric guitar either,so i just have no idea. there ok though."
5,The wonderful world of Dosh.,"To try and describe the eclectic wonder that is the new album by Minneapolis' Dosh, is a difficult task in that in its beauty there is a complexity undescribably beyond a human level of understanding. If you like to hear wonderful melodic marvel, than pick up this album and let it enrapture you..."
4,Cell Phone Cover,"Great Condition! Did not fit my phone exactly, but will work. Not sure the reasoning....but am happy with the product and excellent service!"
1,Doesn't fit,"The body glove doesn't actually fit an L6. In fact, unless you alter it, it presses the side buttons in and makes the phone unusable while it's on it. Furthermore, the hole for the round key is too low. Also, be aware that there is a clip on the back that is not shown in the picture and that ""impact"" doesn't necessarily mean that the case will protect against any kind of actual impact."
3,Not designed for all models advertised,"This particular case is not designed for the L6 phone, although it is advertised this way. I had to cut some parts of it with scissors, and the hole for the menu button and arrows around it does not align."
3,One of the better ones,"I have this case in black. I like it a lot. The case it self get's 4 out of 5 stars. The only reason why not 5 of 5, is because i droped this phone countless times, and the top two corners get the phone scratched up, as they are exposed. The phone still works. As for the whole set, I had mine about a year, but the clip part broke about 6 months ago. I can not find a replacement for it."
1,Not for L6,"This will not fit an L6 as advertised. The holes on the side are below the side buttons, and the strap actually pushes down on the buttons, so it's constantly taking pictures. I'm returning."
3,NOT for the L6,"When I saw the title, I said to myself, ""Nice, a case for my Motorola SLVR L6."" I was WRONG. This case works well with the L7 (I've tested), thus the three rating. However, the openings are COMPLETELY OFF when you insert the L6. It is still usable, but it looks fairly bad. I still use it when I am in need of putting it on my belt."
4,Fantastic,The only problem i have with this product is the fit around the wheel it does not line up. Everything else is perfect.
1,Did not work for me.,The vendor is superb. He gave me my money back without a quibble. The device is a great idea but very poorly implemented. It is fine for hanging low value replaceable items. Not for hanging high value lights or similar difficult to replace items.
2,Couldn't figure it out,"Maybe I'm just stupid, but I couldn't figure out how to use this product based on the instructions provided. It looks like a quality item, which is the only reason it got two stars instead of one. I bought plastic chain and removable links instead. THAT technology, at least, I'm capable of comprehending."
3,Pretty fun,"these tattoos also seemed to not last very long, but were very colorful and enjoyed by my 3 year old."
2,No thank you very much...,"Bruce has the Elvis voice dead-on and Ossie Davis is his ususal talented self. That said, all the truly funny stuff and good lines are in the trailer so just watch the trailer save yourself some time and money. This movie was too raunchy from the start and not funny-raunchy. The growth-on-my-pecker joke was not too funny the first time yet it was revisted a least a dozen times in the movie. These two talented actors (along with the talented Ella Joyce) deserve much better writing than this."
3,Great idea and acting,Great to see a something different. Bruce Campbell and Ossie Davis are tremedous and the movie has many standout moments. Unfortunatly it begins to drag heading into the third act. Still this is a must see.
4,Bruce is back!,"Bruce Campbell is back, better than ever, and bringing a HUGE slice of the unexpected in BUBBA HO TEP. Young zombie fighter Ash no more, Bruce takes on the role of an aging Elvis who battles a mummy set on devouring the souls of the residents of the King's retirement home. Yes, wacky stuff, but the film is really more of a comic meditation on growing old than a horror film. Good thing, too - director Don Coscarelli gets terrific performances from Campbell and Ozzie Davis, but falls short in terms of the more genre moments of the film. But since those elements take a backseat to terrific, strange character interplay, Bubba Ho Tep is none the worse for wear.Recommended for Campbell fans and ANYONE who wants a taste of good, offbeat cinema."
4,"Funny as crap (aka ectoplasmic residue), But...","I recently purchased ""Bubba Ho-Tep"" soley on the fact that I thought the premice was so freakishly outlandish. You can't just walk away from a plot line like elvis and JFK fighting off an evil mummy.It is a very well made movie and I salute it for being so silly. The only thing wrong with it is that there is a whole lot of cursing, and Elvis is always talking about his problems ""Down Below"" with crude language and in very vile detail.The other major gripe I have with this film is that it starts off really slowly, and you have to pay really close attention to all the dialouge or else you won't get the joke(s). One final thought: If you want to watch this movie, make sure the kids are out of the house!"
4,Bubba Ho-Tep,"This movie has an interesting concept. I will try not to give aything away. This is a Bruce Campbell movie and I have a soft spot for his brand of humor...especially in the ""horror"" genre. In this typical vehicle there is a really odd, live Elvis (think breathing Beetlejuice) that you just can't look away from even if you wanted to! There is also a black and very much alive John F. Kennedy. That's about all I have to say about that character. And then there is the mummy. Yeppers. And honest to mercy Mummy. The only thing keeping it from being too campy is he doesn't stumble around with his arms out in front of him dripping ""mummy wrappings"". It would have been great to have them all dance around like ""Thriller"" but that is not Mr.Campbell's style. And that is basically what it comes down to. If you are a fan of Mr. Campbell and his brand of humor you will like this movie. If you do not like his brand of humor...why the heck did you buy it in the first place? :)"
4,Quirky and fun!,"Enjoyed the movie very much. Quirky as expected. Even thoughtful at times, unexpectedly... Good quality movie. The subtitles in hieroglyphics (sp?) were hilarious! Only issue with the shipment was that FedEx left the first one right on my front porch, where my 6 month old puppy could reach it. He enjoyed a copy of Bubba-hotep as well! Glad I accidentally had ordered two!"
5,A REAL HOOT!!!!,"This is a one of a kind - a true cult film. The director of PHANTASM and Bruce Campbell as Elvis Presley. What more does one have to say? It is a riot. An Egyptian Mummy who comes to a rest home and begins killing it's residents -- and only Elvis and JFK (Ossie Davis) can stop it! Elvis in a walker -- he threw out his hip with a karate kick. It's common for people to tell you everything about the film to the point where you ask yourself, ""Why see it? I know everything."" So I won't. Based on a story by Texas author Joe R. Lansdale (whom I have met, a damned nice guy from Nagagoches, Texas who always runs an Akido school -- ""I call it my whoop-ass school of Akider, 'cause it rhymes with mesqueteer."") Interesting extras, including a bewildered Elvis commenting on the film! As the Beatles once said, ""A good time is guaranteed for all."""
4,SMALL films can have BIG results!,"Yes, the ending is less-than-satisfying, but Bruce Campbell and Ossie Davis are the film's saviors. Campbell does a deadly accurate impersonation of THE KING, making the viewer feel as though it might be possible that the Presley is alive somewhere in a nursing home in Texas. Legendary acting veteran Ossie Davis, known mostly for his dramatic roles, jumps headlong into his part as a resident that believes that he is JFK. Before the movie ends, you'll be thinking it, too.While the sfx and monster makeup were obviously shot on a shoestring budget, the exemplary script and dialog make up for the former shortcomings.And the slight, but oh-so-recognizable ""jabs"" at the bigger budgeted ""The Mummy"" are quite entertaining.This is ""B-movie"" that deserves an ""A"" for ingenuity and originality.."
1,I'd give it 0 if I could,"This is one of the worst movies ever made. Disregard the reviews above, this movie is nothing like Evil Dead which was a great trilogy (Army of Darkness is one of my all time favorite movies), it is neither funny nor entertaining. I was looking forward to seeing this movie greatly, renting it the day it came out, glad I didn't buy it. This movie starts bad and only becomes shoddier as it progresses, this is Bruce Campbell worst film."
1,Bubba Ho-Tep,"Are you serious? This movie sucks!!! It didn't make any sense. The plot didn't even pry into the mummy's past and barely how the mummy got there. People are so in awe of Bruce ""Ash"" Campbell, they can't even phantom how bad this movie really is. Stick with Evil Dead Series."
1,"Abysmal ""0 stars""","I have to say that this is possibly the most horrible movie i have ever watched. I warn that if you buy this you will be sorry. Thinking of what is wrong with this movie i don't know where to start. The jokes are not funny and the storyline makes no sense whatsoever (lead characters are - black JFK and Elvis). As for action there is none. The monster effects are 1. a guy in a suit (well not even a suit just cowboy clothes and a mask) 2. very poorly used plastic cockroaches on strings. This movie looks like some highschool kids video project. The ""Bubba Hotep"" monster is killed by two old geezers. It seems the only people that enjoyed this movie are Bruce Campbell fans, read the reviews and see. I will say that this movie is not even worth renting. Its that bad, a word to the wise is sufficient."
3,"HYSTERICAL Premise, Film falls short, though","We ALL know and love Bruce Campbell thru the Evil Dead Trilogy! So when I heard that Campbell was starring in a B Movie about Elvis and black JFK battling a soul sucking Mummy in a retirement home I literally RAN to the video store! With a cheesy premise like that what can go wrong?!?For some reason the film fell short. I don't know exactly where or how but the movie doesn't quite cut it. Although you can see the love and heart dedicated to this picture and Campbell was awesome, as always, it just wasn't something to write home about. I think my favorite part of the film was watching the extra features. It's so awesome to see all that went on behind the camera. The costumes, make-up and stunts.I don't mean to dump on this film, but with such an amazing premise, one was hoping for another ""Evil Dead"" type trilogy with Elvis battling more absurb creatures that go bump in the night! But this is a good start!!"
2,Great Premise...,"It's hard to argue with the set up. Bruce Campbell is Elvis who has broken his hip and is in a retirement home. His friend, former President John F Kennedy, is a black man. They are about to square off with Bubba Ho-Tep - a mummy who sucks the souls out of people to stay alive. Sounds great! Seriously, as far as these kinds of movies go, I was on board. But after watching it, I'm having a hard time recommending it because the pace of the movie is too slow. More specifically, too much time is spent developing the Elvis character. Now I love Bruce Campbell, and he absolutely shines here. But if a bit more of the movie had been devoted to mummy (...)kicking, with less time spent harping on Elvis in bed, then I think this would have been excellent. As it stands, I was a bit bored by the end and think many who see it will be too. Don't agree? Great! I'm glad you enjoyed it more than me."
2,Unmet expectations,"I'm a huge Bruce Campbell fan, and I had high hopes for Bubba Ho-Tep after reading the synopsis. What I got was a slow-moving, grossly unsatisfying experience. The movie moved poorly and tried to make commentary on growing old and feeling old. It didn't pull me in or make me really care about the characters. It also didn't really have any explanation for current events, only backstory on the main character.There were some entertaining parts, but on the whole it's definitely not worth owning."
2,Like A Train Wreck,"You just can't take your eyes off this TERRIBLE film. Are you starved for a dose of Bruce Campbell? Ok, then you'll be in your glory. Bruce takes this film to all new levels of, well, who knows what. Campbell is still fun to watch, and his rendition of The King is flawless. If it wasn't for his performance, this film would rate only one star. Campbell saves it...and it achieves a solid two star review. Horrible in every sense of the word, but, yeah baby, you still wanna watch don't you? Well, thank you, thank you very much."
3,"Wierd, scary, a guy film","Need an open mind to watch this one. Its about crazy old men in a nursing home, murder, insanity & giant bugs. Beginning might turn a lot of folks off. Scary enormous bug scenes might give nightmares. A film for 10-20 something males."
2,Nice movie for a nap ~,"I have always loved Bruce Campbell's character and this movie is no different. But the overall feel and speed of the moive leaves quite a bit to be desired. I feel asleep 45mins into the story and began to doze in and out of sleep right through the rest of the movie as well.If watching old retired elderly people talk about their once glorious life and battle a cowboy looking mummy are your thing, maybe you can stay awake a little longer and actually enjoy this film."
2,Cult film or wannabe? Only time will tell,"""Bubba Ho-tep"" has all the hallmarks of a cult film: a ""high-concept"" premise (Elvis and JFK abandoned in a cut-rate retirement home, pursued by an Egyptian mummy), campy details (the mummy wears a 10-gallan cowboy hat and big-ol' boots), and an appealing low-rent set of production values (it really looks like the director maxed out his credit cards to finish the film). As a plus, there is Ossie Davis as JFK (go figure).However, beyond the clever concept, there is not much to recommend this film. The concept will keep you chuckling but the execution is pretty bland. There are dead spaces (if you will pardon the expression)--long tedious sequences--that would have been cut out of a better movie. The plot is full of holes; the actors struggle to make sense of it.Whether or not its campy concept is enough to make it a video cult hit in future years....well we'll wait and see."
1,Too many genres spoil the movie,"This movie sounded good, so I got it. But, I didn't ""get it."" It tries to be too many things: comedy, horror, Elvis tribute, social commentary on aging and nursing homes - and ends up failing at them all. Don't waste your sentient time on earth on this one. /TundraVision"
3,Bubba Ho-Hum!!,"Not bad but not as good as I had hoped! Very original to say the least, but also tad lethargic, obviously, not big budget stuff. No, it seemed more like an adult version of the old ""Goosebumps"" kid's series. To really get your money's worth, try watching with the ""Elvis"" commentary on. That's a big bonus!!! Outside of that, the laughs are not that frequent and the last thirty minutes provides some penance for the first hour! Entertaining without being a total waste of time."
2,NOT THAT SPECIAL!,REALLY JUST WAY TO OVERHYPED BY HARDCORE READERS OF FANGORA. NOT THE BEST MOVIE MADE IN A REALLY LONG TIME LIKE EVERYONE CONTENDS. DONT BREAK YOUR NECK TO OBTAIN THIS FILM. REALLY.
3,It's certainly original.,"This is that oft-told tale of a decrepit Elvis finding a new purpose in life when he teams up with JFK to fight the soul-sucking mummy feeding off their fellow residents at an East Texas rest home.The movie is okay, but not the brilliant piece of work that the gushing reviewers would have you believe. If you're a Bruce Campbell fan looking for another Evil Dead II, this ain't it. It's got the low budget and tons of camp, but its missing that touch of greatness that seperated E.D. II from, say, Army of Darkness. Still worth a look, though--at least for those whose tastes run to the unconventional.Oh yeah-- The special features are pretty good."
2,So Sad,"I love Bruce Campbell, and Ossie Davis is a great actor. This film is the finest example of Senior Citizens battling an ancient Egyptian mummy. That being said, it's slow, filled with unneeded flashbacks, and just plain boring. I was quite disapointed. It gets two stars for some good dialog."
1,Boring,I thought it would be ok because there are good reviews but in my my opinion the movie was very stupid and this was a waste of money.
3,Not quite what I expected,"When I popped this DVD into my player, I was looking forward to 90 minutes of Sam Raimi-ish horror comedy. To my surprise, this movie ended up being a character study of an elderly Elvis (maybe) and an elderly black JFK (possibly). Characterization is usually completely lacking in the horror genre, and I welcome any attempt to flesh out the characters in this type of movie. But the characterization ended up being tedious and repetitive in parts. Indeed, this movie slows to a crawl in more than one location. And ultimately, a movie about Elvis and JFK fighting a mummy in a rest home should never get tedious. Unfortunately, this movie never quite goes over the top in the way that you'd expect based on the subject matter.Fans of Bruce Campbell will enjoy his excellent (as always) performance. And no one will be disappointed by the copious extras on this DVD. For those with surround sound, the sound mix on this disc is first-rate, as well."
3,Not what I was expecting...but still worthwhile,"From what I'd heard of this film, it was light-hearted and constantly hilarious/over the top. Alas, only a few of those adjectives describe this odd film. It wasn't awful by any means, just passive entertainment for adults willing to wait a bit for the humor to set in. Bruce Campbell is colorfully funny as always and Ossie Davis truly brings in a wonderful performance as the ""dyed black"" JFK. The mummy, mentioned in the title kind of takes a backseat to Campbell and Davis' excellent performances but it's all right in that sense. Campbell's portrayal of the ""real king"" is reason enough to take the time alone."
5,EXCELLENT!,Bruce Campbells best work ever! Great script great acting and casting. Bruce and Ossie Smith are awesome. Sure to become the next great cult film!
4,Bubba HO HO Tep,"I thought I'd seen it all but I never expected to see Elvis, JFK, and a living mummy in the same movie. Best of all it works wonderfully, and is the most original thing I've seen in years. Bruce Campbell makes a great Elvis!"
3,Bonus Materials,The Bubba Ho-Tep (Limited Edition) DVD will feature the following bonus materials:* Audio Commentaries* Joe R. Landsdale Reads from Bubba Ho-Tep* The Making of Bubba Ho-Tep* Deleted Scenes* Photo Gallery* TV Spot* Theatrical Trailer
3,So Bad It's Good,"This movie is so bad it's like a bad accident--you can't take your eyes away. The entire premise is ridiculous to the point of hilarity. Don't watch this expecting a really great movie. But the acting is mostly good, and it is entertaining. If it hasn't already, this movie will certainly become a cult classic."
3,Sometimes Clever,"Bruce Campbell (Evil Dead I and II) plays the real Elvis Presley in a Texas nursing home after he decides to change his identity to an Elvis impersonator. His buddy is a black dude who claims to be JFK who survived the Dallas assassination. After scientists uncover a mummy in Egypt and transfer it to the USA for a tour, the bus carrying it accidentally drives off a bridge into a river near the nursing home. Leave it to Elvis and JFK to kill the soul sucking mummy who is out to kill everyone to survive. Its complete camp and over the top. At first reading, I thought this might be fun, but it?s a sophomoric attempt at gallows humor with some (actually) funny foul-mouthed humor. For under age twenty-five only. Enjoy."
4,fun,I got quite a few laughs out of this one. First time Ive seen anything Bruce Campbell related. Of course since this is an independent film you get all these artsy people trying to write 3 page reviews. Theres nothing to explain! Its a straight forward funny movie period.
5,Elvis Lives!!!!!,It's not often that an orginal movie comes out. Most are remakes or copies of earlier films. Bubba Ho-Tep was a breath of fresh air and a very unique American folk story!
1,I wanted to like this movie...,"...but I just couldn't do it. Much like the occupants that reside in the rest home it focuses on, the movie starts off slow, stays slow, gets a little cranky at times, then dies. A must see if you think Bruce Campbell is a God, but otherwise, pray another Evil Dead movie is produced soon."
1,DRECK!,"The brilliant DON COSCARELLI directs this unfortunatley vile film. I just found it crass and stupid. And really, who REALLY cares? The ultimate nerd movie and I don't mean that in anyway flattering."
2,"Great premise, great actors, not much else","Bruce Campbell excels as an aging Elvis trapped in an old-folks home, with Ossie Davis doing a good turn as JFK. The idea of a mummy preying on the elderly in rural Texas works too. You can even looked past some of the cheesier special effects, but the payoff doesn't make up for the lags in the story and all the down time."
1,Over-rated piece of crap,"I can't believe the Horror Writers of America gave the screenplay award to this thing and didn't even nominate The Eye.The only people who like this movie are those who think the word ""workshed"" is cool."
3,Cheesey yet clever,"Bruce Campbell is ingenious as Elvis in Bubba Ho-Tep. His lines can be crude, yet he manages to still bring some charm to the part. The story about how Elvis didn't die and just switched lives with an impersonator is pretty clever. While it's also funny about how the late great Ossie Davis plays JFK that claims he was dyed black after his assination attempt. I would've gave it a higher rating but it gets a little too campy at the end and Campbell's performance isn't as good as it was in the beginning. He still makes a very likeable sleazy old Elvis though. While Ossie Davis is brilliant and funny in one of his last roles. I can't lie and say this is the best movie you'll ever see but I can say that it at least deserves a try."
3,"Ah, the wasted potential here....","First, if you don't recognize that from the gitgo, BHT was intentionally way, way, way over the edge, you'll be bored silly by it. IF ytou do, you'll probably laugh like hell. The thing is that based on where it is storywise, the slower pacing is often necessary, as is the back story. Campbell and Davis are excellent, and the plot is off-the-wall enough to be captivating in an inexplicable way. The big problem is that once things really get going, the whle thing's over WAY too soon. This could've been a half-hour to 45 minutes longer easily, and it would've added a whole other dimension to things. There were also a few threads that could've been followed a bit more for a small subplot or two. Definitely worth it for the performances, but try to get a used or discounted copy."
3,Above Average Camp,"Bubba Ho-Tep is a lot of fun. While no where close to the quality of The Evil Dead movies, it was good to see Bruce back in action. The movie has some wonderful moments. My favorite is when Elvis resolves to kill the mummy rather than let it get his friends. The dialogue is often hilarious. In addition, I felt the soundtrack was wonderful. The music set a brilliant atmosphere! It is worth seeing if you are a fan of the genre."
2,"a little ho,a little hum","yes it had bruce the chin campbell.yes it had an off center plot.yes it was kinda funny.but in the end it was just ho hum.story-campbell awakens in an old folks home.he either is or isnt elvis.to believe him,he is elvis in hiding.there he meets davis who may or(most likely)may not be JFK.all proceeds somewhat normally until residents turn up missing/dead.seems theres a vampire thirsty for aged blood.this is how jfk teams up with elvis,hence,the gimmick.like i typed up top...this has a little this,a little that,but not much else.a verbal review would be ''....eh...''or a physical review of shrugging my shoulders.renting this couldnt hurt,buying it for more than $10 might be foolish and giving this a good rating is fanatical."
2,Stupid!,The shipper was great.....but the movie itself is terrible! Don't waste your dollar. It is not worth it. Unless of course....you like really stupid movies.
3,Bubba Ho-Tep...,The movie was decent (I guess). I just wish that I had spent less money on it. I rated this movie 3 stars as I give the storyline credence. It was nice to see Ossie Davis in the movie (It may have been it last movie - though I'm not sure). Three stars...
4,Just a little slow,"I am a huge Bruce Campbell fan and was somewhat disappointed with this film. The film was very slow, but it was about elderly people and they are slow, so I guess it all fits. The moments of humor were too few, but still good humor. Great concept and excellent performances by Campbell and Ossie, just wish there a way to make it move a little faster!! Army of Darkness it is not.."
3,one of the bes films i have ever seen,"Bruce Campbell does it again! if you loved him as the reluctant hero in the Evil dead Trilogy this movie is for you! He Plays Elvis in an east Texas rest home, along side cinema great Ossie Davis who plays the role of a slightly batty JFK. thats right John F. Kennedy, this movie was destined for greatness from it's conception it's got comedy, action, and Drama. Bruce campbell will make you believe he is Elvis, and Ossie Davis will make you believe that he's JFK. but don't take it from me see it yourself."
4,One of a Kind,"Well, what can I say. As the director says, this is a ""redemptive Elvis mummy movie,"" and the only one, at that. The concept is preposterous, but somehow the cast and crew make it work. ""Bubba Ho-tep"" is an introspective, bittersweet horror/comedy movie. It reminded me a bit of the early Coen Brothers movies, and also ""Repo Man."" If you liked any of those movies, you'll probably like ""Bubba Ho-Tep."" It's not the greatest movie ever, but it's well worth watching if you enjoy offbeat movies. One warning: there's a lot of fairly graphic language. Be forewarned!"
4,Bubba-licious,"The wonderful potrayal of the aged Elvis by Campbell is what makes this movie cool and watchable, and for that, i give it 4 stars. I can't say much about the special effects which is averagely okay. The story itself is slow-moving but in a way interesting. If you're a big fan of Bruce Campbell, independent movies or an avid fan of x-files type conspiracy theories, then you definitely should watch this movie."
3,"Elvis, JFK & A Mummy","I'd heard some noise about this movie so I thought I'd check it out. The people that made this flick hit the nail on the head. I found it to be a very funny movie. I've always been an Elvis fan, and Bruce Cambell does an outstanding job of playing the King. Ossie Davis is equally funny as JFK. There's so many things that I liked about this movie, like the scene where the King tells off the daughter of his recently deceased room mate or when the King meets his impersonator. Even the 'battle' at the end is hilarious. All is well."
2,A great idea gone to waste.,"I really loved the idea. It's a shame that it had such a terrible script and budget. I didn't mind the acting so much. I think that Bruce did really well with such a crappy script. I think with the right writing, a few more bucks and some better direction it would have been an awesome film. I will admit that the pretend Elvis commnetary on the DVD was a nice little bonus.I hope Bruce's next film will kick some serious ass."
4,Not what you'd expect,"The movie has all the trappings of a B movie, what with an undead mummy stalking the night, and a never-dead Elvis and JFK teaming up to fight him.But that's not what this movie is about. It's a meditation on age and mortality, on doing what we can with the time we have. It just happens to be told in the form of a B movie. It's a one-of-a-kind, and movie buffs should (as Joe Bob Briggs says) Check It Out."
4,bubba-hotep,well this is a new twist on elvis presily and the mummy. i started watching this and it was weird to me but after a while it becomes good if you keep up with the story line and the actor of elvis does great job. it is a good four star.
5,The King Is Alive,"Being a huge Evil Dead freak, I had to buy this and I was not disappointed at all. Bruce Cambell still has it, the humor, foolishness, and wit that make this film for any fans want more. I hope they come out with a second one or atleast another flick as Bruce in command."
4,The Title Says It All,"This is a really fun movie that has lots of Bubba and not a little Ho-Tep. I found it very campy and some of it was surprisingly creepy. The scene where Elvis (Bruce Campbell) battles a giant scarab with a bedpan was a hoot.I loved the premise that Elvis was just tired of all the hoorah in his life and wanted out, temporarily anyway. But things don't always go as we plan in life and Campbell is very good at portraying Elvis' bemusement with where he ends up - in a ramshackle nursing home in Texas.Ossie Davis as JFK is just wonderful. His room at the nursing home looks as much like the Oval Office as possible, considering the circumstances.This is a popcorn movie well worth seeing."
4,Entertaining and Enjoyable,"First of all, the title is amusing. Second, Bruce Campbell as the aging Elvis confined to a wheelchair, held against his will in a retirement home is an image worth seeing. Then there is the Hotep, or the mummy, who happens to dress like a cross between a cowboy and a pimp, is just the next best thing to the classic the Evil Dead, where Bruce Campbell made a name for himself as the King of B movies. One of the funniest movies I've seen in a long while, even with a definitely fake gigantic roach creating chaos at the retirement home, Bubba Hotep is a great film to see if you are in a silly mood or need a good laugh. Enjoyable and fun."
5,Elvis lives through Bruce Campbell,"The concept for Bubba Ho-Tep is unusual to put it mildly. Nonetheless, the film works mostly because of the outstanding performance by Bruce Campbell as a geriatric Elvis. I have been a Bruce Campbell fan for a long time and enjoy his work immensely, however, his performance in Bubba Ho-Tep is a masterpeice. His portrayal of Elvis is subdued, warm, very touching and incredibly human. The story is fun, exciting and the other cast members, especially the late Ossie Davis, were perfect. The soundtrack is very good, as well. But, it all goes back to Bruce - a truly amazing performance. Long live the king, baby!"
4,Surprising,"I watched Bubba Ho-Tep on the urging of a coworker of mine, and even though I knew the basic premise behind the movie, it was still pleasant to watch the story unfold.While this may not be an action packed film or have a lot of slapstick or in your face comedy, the movie is full of situational humor which is definitely pleasing onceyou get into the mood and flow of the story."
4,Must view for fans of Bruce Campbell,How this movie gets such a low rating I'll never know. If you don't like Bruce Campbell then you shouldn't watch his movies..they just aren't for you. But if you find him even mildly amusing then this movie is right up your alley. Bruce Campbell delivers his best performance since Army of Darkness and possibly his best ever. His portrayal of Elvis is probably the best I've ever seen outside of professional Elvis impersonators and yet he does it a humorous way. This movie is original and funny. No big budget though...maybe that's why it gets all the crappy reviews. You guys just go watch Michael Bay spend 800 billion dollars tarnishing my childhood memories or maybe see Oceans 18 or whatever number they're on now.
2,Not Bruce's best movie,"I really like Bruce Campbell and his movies like Army of Darkness. But this movie is not in the same league. First of all the plot is slow and boring. Bruce does not have the same rouge character that he is so good at. Instead the movie is filled with frankly depressing scenes of him in bed or limping around barely able to move. This really hampers the action aspects of the movie. The dialogue aspect is not much better.If you like Bruce, my advise is to get his other movies or try to get a hold of the TV episodes of ""Jack of all trades"" episodes. It is a lot more fun and has the ""real"" Bruce."
2,Bruce Campbell fan,"I love Bruce Campbell's work; even have the whole Brisco County, Jr. set, but this movie was a big disappointment . . ."
2,if you REALLY REALLY like Bruce Campbell ...,"then buy this. Otherwise rent it. You won't want to watch it twice. Ossie Davis was very good. There are a few good lines and the music is good. Fortunately Elvis does not discuss his cancerous organ too often and we never see it.This is a weak horror movie and that is the best I can say. I am a fan of Bruce, always watched Briscoe County & Jack of All Trades on TV & I loved Army of Darkness. Never saw the other Dead movies.I bought my copy here at Amazon, it shipped Saturday & I received it Tuesday."
3,A rent once for Bruce Campbell fans.....,"Being a fan of Bruce Campbell and his movies (Army of Darkness), I was expecting a bizarre, laugh-out-loud, B movie. It has all the right elements: Elvis (not dead, but in a retirement home in Texas), a man who thinks he's JFK (he's African-American), and a mummy that wears cowboy duds. You'd think a movie that has ""Elvis"" and ""JFK"" chasing a mummy around a retirement home would be hysterical, right? While it is amusing and watching at least once, you'll probably be able to write a better script in your head.The extras on the DVD itself are so-so as well. There's two commentary tracks, one by ""Elvis"", and two deleted scenes that weren't worth watching. I can't say that I actually listened to the commentaries, because I didn't want to watch the movie twice.Even if you're a huge Bruce fan, rent this movie before you buy it."
2,Bubba Go Sleep,"This ""redemptive Elvis mummy movie"" is a cute idea not very well realized. I think the problem is the script. The action is kind of plodding (well, you are dealing with two old guys with a walker and wheelchair respectively), and the dialog is lame and vulgar. In addition, the soundtrack keeps hitting you over the head with the same musical theme, that sounds like something ripped off from Local Hero, or whatever the movie of some years back that Mark Knopfler scored. Bubba had me looking at my watch after about thirty minutes -- and I wound up returning the video to the rental store without even checking out the deleted scenes. If the scenes included in the movie are this weak, I have no interest in seeing the ones not deemed even that worthy! A great waste of the talent of Ossie Davis. The director Don Toscarelli needs to be advised that writing his own screenplay was NOT the way to save money on this admittedly low-budget production."
2,Tales From The Bubba wHO-Cares,"""The King vs The King of the dead""? That tag-line is a FAR cry from what the movie really does. Which is blather on until the last 5 minutes of the movie, and then has a quick scene of completely forced action to wrap things up (no mummy pun intended :)Here's what my 2-star rating was for, 1 star for not being the WORST movie I've ever seen, and the 2nd star for Bruce's acting. That's about the only good thing I can think of about this movie.This movie could have been a really cool episode of Tales from the Crypt about 10 years ago if it were 1/2 hour long like it should be, instead of stretching out the story to fake a whole movie. I would have rather seen Dead Alive or City of Lost Children again with my time I spent watching this let-down."
2,Very strange movie,"I am a huge Bruce Campbell fan. This was just plain strange. Bruce Campbell did a wonderful job portraying Elvis. It was just a strange storyline.I did laugh though, and perhaps with some mind-altering drugs I would have loved it!"
2,Virtually Unreadable,"This book was so strangely written that it is nearly unreadable. The author's style is just bizarre, and he really assumes that the reader is already familiar with the subject matter."
2,Horrible,"Richard Gordon is very witty. However, this book is poorly written and badly organized. There were also a lot of misspellings and other errors which should of been caught in editing. He wanders all over the place and assumes that you are familiar with the history of medicine. I am not, which is why I bought the book. Don't read this book unless you already know the history of medicine or you enjoy being frustrated."
1,WANDERING AND HARD TO FOLLOW,Mr. Gordon wanders all around topics that would be interesting if the reader were able to follow his path. He makes frequent abbreviated references to topics that are difficult to follow.This is a hard-to-read book.
2,i remember this crazy-a.. movie from back in da day,"funny,worth seeing one just to see hassellhoff playing the concert with a bunch of synthesizers. it's so bad that it's funny."
3,"Pretty good, but not the finest","This is mostly a comedy piece and delivers on that account, but doesn't have the best kind of story. The camera angles in some scenes didn't need to be diagonal either."
4,Some More 3:16 Attitude,"It is not as good as his second tape, but it is still good. You get to see why he is the toughest S.O.B. in the business."
4,BECAUSE STONE COLD SAID SO,"Stone Cold is the man,He cusses,drinks beer,and kicks ass.And this video shows that and then some.Austin is about as Americanas red,white,and blue.Watching kick Vince the owner of the WWFnever gets old.The stunner is great and it looks so cool.StoneCold also beats the sh** out of Kane,The Undertaker,and The Rockhe also drives monster trucks,Zambodis,and cement trucks all overthe arena.I bought this video for 99 cents and it was worth it.OH HELL YEAH...."
4,I think it was ok. I think it could use a little more time.,"I have this video 4 stars because it was not as good as some other WWF videos, but still a good one. I thougt it could of used a little more work, but like I said, it was a good movie. I would say 3rd best of all WWF videos behind the DX video and ""Best of Raw Vol. 1"""
4,"Austin 3:16 - Oh, Hell Yeah!","When I bought this DVD I was expecting a great buy, and that is what I got. With the extra features available in DVD it is easy to skip between the chapters and with scenes from main PPVs there is no reason not to get this latest release from the Rattlesnake! There are a lot of other scenes which you will probably have seen and remember...which sums this video up. It is very memorable and enjoyable. Only anti-Stone Colds will fail to enjoy this beauty!"
1,Another Dissapointment,"I think most people would agree that the first Stone Cold video was very entertaining. It was a video about Steve Austin, narrated by Steve Austin. However, the second video was a let down as it simply showed us a tame interview spiced with foul language to fool us into thinking we're seeing something extrodinary. Now with this third installment, ""Stone Cold Hell Yea,"" I find I am further dissapointed as all I am shown is a preview for each of the past pay per views along with highlights of their respective main events. Sure there are a few interesting scenes, and some note worthy information, but all in all that only lasts ten minutes. The other fifty minutes plays like a recap of the past few months in the WWF that no real fan needs to see. It provides little insight into Steve Austin the man."
1,neto,"the best stone cold video ever except for ""cause stone cold said so"" and ""316 uncencered"" they were better. its also the best film ever except for every other films. as good as the film jury dudy"
5,A Reader's Digest for Science,Why pour over stacks of technical journals when Brockmanhas collected summary essays from leaders in their fields?
1,piece of junk,"I read reviews for this item that told me it was durable. However, when i went to install it it broke within 20 seconds! Highly unsatisfied. I found other tie racks just like this one for around $15, but chose to buy this one becuase it was more expensive and supposed to be more durable! I ordered it as a Valentine's gift for someone, they were excited, and then it broke right away. HIGHLY UNSATISFIED!!!"
1,Cheap,The tightening clamps snapped off and now the thing is unusable. Wouldn't recommend buying this one spend a couple bucks and get a better quality product.
4,"Broken, but still good","Received the product very fast and in perfect shape. The item is as described and has completely met and exceeded my expectations. I would definitely order this again and I'm glad I read all the reviews first. In response to the Negative reviews below, I have not found them to be accurate.Although my bracket arrived broken, a little money glue was more than enough for me to fix it on the spot."
2,Low Quality Barely Functioning Device,This tie rack has several major flaws. The motor turns the ties very slowly. The screws that secure it to the bar are flat and don't mesh well with the top of a round bar.
3,tie rack,"Had a hell of a time trying to mount it. Boyfriend had to sand down rod. Other than that, for the price, the quality and price seem okay."
1,horrible...broke immediately,"how can this company even put their name behind a product so worthless? My son is at prep school and has to wear ties everyday, so he has a lot of them. I was looking forward to him having a place to store all of his ties, so I had it shopped to him right at school. It broke the minute he put it on the rod in his closet...really?"
1,MONEY WASTED,"I bought this item for my husband because we were moving into a new home around the holidays and it made for a nice gift for his new closet. By the time we got through the holidays and moved into the house, unpacked, and got around to putting this in the closet, a couple of months had passed. It worked for literally 2 seconds and then died. We are now past the return window and can't even exchange it for one that works. We just have to claim it as lost money. Piece. Of. Junk."
3,Cheap but okay,"Product was cheap, but okay. i was expecting a product of a more better quality so i was a little disaapointed"
4,Bought as a gift,"Bought as a present for my nephew. He seems to like it a lot and it has work very well so far. It does feel a bit cheap, but for the price I didn't expect much. A bit slower and noisier than expected, but does what it was designed for."
3,Fine product - Terrible delivery,The product is fine but the delivery was terrible... I bought it as a Valentine's gift and I got it at home by the end of February!!!
1,"Looks good, doesn't work good","I purchased this and really liked the ""look"" of it but it stops there. This product is very loud and moves very, very slow."
1,broke after 2 minutes,"This broke during installation while screwing it on to the closet bar one of the screws stripped and the plastic cracked before it was even tight all the way, I just left it a bit loose and used it anyways but by the time i was done putting all of my tie's on it the belt that made the tie rack spin broke. now when you turn it on it still makes all of the same noise it did before only now it doesn't rotate. this was my worst purchase of all time. DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM its a total rip off!"
2,Broke after 2 months,"I liked that the tie rack held so many ties. It made it easy to be organized. I wasn't crazy about how slow the rack revolved or how much noise it made, but I figured I could live with it because it held so much. Unfortunately after 2 months of use, the plastic fell apart while revolving. The plastic tabs on the top piece that clip into the bottom cracked from the vibration. The ties ended up in a jumbled mess on the floor and the rack cannot be repaired. For the price it should have lasted longer."
2,Can I have my tie NOW?,"I really want to like this product. Great capacity and very space efficient. Too bad it's crippled by an anemic motor. Even with fresh batteries, it creeps along at a leisurely pace. Put a few days on those Rayovacs and the progress becomes maddening."
5,Mesmerizing!,"Heard track #6 on NPR and was hypnotized and hooked; In contrast is the upbeat Adeus de Carnival with it's clear, crisp repetitive orchestral backup. Great to have playing on your CD-ROM while you're at your desk. I'm ordering extras for friends."
3,"She's great, but the instrumentation is not.","I was disappointed after hearing this full CD. The accompanying music is distracting, either too poppy or over-orchestrated. It's a shame because her voice is so incredible, I wish the music would work *with* it. I wonder if different versions of this CD have better mixing."
2,"melodico, pero sin el alma de brasil","el trabajo de virginia rodriguez seria muy bueno, si ella estuviera interpretando y representando una cultura musical diferente . Eso es lo que suena. Una linda voz, melodica, suave, pero lejos del calor y la vida que toda la musica brasilera tiene. No es un cd para los que gusten de los otros excelentes musicos brasileros, salvo por la rareza del tratamiento de sus temas. Lastima, cantando como debe haber aprendido en su pais posiblmente tendriamos algo muy bueno"
1,Really disappointing. Waste of money.,Simply bad. She doesn't have voice strong enough to take the notes she desperately tries to. You must be deaf not to hear it. I'm really sorry that I trusted you guys and bought this CD.
1,Lesson for the BBC packaging department,"I bought this from Amazon and was very excited to add this to my growing BBC library and to complete my KUA collection. The packaging says that the extras include an interview w/ the actor who plays Onslow and ""outtakes"". Unfortunately the extras included neither. The included interviews were from Patricia Routledge (Hyacinth) and Judy Cornwell (Daisy). There are no outtakes at all. Terribly disappointing as each volume before this one contains at least 5 minutes worth of the most hilarious outtakes I think I have ever seen from any television series."
2,Appearances is right,"While I may have purchased spontaneouslySeeing the actor on the cover, I thought the episodes would be specifically surrounding his characterNoHe introduces each episode and I didn't care for that"
1,Keeping Up Appearances Life Lessons from Onslow,I was extremely disappointed. The dvd information appeared to be episodes where Daisy and Onslow were the significant characters. I feel cheated that there was noepisode of any kind on the dvd. Incerps of Onslow explaining the Onslow characterwas not entertaining what so ever. I am going to ask for my money back. There should have been a better discription of this dvd. It was 100% a disappointment.Cynthia
4,A nice collection of funny moments from Keeping Up Appearances-BBC,"I love this show (Keeping Up Appearances-BBC) and still watch it Saturday nites. The characters are each funny, odd, and unique in their own way. I find Onslow to be one of the funniest of them all. Sloppy and care-free, he seems to enjoy life, uncomplicated. He actually has a certain philosophy if you listen. This is a great CD with scenes from many of the shows. I think it could have been even better had they used outakes, but that wasn't included much years ago."
2,Onslow on camera - chitchat mostly,Onslow comments on life - mostly about prior experiences with characters in KUA. So-so.
1,Died 5 days Later,"This tree arrived a week and a half late. Also, after following careful directions and keeping water in it at all times it died 5 days later. Very disappointed, when I inquired about this tree they say it doesn't die because it's on a lava rock. But, the packaging wasn't well, came in a box full of foam with no protection over it. Bad purchase, don't buy from here. I'm waiting for a refund."
5,Great Plant,This is a very nice plant. It doesn't take a lot of care. Just some water about once a week and it grows and grows.
3,Not my favorite,"But this album shows why Waylon is more than just a singer. He wrote a lot of this, it's very different than things he's done in the past...it's fresh and new. It's not my favorite version of Waylon's music by any stretch. But at least it's a stretch. Waylon has always been a pioneer, unlike people like George Strait that keep making the same album over and over and simply re-titling it."
1,AD Banker Review Manual,"I have just taken the ADBANKER Property and Casualty Exam preparation course which includes studying the various chapters in the manual, viewing a video clip covering the principles of insurance explained in each chapter, answering ""retention questions and the end of each chapter and taking a ""comprehensive exam"" at the conclusion of the course. Frankly I would rate it no better than a C-. The text is poorly organized and difficult to comprehend. The narration in the videos is amateurish, sounds like a college student reading monotone from a book without the slightest understanding of what is being read. The some videos have useful exhibits, but at the final chapter, the video appears like the producer bailed. I have found (too late) a much better manual by Dearborn Passtrak which is easy to comprehend and well organized. I'm now in the process of reading it cover to cover to make up for what I missed via AD Banker!"
5,WHY THIS HIGH PRICE?,I just can not understand why a single CD would cost so much! Can someone please explain what I am missing Please?
4,Fairly nice,"IT was not blow you away extraordinary, but it does have lots of nice traditional music."
2,Still waiting for something to happen....,"The Grace That Keeps This World was originally written as a short story and, although I did not read it in that format, I think it might be better than the novel length story. Based on a true story, I think it could have had a bigger emotional punch if boiled down to the bare essentials. There seem to be a number of irrelevant characters, which do nothing to advance the story line. Many of my fellow book-clubbers loved this book, but I just cannot feel the same way. Much of the story seems unfeasible. I did keep reading it to find our what- if anything- would happen. Unfortunately, I didn't feel it was worth the wait."
3,Disappointing,"Full disclosure here. I listened to the book and perhaps that was a big mistake. The author read the book in a very monotone style. If I didn't pay attention to the person highlighted in the narration, it would be hard to tell if it was a female character or a male character.In any event, the story itself is very unremarkable. It revolves around the life in an upstate New York town where people hunt for their meat and collect their own wood. While there are tragic events that unfold, the reader remains distant and uninvolved.The story does not bring the reader to invest in the characters and thus fails. After reading the reviews, I thought I would try the book, but I am disappointed. I am glad I was listening to it rather than reading through it."
2,Slow. Throw in a few who cares characters.,"Since the synopsis of this book sounded interesting I gave it a try. It was slow and a bit ponderous. The premise could have been a good book but the folksy townspeople that were brought in diminished the quality and continuity of the story line. Thankfully it was not very long. I listened to the audiobook version which made it very hard sometimes to distinguish between who was narrating at any given time. Look for another book is my advice. There are too many great books right here at your fingertips, no reason to not have a book you love!"
1,Are you kidding me??,"This book is horrible drivel. I am shocked that Tom Bailey is a creative writing professor. Frankly, the run-on, meandering sentences were more than I could bear. Is he a student of Sarah Palin?"
3,Not a compelling argument but interesting,"While this book was interesting and I actually read the whole thing, even as a gay person, I found the ""evidence"" to not be compelling. Gay people (as well as some heterosexuals) do this all the time ....try to judge someone else's outside (actions, mannerisms, etc) in relation to their insides (feelings, experiences, etc.) For me, it mostly shows that you can find or interpret ""evidence"" to support anything you want to believe. An argument could just as easily be made that Mary Lincoln was a dominatrix and that Lincoln loved being dominated. Sorry, but if it takes 200+ pages to try and convince us, it ain't that convincing. In that no one is going to believe this except those already inclined to do so, what is the point?At any rate, Lincoln was an extremely interesting man on many levels, and I enjoyed reading about him."
5,very interesting,"I found this book quite interesting. Read the whole thing, including the dissent at the back, come up with your own sense of things based on both the book and the dissent. It's all fascinating and a fun, absorbing read."
1,Unfounded,"Assailed for poor research, predetermined conclusions, and intellectual dishonesty. Even Tripp's original co-author has bashed this book. Don't drink Tripp's Kool-Aid!"
1,"Tripp's Agenda Disguised as ""Scholarship"" - shameful","As others have documented, it is clear that Tripp has twisted facts, ignored facts, and most shamefully for a ""historian,"" de-contextualized historic events to re-interpret them within a 21st century matrix. Anyone with more than a passing familiarity with 19th century western culture knows that behaviors we would consider indicative of homosexuality in today's society were NOT homosexual behaviors at that time. Look at Civil War-era photos of soldiers holding hands... this was a form of camaraderie, not a sign of lovers. Tripp did the gay community a HUGE disservice with this poorly-researched, gossipy and titillating book - it's clear that he was out to promote an agenda, not to promote knowledge of history or biography. Tripp ignored BASIC and PUBLIC facts about Lincoln's life, twisted and ""reinterpreted"" others, and made up a story that would sell. In a strange twist of fate, at least we will never have to read more of Tripp's tripe."
1,You might as well just buy a tabloid...,"...because that's all this erroneous piece of trash is. I'm not homophobic. I am against people trying to cash in on the name of a legendary historic figure simply to cause controversy, and thereby gain some extra dollars.Brad Pitt, Jennifer Aniston, Tom Cruise and others can sue the tabloids when they twist stories. Lincoln's dead. He can't.Just remember that."
2,The Intimate World of Abraham Lincoln,"My initial reaction was - so what if he was gay. My curiosity, however, got the best of me and I wondered what proof there might be. I ended up very disappointed with the book. The author relies on outdated sex research and twists known facts to fit his theory. The only saving grace was that the book talked about Lincoln's rather lewd sense of humor. This is a side of LIncoln I don not think a lot of books have covered."
3,worth reading...,"Not much to hang your hat on in this. The author died before completing the book. Worth reading. If Lincoln were homosexual it would explain his marrige. It also explains why Joshua Speed had so little to contribute when asked for letters from Lincoln. They were writing one another very regularly over a number of years. The book mentions the comments of a lady, well acquainted with Lincoln, who questions his sharing his bed with another man. I wish the book had been completed by the author because he made a strong case without any tangible evidence. It is also noted that biographers of Lincoln since the turn of the century have questioned his sexuality, just nobody willing to write about it. Lincoln is quoted by another in the book as saying he was no rail splitter either. He acknowledged the creating of a certain persona for political reasons. I enjoyed the book. I think it is time we all come out of our denial. Lincoln just may well have been homosexual."
3,Own ideas,"I find it intriguing that the reviews for this book seemed to be based on an article and not the book. Why is it that some people would take advice from one and automatically assume that is the correct version? Why not read Noble's article AND the book and come to your own conclusions. While some may say Tripp had his own agenda, should we just accept the word of Noble as some have done? I think I'll read both and then make more of a comment...."
3,"Maybe He Was Just ""Gay-Friendly...?""","Author Tripp makes an interesting argument, although relying far too heavily on Kinsey's theories on human sexuality to make his points.Liberally combining authenticated letters with circumstantial evidence, this well presented work is most intriguing when dissecting the President's personality: his ribald sense of humor, an innate sense of humanity and his caustic, seemingly deranged wife, Mary Todd Lincoln.An Afterword arguing against Tripp's theories is included to present a balanced approach. As the reader, you may or may not agree with the author but you will be better informed on Lincoln the man, nonetheless."
1,Boring if not another garage band singer,"This gal is unpleasant to listen to. I wouldn't pay to see this entertainer. Very boring folk like tune to her songs. Get into something more interesting like native beats or world music, but I see no talent in a gal on the stage with a guitar or someone with a voice like Susan Werner."
2,They are inexpensive for a reason!,"If you like blurry photos of cute puppies, then these are the cards for you.I think they used the rejected photos to make these cards.They may not be expensive but don't waste your money."
3,"Well, it's in stereo anyway.","Sony's SBM remastering still does not solve the overly-high recording level distortions, especially in Julie Andrews' songs. Despite the lavish packaging and ""bonus track"", the original Broadway cast album is still the preferred recording of this classic show. There you will find Julie in much better voice, and the spontaneity of the original cast, fresh from their Broadway debut."
3,My stereo lady.,"Sony's SBM remastering still does not solve the overly-high recording level distortions of the 1959 London cast recording, especially in Julie Andrews' songs.Despite the lavish packaging and ""bonus track"", the original 1956 Broadway cast album is still the preferred recording of this classic show. There you will find Julie in much better voice, and the spontaneity of the original cast, fresh from their Broadway debut."
2,Broadway is better,"The original Broadway cast album (with the white cover) is far superior to the London cast album. Unfortunately, by the time they got to London, Rex Harrison thought he had learned to carry a tune; his vocals are a poor match for his readings in the white album and Julie Andrews had lost some of her innocence. Overall, the Broadway cast album is much crisper and livelier than the London recording."
4,My Fair Lady again?,"I have heard the Columbia Masterworks recording of this show as it was produced in Isreal. Same orchestrations, different lyrics! In Hebrew of course. I wish it were still available."
5,Beautiful soothing sound of Spanish Guitars,"Listening to guitar music is not everyones cup of tea that I will grant you and I always envisaged it as the sound of someone madly plucking a wooden object with grating sounds. Until someone introduced me to the genre of spanish guitar music.This album mixes dulcit tones of soft intricate sounds with background drums. It is soothing and lifts you into this world of sun, blue water and sea air, when you close your eyes. My favourite tracks are Siesta, Cafe by the Sea and El Ritmo de Amor, it is so beautiful I am smiling even now whilst listening to it."
5,Great Music!,"This is a great U2 CD/DVD combination. The U2 singles are pretty familiar to everyone, and this would be a good item to acquire if you could only afford one U2 CD or if you weren't sure whether you liked the band. The video is great - U2's concert in Milan, but I have found that women do not like it much for some reason. I can't see why not. Oh, well....I like it!"
3,Overpriced decent product,"First, the CD: I already had all tracks on this except for the 2 new ones, and I am not the type to purchase another greatest hits just to have every product U2 puts out...but I got it for the DVD, which I will review below. I wouldn't buy the CD for the 2 new songs, either. Neither belong among U2 greatest tracks. Basically the CD was the price of admission to see the DVD.Now, the DVD: Definitely a HUGE improvement over the Chicago Vertigo performance. It's too bad they didn't release the entire concert. I wouldn't say it's one of their best DVD's, but I particularly enjoyed WOWY and OOTS, the final 2 tracks.In summary, I would never buy the CD on its own, the DVD is decent, and requiring me to buy the CD and DVD together is a shameless ploy by SOMEONE (I won't go into who's really to blame here). In hindsight, I'd say the DVD was marginally worth the sale price I paid for the package."
4,More Than The Music....,"As a die-hard U2 fan, I really liked this compilation. The live performances are amazing, and according to SPIN magazine, U2 is in the top five ""Must See Live"" Bands. I agree. I think they did a really great job, mixing up music videos, live performances and encapsulating, 25 years of gems from a truly amazing rock journey. It is true, some songs were left out...but this dvd is about more than the music. It's fun to see them as young kids, to modern day activists. As a single mother, music is one thing my 17 year old son and I still enjoy together and connect with. This dvd forms yet another bridge between the generations. These guys continually produce music with a message, and that is in part why, these Irish boys, have become legends."
2,U2WTF?,"It seems U2 simply cannot put out a worthwhile compilation. Perhaps that is why they have released so many of them over the last 5 years- they are determined to get it right eventually. They come no closer with this collection than they have with all previous attempts. From the shoddily assembled mishmash of live out-takes, predictable covers, A sides and B sides in ""Rattle and Hum"" to their previous two greatest hits collections, to the incomplete ""Complete U2"" collection from iTunes. I can only hope that I am not the intended audience for these releases, and that somebody out there understands them. To me, albums like this one only cheapen the musical legacy of this band."
2,More hash,"For the uninitiated the selections here are spotty---many mediocre tracks from the U2 canon. Better off getting the album, Achtung Baby. The DVD is a huge disappointment--I really don't understand what the director, Marvin Hamlisch, is thinking. It's filmed as if all the cameramen and the editor were drunk---mindlesss quick pans of the audience, closeups of Edge's feet, quarter profiles of Larry's face, and constant 1 second cuts back and forth. For me, like U2 Live in Dublin, this stuff is almost unwatchable.Can we say, ""hold the shot for more than two seconds""?"
5,Quick Shipping from Seller,A++ Seller. Book came in a quick and timely manner... Received well before the start of class. Thanks
4,A welcome entry into the cozies,"It's always a treat to find a new mystery author. Colley keeps the pages turning in this gentle cozy, with a charming heroine surrounded by a cast of friends and family who could turn into villains anytime. The heroine is especially well-done: a pushing sixty, energetic, too quick to say ""yes"" except to cover up a murder.The book has all the ingredients: smooth writing, absence of trite phrases, deft plot. Maid for Murder doesn't have the sharp wit of Sharyn McCrumb's McPherson series or the self-conscious humor of M.C. Beaton. But it's a faster, smoother read than most others of the genre. Definitely recommended and let's hope we don't have to wait long for the second."
1,REALLY BAD!,"tHIS WAS QUITE POSSIBLY THE WORST MYSTERY I'VE EVER READ. I KEPT READING SIMPLY BECAUSE I WAS WAITING TO SEE WHAT THE AUTHOR WOULD HAVE HER CHARACTERS DO NEXT. IT WAS THOROUGHLY WRONG COMPARED TO WHAT WOULD ACTUALLY HAPPEN IN A CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION. WHEN I CAME CLOSE TO THE END SHE DID SOMETHING SO STUPID, HOWEVER, THAT I QUIT READING ABOUT 20 PAGES FROM THE END."
3,Different than til shiloh,"I'm a rough and tough reggae lover, and I just gotta say that I didn't like this album music wise. The songs just seemed extreamly light and airy. Plus, it was as if he just discovered a casio synthesizer and thought it was the greatest thing since sliced bread. It just wasn't solid, which to me, is what a reggae album should be."
5,He gets better and better every time,"Buju shows that he can do all dancehall(love dem bad), slow(destiny)and lovers rock(love sponge)all of which were chart toppers.Even though he changed around from ""Mr. Mention"" he can still please no matter what you like."
5,Mrs. pink,This cd was very nice i enjoy it i cant stop playing it one of my friend came to my house and here it and play it over and over nice nice
5,Great,Another great Buju cd. Must be included in any reggae or dancehall collection. One of Jamaica's great sons of music!
2,It's not the prime time special,"I was disappointed to find that this tape doesn't contain the one-hour prime time special that (unless I'm mistaken) aired shortly before the tape was released. I was looking forward to owning a copy of ""Who Wants to Eat?"" and the particular edition of ""Celebrity Jeopardy"" that was on the special. If the special had never been aired, I'd feel better about the tape, except that about 3/4ths of the way through, one skit is suddenly cut off and we start getting a mix of full-length skits and excerpts. It seemed like a lazy way to compile the material, as if they ran out of room or imagination.My ideal: One tape with nothing on it but every ""Celebrity Jeopardy"" SNL has done, from before Ferrell and Hammond right through to the present."
1,"Should be ""SNL Unfunny Game Show Paradies""","This tape contains none of the funny skits included in the TV special of the same name. One reviewer wrote their review based on that special. If you liked the TV ""SNL Game Show Parodies"" special, DON'T BUY This!I expected the Jeopardy parodies with Sean Connery and Turd Ferguson (Burt Reynolds trying to be funny). Instead, I got a tape full of total junk. ""The Worst Of Gameshow Parodies"" would have been a better title."
3,Well it wasn't bad,Overall it was just an average video. The title is somewhat deceiving since not all the skits were game shows. What was disappointing was in some sections they didn't show all of the game shows they were parodying.
5,Cant beat the quality or the price.,"Only complaint is the shaft is very thin metal and my clamp crimped it a little when I tightened it. Besides that, another great product from adorama!"
4,"Strobist, do not apply.",Great product. Unfortunately i am starting to work on off camera flash and this umbrella is not portable. Love the fact though that it has multiple use as shoot through and Diffused light. Will be a great addition for a studio setup.update 26-11-2008:Have done some initial shots with these in reflective and shoot through and must say not bad at all.
3,NOT COLLAPSIBLE! Good otherwise,"I feel like an idiot because I didn't think to check that it would be collapsible before I ordered it. I needed something portable, that would fit in my backpack. The shaft of this doesn't even telescope, it's one long piece."
3,Umbrella,"Great item to add to portable studio. The wind knocked my umbrella on stand over and bent umbrella metal arms. Could be a stronger quality, but you get what you pay for."
4,breathing deeply,this book is a good introduction to deep breathing as a modality to work on emotional issues.After reading the book a class with trained facilitators would be the next step.
1,a real let down,I thought this book was an absolute waste of money. It was more of a infomercal for her workshops than anything else. I didnt get an idea of the techniques she uses at all from the book (other than a conscious breathing exersize i nthe beginning of the book) but rather heard lots of case stories of how fabulous her work was. The book hype so turned me off that I cancelled my participation in a workshop.
3,"Awful battery life, and tough GUI make this just above average","It does the job by playing a mix of 2 gigs of music, but if you expect to actually find music that you want to listen to, forget it. Just let it run. Navigating is the biggest pain ever.The battery life is 6 hours at best, and if you leave it in your bag a week or two, chances are it will be dead, or close to it. Since I despise iTunes, I wanted an alternative to the neat little shuffle. This definitely does the job.Conclusion: Since I can't expect great user functionality from a tiny little player, better battery life would make this player a 4.5 out of 5"
1,Bad News!,"I thought that the size and the capacity was impressive. But it has to work! It started one time and never again!Needless to say,it was defective.Have a good day!"
4,Good Little MP3,"I paid more for the Zen Stone Plus over the Zen Stone because I wanted a screen. However, only the song title is displayed. The player doesn't automatically shuffle songs like my last player but it is okay. The headphones aren't the greatest. After getting new headphones, the sound quality was great. Navigation is easy and not too confusing. Overall, a great player for the size and price."
3,MP3 review,it's small and holds enough songs....not good for long playing time...hard to see instructions in the sunlight....overall it's a great little MP3
2,Cheap quality.,"The player and its display look great, and it's small enough to fit on a keychain. The sound quality's very impressive for such a small player, too.Sadly, that's about all this player has going for it. The interface only lets you scroll through folders, not songs - you must play through songs one at a time to find the one you're looking for. That would be acceptable on smaller players, but not when you have up to 2GB of music to search through. The shuffle mode is awful - basically it will take eight to ten random songs from whatever you've selected and loop ONLY those eight repeatedly. Worst of all is the file transfer speed. It takes me over 45 minutes to fill the mp3 player, and that's using a USB 2.0 cable and port.Overall not the worst player in the world, but extremely disapponting for a Creative product."
2,hard,This product is very hard to understand how to operate. I have had both my daughters to try to get it to set and neither one can do it. I wish I had bought and easier on to operate.
2,poor performance,slow in responding to commands. volume went like half volume just after full coverage warranty expired. Was great before that.
4,"Great player, but hold down the button a LONG time to power on","This is a great little player, slips easily into my jeans pocket and puts up with a lot of abuse. However, people need to know that power on can take a long time -- you have to hold down the tiny button for 20 seconds sometimes. Otherwise it may appear to not hold a charge or power up and you will go through unnecessary tech support experiences. Keep holding the button until the logo appears."
4,Great product,"This is a great little player. No frills, but good sound and easy to use. I replaced to earbuds because of a size issue. The software could be a little more user friendly, but overall I highly recommend this."
3,"Great, but...","This player has some major battery issues. Charging issues seem to be mostly resolved with a firmware update from Creative, but the truth is, the battery life is miserable (about a third of the advertised life). Other than that, this player is fantastic, the interface, sound quality, and physical appearance are all excellent. As long as you can afford to charge it every 2-3 hours, it's great."
5,Great tights--takes a LOT to rip/snag them,"These are great tights, I wear them for roller derby, where they get put through the ringer. The only thing that brought down my last pair was a fall on a screw sticking out of the track that also gave me a purple bruise the size of my hand, and even then the huge hole didn't run a lot."
1,one major problem,"So the tights are soft and they feel like they'll be pretty durable- the main problem is the waist. I'm well within the size range listed but the waist is so tight it's painful and gives you that lumpy look as it squeezes you. I'm 5'5 and 113 lbs, bought the small/medium. It shouldn't be that tight and fits just fine in every other regard, but it's simply not wearable due to the waist. If your aiming for a painful day, this is a great way to go!If it had been at all wearable, I would have given it a couple stars at least but they are not wearable."
1,way too small,got xtra large but looks like little girls size giving to my 2year old neice. really dont understand or there was a mistake
3,Pink Ribbon quilt,"I did not like this book, the quilts were not what I expected. shipment was ok and no I would not recommend this book."
5,Works like a champ!,The right part at the right time (chicago winter) and it arrived in four days what else can you ask for!
4,Moenia Music Videos!!!!!,"This CD is just the ""BEST OF MOENIA"". It has the best hits from the Cd's ""Moenia"" and ""Addicion"". The Only thing missing are the singles""VOLCAN"" ( from the cd TRIBUTO A JOSE JOSE )and""LADO ANIMAL"" (from the movie soundtrack AMORES PERROS).The Best thing about ""EXITOS"" are the MUSIC VIDEOS!!!!!!Moenia Videos are rare on Tv (outside of Mexico). The video are:No Puedo Estar Sin Ti, Dejame Entrar, Estabas Ahi, Manto Estelar,No Dices Mas, and Regreso A Casa (a different version of the song). The videos are not the best in the world, but where else will you get all this videos in one Cd??? If you are A Moenia fan, this Cd has to go in your collection.Enjoy!!!!"
4,More understanding of Cathar beliefs,"I read this book hoping to learn more about Cathar beliefs. I had a smattering of knowledge and wanted more, but I was looking for real information, not comdemnation and half truths. I got what I was looking for. I got an indepth description of the facets of everday Catharism and descriptions of the more educated/trained Cathars. It was entertaining and informative reading. The second part of the book was quite eye-opening for me. It was interesting to see/read the thoughts of the returned CAthars. I found the thoughts presented there to be quite thought provoking. All in all a good read and worth the cost."
5,Product was right size and quality that I expected,I was totally satisifed with this Halloween costume for my daughter. The size was accurate and it fit properly. It came with everything indicated in the ad and on the package. It was a good quality - what I expected for a $30 Halloween costume. It was packaged properly and was shipped very quickly. I would not hesitate to purchase from this seller again.
2,Buyers Be Aware! - Restocking fee,"The size was smaller than expected, thus we returned it. During the return process on Amazon, it did not mention about the re-stocking fee of 15%. After I returned it, I got email notifying me of the restocking fee. I'm not giving ONE star, as the restocking fee is mentioned on the LONG and FINE return policy. I guess I should have read it. I'm giving them though TWO star, as I believe such information should have been posted/notified during the return process. I understand it's common to charge the re-stocking fee on electronics as you'd need to re-package it. It's a costume which does not require re-packaging!"
2,"You Were There, Rick, We Believe You.","Like a drunken machine gunner, Rick Moody does hit a few targets in The Ice Storm, but there's a lot of icky Bazooka gum to be chewed before getting to the occasional wise insight. The novel's problems are few but each one is serious. First, the eager beaver desire to convince us that he remembers 1973 grates. At one point I counted 16 references in a row to pop psychology books of the day. Evoking a certain era from the past has to be more than listing brand names and pop songs; Moody shows no sign of realizing this and though he scratches and scratches at the emotional surface of a meaningless marriage in a banal time, he can't draw blood...so he lists a few more things. Second, the novel's heart is cold; empathy takes a back seat to mockery, except where the children are concerned. Not coincidentally, the novel's strengths are found in its portrayal of the kids. Sadly, what was meant to be a tour de force slips on the ice and flops."
4,"A thoughtful, smart book","This is a thoughtful, smart book. If you like this, you might also like Goats by Mark Jude Poirier."
5,"Good book, good movie","Other than the long winded parts covering the kid's fantasy world through comic books, this is a satisfying book that left me thinking about my own family. We all have weaknesses and strengths."
3,See the Movie,I read the novel after seeing the movie and found the movie screenplay much more satisfying. I recommend the movie.
3,Someone hand me a razor blade...,"Overwritten with too many self-consciously placed references to the time using popular culture. Why do so many authors think that an encyclopedic knowledge of the cultural relics of an era constitute good writing? Seems like all you need to be able to do is regurgitate all the hours you spent in front of the television as a child while your unhappily married, hard drinking, station wagon driving parents in leisure suits and white loafers went to cocktail parties in the neighbors' split level houses. I'm depressed enough, thank you. The problem is the alternatives are messages in a bottle, bridges in madison county and people whispering in horses' ears, and they are even more depressing. Of course, there are always the memoirs, even more depressing because they aren't fiction--they're people's real misery. Help!"
3,Ice Storm: Amazing and slow,"This is with out a doubt a great novel. Rick Moody perfectly draws the hood family as a typical dysfunctional family in the 70's. Each character is relatable and stands out on their own, yet helps complete the family and story. Considering the time this book was written, it is really is remarkable how honest moody's characters are. The things this family goes through are timeless. If you enjoyed American Beauty, you'll like this book. I personally found some reading to be a little slow. I hear that if you ""survived"" the 70's this is the book for you. I was born in the 80's. Maybe that explains a little disappointment? Definately a must read."
2,Flat,I saw the movie and it was excellent. I decided to buy the book and it was not at good as the movie. I think Moody has a lot of talent yet the story did not stay with me like the movie did.
1,This is one of the worst books I have ever read,"Reading Ice Storm was a big waste of my time. The author starts the plot going in one direction, then takes every detour imaginable. Moody starts out with a bedroom scene which only has one person in it, moves on to some psyco babble, then throws in everything he can recall from a day in the burbs in the '70's. If you want to take a small trip down memory lane, visiting all the small wonders of the '70's, i.e., shag carpet, ascots, ""key parties"", etc., you might find some parts of this book enjoyable. Otherwise, use it for something other than reading pleasure!"
4,"Entertaining read, and a page-turner.","Moody gives us discriptive and thoughtful identities of two families that are not perfect, as most aren't and even gives us a few laughs in this not so happy story. It kept my attention and I liked it very much. A quick and entertaining book."
3,Book is a Huge Disappointment,"Rick Moody, stagename Rick Flair, is a great writer.He begins the book very interestingly taking each chapter to go far in depth with each character and carefully examine all of their flaws. It's a breath of fresh air and there are some genuinely jaw-dropping moments but the book doesnt deliver.The first half of the book is invigorating to say the least and it leaves you thinking that the climax has to be HUGE. Sadly, all the buildup is for nothing. the second half of the book falls on its face and leaves you with a mushy soft happy ending.Boring. Garbage. Next"
2,Great sound!.... but they fall apart,"I researched for about a month for a 5.1 speaker system to optimize my computer and Playstation 2 sound. I kept seeing Midiland popping up, so I got these speakers. Well, I must say the sound is superb on these speakers, but everything is falling apart. Out of the box I was not able to get the 5.1 setting to work. I had weeks of emails to Midiland, and they finally said to send the decoder back. I was waiting to send it back when I went back to school so I would actually have decent sound from my computer and PS2. THEN my back right speaker won't work. There's a signal going to it (ie the speaker works), and the speaker works great in stereo mode, but doesn't do a darn thing in Dolby Surround. Now I'm working at Best Buy for the summer and am most likely going to sell these speakers and get a DTS home theater system. I think these are great sounding speakers, and I might be the only one, but my speakers are going to ... after 4 months of use."
1,is this a 5.1 digital system?,i have the same problem another reviewer mentioned...no 5.1 digital out of the box! and the tech support number is no longer in service...looks like i was cheated
5,Only one criticism,"I am glad they are putting these out on DVD. My only complaint is the 2 episodes per disc. A lot of people who buy these are going to buy several (or all of them), and a DVD should be able to hold 6-8 episodes (or more?). I would pay more to get them on fewer discs."
2,Not the Best Episodes but Still Enjoyable!,"The ""Man Trap"" has an interesting premise: how far should we be willing to tolerate suffering and death so as to ensure the survival of any species. In this episode, a scientist seems to be willing to go very far, accepting and forgiving the killing of his own wife by what turns out to be the last creature of its kind that drains all the salt out of its victims. This same scientist eventually pays with his own life. The second episode on this disc, ""The Naked Time"" is clearly the weaker of the two and in a plot rather similar to ""The Enemy Within"", we see a chemical causing less favourable aspects of the crew's personality coming to the surface until the good doctor is able to find an antidote. If you are looking at collecting only the best episodes, don't get this volume as it's definitely among the weaker ones of the series."
3,THEY CHANGED THE MUSIC!!,Paramount CHANGED the opening theme music for all the DVD's. It is too bad that Paramount did this but maybe with some feedback they might go and replace the original music. Listen to the Paramount CHANGED the opening theme music for all the DVD's. It is too bad that Paramount did this but maybe with some feedback they might go and replace the original music. Listen to the difference at vidiot.com/sttosDVD/sttheme1.html
4,Star Trek the Original Series Vol 03,I loved re-discovering it again. But I gave the DVD 4 stars for the lack of spanish in the dubbed/subtitled options. A huge portion of the U.S.A. is hispanic and I being married to one would enjoy this much more if my wife who speaks english as well as spanish could also enjoy it in spanish which of course she understands better. Please add more lanurages in the future releases!
4,very good debut,"Dwight Duncan (Bushman) could very well be a rising star in the roots reggae revival. His impassioned lyrics beautifuuly showcase his deep rastafarian beliefs, the music wonderfully accentuating his lyrics.Many of the lp's tracks are popularized from his days as a dj, with ""Call the Hearse,"" ""Grow Your Natty,"" and ""Rude Boy Life"" being wildly popular dancehall tracks.Bushman has all the potental to be a lasting presence on the roots scene if this lp is any indication. A wonderful debut well worth checking out."
3,Hit and miss,"The book has some great stories about life, love, loss and hapiness. It is more then just a 'hehe munchies' collection of pot stories. However, there are many stories which are very average and i believe do not deserve to be in the book. I could have contributed many stories of my own from my experiences which would be a great read rather then some of the boring ones in the book. Still, the countless interesting and funny stories make it worthwhile."
2,*sigh*,"Lord, spare me from aging boomers, for they think that the world ended in the 1970's. I was just as disappointed as ""same old, same old"" with the book's lack of relevance for younger, more modern-day smokers (and I'm at the very lower edge of the boomer generation). I assumed that someone with at least a small awareness of marijuana's consciousness-expanding and spiritually enlightening properties (""for the soul,"" remember?) would deliver something more than the ""hee hee, we're so stoned"" genre of stories. Yes, some stories are entertaining, but not new, and nothing more recent than the early 1980s. What about those who survived the War on Drugs? Don't those veterans deserve their own credit? If you're a boomer wanting to relive the glorious sixties, a far better investment would be to purchase some actual weed. I'm sorry, Paul, but we've moved on past you."
4,Almost Brilliant,"I had already Koln, La Scala and A Melody At Night With You when I got this album, and I was expecting something as awesome as those. As far as Jarrett is concerned, he is magnificent as always, amazing at free, flawless improvisation that flows seamlessly. However, I think the side is let down by the drummer, Jack DeJonnette. He is not subtle enough, and always plays the same. Some of his solos are also a joke - just as if he really can't be bothered at all, so he just hits a couple of cymbals and waits for Keith to come back in. Other than that, a great album and well worth having if you are a Jarrett fan. (By the way, if you want to hear a good drummer, check out Dave Weckl on Chick Corea's Akoustic Album)"
3,a great musical - but a disappointment for me,"After listening many lovely musicals by Lerner and Loewe I must say that Camelot was a disappointment for me. First: the recording is tubby - I know that even in the early sixties CBS could provide better sound. But secondly: also the music of Frederic Loewe disappointed me. Of course there are ""If I ewer I would leave you"", ""What do the simple folks do"" and others but I find a great deal of music merely well-written and routine. There is not the same inspiration as before.But of course it`s interesting to listen the music of the original production. Richard Burton speech-sings much better than Rex Harrison in ""My Fair Lady"" and Julie Andrews has a wonderful voice. Also other singers are fine."
5,Happily ever aftering,"The music alone should have made this show a success. It's filled with memorable melodies and lyrics, particularly ""I Wonder What the King Is Doing Tonight?"", ""The Simple Joys of Maidenhood"", ""Camelot"", ""C'est Moi"", ""The Lusty Month of May"", and many more. Julie Andrews carries the whole recording with her beautiful singing in the role of Guenevere. The book (dialogue)is what caused this show trouble, but with a little adjustment here and there, it could well go down as one of the most beloved musicals of all time."
5,Camelot Original Broadway Cast,I can still remember my Mother playing this album when I was 10 years old and dancing with me. The music is absolutely magical and Julie Andrews and Richard Burton are superb in this original Broadway Cast. A must for broadway musical lovers.
5,"Great music, great production, great voices!","How could such a flawless cast recording be produced from such a messy show? Who knows? Who cares? When you have Julie Andrews, Robert Goulet, and Richard Burton on one recording, nothing else matters. Well, except the score, which is magnificent. Julie Andrews sounds like a goddess, not a mere princess, and Richard Burton's regal voice carries the character of Arthur as perfectly as Goulet's smarmy Lancelot puts forth his songs. Whatever the original production of Camelot may have been like onstage, no cast recording collection should be without this peerless recording."
4,cute sweet show,julie andrews voice is pure heaven as usual. all else are equally splendid. truely embodying their roles. beautiful music.
4,Wrong Richard,"The ""Richard"" Bill Holdship refers to by the McArthur Park elusion was the star of the show on stage after Richard Burton created the role and was better known as ""The Man Called Horse"" - Richard Harris."
3,Camelot Broadway,I was disappointed by this CD. I very much prefer the Movie version of Camelot with Richard Harris.The only positive side is listening to the voice of Richard Burton.
5,A must have!!,"I absolutely loved the music and the voices of Julie Andrews, Richard Burton and Robert Goulet. Everyone should have this in their music library."
4,Arrived after Christmas,This was a gift for my daughter. I had it shipped directly to her. It was supposed to arrive on December 22 but did not arrive until the 26th. The music from the Broadway production is wonderful - so much better than the movie soundtrack. My daughter was very pleased.
5,A Great Soundtrack-Will be enjoyed for many years to come!!!,"Even though I'm only 12, I have loved this recording since I was a baby. When I went to see the play at age 9, Robert Goulet was King Arthur. By then, I knew every song by memory. When I lose the CD, I tear the whole house apart looking for it! This is a soundtrack worth keeping forever! I know that I will NEVER grow tired of hearing Camelot. I always recite the last part of the song for all my friends, and tell the whole story of Camelot (including every little detail that I've researched)! An 8th grader should know better than that!"
4,The best of what's available.,"The original cast of Burton, Andrews, Goulet, and McDowall is the only way to go with this wonderful musical. From Burton's song/speech style to the beauty of Andrews' voice this CD captures much of what the music and lyrics represent; the mythical Camelot of legend. The disc gets docked a notch due to the typical problem of cast recordings of years ago, it is incomplete and skips some of the score so it is not a true representation of the musical. Despite this, at least you get a feel for what the movie could have been with the proper cast and what the play was to the many who were lucky enough to witness it on stage."
5,Learn while sitting in traffic,"This is a very good product, worth buying. You can definitely learn some language basics while sitting in your car."
3,Gut für Probe.,Good way to keep your ear tuned and practice German. Not a complete course on its one of course. It is worth the price.
4,This works for me,"It's slow going, but these CDs eat up the drive time. My accent has improved and I'm headed into disc 2. Definitely worth what I paid for them.There are a lot of choices in this area. These CDs are fine."
2,"OK, for the price","Sucks. Battery compartment is too small, seating the battery is Very difficult. Used it in our pool once. Charged the battery, reseated it, and the positive terminal snapped off, the day before we were planning to take it on vacation. Likely a better version out there somewhere."
1,Sea doo sea scooter,This product has not worked properly since I received it in June. If the maker would contact me it would be much appreciated.
3,Not for kids under 16,"We bought this item only to learn from the product directions that it's not to be used by individuals under the age of 16. That piece of information did not appear in the product promotion at all. It would have saved a product return if this had been noted. Seemed to be well made and we've ordered the lighter ""Pro"" model as a replacement."
3,Typical Seadoo work for a while then break stuff,"I purchased the first one and it arrived not working. I returned it for a second one which seemed to work fine. I am 250 pounds and it actually pulls me nicely while SCUBA diving. But typical of most Seadoo stuff, expect it to break soon. I have used the second one maybe 15 times and now the switches are all screwing up. SOmetimes it runs and then for no reason just cuts out.I have 3 jet skis, two are Seadoo's and one is a Kawasaki. The Seadoo's are constantly in the shop being repaired for one thing or another while I just continually beat the crap out of the Kawasaki and it just runs and runs. I wish Kawasaki would make and underwater scooter.Expect problems with this Seadoo product. I am now looking how to return it for repair."
1,Amazon Never Checked to See if the seadoo worked,"I am very upset with Amazon. I purchased this Seadoo GTI for an upcoming vacation. The item was listed as used but Amazon started it was in ""like new"" condition meaning that it was working properly. After receiving the item and spending money on baggage fees to bring it with us, the unit failed to work. I did everything the instructions said and troubleshooted the issue but the seadoo would not turn on. It turned out that there was no way that amazon could have tested the seadoo without finding out it was not working properly.Not only did Amazon fail to test the item before sending it to me, they then balked at reimbursing me my baggage fees for hauling the inoperable seadoo with me. I will find it hard to use Amazon ever again."
4,Spragga outshines Beenie and proves himself as a worthy DJ,This album is excellent. The beats are badd and the DJs come through lovely. A defenite must have.
3,not worth the shipping,"We recently purchased this poster and frame. My husband was sleepy when he placed the final order and it wasn't until it was too late that we realized that we were charged $45 for shipping. The poster and frame have arrived (not overnight or anything fast like that) and are perfectly acceptable. There is no glass in the frame, just a thin piece of cheap plastic. This poster and frame are worth $30 or $40 but NOT $75. We got tricked, don't let it happen to you!!!"
5,invaluable collection of gems,It's unbelievable that how they can put those dozens of invaluable gems written by graphics programmer from all over the world together into one book. It's a must for every graphics programmer.
3,Dr. Bob's new diet book is not for amateurs.,"Dr. Bob Arnot 's new book, Revolutionary Weight Control Program is a comprehensive, but often confusing and contradictory look at the lastest knowledge about why so many of us are getting heavier despite our heroic efforts to return to our youthful physiques.Those looking for a straighforward ""how to eat"" book will not find it here. As a veteran of the war on fat, I did glean some new ideas about how food effects us - many unproven ideas - to add to my understanding of my body's reaction to various food groups. I can only recommend this book as an intellectual exploration of ideas. Those seeking a pragmatic approach need to look elsewhere"
4,intellectually stimulating and well written,"This is a well thought out and well written discussion of the physiology of digestion. It reads easily and its message is clear. It's very inclusive and is a must for every dieter. It discusses the importance of avoiding hyperglycemia, exercise, good nutrition and the effects of certain foods on mood and energy. The only point that is lacking is the importance of counting calories if you are trying to lose weight. If you follow his advice and make beans a major protein source, a person can eat too many and gain weight."
3,its OK,"I havent finished reading it, there is some useful information in it and look forward to using the information to control my diet and weight"
4,Great information. Now we need a month's eating plan!,"I have read and enjoyed the book. I am currently on my second reading, but still have trouble turning it into an easy to follow meal plan. Four months of menus, one for each season, would be helpful! When will one come out? I'd enjoy spending money on it!"
4,"Good info, not-so-well presented","I've lost 30 pounds in a little over two months, and it hasn't been too hard. Unlike other diets, this one seems to have principles you can stay with for the long-term. (It helps if you like beans.) However, the information is sometimes hard to follow and sometimes contradictory. If Arnott got a new editor and cleaned it all up for an updated edition, I'd buy a copy."
4,"Good information, but poorly written/edited","This book has a wealth of good information, but the material is very difficult to follow, and is often contradictory (e.g., as mentioned in other reviews, bananas and the glycemic index, and whether bananas are best eaten or avoided). Dr. Arnot needs to stick to the health aspects, and let a good editor organize, edit, and check his work. (Knowing the egos of most doctors, however, that is unlikely to happen.) Notwithstanding the problems, the bottom line is that if you are interested in losing weight, the substance of the book is worth the (often maddening) journey through it."
3,"Sound theory, hard to do in real life. Beans, beans, beans!","All the principles espoused in this book are basically sound and seem to be well rooted in science. I had to keep reading the book over and over, though, in order to figure out what you're supposed to eat! I'm pretty well versed in nutrition, but I have a hard time planning real-life meals that conform to his guidelines. How many homemade lowfat bean burritos can one person eat? If he were to follow up this book with a menu planning book or a cookbook, the usefulness of this diet would go way up."
2,Eat acorns and beans and ride your bike daily from 8 till 12,"Another diet book that claims to be revolutionary...it even has the word in the title! The above title is my summary of Dr. Arnot's secret recipe for being hard and lean.Good: Food can be used for its ""drug"" effects, eat fiber message, stay active messageBad: Poor editing, on one table Cheerios are a GI of 22 and on another at 72. Uses himself as an example...he is not your average overweight American trying to lost weight!Overall: I think he is on to something, but unfortunately, unrealistic for most of us who are not into the squirrel lifestyle to follow."
3,Good information-if you don't follow it strictly,"I agree with many of these reviews in that the information was a bit confusing, but the overall ideas are good. Eating high-fiber and low junk-food is a no-brainer these days, though. I did like how he explained food as a drug, and encourages certain foods for certain times of the day. Much of that makes a lot of sense. I do think the diet is too low in carbs and practically forbids many fruits and vegetables because they are high-glucose. I can't even have my morning OJ on this diet! And for those of us who are lactose-intolerant, it is difficult to follow his high-dairy recomendations. This book is basically good for infomation, but I'd recommend checking out the FDA's food pyramid for better health (and it's free)!"
3,"Lightweight, and SHARP!","I recently picked up this item at my local hardware store, and found it extremely lightweight. The Fiskers pruning blade is very SHARP. Extending the pole to its max did not stress the fiberglass pole one bit. But like a fiberglass fishing pole, it did create some BOUNCing action while sawing. None the less, the job got done! Suggestion, after you are done pruning, give it a spray with Pam Cooking Spray then store. I also found the branch shears very useful for those limbs less than 1"" in diameter. One pull on the rope cut these little guys with ease. However I would want the rope attached to the shears a little shorter."
4,Replacement Trimmer Head Works,This trimmer is designed for homeowners who need a long reach trimmer for preiodic use. It's not substantial enough for professional use. The product is just the trimmer head so you have to have the original pole to attach it. The part came in the original manufacturer's plastic display and included the saw blade. It fit the pole perfectly. The pulley design for the loper blade is the original which sometimes allows the rope to get tangled. The saw part is sharp and works well on the pull stroke. The long reach of the pole is a real plus and is why I purchased this replacement head rather than buy a whole different trimmer.
3,Motion Pro Degree,The center hole in the middle was not large enough to use on a V8 engine. Not indicated in description.
3,Will try,I tried it . It seems to work all right but I will use it a little more. Seems like a good value product.
3,good but not great,"It misses the punch of the first Robocop soundtrack,that I'm proud to say I have in my collection. But still nice to have if you are a Robofan."
5,"Groovy, Man","I actually bought (at first) the 1940 one(to see what my parents were like as young folks) -- then got the 50's one since I was a late 50's brat, then the 60's for my early teens and then the 70's for my high school days, and ended up with the 80's for my college daze. The narration, content and music were all impresive in how they were done and they stuck with issues relevant to the social development in a way - that was at NO time, boring. And I'm such a Retro Hound - that this was a real treat. The extra features are great and for over 4 hours of extras PLUS the long documentary ---for the price, there is just no way you can lose out on having these if you are a retro lover or, just curious. Now - I just wish they'd do a 1910 - 1920 - 1930 series, too."
1,The Decade You Were Born-The 60's,"A lot of stock footage of the Apollo Space Missions. Oh, yeah, there was a little mention of the assassinations of President Kennedy, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr, and Senator Robert Kennedy, but they went by so quick, they didn't seem to be an important part of the disc. There were a few seconds devoted to something called ""The Beatles"" and a war that Viet Nam had with somebody. One word description of the disc: L-a-m-e."
1,Did not work,It would not play properly on a dvd player. Such a disappointment. Don't buy and waste your time or money
5,stumbling blocks or stepping stones,Very good book and gets to the meat of whats important in life -- GOD
1,LIMITED IN SCOPE,This is an amazing book because of its incredibly limited scope of the whole subject. Rather the relying on current studies and making a valid attempt to study 'homosexuality' it simply restates the same old rhetoric. The author seems to take pains to ignore science and portray his personal (and Church) teachings as the only 'facts' worth considering. You have to remember that the author comes from the same generation of 'catholic' authors who forgave the victims of their sin of rape by pedophile priests and blamed the victims for everything that happened. IF YOU WANT A CLOSED MINDED - LIMITED VIEW OF THE SUBJECT - THIS IS YOUR BOOK. IF YOU WANT AN INTELLIGENT DISCUSSION OF THIS COMPLEX SUBJECT I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS WORK.
1,Where's the warm???,"If you are expecting this product to apply warm lotion during a massage, you will be very disappointed. The only thing that warms is the massaging head. The lotion still squirts out in a cold river down your leg or whatever other body part you are massaging. The lotion dispensing is also very poor. I would not recommend this product."
4,Works Wonders,This product has been great for me! I am a runner who often comes home with some very sore legs. I bought this product and I must say that it works wonders on my sore muscles. The massager is very smooth and I mean very smooth!!! I would recommend it to any active woman.
5,Love it!,My spouse and I love this lotion warmer. It is great for massaging his sore back and my sore shoulders.I use a real light weight lotion that is unscented and add a few drops of Bath and Body Works Spearmint and Eucyliptus massage oil to it as a refill. Smells so good.
1,Waster of money,This product was more than disappointing. The messaging portion in merely fast vibrations and the heating portion is a metal plate that is barely warm. The device has two settings! Why have two settings when both settings are useless? Total waste of money.
1,An insult,"The DVD is truly one of the worst pieces of ""entertainment"" I have ever seen. Horrendous acting, dreadful songs, and a goblin(???!!!) make this a true affront to the beauty that is Hanukkah and a slap in the face to Jews everywhere. Resist the bastardization of this sacred holiday and AVOID THIS TRIPE AT ALL COSTS!!! If I could give it a negative rating I would."
5,boxcar,doing what he did best. The railroad hobo with his legendary train whistles. A unique piece of an american legend
5,does the job,stays in place and does its intended job! I use it to keep the seatbelt out of my kids neck and out of my neck in the summer time when we are not wearing coats.
3,Just ok,"A little on the hard side. Fits loosely. Ordered black and it came in beige instead. Said black on the box and on the hanger it was attached to but, it was beige."
3,Seat belt shoulder pad,This item was received promptly and was easy to install on my seatbelt. I hoped it would be padded a little heavier than it is. It is better than using just the seatbelt but better products are out there.
5,Best juicer out there.,"I use mine for wheatgrass and the quality of the juice is amazing! No lumps! It also does a good job on olive and nuts, believe it or not."
4,"Good Product, QUICK seller!","These rods work well, but they are not as bendable as others that I have purchased. I bought a package from Walmart out of all places, that are much more bendable. However, these rods are larger than what is available at my local store. The 3/4 inch rods give you *GREAT* curls if you use them properly! I am leaving a 4 star rating because they could be more flexible, but overall I recommend this product. The seller is also very quick! I received the package before the earliest date of delivery."
5,african hut,"re-did my bedroom from victorian pink roses to safari, including large mural of the watering hole. did not know what to put at window until I saw this. now it looks like the window to my african hut. thank you for the cheap price on very well made product.....not to mention quick delivery, it is as shown and described, and as luck would have it, ""it is the PERFECT size."" Now the room is done, and I almost hear the elephant's trumphant. thank you again for your help"
4,Ewen & Felicity are a terrific couple,"Could any two people be better matched? While the previous two books emphasized how different the hero and geroine were, this one concentrates on how perfect they are for each other. True, the H & H aren't always convinced of that, especially Ewen, but the reader is. They definitely bring out the best in each other; at one point, Ewen realizes that they are each better people with the other. That's what relationships should be. Ewen helps Felicity control and appreciate her magic, while Felicity herls him take more responsibility -- or perhaps appropriate responsibility -- for his life. Sweeter than the previous two, perhaps because Felicity is young still, but a lovely, lovely romance.On top of all that, we learn more about the mysterious Aidan, and there are two (not one, but two!) mysteries to solve. And of course, the families show up, creating their usual, delightful havoc. So stop reading this and go read the book!"
3,Very nice phone with limited static shield,"I gave a good review for this phone. But I realize this phone does not shield the static well compare to other phone. For the same phone line when I plug in to the phone jack near my kitchen area, only this phone had problem of bad echo and statics. When I switch to other phone it is fine. When I move this phone to other quiet location, static is gone. This phone must not have a good shield. Anyway, other than that limited static shield. Here is my old review. It's simple to use. It's has good sound quality. The plastic is solid. And color is very nice compare to the posted picture. It's has very nice touch when you dial. It is soft and feel nice. I enjoy this phone very much. You can not go wrong with ITT phone. But do not expect any feature. This phone works well with VoIP service."
2,"Looks good from the outside, but what about the inside","This telephone is reminiscent of old school style telephones. However nostalgic in appearance the quality is just not there. There is an annoying sound and sometimes so very distracting to the point that its hard to focus on the conversation. Oops, I guess its true what they say, you get what you pay for most of the time."
1,Poor interference shielding,"I run a phone bank and find desk phones to be the next best thing to headphones. I've purchased Cortelco desk phones in the past with great satisfaction. This model, however, is defective in that interference comes right through. AM stations, FM stations,static and echos. Interference filters cost nearly as much as the phones. I would suggest another model. I guess they are cheaper for a reason."
3,DVD running very loudly,"I ordered this laptop thru Amazon because $200.00 lower than at Fry's Electronics. When first using I found out there something wrong with DVD drive, it's so noisy that I was not able to listen to DVD music. I called to Amazon customer service, and it's very helpful, so I can return it. Service at Amazon is very good."
1,Watch Out for the LCD,"Watch out the LCD quality for Sonay Vaio SZ series. A great amount of people purchasing SZ 4xx in Taiwan have encountered same problem: the new technology causes multiple thick, visible vertical ""bars"" on the screen. Check here to see what I mean:http://www.mobile01.com//topicdetail.php?f=258&t;=376467&last;=3343751Click on the 5th link from the top or the 2nd link above the red text, and you'll see a picture taken by a SZ owner. If your SZ screen looks like this, it is defective.Some of these Sony customers have contacted Sony and the response they've got is ""it is not considered defective"". Well, IT SHOULD BE, especially for a notebook at this price.I purchased SZ 360 in U.S. and unfortunately this model has same problem. I contacted the U.S. Sony and they gave me same answer.It is obvious that Sony has adopted inferior parts in their production process. I was hoping Sony will listen to customers' complains and strive to increase their QA once again."
4,Serves a purpose,Thought mat would be thicker but serves the purpose. Cuts down on pounding onto floor. Treadmill on concrete slab.
4,Mat,"I purchased the mat to protect the carpet under the treadclimber and am glad I did. Gives the room a nicer look, too."
4,Excellent Mat,Bought several mats but this one was clearly the best. Has an rubber odor at first but this went away after a short time and was never that strong. Perfect for protecting my hardwood floor from our exercise equipment.
4,Saves Carpet,I bought this to sit my treadclimber on to protect my carpet. I recently moved my treadclimber (after it sat in the same spot for 2 months) and the carpet was in great condition with very minimal compression/smashed carpet. The areas that were slightly compressed came back to looking normal after a day. If you sweat a lot or are sloppy with your water bottle this also is easier to clean up on then carpet. It is very long and there is plenty of extra mat in front and behind the machine.
3,It is what it is,"The mat is what you would expect. I have a Bowflex Blaze and the mat fits the dimensions of my machine perfectly, granted it is over priced, it was easier to order online than to shop around at other retail stores looking for something that would work. The price of the mat is reflected in my rating, other than that the product is great."
5,Must have,"I am so glad amazon offered the Bowflex mat as a bonus item. I have the bowflex set up in my familyroom which is newly carpeted, and I was concerned about divets in the rug. I have to say, the mat is a big help."
3,Bowflex Equiptment Mat,"This mat came free when I bought the Bowflex Series 7 Threadmill. Not a bad mat as long as it was free. I did expect that since it came with the threadmill, it would have been big enough to cover the footprint with a little to spare. It just about made it, and I had to cheat it to the rear for that."
2,Size of mat is listed incorrectly,"This mat is 36 inches wide not 39 inches as advertised here. I had to return this because it will not fit the size of my Health Rider Treadmill. If you need a mat that iswider than 36 inches, look elsewhere as this won't work."
5,Ideal mat for a Schwinn recumbent bike...,"Purchased as a mate for my new Schwinn recumbent bike. Good lenght, verynice cushion to the mat and a nice compliment for helping to balance therecumbent bike. Highly recommend it."
3,Bowflex Mat,Probably an OK mat but it smelled very strong of rubber - too strong so I needed to return it. I could not use it for its intended purpose because of the smell. Otherwise the product was of very high quality.
2,Nice visual compliment with Boxflex equipment,"Looks good with Bowflex equipment but with the treadmill, it bunches up when using incline. I may remove it and use another treadmill pad as this particular pad may cause extra unnecessary stress to the machine when using incline during workout."
5,perfect mat for the job,"This mat works excellently with the bowflex equipment! Big enough to sit under a treadclimber (which is where I use it), and keeps carpet dust out of the motor. I would say it is a must!"
1,rip!!,I bought this same exact mat at sears for 15.00!!!!!please dont get ripped off on this one. shop around.
3,What is this for?,"I got this for free with my Bowflex Extreme 2... I wouldn't have dished out 100 dollars for it. The Extreme 2 doesn't even fit on it right, so if it's supposed to protect hard wood floors (I have carpet) you would need two of them or it would have to be twice as big.But hey, I got it for free. What do I care? It feels neat on my feet... but it stinks like a gym when you first unwrap it. Now it just smells like my feet."
4,Good Mat,"Just got my mat, which was free with the Bowflex I bought, and it is pretty nice. Nothing special.. it is what it is.. a nice looking mat. I don't see this thing ripping anytime soon. And mine doesn't make the whole room smell like rubber like someone else commented.. But like I said.. mine was free. I would never pay $90 for one of these :)"
1,expensive for its size,Love love love this soap and brand but for the size price and shipping this was a ridiculous purchase on my part. Good product (purchased. As gift) just not at thisprice
3,it's good for the money but the zen sleek is better,"it's a bulky design, if you want to carry it alot i definately dont reccomend it. Dont even bother trying to use the software to organize your music. even though creative has updated it, i still found it unnecessarily difficult. use windows media player 10. the case and earphones it comes with are in need of upgrade.the zen sleek is available now for 40 bucks more and it is WAY better with the same amount of storage"
2,Less than thrilled,"I bought the creative zen touch after getting a recommendation from a friend who's a big technology buff. I didn't want to get an ipod because I had heard several complaints about it and knew I could get more for the money. Unfortunately I've had nothing but problems with this device.I understand that you shouldn't go running with these, but on my daily 10 minute walk to the train the player would restart itself and begin at the place of that last manual shut down at least once, if not more, a day. I talked to customer service who told me to update my firmware on the player and my computer, fine. Did that, then the player could no longer be recognized by any of the file manager systems. Now the player skips, I can't change the music and just today the screen stopped working. I've had the player less than 3 months and I'm probably sending it back and buying an ipod anyway."
5,The best MP3 player I ever had.,By far the best MP3 player I have ever owned. I'm thinking of buying it again even though it's an older model. It is very easy to use and the first one I had lasted for years. Which is impressive with the abuse I put it through. The newer Creative products do not hold a candle to the older ones.
1,Not too well done....,"There's not too much substance here. I know of many Oz experts and I've never heard of any of the ""experts""--with the exception of the personalities-- interviewed on this DVD."
2,"Hmm, too girl-y not worth the $$$","Adam's a local here in Chicago. Heard about the CD in a paper, thought I check it out.The production is ok, very shiny, tons of vocal harmonies, fun noises, catchy drum stuff.. it's just that the lyrics are blah... girl this, girl that. I guess if you like girl stuff you lke this CD ok., not for me."
1,These fall apart,"My daughter got me the diamond woodstock percussion windchime for mothers day, while it sounds beautiful, it also fell apart within 6 months ! It was supposedly guaranteed by the manufacturer, I contacted them and never heard back. I would not reccomend this product."
1,disappointing,This product is a huge disappointment. It's not at all what I expected for the price. I can buy a much larger type wind chime in a local home and garden center for just a few dollars more.
1,Very Disappointed,"I purchased several of these for myself and family. I was very disappointed, to say the least. I expected a much larger, better quality wind chime...especially for the price. I would not recommend these type windchimes to anyone."
2,Leather Streches out then the ENV hits the CEMENT,Leather Streches out then the ENV hits the CEMENTOther than that the Price is a little high!
5,Amazing,"Turn down the lights, turn up the bass, and light one- this CD is bound to blow your mind. The precussion and bass will make your jaw drop, especially on tracks like War and Exudos. This CD is really what Bob Marley is all about. Listening to Bob live is really a different experience and this CD does a good job capturing his live energy. Its worth every cent."
2,too uptight for Reggae,"I am a huge Bob Marley and old school reggae fan. However, I did not like this cd because it is too fast-paced. Don't get me wrong, I like faster songs, when it is hip hop or something. But when it is Reggae, no...I have most of these songs on other cds, and love them. But this version just sounds like they are racing through their usual material instead of that slow, ""yeah mon, it's all good"" kind of vibe.I can't even believe I am not giving a 5 star review to anything he created,understand that."
4,Relaxing,A very nice CD with some of my favorite classical works. A perfect way for me to calm down and take myself to a quiet place away from robot telephone calls from political volunteers. It's also nice to listen to while driving.
3,"Hokey,silly film,but still fun to watch!","If you like bad movies with cheap effects and a poorly written script and plus,like to see what Ron Howard did after The Andy Griffith Show(as well as Beau Bridges;among others),then by all means check this out!! If you'd like to see what MST3K did to this,then find someone that may have a copy..Either way,you'll laugh!! Recommended...."
3,Future Stars In Crazy Movie!,"The 1960s produced a many youth orientated movie. Most of them were just outright wacky like this one, about some mean teens who get their hands on a formula that makes them giants. The bad kids are too clean cut to really portray juvenile delinquents, but no matter. Totally silly plot, but tolerable. Worth seeing as a time capsule of the mid-1960s, but also for two guys who went on to do better things: Ron (Ronny) Howard, as the boy wonder who makes the formula, and Beau Bridges, as one of the thuggish teenagers."
1,No thank you MGM!,"I'll never be able to understand MGM's DVD policy! Lately they've released a dozen great titles in nice looking transfers almost every month, but now and then they let a disc slip by that proves to be way below their standard. I've just tried to watch ""Village of the Giants"", but had to stop after ten minutes out of pure anger. This image is squeezed from an original aspect ratio of approximately 1.77:1 to a so called standard screen format! The result is a deformed picture where all the actors walk around with banana sized faces and Goofy-shaped legs! This is the first DVD I've seen so far mastered in this idiotic way. Slight cropping can sometimes be acceptable, but pan & scan is unforgiveable in the DVD era - and so is squeezing! This one goes back to the store tomorrow!"
1,"Truly bad movie, one of the all time worst.","There's a reason this appears on almost every compilation of the all time worst movies....An unintentional classic, on par with Santa Claus Conquers the Martians. This movie will appeal to anyone enjoying Bert Gordon or Ed Wood films, or Joy Harmon's chest.No goodies on the DVD version, which is too bad. I would have to loved to see what Ron Howard or Beau Bridges would have to say about this movie a few decades later."
5,Memories,"Classic. Strange, on some levels even peculiar. But, I love this movie. Can't do it like this anymore."
1,Crap.,"I needed this to split two computers into one set of speakers. After less than a week, one of the connections went dead out of the left side. For what I needed this splitter for, it utterly failed. Buy hey. $5. Whadaya want."
1,Information Technology Consulant,I returned these items once I received them without using them so I can't comment on the sound quality or ease of use. On opening the packaging I found an insert that stated there were high levels of lead used within the manufacturing. Wish I could have used a negative number in the rating. As these will be used in a University Computer lab I felt that it was unsafe to use. I returned them without issue and received a refund promptly.
1,Does not connect 2 headsets as described,"Ordered and received the product via Amazon. This product does NOT connect two headsets to a single device. Instead of a dual (split) cable with a male connector on one side and 2 female connectors on the other, I received a dual (split) cable with a male connector on one side and 1 male + 1 female on the other."
2,Not so happy..,"I bought this splitter to use it with my portable speakers and Ipod touch 4G. But to my surprise (and dismay), the volume control buttons on the earphones for the ipod touch do not work with this splitter. And the audio most of the times sound as if it is coming from a tunnel!A very disappointing product from Belkin."
2,Falling apart,"I bought this about a half year ago, and I haven't used it frequently in that time. Despite this, it seems to be falling apart, internally at least. It has become the case that when one headphone wire is nudged in the wrong way the sound on the other cuts out. This is incredibly frustrating, but not enough to merit only one star. The thing still works overall, afterall. I can't really comment on the sound quality. Although I'm a longtime musician and lover of good sound, I wouldn't say I'm qualified to judge any difference between the sound with this in the chain and without it. Sounds the same to me."
5,Best splitter I've used.,"Best splitter I've ever bought and used. I was kicking myself when it was temporarily misplaced, which means it's a solid buy for anyone. Keep in mind, though, that the connectors are 1/8"", not 1/4""."
3,Good until a week later.,"When I got them, I couldn't wait to use them. So I plugged them in, and put jacks worked. Used it a couple times till a week later, one of the jacks didn't work anymore. I should have known since it wasn't really a good brand and the material felt cheap."
5,Works great with Zune,"I have a second generation Zune and often would download interesting podcast I would like to share simultaneously with my wife. This Belkin splitter works perfectly without compromising sound quality. Here are some additional points:Pros-This headphone splitter is compact so is easily for travel.-The sound quality is great-Durable-Works with all standard media player headphones.-Great volume level. Individual headphone volumes do vary. If you use the SAME type/brand headphone then the volume balance will be equivalent. I have multiple brands of headphones and some were noted to be slightly louder than others, but that was expected.Con-None, it does what it was designed to do."
3,Belkin Headphone Splitter,"Pros:functions adequatelyconvenient & fits into small spacesflexibleCons:occasional issues with contacts (depends on what metal your 1/8 inch cable is coated in)audio volume - volume will be significantly decreased as a result of using this splitter >> you may have problems if you happen to be playing a particularly quiet track or if you are using a device with low outputIn general this product works. I would only recommend it for consumer use, and non audiophile consumer use at that."
2,Died after three months,"Mine died after 3 months of moderate use. It was good while it lasted, but you get what you pay for."
2,Decreases the volume,"At first, I loved this product because it allowed me to have both my headset and speakers plugged in at the same time. However, I later realized that the volume of sound coming out of my speakers was lower than I expected. I removed the splitter, than put it back again and found that it decreased the volume quite drastically. If you are using this for headphones/headsets then I highly recommend this product, but if you are using speakers that you may want to use at a higher volume, then I would not recommend this product."
4,"Also a ""joiner""","This item has two way continuity and also functions as a ""joiner"". My archaic TV has RGB and DVI inputs that share an audio input. I used this to join together audio cables from a Roku box and a PC, that now share the one audio input jack.On another note, the product picture is not the same as the product. There are 2 other customer images that show an integrated molded product. This is what I received."
5,headphone splitter,These work great in the car so that you and your passanger can listen to one mp3 player.
5,Good so far,I believe for the price this product is really worth the purchase. It makes sharing music much easier. Also I personally prefer belkins in audio accessories.
5,Useful and Amazing,"This is amazing product if you want to share your music with people who are surrounding you. It is great, sound quality is pretty much same as it would be on the original headphones. This just helps two people to use their own headphones."
2,Get what you paid for,"Hmm, I realize this is only $4, but the quality leaves a lot to be desired. Right out of the box, the sound quality degrades a lot with even the slight bit of cable movement. It works with some playing around, but probably will be returned. When it cannot even do the only thing it was designed to do, it leaves a lot to be desired."
1,wrong connection,"I purchased this splitter at the advice of Verizon in order to use my Blackberry as an MP3 Player. Verizon told me to buy the wrong thing. I decided not to return this item because I bought 2 of them , one for me , and one for my husband. It would have cost the same to return as it cost me to buy the right thing. This is not the sellers fault but I cannot say how these work because they are useless to my."
5,Gets the job done,"It's a simple product that does its job of sharing the audio from a tablet or DVD player. It doesn't give individual volume controls, but I wouldn't expect something so cheap to do that. I keep it with my travel stuff so I don't forget it. The best is using it on a flight that has pay-for TV, so we only need to pay for one seat and can both watch a show."
2,Get what you pay for,"I've had this for about two years with little use. It worked well at first but over time, one of the splitters only sends the audio to one half of your earbuds. This is cheap and just what you'd expect for a lifespan. It works okay, not great, not bad. I'd give it a D+. Barely passable. Surprising for a Belkin product."
4,Ran iPod Classic & iPhone into 1 Aux. input!,"I bought this so i can run my iPod Classic & iPhone GPS through the same Aux. input. It's works great for this! I just have my iPhone GPS app turned down a little, & they both come out of the stereo. ALL HEADPHONE SPLITTERS ARE 2-WAY!I don't really notice any loss of audio...maybe a LITTLE lower volume, but most people will not notice this.There is not much to review on this, it's a wire...it works!I do wish it was black though."
3,Not exactly what I was looking for,"I had two problems with this item.1. I can't use it with my iPod without taking the case off first - the connector is too wide to fit through the opening (I have an iFrogz case).2. The item was not a Belkin product. I threw away the packaging and I can't remember who made it now, but I didn't see anything on it that said it was made by Belkin.Other than that, it seems fine - just not exactly what I needed.For a little more money, I ended up buying the Griffin splitter (see link). It has individual volume control which is nice and it comes with an adapter that I can use with any headset without removing the case from my iPod video.Griffin SmartShare with Headphone Adapter for iPhone (Black)"
3,Better than the last one I bought... but still barely works,"I got this so I could watch a movie on my Laptop with my girlfriend while we fly on an airplane.Last time I got some cheapo one for under a buck from Hong Kong. It didn't work.This one looks and feels nicer. Although when I first plugged in both sets, hers didn't work again... but when I pulled it out slightly, it works. I guess that's better than nothing. It was pretty cheap after all."
5,Good quality splitter,"Simple splitter, good quality, have had no issues. Would recommend this model to anyone looking for one."
5,"life saver, students in bus, share it all","Yes, I drive students. Yes, they are constantly leaning out of their seat to hear an mp3 player through someone else earphones. That had to stop for safety reasons. This little, inexpensive item, saved a lot of write ups.They now, just borrow one from me, as they get on the bus, and can use their OWN earphones. No more leaning out of the seats."
3,OK,"This product was great, it conducted perfectly... except if you have a case on your 'Pod, it doesn't fit. :-("
1,Unlikely that this is a Belkin product,"I ordered this product but I think it very unlikely it is a genuine Belkin product. It comes in a small plastic bag with a single sticker on the back - not hard to forge. I'm sure it works (I haven't opened it), but from looking inside the bag it doesn't look particularly high quality - the leads are thin, and there's no Belkin branding. Plus, as another reviewer has commented, there appears to be marks/imperfections on the interconnects.I have given this product a single star because I do not think people should be selling items here that are not what they claim. However, I am not claiming that the product doesn't work."
2,not the best option,"Yes, it does what it's supposed to...allowing you to hear music from the same player in two different sets of headphones or earbuds. The quality, however, is not that good. You only hear part of the audio, and sometimes it glitches out. It's definitely not the player or the earbuds I was using. With how cheap this product is, you're better off getting a different one or just saving your money."
3,Fairly OK,I don't know if this is a normal issue in this kind of splitters but the sound lost a bit of quality/volume when trough in this.
4,The humorous tact is a blessing to a dry subject.,"This book is a must as an entry level primer on graphics, the web and cats. The furry, fuzzball, flee bitten, four legged, finicky felines are used to exemplify problems, solutions and remidies (as in real life). Seriously, if you want to learn about the net, the evolution of graphics, file formats and how to do it better this book is a good value. The links to sites is an aid to the subject matter and an interesting gateway into the mind of the author. Too bad the bookware policy of the author does not apply to some of his software included on the supplied CD-ROM"
2,Serious initial quality issues,"This product (ordered to and shipped by Mercantila) is made in China, and quality is very very poor on the one I received:1/ The computer is defective (commands do not work),2/ The wheel on the main frame is not running straight (which generates lot of noises),3/ Some pre-assembled parts were broken due to overtighneing of screws,4/ There are rust points on the mast,5/ The sensors on static handle bars are loose.Maybe I'm just unlucky...Outside QC issues, design is good, it's pretty easy to assemble. The same well built would be a 4 or 5 stars..."
1,Mast Weld Broke Schwinn won't stand behind it.,"I had a Schwinn 438 elliptical for a few years and used it very little. Probably less than 100 mi. registered on the console. Today, as my grandson was on it, the welds holding the mast broke and the mast came forward knocking him off the machine. We were very lucky that he wasn't injured. I contacted Schwinn and was told that they would not warranty this part and that I'd be required to buy a new mast. If you do a search on this model you'll see that this is not an isolated incident. The welds were insufficient and failed from metal fatigue I'll reweld the mast myself (properly) and will never, ever buy another Schwinn product."
1,The console keeps breaking,"Overall this machine is just barely okay... pretty cheap built, but I guess you get what you pay for (But I even bought it when it was a thousand bucks, $300 is a more appropriate price for this thing). Even with very light use (hard to get motivated to get on this thing) twice now the electronics have stopped working. The first time (which it broke just after a week) they mailed me a replacement free of charge but now that the warranty is gone I don't know what will happen. Not sure if it worth paying anything at all to have it fixed. Better to either join a gym or pay more and get something more solid."
5,schwinn elliptical,"This equipment is awesome. Durability is great,easy to put together. Love all the different setting. My 12 and 16 year old love the workout on this.Much better than a treadmill...."
2,Missing washers and broken pedal upon delivery,"I just received the item today. Unfortunately, during assembly I found out that 2x wave washer (#27) were missing. The plastic foot pedal was also broken. GOing to call Schwinn on Monday and hope to get a replacement ASAP. Disappointing that I cannot use the machine right away.1/27: This is a follow up to my earlier review. My item was missing 2 washers and one of the right pedal was cracked. Called customer service but the right pedal is out of stock until March. Also, any company that does not have the courtesy to ship 2 washers (missed due to their fault) overnight does not deserve to mention they have a customer service. It has been 5 days and I still have not received my 2 missing washers. If there is an example of total customer dissatisfaction this will be it."
2,Huge problem...,"This machine arrived promptly from Amazon and I found it to be fairly easy to assemble. My problem now is that it is incredibly loud and sounds like the gears are grinding with every rotation. I am trying to get through to Nautilis Customer Support to see if I can get this fixed, because I really don't want to deal with having to return this to Amazon.The machine does feel very sturdy and does not take up a lot of room, so I am excited to use it once it stops being so noisy."
5,Better than expected!,"I bought this item for my home because going to the gym was becoming a hassle with 3 kids in diapers. Anyways, I was used to using the 'gym quality' machines, however, the craftsmanship of this machine far exceeds anything I expected. You get a wonderful workout, it is very quiet, sturdy and seems to take a lot of abuse well (my husband exercises aggresively and he likes it as well, no complaints). For the money, this machine is a good investment. It is also very quick to set up (<2 hours). Delivery is super fast. I am very happy."
2,Sorry I bought it,"I bought the Schwinn Elliptical 438 a month ago. All the parts were there and it seemed sturdy. As reported by others, the lower left screw on the control panel has to be loose or it will not work. Other than that, it worked fine initially. Unfortunately the mast began to move excessively a few days ago and this evening it broke at the base where I assume it was welded. Amazon will ship a replacement but the hassle is considerable. Also,using the unit makes my knees hurt, but perhaps all ellipticals would. I am guessing a Sole elliptical might have been a better choice."
4,Helpful hint!,"I just purchased this elliptical trainer, it is very nice for the money. When we finished putting it together the display was not working. I read another review that mentioned the same problem and said that he loosened a screw that held the display in place. I tried the same thing and it worked. It sounds crazy but hopefully it might help someone else. Overall it is a nice machine but it seems very shakey when my husband is on it."
3,Assembly and parts are a problem,"Although I like many things about the finished product, the instructions are inaccurate and parts do not fit together as well as one would expect for a device at this price. I had to make numerous contacts with Nautilus (the manufacturer of Schwinn) and received well intentioned misinformation and incorrect parts as I tried to correct several lose fittings that were crucial to reasonable performance. At one point I was advised that if I used the machine in reverse, it would void warranty. The instructions specifically said it could be used in reverse. Also, there is a noticeable difference between hand grip and wireless heart rate monitor accuracy. Since the wireless was one of the main features that distinguish this from the less expensive 418, it may be better to consider the 418. I have not given up hope of getting this to work correctly, but it has taken time and effort that I had not bargained for and that is why I gave this an average rating."
3,Not too shabby,"The Schwinn 438 is a great machine for those much taller than 5'3"" and with a body frame larger than mine. The stride is too big; the space b/w the pedals is too wide; the monitor is a bit too high. Still, this machine runs smoothly and, perhaps because of these relative extremes, provides a great workout. I wish the monitor would show calories burned DURING my workout but it only shows it at the end...or maybe I haven't discovered the proper button that'll change this. Although not as great as a Precor elliptical, the Schwinn 438 is not too shabby for its price, which is 1/3 the price of the Precor I wanted."
5,High Quality Elliptical Trainer,"My wife & I were originally looking for a treadmill. But after researching about it, it's bigger in size, easier to break, and cost more to own one. So we switched to look for Elliptical Trainer.Out of all the brand we picked for (Sole, Smooth, etc), we ended up picking Schwinn. Because I can go to a retailer store and try it out and see the unit before I purchase one. We were debating between Smooth CE Elliptical Trainer and the Schwinn 438 Elliptical Trainer. We picked Schwinn for a lower price, feature-wise they are more or less identical.This machine run extremely quite, it's very easy to assemble (took me 40 mins total while listening to my new CD). It does come with a heart rate belt that you can strap across your chest. This was a surprise to me because I don't recall reading it anywhere.I've posted on FW also regarding this ET:[...]Hope after reading my review, you'll purchase one and enjoy it just as much!"
5,Very happy with the Schwinn,"Don't be worried about the assembly. Its not hard at all and I'm not much of a do it yourselfer. It took me a couple of hours with no real difficulties. It was a little squeaky at first but some WD-40 did the trick.It is great to use. I started out setting my own workout, but have recently been using the preprogrammed options. This all works great.My only complaint is that the instruction manual seems to apply to more than one unit, maybe even to a bicycle. You would think they could do better on that aspect for the cost. Overall this is a very minor issue."
4,So far . . so good . .,"I've had my Schwin for about 1 month now. Assembly was a bit of a challenge and I had a few start-up issues. Schwin tech support was average. My machine has performed very well. Noise level is low, it has a rather sturdy feel, and the control panel is great. It's my first eliptical machine and I would recommend it. It's not quite as quiet and sturdy as a commercial-grade machine but I'm rather pleased."
4,Savings Wasn't Worth The Hassle,I love the bike but getting a timely delivery and dealing with Amazon was a nightmare! The bike offers enough variety you can get a thorough workout without getting bored with the same routine.
1,VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH AMAZON,"I ordered this item on June 11 and it is now August 1st. I have just called in to ask where the item is and customer service has no idea and practically encouraged me to cancel the order and receive a refund. I am very disappointed in Amazon. I was impressed with their Free SuperSaver Shipping option but now I know WHY IT WAS FREE! I have just opted to receive my refund and buy from someone else! Signed, Angry in Texas"
3,"Good, but not as good as Spalding J5V","I coach HS football, and we were forced by the state this year to use the Wilson GST. The ball is very nice in use, great feel, good price, and works well if it isn't too wet. We also have some leather versions of this ball, and they work fine when wet.Unfortunately, the composite grip stuff isn't very long lasting. Despite the fact that we practice and play 90% of our games on grass and NEVER let the balls near cement or pavement, the new balls are wearing quickly, they look more beat up than last year's Spaldings that we used last year as game and practice balls, and still use for practice, and they are two years old. The Wilsons actually have worn the grip coating off at the seams and on the tips. The GOOD news is, it wears nice and even, it doesn't de-laminate and peel like the Nike Spiral Tech Composites did."
2,Not official size,"This ball is way to skinny. The tips are pointy and the ball is skinny throught the middle. When compared to other NCAA and NFL size footballs (the two sizes are exact), this ball is much thinner. I can see why people like it, if you have smaller hands which a lot of recreationalfootball players have, but don't go thinking this is really an official size ball. It has now become my 4 year old sons ball and I will stick with my Spalding Never Flat. It's sticky, never goes flat and is actually regulaton size."
4,Good but limited introduction...,"This is a fine, though limited, introduction to the soundscapes of Mark Isham. These compositions tend toward the New Age-y (produced, as they were, on the Windham Hill label) but show signs of Isham's jazz and pop backgrounds. Those familiar with his work in soundtracks will enjoy the beautiful (though rearranged for CD release) music for ""The Times of Harvey Milk."" It's too bad that his subsequent jazz recordings and other film music (such as ""A River Runs Through It"" and ""October Sky"") aren't included here. His trumpet-playing adds warmth there that these mostly electronic compositions sometimes lack. In short, this is a fantastic buy for the price, and a worthwhile introduction to a talented musician too often heard only in the background at the movies."
3,This used to be my favorite.,"Avalon Tea Tree Mint used to be my favorite shampoo, but the new version is watered down. It seems weaker. I hope I just got a bad batch. I would rather pay more than have a watery version of the shampoo."
1,Travel Blazer is a big disappointment,One button fell off the second time I wore it. I had to have the collar in the back re-aligned because of poor tailoring. It needed to be stitched down to compensate for the poor tailoring.
1,Phillips--The manufacturer to avoid,"This TV worked well for about 3 months before the sound would suddenly ""mute""Changing the channel would usually result in sound but in about 15-20 min the same ""muting would result. Talking to Phillips is like talking the used car salesman---promise anything but deliver nothing. For more good Phillips PR from customers. [...]"
4,"A great overview of fifteen years of ""Alternative"" music","If you can't come to L.A. to visit the world famous ""Retail Slut"", this CD is the next best thing. Doing it's best to squeeze fifteen years of Goth/Industrial/New Wave into one package, ""Burning From The Outside"" takes you from one club scene to another without pausing for a breath. A great record for those who want a crash course in Hollywood's darker side or for just catching some rare mixes from Alternative music's masters."
2,Not as good as first one in series,"I loved Flamingo Fatale, the first book in the series, but this book disappoints. The plot sidetracks with this other plot about her son ""coming out"" which really wasn't believable, interesting,or relative to the plot of this murder. I'm glad now I didn't buy the whole series. I'm too afraid her next one will sidetrack with the love life of another character. I like the focus to stay on the main character,the murder mystery, and the people related to the mystery. The murder plot is shorted because of the interludes about the son."
4,murder over easy,"""Murder Over Easy"" was great with one exception. The murderer was painfully obvious; in fact, I have never read a mystery where the ""whodunnit"" was quite so apparent. The characters & Tullahoma made me finish the book just because they are all so wonderful. There is a pretty big revelation about one of the characters, so ""Murder Over Easy"" is still a must read for this series."
1,"I was expecting over easy; It came scrambled, and burned.","This review is for the Kindle version of the book - which I can no longer find in Amazon.The constant run on sentences for the dialog is both annoying, and causes confusion at times. The author spends so much time talking about nuances of a person, or environment for which it ends up being meaningless overall. The story is predictable, and only begins to have any sense of drama in the last quarter of the book. Even then, the climax only lasted a couple pages - synonomous to a minute man. Very disappointing, and the recap at the end of the book felt a lot like those recaps of a mystery you'd see at the end of every Scooby Doo episode. A Scooby Doo episode would have been more entertaining, because it would've only taken up 30 minutes of my time. The book may have been free, but it stole several hours of my life with nothing to gained from it."
5,Ultimate Collection,This is a one of a kind cd it is so amazing to here these songs again by Barbarba Mandrell I would highly recommend this cd in my heart this cd should get 100 stars
2,not to great,"We were disappointed with this CD, but for the price I guess we can't expect much. I didn't care for the new style presentation of the songs. I like a more traditional rendering."
1,not good at all,"I was not impressed with this set at all. There are some songs with singing, some just instrumental, some are country style, some Native American style...too many different things going on on one CD."
4,New England take-a-way.,"This is a very nice DVD. The first 90 minutes are of New England scenes of falling snow, the second 90 minutes is a video fireplace, and the third part is ""90 minutes of instrumental Christmas music performed on original instruments of Colonial New England by the New England Christmastide Players."" However, the first two parts -- the snow and the fireplace -- were what I really wanted and both come with a music score. The music score is excellent, but you can always turn off the volume and toss a favorite CD in your stereo as well.What is the value of this DVD? Well, I am from New England and live overseas in Muscat, Oman. There is no snow over here and it's too hot a climate to have a fireplace. So, the DVD provides a nice festive edge, especially when we have company. Yeah...it's not the real thing, but it's the next best thing to being there.I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a holiday DVD."
5,A lovely DVD to play during the holidays,"I love to put this DVD in on the ""snow"" function and have that in the background---it is very Christmasy and peaceful. Sometimes I listen to the music that is provided; other times I play my own favorite Christmas CDs, plug in my tree and enjoy the falling snow. It's a wonderful DVD and I highly recommend it."
2,A sad look at New England!,"I was very disappointed when I viewed this DVD.I lived in New England for 42 years and saw alot more beauty than you chose to include. Yours was repetitive and , well, I was very disappointed!Sorry!"
4,Great research book,"Through the use of diaries and letters, this book tells what ordinary women in Confederate States were doing at home during the Civil War. There is great detail about what rural farm women were doing as well as plantation dwellers. Most other books I have read contain letters and diary entries from privileged women. This book has those descriptions, but also gives voice to women who were renting or leasing their land without the benefit of slaves. The book describes travel, services, shortages, daily life, fears, and emotions. Actual processes are detailed for making shoes, hats, clothes, rather than simply mentioning that the women were making them."
2,Apple Jack & Peel spray,"Was not at all the fragance I had enjoyed in previous purchase. Will not purchase again. Amazon requires more words in review so I am giving them more words, not more content to satisfy Amazon."
3,Good but dated,"This is an interesting book, a compilation of papers presented in 1993, and, as a result, feels somewhat dated in 2006. The title gives one the sense that it will tackle the very difficult questions of mind and brain from the vantage point of complex adaptive systems. But many of the papers only approach that idea tangentially. The Santa Fe Institute is a terrific place, doing fascinating work, but this book did not live up to my expectations."
3,Wizz-Not what you think it is,"Not a bad debut album, the 3 tracks are pretty upbeat. You will probably be most familiar with ""get fuzzed up"", the first track off the album. Soon some american radio station will pick up on it, it will probably blow up. I would recommend it if you are into the electronic scene, or are looking for something with that European feel. Also check out Mr Oizo, the styles arent too far off each other. This is most suitably considered techno or low beat house."
4,Christmas Gift,"This was given as a gift to my father for Christmas- he loved it! It's great and cranks out some heat~ the only downer is that it's really low to the ground. I should have looked at the dimensions. Other than that, Fabulous!"
1,Is Being Oppressive Romantic?,"I enjoyed most of the stories in this book, until I read ""An Intense Man"" and ""The Rancher's Lady"". I will not read Lori Wick again. How is being emotionally abusive and oppressive toward women 'romantic'? The women portrayed in these stories are not meek and humble ""women of God"", they are unhealthy and codependent. It's time to join the real world Ms. Wick. We can't afford to advocate this kind of behavior toward women. You may think what you are writing is romantism, but it's actually quite demeaning to women."
2,Disappointed,"Before I bought the book, I read the negative reviews and disregarded them, thinking that anything Lori Wick writes is excellent. Now after reading the short stories, I think that it is safe to say that she needs to stick with novels. Wick tried to put more information into the short stories then necessary, which resulted in a poor development of plot and characters. Even for a dedicated Wick fan, this was a huge disappointment."
3,Beyond The Picket Fence,"Soon after ordering this book, I realized that I already owned the book, SO I cancelled. Thank you for all you help. I never actually received this book the second time. I appreciate the help you give. Mary Townsley"
1,Amazon/Target ripoff,I nearly placed an order for 4 items from this collection at $91 including tax and shipping. Didn't like the pronise date and expedited shipping was an extra $25! So I shopped further. Got the same 4 pieces from Kmart with faster shipping for a grand total of $61! Target should be ashamed and Amazon should use a little more discretion in choosing partners.The low rating is obviously for the vendors not the product.
1,Katleen Guler did not do her historical research,"Into the Path of Gods by Kathleen Cunningham Guler starts outon the premise that it is an historical novel set in mid-Fifth CenturyDark Ages Britain. However, the author subjects her readers to a number of historical inaccuracies that negate her credibility as an author of historical romance, adventure, or fiction. She uses modern idioms which destroy the mood she is trying to create. While these are minor errors and can be forgiven, provided the novel is otherwise well written, there are some grave mistakes which lead me to believe that Ms. Guler and her editors did not do any background research, or at best, very little. The factual errors spoiled the entire book for me, and I do not give this book any stars. I recommend that you do not buy it, that is, unless you want to see how many mistakes you can find!"
5,A feminist man who's both smart and honest,"Here are a few of the many reasons I keep reading everything Mike Messner writes:1) He seems to take the feminist ""personal is political"" slogan to heart, revealing much more of himself and his own questions and vulnerabilities than most other male writers.2) He uses both academic and journalistic techniques to research his topics and support his theses.3) He lacks the arrogance of many experts, retaining an open mind as he delibertely attempts to look at things in original ways.4) The topic of this book -- and several of his others -- continues to fascinate me. By looking at how we ""do gender"" in a sporting context, we come to understand so much about how and why any and all women and men behave as we do.Highly recommended. -- Mariah Burton Nelson"
5,CABARET!! OH BABY THEY DESERVE A CABARET!!!!!,"So, your thinkin' of buyin' it huh??? Well don't think and just do it come on , come on, don't be stupid let your pocket flow and meet your dough!!! That's All I Ask Of You!!!!!"
5,Work as intended,"These knobs arrived in perfect condition, the correct color and fit my Stratocaster remake well. You can't necessarily go wrong with knobs. I like the black look to my guitar now."
4,Strat Knobs,"These knobs were a nice, sleek replacement for when I put my black pickguard on. ihad a bit of trouble with the size of them, but I found out that was human error on my part. Also, this product does not come with an instruction booklet or manual, so inexperienced people may have slight issues doing this."
4,The Hunt Echoes From The dark,"Antonio Marquez writes his tale in a conversational prose that makes you feel a comfortable friend is telling a damn good yarn. This is not a book for the faint of heart. From the first page to the last Mr. Marquez carries the reader through lives that are elevated by love, frustrated by fear and destroyed by hate."
4,"This CD is a lean, mean funk machine.","Simply Jeff is livin' the funky life with a strong, eclectic blend of beats on ""Funk Da Fried Vol. 2."" He gets things rolling pretty quickly after a simple introduction track of his own making and I would advise hanging on to the nearest barstool during the next eight tracks. S.J. unleashes a brilliant mix of funk during the first half of this CD. He does a fantastic job of blending tribal beats with kickin' futuristic sounds. The downfall of this mix, however, is that the momentum is somewhat lost during the latter half of the CD. Don't get me wrong though. There are still some fairly amazing tunes flowing through it, but overall the mix drops in velocity. All in all, this doesn't mean much because the first stretch of funk makes it worth the purchase. If you dig DJ John Kelley, Uberzone, or the like, don't hesitate to give this a good listening to. It will surely bring a sexy little smile to your face."
4,Handy Light,Simple to use and puts out a good amount of light. It turns on when you open it and off when closed. So you might need a little extra room to be able to close it without hitting you precious plant.Be sure not to put the light too close to the plants. And be sure to tighten the hinge so it does not swing down on top of something. And I recommend getting a timer so that you can set it up and forget it.
3,Replacement Bulbs are expensive,"I love my OTT-light. It was the only thing that finally got my african violets to bloom inside. The light itself was expensive ($60) and the bulbs cost almost $30. It works well, but the replacement bulbs can also be hard to find."
5,"Spike Jones-the original ""weird AL"" at his best!","At last the marriage of two of my favorite things: Halloween and novelty music and by the master himself (and a few choice guests!).. . Fans of Disney's Haunted Mansion (and Bullwinkle's Boris) will recognize the voice of Paul Frees. Here is a collection of delightful, wacky and a bit dark fun from the king of parody (the extended re cut of My Old Flame is fantastic!!). . .A must for fans of SJ and/or Halloween!"
3,A Matter of Opinion,"Spike's long play albums do not have the timing and tight editing his 78's do. This is to be expected. Filling up a long play album takes a heck of lot of jokes. Spike seemed to be more concerned with filling time than with the careful editing and pacing of material. I foound this album to be slow paced. In fact, it painfully drags in spots. The songs are naturally tighter but lack the spark of his old wit. I felt the whole ""monster and gore"" theme of the album to be overplayed. Get this album only after you are completely familiar with Spike's older works...or if you enjoyed this album in your youth or while visiting a friend's place."
3,Many errors!,"The first two recipes I tried had serious errors. I have found that some ingredient or mixture is specified, then never used. Had to do some quick thinking and googling to figure out what was likely intended. The dishes ended up good, but I wonder what the rest of the recipes are like..."
1,Um... Is New Wave Retro Now?,"Who gave these clowns their Casio keyboard and Radio Shack mics? Actually, I saw their equipment list and it would make the Chemical Brothers jealous. But somehow, these spoiled brats from Orange County managed to fill a WHOLE CD with total You see what fundamentalist christian dogma can do to your children?! Christ folks, do us a favor and stick to the songs in your hymn books! Someone should hire these guys on to make music for the Barney show. Thumbs down. Way down... People in hell are staring at my thumb right now."
4,Very nice but SMALL!,"They downsized it while my order was delayed but price stayed high. Its very nice, but easily overlooked."
4,A very solid album,"This is a very good, solid album. I would recommend it for those who have followed Divine Styler. His beats have always been somewhat different from everyone else and this album is no different. The lyrics are on point as usual. However, sometimes he gets just a little too abstract, some tracks leave me going 'what was that?'. No doubt though, if you like Divine Styler, even just a little bit, you'll love this album; just don't be expecting any super-classic material here."
2,Degradation of Hip Hop,"Now dont get me wrong, Im all for the natural progression of hip hop, but Divine Styler and his latest album ""Wordpower 2"" completey strays from the path that his forefathers have paved for him. Comparing DS to any of the once underground hip hop artits such as the roots, talib kweli, asheru and blue black, and even younger artist like kanye west, you can begin to understand that the likes of DS, aceyalone and company have completely forgotten about rythym, flow, and beats. I.E. thats why he doesnt sell any records. Im not hating but all my life hip hop has been so inspiring because of every single aspect of the beat and the way that the vocals just play off it. DS has taken that away from hip hop and therefore taken away the inspiration. I give him 2 stars simply on the basis that he's not Bird man, Juvenile, or the latest Outkast cds."
4,Everyday Psychokillers,"For required reading, this book was actually extremely entertaining, and not at all what I was expecting. The title ""Everyday Psychokillers"" is a perfect title, but it also made me think the book was going to be much more creepy than it actually was. The basic idea is this: everyone has the potential of being a psychokiller.That sounds pretty presumptuous, but after reading the book I have been oddly enlightened. Corin did an excellent job combining myths and little anecdotal stories to create a book that explores the idea of the everyday person as a psychokiller. The stories included were all interesting and thought provoking, and the imagery was incredible.I'm not sure who I would recommend this book to, but I know that if there are definitely some interesting ideas and concepts brought up in the book. If you're feeling inclined enough to read it, I'd say go for it"
1,Nothing new here!,"Having the pleasure both of knowing and having practised with one of the authors of this book, I expected a lot more. What I found was mediocre, lacking any particular life or relevance. To make matters worse, it's all been done before and done better too. The illustrations are poor quality black and white and seem to be the same set that are recycled through every sub standard coffee table book on Zen.The authors had a real chance here to write something relevant and interesting, instead this book gives the impression of being written to a formula, in a hurry and for the specific purpose of making a fast buck, rather than drawing us deeper into the world of Zen Buddhist practice. If this book was a creative writing effort one would have to say, ""Could do a lot better"". I'd suggest that the reader try a book like 'Zen Meditation in Plain English' By Peter Matthiessen and John Daishin Buksbazen instead. It does what it says on the tin and does it with elegance and simplicity."
2,Pretty crappy,"I purchased these clippers so I would have a light duty clipping system for my horse's face. I'm very unimpressed. The blades don't cut consistently and they caught constantly, especially when clipping the bridle path. I would not recommend."
1,A Piece of Junk...Plain and Simple,"Without re-writing all of the previous reviews, it suffices to say that I concur with all of the criticisms about this piece of junk. Primarily I believe that it looks and feels cheaply made, and the battery life is less than one hour when fully charged. This item is essentially unusable, and a total waste of money. Considering the very cheap price of this item, you certainly get everything you pay for."
1,Jabra Bluetooth Speakerphone,"It is too big and too bulky to use in the car. Its clip will not hold to the visor because it simply weighs too much. And, the microphone is too weak to pick up cell phone voice commands. This was a waste of money."
1,Poor volume and duplexing,Don't buy this phone. It has poor sound volume and often goes quiet when it hears car noise or thinks you are speaking. Must not be a full duplex speaker phone. Also isn't at all reliable switching between office or car modes.
2,Horriable,"Sound quality is not there, does not work good in moving vehicle due to background noise. I would not recommend this product"
1,This is an expensive piece of crap!,"This speakerphone is crap!!! Too bad I can't give it 0 stars. The voice quality is so bad, that the person that you're talking to can't understand anything... so buy it and trow it away like 2 days later when you realize it's no good!"
1,Save your money!,"I bought 3 of these on clearance as gifts thinking it was a great deal. I was too embarrased to give them. I kept one for myself - and have learned to suffer through it. The included batteries wouldn't take a charge, the speaker consistently quits (speaky, but no heary). can't get the light to quit flashing as instructed. I hope the newer version actually works!"
1,Worthless speakerphone,"This product is worthless, you can hear the incoming call fine but they cannot listen to you. It's pretty frustrating trying to have a conversation using this. Save your money and buy something else that works."
1,Bad... Very Bad ... I feel deceived.,"The microphone is very bad, they never listen to me, when I speak.I feel deceived."
5,Great Way To Practice With A Virtual Band,Length:: 2:20 MinsThe video speaks volumes about what a useful tool this is for guitarists and musicians.
3,Should be on AFI's Top 100 Comedies List,"This was one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. The first time I saw it was with my wife 20 years ago, and I thought we would both pass out from laughing so hard. There is nothing more to say about this wonderfully assinine movie. It is an absolute treat."
3,BODY AND SOUL,The MGM Midnite Movies serie allows us to discover or rediscover a certain category of films one usually doesn't find in stores nor watch on television during decent hours. THE THING WITH TWO HEADS belongs to the sub-sub-sub genre of the exploitation/horror/sci-fi/car crash movies of the beginning of the seventies. And I've watched it until the end.The picture is funny at times but an overlong track race destroys the indulgence created in the viewer's mind by the original idea presented. What remains is the pleasure to admire Ray Milland and a few scenes deserving to stay in the annals of the most improbable plots ever invented.Only a trailer and subtitles as bonus features.A DVD zone nostalgia.
2,You know going in....,"that this isn't gonna be a cinema classic. But it isn't even bad enough to qualify for a fun-for-the-wrong-reasons flick. Yeah, it has a few moments, but then completely falls apart and actually begins to get boring, cumminated by the never-ending cycle chase. It's absolutely painful to watch Milland waste his talent here."
4,Not a bad movie not a great one either,Kind of a cool movie I thought most of it was funny total camp movie from the 70's not what I remembered but a good overall movie. Sound and video transfer was done good.
5,The best bad movie of all time?,"I've seen lots of old B movies,for unitended comedy this movie is the king.You really get the feeling That Max (Ray Milland) genuinely hates Jack (Rosey Grier)Ray Milland plays a bigoted transplant surgeon who could give Archie Bunker a run for his money.Max Kirshner learns he's dying and figures he'll just attach his brilliant head to another mans body,unfortunately,his only suitable donor is a black convict,needless to say they're less then thrilled with this situation, look for the long-haired stuntman during the classic motorcycle chase scene,who looks nothing like Milland or Grier.Great movie not as bad as you might think."
1,Rick Baker's work is a joke,"The man has no talent. To make a movie where he works on creating afake head so two actors can make fools of themselves, is a sign of no talent and utter cheapness. Anyone who likes Baker's work is sick."
5,Close to perfect,"OK, it is a bit short of perfect. It can be loud. I once had to replace an arm. I replaced the seat with a more comfortable one (Serfas Exercise Bike Seat). But then, I've had it 30+ years. And my second (mechanical) odometer just reset to zero--after 10,000 miles. Try THAT on your average sports store exercise bike."
5,Absolutely love my Airdyne!!!,"I've had my Airdyne for many years, and I'm just getting ready to roll over 20,000 miles on it. It's a versatile tool. I use it for regular bicycle training, cardio, and interval use. It's a lot of money, but it's well built. I've had mine in the shop twice--once for a 10,000 mile tune-up, and another time when the crank broke, and that's it. It's time tested--not some glitzy fad that will end up in a garage sale."
4,THIS BIKE WILL BLOW YOU AWAY,I HAVE ALWAYS ENJOYED THE AIR RESISTANCE TYPE OF EXERCIZER UNFORTUNATLY THERE ARE NOT TO MANY AROUND ANY MORE . THIS BIKE GIVES YOU A GREAT WORK OUT . THE FASTER YOU GO THE HARDER IT GETS .THE ONLY DOWN SIDE I SEE SO FAR IS THERE IS NO WAY TO CONTROL THE AIR HITTING YOU AS YOU PEDAL . WHEN I START MY WORK OUT I LIKE TO GET HEATED UP. BUT THE COOL BREEZE EXTENDES THAT WARM UP TIME . I ENDED UP PUTTING A PIECE OF LEATHER ON THE FAN SHROUD TO BLOCK THE WIND. WHEN I'M WARMED UP I LIFT THE LEATHER TO LET THE AIR HIT ME. THE OTHER DOWN SIDE IS I DO FEEL IT ( THE PRESSURE ) IN MY KNEES A LITTLE BIT .OTHER THAN THAT A GREAT MACHINE BUILT WELL
3,Disappointed,"I'm disappointed with this product. The directions for assembly are pitiful. I still haven't been able to get the computer console on the bike. It simply does not fit on the support bars, and even after calling the company, I haven't been able to resolve this issue. I've used it a little bit, but without the console, it isn't that great. It's also much noisier than I thought it would be.The bottom line is that if I had known how difficult it was to assemble properly, I wouldn't have ordered it."
3,Bike is OK...Assembly is a royal pain in the***,"There was NO assembly instruction or diagram contained in the shipment. While it is not too difficult to assemble, the lack of instructions and sequence of assembly made what should have been a one-hour assembly, a two-day affair..."
3,Schwinn Airdyne,"the bike arrived without the coomputer cables and the computer itself was defective. i had to contact schwinn/nautilus for replacement parts; their customer service was excellent, but there's no reason that a new product should have missing and/or defective parts..."
3,just another bike,"I bought this bikes because of the reviews.I wanted to invest in a good bike. I feel this bike is too expensive, we are just paying for the brand but cheaper bikes can do the same job. this bike is not for people who are shorter than 5.7. assemble instructions are of no help you have to guess.if I had the option I'd try to buy another one."
2,GREAT BIKE / LOUSY PRICE,"I wanted to get into shape and after extensive shopping and reviews, I decided on the Schwinn Airdyne. I found this one on Amazon for $499 with free super saver shipping so I put it on my wish list because I needed a few days before I could place my order. The next day the price had been changed to $625. Angry I went to other sources to buy one used. I got one for far less and I didn't have to assemble it. GOOD BIKE -- LOUSY PRICE"
4,"THIS THING BIRTHS HURRICANES, DUDE","After hours and hours of YouTubing and searching for stationary bikes, the Airdyne seemed to be the perfect choice. It was a must-have. However, once I hopped on for an interval session I felt like I was calling for attention to my entire apartment building! Took me a while to assemble because of the same reason others have had issues with -- poor instructions. But eventually it had been built and used.The ups about this machine is how well-built it is, with it's rugged steel construction. It's an awesome looking bike. The operation is quite smooth and fluid. This thing is definitely built to last and it will give you a heck of a workout. Just, you've got to make sure your training area is isolated well with the kind of quality that could muffle an airplane turbine!Great exercise bike to have if you've got a dedicated training area."
5,Best complete body exercise,"I continue to be convinced the Scywinn Airdyne Upright Exercise Bike is the best overall complete body workout available for those of us who want to stay home to exercise. I used my sister's Airdyne (15 years old) for three years. She had foot surgery and needed it back. I have arthritis (especially in knees and back), and can use this bike with no discomfort or pressure. I am 70 years old and want to stay healthy. Therefore, I decided, immediately, to purchase a new Airdyne Upright. My new bike gives me the same exceptional workout as the old bike did; however, the seat is much more comfortable. I now have the perfect exercise equipment I will need for the rest of my life. And, I can use it in my own bedroom, in my robe, watching T.V., in complete enjoyment! My experience with Amazon could not have been better. My bike arrived without a scratch and in record time. Needless to say, I am a completely satisfied customer!"
5,Rating for the Schwinn bike,Just as I expected. Assembly took no more than 30 minutes for me and hubby. No problems or regrets. Saved $150 from what I had priced locally.
2,Dont buy used,"The product I bought works overall good however it's not anything near looking new....very much used. It appeared that it came from a gym, the seat was torn, the peddals are worn and the turbine blades smell of sweat when using this bike."
5,schwinn airdyne ada,I received my schwinn airdyne ad4 about two weeks ago an been riding twice a day for 15 to 20 minutes a day an I'V LOST nine pounds a whole paints size. I love it. thank you greg in tn.
3,Seat is extremely uncomfortable! Ouch!,"The bike is great unless you are a cold-natured person because the fan blows a lot of air while riding. Smooth operation and easy on the joints, but the seat is extremely uncomfortable. The raised areas on the seat are not easy on the bum. The pressure that the raised areas apply causes a lot of pain. They are so uncomfortable that you cannot stay on the bike for more than 15-20 without taking a break, and sometimes, it hurts so bad that you simply quit riding. It is not just me...there are three of us using the bike, and we all agree that the seat absolutely must be changed! If the seat were more comfortable, I could easily stay on this bike and ride for hours."
5,Very high quality engineering and building,"I recently pulled one of these out of an 87 year old hoarder's house. It was buried under all sorts of junk. Not knowing anything about it, but since it looked brand new and I knew that Schwinn is a quality manufacter, I decided not to junk it along with the rest of the stuff. I thought maybe I'd put it up for sale on craigslist or something. That is when I did some research and discovered that this machine is beloved by many, is still valualble, and is built like a tank. While moving it around I took note of the amazing condition and extreme high quality contruction despite obviously being very old. When I finally pulled it out of the back of my truck and set it up in my house I was able to get on it and pedal. Smooth as silk and I love the wind kickback created by the fan. This I think I will keep for myself and leave to my son when I die. No doubt it will still be working then."
3,A good machine marred by bad instructions,"This is a good machine that's been successfully marketed for 30 years or more.But its assembly directions are a disaster. To complete Step 2, for example, you must partially undo Step 1 and invite a friend over to help. The ""exploded"" illustration that is part of the directions does not coincide exactly with the parts list and there's no suggestion of what tools might be needed to complete the assembly.Once the thing is put together, you'll be hard pressed to figure out how to get the computer working; mine is still inert, though the bike itself works just fine after a month.It's a shame that a well designed, useful device is rendered infuriating by the manufacturer's reluctance to spend a few dollars on clear, helpful directions. Don't buy this thing unless you're prepared for a LOT of frustration."
5,Assembly,Only negative is assembly instructions. Diagram is poor- wound up with 4 extra nuts and a plastic part that looks like a flagpole holder.Quality is excellent and it arrived the day it was supposed to (with a phone call the day B4 to make sure I was in).Price was about $60 more for freight than lowest competitor but after reading their reviews it was worth it.Highly recommend buying from Amazon.
2,Schwinn Airdyne AD4 Exercise Bike,Rated low bacause instructions were lacking....had to go to website to determine how to connect sensor cable to wheel hub. Prongs were bent and computer still doesn't work properly.
2,It Broke Repeatedly,The pedals strip easily.Had to replace pedals and pins several times.I gave up.Might work well for a petite person.
1,Do not buy -- no assembly instructions,"This product was shipped to me without any assembly instructions.The Amazon.com customer service only gave me a phone number to Schwinn.This is a very common recent problem with this product and severalrecent reviews have repeated the SAME COMPLAINT!!It is not our task to follow up with Schwinn if they sell anincomplete and hard to assemble product that lacks assembly instructions.Amazon.com should use its vast buying power to force Schwinn to supplydetailed assembly instructions or else do the honorable and responsiblething and stop selling this product.There is also another posting here that claims that assemblingthe product at home voids the warranty. I don't know how true that is.However, there is a lot to beware of before buying this product.Please stop buying this product till Amazon.com fixes the problem."
4,Knee therapy for my wife,"We purchased the Schwinn Bike primarily for my wife to use to keep her new knees limber.It arrived in a nice big box. It was reasonably easy to unpack and I had no trouble with the assembly. The instructions were clear, all the parts were there and they all fit. My wife uses it on a daily basis and wouldn't be without it. She likes the fact that it excercises arms and legs at the same time. We highly recommend this product"
5,Excellent Bike!,I love this bike! I have already had some great workouts using it. Great build quality and perfect old school design.My purchase and delivery from Amazon was painless. I would definitely do this again.Highly recommended!
1,A Travesty,"Wonderful performer, wonderful performances, but the idiot who compiled this DVD decided in his/her wisdom that it would be better in a 'widescreen' rather than the original 4:3 format... so unfortunately Zarah looks overweight, short and dumpy owing to the image being stretched. If you want to know why Zarah was feted as a beauty you won't find it on this DVD where she looks like a plump barge. The sound is OK but save your money and buy a CD compilation rather than this travesty. One star only for the sound track."
4,experements,"The best songs are Burning bridges, pusysugar and daughters down!!! they experement with new vocal ""sounds"" in this and...??"
3,heidikakes or whoever you are you really need a life,first off i dont care what my writing looks like here right now a certain reviewer is in need of a serious attitude change for one this album may not be the greatest but it is not near as bad as some people would have you believe. and second of all heidi what kind of person are you to be so trite and not have any energy to even write some reviews that are diffrent or are you that stupid. and 3rd of all dont be so cheep and buy a cd player if you dont want to play cds in your computer. ok i think i am dont venting now and i will recomend this cd it is better than oracle but only just par to spit
1,i wanted to like this,"i really wanted to like this until the end bu theres too many things wrong with it. the drummer isnt verry good and at times sounds like shes banging on cans similar to lars on metallica's st. anger. the vocals are week and she is very monotone she doesnt change her scream or offer any depth at all. the guitars are the same way its a few power chords no solos no technical riffs nothing. all in all they sound lik ea subpar metal band because thats what they are. if they werent young pretty women they wouldnt be popular at all. this reminds me of drain sth, another all-girl group from the late 90s who wanted to be alice in chains but failed in everyway. the only reason they were popular was because they looked like supermodels. while kittie definitly doesnt look like supermodels the fact their girls makes depressed goth girls want to aspire to be them and sad goth boys want to date them. thats the only way i can see someone likeing this music becuz its that bad."
1,This doesnt even deserve 1 star,First off i hate the vocals on this album they suck the screaming doesnt change and sounds the same on every song on this cd if you want a real metal band look into in flames meshuggah soilwork or opeth they are much more talented than this band by far and are much more worthwhile to listen NO TALENT WHAT SO EVER ON THIS CD!!!!!!!!!
4,Good Death Metal/Gothic Metal Band,"Kittie is awesome. They put a good mix of screaming and singing together and make something good. If your a teenager like me, this is a good way to drive your parents crazy, though my mom likes the song ''career suicide''. Kittie is awesome."
1,"This...well, Danny got the points down","Ya I gotta say I've always hated Kittie because they were useless to begin with. We already had Otep and this is just a filler for fat Goths. Slayer, Cryptopsy, and Megadeth would tear these b****** to shreds. Listen to any of them and Kittie will be a thing of the past soon forgotten. BTW this album is terrible in all aspects."
4,Kittie reaches the sky once again,"This album really is good. It's amazing actually. This album has a bit more soft songs than on Oracle, and has a bit more singing but it doesn't change the fact that this album is incredible. Although all the singing and the soft songs, the songs who ARE heavy are heavy as hell! And Morgan's scream has truly gotten better. Listen for yourself..."
2,Not good enough,"Ok...in their first album they manage to get some publicity with those reviews ""chiks on the metal scene"",but actually the album was a pretty piece of crap,it had NOTHING,only 5 chiks triyng to play something ""dificult"" and doing a lot of noise,(...),dressing and looking has bad has they could...c'mon man, give me a break...with this album, these girls proved they STILL dont have enough ""musical school"" to play this kind of metal, and you see that during the album, a lot of screaming,but what about the guitars?what about drums?does Kittie have a bassist?I have 3 girls on my band,im no ""macho man"",and I know they share my opinion."
1,Kittie just aint Kittie!,"Far out is this just Morgans band now? i brought the CD and theres 10 tracks and basically everything on it is just about done by Morgan.Id have to say from the reviews ive read on here id agree with Scott Hall the most Kittie hasnt been the same since them 2 left. Although i think Orcale was still a good album , this album has droped even more from where Kittie used to be.But who em i kiding this isnt Kittie this is Morgan and friends really."
4,for all you people...,"okay. one thing im not entirely sure of (and this is for all those people who hate the band because their not ""death metal"" or whatever...)did the band actually say straight out ""this is my genre.""? i doubt it, but its possible.its the people that (usually) label the music, not the band. if you dont like it, then dont listen to it, but dont make a speech on how you hate it because its not ""this type"", thats stupid and immature. I (this is MY opinion) think that this album gets a four star rating **** because, well this isnt their best album, but it is still good. You know, you can branch out and listen to other genres, it wont hurt your pride."
3,This proves girls can rock out.,"In an effort to add more female artists to my collection, I heard about Kittie through a close friend of mine. I heard ""Into the Darkness"" and decided to check them out. I bought Until The End and although not blown away by it, it wasn't that bad. My metal collection is rather limited, but this album makes a fine addition, and it proves girls can indeed rock as hard as the guys. It's a good album if you like Kittie, but for real good heavy metal, I'd look elsewhere."
1,LOOK MA I HAVE NO TALENT!,"I RATHER LISTEN TO WINGER AND EUROPE THAN THESE DEPRESSED LITTLE GIRLS!SAY NO TO KITTIE!SAY YES TO ISIS, CONVERGE, MESHUGGAH, DILLINGER ESCAPE PLAN, ARCH ENEMY OR EVEN BRITNEY SPEARS WHO COULD FLIP THESE LITTLE PANSIES LIKE A BURNT HAMBURGER!"
1,Might as well add my name to the kittie haters,"To the fan mad that many people hate kittie is get a life, a female friend of mine loved kittie, she said that this band was so hardcore, I noticed this band has blek guitarring and basslines and double bass drumming that is very subpar. The singer Morgan tried to sound like she knew how to scream or growl, she could do jacksh*t, she aint death metal, a good guitarrist and Chris Barnes could destroy her in growling. It is just the same type of (..) that many female metal bands do, just like pop artists and emo bands, ""the boy I like hates me and I miss my boyfriend, boo-hoo"" . Listen to Arch Enemy and Obituary instead. PS. Big ups to Danny on your review.."
2,Kittie ?,"I brought the cd today and it only has 10 tracks! 3 years for 10 tracks!!! :| the last song isnt even really a remix either...Its more like Morgan and co now not Kittie Morgan has basically done everything on this CD mabey thats why she kicked out Fallon and that other chick because they had input who no's alls i no is Kittie just isnt Kittie anymore...Id recommend Sevendust or Fear Factorys new CD's , all though to be fair some of the tracks arnt bad 30 bucks for 10 trachs is a bit of a rip if you ask me.."
1,you're about to lose a fan.,"I've been a fan of Kittie since the original lineup years ago and I must say I am disappointed with their newest release Until The End. It just lacks what made Kittie so great. Morgan continues trying to convince everyone she can hang out with the big boys. We know you can Morgan, you proved that on your last album. You're tough, we know. If I wanted a metalcore album I would've bought Hatebreed. I mean you stole half the riffs from them anyway. I wanted a Kittie album though! Please go back to the Kittie we fell in love with. We miss you."
4,Stanislaw Ulam and other mathematician lives.,"The very first time I heared from Stanislaw Ulam was reading a book by Otto Robert Frisch (What little I remember). In this book he said that a polish mathematician called Ulam was doing mathematics for the Hydrogen Bomb but his maths were deviating so much from abstract that he even used numbers with decimals in his formulas. This funny comment opened my curiosity to know more about this guy doing maths. Well, years later I bought this book and surprisingly he mentioned the comment by O.R Frisch. What a coincidence! I liked the book. He details his life and other genius lives: John von Neuman, Paul Erdos, Fermi, etc. No necessity to know maths. No formula within the book. Easy to read. Stan Ulam was co-father of the Hydrogen Bomb but everybody knows Edward Teller but not him. He makes especial emphasis in Alamos times (Ulamos times). Enjoyable book."
5,math autobiography and atomic bomb history,"this is one of the few books i've read twice. i'm fascinated by brilliant minds like ulam, oppenheimer, feynman, and von neumann. it's one of the best science biographies/autobiographies and is very easy to read. lots of time is spent on the atomic and hydrogen bomb projects and the great minds/peculiar personalities involved. it's been 15 years since i read it, but now that i've found it again, i'll reacquaint myself with these great and interesting minds. it's not a math book by any means, but a book about brilliant men that do math. they definitely listen to a different drummer."
4,"Easy to read, interesting book about Ulum",This is a very easy to read book about the life and work of one of the great modern mathematicians. Especially interesting are the sections relating to the development of the atomic and hydrogen bombs.
2,Uninteresting book,Mr. Ulam was a great mathematician and scientist; however he was not an interesting writer.If the book had been written about him insterad of by him the writer could have told his story more boldly
2,"Well written, but even more content-free than is expected","I used this book in a mathematics ""bridge"" course that I took at North Dakota State. The book does provide a very gentle transition from proofs into calculus, but it lacks any content. Sure, these courses are supposed to be content-free, but this book doesn't even cover the fundamentals of propositional logic (hypothesis, conclusion, contrapositive, converse, negation, quantification, etc.)! If you want to learn induction and play with Fibonacci numbers, this might just be the right book for you. Otherwise, look for something like Smith, Eggen, and St. Andre (A Transition to Advanced Mathematics) or even Gries and Schneider (A Logical Approach to Discrete Math, which is in the Springer series in computer science but I feel would do just fine for a ""bridge"" course targeted at math majors and more).Also, this book is now print on demand, so it comes as a poorly bound paperback edition that is essentially a photocopy of the real book."
3,Nothing remarkable,"This record is clearly not that great crossover album between dance music and art-rock that it claims to be. TPL seem to be a remix duo from Britain, but they're almost unknown even in ""techno-friendly"" Germany. However, what they do with Marillion's music is not very interesting or innovative. They just strip away the original instrumentation (except for some guitar sounds on ""Estonia"") and lay down some standard acid house sequencers and rhythms. ""The memory.."" is quite good, but nearly every track contains too much idle motion. I wouldn't say that this is a remix album, it is just a TPL album with the vehicle of Steve's whiny voice. According to the booklet, Steve thinks that TPL make music with emotional depth, but this album is rather cold and sterile. There is much more beautiful music coming from other techno artists. Listen to Autechre's ""Amber"" (see my review there) or Aphex Twin's ""Selected Ambient Works""."
2,Nothing but a rehash,"Others such as Stanton Glantz have written much earlier books about these same ""secret"" tobacco papers which are far superior to this one. There are no really new revelations that I found here. This book seems to jump all over the place, a little personal testimonial mixed with quotes pulled from tobacco industry papers, a very boringly presented historical timeline for the origins of tobacco use in the western world, some not very funny tobacco humor, and information about boycotting products like Nabisco crackers! A little this, a little that, probably thrown together to pad the work to be thick enough to call it a book. It reads more like a high schooler's term paper than a serious investigative report about the tobacco wars. It's surprising that it ever got published."
4,more than a tribute,"These guys may well of played alongside Bird but in doing this tribute concert took his style and tunes beyond his era and into the future and stamp it all their own. What marks this as a perfect All Star line-up is that not one of these musicians sets out to be the ""Star"", all playing with the pure essence of the music central to the occasion; sure to be in the celestial collections of Monk & Parker!"
1,will not last,"We've owned these chairs for four months and they've fallen apart. They were being used in a playroom with five young children, with average appropriate usage, and the joints are so rickety, the chair will no longer stay together. I'm very disappointed. This is one instance where I used Amazon reviews to gauge this purchase, and I am not pleased at all. Pass this product over."
1,Poor Assembly Quality,"I ordered these two extra chairs to go with a matching table and two chairs under a separate stock number. Of the total of four chairs, three were fine. The forth had a factory misassembly. The parts could not be assembled as delivered. I had to remove the under-the-seat brace, drill new holes and reattach the under-seat brace to get the leg assembly to fit the chair properly and to properly align the predrilled screw holes in the leg assembly. The table in the matching order assembled OK, but the top had a split in it. I had to repair the split, sand and refinish the table top prior to giving to my grandson. This table/chair combo is of very poor quality."
2,Not as good as expected,"These chairs arrived and were assembled for our grandchildren for Christmas. The finish on the chairs was somewhat poor: there were fingerprints in the finish coating, there were areas that weren't stained/varnished evenly, and there was an area on the front of one chair back on which a glob of glue had gotten on it (prior to staining/varnishing). I removed the glob, and now there is an area of unfinished wood. We kept the chairs, but they weren't the quality product we expected."
1,Boo this isn't STAR TREK!,"When I go and spend $500 on Amazon.com I expect quality and quick shipping. While this product was immediately delivered to me (MAGIC!!!) the content was a complete bore. I thought this would be about Star Trek: Enterprise's Season 5 and the use of Linux on the ship but NOOOO it's about boring products from IBM and HP.I mean come on I could have taken this $500 and bought some Linux software, oh no wait LINUX IS FREE!If you're expecting Captain Archer and T'Pol don't bother. This is about as exciting as Entrapment starring Catherine Zeta-Jones and Sean Connery."
1,This is Rotten!,"I hate this album. It is all cover songs, done by bands that ALL have a style that is, well, Different, and I mean that in a bad way. I liked every one of these songs, when they were first released. I've even heard some of them covered and liked those versions also. However, none of the tracks on this CD are even remotely recognizable as the songs as originally done. Not even close. In fact, they are so far away from it, that I'm keeping the album to use as a party game, called 'Guess The Song'. The first person to guess correctly wins a prize. Extra credit, of course, if they know the original recording artist. Like I said, I hate this album, so unless you want some extremely odd renditions of some really good music, I wouldn't buy it. Oh, if you're looking for something to dance to, however, this CD does have a good beat, and in all fairness, it would be a great CD to dance to."
2,6 treatments out of one syringe....LIE,"The bleaching gel is fantastic!!! However, each syringe has a huge air bubble that does NOT allow you to get 6 treatments. You can possibly get 3-4 treatments per syringe. Highly disappointed!!!"
2,empty syringes,Each of the little syringes has a VERY big air bubble in it that cuts the contents down by about 40% - what a cheap trick!
2,Poorly formatted,"This book may be useful, but it's hard to tell, frankly, because the formatting in the ebook is atrocious. There are passages that are so broken up that they are virtually impossible to understand - think half of a word per page in some places, for several paragraphs! Considering that they have the temerity to charge full price, this amounts to a complete rip-off.The content that is legible is mostly platitudes that might be useful for the total novice."
4,Mid-Range for little $$$,"The speakers are mid-range for a good price. One of the speakers was dead right out of the box so that was dissapointing, but it probably was an isolated case."
2,Don't buy it!!!,"This system just has too many hastles... The cords for the speakers are too short, if you turn the volume control just SLIGHTLY, the music goes WAY TOO LOUD! And eventually, my speakers started to fade in and out and I'm sure it's the speakers because when I plug in another set, works fine! So don't bother wasting your time or money!"
3,Not the biggest or best collection of 90's hits,"But it does help to complete your collection of songs. This CD has a nice selection of 1-off hits that you are not as likely to find on other compilations. So, if you are looking to fill some gaps in your collection, this may be a good buy, but if you want something to listen to from front to back I suspect you will be disappointed in the ""total"" listening experience as many songs are just not that 'good'. Their similar 80's collections offer a much bigger/better collection of 'hits' than this 90's compilation.Sound quality is fine.Also, the infamous copy protection is annoying when ripping the songs to your hard drive, but not that hard to work around. ""Cancel"" the software updates prompt and use WMP 9 instead of WMP 11..."
4,creepy,"When I was a kid (maybe 8 or 9) I remember seeing this on the TV with my Dad (a big fan of 50's sci fi), and I thought it was the scariest thing I'd ever seen. Frankenstein didn't even begin to compare. Recommended, but don't show it to your kid, unless you want them to wake up screaming."
1,Dumb brainshow...,"...lacks action where someone drives off cliff, then his friend shoots himself but how is it this friend comes back to life? Best experience of this film is seeing lew ayres, his friend-(unknown name actor who was in the giant behemoth),""nan"" reagan acting here & the ending w/ the brief storm f/x. Pretty plain, boring movie, sadly to say, just like its aka-lady & the monster."
4,Great lesser known title!!,"Donovan's Brain is a perfect example of how enjoyable a good 50's sci-fi flick can be. Great script and solid acting with adequate special effects makes this one a real winner.I enjoyed this brainy excursion and think it has great potential for repeat watchability. If you enjoyed this film, I also strongly recommend Creature With The Atom Brain, another very enjoyable sci-fi effort with a similar story."
4,Pretty Good Entertainment,"I was recently in a book store and saw the audio tape version of Donovan's Brain. As I was taking a trip across the US, I thought it would be fun to listen to Curt Siodmak's novel. I listened to it three times. When I got to my destination, I checked Amazon to see if the movie was available on DVD. It was. I ordered it. I watched it several times noting that the movie version generally followed the novel. The movie stands up pretty well against comtemporaneous competition. It's not in the same class as Citizen Kane or The Godfather, but it's pretty good entertainment. The script, acting, direction and cinematography (although black and white) all work together to bring a B movie into the A category. It beats most of today's movies that have access to far larger budgets and far better technology."
5,You are not alone!,"My applause to Ken Rogers for articulating his lived experience of post traumatic stress disorder. As a mental health practitioner familiar with treating children and adults who have suffered trauma, I join Ken in his hopefulness that spreading the message, ""you are not alone,"" to our public servants will support them in their struggle to reclaim their lives and heal from the hurt of PTSD.Carol A. Chambers, PHD, LLP, LPC Limited Licensed Psychologist, Licensed Professional Counselor"
4,The soul of the man,"When I was in London in September 2006, I visited the British Museum. The first exhibit I saw as I entered the building was of the paintings and writings of Tagore. I was deeply moved by his inspiring words and decided I needed to read more, know more, about this man. I found this anthology to be just what I was looking for. It contains his words, and gave me insight into the man behind them. Certainly his words reveal the soul. A ""can't miss"" if that is your aim."
3,Volume 6 - It's eh,"Despite this being the penultimate volume of the manga, with the lotis masters battling to save Mayura from Darva, I still am left with the feeling that not much happened. Several of the characters have to battle the darkness of their past, during which we learn more about them, but it feels rushed and really doesn't have much of an impact. The ease with which the characters are able to overcome these things thanks pretty much only to Alice's tearfully shouted words of encouragement, is a little hard to accept, even with the whole suspension of disbelief that's required for a magical girl series.If I had to cite the strongest reason for recommending this manga, I would probably say that the boys (particularly Frey) are pretty. The story is so-so, and if the art were likewise, I probably wouldn't have continued with it as far as I have. That said, having invested all this time and money, I am at least mildly interested to see how the inevitable ending is achieved."
2,Your better off being creative on your own,These cards are kind of like someone sitting down and brainstorming in about two minutes to come up with some of the stupidest repetitive ideas ever. Your better off doing it on your own.
4,Very Big Bite,"Having completed my honors thesis on the structure and function of REM sleep, I feel that I know a bit about the subject of dreams. I have read myriad scientific articles by J.A. Hobson and even another of his books, entitled Sleep. I got about 50 pages into this one and realized I still may have bitten off a bit more than I could chew. The audience Hobson was aiming at here must be the scientific community because I found myself skipping paragraphs at a time because of the tedious detail of neuro-pathways and receptor information that Hobson plows through with an expectation that the reader will need little or no introduction or explanation of the complex neuroanatomy and chemistry that he discusses. He is a great writer, but unless you are a neurochemist, I would recommend one of his other books on the topic of dreams and sleep."
3,"Not to nitpick,","but the movie ""Balance of Terror"" was based on is ""The Enemy Below"" starring Robert Mitchum and Curt Jurgens, not ""Run Silent, Run Deep"". I love this episode in spite of its rather bizarre idiosyncracies: firing the phasers that look like torpedoes from a separate control room instead of the bridge. Mark Lenard was great, pure and simple."
3,Nice transfer of two pretty good earlyTreks,"Two good early episodes of classic Trek, though ""Balance of Terror"" is by far the better. The other episode is not bad, but I always hated when they used little kids as the terror of the week on ""Star Trek"". Having said that, ""Charlie X"" is not nearly so terrible as the unwatchable ""And the Children Shall Lead"" from the third season. Anyway, enough rambling on-- this DVD offers great picture and sound, and these episodes never looked better."
3,"PARAMOUNT,PLEASE TAKE NOTE.","Please note,Paramount,that there are Star trek videos of the original series(released in Britain,Australia etc)that have introductions by original cast members(James Doohan,George Takei etc).Why not put these on the DVD's as well?"
2,"Great toothbrush, bad battery! Stay away!","I owned both Cybersonic 2 and Cybersonic 1 versions. I have to say that it is a pretty revolutionary toothbrush. Very easy to use and cleans exccellent without a doubt. The only problem is the battery! It usually dies very fast and cannot be replaced. Fast means even in few weeks. I followed all charging instructions, yet had no luck. This is not a single case, even a replacement toothbrush from ""Bed Bath & Beyond"" had the same problem. I've had 3 of these, but I finally got the clue! My recommendation to you is stay away from this product, it is probably a waste of your money. Moreover, Amden Corp. which is the manufacturer of this product is known for their horrible attitude and customer service. They were reported to the Better Business Bureau by hundreds of unsatisfied consumers."
2,Design defect,"The size,the performance and handling are the best on market. The problem is with the on/off push button. The first one I had lasted 6 weeks before the on button stuck in the ""On"" position and ran out and wouldn't work again.I went through a lot of time and hassle before they replaced it. They lost the first one I sent back so it took two months to get the replacement. The replacement they sent me lasted over a year before the same thing happened again.This is disappointing. I am going to send this one off like the other one, maybe things will go better this time."
5,Nek's music is great,"If you liked Nek's first album in Spanish, you'll love this one, his music flows perfectly throughout the album, and he shows once again his mature, smart and love-oriented lyrics. Do yourself a favor, buy it."
2,works ok but fabric is torn already on message orbs,the messager works ok but the fabric that covers the messaging orbs has torn open already.
3,HoMedics Shiatsu Neck Massager,Not particular comfortable but seems to help soften the neck muscles. Cord always seems to be in way. This is one-size fits all solution so this could be a problem depending on width of neck.
4,GOOD MASSAGER,"LIKE OVERALL PRODUCT. OTHERS IN FAMILY FEEL IT IS TOO ROUGH. I THINK ITS GREAT, BUT I DO HAVE ONE PROBLEM. I HAVE A BIG NECK AND THE MASSAGER CAN'T GET TO ANY OF THE SIDE MUSCLES. HAVEN'T TRIED IT ON OTHER BODY PARTS YET. OTHERWISE, IT REALLY DOES THE TRICK."
4,Great at Getting Out the Deep Knots,"I just got this for Christmas, and I wish I'd gotten it years ago! It's great for getting out the deep knots - the knobs feel like thumbs (the thumbs of someone really strong). You can target right on that one spot that hurts - for me, it's around my shoulder blades. Ahhhhh heaven!"
3,Just OK this time around for HoMedics,"I love this company-and have always appreciated its product line. (I own 6 of them) But there is just not enough power in the SM-100 Shiatsu Massager to be really effective. It's not a ""bad"" product--it's just not up to this companys usual standards when it comes to being effective and reaching deep enough into the muscles to bring real relief. In fairness, it should be noted that the cost of the SM-100 is very reasonable; that is, it's not over priced for what it is and what it does. If you need minor relief in the neck area, I suppose this might do the job."
2,Not as good as expected,"I also own the Homedics Shiatsu Back Massage SBM-200 (EXCELLENT! 4 stars!)and had high expectations for the SM-100. I find it to be noisy, uncomfortable and hard to maneuver. My massager has a bad odor from the manufacturing materials. I would not buy it again. On the plus side, it is inexpensive and has a nice long power cord, but I prefer my old handheld percussion massager for the neck and upper back. I hope this helps..."
3,HoMedics SM-100 Kneading Shiatsu Massager with head-rest,It does a good job of massaging but really needs a second person to apply it to those sore areas you can't quite reach. It's a bit heavy to hold after a bit so some of the relaxation is lost.
2,Loud and for larger necks,"I am a fit female with a lot of neck and shoulder stiffness. The mechanical thumbs are spaced pretty far apart, so if you are not a man or a larger woman, this probably wont work great for you. Plus it is a lot louder than I expected. I could even deal with that, but having to use one thumb at a time is ridiculous. The thumbs are working away, on either side of my neck, just not ON my neck, lol. I am 5'6"" 120 lbs (average size). This is product is probably great for normal sized men and heavy set women."
3,"Better than nothing, but not very recommendable.","I ordered this a couple years ago as I work on computers all day long and often end up with a tense neck at the end of the day. I am an average person with the average sized neck. It seemed like the ""fingers"" were too small and since they're in sync had the high potential to pinch the crap out of my neck when they met in the center. I also found the sound of the machine while operating to be distracting during use, and because I was so concerned about the pinching I didn't fully relax enough for it to work. Maybe I shouldn't relax that much it could really get a good grab of the skin on the back of your neck!"
2,LOVE THE UNIT BUT THE ROLLERS BREAK,"This is the second HoMedics Shiatsu style unit I've owned and both have ended up with broken rollers. This type of roller has a specific purpose for digging into those hard to reach places in the neck and right below the shoulder blades. Maybe I'm just too rough on it! I've switched to the HoMedics back pillow and like it very much. You can see my review on the problem I had with it, though."
3,massager,massager was ok but not greatthe design is good but the massager could be betterwill try to find a better massager
2,Marybe if your neck is really big.,"I'm petite and bought this thinking I could get a good neck and shoulder massage out of it. Unfortunately, the massagers are too far apart to massage my neck. It's ok for the shoulders, but also doesn't seem to be made for someone my size."
3,great!!,The product is great. I just wish it had a button or something to make the massagers come closer together. But otherwise its good.
1,Maybe if you have a very wide neck?,"The massagers are spaced too far apart to actually touch my neck. My boyfriend tried it and had the same experience & he's one of those wide necked body builders. If one of us held it in place on the other then it was a little too intense, bordering on painful. We were both disappointed in it and ended up giving it away at a stoop sale."
5,HoMedics SM-100,I love this product. I sit in my recliner and put it behind my neck. I found that this works better for me. I think too much pressure is put on the neck when lying down. I feel relaxed after using it.
1,HoMedics Shiatsu Massager Disappointing,"I bought the Shiatsu Massager as a birthday present for my husband. He always has this pain in his upper back and his neck, so this sounded perfect. Needless to say I was disappointed. If your neck is not the perfect size, forget this product. My husband is not overweight and his neck barely fit in the device. It did no good for his shoulder pain at all, either. He tried putting his lower leg into it to massage his calf and again, the leg was not the perfect size to fit in the massager. I didn't like that it only had two directions and one speed."
3,Shiatsu Massager,"This massager overall does what it's supposed to do, but it's not as comfortable as it appears. The short front digs a little into the shoulders and so you have to adjust yourself to find the most comfortable position which may not be the best relaxing position. The head rest does not work for me. If I'm using it my head is raised too high to feel the effects of the kneading thumbs. Maybe it depends on the size of the persons head and neck to get the right effects. It would be better if one can somehow adjust the width of the thumbs. I do use it though and if I maneuver myself correctly and get the right spot, it is worth having."
5,It helps,"For this price, you can't expect a lot but I received more utility from it than I thought I would.First of all, I prefer intense, deep massage. In order to get close to this, the first thing I did was to dump the pillow so the little critter could reach up and grab my neck. The range of motion requires me to position it for the lower neck for a while and then the upper neck.It also worked pretty good on my calves even though I kept having to reposition it or my leg to get full coverage.After about 20-30 minutes of use (neck and legs) it starts squealing to let me know it needs a break. Actually I think it's probably overheating or something. Switch it off for a couple of hours and it's ready to go again.When comparing the price vs performance, I have to give this a 5 star. If I ignored price, the star rating would probably drop.Bottom line: I have no regrets on the purchase but doubt I'd buy another if this one ever fails.Mark H"
4,Massager,"Wonderful product. Have used on legs as well as shoulders. Still have more to learn, but really like it!"
4,"It's not a human, but it's cheaper and doesn't talk back! :)","I love this product, even with the gripes. It does provide a good massage for the neck. I used it before and after my disc fusion surgery (once the fusion was complete, not before!) and it really is relaxing.My gripes are the plastic is uncomfortable to lay the head on (the plastic pillow thing isn't much help; a removable inlaid pad via velcro on the front would be better for use and for cleaning) and that it cannot be used in bed. Well, I did use it in bed and had no real problems with it, but they must say ""don't use it in bed"" for a good reason. (fire risk?) But the pros outweigh the cons and it is a surprisingly sturdy little device too (used it over a year now, no problems yet.)Especially at $30, it saves the cost of many trips to a massage therapist or mate who doesn't have the time to rub your neck (or vice-versa) either - though I do miss having a person to talk to... especially when money's tighter than my muscles. :("
1,Doesn't do the job,The machine did not offer enough pressure or flexibility for use.The instructions indicate you are to rest your neck or foot in between the rollers. While the effect was mildly pleasant and relaxing it certainly didn't massage adequately. The pressure was very weak. Same experience using it on my feet.Save your money for something better.
3,It's just ok.,"It's just ok. It works good, but I don't think it massages hard enough, to work the knots out. Not as easy to hit ""just the right spot"" as I thought it would be. It's ok, but I don't know that I would buy this same thing again."
4,worked well,"I'm not sure of it's medicinal use, but the massager worked well. It does slow down when you lean into it, but it can give you a pretty good rub, but takes time (2-3min) and some movement. I really do enjoy it. First I've found that actually works."
1,very disappointing!!!!!,"Picture shows a stiff hat that stands up. In reality the hat is soft and floppy and will only stand up as a stove pipe hat if you do something to it. For example, we had to stuff it with newspaper, so it sort of stood up, but it was really very disappointing and seems like false advertising."
3,Worked like a charm.,"If you follow the directions correctly and have some idea of what your doing than these work great. YES, they are plastic which kind of stinks because they will great easier but if you are careful they slip on like a glove. They look great and they are pretty tight against the wheel. I tried pulling one off pretty hard and it didn't budge. Overall they're a good product. I'd but these over any wal-mart brand hubcap any day."
2,You get what you pay for!,"Two of the four hubcaps cracked on installation! These are plastic. They come with a cheap metal ring that is theoretically designed to strengthen the clips, BUT there are no metal clips! Just plastic. I didn't have a rubber mallet so I used my hands/fist. I'm a small woman, so I know I didn't exert an unusual amount of force to cause the breakage. I'll keep them because they look better than nothing."
3,Looking For Answers,This book wasn't what I thought it would be. The answers I'm looking for aren't in this book.I'll keep looking elsewhere.
2,Cushion doesn't hold up,"This is one of those deals that you get what you pay for. I need the lumbar support but didn't know if i could tolerate a pillow. It worked well at first then after a month, it begin to flatten out. It has now mostly lost it's shape. Spend a little more and get a better pillow."
3,gets out of shape with use,"this pillow is okay but it gets out of shape after a week's use...not sure how to ""fluff"" it up again.It does help my back...just by having something in that space against my lower back"
3,"good price, decent product...","..the only drawback is that there is no strap to hold the pillow in place and that the thickness of the pillow is rather large. i have to recline my bucket seat far back so that my chest isn't close to the steering wheel. other than that, i'd recommend for short term results."
1,Poor Lumbar cushion,Cushion is only ok. Compresses after limited use and does not hold its shape very well. After using it for daily driving for approx. 1 month it is half of the original thickness.
2,Didn't hold up,"I purchased this cushion, as I needed some additional back support in the car. It worked like a dream for a week or two, then flattened to about 50% of the original thickness.I'm still using it, but it provides minimal support."
2,Flattens / loses its shape,I've used this product for a few months and it has completely lost its shape. It is now flat and more or less useless. The cushion is very soft and doesn't hold its shape. It's relatively useless now. A little pillow would be just as effective
2,"too soft, deformed very quickly.","I recently injured my back in a car accident, so I purchased 2 lumbar support cushions. One for work and one for car. I used this one for my car since I spend less time there than on my office chair. YOU REALLY GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR! this one was cheaper than the other one, and it definitely feels like it. It helps to a certain extent, but listen to me when i tell you that you should spend the extra ~$8 dollars and get the one with actual form and support - totally can tell the difference. I even let my coworker test it out, the more expensive lived up to its purpose.here is the link to the other Lumbar I purchased:http://www.amazon.com/Duro-Med-Relax-Bac-Insert-Strap/dp/B000HLWG72/ref=dp_cp_ob_hpc_title_1"
3,A little squishy and a color surprise!,"This was a little more squishy than I would have imagined. And, because the disclaimer says ""colors may vary"" it will be a surprise as to what color you get. Other than that, I will still keep it as it does what I need."
3,Too soft,"It's OK, but too soft for me. The Duramed lumbar cushion I purchased previously has much better support. I also don't care for the fabric used to cover it. I have a dog and the fabric attracts and collects all the dog fur. I purchased this one because the price was right, but next time I'll go with the Duramed."
4,works for me,worked rather well for my back when driving 12 hours a night as a cabbie. And it costs way less than store equivalents.
1,Totally useless,This is not a good product; Buy some thing else for the money. You can find better lumbar support products.
2,Not firm enough - will not hold up,The foam is too soft and the material on the outside is like a nylon stocking that will not hold up. Hard to slide around in the car seat if you have cloth upholstery. No real luimbar support
4,Nice back support,This back cushion comes in handy when I need extra lumbar support at home or at the movies. I wish it came with a washable cover.
2,Not sure,"I have had this cushion for a short time, it does not look like this any more! I would not buy it again because it does not hold it's shape."
3,Meh,"You get what you pay for. I use this in my car, and after about 4 months of use, it has lost a majority of it's shape.I now have a foam rectangle behind my back more than a lumbar seat cushion. Still gets the job done, just didn't maintain shape and firmness over a pretty short lifespan."
4,Works great in straight backed chairs.,"This cushion is therapeutic for me when I use it in a straight backed chair. If my back is hurting, I can sit in a chair and in a few minutes, the pain subsides.I use the cushion upside down from what the pictures show. Thin part down at the seat of the chair and thick part in my back.It does nothing for me in an office chair or in a car seat.As others have said, the cushion will compress over time and lose some of it's effectiveness. But for the price, I just ordered 2 more of them."
3,not to sturdy,this item is okay for short periods of sitting..it flimsy and not very sturdy at all. But will help support a mild back problem.
2,Not what i was expecting,The pillow is to soft and uncomfortable. It doesn't help my Lowe back at all. Next time I will pay more attention to the reviews.
2,Should have purchased something else,This lumbar cushion does not hold it's shape. I now have a misshapen ball of foam in my driver's seat. It would be nice it it would return to its original shape when not in use. It also doesn't stay in position well (as it looks in the photo). I wouldn't purchase this again. Very poor quality!!
2,Wears Quickly,"The fabric holds it in place great without a strap, but it does wear quickly. The cushion flattens out and mine is now 1/2 of what it used to be after about a month or so."
4,Not bad for the price,"This cushion is very comfortable and retains its shape without being too firm. It doesn't come with any straps or any way to secure it to the seat, so it does move around and fall forward when I get up. Otherwise, I'm happy with it."
2,Had higher hopes for this product,"I found this product very uncomfortable to use, and it really didn't alleviate any back pain I had. I used it in a chair, on my sofa while watching TV, and while driving. It actually seemed to make my back pain and sciatica worse actually. I bought two of them, one for home and one for my car, as suggested by my physical therapist. When these did not work out for me, the company was terrific to deal with. When I called them to let them know of my disappointment, they gladly refunded my money as long as I sent them a picture of the actual product. They didn't even ask me to ship the product(s) back to them. And my refund was received in a very timely manner."
1,Would not buy again.,"After a few uses, the cover begins to stretch and lose its shape. I would not buy this product again."
4,Great,"Love it. My commute is much more comfortable these days. The only thing is that it slides around when I get in and out, but that is a small price to pay (in addition to what I actually paid...)."
3,IT'S ALRIGHT,THIS CUSHION SHOULD HAVE A STRAP ON IT TO HOLD IT IN PLACE. I HAD TO MAKE MY OWN SO IT WOULDN'T FALL DOWN
2,This is not firm enough...,"It is only good for the first 2 weeks... and I drive ~3-4hours per week.This is not firm enough to make it last long... I don't expect it to last forever but it doesn't even last for a month...Just for reference, I am ~145lbs and ~5'9"", I don't SIT ON this cushion but it is very flat already..."
4,great fall tool,I rake to the tree lawn and then wait for the city to pickup the leaves. With Leaf Lock I did not have to re-rake because everything had blown back onto my lawn.
1,Did I miss something here?,"I am a great fan of Bernstein's ""Candide"". I saw the 1974 production twice. My wife saw it three times -- she took a friend once.This DVD should have been an excellent performance. Lupone and Chenowith after all, but the DVD copy I have has such abysmal sound that any enjoyment of the performance is near impossible. Muddy, echoing, not really even a clear visual image.I assumed it was a really bad recording job. Is it just that I have a bad DVD copy?"
2,I repeat Mr. Rarerare's title: NOT BERNSTEIN'S CANDIDE,"My impression was: what a waste of money - why take such a nice play and do it like that? Why? - What's that ""old lady""? What sort of character Mrs. Lupone built? I read the reviews here - and I didn't believe them. I should have had. But there are good moments though - imaginative, creative, although far from funny."
1,Appalling !!!,"I was so excited at hearing that a concert version of Candide was to be released on DVD. I saw a diferent concert production in London in February 2005 and it was outstanding. The one I watched today from New York is appalling beyond words. Kristin Chenoweth and Patti Lupone are dreadful. Glitter and be Gay is ruined by Kristin (SREECH) Chenoweth and Patti is vile as The Old Lady. I love Patti, but she ruined this. Why make the concert so pathetic? Too comic, the choir holding up placards!!!Avoid this at all cost. Watch the video of the Barbican concert, if you have it and listen to the Scottish Opera version on CD. The worst DVD I have ever seen!"
5,The best of all...,"This is truly the best of all possible versions for the sparkling and optimistic Candide.What a production! From the magnificent conducting of Marin Alsop (brava!) to the ever present and participant choir to the cast: great singers, superb actors, pure comedians.Who can find a better ""dream team"": the funny satirical narration/singing of Thomas Allen, chameleonic Jeff Blumenkrantz, baby face but powerful voice of Paul Groves, and the (great) female duo of Patti LuPone -she rules, for Heaven'sake- and Kristin Chenowet.If you are favoring a more ""operatic"" version of Candide probably you would prefer Deutsche Gramphon's directed by Bernstein himself, but if you want a non stopping 116 minutes of top american musical stage and ALSO the purest spirit of Bernstein play, this is the one for you.Finishing the recital you can imagine Mr.Bernstein... alive and enjoying it!"
5,Wonderful!,"This is actually a 2nd copy for us. We played ours for a friend who loved it so we gave it to him. Staged well (for a concert version), well sung (Kristine Chenoweth is...well, her usual incredible self) and very well shot/filmed. Sound quality is terrific too (as it is on most concert versions these days)...full orchestra and chorus.Highly recommend this!"
4,Enjoyable theatre,Although done as an 'in concert' performance - this is a very enjoyable and entertaining rendition of Bernstein's Candide.I highly recommend it for broadway musical fans. There a few times when lines (shadows from wires) appear across the singers' faces but that is almost unavoidable given it is a live production.
4,"Performance 5 stars, DVD quality 3","I have to say that though I would immediately give this five stars just on the production itself, the quality of the DVD sucks. The sound is great...but the camera work is shaky, blurry...the I can't tell if they are moving the camera or trying to pan and scan (though it is in letterbox) but there are times when the digital recording just doesn't mesh with what the camera is doing. Glitter and be Gay is hard to watch because of this. I don't remember it being like this on PBS. But I guess since this is the only version of it on DVD...and the performances by orchestra, stars, chorus and director are all top notch - then by all means get it. Just take a Dramamine before you watch it."
2,Please see the DGG version before you buy a Candide,"Please view Bernstein's DG version with the London Symphony Orchestra before you buy; one really can't beat Christa Ludwig, Nicolai Gedda and Adolph Green with Leonard himself and the LSO. Granted, the PBS version brought the work to a new audience, but the PBS staging is, regrettably, a slapstick comic-book style farce in which the characters are a bit overcooked (director's fault, not the cast's). I have three versions (including original cast recording) and prize the Bernstein version most highly. Do let me know what you think!"
3,Excellent performances; poor filming,"While this simplified production of Candide includes some really stellar work, it's horribly marred by terrible filimg: awful angles, missed shots and shakey cameras. I'm hoping the director of photography never works anywhere again."
3,Delightful production marred by cheaply produced DVD,"Agree with other reveiwers - great music, fun 'concert', etc. But I am dissappointed in the DVD version, as the audio track is poorly compressed to the point of irritation, there are no subtitles included, and no chapter selections. Too bad."
2,A very enjoyable performance,"Until I saw this performance on public TV, I had not liked Candide. But this performance changed my mind, so when I saw it was available on DVD I bought it.Some of the other reviewers critized the fact that it deviated from the origonal broadway production. Since the origonal production was not very sucessful (at least for a Bernstein musical) it seems quite justified to make some changes.The trouble with Candide is that the story in completely ridiculous, so any attempt to play it straight will seem silly. Here, all the performers convey the idea they are having great fun doing this ridiculous musical which makes it fun for the audience too. In addition, the conducting and singing are excellent."
3,Adequate production,"I've heard several recordings of Candide, and saw the Broadway production in the late 70's. Maybe there isn't a ""perfect"" version, particularly since Bernstein kept tinkering with it. The text is so synical I wish it were in a foreign language. How does one ""do"" Candide? Heavy-handed, preachy, as a light comedy, a farce? I'd prefer a straight-forward comic approach that keeps the mean-spirited aspects to a minimum. This version is OK, but lacking what a full-blown production could do. It's somewhat like the concert version Bernstein himself did for PBS."
3,Interesting but very technical and has old film footage,"The film quality is good for a home movie, but with a lot of old, grainy film footage of predatory birds from the movie projector days. It still is interesting. I found it a little too technical, with too few good sequences of bird flight and observance. More for a bird identification enthusiast. Doesn't come close to David Attenborough's 'Life of Birds'."
4,Not All Are Full Versions!,"The songs from these CDs really take you back to church. I was a little disappointed though that a few of the songs that I really liked were not in their full version. Had I known, I may have considered getting the songs another way."
3,Make sure these will fit your guitar before ordering.,I ordered this kit for a Squier Se. (The SE came in a strat pack with amp and accessories) The pickup covers are too shallow and allowed the pole pieces to stick way out. The p-up selector tip was too loose on the switch and kept falling off. I put a bit of tape on the switch to keep the tip on. The rear control cavity plate is way off and dosen't fit. The only thing that fit properly was the control knobs and the tip of the trem bar. Just be careful before you order. I ended up switching back to the original parts.
4,one ply back plate FYI,"The item is pretty self explanatory, so I won't go into details, but there are a few things to mention.Unless you know what you are buying already, the colors are hard to determine from online photos. The back plate that comes with this kit is a mint green color. It more or less matches the color of the Fender Mint Green Pickguard which I also own. However, the backplate is 1 ply, and I guess I had expected it to be 3 ply like the one that was on my strat. Not a big issue, but it's something I didn't see mentioned anywhere online."
3,Made in the USA,I was happy it was made in the USA but was missing switch tip and had two cracked knobs. Might have happen in shipping but switch tip wasn't done by shipping.
5,Fast and great service,This got here a lot quicker than I expected. Product was aged-white like I had hoped for. I can't wait to see how well this will pair up with a cream pearl pick guard and gold hardware.
4,Beauty & function,Perfect...for me anyway. This is just the product I was looking for! The color is a perfect match to what I had.
2,it was a bit deterrant,"at one point i wanted to become a freelance artist,but after reading parts of this book, i wonder if the author is eitherwriting any thing to make some side money , or is afraid of future competition."
3,"Not the best book I've read, but there is some useful information","Some useful information but a bit dated today. I expect an author about graphic design and illustration to have a better looking website and book cover, but hey that's just me. If you can get this book cheap I would snag it up. There are some good points Michael brings up."
4,essential,"so you want to go freelance... you really, REALLY want to go freelance? Tired of working for a boss? Want your own hours? Sleep late? Get this book, read it and then decide. It'll give you a well-rounded education of what they don't tell you in art school because what your professors were really interested in at that time wasn't your education, but getting a piece of co-ed you-know-what while they collected their paycheck."
4,Excellent,I throughly enjoyed the book. I am finding it most helpful. It is easy to follow from chapter to chapter. It gives great ideas to get you started thinking and brainstorming about graphic designing and freelance work.I would highly recommend it to anyone. It is a straight shooter and tells you like it is in the real world of business.
4,a slight return,"One-man band Michael Johnson (aka Reclinerland) offers some of the best aspects of '80s folk-rock, while managing not to sound derivative. Catchy rhythms and infectious melodies are paired with lyrics that range from quirky to poignant. Fans of early REM, Camper van Beethoven, the Connells and Yo La Tengo will find this album a sort of homecoming, while proponents of more recent folk-pop and singer-songwriters will be amazed at the album's simple, heartfelt originality."
4,X-Ray Eyes and other things that go Bump in the Night,Neat little bit of horror. What a great outlandish idea. Ray Milland as Dr. James Xavier raelly plays this one with convinction considering the genre. That's what makes it work.
3,deserves better than this,"now i know every ones siding with this one so please dont cridisise me ok?First of all this is an interesting movie and an interesting idea but i deserves better than this. ok, the budget was measly but no excuss, those scences through the eyes were so cheaply done and most were just a garbled images. the movie was too short for the plot and didnt give time to develope the charicters as well as the ending with ended the movie abruptly, not resolving anything. One question to leave you with, how can he pluck out his eyes in 1/4 of a second? My advise is it is worth seeing at least once. i look forward to seeing the sequal"
4,My candidate for a remake,"Ray Milland stars as Doctor Xavier, a dedicated scientist searching for a better x-ray. He finds it, but he also finds that light isn't all it's cracked up to be.A terrific story with a shocker ending, this is one of those films that cries out for a remake...today's special effects would send this one over the top!"
4,interesting little shocker,"Saw this movie years ago - haven't thought about it again till was reading King's ""Danse Macabre"", which had a long review of the movie....according to King, he heard a rumor that, at the end of the movie, after Milland plucks his eyes out, he screams ""I can still see""."
4,Classic Corman holds up well.,"Long unavailable, X. . . is Corman at his non- Edgar Allan Poe best. Ray Milland is fascinating to watch as the obsessed (but not quite mad) scientist who is using himself as a guinea pig to test his new eyedrops which will allow him to see things no one else has ever been able to see before! Corman regulars, Johnathan Haze, and Dick Miller are here, along with veteran character actor John Hoyt and a good thespian turn by Don Rickles. If your a fan of Corman, mad scientist, or horror relying on suspense and character first, shock effects and gore second--this X is for you. The party scene where the prim and proper Milland suddenly can see under everyone's clothes is a campy delight that must be seen to be believed. And yes the ending was quite gruesome for it's day."
4,Grab a cello and start duck-walking across your living room,"This is a really nice live release from a band that I always didn't expect much from live. I was really surprised at how good it is. The first impression is what a good drummer Bev Bevan is and my next is what a good keyboard player Richard Tandy is. I was impressed with Jeff Lynne's guitar playing. This was a band blacklisted for supposed lip synching. The only place I notice that is on some parts that couldn't be performed live ie the beginning of the Eldorado medley,ect. It's very brief and also obvious when it happens. This is a live performance. I wouldn't list any of the players as being heavyweights in their field(Jeff Lynne is no Eric Clapton for example)however this release is a blast and if you like ELO grab it. The only thing that might bug fans is that the strings are under amplified"
4,An Intimately Small Concert,"I attended this concert and stood right by the stage. It was just like being at a private practice session-- Flawed performance, but real! This album brought back memories of meeting up close the Exaulted One, Jeff Lynne, as he performed on a small stage, close to his fans. This albun is a must for true ELO fans"
1,Rip off,"This is the same album as ""Cheek to Cheek"", music of Fred Astaire. So buy Cheek to Cheek and save a fortune. It's typically terrific as are all Vince Giordano's albums!"
4,vol 2 is amazing..,"my hubby was the dj on vol 2, vol 2 and 3 were def the best of the three :-) happy listening"
5,Get this!,"I couldn't stop playing it. The sound production is so clean and full of bass, the latest freestyle songs mixed up with the finesse of professional dj, no breaks, mesmirizing, it is worth the buy, now I will look for the other volumes of this same title."
1,PACKING,"CYBERSONIC D109 BRUSHES WERE NOT PACKED AS SHOWN IN THE PICTURE,BUT WERE LOOSELY PACKED IN CELLOPHANEBAGS- 2/BAG.I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO MAKE OF IT AS TO THERE NEWNESS.BAD PRACTICE. I HAVE THROWN AWAY THE BRUSHES-LESSON LEARNEDSURINDER"
4,Fresh Teeth,I LOVE this product ... We have had our Cybersonic System for years and still LOVE it!!! This is a really good price for the product!
2,Good Idea but not very well flowed,"I tried to enjoy Go Blue but I just couldn't. The book didn't make any sense to me and the events were predictable. I love Michigan and reading about it, but who wants to hear a story about oil,lawyers,and rock and roll music?"
1,i didn't understand it,I was told to read this novel for a project and i just din't get it...i thought it was dumb and not well complexed
2,Very slow,Worked as expected but very slow. Would get a faster one next time.Battery lasted for about 45min of heavy use.Comes with a nice bag.
5,"Excelente Album, Buenas Rolas, QUE BUEN TRABAJO","Es Lo mejor Que He Escuchado, su primer album lo tengo y me guste pero lo cataloge con 4 estrellas pero este se merece 5(MAS DE 5) es un excelente trabajo muy bien hecho, esto definitivamente va a superar a ¿Que Pides Tu?, Su primer sencillo Es magico es una cancin muy bonita tiene una letra que te hace soñar, Aunque no Te Pueda Ver es sencillamente una de las mejores canciones latinas del 2004."
5,Best CD!!,"I love this CD very much!! I'm a fan of Ubago and when I first heard his music it was like dreaming. He knows how to write and sing. He is a wonderful person. My favorite song on the cd is ""Aunque no te pueda ver"" and ""A Gritos de Esperanza"" I also have his first cd but this one is a lot better. Keep up the good work Alex."
5,Excellent!,"This cd is magnificent and I recommend it to anyone. Alex Ubago has a very smooth melodic voice, it will please anyone that likes Spanish ballads and soft rock. His style is totally unique. I can't say enough about him."
3,Not the Best Out There,"Some of these essays are good, while others are unoriginal and dated.For a better value, check out ""Ivy League Admission: 160 Successful Law School Personal Statements."" You can't go wrong."
5,Perfect interpretations of perfect songs,"What sets this CD apart from other recordings of standards is that you'll hear the words as if they're being said only to you--it's like you're reading a letter from a dear old friend. Kreutz's voice is beautiful (with perfect intonation and diction), his musicians are excellent, and the arrangements elegant, but it's the way all the elements come together so that each song tells a story that makes the CD really special. The title track and ""Blame It On My Youth"" are almost painfully beautiful and moving, and ""Whatever Happened to Melody"" has an unexpectedly chilling ending. If you are looking for ""grown up"" music that will make you think and feel and cry, you'll love this CD."
1,a crappy product,"I bought this product for my aunty. I tried it immediately after I received it. When I tried to plug in the battery, the wire connected to the battery cap just came off. I also tried to put on the mask, I didn't feel comfortable with those nail heads pushing against my face. Honestly I don't know whether this product works to make you look younger, but the design looks really unprofessional and like those cheap toys you can get from any pitch for 10 bucks."
3,Meh,"I read another review for this elsewhere, and the reviewer described this as melodramatic and gave this book a poor rating. I wholeheartedly agree. This book is way to melodramatic to be considered pure history. I wanted the Defiant Archangel book but that's currently 60 bills. This one was cheaper. But it appears to be more of a romance novel. I understand Gabriele D'Annunzio lived his life for myth, but a biography doesn't need to read like a romance novel. Google is currently allowing a snippet preview when you search this book in the book search section. I recommend reading that preview before buying this book. The romance novel-style writing can wear thin at times."
2,If it sounds too good to be true..,"This book is a real dissapointment. The book itself is surpriseingly small. Its about 60 pages and around the size of a video game instruction manuel. The paid safe sex research oppertunities are nothing more than sperm donation. While there are many listings of sperm donation centers through the country, there will probably be only one or two in your area, which could probably be found with a little internet research or a phone book. The other sex oppertunites are teaching tantric sex and adult modeling. Several addresses are given for those oppertunites, but again, much of that information could be found on the internet for free with out a great deal of effort. Five dollars would seem to be a much more approatite price for this book."
5,I Thought This Was Just a Gag Gift!,"When I saw the GET PAID FOR SEX book, I cracked up in hysterics and immediately ordered it for my boyfriend as a joke. The funny thing was that the book turned out to be totally serious and filled with actual job listings. Ever since he got it, my boyfriend has been gleefully pouring through the book like a sex-crazed maniac (which I actually don't mind). But what's starting to worry me is that I'm thinking I might even check out the Internet stripper jobs. Yikes! All I can say is, be careful if you get this book, because it offers up all sorts of wild ideas and possibilities. And yes, they are real!"
1,There are some obvious liers in these reviews.,"Obviously, some of the people writing ""reviews"" aren't real people at all, but someone who works for the book. Some of the good ""reviews"" are word-for-word from the book's own web site."
5,"Very, Very Impressive and Brave and SEXY!","I really enjoy GET PAID FOR SEX and I think Ana Loria has tapped into something that goes deep to the root of our sexuality. Of course, I understand a lot of folks are frightened by her honest account of paid sex opportunities... no wonder so many people have to criticize the book. But I, for one, say YOU GO, GIRL!"
1,YOU BETTER OFF READING THE FREE YELLOW PAGES,"I can reveal the secret of this book in one word, go to the yellow pages and get the secrets of making money in the sex business in the escort section. Nothing that goes on in escort services are illegal - so this is your answer. This little, totally skinny book should cost only five dollars. However the writer of this book came up with a brilliant marketing concept. Her title is awesome. Her concept that there are businesses out here that men can get paid for having sex is totally fascinating. However, let us be real, guys are paying to have sex. Only in the homosexual community will a guy get paid to have sex. However, for those who want to buy this waste-of-time of a publication for novelty purposes, do so. One thing I can say, this book is selling like hotcakes."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS BOOK!,"Straight and to the point: This book does not reveal anything like the cover specifies, it is a 2 cent piece of crap--just a lot of ideas and nothing that would indicated what the cover specifies, you can get everything in this book from the internet for free; if you want to throw your money down the drain for nothing then buy this book!"
1,"laughable, if it sounds to good to be true..............",ZERO STARSA brief synopsis of the book:Provides list ofsperm banks for one to go donate sperm if they are able to passphysical exam...paid (it says about 15 dollars per visit) but not like the book is advertised.ZERO STARS ZERO STARS ZERO STARS ZERO STARS END
1,WHAT BOOK WERE TH PEOPLE THAT GAVE THIS GOOD REVIEWS READING,"THIS BOOK PROVIDED ME WITH ABSOLUTELY POSITIVELY NO KNOWLEDGE OF GET PAID FOR SEX OPPORTUNITIES, IT WAS A TERRIBLE BOOK IF YOU WANT TO CALL IT A BOOK, IT TAKES ABOUT THREE MINUTES TO READ, I THOUGHT IT WAS A TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS BOOK, IT IS A CON."
1,Great Cover---Terrible Book!!!!!!!,"I was over at one of my friend's house--and he had this book---I read it which took about 15 minutes, and was laughing at the thought that somebody woul d actually buy this book, it promises get paid for sex opportunites on the cover with a hot blonde girl but inside the book it gives nothing, just a whole lot of advice and b.s. . I was thinking to myself after I read the book---GEEZ I CANNOT believe I just wasted 15 minutes of my life reading this book---when I could have been doing anything else----just a terrible book--sold to those seeking free sex opportunites when in fact it provides absolutely nothing...Zero star(s)."
1,Crap!,"Used three times...now it cuts on and off while using. Never had a drop of water enter the housing yet, it does not work properly.Customer Service is also crap!"
2,Too fragil and sensitive... breaks easily,"For a ""heavy duty"" ""professional"" ""for rental"" equipment, sooo heavy (outside the water) it breaks very easyly.It's exactly because its electronic chips, that are supposed to be there to PROTECT the machine, stopping the unit automatically when it gets wet (inside, of course) or anything else...It happens that those electronics are the WEAK part of both the unit and the batteries. One came DEAD (the one already inside the unit) and the other one worked for charging, but after two minutes on the unit, also died, no more charging possible. I believe the unit is burning or shortcircuiting the batteries, so all are lost. A 20 kilos product (unit plus two batteries) and they all need return after TWO MINUTES of use. did not get wet inside, anything went wrong here.Maybe was my bad luck... let's he how the deal with similar problems on that ""heavy duty"" unit."
1,Battery worthless no customer service!,I purchased this scooter to replace the entry level units with the hope it would have more power and battery life. The unit worked for a week and the battery was shot. Would not take a charge and cannot be replaced. Sea Doo customer service is an oxymoron - there is none. Don't wast your money. Threw mine away.
3,"A FRIEND APPEARS IN THE MOVIE. i KNEW IT WOULDN'T BE VERY GOOD, BUT SHE SHOWED ALOT OF PROMISE.",pACKAGE ARRIVED PROMPTLY AND WAS WELL PROTECTED. WOULD DEAL WITH THIS VENDOR AGAIN. hAD BEEN LOOKING FOR MOVIE FOR SOMETIME.
5,I like it,"I'm severely disabled with limited mobility of my legs. I've been trying a lot of exercise programs while sitting down, but this is the first one designed for that. It's the only one I've ever had that actually moves your legs. This sucker made me sweat, but I felt so good for doing it. Someday I hope to be able to do the entire thing.It's a little cheesy, but most exercise videos are. But it's fun, and it works."
4,FUN!,"Because of bad ankles and because I am just plain awkward (Hey, honesty here...) I bought some of the chair exercise DVDs to have an additional way to get my heart rate up which doesn't use equipment. It's a change of pace for me from my usual exercises. Am I great at following his lead? Nope, but I hope that I will get better. Do I care? No. There is just something that feels so accepting and nonjudgmental about the man who leads the exercise and the music is so fun that I just laugh at myself when I flub up and just keep trying. Right now I get enough of it right enough, and get to laugh while doing so.In one word, this DVD is FUN!"
3,chair salsa,Too hard to chair dance - illustrate of the disc was good but it is difficult to carry this off - not interesting
5,Fantastic Dvd Workout,I used to do tae bo and turbojam until I injured my knee. Now I can't even jump up and down. I bought this video when I learned about chair exercises could help me. I was pleasantly surprised by this workout. First of all David Stamps is cute as a button and motivational. Also I have lost ten pounds since I started doing this one and watching what I eat in moderation. Not bad in two weeks time. I still have a lot to lose but I know with chair exercises and dieting I can reach my goal God willing. Great workout. G.Johnson
5,EXCELLENT!,"I work at a Senior Center, and our members LOVE LOVE LOVE this dvd! It's great for all fitness levels- from the most basic beginner to more seasoned exercisers. It's an upbeat, FUN workout & the instructor is very encouraging and pleasant. We actually had to add this one onto our weekly activity program because it was requested so much! I would HIGHLY recommend this DVD!!!"
4,so far so good,"I have just recieved this item, it look little bit big from picture, however it works well, so far I will see how long last,"
4,Good reference material,I am just getting into medical transcription and this is a very helpful resource. Would recommend for students as well.
5,Superior,"I found this product superior to other self study material; well organized and reasonably paced. Recommend using it on a PC so you can go over sentances/words repeatedly, but that applies to any CD material. Minor quibble, mans voice is a bit strong in English compared with the woman's voice in Cambodian, but all in all a product I would describe as superior."
4,A surprisingly thorough little audio language learning package,"The problem with most ""comprehensive"" foreign language audio programs is that they contain way too many tapes/CDs for the casual learner, and thus are out of such a learner's price range. This product, in contrast, seems to have distilled what you really need to know into an affordably modest program. It's keyed carefully to the book, and unlike most short programs, this one DOES have an introductory sound discrimination unit -- absolutely essential for mastering the sound system of a new language completely. Complete with some corny Cambodian court-style dance music at the beginning to set the mood, this is a program worth investing in for everyone -- from those looking to acquire nativelike Khmer all the way to the casual tourist just wanting to learn the basics."
4,Write in cambodian without misteries.,It teaches in a easy way to write in khmer language and enphatizes the colloquial knowledge of this exotic south-asiatic language.
1,Translation NOT Included!,The audio CDs that came with Cambodian For Beginners did not come with any printed material. Nor was there an English translation included on the CDs. Unless you are already fluent in Khmer you will need to purchase the book separately.The audio quality was so poor that one the CDs was completely not listenable.Without a doubt this was the worst purchase that I have ever made from amazon.com
4,Programming in C++,"Needed this book for my college class. As college books go this one was pretty good to understand. I did need a companion book when it started to get really heavy duty, but only because my instructor failed to fill in the gaps. I do think that for the price though the publishers could have included a CD-ROM with info and links for the student, this might have eliminated me having to buy a companion book. Over all as a beginner this book helped me grasp the fundamentals of C++. I have since gone on to use the book in other classes as a refresher."
4,Great book for beginner programmers,"This book is great for beginners who have never done any programming before. It goes into the basics of programming and focuses on good programming practices. I used it for my Computer Science class introduction to programming. This is not a book to learn C++ so much as it is to learn good programming practices based upon the C++ language. Everything you learn here can be applied to any other language. There are many better books for the C++ language, especially if you are interested in learning Object Oriented Programming."
2,computer science,"i hate this book, but thats probably b/c i hate the course that goes with it. this book does a better job explaining things than my professor does"
5,A fine instrument,"I debated whether or not to order this model. I already own two kinetic watches and I wasn't sure about the gold tones on the watch. But, after checking out other prices, this was way less than anywhere else so I thought I'd give the watch a try. I'm very glad I did. This is one of the nicest watches in my collection. The gold tones are very subtle and the watch looks classy and elegant. The face adds a little bit of sportiness which offets the business like look of the watch (just enough to make it different). It's not a sports watch but something you wear at the office, to dinner or to casually elegant outings (forget the sports bar dude). The one con? The watch band clasp does not offer fine adjustments. The only way to re-size the watch is to add or remove links."
1,"Terrible shredder, just awful","This shredder is just the worst. To get this shredder to handle 7 pieces of paper at once is impossible. Between the jams, clogs, overheating...this product just isn't worth it. The size and appearance are first rate but it's performance renders this product unusable. If you need to shred 1-2 peices of paper per week then this shredder is for you, otherwise avoid this at all costs!It's also extremely messy. Pulling a jammed piece of paper out throws shreded paper all over the floor.UPDATE: Royal sent me a replacement shredder...similar model but with totally different results. New design works as advertised. Original model still gets one star though and I had to pay for shipping ($13...or 25% of the cost of a new one)."
4,paper shredder,"i love the sleek look of the shredder, though it's not pure white as photo, it's off white/grey color. Performanceis very good, havent had any problem, dont over stuff or paper will jam otherwise, all is good. I would recommend for people who want a shredder with style and can do the job."
5,Eats paper,"This works as advertised. Eats up paper, credit cards, and CDs with no problem. It looks pretty nice, too; doesn't look utilitarian. If I could complain about anything, it is noisy while doing its job. No big deal for me, though. It works great."
1,crap,"At the end of the three months of ownership, this loser started to screaming like a banshee and took 10 minutes to shred a taxi cab receipt."
1,what a piece of crap,"I bought this at Bed, Bath and Beyond and within three weeks it completely stopped working. I never over did it or used too much paper. It constantly jammed with less than 7 pages. It's really loud and slow. Took it back and got another one thinking it was just that particular machine. When I got it home, it would not even work. It turned on but would not accept paper. DO NOT BUY THIS CRAPPY PRODUCT. Two out of two that I bought both broke within three weeks."
2,does not last very long....,"I bought this in january 2011, used it for a couple of months. By the end of the year it started falling apart and the cutter was broken (made of plastics)"
1,Terrible and looked used!,"I got this paper shredder hoping it would be a simple to use machine for everyday use. When I received it, even though I had bought it new, it looked like IT had gone through a paper shredder. The buttons were all worn off, it was loud and dingy. DO NOT BUY THIS!!"
2,Didn't Last,"I bought this for light duty. After a few months some of the plastic that is in between the metal shredding teeth broke out. This plastic serves to keep the shredded strips from wrapping around the shaft. After the plastic broke I would get paper wrapping around the shaft so bad it would slow down the motor and it eventually bent the shaft. I spent lot's of time cleaning the jams out so I could continue to use the machine, but finally I gave up and bought a better product for about the same money from Staples."
4,It does the job,"Well so far so good, it does the job in my apartment. Not a bad experience for such a cheap product."
4,Does the job perfectly well,"I really like this shredder. It is quite, small and really cheap. My only complaint is that I had selected another product and once I selected the vendor from the list the product was switched to this without me realizing it. So I was surprised when I opened the package and saw this in it. But, now that I have used it for a few weeks I am glad for the switch. This is a great shredder for light users. I usually have about 15-20 sheets a day to shred and of course lots of little pieces like month old receipts."
2,Breaks fast,"Nice looking little product for the home office, but the motor breaks after only a few months of light use."
1,don't waste your money,"The most this thing can handle is 2 sheets of paper... the motor on mine is dying and I haven't even had this for a week. It choked on 6 sheets of paper, and ever since the motor has been going nuts.I think the problem is a fundamental design problem with the shredder after looking at the bottom of it... the paper can jam on the side of the plastic creating unnecessary friction, thereby ruining the motor.Although this could be true of most shredders as well too. You get what you pay for.. Stay away from this one."
1,item arrived used - twice,"shredder looks great, but arrived clearly used with scratches all over. I sent it back and received another used model...with bits of paper still stuck inside. plugged it in and it wasn't even in working condition. maybe third time is a charm, but i'm not going to find out. very disappointed."
2,"Looks nice, Shreds poorly","I purchased this shredder a little over a year ago, and it is already broken. The sensor no longer works, so when I turn on the machine the shred blades start running without any paper in the slot. The rumors are true too about it not handling more than two or three pieces of paper. It is also really REALLY loud. It is so loud that I have to shut the door to my office, so as not to disturb the whole house. I have used shred oil extensively, so I've never neglected the blades. I will keep it because it does the job. It just doesn't do the job that great. Then again, in my experience, what shredder actually works great through the years?! I've yet to find one, and this one is certainly NO exception. Unfortunately, this product is not recommended. :-("
3,Just Desserts,Poor Martha! Some Miss Grundy of a school teacher must have sent Martha to the corner for coloring out of the lines and she (Martha) never recovered. This is a fast read and lots of laughs.
4,Good coffee klatsch material,"I have to admit, I do tune in to Martha's show every once in a while and enjoy what I see on the screen. Oppenheimer does do a good job in letting us see what goes on off-screen. Great and famous people often stand upon the shoulders of giants, and Ms. Stewart is no different in that regard (according to Oppenheimer, she was also more than happy to stand on the shoulders of her family and several members of her staff, too).The author really does seem to admire Stewart's drive and tenacity, while showing us the rather sordid underside of how she acquired her fame and who she hurt to get it. Well, corporate abuse is nothing new; and Oppenheimer is simply telling the story of one woman's quest for fame and fortune--and succeeded in getting them."
3,Misses much of the point,"Though this is a well put together work, it really is for people who feel inferior to Martha. As someone who first loved her stuff and then stepped back and had to laugh at the complexity of some of those ""projects"" of hers, my overall impression on her personal problems is, So what? Most celebrities & powerful businessmen are megalomaniacs with family dramas. People who hate her probably feel inadequate to what she represents, but Martha must feel extraordinarily inadequate to have built such an empire trying to prove herself! Much of the boom in cooking shows and quality products now available to most of America is thanks to that woman. Better produce, better cooking utensils, nicer stuff at Pottery Barn, etc. Her problems & feelings of inadequacy about herself have caused her to influence this country, enabling all of us to have nicer-looking public spaces and better food when we eat out. And, she has problems. Whoop de doo."
2,Blah,"This book seems to only care about the ""bad"" points of Martha Stewart, and doesn't even mention any of her good qualities, which is just horrible to do to anyone! This author seems to only care about the negative qualities of a person (being Martha) and makes it seem like she's the most horrible person in the world. I like her show, she has some great ideas, like turning a oatmeal container into a decorative drum. I find her ideas helpful, especially around the holidays. Don't waste your money on this book, it's nothing but pure garbage, and very one-sided!"
2,It will change your view of Stuart.,"As you see, Stuart didn't write the book. This book is about the horrible things that Stuart did in life. It didn't mention one good thing she did in her lifetime. It makes Stuart look so mean and ugly. Because of what this author did, I now think that Staurt is a evil person. If you like Stuart and want to read this book, I strongly recommend the you don't. You will think she is an evil person after reading the book."
5,The Best Overall Guidebook to the Southwest,"I travel in the Southwest frequently and have a diverse collection of guidebooks to the region. Rough Guide is my favorite, with the intelligently written descriptions and opinions. The other guidebooks are drier or shallower in comparison (Moon, Lonely Planet, Let's Go, DK, and Frommer's)."
1,Not For Sheltie,"I have a one year oldl sheltie who barks at anything that moves. We have had complaints from the neighbors during the day time when my wife and I were at work. We bought this collar on the advice of our local pet store. I have to say that it is not worth a dime, especially since it is non refundable. It works as advertised in that it emits a loud beep when theh dog barks. However, this does absolutely nothing to deter a sheltie a sheltie from barking further. I can't imagine it working at all on a larger dog."
2,"Works, but lots of false-alarms","It does seem to be effective, but there are lots of ""false alarms"", false activations. My dog may be just laying on the bed and it'll go off, for no apparent reason, frightening and confusing him and making the training less effective. If he shakes, it'll go off. If I take him in the car and have a window open, it'll go off. And all this is on the less-sensitive setting! The battery also only works for about a month, which likely is all you'll need anyway. The battery is also NOT something you can just pick up at any drugstore, It's their proprietary product.Probably about what you can expect for the price."
1,Don't waste your money on this,"Seems like my feedback isn't really going to add anything here because it's the same as everyone else's.This collar beeps when my dogs do everything except bark. When they shake, play, bump into something, scratch themselves, etc. I have only heard it beep once when they were actually barking, and it was after they had already barked 3 or 4 times.I know after having them for only a few hours that they are useless. It has to be perfectly consistent and only beep when the dogs bark in order for it to reinforce the training. Good thing I kept all of the packaging in order because they are going back!!"
2,Too sensitive to noise,"I like the idea of this product. It however is too sensetive to the dog moving and shaking his head. It works well only if it corrects when he is barking, but it fails in that regard. You should use it only with a collar that makes absolutely no noise or it's purpose is defeated.I would not recommend base on my use."
2,I can't stop my screaming chihuahua!,I bought this with the hope it would stop my chihuahua from screaming and barking when I left the house. I was pretty disappointed. She didn't respond to the beeping. I found screaming back at her worked much better.
1,So-so,"Kind of works... dog hears noise, looks confused, and then barks again. Maybe stops after a while. I thought it would be high-pitched noise that only dogs could hear. Actually very loud, annoying BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP.Confusing packaging and advertising conflict re: appropriateness for small dogs. My dog is 7lbs. Is this okay? Amazon.com says 8lbs but PetSafe's website does not list size requirements. Also concerned in general for dog's ears. Might it hurt them in long run?In the Operations Manual it says the battery life of the product should be approximately one month, depending on how much the dog barks. My dog does not bark very much but the battery only lasted about six nights of wear. (He barked about 3x per night.) The replacement batteries are made by PetSafe and they cost about $10 for a two-pack. I hope it solves my dog's barking problem soon or this is going to get expensive.Meant to rank 3 stars. Oooops. Better than shock collars but would prefer a better method."
1,Do not waste your time or money,"This collar is advertised specifically for use with ""small dogs"". I have a pomeranian who likes to bark a little too often so this seemed like a logical solution.Now, I'm not sure what sort of ""SMALL"" dogs Petsafe has available at it's research and testing site, but the collar included in the package was just over 29 inches long and 1"" wide. It's probably perfect for your average Saint Bernard.I considered cutting the collar down to fit, but decided to test it first. Good thing I did! After putting it on my little pup and coaxing him to bark I noticed there was no sound at all. I tried several times but the only time it ever beeped was when he bumped the unit with his foot while scratching at his neck. It never EVER beeped after a bark. Not even once!I too am taking this thing back to where I bought it. Buyers beware. This product is only useful as a very ugly $50 paperweight."
1,"Very disappointed, can't believe it passed quality inspection","I bought this collar Petsafe PUSB-300 new from the store... I don't know how it even passed quality inspection. I was very hesitant to try it out at first due to the one review posted by a user due to its battery problem. I had really no choice but to try this out, since I wanted to stay away from electric shock collars or the citronella spray (too expensive). I bought the colllar for around $50. The collar worked fine for a few hours, then the battery died. I don't see any weather factors that can make the collar malfunction, such as rain, the day I used it on my chihuahua was very sunny and clear. Now I believe the online posters. Please be careful in buying this collar. You may just become disappointed like me and end up buying tons of batteries for it ($10)."
1,It might work for some dogs,The collar sounded off loud and clear whenever our dog shook her head. It didn't sound off when she barked. No changes to the sensitivity made any difference. Pretty much a useless product unless you want your dog to stop shaking its head.
1,So Disappointed,I bought 2 of these No bark collars for my 2 Schnauzers. One 5 years old the other 7 months. I could hear the high pitch as my dogs barked and barked and barked at the door and out side. This product also made the high pitch noice when they walked around.
1,not worth it,"Bought one of these collars, and within 2 weeks, it stopped functioning. so we figured it was the battery, went and bought the replacement batteries, and it STILL does not work. Called up the company, and basically was told that there was a $40 fee to get it repaired. $40?!?!?!?! HALF THE COST OF THE PRODUCT. DO NOT BUY THIS. I am currently looking into ANY other company that does NOT sell products that don't work after 2 weeks and expect the customer to pay nearly half the original cost of the product to get it fixed. If any one has any suggestions, please let me know."
1,Take my advice:save the headache and don't buy this,"Bought this about 2 weeks ago, not from amazon. It works at all the wrong times. It has never once corrected my dog for barking. It has corrected my neighbors dogs, and made a correction when my dog scratched herself. The thing makes an audible beep, which is more annoying to humans than dogs. Their ears perk up and they carry about their business. The collar is way too long for my dog and her existing collar would be too thick to add the device to. The worst part for me is that Petco's return policy does not allow you to return opened items. Unfortunately the boxing, likely to prevent theft (save your time thieves this is not worth it) makes it impossible to open the box and try the device without ripping the outer box and the plastic. Now I will be extremely unlikely to charm my way into getting a refund for my $60. So my advice, don't buy this at all, but if you succumb to temptation, check the return policy first."
1,what a joke.,"My neighbor's dog has one of these. When he barks, we can hear the HF sound two lots away, but the dog keeps barking."
2,minimally effective,"THis product produces an anoying loud buzz. It did not control my dogs barking. I did better putting them on a sit-stay for a a minute, rather then use this product to reduce barking. Remember if you buy this product you must be in the room to reinforce behavior to get your dog to quit barking, if not your dog will get used to the noise and you will having a barking dog that also makes a loud buzzing noise"
3,Petsafe PUSB-300 Sonic Bark Collar,"Product performed well when we first used it on our mini schnauzer, who is a real barker. However it would trigger itself at times, especially when in a car. We had to remove it from our dog while driving in our van and it continued to go off until we finally removed the battery.Must be an electrical frequency issue, but when it works correctly it is good."
1,Didn't work at all!,Returned before the 30 day deadline..... ended up purchasing the Bark Collar that sprays a small amount of Citronella - and that works great! The small sound that this item makes did not work for my small ShihTzu at all.
2,Worked for a short time. Not long term.,I bought this and it worked for the first year but then she started to learn that she can ignore the collar. I hate the problem with having to change the batteries out every second week and how expensive it is to get batteries for this unit. I even did what other people said to do by taking the battery out when my dog was not wearing the collar but I was still going through them like crazy. I do not recomend this for dogs that like to bark.
2,works sometimes for no reason,"The collar works sometimes when the dog barks and sometimes for no reason at all or simply because the dog is scratching. Not an effective product. After 10 days of usage the clip got stuck and we were unable to take the collar off without taking the whole collar apart. You can only put it on another collar if it comes completely apart from the clip, something not mentioned in the product description."
1,a piece of crap.,"It would go off even when our dog was just laying down doing nothing. Then when he did bark it would only work some times. And because it only worked part of the time and when he was not barking at all it made This collar worthless, and not even worth a $1.00."
2,Works but not always for barking and is incredibly annoying,"The collar does actually stop my dog's barking after about 2 barks BUT it also will go off frequently when she is not barking (I even taped up her tags so they wouldn't jingle as per packaging instructions). It's loud and incredibly annoying to humans too and in the car it's even worse, frequently going off over every bump or something seemingly randomly. In the 5 minutes stretch from my apartment to work it goes off 8-10 times AND possibly the worst part is that it has no off button!! You have to use a coin to unscrew the battery and physically take it out if you want it to stop. Also annoying is that is comes with an ugly bright orange nylon collar and it's extremely difficult to find a regular collar that will fit the attachment on it. If it wasn't as loud to humans, as sensitive to EVERYTHING, and, if at the very least it had an off switch I'd actually give it 4 stars but as it is, it's barely worth it for the hassle."
1,PetSAfe UltraLight Sonic Bark Collar,"This product does not work on my 20lb dog. She barks and the sound emits. while my dog isin the patio walking, the sound emits with little response from my dog. It does not work...period.I was wanting to return this product and try an electroni impulse on neck. Let me know what I needto do. Thanks"
4,Argo Large Dog Carrier,"This product fit perfectly on the airplane- It was the first time my dog, about 11.5 lbs. flew with me and to my surprise, he was calm and so quiet that no one new a dog was inside until I took him out on the plane. I think the privacy mesh helped- he could see out, but no one could see in. The color of the bag is true to what you see online. The only thing I wish it had was more padding on the shoulder strap and maybe handles on the sides that you could use to carry your pet with one hand when you don't use the strap. The large was just the right size for my dog- gave him a little room to turn around. I think the small wouldn't have work- he is a Bichon Mix..."
4,A little to small,"I bought and ended up returning this purchase. It is a very nice high quality, good looking bag. However I have a 6lb maltese yorkie mix and was flying across the coast, so about 8 hours of flying. After putting him in, letting him move, etc it was just to small. The air line requirements say he has to be able to stand up and if you place the bag side ways he could stand, but flat on the ground he wasn't even close to standing. I ended up buying another cheaper quality bag at a local pet store that worked out fine. It had barely any lining, except for the bottom, therefore more space inside the bag for my dog. Amazon was excellent on the return."
5,very happy,"We needed to move our animals cross country and after searching to find a carrier to fit under Southwest's airplane seats, we decided upon this one. It was wonderful! While it was a bit more expensive than the others we considered, the carrier was sturdy and we will be able to use it many more times. It is solidly constructed and gave our cat a real sense of security. And most importantly, it fit perfectly under the seats. We are very happy with this purchase!"
2,"it's sturdy, but over priced for sure.","I was traveling with my dog for the first time and needed a carrier. I fell in love with the design of the Aero-Pet through the pictures. The images uploaded by users also persuaded me to purchase this on top of the good reviews. It is very cute, but not practical.My main complaint is that there is DEFINITELY not enough ventilation in this carrier. The back is totally sealed off, and there should be mesh or something on the top. WAY TOO HOT TO TRAVEL WITH IN SUMMER!!! DON'T DO IT!! I live in Florida and my poor dog was about to overheat in this thing. I honestly wish I could return this but I have used it :(Also, there is no way to keep a towel or blanket secured to the bottom of the carrier; it just slides around on the little pad. The bottom is very sturdy, and didn't collapse while using the shoulder strap.I honestly feel like this carrier is unsafe for pets."
4,Perfect for ferrets,"Was able to keep two ferrets in the cage during a international flight. At times I would open up the top to allow some additional venting in while they were sleeping, I felt that they were more comfortable in this than a plastic or wire cage. Both ferrets were under three pounds, if they were larger it would not have worked out so well. It was really easy to clean as well."
5,Excellent,I purchased this for a direct flight from phoenix to columbus. If your dog is 7+ lbs go with the large bag. I was nervous at first about him fitting he is a Maltipoo 8 pound dog. He had plenty of room once he was lying down. The bad is comfortable to carry and stylish. It looks so much like luggage no one knew I had a pet and the airline check in never asked for his ticket
5,Worth the money!,"I bought this carrier a couple months ago because I need to move from West to East coast and both me and cat loves it. First of all, it's airline approved. Second, it fits perfectly under the seat. Third, it's really easy for me to carry, it's just like a travel bag and it has little pockets on the side for me to put treats and catnip. Fourth, it's small enough but surprisingly roomy for my cat to feel secure, safe and comfortable while she's on the plane and she's able to see through the meshes to know that I'm right next to her. She was calm and quiet throughout the trip. Last but not least, Orange looks soo cool!! Everyone, including my vet, thought it was the coolest pet carrier ever. I totally recommend to anyone who needs an upgrade or a pet carrier for local or travel on plane."
3,Not the ideal dog carrier,"Bag seems to run small, I ordered a size Small based on the dimensions that are required by the airline service and of my dog (which is only 10 pounds) and he could not fit inside this bag. The construction is great but it does not seem to be a comfortable bag for a dog, especially for the price they are asking. I returned it and bought a Sherpa bag."
5,Argo Pet Carrier,Well made. Good side compartment for storing leash and snacks. Great Color. I found a super deal on Amazon.
3,The large is aweful small.,"It is a very sturdy and good looking bag. One way mesh is nice for cats, but I am not sure how the ventilation will be. I am extreamly disappointed in this item. I ordered and paid a great deal of money for a ""NEW"" carrier. As soon as I got it open, cat/dog treats fell out, there was animal hair all over the inside. I needed this bag to transport a cat, not a kitten over seas and was mortified about how small it was. Now, I am stuck with it, and still have 3 weeks to find one that fits for my adult cat."
3,Wrong DVD,"I actually ordered this product by mistake but that is on me. I want to make sure that those who are looking for the secret regarding the law of attraction, please do not buy this by mistake as I did. Although it is a fairly decent story, it is not what you are looking for in the secret so purchase what you are looking for first and perhaps if you have extra money and time to spend then you can buy this one also, further down on your list.This movie is about a life secret that people had been carrying for years. It finally caught up with them. It is a decent story, but definitely not ""The Secret"" you are expecting for spiritual growth, enlightenment, and/or financial success.GEMAltadena"
2,The Secret,I got this cd by mistake as I wanted the other The Secret DVD. This is a strange and unusual movie.
2,not nearly as compelling as i thought it would be,"and the secret is alluded to,even telegraphed a bit too early on for mytaste.that sort takes away from one avenue of suspense.the rest of thestory is fairly predictable,though it has a few minor surprises.i foundit actually quite depressing.i even felt it had a bit of an oppressivefeel to it.the synopsis on the back of the DVD cover makes it seem muchmore compelling and dramatic than it actually is.i mostly thought itwas boring.maybe you have to be in a certain mood or frame of mind toappreciate it.if so,i clearly wasn't in the right mood or frame ofmind.i just know i was glad when it was over.i don't see myselfwatching this movie again.for me,The Secret would have been best leftuntold. 2/5"
3,A Twisted Saga,"Emma Faraday is a wife and mother with two healthy children and a satisfying career, all seems fine and they are happy. Then one day her old friend, Nadia, re-enters her life, with only one goal in mind, revenge.Emma has been keeping a secret from her childhood. This information about her self is so shameful to her that she has even kept hidden for years from everyone, including her husband. This situation sets her up to be taken advantage of by her old friend. Not wanting the secret out, Emma relinquishes almost total control to Nadia who systematically destroys her life.Choices have to be made. Does Emma let her life and happiness be taken away or does she fight to keep her family together. The suspense that the lead character feels does come through the screen. This saga is a made for BBC TV production."
2,No Secrets Here,"If you understand the concept of manifesting, you're not going to find anything new here. It's an inexpensively produced DVD of sound and sight bites, all encouraging the audience to think positive. It's a nice pep talk, but not worth the thirty dollars I paid for it at a local bookstore."
3,I-Zone and ME - squelching the myth,"Contrary to the previous post about this camera and the software incompatibility with Windows ME, I had no problems installing, running, or downloading pictures to my ME based PC.The concept of the camera is awesome but the quality seems to be so-so. You have to be really careful of the lighting or the pictures come out too bright or too dark. We also had to make sure that the subject was far enough away (3-4 feet as someone else pointed out) and that there was no movement when the picture was snapped or it would turn out blurry.I like the camera and will probably use it for fun shots but will make sure to have a regular camera around for really important photos."
1,I-Zone...a don't buy zone,"Merry Christmas! This is my first digital camera given as a gift. I would not recommend this as gift to anyone. I can't tell whether the camera is upside down-right side up. Polaroid really was not thinking of the average customer when they designed this product. Sometimes more options can be a big headache.Do your life a favor, buy a real digital camera.Polaroid was this a Monday or Friday designed product? Just curious?"
3,"Can't get software CD to open, Customer Sevice didn't call","I can't open the software, nor can you download it anwhere. I would like to take the pictures that I took off the camera, however, the CD won't open right.If anyone knows why, please let me know!"
2,i-zone is OK--the digital function is [bad] in the extreme,"I bought this for my high school daughter to use as a ""fun"" camera for the most part--she & her friends love this i-zone concept. My thought was this would also provide the digital capabilities she needs for some of her group school projects in a package inexpensive enough that if it were damaged or stolen it wouldn't be that bi a deal.The i-zone functions work as well as those of stand alone i-zone cameras her friends have. The problem is that the digital functions are so [bad] that they are essentially useless.The problems: The camera is just about impossible to focus. The viewfinder is apparently off kilter and you never seem to get the right segment subject matter you wanted to photograph. The resolution is horrible--even relatively small prints are out of focus and distorted..."
2,Not if you are serious about taking pictures........,"Okay. I admit to not expecting a great deal from this camera, but I was really hoping for the best. It's difficult to use the digital part, but the instant pictures were fun! I finally gave it to the kids to play with. They love to practice, but have yet to take a good digital picture. Much more of a toy than useful camera."
3,"Camera is good and excellent for the money - but, don't drop",I loved the camera and I love it more now that I've purchased a Mustek which is going back. Just be careful - don't drop it! The batteries burn out very quickly and it would be great if it came with some kind of adapter.
1,"terrible quality, even for the price","i wouldn't recommend this one, not even for the price... the sticky film feature is kind of fun, but the digital camera is not good at all. it's virtually impossible to take pictures inside- they either come out way too dark so that you can't even decipher what it's supposed to be, or WAY too bright and over exposed, bleaches out every thing. the software that it comes with is not bad though, and the whole thing is self explanatory and very simple to use."
1,Stupidity from Polaroid,"It's a fun camera if you don't mind expensive mini prints. The sticky film can be fun. It's a fun digital camera too, except Polaroid is too stupid to put even basic software on the web.Don't lose the CD. If you thought you'd take the camera and your laptop on a fun trip (because the camera only holds small photos) don't lose the CD!! You won't be able to view pictures ever again if you lose the CD.And without USB? What were they thinking? Getting pictures out of this thing is like watching paint dry."
2,"Cute, but more of a plaything than a real camera","This camera is cute. Period. It's great for kids who are learning to shoot photos, but the film is kinda pricey when you consider that kids don't really shoot well and might run through LOTS of film. Nevertheless, it might be a good learning tool for them since they can instantly see the photo they took.If you are an adult, you will be disappointed with this though. If you want a real Polaroid, look at the Polaroid Spectra.Otherwise, the camera and kit are great. COmes with film, focus-free camera lens (bult in), flash, etc."
4,For $30 this is a great digital camera!,"This is our first digital camera and, so far, I am pretty impressed. I expected much less due to the low price of $30 after rebate! It was VERY easy to install the software and get the camera plugged in to my computer. Unlike other people who have reviewed this camera, there aren't any problems with the Polaroid software working with my HP scanner software. Photos download very quickly, no time spent waiting around. Thumbs up!"
2,Beware rebate rip-off,"I bought this camera for my five year old daughter so that she could take pictures and I would not go broke on film development costs. The after-rebate cost ... seemed acceptable. However, three months after I purchased the camera, I still do not have the.. rebate check and my recent phone calls went unreturned. The check was supposed to be sent within six weeks. The rebate is imperative to this purchase because the camera is not functional for much more than use by little children and is not worth the pre-rebate price."
1,wrong cable,We bought this camera to use as a digital. Installed the software and batteries- went to hook up the cable to the computer - the laptop only has a USB port - the desktop the corresponding port is the one for the mouse - so there was no way to use it - I certainly was not going to purchase an expensive USB connection for a [amt.] camera.Also the film that came with it had an expiration date of 11/99. The company offered more film but no solution on the cable so we returned it.Very disappointing. I guess it is the old story of you get what you pay for.
5,Excellent entry level digital - typical Polariod quality,"This is my first digital camera & love it! The i-zone instant portion compares favorably to other Polaroid products I've used in the past. The digital portion is easy to use and easy to connect to my PC (Compaq running Windows 98). I've experienced no problems using the camera except how to hold it - putting two cameras together at a 90 degree angle poses some ergonomic questions as to the proper way to hold the camera in use. As far as resolution goes, I'm happy with it - don't expect 35 mm quality - rather it's a fun toy to send snaphots through the net and to play with digitally using the supplied software."
1,Save your money,"I thought this would be a good, inexpensive way to explore the world of digital cameras for my son. Unfortunately the the first one was defective (the flash only worked sporadically). It was quickly and easily replaced. Then there were problems with getting the ""right"" type of batteries - which didn't last very long. When it was working it was fun but I thought I would have been much better off saving my money and buying a ""real"" digital camera."
5,off da hook,"This album is off da hook, a must any hip hop fan.i loved it from start to finish.what i liked bout it was the fact that alot of the songs i have always wanted to get, but didnt want to get the artists albums, so this album came in very handy. u gotta get it"
1,Amazon knowledge,"If you want to know about the ecosystem, animals, and every stop or hamlet you will pass going down the Amazon this story is for you."
4,Standing on Solid Ground,I found this book to be very helpful. It's so easy to over-manage our children and in the long-term not help them mature. This book gave solid examples and helps parents to stay grounded. I recommend it frequently.
5,Second Copy,"We purchased this book out of desperation. We have a 27 and 33 year old still living with us. This book has done more to help us than any other resource we've used. We held our first family meeting last week and the results changed the mood in our house from angry and sullen to open communication and sharing. Parenting Your Adult Child will help you understand this generation and how they tend to think. The book lays out simple plans for building confidence to help your adult children navigate the world on their own. My husband was so intrigued by all I told him he had me order a second copy. We're still not an empty nest yet, but at least for the first time in a very long time we're making progress."
4,sent to my mom for my 21 year old sister,hope it is helpful. love gary chapman i have read many of his books and have enjoyed them all. wish i could afford to buy it for many more
2,Parenting Your Adult Child,"This book was useful for focusing on issues in the relationships that parents have to their adult children. The principles taught were elementary, and the perspective was entirely from the parent's side, with not nearly enough empathy for the point of view of adult children. The title of the book, not to mention many of the underlying assumptions, is very offensive to ""adult children""! My adult children suggested changing the title to ""How to avoid parenting your adult children..."""
1,Don't bother! No thanks to the Religious Dogma.,"As the Mother of a Twenty something I searched for a book that would help me with parenting. I noticed the references to the Bible in the first chapter and it got worse after that. I take offence to material that says, in essence, homosexuality can be fixed, and to love your children but encurage them not to 'sin'. NO Thanks"
3,A machine or fairy?,"I have not read many graphic novels, but I did enjoy this one. It was a good story line, and you really gain a sense of the character's personalities. I just wish more happened in the book, but I guess there is a sequel that may fill in some of the blanks I was left with."
1,Disappointed,2 of the 3 Swiss Rolls arrived moldy - I contacted the Company via email but have never received a response. Although I truly enjoy other products ordered from this Company it is very bad customer service to not contact a Client after a complaint and try to make it right - slowed down my ordering from them as a result
4,patches,"The order was received promptly. The items were of excellent quality ,and what I had ordered."
1,Stay away,"Worst basket ever. Comes in cheap box with bad food inside. Total rip off for over $50. No basket, box is broken, food included is small and not exciting."
1,The picture doesn't match the item,"You have to read the description quite carefully. There is no basket in this ""Art of Appreciation Gift Basket"" - it's just a cardboard box. For this price, you would expect a basket. This is all wrong..."
1,Not worth the money,"The nicest thing about this package is the basket, and that's not even that nice. I bought this for my husband for Valentine's Day, and he was not a fan (and he's pretty easy to please). The food items are small, cheap looking and bad tasting."
1,Worst Gift Ever,I ordered this for my husband for Valentine's Day. I was completely mortified at the size of this gift basket and not to mention that the food was awful. Many items were crushed inside the packages and were not even where you could eat them. I was very embarrassed and would NEVER order anything from them again!
4,A little fussy but over all decent..,"I've got this set up for office use which has been working according to plan- though, i agree that the remote is not very good and it gets no use. The CD player sometimes gives me trouble but over all it's a decent working system for my needs."
3,amp part great cd/dvd leaves a little to be desired,"The amp is fantastic. It is being used in a hall with ceiling speakers and mike jacks in the wall. Great sound quality. The cd/dvd player skips and it is hard to change tracks, with or without the remote that doesn't even look like it belongs to the amp/player."
1,Got A Defective One,"As a Prime Member, I was happy to take advantage of Amazon's free 2-day delivery on select items. I received the package on time just as promised and my enthusiasm soon declined once I unboxed the unit and began to test it. The first thing I noticed once I had everything set up and turned on for testing was the annoying whinning humming or noise in the background that would not go away no matter how I rearranged and/or replaced cables, speakers or input devices. It seems that this is a true paging PA system, since it includes a siren button which works and quite loudly. However, I have no use for this function. I decided to return the unit back. The main reason I ordered it was to utilize the PA Amplifier portion of the unit. This one definitely was defective."
4,1st Defective - 2nd Perfect,"Received the product, un-boxed it and plugged it in. PA side is fine. Turned on the DVD/CD Player and the tray constantly opens and closes. To get a warranty, you have to pay to send it in with another check for $20 for them to send it back. Warranty isn't worth the paper it's written on.****EDIT****Thanks to Amazons policy, I recieved a new system. Hooked it up, and it worked perfectly. Lesson learned here, order from Amazon directly, and you will be satisfied."
1,Poor quality,I purchased this item for DVD purpose but neither the DVD or the remote control works please send me another one or return ups stickers to return it back to the company where it came from because I am not happy w/this product.
1,"I wanted this, but realized it was a fake DVD rip that would only play on my computer","I wanted this, but realized it was a fake DVD rip that would only play on my computerI don't know what to say, I bet travel channel does not sell just one episode like this for $10.00, I should have realized that, usually it's season by season."
2,Green,"Great band. Wanted to hear way more dish about the NY music scene, not Larry's musings on 9/11 and such."
2,Couldn't be more cliche...,"I picked up Age of Mastery after reading some good things about Jag Panzer, and listening to few song samples. I would rate this CD as a definite disappointment.While the singer, and guitar player are solid, the music is boring and rehashed, and the lyrics are completely cliche.These guys are a perfect example of everything that was wrong with metal in the 80s."
3,Middle of the Road,The book is a classic and contains the methodology of conducting phenomenological research. It is plainly written and fairly easy to understand.
5,Must Have...,Well if you are looking at this book you know this author is one of the best. If you are doing a dissertation on this type of research this is a MUST have.
2,Not very down-to-earth,"A rather Rhetoric playing work, lack of clarity...there are better books in Phenomenology than this one..."
2,A waste of money.,"I just bought one of these cards for my parents so I could upgrade their computer. I knew ATI cards where the primary video decive that the Windows Operating Systems were made on so I figured they would be the most compatible. HAH! I guesed wrong! After installing everything on the ""easy installation CD"" I restarted and then saw that the drivers haden't even been installed! I looked for the drivers on the CD. None. They reccomended on their website that you dont use the CD and download drivers from their achive. After being lost in the achive I finnaly found the drivers. Installed them and it worked. I tryed Quake III Arena on their 600mhz PIII and it was slower than HECK! I tore it out and returned it immediatly! My parents now have an outstanding TnT 2 Ultra made by the great nVidia. DO Not buy this card."
4,Import not worth the extra money,"When I first ordered this item the only reason I ordered it was for the Bonus DVD and the bonus track Chillin' that was mentioned in the original description. Finally the CD/DVD arrived, I opened it popped in the DVD and started watching it. The DVD is edited all of the curse words are bleeped out, I continued to watch it anyway and once I finished it I popped in the CD to listen to the bonus track. Once again I was short changed, there was no bonus song. The Import bonus version is not worth the extra money spent, for the edited DVD that comes with the regular version of the CD.I think that if a CD or any other product's description changes the buyer should be notified before the album is shipped and the buyer is charged."
1,Middle of the Road...,"I think this is a book that most people who are thinking about planting a Church should read. But keep in mind that it is a 50/50 prospect for ideas. For example, The do a great job of explaining how following the great commission is THE prime mover when thinking about planting a Church. Everything that you do should be filtered through the belief that if what you are doing is not for the purpose of introducing people to Jesus, and making desciples who obey him...then don't do it. However, they both take a very narrrow view of the pastoral ministry that I think gives too much power to the senior pastor of a Church and sets them up as more than just the engineer of vision, but as an all powerful dictator."
4,Essential for churches looking to achieve growth,"As a leader in my church, I found this book to be a great tool for providing insight and direction into ways to grow your ministry. It is easy to read (I finished it in 3 days) and can be used as the focal point for a series of discussions amongst the chuch leadership."
3,Good ideas,I appreciated the mindset put forth about thinking in growth terms and constantly looking to the next step. Not sure about the closed group type of leadership. It seems to place nimbleness ahead of transparency.
3,Worth Checking Out,"A decent church leadership/church growth book. Some things raised my eyebrows in a, ""Huh, I should try that,"" kinda way. Others raised my eyebrows in a, ""Hmm, not sure about that,"" kinda way.Lotta people poo-poo on anything church growth related, but those people typically aren't pastors (in my limited experience). Like every other book, church growth books should be read critically. This book is worth checking out, particularly by church leaders."
5,Camcorder for the Prosumer,"I bought this camcorder last December (2004) and it is absolutely the best picture I have seen out of a Mini DV camcorder. I originally bought the Panasonic 3CCD and returned it due to no ability to adjust shutter speed below 60 for low light conditions. This goes down to 4 fps which you better have it on a tripod or serious ghosting will appear. The perfect setting I have found for low light, for instance inside your home is 30 frames per second. This camera will also take MPEG4 movies to the memory stick for emailing. Overall, I must say this is the best camera on the market currently for the price. Buy one and you will not be sorry!!! Have fun shooting!"
4,Love this camcorder but...,"This is the greatest little camcorder in the world with lots of bells and whistles that would have been way more expensive a while ago. I do wish that it had actual fstops rather than a slider on the touch screen for more accurate adjustments, ditto shutter speed and the manual focus is a bit fussy. More easily accessible manual controls would make it close to perfect. the touch screen takes a little getting used to and is not the very best idea. Other than that image quality is terrific under all sorts of different conditions, a camera mounted mike has decent sound and it is really a pleasure to use."
5,Completely addictive...,"Clever, cool and unique, categorising this quite brilliant album is almost unfair but if you're into creative downbeat electronica/dance or electro/jazz you've just stumbled on a hidden gem. Layering swathes of tight, controlled electro-riffs, instrumental flourishes & vocals on top of insidious club back-beats it pulls off the quite amazing trick of being incredibly complex, seriously funky and totally laid-back all at the same time... and, as a result, it'll grab you're attention from the very first play and then just keep pulling you back for more. File under ""completely addictive""."
5,This toy isn't so bad!,I bought this toy for my son at 7 months of age and he is now 1 years old and still is having fun with it. I admit that it is noisy and at times you don't want to hear all the sounds that it is making but that's why it was made to stimulate children. I have not had any experiences with it going off by itself unless it was not properly placed on the stand. So maybe those that go off so frequently and in the middle of the night were just faulty or not put up correctly. But all in all it's a great toy and a very good time consumer for your little ones. They get a kick out of it just spinning around and around and as your child gets older they learn how to work the different parts that make certain sounds.
2,Bad Idea,"I thought this was going to be a really good toy for my son. I was WRONG! The music is loud and obnoxious, there's no volume control, no on/off switch, it is constantly going off by itself, and it comes off the base too easily. At first it really scared my son; now he isn't afraid of it, he just never plays with it. It definitely doesn't hold his interest. I expected a lot more out of Fisher-Price, but was disappointed. Don't waste your money!"
1,Wish we hadn't bought it!,"This toy is a waste. The music is extremely annoying. Of course the music on most infant toys is repetitive, but this is BAD!!! Also, I agree with everybody saying it comes off too easily and the base is dangerous. My son swings it around and I'm afraid he's going to bonk himself with it. He actually plays with the base more than he does the toy."
4,"neat toy, with caution","This is a neat toy, but comes right off the base. Everytime I replace it my daughter pulls in right off. That being said, she enjoys playing with the atom part separately, but I wish it was designed to stay on the base and spin."
2,ITS OKAY BUT NOT FOR A STRONG BABY,"WELL MY BABY GIRL IS 7 MONTHS AND I THOUGHT THAT SHE WOULD LIKE THE TOY, BUT THE FIRST THING SHE DID WAS PICK IT OUT OF THE HOLDER AND START SWINGING IT. SHE ALMOST HIT HER HEAD, THE BOTTONS ARE A LITTLE TO HARD FOR HER TO PLAY WITH SO SHE REALLY DOESN'T LIKE IT AT ALL."
1,Can we get our money back!??,"I let my son look thru the toy store and ""pick"" this out. He's only 6 1/2 months, but we thought he would enjoy it. He enjoyed spinning the atom until the atom came off the base. Then he sat there looking at us like ok Mom what's the matter w/ this thing. Then after losing interest in the atom, he played w/ the base. He pulled on one end and the base came up and hit him in the head. This has happened at least 3 more times. We have since put the toy away. The toy is fine w/ adult supervision, but to be honest, I don't want to be around as this toy plays this tune over and over and over, w/ no off switch. We are very dissatisfied and would like our money back. I would rather spend $ on something he can play w/ on his own that won't injure himself. Please consider this before buying this item."
2,High Hopes...Disappointed...should have listened to others..,"Oh, I liked the idea of this toy so much, and I had such high hopes. I read the bad reviews and against their advice, bought it...thinking that we would have a different opinion. I should have listened...my daughter spins it once, pulls it off it's base, swings it around acouple times, and then drops it and is off to something more interesting. To be fair, we haven't had any problems with it going off by itself (which we have had with the Leap Frog learning table, but only when the batteries are low - and the Table IS DEFINATELY worth it!). There are many better toys to invest your money in."
3,Noisy,"My daughter loves to hear the music and see the lights. I only have two complaints about it. One is that there is no turn off button and two it is really easy to get off of the holder which makes it hard for babies to spin it several times. Very neat idea, but if these two things were changed, it would be much better!!!"
2,MAKE THE BAD TOY STOP!!!!!!!!!,"I bought this for my daughter when she was five months old. It looked like fun but when we got it home she was not very interested in the toy itself, but preferred the base. She hit herself in the face a few times with it before I took it away and put it on the shelf. That's when the spookiness started. That night at three a.m. it went off by itself for several minutes, woke her up and creeped me out. That sort of thing continued to occur even after I'd butted it against the bookshelf and placed burp cloths in between to prevent motion. She rarely played with it and never more than a minute at a time. I agree, that toy is posessed, and NEEDS an off switch. It woke us all up dozens of times, wasn't played with enough to be worth the money or the mini heart attacks, and I strongly urge you not to buy it."
1,This toy is possessed!,"This toy was a gift from my daughter's God-parents. It is so loud that it scares her. It's sensory overload. She never plays with it so we stuck it up in her room. Well, at 4 am one morning it goes off by itself! Wakes me up through the monitor and startles her! It is constantly going off by itself. It's freaky! There is no way to turn it off and I'm not even sure where the batteries go. After reading the safety concerns, I'm thinking of pitching it! If you are looking for sensory stimulation for your little one, there are much better toys out there!"
2,Sesame Street Sanity Atom,"A toy that provides a true test for your sanity. No On/Off switch which many have mentioned and few love. But, thats not the only reason it gets a low rating. The toy really doesnt DO much. It spins and makes funny noises and plays music (allbeit bad music) but what do children learn? Nothing as far as I can tell. I actually purchased this toy --with real money--such a sin. I got it because my son loved it in the store. I should have just left it there. Dont waste your money!"
5,Star Trek Baby,Bought this as a gag gift! It had Warf in it so it was a winner! So brought back memories from growing up watching Star Trek.
1,Paramount's answer to the recession,"Since there are already several fan collectives on the market, this release is a little suspect. A ""best of"" is always subjective (based on advertising dollars? most popular? etc.), and although these episodes have a lot going for them, like the previous reviewer noted, there are a number that might have been better for a ""best of"" collection. My guess is that Paramount is trotting a series of these collections out to help recession-proof their company. In a few years they'll probably also come up with the ""platinum"" collection. Unless a fan was adamant about getting these episodes, it's probably better to just buy individual episodes through iTunes or some other on-line service."
2,Fuzzy AND No Frills?,"The disk only contains four episodes: ""Best of Both Worlds, Parts I & II"", ""Yesterday's Enterprise"", and ""The Measure of a Man"", and doesn't have any special features, bonus footage, commentary, etc. So why does it look like it was video recorded from a television station using an analog signal and then transferred from a worn out video cassette to a DVD disk? With today's digital technology, there is no reason for a DVD to be sold looking this bad. Especially since the entire disk has less than four hours of viewable content."
5,Styar Trek Next Generation,"I bought two of these for my grandchildren, who are Star Trek fans. They are a good pick of some of the better episodes. They enjoyed both DVDs."
1,Won't play - seems like some type of bootleg DVD,"This DVD won't play in my DVD player. It seems like some sort of home made DVD, with the purple type backing which is similar to DVD-R or home recordable DVD's."
3,Strolling Through the Park,"Granted, the album cover is arguably one of the worst ever, so it is easy to quickly dismiss anything contained inside. But the 1992 release - issued several years after the movie - has some interesting material from the TD lineup of Edgar Froese, Christopher Franke and Johannes Schmoelling.Four of the numbers are brief snippets (between 1:01 and 2:16), but several of the longer tracks - The Letter (Parts 1 and 2), 5:18; Taking the Park (Parts 1 and 2), 8:28; Swatting S.W.A.T., 7:23 - are interesting soundscapes from ""The Blue Years,"" as a number of soundtracks slid into the band's catalog to go along with studio and live releases.This park may not ultimately be like a classic landscape on a wonderful summer day, but it is well worth the walk at some point to check things out."
4,Great for the price,"There are bigger and more thorough kits out there, and some tools maybe higher quality, but these are more than up to the tasks for which they're designed. This saved me a fortune in individual tool purchases and if it came with a chainring bolt wrench would have been all I needed for my single speed conversion project. (i found that tool at a local shop for under 5 bucks). If you need the basic bike tools, this is by far the best bargain I can find!"
4,GREAT FOR RV'S WITH TWO GRAY WATER DRAINS,"This product effectively solves the problem with two gray water drains. However, can't figure out why they do not include a 3/4"" hose cap to close it off when draining the black water. Love buying through Amazon Prime. Saves a lot!"
4,Birds of the World,"This three volume set is quite a buy. The North American Bird Reference book is a delight. Some of the bird names and families are incorrect, but a newer version is available from the original author. Some pictures are not great, but overall the price is fantastic if you only used this CDROM. The Birds of the World and Australia CDROM's are not as thorough, but have some nice movie clips. Overall the latter CDROMS are better than average, but the North American Birds CDROM is still the centerpiece!"
3,Good and bad points,"The program runs well and the bird calls are great, but most birdwatchers see a bird, then want to look it up to see what it is. With this program you must know the name or at least the family group of the bird to look it up. It would be much improved if they had thumbnails from which to select a bird to learn about. Good program for people with previous ornothology knowledge, but kind of useless for the everyday bird watcher."
3,Southern Comfort,"Very similar to Deliverance, but the acting is not good in this movie. Powers Boothe over acts big time! Save your money on this one."
4,It Boldly Goes Where None Has Gone Before!!,"While I'm not an avid sci-fi reader, I couldn't put this book down once I started. The author's attention to detail transported me to heart of the Amazon and placed me on the red planet, where I hung on every twist and turn. The ending left me wanting more. So when's the sequel?"
4,Interesting book,"I received this book in exchange for an honest review. I liked this book. The storyline is interesting. Although, to be honest, the science (even with the help of a dictionary) was over my head. And I have a college degree!! I have always liked science fiction and this book does not disappoint. Some of the characters (for example - Maggie's husband) seem a little to good to be true and therefore remain one dimentional. Other characters in the book are well drawn and defined and therefore, come alive. The ending seemed a little rushed - there didn't seem to be a real ending...just a bunch of questions. Sequel, perhaps?"
5,Excellent Essays from the Leading Historian of FDR,"In this fine collection of essays, William Leuchtenburg provides an excellent companion piece to his masterpiece, Franklin D. Roosevelt and the New Deal. Anyone interested in a general overview of FDR's presidency should check out that book first. This is meant more as a series of insights on highly specific topics, mostly culled from invited lectures that Leuchtenburg has given around the world."
2,Disappointing,"This book did not cover the most important aspects of the amazing presidency of Roosevelt. It rather covered the details of things that were said about him and his opposition. I found a lot of the book to be a waste, for example in the chapter entitled ""FDR and the Kingfish"" the majority of the chapter was written about Huey Long and not about Roosevelt. If you want to learn about what FDR did read the encyclopedia."
3,Not crazy about this program,"I've used the Instant Immersian line for Italian, and I liked it a lot. However, I'm not particularly crazy about the Arabic Audio CD. If you're a novice to the Arabic Language these CDs are a bit too fast, boring and difficult to follow. The dialogues are done in Arabic first then in English, so you're repeating phrases over and over with no clue as to what they mean until interpreted in English. Then the dialogues are of obscure phrases you probably won't use like ""How old is your father"", ""My father passed away 7 years ago"" I would have preferred more basic and useful phrases. I suppose listening to it over and over again you'll begin to pick up a few words here and there out of the conversations. This is CD is better suited for an intermediate Arabic Speaker."
3,Difficult to follow,"The first CD starts out well and the grammar lessons are great, but as the CD goes into the ""prasebook"" part, it becomes difficult to follow (the female speaker, especially, speaks too fast). Oh well, I did pick up a few things at least!"
2,Unclear and very difficult to follow,"I do not recommend this program for the very beginnig student. I used the ""transparent arabic"" program, which focuses more on literacy for a couple hours per day for about six weeks before supplementing it with the instant immersion program. I could not follow even the first two lessons at that point. The speaker does not explain clearly what he is saying, especially during conjugations. It is very difficult to follow for the beginning student. Also, the phrases are not repeated multiple times, which makes it hard to pick up nuances/slight variations between words. Bottom line: get something else and consider this well down the line. Library is a great source to try out multiple programs before wasting money."
2,Disapointed,"with only 2 tracks - too expenxive. Thought I was buying the whole cd, because needing a track for a linedance!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Not what I expected,"I actually ordered this item from another retailer. It was much bulkier than I expected; given that it's supposed to be slim and compact, I was hoping to be able to use it on my short hair. In fact, the area where the plates are is rather thick, and the unit is heavier than any other hairstyler I have ever used. Althought it claims to reduce damage to the hair, I couldn't get past the burnt hair smell when using it on my towel dried hair. Did not like it at all."
4,An interesting plot,"A Dark and Deadly Pool, by Joan Lowery Nixon is a fantastic book! The plot is good, but a little confusing. This book had many twists and turns, and kept me on the edge of my seat."
1,Laurie review of The Dark and Deadly Pool,"The Dark and Deadly Pool wasn't a very good book, and I expected it to be since Joan Lowery Nixon had written it. Most of her other books were very well written and went into great detail, but this book didn't have any of these. It also lacked at other places like it didn't have a interesting plot and it would always jump around and half the time it would not make any since. In my opinion this book was a boring, and was a waste of my time. It was about a teenage girl, who was very tall and could never find any one who liked her,until she met a boy named Fran. Fran worked with her at a Country Club, and things are getting stolen, and someone it going swimming and hanging around after closing time! So I would not recommend this book, en less you like to waste your time. I also feel that Joan Lowery Nixon could of done a way better job."
5,This is a really good book!,"I've just started to read a lot of Joan Lowrey Nixon books, and this one is my favorite one so far. Her mysteries aren't too hard to figure out most of the time, and this one is no exception, but I love the main characters, Liz and Fran. They have so much personality I feel as if they could be my best friends. The dialogue between them is always funny, and even though this story is kind of lacking in the mystery and suspense area, it's still a great book. If you want a good mystery book or suspense book by this author try ""The Seance"", ""The Kidnapping of Christina Lattimore"", or ""Wispers From the Dead"""
2,it wasnt that good.,i luv joan lowery nixon but this book wasnt that good it was all over the place it was funny then romantic then flat and boring and i did this a book report and was hard to finish and the ending wasnt good at all it didnt finish the ending it wasnt good! but all of her other books were great
2,Disappointed,"This cd doesn't have all the great music I've noticed in the series, just maybe one or two songs, so I would not recommend this product. I don't understand why they excluded so many outstanding selections when they put this weak product together, doesn't make sense. I gave it as a birthday gift, too, and it was as disappointing to the receiver as it was to me, maybe moreso."
4,weeds soundtrack,"Good cd just not enough songs, the one I wanted wasn't even on it, they need an updated cd"
3,HEY KIDS - BE THE FIRST ON YOUR BLOCK!,"Malvina Reynolds' ""Little Boxes"" is indeed an older song. Still not funny to the people of Daly City, who DO live in boxes that are red, green, yellow and purple. When you become a doddering old grandpa trying to explain the significance of NIRVANA's ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"", and your grandkids are staring back blankly, you'll come to understand the respect that is shown here for a song that ripped the flesh off the mindless masses of the 1950's - which are trying to re-assert themselves today (read any newspaper lately?). Aside from Roy Zimmerman, there are no satirists working today that have the bite and charm of Malvina. Her song about the mouse that f***cked up the computer was 40 years ahead of its time. Let's talk, after you put on a few more years!"
4,Fashion Statement,"A wonderful pair of gloves. Deerskin takes gloves to a higher level. Soft and supple, probably not durable. I have cowskin gloves for hard work. These are Sunday dress up gloves. The only drawback is the color is yellower than the picture. Not ugly but does not coordinate with my jackets and coats. Would have been five star but for the color."
5,Good quality glove- Motorcycle Use,"I bouoght these gloves for winter use on my motorcycle. Well Lamonts makes a good quality work glove. I specifically got these gloves becasue of two things:1. there isn't a reinforce palm (which bunches up while I control the throttle)2. it has 100 mg insulation (similar to snowboarding gloves).I generally wear a medium in gloves for a tight fit. I bought large just in case I wanted to slip in a liner glove for extra insulation. large fits perfect and over time im sure the glove will soften and stretch and become more loose. As of right now, they fit snug since they are brand new. Its very warm and should hold up for a few years of riding. Deerskin is more delicate than cowhide, so Im sure it wont last as long."
5,Performance plus!,I installed recommended KYB shocks on the front and the rear of my 1985 El Camino replacing the leaking not that old air shocks on the rear and basic stock replacement type shocks on the front. I did add an Air Lift bag kit #60733 1000 in the rear coils which was simple to install and around $90. Wasn't needed but nice to have to balance things out and by some slim chance I would carry something heavy in the box. Also installed a set of 4 moog coils to replace originals. Ride was improved greatly and felt more in tune with the road. Very pleased with the performance and improved handeling of the El camino. I have heard nothing but good info. about KYB shocks online and in auto magazines.
5,"Brilliant record, buy this!","I had not heard of Paul Kelly or Uncle Bill previously but I discovered them via Kasey Chambers, a fellow Aussie who featured Uncle Bill (the band) and Paul on two songs from her debut CD. Those two songs, Heartbreak/Heartmend and I Still Pray were great so I went looking to find out who these guys were. Well, I found out that PK is an Aussie legend and Uncle Bill was this very talented bluegrass band. I bought ""Smoke"" and was not disappointed a bit. Paul's songwriting and vocals are perfect for bluegrass. The instrumentation and playing is superb all around. This is a CD crying for a sequel and although you may pay more for an import, this is a must for any ""alt country"", bluegrass, or fan of great songwriters and heartfelt music."
1,"First batery was bad, but MobileCity replaced it fast and free","Battery arrived quick, but the blister pack was unsealed and the battery was uncharged and unchargeable.I left a poor vendor review before I bothered to try to contact the company. Dopey.MobileCity got in touch with me and sorted everything out very quickly. I've no reason to think it would have been any different if I called them before rating them.Sadly, it seem I can edit this product review, but not change the star rating. Go figure. I'd be happier if Amazon would just delete my comment."
5,An Essential Part of My Morning,"This is a compendium of Brennan Manning's works designed for daily reflections. The man is a genius in addressing the soul life of an aging Irish Catholic ex Jansenist.This Book, along with Oswald Chambers' 'My Utmost for His Highest', sets the tone for my Day---every day."
5,Wonderful,"I love Brennan Manning's writings, and to have short passages for each day is a great way to keep a positive perspective."
3,Outdated; has been revised,"This is an outdated edition of this book. It has gone through extensive revision - including the title (the world ""natural"" has been removed to reflect the anthropogenic changes the Indians made in their environment).Check out:http://www.amazon.com/California-Indians-Their-Environment-Introduction/dp/0520256905/ref=pd_sim_b_2"
4,AWESOME,THIS A WONDERFUL BOOK FROM A WELL KNOWN AUTHOR ROBERT HEIZER.THIS BOOK A WEALTH OF INFORMATION ON CALIFORNIA NATIVE AMERICANSAND THERE CULTURE.GREAT TO ADD TO YOUR COLLECTION.A++++NORTHERN CALIFORNIA NATIVE AMERICAN SURVIVAL.
1,Extremely Disappointed,"This toy is extremely useless and not worth the money. I bought it for my 3 month old son and he could not even reach the only ""one "" toy that hangs from it. He could not see himself in the mirror and could barely fit under it. It is useless for a baby. My 4 year old actually liked it more because of all the futuristic sounds it makes and balls that can be thrown down a chute, which is all it really does. The commerical makes it seem like a fun toy but it isn't. It was a waste of money and you can't even return it because once it is built it cannot come apart(it says so on the instructions). I guess Fisher Price knew they made a horrible toy and wanted to make sure no one could return it."
5,LOVE this toy,"My son is almost 11 months old, and he loves this toy still. It is about the only toy that I can sit him in the floor and he will be satisfied. Now that he is learning to walk it will be good for that too. Its the best gift he has gotten so far."
1,Only dud out of all our presents,"This is a stupid toy. There is no relationship between any of the (loud) random noises and flashes- nothing like Baby Einstein toys, which flash in time to music, for example. Our little guy was confused by the commotion. I thought the ""activities"" were stupid too. Even the assembly was unnecessarily complicated. This is the only thing we didn't use at all."
1,This toy is useless and a waste of money!,"I am so dissapointed in this toy. My son is 5 months old and loves to kick. We bought this for him to use as a play gym. Stage one is useless, the design was poorly constructed. All the lights are on the front of the toy, in stage one your baby stairs at the back of the toy. There is a mirror, and that is it. Other than the mirror, your baby stares at a warning label and the battery slot. I am so upset that I spent the money on this toy. Further more, once you've clicked the blue ""legs"" into the table part, you can't take it apart. Therefore, we can't even return this useless toy. Sure, as my son grows he'll be to watch the balls fall through the activity section on the front. But, the design is so poorly constructed that the ball stops half way down the plank, it is not wide enough for the ball to pass through. Plus, the toys on the side, won't stay in place, and are made out of cheap plastic that can be easily break. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!"
1,Boring,"I purchased this for my baby when she was about 3 months old. There was only one toy hanging down in the center for the ""infant on back"" position and it had to be hit ""just right"" to even play the music. So I put it away until she could sit up, thinking it would have more activities on the front side.She is almost 6 months now and is sitting up so I pulled it out again. Again, there is only 1 dial on the front side that makes it play the music and it is too high for her to reach and too hard for her to turn if she could reach it! She loves it if I sit there and keep turning the dial to make the lights and music work. I am very disappointed in this toy and would not recommend it. Maybe when she's walking, the ""walker"" function will be more fun! So much for the 3-in-1 toy!"
3,doesnt tip!!,I searched high and low for a push walker that does not tip and I finally found it in this toy. It has a wide steady base and low small wheels that doesnt get away from baby. My son didnt use it for a kick gym though since he was 9 months when we bought it. This toy is definitly worth the money!
1,Difficult assembly,"I recently tried to assemble this toy and put one of the legs in backwards because the directions are so poorly written. There is a locking mechanism, therefore the piece will not come out and the toy is now unusable. Fisher-Price customer service was very unhelpful."
1,Couldn't Agree More!,"We received this toy from our son's grandfather as a gift. Our baby is 4 months old and this toy is horrible. I thought I was over-reacting but after reading some of the problems other families have had, they're all the same. He can't even fit under it to see the mirror, much less grab the toy to activate the music. As he was laying down trying to use it in Level 1, the side blue arms slid and landed on his fingers, then again on his arm! This should be taken off the market as far as I am concerned. I read one review about an older child using the 2nd stage, but it doesn't seem much better. This toy might just go into storage until he's one- I don't even want to donate it because it can be harmful. Now, my 3 year old got a kick out of it for about 20 minutes but the noise is too much to keep it around for her!"
1,very disappointed,"I am a grandmother, and a new mother. Fisher-Price is always a company I could rely on for my kids' toys. My new baby is 5 months old. I saw this toy advertise on tv and thought it would be great for her. I agree with all the reviews I've read about this product being the worst I've seen on the market today. I should have read them BEFORE buying the toy. My daughter, too, is scared of the noises. When she lies on the floor, she constantly kicks at it, even with me right there beside her, it happens so fast, one kick and it tilts backwards then comes crashing down on her arms. Once, it even came down on her face and left a bruise! I am so appalled by this toy. I threw away the box the day I bought it, having that much faith that I'd never return a Fisher-Price toy, so now I cannot return it without the box."
3,2 in 1 not 3 in 1,I got this for my daughter when she was 3 months old thinking she would be able to use it to start kicking but it was to small for her and I thought it would light up or something when she kicked but it doesn't. She is only 5 months now and is not yet sitting up so I have to sit her in my lap and play it for her and she does like that but they only thing about that is when I drop the balls it scares her. I hope though she will get good use of it when walks with it.
1,Recall this toy NOW!,This toy is a wast of money and is wary scary. It dose not work on carpet the baby just falls forward when they go to walk. On hard wood it gose to fast. My daughter got a black eye from it at 7 months. Do not buy this toy!
4,Misleading Rating,"The number of stars I have given this toy is misleading. My daughter has loved this toy since she was about 9 months old. She loves putting the balls in the hole and listening to the music. She plays with it morethan anything else. However, now that she is beginning to walk, we have a problem. If I am not there to hold down the back of it, the toy will tip forward. I did contact Fisher-Price. They are sending me a label to ship it back and will give me my money back. I think I spoke so someone in either the recall or safety department. They were very helpful and nice.I hate to send it back though because she loves it and it is durable."
1,What a waste of money,I was lucky and did not purchase this item for by 6 month old. His Aunt did. When he was a smaller the only way he could play with it was to be stuck up underneath it with his little legs folder up. Who wants to lay like that. Anytime he moved he would push the toy away and there was no more playing. Needless to say it was soon put in the closet never to be used again. Mabey it will work better for him when he starts walking.
2,not for infants who can't sit up,I bought this thinking it would be great toy that my son could grow with. My son is about 12 weeks now and this toy has been sitting in a closet for the last four weeks. It is too small for any infant to lay under. My son at 8 weeks was too long too fit under it. The only way an infant could lay under it and view or reach the toys is if they scrunch up their legs. This is an idiotic way to design a toy because infants tend to kick their legs when they get excited. The toy then either rolls away from them or tips over when the wheels are locked. I am hoping this is something he will enjoy when he starts to sit up and walk;other wise it would be a complete waste of money.
1,Disappointing,For an infant this toy is disappointing. In order to see the dangling Elmo you have to bend the baby's knees and no baby's knees stay that way! It is out of the baby's eyesight because the baby is not underneath it enough to enjoy it. Then the stage 2 is just turning 1 knob on the other side of the panel. Which was not too easy to turn. I can't believe they allowed a lousy product like this on the market.
1,Dissappointment,"I wouldn't recommend this toy to anyone! As others have said, it is poorly designed for the first stage, also, for the walking stage, it is dangerous, no counter balance, the only way my son could use it was if we crawled around after him holding the legs to the ground! If not, he was ready to tople over it because the legs just lift up in the air and over. Luckily I contacted mattel and was able to return it. Please, don't let your toddler try to walk alone with this toy!"
2,Disappointed,"We bought this for our four month old thinking it would be a toy he'd use for awhile with the different levels. I really don't like the stage one for the infant because you have to pull the toy so far over the baby so he can reach the toy that his feet are scrunched, Not to mention but as soon as he starts kicking, it moves and lifts up. It landed on his arm, not good! The buttons on the front you would think help activate it but they don't. Also the front has all these holes so your baby can pull himself up but I'm afraid for when he gets to that stage he would get his fingers stuck or scrape them. I wish we would have pulled this out of the box before we bought it. This is going on the shelf!!"
1,Disappointed,We were given this as a gift for our 4month old. He is now 8 months old and doesn't play with it. It isn't meant for a baby who can't sit up. He is too long to lay underneath it. I thought it was going to keep him entertained but so far he can't play with it. I wouldn't recommend this for a baby-maybe a toddler-I'll have to see when he is bigger.
3,preferred by my toddler,"I recently bought this item for my 4 month old daughter. I had read the reviews but found it for $15 in a Toys R Us store and couldn't pass it up. I was disappointed when I first put my daughter under it. There was no way to put her legs under it and still have her be able to slap at the Elmo that hangs down in the back. Even if she could stretch her legs out, the Elmo is too low to swing and rests on her stomach, and she is small for her age (under 12 lbs).My son, who just turned 2 in September, loved it. He played with this toy for 2 hours non-stop when I first put it together. He put the balls in the top over and over again and watched them come out of the bottom on each side. I hope that my daughter has as much fun with it as she gets older. I gave it three stars because I don't feel that it is constructed well for younger babies, but if my son's reaction is any indication we should get a couple of years worth of play out of this toy."
4,"Three LPs, plus assorted bonus material, all at one low price!","This collection draws together, at an obscenely low price, the terrific album Sonny made with the Modern Jazz Quartet (including a number of great quartet tracks with pianist Kenny Drew), the underrated album Moving Out (with the great Elmo Hope at the keys), and the fine Miles Davis album Dig. It throws in the classic Rollins tracks from the Davis LP Bags Groove along with the Rollins tracks from the Thelonious Monk album entitled Monk and a sample from the album Thelonious Monk and Sonny Rollins. All great stuff and, if you aren't inclined to shell out for all these records separately (and are willing to forego accompanying liner notes, cover art and the like), this quality compilation would do nicely."
2,Not a Rabbit on it.,I ordered this because I collect Spode rabbit dishes. There is no rabbit on the one I was sent. It has quail and ducks. No rabbits. Yet rabbit is the first word in the title. The Rabbit Lady
5,Yeah,"My son usually can't sit still for long periods of time and this book is PERFECT. He loves my exaggerated pronounciation of the text and the pictures are big, bright, and appealing. His favorite book, by far!!"
3,Best of Shemp!,"These are two of the best that feature Shemp. I am a big Curly fan so I find that I don't care as much for Shemp. However, I could watch these two over and over. This DVD is a must for true Stooge fans."
2,short and slightly sweet,"""Full length feature""? Give me a break. The total of less than 45 minutes' viewing on this DVD makes it terrible value despite the cheap price. The episodes shown are moderately funny."
4,Cooking for Two is Difficult,"Southern Living's COOKBOOK FOR TWO cuts the ingredient amounts down to size for small meals. This is difficult for empty nestors, but the book retains many old family favorites.The meal plans do tend to be a bit on the formal side--a trait of all Southern Living books. Plain old kitchen china doesn't spoil the tast of these recipes. Might want to consider some subtitutions to cut fat and calorie content for modern healthful living.Nash Black, author of SINS OF THE FATHERS."
3,Good Start,"As a beginner yogini, these cards are a good start to practicing yoga on my own. I needed something to guide me when I am not able to attend a class. Some poses are too difficult for me however, there are enough cards in the deck to keep me limber and relaxed."
5,Used books are great!,"Great bargain - ""almost new"" looked brand new to me - a book gets more banged around in the store before it's purchased than my used book had."
2,This book makes for a [bad] Chanukah present!,"I was expecting something fun when I opened the box, and while this is entertaining, it isn't really funny.If you are amused by pictures of a dog in a yarmulka, perhaps therapy is in order... BUt if you can't do therapy, this is the perfect book"
1,To much like work.,I play games to relax. This game is way to much like work and poor game play. The toons are kinda funny. But I bought it and it was a waste of money. Even if i only spent 2 bucks for game and 4 bucks for shipping.But if you got the money to spend on a game that isnt any fun then go ahead.
4,Succinct Review,"This slender book appears to be the published version of a thesis. It covers in brief but reasonably complete form the several aspects of Saudi Arabia, its history, the governing family, the economy, politics, the oil story, the Hajj and security. Its prognostications for the future seem reasonable. I was forced to question its accuracy in every category when I found the date of Abdul Aziz's decease given as 1950. Many have followed the leader in stating that he was born in 1880, as does Long, but it is was in fact the year 1876, probably in October or November, that he first saw light and he died in 1953.. The photographs are reproduced on the text stock, thus reducing their intrinsic value.I find the book overpriced. Its page total is 154, which is less than the total given in the blurb."
4,She who must be obeyed mug,"Phrase is just what I was looking for! A reference to the old movie by the same name! My older sister always quoted that line while ""enforcing"" her authority when we were young teens.I had found a mug a few years ago, but it accidentally got broken by her daughter."
4,This is a tight album to bump to!!!,"Charli Baltimore's ""Ice"" is a great album to listen to. With the well known songs such as ""Money and Stand Up"" that get you movin' in clubs and parties all around. This is a album i'll rock to other people to buy!!!"
3,"Decent, but mostly overrated","Its been a few years since this one came out. Stripped down to the bone puts the full emphasis on John's singing and the songs with mixed results. Crossing Muddy Waters is one of his best songs ever. Nothing else comes close to that description. This CD might be the start of his singing become more ragged (or should I say gritty). Its not so bad like the desstruction of Bob Dylan's voice and in concert, he still sounds pretty darn good (just saw him last month).Overall, a few nice songs here but if you are looking at his latter day works, you can do better. Walk On, Tiki Bar and Gruff Exterior are all better. And of course, Little Head is much worse and the latest, Same Old Man is probably not quite as good either."
5,pure voice and soul,"Although I am a huge fan of John Hiatt's and have enjoyed all of his music, this is the John Hiatt that I find the most satisfying: Pure voice and soul - who could ask for anything more!! END"
2,Could have waited a little longer on this one!,"Being a fan of John Hiatt's for 25+ years and owning all of his previous albums, I'm sorry to say this one is a major disappointment. There is very little here to get excited about or to compare with ANY of his previous of his work. There are no stand out efforts, just a three piece band with some tired lyrics in a hurry to finish an album (3 days), and it shows. If you're new to John Hiatt, invest in any of his earlier work starting with ""Riding With the King""(1983) through ""Little Head""(1997) and you can not go wrong. If you are a John Hiatt fan, let your big head do the thinking and skip this one."
2,Three strong tracks,"and that's it. If you have to have everything John Hiatt does, obviously you'll get this one. I wouldn't recommend it to a newbie trying to get a taste of Hiatt's stuff though. Beyond the three good tracks, it's just boring musically and lyrically."
5,Fantastic Acoustic Album,"John Hiatt's music has always been a little difficult to categorize, and this may be one reason he hasn't received the attention he deserves over the course of his career. If Hiatt was overly concerned about this, he wouldn't have released ""Crossing Muddy Waters"", with its unusual blend of musical styles. Fortunately, Hiatt seems to value quality work over huge commercial success, or we'd have missed out on a spectacular album. I don't think there's a weak track on the CD, from the driving opening track ""Lincoln Town"" and the haunting title track, to the uplifting final track ""Before I Go"". The acoustic ""format"" isn't that far removed from some of Hiatt's other work, but it is somewhat of a switch, and Hiatt handled it masterfully. One of the best albums from a guy who always delivers!"
4,Back in Time,"One of the things I love about Johns music is that he takes you to a place in your mind. For me, the CD took me back in time to the early age of the railroads and Huckleberry Finn. I know some Hiatt fans probably wanted more of his upbeat witty flavor on this effort, but Im glad he didnt. I also think what stands out is the crippling effect of raw guitar and vocals, and hearing each string ring and shutter. Its the real deal and he and his team pull it off. Lyrically, he draws you in and takes you for a ride with pure emotion. A little darker than normal. My favorite line is not about the lyrics, but about his timing, in ""Mr. Stanley, he comes in a bit too early. I just picture some guy, alone on a front porch in the middle of nowhere, singing his heart out, mistakes and all."
4,MY FIRST CONTACT WITH GAMMA RAY...,"THis was my first contact with Gamma Ray, and a great one! HAnsen kicks in this album, along with Schlachter and Ralf singing. Great tunes, great metal.!"
1,Disappointed,"We received this toy as a gift this year for our 7 month old. It seems a little too complicated for a 6 month old. However, our 2 and a half year old was taken with the toy immediately. The product features Oscar the grouch who says ""Scram"" continually. Of course, our older daughter ran around yelling ""scram"" for the next few hours. Since then, we have taken the toy away as it does not seem appropriate for such a young child to speak that way. The purchase of this toy seems to be a waste of $10. Your money is better spent elsewhere."
1,sesame street toy,This is one toy that never got played with much at our house. It just was noisy. I do not see the educational value to this particular item and I never really understood what it was supposed to do. Very disappointing.
4,nice,This cleaner does a real nice job without being so toxic that you need to turn on the exhaust fan. Easy to use and efficient in what it does. Will buy again.
3,Tiny but cute,I wear these a lot with jeans. I'm never good at visualzing the size of an item from the description so these earrings were smaller than I thought. But they are adorable. And I do wear them often.
1,Absolutely NOT what I wanted.,I searched for parts to fit a 2006 Honda CR--V. Instead I got plug wires for a Jeep Cherokee V-6. Amazon now wants to charge me more than 25% if the items price to return it. And returns to Amazon are a total hassel. I usually get auto parts from an auto parts store. This time I price shopped and gambled on Amazon. And lost. Not a bargain.
5,Great OE replacement for wires.,"Great cheap replacement for the 1999 Jeep Cherokee 4.0L. Cant really comment on improved performance or anything, since Im running regular Champion Truck plugs, but Im sure the wires will be in par with stock wires at least."
3,"Works well, only after slight modification","Wires seem well manufactured, but had issue with one of the boots. Installed new wires and seemed my power had decreased a bit after a weeks driving. Upon further review, noticed arcing was occurring with one of the boots - was too long and didn't have good contact with the plug. Quick trim to the boot, cleaned the contacts, and was not able to hear a clear click as good contact was not made with the plug."
4,Great Book!,This book is a great book to understanding makeup artistry! It goes over every aspect of being a professional in the beauty and makeup industry. It does go into some scientific detail but explains the need for the information in a practical way. A very helpful book and highly recommended.
4,Good reference material.,"Pretty thorough coverage of modern makeup. It doesn't call out the new Hollywood looks in particular, the underlying technique is all there."
5,There ARE reasons to keep tryin'!,"As a 31 year white female there is now way to truly understand how different life is for teenagers today, but ""Why Keep Tryin'"" has brought me as close as I could possibly come to true understanding of today's youth. The poetry and the artwork in the book is amazing. It's hard to believe that people that young are already so talented. What is even more difficult to believe is how much these young people have been through in such a short time. Most of the poems appear by their maturity and content to be written by people at least twice the age of the poets.I commend these young people for sharing their inner most thoughts, hopes, dreams with me and hopefully many more people!If you have a teenager or know a teenager--get this book for them AND yourself."
1,WORST CARD EVER!,Does not run with any new games. Out of date card. BUY SOMTHING ELSE! This card is so bad it should be locked away forever!Not worth the box it is put in. Terrible Again DO NOT BUY. i am writing this review so other people dont have the same problems i had. Spend more money on a better card
5,A must read,This is a great book for all those people interested in spirituality and in elevating their spirits and their souls
1,5-cup? I don't think so,"I'm sure the action on this sifter is terrific like other reviewers say, but it's too small for me to even bother with. Don't know if I can send it back, haven't had time to try yet. If you want something that you don't have to stop and reload all the time, this isn't the sifter for you."
4,Great Sifter,"This 5-Cup Rotary sifter is great. It has 4 sifting wires, rather than 2, and also the screen holes are much closer together than most sifters. This seems to make a finer textured cake. Well worth the money."
5,Just like Mother's,"I was so happy to find this product. I had looked everywhere and my brother came to visit, so I told him about it and he came to the computer and looked it right up. I ordered it right away and when it came, I made a pan of biscuits. Of course, everyone was so happy: we had potato gravy, biscuits, and sliced tomatoes.You cannot go wrong with this sifter, it is just like Mother'sThanks,Sandy Clark"
5,Comparison to Bromwell's 5-Cup Rotary Sifter,"""Best"" is smaller than Bromwell's - it fits 4 cups of flour, so I think 5-Cup in the product description is misleading. It is smaller in both diameter and height, but it is big enough for most of my baking needs.""Best"" has the rotary mechanism with 4 wires - same as Bromwell's. However, the mesh on the ""Best"" has smaller holes than Bromwell's, and the mesh screen itself is connected to the sifter's body much better than on Bromwell's. Bromwell's was letting flour fall through the gap around the mesh screen, and there is no gap around the mesh in ""Best"".Bottom line - this is a very good quality rotary sifter, and if 4-cup size is enough for you, I would recommend ""Best"" over Bromwell's."
2,Not good enough!,"Davis is new in composing, he's good in orchestration but not a good composer yet. He did his job well in Matrix since the movie didn't require a theme, so Davis was great choice. But in a movie like Jurassic Park, even though he uses the themes by Williams, I expected some new themes. There's one but not good enough, actually really bad compared to the original themes. There's only one track which is ""good"", track 8. So, the reason that I rated this with 2 stars is that, there aren't more tracks like 8. But if I rate track 8 only, I rate it 4 stars. Buy this if you collect scores. But don't expect a masterpiece like the first or the second."
4,"Don Davis is very good, but he's no John Williams....","Well, duh. NOONE is John Williams. Williams is without a doubt the best film composer in history. Don Davis picks up respectivly for the third movie in the best film series ever. But his music lacks Williams brilliance. Sure, he uses the two main themes from the original Jurassic Park, and he uses them very well, but Jurassic Park III really has no main theme for itself. Maybe it does, and if so, I'd place my money on the music at the beginning of track 12 (Bone Man Ben.) Nevertheless, this is an acceptionally amazing score. Track 16 (Big Hat, No Cattle) is corny but very very entertaining. All in all, this score is recommended to any fan of Jurassic Park, positive of negative."
4,Jurassic Park III: The Lost Score,"Longtime Williams and Davis fans will love this soundtrack!. don't get me wrong The this CD is over all not as good as the first one. the theme in track 1,2,12,15 This is probably one of the greatest themes that Williams has done. If you want a good theme,there is no better soundtrack to get by Don Davis. This is one fantastic CD. The track 2, is awesome masterpiece of music. It has plenty of cool themes. I hate track 16, ""Big Hat no Cattle""... it sucks!, come on! not on a Jurassic Park soundtrack. but if you don't have Jurassic Park get it first. If you get JP first you enjoy JP3 alot more."
2,As bad as the film.,"The problem with this score is that it doesn't provide you with anything new. It just takes the classic John Williams theme and screws it up. Nothing more. I'm a HUGE fan of Jurassic Park and the Lost World: Jurassic Park. But when I was watching Jurassic Park three, the music didn't drive the movie like it did in the first two. Every time I heard it, it sounded like a screwed up version of the classic theme. This soundtrack is just as dissapointing as the movie. Don't waste your money."
2,Hillarious,"The movie was hillarious, and a few of the musical moments sounded moderately alright. I wasn't impressed. The soundtrack before it wasn't all too good either. I have decided not to purchase this new soundtrack only because the movie was horrible, yet fun to laugh at since it made absolutely no sense. I wouldn't want anything to help me remember specific moments from that film. I did hear the main theme repeated at times when it wasn't really necessary. It only made me flinch. If there is a score to be bought this year then it is the score to A.I: Artificial Intelligence and not Jurassic Park 3. My God, when are they going to stop making such films?!"
2,Very disappointing,"One would think that it would be hard, if not impossible not to compose a decent score when one has two sources of John Williams to use and get inspiration from. Don Davis, who I was only familiar through The Matrix, has composed an uneven and disppointing third installment. While I enjoyed some of his action cues and his orchestratioins of the two main JP themes, for the most his original music is uninspiring. You get some indications while listening that Davis composed a moving, sweeping theme of his own,i.e.Track 11. The string theme is good, but as it turns out very underdevloped compared with Williams' two orginial themes. And what about Track 15. Are the End Credits only two minutes long. What we should have been treated to is a fully developed theme of Davis' own. And he should have composed that becuase the best parts of this CD are when he borrows from Williams. I guess Davis should be credited for trying, but that is about it!"
4,You almost can't tell it isn't Williams.,"Being the first series entry not directed by Steven Spielberg, it should come as no big surprise that Jurassic Park III is also the first series entry not to be scored by John Williams. Not that you could tell all that much, composer Don Davis worked very hard to make his score sound as if Williams himself had done the honors, striving to keep the score sounding as similar to the previous entries as possible. The result is a score that at first appears a seamless continuation of Williams work, but then Davis's new themes and touches bleed through. This score is no boring retread. Recommended."
4,Unusual and lovely!!!,"This necklace is a very unique piece of jewerly with a beautiful blue topaz stone. I love the way the bars next to the stone move so freely. Just like a little work of art, very lovely and a great everyday kind of necklace to wear anywhere."
5,Awesome sound!,"I absolutly love the music of this band! It has its own sound that is unmistakeable from anything else that is groovy, energetic and makes you want to move to it. The musician ship is very good with intelligent lyrics...its hard not to like this band."
4,Wonderful!,"This is Kiki in Kiki's own voice, no one could say it better.This is a wonderful book for those who love Bohemian Paris, and even those who don't."
2,Turban misses point.,"The product arrived quickly but I was disappointed upon opening the package. The turbin was quite small and would not be sufficient for anyone with long or thick hair. My daughter has shoulder length thin hair and she even had trouble getting it on. It is terribly thin and, therefore, would miss the point of being used to wrap wet hair to absorb the moisture after washings. My daughter now only used the turbin occasionally to keep her hair dry while washing her face. Usually though, she says the difficulty in getting it on just isn't worth the trouble."
5,Awesome product,I use this for the gym and it has served me well. I just pop it on my head before I get out of the shower and it always holds my hair well until I get this chance to style it. Good for holding your hair when you want to put on your makeup too.
5,Great Book,What a great book that deals with the issue of anger for parents... have taken several parents through this workbook and have seen great things since.... Super fast shipping .... great deal!!! A+++++++++++
5,The Best Band in Houston!,"I heard the CD and it just blew me away! I loved all the songs. Cremator is so talented,they are the best band in Houston! I think anyone and everyone who likes Metal should listen to the CD and they too will be blown-away by this great band! I can't stop listening to the CD. I mean this band gives me so much energy by just jamming out to them,so I have to listen to them every single day! All I have to say is that anyone who wants to listen to a true metal band,needs to purchase Cremator's ""The Fight to Stay Alive"" and they won't be disappointed."
2,Seems like a knockoff,"Sent with no box and unmatching tissue paper. These are my 3rd pair (First from this co.) but these are starting to fall apart after just a few times walking around (not skating or anything....actually just DRIVING around....not even walking.)I called and emailed numerous times trying to get a box. (Even though I paid full price for the shoes, I was willing to pay extra for the box.)No response from sellers for weeks....then got an email, ""So, you want us to send you a box?"" We don't have it anymore.""All of this makes me think they are cheap knockoffs...Very poor customer service/communication.Shoulda just bought them at the skateshop.=("
2,these look cool but they tear easily.,when i first got these shoes i thought they looked so cool.but when i started skating them after a month i had a giant hole on the side with my mom not willing to buy me a now pair i put gorilla tape on the side for a while until the bottom teared open!!!!!!! i would recommend the half cab pro because there more durable
4,works with contour changing pad,"I see a review that states this product does not work with the contoured changing pad and that is wrong. It works perfectly! I would have given the item 5 stars, but my baby is not here yet and I have not gotten to use the changing pad with her on it. However, it does fit perfectly on the countoured changing pad."
3,Not what I expected,"This is a picture of the majestic siberian tiger. I ordered it, and unfortunately, it wasn't quite what I expected. It is basically what it looks like, but the eyes are fake; edited in or something. All in all it is a decent little poster, but if you are looking for a more realistic poster, I'd skip this one."
5,A Great Twenty-Something Dollar Rod,"I do a lot of backcountry fishing in the Sierra Nevada. Having broken many a rods while ducking under a fallen tree, low hanging branch, or while dropping a pack I am reticent to spend too much on a rod. This one has performed admirably over the last summer. Using 2 lb. test and a moderately broad range of trout lure sizes it has casted very well. The action is very nice for hooking as well. Moreover, the real cork remains pleasant feeling in one's hands."
5,great,Perfect action for trout spinning from my kayak or walking the banks of my favourite trout stream. Also good on smallish bass
5,Good product,"I bought 6 of this, they are well made and very easy to assemble, not heavy but sturdy, and look good too. All parts were nicely packed and well protected. I am thinking to buy another 2 to expand my dining set. Very happy about this purchase. Oh, I bought a table from Ikea to match with these chairs, and they look perfect!"
4,Good product,"The chairs are of good quality and a great price, easy to assemble. A little delay with shipping and communication between Visiondecor and Amazon was a little confusing, but overall we're satisfied."
4,Great chairs for price,"Very stury, well-made chairs. Excellent value. The seat tapers, and is narrower where it connects to back than at front, but still quite comfortable. Easy assembly--first chair took me 30 minutes, the second one 20. Allen wrench included, but you do need a screwdriver."
1,to short,The chair is too short for my table. It took 2 1/2 weeks for them to come in. They where nice and was easy to put togethert but they're not sturdy for everyday use. The finish is nice and they look good. I didn't want them and wanted to return it but it was going to cost me what I paid for them to deliver to me and then pay for me to ship them back I would be left with almost nothing so I just kept it . I needed 12 chairs but I wanted to sample it first thank G-D I only bought 2
4,Very nice chairs,"Wonderful value in these chairs. Very comfortable, easy to assemble. Happy with purchase and plan to buy more soon."
5,Cappuccino Chairs,"We are enjoying our two new Cappuccino chairs very much. Although I've never put a piece of furniture together before, I found it very easy to do so. All the needed hardware was included, and visual instructions were foolproof. They are slim and elegant but even large men are comfortable in them. In fact, I intend to order two more."
3,Good chairs for the price.,"Look just like the picture, wood is that color.Easy to put together.Not the sturdiest chairs, but decent...especially for the price you pay."
1,looks great but assemby sucks,"The quality is not worth the price. The chairs look great but the assembly was the worst I have ever had to put together. The screws are not cut well and the allen wrench does not fit in it. In fact, the assembly is going so badly that I am ready to throw the chairs out. I will never buy this brand again. Maybe the company should test their products and assembly once in a while.2 hours later and I still do not have 2 chairs put together, I am so glad I did not order 4. this is the worst assembly of my life. I do not recommend this brand to anyone. Or pay someone else to put them together. I think I made up a few new cus words tonight."
4,Good stuff for the price,"We received the package on time, no damage. It was not hard to assembling it but I wish the connector could be a little stronger. Good looking chairs for guest dinning room if you are not going to sit on it 24/7."
4,"Nice chairs, but a bit of a pain to put together.","We bought 2 sets of these chairs to go with our kitchen table. Putting them together was a bit of pain, and they were a bit wobbly. But nothing that some felt pads didn't fix, which I was going to put on them anyways. Had to re-tighten the chairs after a few months, but they still look great and haven't had any issues or problems with them. We just ordered another set of 2."
4,Adds nice touch,"For the price I got them at, I can't believe how great a chair they are. They look great and are pretty darn comfortable for mealtime. We're not talking about the creation of a $3,000 dining suite, but instead a simple freshening of something we already have. This chair takes care of it fine. Though light in weight, they're very solid, so don't be worried when you have guests who are at the 250 lb or greater mark. At $198 for 4 chairs, I'm still in shock I found this solid of value. Amazon does it again!"
5,Review by Alice,I found this book very interesting and informative. It has helped me to see how the mind works in sickness and how difficult that life must be. It has helped me to understand that a sick mind has no control and to be patient with people who have mental illness. I think this was a very good book. Alice B.
3,Disappointing for a Leap Frog toy,"Usually the quality of Leap Frog toys is excellent, but this one needs to go back to the drawing board. We've had this since last Christmas and the money always gets stuck and requires some major coaxing to get it unstuck. This happens every time there is more than 3 coins in the bottom tray. Everything else about it is great. It provides a great way for preschoolers to become familiar with coins and adding them, but the flawed designed leads to unnecessary frustration. Unfortunately, I haven't found another cash register that is any better than this one."
2,Leap Frog Cash Register,"My children loved this toy because it was fun and made alot of sound. However, the coins did get stuck all the time and were not easy to get out. This last time several got stuck so my husband proceeded to unsrew the thing to get them out. After he had pretty much taken the whole thing apart we still couldn't get to the coins. Let's just say it went in the trash and we won't be buying another one after reading the other reviews. Thanks but no thanks."
2,Jams jams jams!,"The coins jam in ours very easily, We got it as a gift last christmas and it has been more of a pain than anything. When it works it is cute a little loud. I can't get this last jam unstuck, I'll probably end up thowing it out."
3,Not as good as other Leap Frog toys,"I am a big fan of Leap Frog toys. My son loves them. But, this toy doesn't measure up to their normal standards. My son still loves to play with it and it teaches him great things. But, it is so loud! And every time it's turned on it starts out at the loudest setting. You can't turn it down without your child noticing and turning it back up. I have tried covering the speakers with packing tape, which has worked on all of the other Leap Frog toys, but it is still tremendously loud. Another thing that happens is the coins get jammed up. I am able to get them out with a flexible small spatula, but it happens almost every time my son plays with it. It is still a good toy that keeps my son interested, but it could use some improvements."
4,Very educational!,"It's an educational toy albeit an expensive one. It's great for preschoolers teaching them numbers, addition and coin value. The only problem we found was that the coins tend to get stuck often although there is a door to unscrew if that happens but still it's a pain to get a screw driver everytime.I would also recommend getting the shopping cart with this to get the full value and especially if your kids are more interested in the shopping part of it."
4,Smart designers,We got the cash register and shopping cart for my daughter and she loves both. The coins do get stuck but it is well made and will with stand the test of time. THE BIG PLUS!! My 16 month old son however decided to put an object in the cash register (a play knife) and it went all the way in. I thought at first there went [$$$] but as I was about to take it apart there is a place on the side to unscrew and withdraw the foreign object. How smart! THANK YOU. So we are back in business and love it.
3,coins stuck a lot,"Apparently leapfrog was aware their coins get stuck (and often) because they put a special door on the side to unstick them. Unfortunately, you have to unscrew the door, it doesn't have an easy latch. As a result, by the time you're done unscrewing the door to unstick the coins, then putting the door back on, the child has run off to play with something else."
2,Disappointing,My daughter would probably like this toy if the coins didn't constantly get stuck! It's very annoying because you have to keep sticking a knife inside to move the coins. My daughter gets so frustrated with it that I had to get rid of it.
2,Waste of Money,"The coins get stuck soo easy .... I know what you are thinking .. when my child gets this I will not let him get all the coins stuck in the toy .. boy are you going to be surprised. When I bought this last year for Chrismas, my son had just turned 3 years old and even after reading all the reviews with some saying it was awesome and some saying that the coins would get stuck, I thought to myself that I would not let my son put too many coins in .. but it happened so fast. Within a few weeks, it was ruined. Please don't be like myself and I am sure others and think that it won't happen to you, because it will."
4,great with the shooping cart,"I bought this for my family day care. The kids love the cash register, but my 2 1/2 yr old has learned to find a butter knife every time she plays with it because the coins get stuck everytime. We just leave the side panel off for easy access. Leap frog just says ""thanks for the comments"". It is a great learning tool especially with the shopping cart, but plan on stressing out over the stuck coins."
3,Pretend and Learn Cash Register,"The educational value is very good. I have a 4 year old and a two year old and the different levels allow both to enjoy the toy and learn at their own pace. However, the coins are constantly getting stuck inside when either one of my children play with it, leaving me to fix the jam with a nail file."
4,The coins continually get stuck!!!,"I got this toy for my 2 year old who is obsessed with money and cash registers. If she didn't love the plastic coins and pressing the buttons so much, I would take this toy right back to the store. The coins continually get stuck and I have found that the only way to unstick them is by jamming a butter knife into the chute to free them--something I'm not willing to let my 2 year old do--and so she is constantly bringing it to me to fix. This is a terrible problem for [an expensive]toy and the manufacturer knows about it because its on the FAQ section of their website. I'm terribly disappointed that an expensive toy is so poorly designed. There are cheaper cash registers that actually work."
4,Great pick,"We got this toy for Christmas and within hours, my three year old was recognizing the difference between the coins. We're very pleased with it."
1,A Toy I Actually Hate,"My son's grandmother bought this for him since she knew I wanted him to have a cash register. First of all, except for the nice ringing sound when you open the till, it doesn't remotely function like a real cash register. It barrages your child with songs and requests to ""scan a price tag or drop in a coin"". Thanks to the plastic casing around the coins they are all the same size which makes it hard to distinguish them. As this toy has no dollar bills, all the prices are in cents which is laughable. The till barely holds all the coins and there is no place to store the price tags. My son never plays with it."
4,Coins get STUCK|,The toy is a nice way for kids to play. We got it for our (4 years old) for Christmas.The annoying thing is the coins getting stuck. I have to keep a piece of hanger wire around to push the stuck coins.
2,"Great intentions, only one complaint","This is a great learning toy, but my ONLY complaint is that the coins get stuck in the drop slot. When my 3 year old got this toy for his birthday he was very excited. After about 5 minutes of playing with it, the coins got stuck in the machine...and he lost interest. Everytime he plays with the cash register, I end up having to get the screwdriver out to ""unplug"" the stuck coins. It interrupts play and therefore he moves on to a different toy."
5,Great Learning Money Toy!,"My son loved this toy and in no time was telling me about money. Its fun, keeps the attention (which my son has problems with but this held his greatly!) seems durable specially with how ruff he gets at times, colorful, and a leap frog product - great learning"
1,stop talking and let them explore,"Sigh. It's a really CUTE cash register. The money is adorable, too - looks pretty real and is enclosed in plastic rings that make them much less of a choking hazard. The whole thing looks so friendly, until you turn it on and it starts yelling. Even after adjusting the volume the talking is incessant - any push of a button results in one or two sentences about that activity. Maybe a toy for learning the exact things LeapFrog has in mind, but not a toy for old-fashioned pretend and exploration. Too bad. It's so cute. Maybe one day they'll add a ""no talk"" mode."
5,Fun toy but hard keep up with!,"I love this toy becouse it teaches my boys about money. The only thing I don't like is that the money always gets stuck in the slot. It does have an opening to get the money out, but you need a screwdriver. So every time they put the money in to quickly after another, I have to go find my hand screwdriver. My boys have a great time playing with this cash register. If this one ever broke, I would go out and by another one. It is the best on I have found."
3,"Great Concept, Poor design","I bought this cash register for my 33 month old son for Christmas. I thought that it would be a great learning toy for him. He was really excited about playing with it, but in the first 15 minutes of playing with it, the coins jammed up 3 times. My husband and I agreed that even though the learning concept was great, the trouble of unjammimg the coins every 5 minutes was ridiculous. We took the cash register back to the store. We have not replaced it. We're still looking for a better design. We were surprised that such a poorly designed toy was a Leap Frog toy."
1,Coins read wrong and get jammed constantly,"Was given this as a gift. Was really excited because my girls love the kitchen toys but have never had a register. They loved it...until they got the coins jammed right away. I got the coins out with a knife but then my 5 year old broght it to me saying it wasn't recongnizing her coins right. Sure enough, you put in a dime it says it is a penny, or a quarter, or a nickle, or sometimes the dime is actually a dime. It would do this with all the coins. Must have been a manufacture defect that it doesn't recongnize the coins right, but obviously I can't let my kids play with a toy that has NEGATIVE education value (makes them dumber for playing with it!) what a shame to put the leapfrog name on."
2,Avoid this LeapFrog,"I usually love Leap Frog - but beware...Our register may have been a ""lemon"" but it just didn't work...The coins kept getting stuck and we would have to shake them to get them loose...This happened constantly...It really frustrated my children...There is nowhere to store the ""swipe"" cards, so they easily get lost...Although my children seemed to enjoy the toy, getting it to work and having the accessories easily attached would have made this toy a winner...Taking the time to improve this toy prior to making it available to the public should have been a priority for this otherwise reliable company..."
2,Disappointed,"I just got this toy for my 4 year old daughter and am extremely disappointed. Having played with it for only a couple of hours she managed to get stuck in it a couple of coins. Understandably, she immediately lost her interest in the toy and I had to spend 10 minutes trying to figure out which set of tools to use to unstuck the coins in the plastic cash register without any luck, unfortunately.I've had the same ""success"" with the leap frog stuffed frog before and tend to believe that these products are not very durable."
3,Interesting Idea - Poor Design,"I bought this toy as a Christmas present for my 3 year old. It looked very educational and interesting. However, there are some design quirks that were disappointing. First, when the register is turned on, it starts at high volume. You can adjust the volume, but the start up is very loud.Second, the coins can get stuck in the ""slide."" Smaller children don't realize if you put in more than one coin (before waiting for it to come out at the bottom), they can get jammed inside the register. The first day we had the register, coins got stuck 4 times, requiring us to bang the toy on the floor to jar them loose.I would recommend this toy for older children who can play with it carefully, but younger children won't have as much fun. My son hardly plays with it."
2,"D-level accompaniment, even Andrews can't overcome record","This recording is also known as ""Love, Julie"". Recorded in 1990, the syntho backup is abhorrent, and her nodes were bothering her. Anyone who loves Julie will be sorely disappointed, and should pass this one by. Still, if you are a fan who must have everything to complete their collection, as I am, for the price, do it - even though I do not listen to my recording and opt for my old records. (It's a shame SONY MUSIC doesn't re-release her '60s recordings and RCA do the same with her '50s British recordings.)"
3,"Information not ""restoration""","This is a great book of information , but definately NOT a ""restoration"" guide. It provides good information about the options and details to each year make and model but not much more. If you are looking for details about restoring your car (chalk marks, correct finish's, fasteners, etc) keep looking elsewhere. There are also numerous errors contained in this book as well as the ""Charger, Roadrunner, Superbee Authentic Resto Guide"" written by the same author, no surprise there! Buy it for the information, but don't think you're gonna take home any show trophies after reading it ."
2,not a restoration book!,"If you want to know what the proper tire pressure for a 'cuda or challenger was or what color the aircleaner was, get this book. If you want help or guidance fixing up your car, look elsewhere. This book will tell you all about what the original specifications were for these cars (which might be helpful to some) but has no information on how to repair them to the point where knowing which direction a sticker faced would help."
3,"Good E-body reference, but...","This book is well organized and has a plethora of useful information, including part numbers and photographs. However, the author appears to be chiefly interested in the ""E-body"" cars (1970-74), as opposed to the ""A-body"" Barracudas (1967-69). The amount of information on the A-bodies is disappointingly small, and I noted several statements that are factually incorrect, as well as overly sweeping generalizations, and confusions between similar features. I personally am mainly familiar with the A-body cars, and I am willing to give the author the benefit of the doubt and assume that the E-body information is accurate. I am even willing to recommend this book to A-body owners, with the caveat not to take every statement at face value -- the part numbers and other statistical information are probably worth the price."
2,sounds in search of music,"I own a number of Joe Morris recordings, and found this piece only mildly distracting, eventually dull. For the person who loves to ponder every scrap on the table at garage sales, you may flourish in this sound environment of one guitar emitting repetitive bursts of semi-interesting plucks and pauses.I personally prefer ""Underthru"" and ""Racket Club,"" among others. For better solo guitar, find Sonny Sharrock's ""Guitar,"" which, despite overdubs of Sonny, renders a more complete vision."
5,I like this book,"If I was going to visit a WW2 AAF vet and wanted something to get him talking, this is the book I would bring. If he was an 8th AAF I know I would never get it out of his hands. It's a really nice book.If I was an AAF vet, this is the book I would buy my kids to show them what the war was like.It's hardcover (not paperback as Amazon says) and is gorgeously laid out with a pile of black and white, and color photos and drawings. It finds a very nice balance between covering various elements and aircraft types, uniforms, and equipment, as well as just plain old day to life of the airmen. It is not a full history of the air war- there are far too many of those already available.Highly recommended to anyone with an interest in this subject. Top notch production values."
2,The sotry was pretty good - it was the rest that bugged me,"Being from the DC area, I may be oversensitive. I thought the storyline was pretty good - although there were quite a few two-dimensional characters. While we get some insight into Lacey, we don't get more than thumbnail skectches of everyone else (including one very confusing passage in which the viewpoint shifts back and forth between several different characters).It would have made a good beach read if not for:-the constant slams about DC cops (although she does get points for correctly referring to them as the Metropolitan PD)-several comments about all DC children being armed with illegal hand guns-and some cultural slurs about cab drivers.So all in all - it took me longer than normal to get through this book since I put it down every time I ran into one of the above. I don't think I'll be reading the rest of the series."
2,Silly,"Lacey Smithsonian, editor of the fashion beat of a local DC paper, is asked by her hairdresser to investigate the death of another hairdresser because she ""knows the nuance of style"" -- even though said death was ruled a suicide by the cops. This has got to be one of the most ridiculous excuses I've ever seen used to get an amateur involved in a case.There's not much to like about the book -- the characters are routine and flat, the dialogue is stilted, the names are silly (Tony Trujillo, Brooke Barton, Polly Parsons). There are plenty of other amateur sleuth series that are much more worth their cover prices."
2,"""Killer Hair"" Just Doesn't Cut It.","This book has a very slow start. I was more than halfway into the book before it started getting exciting. The romance part of the book never really takes off. The character names were just too silly. I was expecting more fashion oriented dialogue than the book delivers. Overall, it was an okay book."
4,Suspense to the final,"What a fun book to read. I felt like I was in the heart of the Washington DC fashion scene. It kept me in suspense to the end as I kept turning pages to discover as I kept reading to figure out the real killer. And surprisingly, I learned about fashion designs along the way. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who knows DC area and wants to feel the beat of the political scene."
2,something just wasn't working for me,"I couldn't quite put my finger on what bothered me about this book, but I wasn't eager to pick it up in the evenings. The story sort of floated around, and then Byerrum wraps it all up in a neat little package in a few pages. The police were painted to be totally incompetent (I live in D.C. and it's not true), and the fashion reviews seemed tacked on and irrelevant. Lead character Smithsonian's ""Crimes of Fashion"" articles were sort of cute. But Smithsonian seemed irritated by almost everyone in her life, and the love interest was a non-starter. It wasn't bad, but I wouldn't go out of my way to read this one. Even though I had the second book in the series, I had no desire to read it and moved on to another book instead."
4,Killer Hair,"Book one in the Crimes of Fashion cozy mystery series. Lacy Smithsonian is a frustrated reporter stuck with a fashion column. She feels she will never be taken seriously as a journalist in Washington. But, when hair stylists start turning up dead, she's suddenly getting serious attention from a sexy ex-cop, fellow reporters, the FBI and a murderer. Killer Hair is a fun cozy mystery with likable characters. I can't wait to read the next book."
2,Maybe not for me.,"I've only started it...but I'm not finding it that interesting. It's very slow for me to get into. I'm 2 chapters in and unfortunately, I'm bored. Maybe I'm not fashionable enough :) The characters just haven't intrigued me at all and I'm a very character driven reader. I like to feel like the characters are people that I know and I just don't relate to the characters at all."
2,Built to Rule; Not to Stay Together,"While the idea of a ""lego"" transformer was a good idea, in practice it is a disaster. The pieces do not stay together and for every stop you follow, you undo the three before. Even when transforming, you have to take it all apart, and then it won't stay or stand as indicated. A very disappointing toy ... glad we found out before the holidays."
5,Simplemente Arjona es el mejor,"Ricardo Arjona es a mi entender el mejor cantautor que existe actualmente. El combina tantos elementos diferentes para escribir cada una de sus canciones, mezcla problemas sociales, culturales, ambientales, amorosos, etc. y lo hace de una forma tan excepcional que no tengo palabras para describir como lo hace. Lo que más me gusta de él es que sus canciones tienen sentido y todos nosotros nos podemos identificar con ellas, ya sea con lo que nos esté pasando a nosotros o a nuestro alrededor. Sus canciones me han ayudado a tener una mejor idea de ciertas cosas que nos pasan en esta vida. La ultima vez que tuve la oportunidad de verlo fue en un concierto que celebró en mi pais, República Dominicana, en el cual él estuvo fenomenal, soberbio, es más, para que seguir hablando de su actuacion si yo se que no voy a encontrar una palabra que pueda definirla perfectamente. Pues asi me despido y espero que Arjona pueda seguir cosechando exitos como lo ha hecho hasta ahora."
5,Excelente produccion discografica,Si usted es fanatico del estilo de musica de Ricardo Arjona compre este disco ya!. Sus temas sobre la mujer y sus ya famosas situaciones de la vida cotidiana hacen de este disco otra excelente produccion.
3,COMO ARJONA NO HAY OTRO,"ERE MI ARTISTA FAVORITO POR QUE CADA LETRA TUYA ES UNA VIVENCIA QUE COTIDIANAMENTE SUCEDE. ES MAS LA UNICA VERDAD QUE PASA ES COMO TU LO DICES: QUE NO HAY MAL QUE DURE CIEN AÑOS POR QUE REALMENTE NO ESTAMOS SOLOS, LA VIDA SIGUE POR DELANTE Y EN UNA DE ESAS QUIZAS NOS ENCONTREMOS CON UNA MUJER QUE AL NO PODER HACER ALGO SEAMOS NOSOTROS QUIEN LO SOLUCIONEMOS Y QUE SIEMPRE HAY UN DIA BUENO PARA EMPEZAR CANCELAR TODO Y REORGANIZAR Y BUSCARSE UNA NOVIA PARA YA NO SER LA MISMA PULGA QUE VA DE CAMA EN CAMA BUSCANDO ALGO MEJOR. SIEMPRE TE APOYARE."
1,"Horrible, horrible, horrible!","This movie is a real stinker! The ""medical students"" are in their 30's (the lead actor is 42 years old playing a college aged kid...oh, please!), the acting is stiff, and they find humor in making fun of the token fat kids...watch them stuff their faces with a wheelbarrow full of hot dogs and dancing wildly. And, to make matters worse, they don't use a stunt snake, and smash the heck out of a rattlesnake! Truly the stuff that nightmares are made of. If you really must watch this movie, watch the Mystery Science Theater 3000 version. At least Joel, Crow, and Tom Servo are fun. The rest is not worth the time."
1,But... Watch Mystery Science Theater's version,"This movie is everything the other reviewers have said. Slow, boring, no terror - horrid acting and horrid writing. But, as terrible as this movie is in its original format - I have to say the crew of Mystery Science Theater 3000 really upped it's potential. I've even watched it a second time, knowing their jokes and finding it even better than the first time. My BF and I still crack the one liners from time to time. So - ignore this version - stream/rent/buy the MST3K version. And hat's off to the very best actor of the movie - Yuma (or Huma - sp is unknown) the cat. =-)"
5,MUST READ,This is a MUST READ book for anyone interested in the Baal Shem Tov and Chassidism. Beautifully edited!
5,Good book by a good man,I know Dovid Siers personally and in him you'll find the case when the author lives every bit of his wrighting in deeds and spirit. Thanx G-d
4,Good product,This is a good book. It starts with proving things for measures on the reals and then generalizes to measure spaces.
4,An excellent choice,"This is the book we used when I was a grad student. This is indeed quite a nicely written book: logical progression of concepts, a large number of exercises of varying difficulty (hard ones have hints) and no typos (always a big plus with me). All the classical results are included. My only suggestions to make this book better would be to have some longer discussions of the concepts introduced to break the litany of definition-theorem-proofs and to include historical notes. This would make this book a little bit less dry and an even more enjoyable read. Nevertheless, this is one of the best books on the subjects, better than the book by Royden which is also used by some professors."
5,One of the best real analysis books,"For the past two semesters, our professor used this book as textbook. I didn't buy this book during that time. But when I was preparing for the final exam, I borrowed the book from library, and found it was really well-written. Basic materials are well organized and explained. Some profound and important topics are also covered, like Hardy-Littlewood max function; these materials are also explained in a clear and easy-to-follow way. Thus I decided to buy this book to prepare for my Real Analysis prelim and as future reference."
4,A good textbook for new learners,This book uses both classical and abstract approaches to introduce Lebesgue measure and integral. It starts with the classical approach and bases its presentation on Euclidean space. This makes it easier for new learners like me since it is more intuitive. In later chapters an abstract approach is also used. I find this repetition natural and helpful. This book has almost no typo. Its exercises are reasonably challenging.It could be improved in page layout if the end of each proof is clearly indicated.
3,"Hard to follow, but complete","I will preface this review by saying that I am a geophysicist, not a mathematician. I purchased this book as the textbook for a ""Real and Abstract Analysis"" class. The treatment of the subject material is complete and concise. However, I think it's too concise for someone who hasn't been trained to think in the manner of a mathematician. I do keep the book and reference it occasionally though, and the material has improved my understanding of statistics and numerical optimisation."
3,a good book for first-year graduate students in analysis,"In general I liked this book and thought it had many good problems to learn analysis from. One aspect I did not like is the authors exclusive use of R^n as the underlying space. The proofs would have been alot nicer had they introduced the concept of a sigma algebra over a set. Also, I thought the authors should have provided more information on transforms,since they are very important in engineering. A better book is Rudin's ""Real and Complex Analysis"""
2,Not the extended edition I hoped to have just the basic theatricle release,"I have been awaiting the blu-ray edition of the wrath of kahn for some time now and they put it out in this affordable 3 movie set along with trek 3 and 4. I happily popped it in and although the sound and picture quality were fantastic, the added scenes from the last dvd release were missing once again. Clearly yet another example of paramount wanting to soak the fans for as much as they can. It was bad enough asking for well over $100 a season full retail for the different series when most other non trek seasonal series went for around $40-$60, they also like to sell the same fan as many copies as they can by adding a little more each time. So they have all the footage why not put out the complete extended movies with all the 2nd disc goodies...oh yea, they are currupt tribble farmers soaking us for all they can."
4,Star Trek Trilogy Blue Ray,"These are old favorites that I haven't seen in years (and then on Beta-Max!) Both audio and video are very good. As others have noted, the remaster of TWOK is fantastic. If you're a fan, you can't go wrong with these."
3,I'm on the fence about this release,"What's good about it: contains the 3 best ""Trek"" films that feature the original cast. The picture is slightly better than the 2-disc DVDs of these films, which looked great. The Dolby Digital EX sound is a nice improvement over the previous releases.What's bad about it: Wrath of Khan is the theatrical cut, whereas the 2-disc DVD was the Director's Cut. NONE of the incredible bonus features from the 2-disc releases are included with this set, and the all-new features are mostly a bust. The visual effects featurette in this set is a real letdown, as it covers the first 6 movies in 13 minutes, so there is no time for any great detail on the FX work.Bottom line: The transfers, both video and audio, are as good as DVD gets. If that's what you are after, or if you don't have the out of print 2-disc releases, this should do fine."
3,star trek trilogy,Got a blue ray that diddn't want- immediate credit was given because no regular dvds in stock.
2,Can you say sloooowwwwwww.,"I remember standing in line the first night this movie came to the theater. It was so wonderful to see my old ""Star Trek"" heros. The story is even pretty good but half the movie could be cut out and it would be great."
2,Please explain this product to me,"I don't get it. Why would I just buy this Blu Ray trilogy of Trek movies when I can buy the Blu Ray set that contains all 6 original movies?? I guess because this trilogy is less expensive. But I mean if you're going to spend on the trilogy, just get the whole 6 movie package. Am I missing something?"
1,"Another predictable, pointless Paramount release","Another half a55sed bogus release, preying on loyal fan's desire to collect all things Star Trek.Let see how many other ""editions"" Paramount can think of:Nicholas Meyer editions (ST2 + ST6)Leonard Nimoy editions (ST3+ST4)The Saavik trilogy (ST2+ST3+ST4)Spock Messiah trilogy (ST1+ST2+ST3)Come on Paramount.....I dare ya!"
1,TRILOGY TRASH FROM PARAMOUNT,"Hello Amazoner's & Trekker's!Well, this is yet another pathetic attempt from Paramount to cash in on your hard earned money. Whoever buys this ridiculous Trilogy should be ashamed of themselves. Why would you buy this when it does not include all The Original Series Star Trek movies. I think it is boycott time. Just think, if we all stopped purchasing trash like this, maybe, just maybe, it would send a message to Paramount to do the right thing for people who love Star Trek. DO NOT BUY THIS TRILOGY TRASH. PLEASE!!!"
1,Horrible grainy picture,"Paramount should be excoriated for shooting these films with grainy, substandard processing.Awful.The Blu Rays enhance the terrible video. It is almost like VHS tape.Beyond comprehension. Stick with DVD. These only make bad worse!"
5,The science fiction series that will live forever.,"This is a great series. These 3 movies were fantastic when they first came to the theaters, and the entire series is still tops in my book. The new Star Trek movie is great, too. I am looking forward to the next installment."
3,about a girl...,"This is one of those books that would appeal to both teenagers and adults. Thumbelina has a silly name and long blonde hair. Her less-than-perfect mother dies unexpectedly, and after she goes to a foster home, she teams up with another sassy youngster, a girl named Myrna who has orange curls. Together, they try to make it out in the world. This is a sad novel that draws you in until the last page. Though the lack of quotation marks and the slow plot development make the novel a little clunky at times, Thumbelina and Myrna are such fascinating characters that it doesn't matter."
5,An amazing book,"I've actually read this book twice, which is rare for me. But it's such a deeply touching story and it just breaks your heart once you begin identifying with the main character. But Thumbalina isn't one who walks around wanting you to feel sorry for her, so on some level although it's a sad story, you also hone into her strength which ends up being the one thing that makes this sad story inspiring."
4,Original and intriguing story. Anxiously await a new work!,I read about this book in the New York Times Book Review and simply had to read it. It did not disappoint!
5,One of the best suspense novels I've read!,"Combining supernatural abilities with a murder mystery, medical research, relationships and even a little romance, Barret Schumacher has written a page-turning, can't-put-it-down novel! I have only read a few novels that keep my interest and excitement long after the last page, and this has been added to the list. I think I will add it to the top of my favorite discoveries, right up there with Katherine Neville! I highly recommend the book."
5,How is it possible to score anything less than five stars?,"This recording is a tour de force - that's the only words to describe it. I admit that I am an avid fan of Stephen Hough and his virtuosic yet musical (two terms not always found together) interpretations.In this case he takes the magnificent Fifth Sonata in F Minor (my favorite) and delivers with a ""Brahmsian"" touch. In many hands this has been heavy and even dull, but Hough keeps the focus on the melodies, perfect phrasing. As much as I enjoyed the sonata, the Ballades were even better (if possible). The dreamlike state sometimes associated with Brahms's piano works has never been realized as it is in this recording. This is a definitive CD for any collection."
2,Dissapointing,"Don't think for one minute that this is in the same class as Seabiscuit or Colt, both thoroughly entertaining and informative books. Too many totally irelevent references to the dominant female and sometimes quite difficult to follow the chronology of the pedigrees. Informative to some extent, but then, what would you expect from a thoroughly immodest genius breeder."
1,Ego + Ego+ More Ego= Don't waste your money.,"As an avid fan of the sport of horse racing and owner of several race horses I purchased ""Horse of a Different Color"" eager to glean from it's pages the 'secret' of one who had attained the improbable. Winning the Kentucky Derby is something we all dream about.Unfortunately, this boorish narrative begins with and maintains the overwhelming self-aggrandizement found in too many people involved in the sport of racing. Upon reaching page 175 I put the book back on my book shelf and have no plans to re-open it.What could have been a wonderful story about an unlikely champion was, in fact, one man's story about what is clearly his favorite subject: himself. With so many other wonderful books available on the champions of horse racing I would recommend passing on this one to take a chance on any other."
5,Entertaining,Jim Squires writing style keeps you reading on. A good look at the inside of Ky. horse society. I highly recommend this book to anyone that watches the Derby!
3,Please end!,"While reading the book I really struggled to stay interested in the story line. I was finding nuggets of information in the thoroughbred industry that sparked my interest, and when I ponder back on what I learned I would give the book rave reviews because it did capture a lot of detail that could easily be skipped over. But there was a lot of the story line that had me wishing the book would end early."
4,In the Winner's Circle!,"Jim Squires' former editorial background serves him well in this well-written, witty, informative book about the high stakes horse breeding world. It's nice to know that an ""outsider"" who really knows little about breeding race horses was able to produce a grade I stakes winner who won last year's Kentucky Derby. Even if you aren't familiar with the horse world, Squires is able to entertain the reader with his tongue-in-cheek style and his own view of the Kentucky horse breeding world. This book, like its famous horse, is a winner."
2,"More Horse, Less Author","""Horse of a Different Color"" shines when it shines the spotlight on Monarchos, winner of the 2000 Kentucky Derby. It sinks when the author looks at himself.Somewhere along the line, an Editor should have warned the author against using a second person narrative style. It just gets annoying after a while. And his dubbing of his wife as ""The Dominant Female"" is kind of cute at first, but after 300 pages it really grates on the nerves.Cutesy writing has no place in a book for adults."
2,Not that good,You cant move the toys legs. You can move its arms but its not shaped as a punch. It looks like if the toy is pointing at something. I rate it a 2 because you can remove its head and put anoter scary cool snake face in it. I think they have a pic in this site or something. Idk.
4,It you are a Mint Condition Fan GET THIS ONE!!,"Mint Condition brings the flavor with this compilation of their old and new songs. Some stay the same while other have changed, you still can flow with their funky, jazzy sounds and beats. If you are a Mint Fan GET THIS ONE. I spent my last fifteen dollars buying this one and It was worth it."
5,"Such a ""Minty"" flavor","These guys are just what they call one big pot of ""Gumbo"". They have combined the ""hot and spicy"" flavorings from the 1st cd ""Meant To Be Mint"" mixed with some slow simmerings from the ""Mint Factory"" cd. To add a little bit of homestyle cooking they put in the stylings from ""Definition of A Band"" . If your not to full from the main course you can sample some new dishes like ""Deep in My Pockets"" and ""What You Bring To The Party"". Some of the original recipes have added some new spices like ""Pretty Brown Eyes"" tear drop edit and ""Let Me Be The One"" ummah radio remix...In addition as usual Stokleys voice melts in me like an after dinner ""Mint"" Try some today for yourself."
5,All of your favorites,This CD is great! All of your favorites are here and it brought back so many memories. I love Mint Condition and I would buy this again and again.
4,Nice overview of one of the great contemporary soul vocal groups,"Purveyors of some of the most solidly robust soul of the 90s, due in large part to REAL instruments and a strong sense of musicianship between the group members, Mint Condition has made several fine albums, but if you're looking to get most of the group's best for cheap, this is a good place to start. All of their signature smoldering love ballads are here, such as ""Breakin' My Heart (Pretty Brown Eyes),"" ""U Send Me Swingin',"" ""Someone To Love,"" and ""What Kind Of Man Would I Be"" along with a couple of new (at the time), hip-hop flavored songs that are nonetheless still tasteful and well done despite breaking away from the group's signature sound. The collection gets four stars instead of five because many of the songs are edits (a possible attempt to squeeze as many songs as possible onto a single disc), but the songs themselves stand as some of the nicest sounding soul of the period."
3,"answer for Benny ""999 classic""","If I am not mistaken, the cut you spoke of ""you're all I need"" is actually a verse from the song; ""make me say it again girl,"" by the Isley Bros. It is available on the CD entitled: ""The Heat Is On."" You do not have an email address listed so I had to put the answer in the review section. Hope this was helpful."
4,Sent me Swinging,"Mint Conditons songs-old and new- make me melt. They remind me what love is. I love that ""Pretty Brown Eyes"" remind me that I am beautiful and I don't have to be 'blond and blued eyed' to be that. My teenage years were made up of romantic ballads from this album. If you want a trip down memory lane, this is a great drive."
1,Can't play on my computer!!!,"Would be nice if my computer could accept it, but Micro has made it so difficult to install, I can't enjoy it!!!!"
1,Wrong disks,I got this game 6 days after i ordered it but when i opened the case the wrong disk was in it it had Gears of war for Xbox 360 i was pretty up set and still cant figure out how that game got in this case. Wasted my money and time
1,Total trash.,I have a 2.16GHz dual core machine with 2GB of ram and a Ati x1600. With the lowest settings I get maybe 10fps. With Flight Sim 2004 I get 60fps at the MAX settings. With the lowest settings FSX looks HORIBALE and unacceptable compared to 2004. FSX is a step backwards compared to 2004. I'm going to stick to X-Plane from now on. X-Plane gets faster with each new release. I've been a Flight Simulator fan since Flight Sim version 5 that cam on two floppy disks.
3,For Serious Inquiries Only,"My brother in law (I bought this as a gift for him) had all of the required programs that were listed by the product, but his computer still had trouble running it. He had to get upgrades on his computer before he could play it effectively. It's apparently pretty realistic and fun once you get it to work. I wouldn't suggest it for someone who isn't serious about wanting to play it though."
1,MFS X is not as advertised,"The Microsoft FS X does not work as advertised. My computer exceeds the required specifications of a computer yet this barely runs. The scenery is not as good, it is unreliable, takes too long to load and is inflexible. Who needs all those cities!! Frankly, I wish I could get my money back. FS 2002 was much better."
3,serious simulator,"I am taking flying lessons in a Cessna 172, and this simulator is on spot to practice procedures---aka fly by the numbers (which I learned is very important). However, using a joystick and keyboard is not the same as the real cockpit of course, and the details are not nearly as breathtaking in a real plane."
2,Unprofessional,The graphics are average. The actual flying in unrealistic. No airplane that I have found in this program will capture the localizer or glideslope on an ILS flight. The switching back and forth between approach and center then back to approach and so on and so on is not how it happens in real life. Although this version boasts some new airplanes it took away a few of the good ones like the Cessna 182. This program needs some work from a real pilot and air traffic controller if it is ever to be realistic.
5,Best Flight Game Ever,"This game makes you take total control of the plane.You are the pilot,captain of the plane.You fly the plane where ever you want to.Truly i love this game.Check it out"
1,you cannot go wrong with a purchase like this,"Flight Simulator is one of the best DVD money can buy, because the whole game is so live you think you are realy part of it."
1,stay with xplane if you have it dont waist your money you would have to spend more,to experienced pilots who want to upgrade to a new flight simulator. Dont use this. There is not much planes unlike other fs games i have used. To people who have xplane stick with it. And also This game requires lots of upgrading to your pc. I have a custom so im fine. But stick with xplane.
2,Dissatisfaction,"I purchased the new Microsoft FSX Deluxe and was very dissatisfied with its performance. It's not the cost of the item, but it's in the two year wait until it became available, the over $1000.00 upgrades to my computer in anticipation of the release of FSX. I have a 3.2 processor, 2GB's of RAM and a 512MB high end graphics card, a 21 inch flat screen monitor which makes my computer over three times the recommended operating levels. When ever I'm flying if I get any where near a populated area the frame rates drop considerably and will even cause the plane to stop in mid-air. Microsoft should do something to remedy these problems. They should feel some obligation to their customers."
1,What a bust...,"Gameplay-wise, the addition to detail in cities was thrilling, and the very few new planes to try held my attention for a few minutes......but at 3GHZ, 1GB RAM and a brand new $200 NVIDIA Graphics card, this game runs HORRIBLY on even the lowest graphics settings. It is very disappointing that this game seems like it was designed only to work on supercomputers. Save your $70 unless you plan on forking out another $1000 to retrofit your system to play this game."
1,Excellent release but major disapointment at the same time,"If you don't have Intel Core 2 Duo processor with a very decent graphic card in your machine, don't even bother to buy it. On my AMD Athlon 3800, 2Gb memory and Nvidia 5800 512Mb runs at about 14 - 18 frames per second with scenery, dynamic scenery and 2D panel set to minimum. The minimum system requirements on the box are waaaaay off.But if you do have a Core 2 Duo machine, go ahead - it looks awsome."
3,Great Graphics = Great Lag,The minimum requirements on the back of the game barely make anything enjoyable. You need a very high performance computer to get just a normal setting out of this game. I'm going back to Flight Simulator 2004 just because I can get better scenery and performance than this one.
1,You'll spend a lot more than $70 if you buy this game,"This game does not run with the recommended system requirements listed on the box. I have an Athlon X2 64 4600+ with 4gigs or RAM, SATA HD, and an Nvidia 7900 GT and even on the LOW settings the game chugs along at 30 FPS or less.I can only imagine how much money one would need to spend to upgrade a computer that is capable of running this game on the higher settings. I play most of the latest games on my system at 1680x1050 resolutions at the highest graphics settings and 4x AA and they run at over 60 FPS without any hickups.This game looks worse than the oldest Playstation 2 games, which when comparing the hardware is like comparing a bicycle to the space shuttle.Save your money, buy something else with the $70, for all this is good for is providing a good training tool for anger management."
2,There is nothing more useless....,"You can fill a game with new features, make it bigger and better than previous versions...but here is the bottom line: there is nothing more useless than a game that won't run on your computer. Microsoft has tried hard to make Flight Simulator accessible to the average gamer, they've included much in this version to help people learn how to fly. But while the game has incredible potential, it becomes useless to most people because it simply cannot be played fluidly on even a high-end computer system. I have no idea what Microsoft was thinking on this one; why make a game that very few people will be able to enjoy? This will inevitably lead to reduced sales and customer dissatisfaction, big time. I'm sure FSX is an incredible game, ""in theory,"" too bad most of us can't play it. Such a shame, this game is simply ahead of its time. If you are running FS 9 (Flight Simulator 2004) I suggest you stick with that and wait for computing technology to catch up to this game."
1,Might as well have thrown the $64.99 + into the gutter..,"I have purchased all versions of Microsofts Flight Simuator and really enjoyed all of them. That is, until now. I get the feeling that this was originally designed for Their X- Box game and then then made a lousy effort to open the pc market. The giggest disappointment for me was landing without seeing the airport or close the cocKpit view and land with no instruments. You can not adjust the eye point up or down if the instrument panel is open. TO SUMMERIZE, SAVE YOUR MONEY AND TAKE YOUR SIGNIFICANT OTHER TO A NICE DINNER. YOU'LL BE MORE SATISAFIED WITH THE MONEY SPENT."
2,Operating problems,Had problems properly operating this game. Was informed by the maker of my graphics card (ATI) that the new Simulator X is not compatible with their graphics cards and will not operate properly. As a result I was able to return the product back to Amazon which I greatly appreciated their consideration of providing a refund. Amazon contiues to be the best in providing total customer satisfaction.
4,Limitless (seemingly) potential...,"This is by far the most graphics and processing hardware intensive flight sim yet from Microsoft (or any other small PC brand). If I had a fast enough system I'd be losing sleep with this simulator, but without a new gaming box with dual video cards (SLI) and quad core processor you're just going to get pissed off at how you can't raise the graphics settings to an acceptable level.. This is an awesome simulator that was built for hardware not available to most users ---- in short: get a custom game system built or wait until such time you're ready to do so..."
1,Returning It Unopened,"Thank you for all your comments. I am taking my copy of FSDeluxe back, unopened. I am greatful you all saved me the frustration and anger. Sorry you all endured it though. The hardware requirements for new software is getting crazy."
2,"Should take ""simulator"" out of the name","The game is very pretty so if that's what you like (and have the hardware to run it) it can be fun. Calling it a ""flight simulator"" is a joke. The flight model is not in same realm as true simulators such as x-plane."
2,extremerecluse,"I have not purchased this game yet. I want to know if it will work on my system. I have a dual core, quad 6.6 processor, 4GB RAM, and a 8800 GT video card. I will not make the purchase until somebody can tell me if this machine I built will allow it to run without hickups."
1,Big disapointment.......,"First of all I had high expectations of this game from the fab screen shots i saw prior to purchasing this game. after an agonising load almost 2 hours I finally got going. Now my system is fairly modern with 3.4 ghz pentium 4 with 128 mb of vram and a 120 gig with 5400 rpm hd its no push over, so I tried to be conservative by lowering the sliders to medium man was I shocked at how slow everything loaded. It took almost 5-7 seconds for a camera view change to take place and everytime I wanted to fly it takes almost 7-8 mins to load. The biggest disapointmet was the virtual cockpit which is really mushy and poorly setup, flying in 2d cockpit mode is virtually the same in fs04 but with out the terrible load delays. scenery is poor and plane selection is also poor. I think il have to wait another 5 years before I get any real enjoyment out of this game. Right now it only gives me a headache.."
1,buggy & little to no tech support,"FSX not ready for prime time a total disappointment quite frankly being a fan of fs2004 i bought fsx with high hopes of being able to at least install and run the product on my brand new vista machine.one bug that no pc magazine will EVER tell you that all the forums will is the ""FSX Activation Error"" do a google search see what i mean there are LEGIONS of users just like me left out in the cold with no solution to our problem from tech support or knowledge base articles. after installing fsx asks you to activate it you enter the reg code and it gives you an error message to reinstall (both online and phone activation options) and it loads fsx after which you can only run it for an 1/2 hour. dont buy this product after bouncing around tech support and no bug patches or fixes im stuck with a turkey. giving this program a star is too much its not worth it stick with fs2004 or flight simulator x."
4,Too many requirements,"As some other user said, Flight Simulator X needs a strong machine to run properly and efficiently. I've been playing Flight Simulator for 2 years so, because of this, I know how it is supposed to be...Right now, I haven't bought my Flight Sim X but I have been playing this week in my friend's house in his Brand New Computer that he bought exclusively for Flight Sim.He has 512MB of Ram, a 256MB ATI Video Card, a 120GB Hard Disk, and a 3.00GHZ Intel Pentium.I was surprised when I found out that flight sim was not running properly in this computer. It was stopping and took a long time loading. With this I mean, that microsoft, even though they successfully created a great simulator, should try and modify this Sim so computer's that cannot have those Great Specifications required can run properly. Try to make it more available for people that cannot afford those kind of specifications.I hope you get my point and that microsoft consider this Review."
