4,GBA SP Rocks!,"The GBA SP Rules. The only problems I have are1) After getting used to the GB Color unit I had, I keep thinking I'm pressing the buttons too hard (like I would on a GBC,) so I try adjusting what I'm doing.2) I still have a lot of GBC games, and the stick out of the front. It's really ANNOYING.BTW, The SP units still use a battery. It's screwed in to the back. It recharges on the wall, of course. Where else would the power go?"
4,AWESOME GAME SYSTEM- A MUST HAVE!,"The GBASP is one of the best handhelds ever. There are many ifs but I assure you its probably the console for you!The backlit screen is just like the light on a digital watch. Only for the entire screen!the GBA SP comes in Cobalt and Platinum, which is the most preferred color. Many stores are sold out, but Toysrus is the only store I've found with GBA SP platinum in stock!As for hand size, I' can tell you I have big hands, and for the GBC people this is a console thats easy to adjust too. Usually it wont be a problem. The flip-open desing is cool too.SO WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR? BUY THE GBA SP!"
5,GBA SP Rules,If you want to buy somting for you or your childeren you gotta buy the Gamboy Advance SP since it has a built in lited screen(wich the gameboyadvance did't have)you can play in the day and night you dont need to buy batteries for it since it has a rechareble battery included just plug it in the car walsocet or ps2 you can take it anywhere. I think that it's the best thing you could buy. By the way it's very smal and it weighs only five ounces.
2,BLOWS!!,"I cant believe NINTENDO even released this halfA$$ gameboy! There are alot of things they should have improved on but didnt. Sure the case is nice and functional and all but thats where the improvments end. First, the battery cant be accessed so what happenes when it dies??? Do I have to pay NINTENDO to get a new one put in? Also the headphone jack is missing??! How can you put out a gameboy and not have a headphone jack?! This means I have to buy yet ANOTHER device to make my gameboy function properly. NINTENDO should have waited till they were ready to release a gameboy with N64 quality hardware before putting out another rehashed version of the same product!"
4,THIS IS THE BEST GAME BOY EVER!!!,"I was surfing around Nintendo looking for stuff from Golden Sun 2. I said to myself, ""Why not check the GBA page while i'm at it?"". It was there. All over the top of the page. Questions kept flashing through my mind. What did they improve? Even if nothing but physical appearance changed i'd still buy it. Poor light? No problem. Choped up screen? No more. Battery runs out? Hey, you've got 10-18 hours of continuous play, so do you REALY care anymore? NO!!! BUY IT!!! It's just that good."
2,Waste of money!!!!!!!!!,"I got a GBA from my friend for half the price elsewhere, but I found out it was a waste of money because: One, this is only a small portable, so there is HORRIBLE GRAPHICS THAT MAKE YOU WANT TO BURN IT! Another thing is that is bad is THE HORRIBLE SOUND THAT MAKES YOU PUT IT ON MUTE!Uhh. There is also, in almost every game, a HUGE AMOUNT OF DIFFICULTY BECAUSE THE SCREEN IS SO SMALL! Another bad thing is THE SCREEN IS SO SMALL THAT AFTER 20 MINUTES YOU GET A HEADACHE AND NEED GLASSES! So, all in all, this is a horrible thing to waste your money on. (PS: Wait till the PSP, which has 2x the power of a PS2!!! It's also a portable that looks cool from pictures and from what I can see, has comfortable controls. It also uses DISKS. Coming in March 2005. Or even earlier, the Nintendo DS with 2 screens and a controller! This is a portable also)"
2,Ohh.. another gameboy,"Nintendo continues it's taradition of putting out another gameboy every two years. Umm... yay... Luckilly, THIS time I don't have to buy it to play the newer games. While this might be a good purchase for anyone buying a gameboy advance with a few extra dollars on hand, to a current gameboy advance owner, it should be avoided. And for people that play enough and during the night, the abitlity to recharge batteries could ""pay for itself,"" and the backlight provides a glare-free way to save your gameboy from the dark ages."
1,I'm tired of being [cheated],I just bought a GBA a month ago. I figured when I bought it that I would be able to SEE the game I was playing. Silly me. Now I hear GBA SP is coming out and it has a light. I can't return the GBA I just got back to the store so I'm stuck with an inferior product...
5,"Finally, the game boy we've waited for","First, let me say that this game boy is the same game boy advance in terms of electronics--same chip, same screen, etc. The big differences are the following:1. Lighted screen. Yes, you read that correctly, you can actually now play your gameboy without having a 100 Watt lamp right next to it! It is not true backlighting, but is more than adequate and functions well.2. Rechargeable batteries. Lithium Ion batteries mean that you no longer will spend money on AA's, but rather plug in your gameboy with the included charger.3. Sleek, portable design. I love the new PDA type design, but some may not. I appreciate the folding screen, which is a neat way to prevent scratches and the like.This gameboy may not be for all, especially if you already own an Advance, but it is a great little unit."
2,"Good, but if you have a Game Boy Advance don't bother...","I previsly got a game boy advance for christmas and also (with it) came a set with a rechargable battery pack battery pack, light, and headphones. If the Game Boy Advance is $$$ and the set is $$$ just buy that. It works just fine for me and my aunt save 10 bucks. The SP isnt going to have seperet games for it so why bother? Save 10 bucks and by the Advance and the set."
4,Gameboy Advance SP,Wow! I just received this for my birthday. It is so awesome except for one thing. i dropped it from my poket about 1 ft off the ground and the front is scratched. Otherwise it is very good. The built in light is so cool and so is the rechargable batteries {bye bye durracel :)
4,My opinion on the new GBA SP,It really something good to see Nintendo finally making a Gameboy system that doesnt require any outside ligth for a change. When the Gameboy Color was released the insane need of appropiate ligth became an issue but this new model is really what gamers asked for since its a fold up its the smallest and easiest to carry around and it also protects the screen's delicate layer of plastic because as with all previous portable system scratch the scree enough the games are unplayable.Also the feature of playing with ligth on or off is nice for the times you dont need to much ligth so you can save battery but maybe a regulator for the ligth would have been more useful.
3,Good system for kids...,"I recently purchased this system after hearing a lot of positive feedback about this hand held gaming system. I found the gaming fun and a really smooth gaming experience, however I soon discovered that playing the GBA for more than 10 minutes would give me a literal migraine headache. This has never happened to me before and I have played several systems without ever having this problem. Well, the problem became so extreme that I ended up returning the GBA due to my constant headaches from it. I loved the game play and sleek design of this system though and really don't have any negatives to say about this besides the fact that it gave me the headaches. I found that most young kids can play this for LONG periods of time, but if you are over 20 and considering this please test it out before buying it because if you are like me you might regret spending the money on something that will just cause you chronic head pain. Otherwise, fun system and probably the best portable."
2,holy ****,this system is the greatest thing that has ever hapened to nintendo wen it comees to handhelds. I love the clam shell design becaus after a year of use it is not all scracthed up or scuffed. The built in light is so nice because it is evenly spread out over the screen so you can play in the dark with out having spots of light on the screen. I was gonna get the gba normal but wen i was looking at them i told my mom about the sp and how it has rechargeable batts. and she immediatly said y dont you get and i told her about the price and she said if you get enough money for the regular one ill buy you the sp because i wiull save on batts.. so all in all this product is good for kids and parents. screw gettn gba get sp it rocks!!!! ps its great wen ur grounded. lol
4,Where's the headphone jack?,"I know there's been a lot of reviews gushing about this thing but I have a few issues. First- there's no headphone jack. You have to buy an adapter that fits in the back. This is an added expense and something else to loose. Second- it's great to have the backlighted screen, but I can't say it's as crisp, sharp and bright as I would have hoped. To my eyes, the screen lacks contrast and looks a little washed out. Third- though it's great to have such a small unit, the case is almost a little too small for adult hands to play.Don't get me wrong, this is a great unit if only for the lighted screen. It's just that after reading the rave reviews, I was a little surprised to find some shortcomings. Now, where the heck do I get a headphone jack adapter?"
1,BAD IDEA,defective product and the dealr refuses to send a replacement or refund money. the ring that clips onto your golfbag is nonfunctioning and they are of no help
2,Qucikly thrown together--many errors,"Being a Dillinger fan I could not wait to see this Conspiracy film. Turns out it's only a slipshod bio of the ""Peoples Bank Robber"" of the Depression era. Many mistakes, such as: ""Police autos had V-6 engines compared to Dillingers V-8 in the early 1930's"". (I could have sworn Ford came out with the V-6 in 1974. I know because my first brand new car was a Mustang 2 with a V-6 in 1976.Thats what it's sales gimmick was at the time. Fords new development, The V-6)The conspiracy segment was a joke. Explained nothing. Why they did not interview Robert Nash, a real expert on the Dillinger/James Lawrence cover-up I don't know.A very mediocre documentary. If you know nothing of J.D. then view it for a basic starter. If you have read much about this guy----forget it."
5,McCulloch 11HP 5KW Generator FG5700AK,"Very nice little unit, though used very little thus far. Now that I have a generator, we'll probably never have another power outage <grin>. This unit has plenty of power for emergency household use. It definitely sees a LOAD when my big deep-well water pump kicks on, but handles it just fine.The only con I've seen thus far is that it floods easily. Choke it for one pull only (maybe two if it's REALLY cold). Otherwise it starts easily on the first or second pull.Note that the picture Amazon is showing depicts a slightly more expensive model, with the side-mounted control panel. The one I received is the basic model, with the plugs right in the end of the generator, and no AC power switches. Just fine for my purposes, and the price was better than I've seen anywhere else.Steve Hendrix"
4,It's taking me back,"I am one of the people trapped in old school where lyrical skills and rap music was still without an orchestra. This CD has such a taste of old school and rap at it's best. 'Don't sleep', 'Party right' and 'Beef' is my favorite tunes. If you are new to Hip Hop then this cd is not for you but if you are a old school luver then this is for you."
4,New Age Music with Jazz Roots,"Brian Rolland is a strong, mature guitarist who should have been famous years ago. Dreams of Brazil is his best work yet, blending classical, flamenco, jazz and folk playing into a disc that works equally well as quiet background music, or, for the serious listener, with the headphones up full. The Brazilian themes create a predictable intoxication, like the Berimbau or the bodies of water referenced in several song titles. For me, though, the shining jewel on this disc is ""In a Silent Way,"" which is played beautifully and originally, as though John McLaughlin's work on the Miles Davis version had never been heard.If you are a Jazz listener who likes some New Age, or a New Age listener who likes some Jazz, this CD is one for your collection."
4,"Good product, slow delivery","The belts came as expected, however it took 3 weeks for them to be delivered, which I feel is rather long for such a small product."
2,Much poorer quality than the issue belt!,"It may looks like the real mcCoy. But, it is a cheap, poor substitute for the real thing. It is much shorter, less stiff and made of poorer quality material than the issue belts. It is flimsy, it rolls and comes unhooked easily at the adjustment hook. I suggest anyone really in need of a good pistol belt spend a few dollars more and get a good surplus belt. Also, it is OD and not CAMO as stated in the description.[[ASIN:B00022QF3M Camouflage Pistol Belt - Military Belt / Camo Canvas Belt]"
1,cheaply made not what I wanted,not well made cheap small circumference not adjustable to what was what my needs were trashed itnot what i expected from amazon.
2,Okay but no cigar,This book was okay to pass the time but it was long and dragged out. Tha main character curses a whole lot of people out before three hundred pages later she realizes she needs to grow up and make a change. She was a whiny spoiled brat. I don't want to discourage this author because I believe you have potential. Next time get to the point.
2,"she tries hard, but...","...the story is fairly predictable and the writing itslf could really be tightened up in many places. I think the author has some potential, and should keep trying, but this book is like Terry McMillan lite."
1,Sorry but hold your money..................,"Can't help to wonder. Are the friends of the author writing these five star reviews...I don't want to be mean, but lets get really REAL! This book is very flat and one-dimensional. I would have like to see more dynamics between the characters and it would have helped if the plot and story were more fully developed. Needless to say the book dragged on as the infamous protagonist was completely unlikable, even in the end.I read the entire book. Yes, the whole thing because I was in a book club and if was up for discussion. If your wondering, we all agreed the book was a waste.I would recommend this book only to those who suffer from insomnia and are looking for the best way to fall asleep!"
3,Feelin' Fallin' Out,"Our book club (Readers Anonymous) recently read ""Fallin' Out"" by Delia C and the overall concensus was that we enjoyed it. It was an easy read with life lessons to learn. We all know someone like Tara (the main character) and at times even saw a little bit of ourselves in her. The cherry on top was getting the chance to have Ms. Delia C at our book club's meeting. She was open to all of our critiques and suggestions for the next book. We look forward to reading that one. Best of luck Delia!"
3,GOING WAY BACK,"WE GOING WAY BACK.BACK IN TO TIME.WHERE MCS NEED SKILLS TO BE CALLED THE BEST,OR TO BE LIKED.THE YOUNGER LISTENERS WOULD NOT UNDERSTAND U.T.F.O. UNLESS THEY HAVE A OLDER BROTHER WHO WAS DOWN BACK IN THE DAY.FROM ROXANNE,ROXANNE TO THE LEADER OF THE PACK,THIS ALBUM IS TRUELY WHAT IS CALLED CLASSIC.SO,MAYBE YOU MIGHT HAVE TO BE PUSHING 30 TO GET DOWN AND ENJOY THIS ALBUM.OLD SCHOOL STILL LIVES."
4,Excellent source for design ideas and stylistic details,"I am a woodworker by hobby and would like to incorporate design elements from 15th-through-17th century French furniture into my projects. This book is a great source for ideas as well as actual details were I to try a reproduction. The proportions, designs, and dimensions are clearly depicted. The pictures are black and white which is why I'm only giving it four stars."
4,Good Value,"Very filling. Plenty of natural roughage here. Not the most flavorful of muesli, but very good value for the money."
5,Great product-better cereal package would be an improvement,"I have mentioned in previous reviews that a better packaging material for this cereal would be an improvement, particularly in regards to retaining freshness longer. For example, the kind of packaging material that the Total brand cereal uses would be my suggestion and recommendation. Thank you for letting me comment. Best regards, Brian"
5,Very good cereal,I purchased this on special and am very happy with the cereal. Typically I heat it with some milk for 10 mins or so... put a little butter and either brown sugar or maple syrup and it is a tastey beakfast. 5 stars from me!
4,An acquired taste,"Originally I hated this cereal becaused it tasted so bland and powdery when hot or cold. However, after eating it three times, I have strangely learned to love it and now I've been eating it for one month.So this was an acquired taste for me that I will definitely order again when I get tired of my steel cut oatmeal. If you are not use to eating healthy foods, however, you might dislike this cereal and never acquire a taste for it."
4,Bob's Red Mill Old Country Style Muesli,"One of the reasons I like this product is there are no added sweeteners - just whole grains,nuts and fruit. I add additional sunflower seeds, ground flax seed,oat bran and milk to the muesli and heat it in the microwave for a minute or two. I then add a spoonful of yogurt (usually the fruit flavored type) for a nice, easy breakfast cereal."
5,Superior cereal,"This is a great Muesli. Compare the ingredients and lack of sugar to what is on the store shelves in boxes. The Amazon price is outstanding. Here is our secret recipe: cook in just enough water to soften, stir in heavy cream, add a little honey. It is filling and is a good glycemic index source of complex carbs (and fiber)."
1,"Tastes like cardboard, yuck!!","I bought this product based on all the 5 star reviews. I really wanted to like it. First I had it with cold milk. Yuck, it tasted like cardboard. Then I tried it warmed up like oatmeal & added brown sugar. Still tastes like cardboard. How can anything so tasteless be loved by so many people?"
1,worst customer service!,"You only know the soul of a company (or a person for that matter) when something goes WRONG. Well there was a mix up on my order. Unfortunately the woman on the phone was unfriendly, accusing and rude! Wow! How can people run a business like this? How can they think it is okay to talk to someone, much less a customer, with such an attitude? Needless to say I did not receive my order in time for my event. It is time to find a different brand of gluten free flours, any ideas?"
4,10 pounds of healthy breakfast,"This is the real deal. I douse it with unsweetened soy milk, and chew it up prior to my coffee so I'm only half awake at the time. If at least one of my meals is healthy, and more than palatable, good deal.Forget the unsweetened claims, there's plenty of dried fruit. But otherwise, as a low-fat, high fiber, burn-some-calories-chewing food, it does good. I don't soak it long enough, so it is gnarly to chew up, especially when I need to eat fast to catch the bus - an adventure in the morning!Why does the label claim servings are an ounce? That would make these 10 lbs last 160 breakfasts, I'm sure my serving is 4X bigger.If I want something tastier, however, I recommend the granola from Oat Cuisine of Alameda, CA - nicely brown, crunchy, and not too sweet, which can be ordered from their web page."
4,love this stuff,"I became hooked on muesli when I was on a cruise last year. The muesli served on the ship came directly from Switzerland and I believe that it was not as sweet as this. I preferred the less sweet version but this is very good also. It is very chewy and certainly appears to be nutritious based on the list of ingredients. I tried making the chocolate chip muesli cookies by using the recipe printed on the package. They were awful, in my opinion. If you want to eat it as a snack, mix some in yogurt rather than trying the cookie recipe. I definitely recommend this product. It is much better than anything that I've found in the health food stores. I would give it five stars if it were a little less sweet."
5,"Good muesli, good price","Good value at $25 for 4X40 oz. I like this better than most of the products in the traditional supermarkets. Great ingredients. Add Sunsweet prunes you can get at Sams Club very inexpensively, sprinkle on some of the salt-free, anti-oxidant trail-mix-type products you can buy at Trader Joes and you have a great breakfast!"
5,the joys of regularity,"I spent some time recently with a 94 year old man. He's actually quite famous but the main thing on his mind was maintaining a sense of regularity. I'm much younger than he but I sense the importance of maintaining a balanced, high-fiber diet even at my age. This product tastes wonderful and it does the job. Nuff said!"
5,Bob's Red Mill Muesli,"Bob's Red Mill Old Country Style Muesli, 40-Ounce Packages (Pack of 4)I ordered this in bulk to split with a coworker. Great tasting breakfast cereal, or anytime snack. Keeps for weeks on end without opening, or in a tupperware type container. Might keep longer, but I've never found out because I finish off a bag within a few weeks."
4,no options,"Coming back to the states after 10 years in England I was surprised that I could not find any muesli in any of my local supermarkets. So, after trawling through Amazon I came across this product. It's good, but not as good as what I had in the UK. But then, of course, I don't have many options."
5,MUESLI I LOVE YOU!,This is the ONLY breakfast I have every single day. Its absolutely delicious. I hate oatmeal and this is the only thing that I will eat. Its great fiber and keeps you regular!
3,Cheap but you get what you pay for,"I ordered this after the Familia muesli that we've been eating jumped in price, but it is a bit dry, reminiscent of sawdust. Drowned in soy milk and topped with fruit, it's bearable, but I don't exactly jump out of bed excited to eat breakfast. I'm looking into making my own muesli now; it can't be any worse, and it will definitely be cheaper.On a related note, I had shipping problems AGAIN after 14 years of great service from Amazon. The muesli I ordered never showed as being shipped, and I ended up contacting customer service. They apologized and said that they were shipping it out with free 2-day deliver added. That's great, but when it did ship, I was charged $11 more than my original purchase price. A quick call to customer service corrected that, but this is happening with every order now, and yes this was delivered by Lasership in an unmarked car. Sign of the times I guess."
5,Healthy breakfast,"I thought it was an excellent product and plan on ordering it again. A little sooner than I anticipated because some mice got into it. I finally decided t poison the mice, they had gone too far!"
4,"Something real, largely unprocessed",I first encountered muesli abroad years ago and despaired of ever getting it here. This is as close to European quality as we in the US normally get. Periodic automated delivery service is excellent.
4,Quick and fun! Fast paced and entertaining.,"Our neighbors who are very much into board games brought this to our house for a party. It kept 16 people happily entertained---it can be played by teams to move faster than pairs. It reminds me of ""Password""---trying to get someone to guess a word, but the idea of contracting for how many clues it will take in advance is different. We'll be buying our own copy!"
4,Great fun for those wise with words!!,"25 Words or Less is a fun game. Being a college student, it encourages competition while challenging us to expand our vocabulary. You have to use your head, but it's fun!!"
5,Great for Vocabulary,"I am a gifted education teacher and I use this in my elementary classroom as a vocabulary building game. Sometimes I use the words on the cards, sometimes I use my own made up cards with current vocab on them. My students love this game and my family begs me to bring it home over the summer to play. Many of the words/topics are geared toward adults."
3,"Slow, Restricted, and Creative","This word game came out to be hampered by the word restriction when I played. Two players bid down from 25 on how many words it'll take them to get their team to say five specific words. Success gains the card and failure forfeits it to the other team. It was tough to get people to say any words even without the time restriction. Someone would always win the bid at some ludicrous number like 5 just to take the bet, and then not get one word correct. The fact that the number of words is restricted prevented it from being a blurting game like Outburst or Taboo. I would recommend this game for large parties only."
5,Awesome and addictive!!,"Simple concept leads to hours of fun! The game doesn't take hours to play, not by any means, but you'll find it's impossible to stop. Great for large groups. Basically, split up into teams, have a player from each team haggle it out to see who can get their team to guess the words on the card using the least number of clues, then let the games begin. The best part of the game is the bidding war, especially when you have really competitive people bidding. The trick is to know when to put away the pride and stop haggling which is easier said than done. Very challenging and extremely addictive. Just be prepared from the inevitable demands of a rematch!"
4,Fun and challenging,"This game is fun. We have played many different types of games and found this to be different and challenging. The only complaint is that due to the bidding process, some people do not regularly get to participate in giving clues. However, we have enjoyed it much."
2,Lifeless And Boring Most Of The Time.,"This is one of TD's weakest attempts to make a soundtrack. And this one really stands out from the rest with it's repetitive tracks, which to me, feels so lifeless and dull. There isn't really a song on this disc that captures your ears wanting you to hear more. It is sad but true.With this said, there are however a few songs that probably suits well for the kind of film it was/is, but I can't comment on this since I havn't seen it yet. But from what I've heard on this disc I'm not really in awe, and there is nothing that inspires me at all to have a few more listens.Buy it only if you are, like the other reviewer said, a Die-Hard TD fan that simply must have every output by TD no matter what it cost or sound."
2,Another soundtrack,"Well, it's the late '80s and Tangerine Dream are cranking out soundtracks at the rate of about one every 3 weeks (I exaggerate, but you get the idea).This soundtrack lacks any real heart with most of the compositions sounding quite repetitive. The music has an almost '50s feel to it, although some tracks are quite modern and a scant few show traces of a brilliant Tangerine Dream.Overall, this is probably their 2nd weakest soundtrack (Heartbreakers would be their absolute weakest in my opinion). It sounds like the band threw this one together in just a couple of hours and spent another couple of hours recording it.This album is probably one for the die-hard TD fans only."
3,Misleading and Disappointing,"Mrs. Berry and her daughter Mary Bertie are widows. Their story takes place in a 200- year old house. The young widow has gone through a terrible and tragic struggle, the deaths of her family members. The seriousness of this book was - unexpected. The cover has a cute mouse, but the book doesn't. If you like sad books this is the perfect one! The illustrations helped me to enjoy the book a bit. That was the best part of the book. I thought this book would be about a mouse, but I was really disappointed! It wasn't at all like the book ""Look Out for the Elephant"" by Carolyn keen which is about an elephant that helps his masters. Now that is the kind of book I like!"
1,Absolute crap.,Same old idiotic concepts warmed over. I could not finish the book and wish there was a way to get a refund. Total BS.
4,a great addition.. except...,i can now carry more stuff than the bag i have that straps to the back of my seat... the down side is that the attachment arm is not long enough and i have had to move my seat forward to use the basket which means my grandkids cant fit in front with me.... ALSO i had to get a bolt to attach the basket because it did not come with a pin or a bolt to hold it on the scooter accessory attachment arm....
4,excellent,"Outlaw does not quite have the jazz funk punch of Gene McDaniel'sHeadless Heroes of the Apocalypse, a 1971 Nixon America horror masterpiece.Outlaw has a more rural sound, with the funk elements present, but more laid back. The thematic content is basically the same, and the album does still qualify strong as funk, even with slide guitar experiments in a more quiet groove.Excellent and about as close to essential as possible without being so. This used to be on a twofer with Headless Heroes, and if you have that, you want Outlaw"
4,History,"Being a citizen of the 60's, my wife (of 45 years) regarded this ""album"" as her grasp of reality of that time!This Xmas I gave her a CD of this album (we still have the original vinyl),our adult children didn't understand her emotion.We are getting to the end, now, more than ever, we have to strive harder to improve everyones condition!OLD HIPPIES NEVER DIE--Until they do!"
4,Helped,"I was very happy with the results of Candistroy I'm a 31yr female, and used to breakout with pimples constantly. I no longer have breakouts every other day. The only thing I didn't like so much was the garlic taste of the pills."
4,It worked for me!,"After the ravages of doxycycline prescribed for Lyme disease I was left w/ an oral thrush...""issue"". If you've dealt w/ this then you understand just truly how awful it is.I tried pro-biotics, oregano oils, kefir, yogurt,etc all to no lasting avail.Out of desperation & w/ more than a bit of skepticism I purchased Candistroy. Well, it worked!Unfortunately, once I felt relief the chance to eat sweets/sugar overwhelmed me & I experienced what I considered to be yeast over growth. Back to another candistroy regimen after which I more closely monitored my diet for lasting relief of thrush symptoms.Based on my experience, it is effective-looking at the ingredients I don't know how or why. What I do know is the choice given me by my MD was more prescription meds, or IHMO poisons-no, thank you.Candistroy-try it, you've got nothing to lose but yeast!"
3,Not sure if it works,"I couldn't feel a difference, so I don't know if this product works.With other productos of the same brand you can feel the difference, I did not notice anything with this on, so I don't know if it worked."
1,Be cautious,"Believe it or not, I had to be treated for thrush while taking the first half of this product. Tongue felt like someone had run a belt sander over it! Very painful and very disappointing."
3,Not sure it was helpful- Also Contains SOY!,I also didn't realize that it had soy in it! I think you are probably better off using Uni Key's Candida cleanse and Flora Key probiotic.
2,Very strong garlic smell,"Garlic was too strong, I couldn't bring myself to use this product. I could smell the garlic as soon as I opened the bottle."
2,Pills hard to take,"The Candistroy pills have sharp edges that make them difficult to swallow. My husband tried to take them and they got stuck in his throat each time, so he had to stop taking them. I still take them but its uncomfortable to swallow, especially by week 3 when you have to take three at a time."
4,Cahinsaw Sculptor:The art of J. Chester 'Skip' Armstrong,This book is a fine addition to any admirer of contemporary wood sculptor. Sherman offers a unique insight into the thought behinde Skips' carving. A thought provoking book that took me as a chainsaw carver to a new level. Fine pictures of Skips magnificent work and humorous stories of Skips life.The story of how this artist took the focus from the saw to the increadible pieces of art that can begin with the chainsaw. The only thing I would have liked more would be a larger version of this book.
4,Nice Putter,"I had been after a two ball type putter, but just wouldn't spend $150 for an Odyssey or the like. I got this putter as a Christmas gift, went out twice the week after , and definitely saved strokes on my game. Nice feel and balance, can't beat the price."
5,Being A Vietnam Vet & A Biker I found it very interesting & Informative.,Being A Vietnam Vet (67-68) & A Biker I found it very interesting & Informative. The VMV/MC is a great organization to belong to. True Brotherhood & No Bull.P Kerns UDT-11
3,Not Bad for low budget.,"The video goes back and forth, kinda like the book he wrote. It isn't bad, but it is a cheap film."
4,Something is missing..,"Finally is he back with some real Arturo playing, but it feel like somethings missing. This cd do not have the soul of the earlier DanZon and Y El Tren Latino records. But still, a nice recording!!"
5,Pure Cuban Timba,"Thanks Arturo...those who are writting reviews here do not know about current Cuban Music...Timba...well it does not matter because they do not know about music. Your performance is great and every ""Tumbao"" and ""Timba Mambos"" are fantastically arranged. Thanks for introducing the world to the current cuban explosion...Timba!Fantastic Arturo!Edgar Roca.Portland/Santiago de Cuba. Cuba"
3,"Good, but the cover and title are both misleading","I expected more danceable music. Considering the cover art, and the fact that he named it after his new dance club, I never expected so much pure jazz. The first and third tracks are great for dancing, and they do have elements of timba. But after that, it is all jazz with Cuban music elements. And absolutely none of those Cuban elements come from Rumba.Perhaps it should have been called ""Jazz Palace""."
2,Rumba Palace....Not so much,"I have been an Arturo fan since before he came to the US. I was very disappointed with this CD. First, the arraignments are aweful, as if they were thrown togather just to fill the disc, no imagination, each track sounds the same as the next. Second, the CD was overproduced. Third, the CD would put you to sleep, not entice you to dance as Arturo said in an interview. Arturo, you can do better. Try allowing others do the arrainging on some of the tracks for a better variety. Try using actual musicians, rather than laying mutiple tracks of the same musician playing the various tracks. I will still be a loyal fan and buy your next CD, but I was very disappointed in this effort."
4,A great Christian book,"Sanders starts the preface by acknowledging that ""Knowledge is partial and certainty seldom attained."" The very first sentence of the book, however, is ""On a spring morning in about the year 30 CE, three men were executed by the Roman authorities in Judaea."" In other words, like most contemporary biblical scholars, the author begins with the assumption of a historical Jesus, and continues to describe what we can say about him based on those grounds. Altogether there is a great deal of valuable information in the book; however I feel it is an error in research not to begin by questioning the premise."
4,audiobook,you won't be disappointed in this product.. well worth the money.. I would definitely recommend it to anybody.. makes a great gift for book lovers..
2,Missing chapters in the book,"The set was incomplete, what a bummer. I happily listened to one book, and then began the other only to discover, no ending due to a missing tape!"
5,Great to find a replacement for my lost book,Lost my book and needed a replacement...Thanks Amazon for being there when you were needed
1,Feel 3-Wood shaft break,"The Feel Golf 3-wood shaft shattered after only 3 rounds of golf. The Feel Monterey Series shaft literaly came apart about 3 inches below the grip while swinging. I play golf 3-4 time a week, am a 12 handicap, and have never seen a club break like this one did.There is no evidence of stress or cracks, I believe it must be a factory defect in the shaft."
2,Not what I hoped for,"I just returned from a trip to Peru and this was about the worst guide book I have used. It provided very minimal information of the kind a traveler can use (especially for someone accustomed to the Lonely Planet series; the only reason I got this instead of LP was it was a bit newer). The maps are not very complete, the listings are even worse and there is very little info on the sights they list. Don't bother."
3,"Who knew, little Denmark?","This is a decent book, written more like a transcribed documentary (from which it was derived) but the whole story of Danish resistance against a monsterous foe - indeed right under Hitler's nose! - is inspiring. The interviews that form the basis of this book are particularly interesting in that they all clearly demonstrate the veracity of the thesis - that the whole of Denmark stepped in to help their countrymen escape the Final Solution. The book requires only several hours to read but is well worth it."
3,Gets you going.,"Menace to Society is Lizzy Borden's heaviest release. I find it to be a little more aggressive than Love You to Pieces. All ten of the tunes are pretty good. The musicianship and production are tight. The song lyrics are also far from boring. Lizzy has got a voice that's very unique--he can really hit the high notes too. He sings great the whole album. Menace to Society is pure energy from beginning to end. The guitar playing is cool throughout. The song that I like the most is ""Notorious."" ""Terror on the Town"" has a good guitar riff also. I like the drum intro to ""Brass Tactics"" too. Menace to Society is worth a listen."
2,No Bargain Here!,First off the price here is way too high. I got these a lot cheaper elsewhere but I would not recommend them anyway. I followed the directions and spent a month trying to brighten my smile but got NOwhere. I have just started to use Crest Whitestrips Premium Plus and after two days I already see a change. There are a few good things about these pens. They are easy to throw in your purse and there isn't an offensive taste. They are easier to use than the strips and I did not experience any burning or sensitivity. The problem is that they don't whiten so needless to say I will not waste any more time or money on these. If you do decide try them I would encourage you to shop around a little because there are better prices out there. (I got mine from one of those home shopping channels) Good Luck!
5,love,"I drink tons of coffee and tea, both black, and these pens work really well. Quick and easy, I use them on the way to work. Worth a try for anyone."
4,Good product,I read all the reviews before I purchased the product. The product only work IF you have recently already had the bright smile professional done! If your getting this product with out that being done first then you are wasting your money ! I love it I use it once a week or sometimes even less Good product will try the toothpaste and mount wash next
4,Have used Britesmile pens for 2 years now...,Crest white strips may whiten a little better but I had sensitivity issues with the product. Britesmile pens are extremely quick and easy to use. A few applications and I get results that I am happy with... and no pain! Gotta love that!
3,teeth whitener,Have used this product several times. It brightens the teeth when you use it several times a day. You need to constantly use it and it only lightens them so much. Ok product.
5,My World Is Empty is an excellent performance,Many artist have performed My World is empty over the years. This artist finally does justice to the song. The rest of the CD is great. But My World is Empty is fantastic.
5,A refreshing breath of soul and pure voice,"I'm glad to see this CD on the market. I happen to be lucky enough to live in Turley's hometown and have the oppertunity to see him live.This CD is as close as it gets. And thats as good as it gets,anywhere. You will enjoy this one. Thanks, Mike Leffler"
2,Horrible sound quality,"I am not an audiophile. I have never cared to look or pay for the richest sound. I have usually tolerated pretty mediocre sound. Therefore, I think it is worth noting that I find the sound coming out of the iPulse to be intolerable. I hooked up my iPod to it, and I was appalled by the tinny noise that came from it. My $15 clock radio sounds better than the iPulse.Linens and Things was selling this on clearance for $48, so I figured it was worth a try. I'll be returning it.WOW technology, huh? WOW, this is a lousy product."
2,WHY CANT THEY PUT OUT THE ENTIRE SEASON,"im 26 now i remember growing up in the later eighties and early ninties with garfield the x-men and my favorate tmnt i currently have season 5,6,7 complete why are the the first three seasons the best seasons in volumes season for and after are in complete form"
4,Great episodes,"HelloI am really enjoying these releases. Only 1 complaint. There is over 190 episodes to be released. If Lions Gate continue at this rate, it would take about 15 volumes to complete the whole set.Could they not release complete Season boxsets for this show or the releases will just go on forever?But yea loving reliving these episodes.AARON"
5,Fun packaging,"If you like the original ninja turtles, you should add this set of DVD's to your collection. The packaging is very clever."
3,Season 5 of TMNT,"Now we get another season set of the classic Ninja Turtles show, at least now they're keeping to the season sets that should've been in place in the first place. While I'm not a fan of the packaging of this season set of the turtles, although its original but at the same time makes it a little uneasy if you put your DVDs on a shelf. While we got 30 or more episodes from the previous two seasons, this season only had 20 episodes that make up Season 5, but there's only 18 of those episodes featured in this set. I'm wondering if the people behind in putting this show on DVD are being lazy or just not knowing all the episodes that make up season and properly putting all the episodes that make up each of the seasons that they have put on DVD thus far. Overall I give this set, 3 stars out of 5."
2,Season 3 Part 3 of Classic TMNT,"Here we are with may should have been called `Season 3: Volume 3', though it's just called `Volume 5'. This set I would think that they would try to go about trying to make this set the rest of Season 3, but felt that they needed to keep going with the trend of releasing volumes instead of trying to make season sets. For example, Transformers got more of a better releases compared to the treatment that the turtles have been getting thus far and which I would like to know why this treatment has got this far for the 1987 Turtles show. We get the next 12 episodes making up the next batch of the show, while all on one disc, making it hard to try to fit that much information on a disc without having to maybe cut anything out of any of the episodes featured in this set. Overall I give it a 2.5 stars out of 5."
3,Stanley Provides a Great Apologetics book,"How Good is Good Enough? by Andy Stanley is an apologetics book that points to the plan of salvation through Jesus Christ. The book is really short (I read it in less than an hour), but the message of the book is of the upmost importance.Stanley uses his pastor's heart and conversational style to answer objections to the Christian message, and point people to faith in Christ for access to heaven. For those of us who have been Christians for a while, this book doesn't reveal new information. However, Stanley reminds us of the essential beliefs of our faith in a fresh way.For anyone who is questioning the message of Christianity, I would highly recommend this read."
5,what a great tool,this book is great....have given it away to several people hopingto turn their heart toward Jesus. great writing..humorous..clever.my husband & son are both pastors...i am a bible story preacher.we all love and recommend this book.
2,Obvious,"A basic Christian book given to me by an associate after my proclaimed disbelief in Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior. A basic recruiting tool. An easy read that was fairly logical, but made no real original claims. I mean, everything in the first 60 pages could be deducted by any intelligent person. The rest of the book consisted of basic Christian explanations and anecdotes. In then end - just 94 pages to explain John 3:16. Save yourself the time."
1,Yet another........,"Repeating something over and over again does not make it true. I haven't seen any cults that don't believe in the sun or gravity. Real truth is self evident, faith is belief without proof. This book is just another device that people like Mr. Stanley use justify their elitist, bigoted attitudes. If people like this were in charge of what books we had access to there would be slim pickings indeed."
4,good enough refutation of earning entrance into heaven,Summer 2004 Reading List - Mini ReviewAndy Stanley presents a nice easy refutation of the idea that good people go to heaven. The book is at once encouraging and challenging without being preachy or condascending.
4,Great read!,Very well written from a different point of view. I enjoyed it very much. Made me ask new questions which I love!
5,Great to Give away,I purchased these to have on hand to give them away. I have asked people to read it and let me know what they think about it. Some don't want to read it but several have.
4,how good is good enough,"I thought it gave a clear and simple definition of what is the truth, in my opinion of christianity. In this day and age it is difficult with so many belief systems, churches and many cultures. All wanting to be the ones who are the only religion that is accurate. This book helped me to simplify what I already believed. Not so much religion as it is spirituallity."
2,not good enough,"*i received this book free from the publisher in exchange for this review*i wanted to like this book. i actually had planned on recommending it- assuming it would deliver on what it advertised. and for all of the bright spots and clever illustrations, i dont think i can recommend it.though he is seeking to persuade readers to believe the christian answer to ""what type of person goes to heaven"", the content is void of the biblical concept of god's wrath against sin & sinners.he does speak of god's love which is important & necessary, but to completely leave out the consequence of *not* believing the gospel is negligent & dangerous. its as if there is no ""bad news"" if you don't choose what christians call ""good news"". and so because of that, this book's gospel presentation is incomplete and i cannot recommend it."
5,"Great book, excellent for skeptics & everyone else.","This little book is a quick read and very understandable for those who believe that being good will secure entrance into heaven. It's a must-read, and written in such a practical way so the reader can easily grasp difficult concepts."
4,equally insipid and inspired,"I'm caught between loving this album and wanting to skip over many tracks. Liz has a beautiful voice, but often her lyrics seem very trite, although her melodies are, admittedly, fantastic. Among the best tracks are ""girly she,"" ""this is blue,"" and the title track, which has an amazingly addictive chorus, although the rest of the track is a bit onerous. Overall, a fine debut from an artist with a spectacular voice and ear for melody, but whose lyrics are a bit lacking."
3,Not pink :(,"Thought I ordered a pink lanyard and I ended up with a white lanyard. Very sturdy and strong though, well made."
4,Wish it would have stated which one they send!,"I love the lanyard, but they did not say which they were sending which disappointed me.. I wanted one with all pink ribbons but I got one that says ""FIND THE CURE"". Either way it was fine I suppose."
3,functional but not what I ordered,"While the product will serve as a functional lanyard the color scheme is all wrong. The lanyard I received is white and red. The Breast Cancer campaign is white and pink. Red is usually used for heart disease and HIV/AIDS awareness. Also, the printing on the lanyard says Breast Cancer Awareness. Just doesn't click in my head."
1,"Why on Earth is this $10,000?!?!?!?!","Exactly how many lanyards do you get for $10,000?! At least specify -- I would imagine it should be around 10,000 lanyards. This is a ridiculous price and needs to be changed!!!"
1,why,"Why is this almost 10000 dnd aollars????? Thats wayyyyyyyyyyy too much money. for real, gah scary price lol. please fix this."
3,they were ok,I wish there was a way that you could pick yoru style. I got a white one and it got very dirty very fast and I was needing to use it for my name badge at work.
5,Folk Music From Norway,"I bought it on a lark and since then have loaned it out and had to buy a replacement. My Wife and I used it for background music in our wedding. Many of the tunes I haven't heard before, though old, are not the most usual. It contained a great mix of insturments, heavy on the hardanger fiddle, and light on volacals. This I liked as well as the selection of the order the tracks were arranged. Though of high interest to few Americans, I think many others would enjoy this CD based on the pleasantness of the sounds. Try it! CPG"
2,a let down,"The recordings were all right but there were not enough songs. I lived in Norway and I can assure you there were plenty of songs to go around, and wish some of those would have been included as well."
2,REALLY!!! Not Rated because there's nothing to rate!,"Before I start let me first say the editorial did not lie. This was a behind-the-scene at photo shoots. And I did see skin. Beyond that, I did not see $26.00 worth of adult video. For what this DVD offered I spent about $20 more than I should have. Nothing against Viva Video, the video showed 26 photo shoots, it showed what goes on behind-the-scene. My disappointment is more directed towards myself for paying so much for this video. Word to the wise for anyone that reads this, if they are asking more than $10 for this video page back and continue shopping. However, if you value the sight of young women with perking breast with dark areolas and you don't mind spending almost $30 for, this is your video."
4,It is a wonderful story tied in with gardening.,"I bought this book for my mother for Christmas, but I couldn't wait to read it myself after scanning pages before wrapping it."
3,Dull Jester,"I saw another version of this opera a number of years ago in which an English star named Tommy Steele played the jester. I had been enthralled with Joel Grey's superb performance in ""Cabaret"" and expected that he would outshine Steele. Unfortunately this is not the case and I found his performance considerably lacking in comparison. Steele not only was convincing as a jester but also as a rejected lover.As to the rest of the cast I remember little about their performances other than to recall that the earlier production seemed superior in more than one way. (But I suspect the earlier Steele-led production was also cut as it fit on a single video tape and probably was no more than 2 hours as well.)"
2,"The value of logic, or the illogic of value?","This book, by a well-known poser of puzzles, sets out of the order of a thousand logic puzzles in a format loosely styled upon the presentation of Scheherazade, but in a somewhat less entrancing way. The problem with logic is that there is just so much of it about. Perhaps the axiom 'less is more' might have been applied and some judicious excision of the more mechanical or repetitious examples been performed. The jewels are lost amongst the glass beads. Obviously by its nature mathematical logic eschews value judgements, but in the present case this seems to have been taken rather too literally."
1,what kind of animal on the animal slippers,"I tried to order a pair of animal slippers for a holiday gift.However, the website did not show me what kind of animal."
3,'The River's Edge' - Original Movie Soundtrack (Enigma),"Decent soundtrack of the movie that tells the story about a disturbed young man who 'shows off' the body of his girl friend's corpse in an attempt to impress his friends - reportedly based on a true story. Several good rockin' cuts here from Hallow's Eve, Slayer and Agent Orange. Would be good to listen to while out on a road trip."
4,Good stuff,"Grape would be the first flavor I suggest trying, but this is the closest to grape. Forget the stuff you get at a convenience store with the high fructose corn syrup and artificial flavors. This stuff is filled with minerals. Good hydration when you have a headache."
2,"When you change a product, it should be better","Ultima recently changed the wild raspberry flavor to red raspberry. The old one tasted much better to me, the new one tastes a bit like bubblegum and aspartame.I originally chose this brand because they seemed to contain the least amount of sugar, but this new mix (despite saying 0 sugar) contains maltodextrin. It also contains stevia, which isn't a bad thing, but may be contributing to the new fakey flavor.We only use about half a suggested serving, so it dissolves ok."
5,More than a sports drink,"Ultima has been a standard item in my pantry for more than 6 years. I used to weight train and do sprint triathlons on a regular basis, this stuff is simply the best thing for you either before or after training. Can also be used just for regular daily hydration for non athletes as a healthy alternative to Gatorade. A lot of people complain about how hard it is to mix, but that is solved by dissolving the powder in about 1-2 oz. warm water first. One of the best non-advertised uses for this product is as a hangover cure <grin>. After a hard night, drink about 12-16 oz of Ultima before bed, and then first thing when you wake up... right as rain in about an hour."
2,very small container,When I saw 90 servings I thought this was a great deal. It is a very small 13.7 oz container and one very tiny scoop per serving. If you use one scoop you can't even taste the powder. You need to add 3 scoops for taste.
2,cheap not worth it,Not a great stroller. The foam covering the handles rips very easily. The wheels never seem to go straight. The basket underneath is useless if there is a child in it. Save your money and buy a Maclaren.
4,Helps A lot,"As a pyschology student I bought this book in college because it was my intro to psychology class' textbook. How would I know that it would be so easy to follow? It really helped me out when I had to sit up late at night and review for the finals. What else can I say about it, besides it is a great book for anyone who wants to becomes more knowledgeable in the general field of psychology."
1,Out of date,This book is out of date for use this semester. Then I took three weeks to receive. I wanted it expressed. Had I received it sooner I would have known that the book is not relevant for 2012!
1,Worst Purchase Ever,"this person has still not sent my book and its been 3 weeks since ive ordered it, i sent an email asking when the book would be sent and did not get any reply. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER!!!!"
4,Very good,This purchase was very good. i got it in great time and on time. i would definately buy from this seller again.
3,Robert the Advertising Planner,"A good textbook for university students. For pro's, the book lacks a touch of ingeniuity."
3,Bad condition,Well the book is the one I needed but the condition it came in was horrible! The book was folded almost in half and is really hard to get to some pages.
2,"Not bad, but...","It's not new. It's like new.Even though there was ""like new"", but I paied more because I want to buy new book. This is not new."
3,Newer edition better,"This is a nice text. Very understandable, easy on the eyes,colourful. Newer (4th) edition is better though!"
3,International Version Textbook,"This international version textbook was half the price of the US version, while the seller claimed that ""everything"" was the same as US version, I found that the question sections at the end of each chapter had different questions than the US version. All the chapter text was the same but the review questions were different. Assignments came back a bit different as half of my class had the international version of this text. It was a pain to try and get the actual assignment questions from someone in the class with the US version text. But hey, I saved money in the end!"
2,not great,"I'm using this book in my Advertising and Sales Promotion class, and I hardly ever comment on books, but I really did not like this text. I found the information was poorly organized, and (maybe I've been spoiled with great textbooks in the past but) this text seldom differentiates important main points from other less important ones. At times, it also uses two different terms for the same object, which is really confusing to a beginning marketing student.Qualms: poorly organized, poor differentiation of main points, poor clarity"
2,"Integrated Advertising, Promotion and Marketing Communications (4th Edition)","This book was, OK. It was the main text book used in my IMC course and I wasn't impressed. It had lots of information, which is good, but I felt it was just an average book. I wish more academic writers would change their boring and blah style."
2,didn't last long,"Despite faithfully keeping it clean, after a few runs the orange light turns on immediately and it refuses to operate anymore."
1,Piece of Junk,I bought this without checking since it was the only one left in Linens n Things for $53. Ran it once and could not get reset lite to go off. Tried every trick mentioned for Bionaire humidifiers on Amazon with apparently similar problem. Contacted Bionaire and the response was maybe the store will take it back. They did. What a pain. Bought it because I was sick.Also it make a racket. Sounds like your boiling water in a speghetti pot.Why buy something that has a defect. Much better products available. Just bought a Vicks warm mist for 39 bucks and it works fine.All these machines require constant cleaning to maintain. Buy cheap so you're not put out if it goes bad on you.
1,Popcorn,"If you like the loud sound like popcorn popping in your bedroom, thisis the humidifier for you! The features were nice but I had to sendit back.Amazon was very helpful and prompt as far as the return goes and I appreciate it."
1,Very Inconvenient.,"The instructions for this humidifier call for washing the water reservoirin the dishwasher every time it is used. This means an extra run of thedishwasher every day. A great waste of potable water, a scarce naturalresource."
1,bionaire humidifier BWM2600,The worst humidifier ever. It did work for few weeks and than die. Both light are on. Not steam come through. Payed $100.00 and garbage. Not recommended to anyone.
1,FIRE HAZARD!!!,"We bought this humidifier about 2 years ago and had a ""good"" run with it by all definitions. It worked great until it caught fire in the middle of the night last night.- It was not low on water or anything!Luckily my husband woke up and was able to carry it out and throw it in the snow before the fire spread!I'm terrified of what would have happened if this had been in my daughters bedroom!- The poor thing is 15 months old and would have been stuck in her crib until a fire alarm went off to wake us! The whole house smelled of terrible burning chemicals.I would not leave this running in a childs bedroom at night if I was you!"
1,Reset light goes on and won't go off.,This was a fine humidifier ... for the first two or three days. But then I let it run a little low on water and the reset light came on. They give you 4 or 5 steps you are supposed to follow to get it to reset. And I could never make it work again. I followed the steps and I couldn't get it to work. It is also a little loud. Even on the low setting it is hard to sleep with this thing running.
3,Heating element gets a rock hard shell,"This is a great humidifier that raised the humidity level in our bedroom from 30% to 60%. The selling point for me was ""no filter to replace"". However, every day you have to take it apart to fill it and it becomes very heavy carrying the loaded water to the base, then you are supposed to put the base in the dishwasher to clean the scum off and gently wipe off the heating element on another portion of the machine. You can't possibly clean the heating element, the chemicals from the water here in Vegas stick to that like concrete and the design around hard plastic, makes it impossible to work with. Would'nt purchase it again, would buy one with a filter. This daily cleaning is too much to ask."
2,Had to return the unit,"I only had this humidifer to one night, so I can't speak to its long-term operation. I found it to be too noisy for me to go to sleep, and it kept waking me up after I finally fell asleep. I unit makes a gurgling and popping sound like a boiling pot of water or popcorn popping. If you are a sound sleeper, this may not be an issue for you. The humidity level didn't seem especially good to me--I remember feeling dry after waking up. The tank was not that easy to fill either. Overall, I would not recommend this machine."
2,If you like popcorn this humidifier is for you,"Brought this from Bed Bath and Beyond. Strangely it wasn't turned on for demo purposes, probably to keep people from hearing the popcorn noises. Anyway, this unit is very loud and I could barely sleep even when set on low. I am returning this thing ASAP."
5,well recomended,"i put it in the tranny, now what its doing i dont know since i cant shrink down and climb inside the tranny to see,, but this stuff comes with great reviews."
4,Works great,"I do whatever I can to keep my crappy AT from failing, I pair this with Honda ATF. 2002 accord v6 138,XXX miles and original transmission still going strong"
1,Still have not received it!,"Ordered this product over a month ago, and still have not received it. Not very happy, seeing it was for a birthday gift."
2,Not the best Michael Johnson album there is.,"I am a Michael Johnson fan and had read that this was a particularly good album of his. Actually, it's quite an early album, before he hadstarted doing his own songwriting--which is what brought his fans so much pleasure, and so it's really a very mediocre album, except forone solo classic guitar piece that he does, which is extraordinary."
4,Good read-aloud,This would be a great book for reading aloud to kids--there's a lot of witty bits to keep adults chuckling to themselves.
5,Martin's Mice,"Martin's Mice is a great book.I enjoyed reading it.Martin does many funny and silly things, like keep mice as pets.Nina3rd Grade Student"
1,Not as good as Emerson,"This product is not properly described. It should be: ""BestAir Replacement Filter for Emerson"". I used this product previously and found it did not perform as well as the original Emerson part."
1,not oem filter,Once they draw water they collapse from their own weight. My humidifier filter holder is basicially a box frame the filter sit in. The original filter was rigid enough to stand within the frame and function properly. This filter once wet acted like a wet rag and collapsed in a pile at the bottom of the frame siting in a lump in the water.
5,A good read every time!,"If you like Janette Oke, you will love Hilda Stahl! I have read this series several times through, and have enjoyed each time through just as much as the first. I would also highly recommend The White Pines Chronicles (The Covenant, The Inheritance, and The Dream). If you want to live in a simpler time and place for a while, these books will take you there!"
5,Awsome!,Great book. very well written. great values to learn and of course romance! this is one of the best books that i have read. I recomend it to every one who likes a good book and fresh clean romance! awsome book read it! Mrs. Stahl is a fantastic author.
4,Quite Useful,"My husband used this book more than I have, but it did answer a lot of questions we had about Krakow. We pretty much knew nothing about the city before using this guide. We were especially grateful to have a good map."
5,One of the best self-help books published,"I've read a lot of trauma books and have found this to be one of the best. Offers information in a consise, easy to understand and easy to apply format. Have continually referenced this book as I have moved through the healing process. If I could only own one book to assist me, this would be it."
3,Change of pace for Calhoun,"Peter David's final installment with the former crew of the USS Excalibur as existing without one another. Finally we find out what happens to Mac. His path leads him to a desolate world that seems inescapable. Shelby is moving forward but keeps looking back. Not one of the better STNF novels. David has created a very dynamic starship captain that is reminiscent of Kirk in style and attitude. Something sorely missed in the next gen ST universe. However, he slows down Mac's character development by putting him on a backwater planet. Mr. David's dialogue among the characters is witty as usual which makes up for the lack of excitement in the novel. Still, it's worth reading if you're a NF fan."
2,Restoration was a Disappointment,"I will keep this brief. This is Peter David's worst New Frontier book. I recommend it only if you are an avid New Frontier fan. The plotting is poor, the dialogue stilted. Shelby's handling of her crew was terribly portrayed. The resolution of the Lefler plot from the previous book was out of place. Calhouns tale on the planet read like a poorly done western. There is so much about this book that needed improving I am leaving it to other reviewers to say. The book seemed as though it needed a re-write."
3,I waited a year for this?,"Ever since last year and the destruction of the Excalibur, I have been waiting to see the fate of Captain Calhoun, and it has finally arrived.Sorry Mr. David, but if this is the best you could come up with, perhaps we should have left him lost in space. The Calhoun storyline is an unabashed western and kept jarring me out from the very enjoyable parts of the book with Captain Shelby and her crew of the U.S.S. Exeter.I am glad that Calhoun and the Excalibur have returned, but I wish it had been with a better story line. Peter David is an excellent author, I have enjoyed his previous Star Trek and Babylon 5 novels, but I guess everyone comes up with a bad apple once in awhile.I am looking forward to the next set of adventures with Peter David, Calhoun and his crew. Just one note though, a year is too long between sets! How about a New Frontier novel once every three months instead of all at once?"
3,"Finally, a conclusion.","Peter David writes extraordinarily well, and the characters in this series are quite enjoyable. But his tendancy to have all books in the series end on cliffhangers has been annoying from the very beginning of this series; this book, while it actually has an ending for a change, outdoes even his usual style in that the cliffhanger ending from the previous book isn't even ADDRESSED until 284 pages into this one, and then the tale is told retrospectively. If you don't dislike the classic movie serial storylines that have neither beginning nor ending to call their own, you'll doubtless enjoy this book. If, like me, you believe that a novel may have carryover subplots, but that the main plot should begin and end in the same book, you will find that aspect of this book to be a major distraction from a very good storyline."
1,Boring,"Sorry, this story would be worth listening to if it was free. Poor storyline, nothing innovative, nothing gripping. I felt ripped off."
1,A fake,"I've had many prada bags and I could tell this one was fake--no doubt about it. The imprint on the inner tag was lop-sided and definitely not leather. I could go on....Plus, I returned it and have proof it was received, yet I still haven't received credit for it."
5,herbthinks,This is a real good recording. The voices remind me of the old time gospel quartets. The contemporary nature of 66 Books sounds like the Temptations singing gospel. Keep your mind on Jesus is really hot and has several great changes. It's hard to pick a favorite.
5,a truly unique recording,"Gary Schnitzer's ""Melodia"" is a wonderful recording. The man is a true viruoso on the violin who knows how to make his instrument sing. What sets this musical collection apart from Schnitzer's earlier projects is that he composed the music - every song on the CD. A gifted composer who has a real knack for writing a gorgeous melody, Schnitzer has produced some of the most beautiful contemporary Classical music on the market today. Evoking the sound of an epic film, this music provides the perfect setting for the solo violin."
4,Not as good as original but worth the money,Fits the specified humidifier and works just fine. A little less rigid so easy to scrunch when you refill the humidifier. Such a good value for the cost I would still recommend it.
2,Not the best choice,"I was surprised not to like this book, because the author's reference on C++ is one of my favorite C++ books. However, this book just does not cut the mustard. The class overviews that make up the bulk of the book never seem to have quite enough information or quite the right information, and the overview material in the early chapters isn't that great, either. Again, it's an issue of just not presenting useful information. Case in point: the discussion of ""static"" gets a total of three short paragraphs which bring up almost none of the important points about this keyword. Yet, almost two pages are devoted to recursion, which is certainly an important topic in computer science but isn't exactly the sort of thing that you're likely to be looking for when you go to a reference book on Java. If you're looking for a good general reference on Java, try David Flanagan's ""Java In A Nutshell,"" instead."
3,Just fair!,"I bought this book because my current java reference book was getting old. I chose this specific book because I have a C/C++ reference book by Herb Schildt which is excellent. In fact, I would highly recommend this book. However, I found this java reference to be too vague with not enough programming samples. I think I was expecting more from the book."
1,Completely useless,Both the belts snapped after just one use. It was scary to see smoke coming out of the vaccum.Not sure what caused the belts to snap.
5,New Retail Product,"Some of the reviews concerned me, but we needed a new belt asap. Given some of the reviewers mentioned their first belt breaking, I ordered 3 packages (total of 6) 'just in case'. We own 2 Bissells so I know they will come in handy at some point.First thing I noticed was all 3 packages were retail store packaging from Bissell. Nice.Second thing I noticed was that each belt looked perfect and went on without a hitch and runs perfectly. Now I have 5 extras. Great product."
1,Cheap for a reason,"I just received my replacement belts in the mail today and within 5 minutes of using it, one of the new ones snapped. No wonder they send them in packs of two. This is ridiculous though. Don't buy Bissell vacuums that use this part. They snap like nothing. I had some speaker wire caught in it rollers. I turn the vacuum off, unravel the wire and turn the vacuum back on. Lo and behold, it is broken"
4,I'm still a fan...,...but I think this album is a little sleepy in comparison to some of his other work. His smooth vocals always pull me back in for a little while.
3,"3, maybe 4 stars, just average","Well, new label, loss of fire?, is my fire insurance agent getting old?, this is no where near ""Wild Night Out"", not even close, do I like it?, yes and no, it just lacks any fire or emotion, it's the perfect ""muszac"" blues disc, soon to be heard in an elevator of your choice!, it's the dullest Jimmy Thackery disc in my collection, am I sorry I bought it?, hell no!, just turn on any radio in American to any music station and hear why it stands head and shoulders above what's popular now, I hope it grows on me, I plan on giving it a chance."
4,King of the Blues,Mr. Thackery has never really captured his live performance onto a tangible medium but this recording is an excellent reminder of why he should be experienced live. Songs choices are excellent and performance is outstanding. Should be experienced by mainstream audiences as well as blues enthusiests.
3,Oops ...,"Having only heard Solid Ice and Who Knows before buying this album I can only say that someone forgot to inform me that Thackery's vocals sound like Bob Dylan on his deathbed (if he isn't already). I mean, come on. The guitar chops are great, but it's a stretch to call the vocals even average for good blues."
3,Once rocking and then a bit to slow,"This album starts with some great rocking numbers, then some to slow, but then a good ending."
2,Spagetti book - no critical mass,"The book doesn't provide details required to really understand the various topics. There is no critical mass and touches all the topics. Just stick with the classics - expert one on one oracle by Tom Kyte,Essential Oracle8i Data Warehousing by Gary Dodge and Tim Gorman, you get much more. If one wants oracle9i specific features, go with oracle 9i new features by Robert Freeman."
2,There is an alternative,"While I won't use terms like ""spaghetti"" as in other reviewers commnets, I do agree with their sentiments. Not since the Gary Dodge book has there been anything of detailed substance on data warehousing. While I've attended some of Dr. Hobbs' excellent presentations and find her to be the best DW experts out there (even more so than Kimbal since he's not an Oracle guy), there is always more room to dive into details. Thus I wrote a book you can also find on Amazon titled ""Oracle DBA Guide to Data Warehousing and Star Schemas"". I'm no Dodge or Hobbs, so I merely reveal my DBA experiences on detailed DBA topics from building multi-terabyte Data warehouses. I assume you know the 50,000 foot level stuff and now need a cook book on what to do in the trenches. Worth a look see ..."
3,Works great but eventually will leak,"I find the Colpac Ice packs to be the best and most comfortable of medical ice packs. I was introduced to them by my physical therapist and have been using them for years. They mold to the shape of the body part that they rest on and this one in particular is easy to wrap around the knees, arms, shoulder or behind the neck. Note however that eventually all my Colpacs have failed after a year or so and the 'clay' inside will leak out."
2,misleading information,"I paid for a brand name I can trust and have trusted for years (Chattanooga)............I received something called a ""Patterson Medical Cold Pac"". I dont know this name, but I do know this cold pack feels less filled than my genuine chattanooga colpacs and does NOT stay as cold as long.Did they buy a ton of overstock, slightly less filled products at a discount, and resell them?Bottom line, I feel I did not get what I paid for and now Im paying the price after shoulder surgery....Im switching back to my genuine CHATTANOOGA pac in the meantime even tho it leaks a little (4yrs old).I know walmart has W_nchester make bulk ammo for them to sell in 100 round ""value packs"" and its been proven that these rounds have been underfilled at times.What shortcuts where taken on these cold pacs?"
5,product,"the chattanooga colpac ice pack 23"" is great for pain relief for the back of the neck and knee and i would recommend this item to all consumers."
5,Hi!!!!,"Hi!!! We're the Stirrup Stars. We love this book because it shows that if you just believe and do your best, you can reach your goal. Lisa took wonderful care of Eve. Also, it was full of suspense that made you want to keep on reading and never stop! Please, read this book!!! It's a great example of a horse/rider bond."
4,broken horse,"While hiking and taking nature photos for a school project, Lisastumbles across a badly abused horse in a paddock. She, Carole and Stevie call the local animal rescue league who impounds the mare. As the mare dislikes men, Lisa assumes most of the care for her. This is a very poignant tale, and I won't give away the ending."
2,'**itty,these tuner were as bad as the one coming with my guitar. cant bend a note without having to tunu ur guitar right after
1,Poor Quality,"The battery was a good fit for my compaq presario 2100, however, after a few days of charging, it went bad. I needed to buy another replacement."
1,Try another vendor,This battery shorted out my laptop and so i had to have it repaired. How do i return it on the warranty????
1,Double Charge for Shipping!!!,"I will never purchase again from this seller!I have been charged twice for the product delivery, which is unacceptable!First they charged US$30 at the purchase. Then I had to pay US$43 to the postal mail service of the country I live in. Later on, the seller wrote me concerned about my bad review of their service and they tried to negotiate a refund lower than I had to pay. I found it really insulting."
5,Enjoyable Tunes,I love this CD and the songs. I have seen Amaya in perform live and she is amazing to watch! I highly recommend this cd and I am looking foward to see Amaya perform soon. From what I hear she is working on a new CD I am sure it will be just as good if not better!
5,Sherry Glasses,Proper Sherry glasses have been difficult to find. One may guess that Amazon would have a high quality and an excellent shape.
4,Worked well.,Worked well as a general reference for my Development lab. The pictures are clear but I would like to have seen a bit more in the way of explanations.
4,5-stars If It Came With a Libretto,I agree with the other reviewers that the lack of a libretto is a shame considering the first rate performance and wonderful music (heard a little Parsifal in it). I was able to negate the problem mostly with some searching. Stanford Univ. has a German libretto and the Pocket Opera in San Francisco has an English libretto (No Love Allowed).
4,Good product,"Pros: This product is great, I am considering buying another one. I would not recommend it for your calf muscles as it is a little to hard on them, but for the feet, it is AMAZING. If you are not massaging your feet, you can use it as an ottoman.Cons: Pending how big your calf muscles are this ottoman can be a little to hard. To the point that it simply hurts. Also, the price is a little steep.Buy this product if you are on your feet most of the day or find that your feet could use a little massaging at the end of the day. You will not regret it."
2,Bad color,"Most of the time Corelle is what it shows, however, my ""blue hearts"" turned out to be a camouflaged gray. I will be sending these back. Packaging was good though."
2,Useless,The product had absolutely no effect on my health. It was a complete waste of money. I won't be buying it again.
2,Pycnogenol for Night Sweats,Unfortunately this product did not work for me. I tried it for 2 months but it had no effect on my hot flashes. I had to go back on my Premarin - boo
4,RELIABILITY!! GOOD CONDITION.,"i can always count on Amazon to deliver my books in a timely manner.. The books that i buy from Amazon are always exactly like they are said to be, as far as good or not to good, in regards to the book condition. i am looking forward to buying many more books in the future.. thanks Amazon!!!! you're AWESOME!!"
3,Good,"Bought used, slight wear as indicated. Quickly received book. No problems, would buy from again."
2,You should be making music when you read music,"I find the music in this book pretty hokey. The advanced exercises are frequently 'random' (author's term, not mine). Random note patterns have no place in any instructional music book. What a cop out! Compose something!"
4,good gun,this is a good gun. really powerful. it actually comes with cartrages that u put the bbs in so its cool.( u should put the bbs in from the bottom of the cartrage) it is very powerful and very accurate. it barely curves. the only pain about the gun is it only takes 6 shots. u hav 2 reload alot. if i was u i wouldn't use this in a airsoft war. if u do use it as a last resort gun not one u will u se alot.
2,this gun stinks,i had this gun for 2 months before it broke and almost the whole gun broke apart. the only thing that is left on this gun is the frame.i suggest u get the tangfold witness that gun shoots far is lowed price and is reliable.that is all i have to say.
4,just as good as JC Penney,I always bought these types of shirts from JC Penney and when I could not find them at Penneys I checked online and found this one and it is just s good and around the same price
4,A step up for less than some t-shirts cost,"These shirts are lightweight, pretty much just a t-shirt with a collar and pocket, slightly longer sleeves also. Great for when I want someting more than a t-shirt but not too dressy. Easy to wash, easy to wear. Great shirt for the price."
3,GREAT ITEM,"These shirts are exactly what I was looking fore and very hard to find,needed them for my work clothes and am well pleased, thanks"
4,I think she's done it!,"Rita Buchanan seems to have achieved her goal of inspiring me to ""dig up part of your yard and plant a garden there."" As a librarian, I purchased the book for my library. When it arrived, I took it home, and now I'm spending my a bit of my meager income to order a copy for myself. Experienced gardeners probably will find this too basic for their needs, but those of us who are timid but aspiring may find just the help we need. This is a very attractive book, with numerous color illustrations and photographs, and the text is both encouraging and stimulating. The try-it-you'll-like-it philosophy pervades and we are encouraged to take a deep breath, start small, but START and do SOMETHING!"
3,This was ok,"I wasn't watching NFL when Staubach was playing so I can't say how great of an influence he was on the fans at the time but there does seem a fair bit of self-love in this book.Staubach tells an ok story but it is just a little prechy for my tastes, he is a little too perfect.This book is ok if you are a big fan of Staubach and the Dallas Cowboys, but if you are looking for indepth coverage of the game and discussions on the players, you had better look elsewhere."
5,My personal favorite,"I ve taken Spirulina of Earthrise for more than 2yrs. It works so well that I feel very energetic, especially for busy days. Feeling sleepy in the first two months is normal so start using it in holidays or summer! ;p"
2,Snubbed by Earthrise,"I can't say spirulina is bad or that it is ""pond scum"". It did eliminate by bowel movement odor. However, I had side effects like a funny feeling in the chest area, almost that same feeling I used to get when taking ephedra yrs ago. I assumed allergic reaction. I tried to contact Earthrise several times and was ignored. I don't like dealing with companies that do this. Most companies I contact, will contact me back to answer my questions. Not Earthrise."
4,It grows on you...,"I was put off by the repetition in the workbook, but I got over it. :) I recommend this book to any CCNA candidate!"
5,A Little $$ But Worth It,"I ordered it as I needed a wallet/cell carry all. There are times where a purse is just too much, especially at a bar or running in & out some place. It's well made & appears rather durable. My only complaint is I wish it was just a little longer or wider as you don't have many slots to put your cards & if you carry cash you can't fold up too much in there or it won't close & you have to fold your cash because it's just barely the right length where you don't. Otherwise, it's beautiful & I love it."
1,"Raghuram, NH",I was very impressed when I bought it. But after two months the belt clip got seperated from the case. Don't feel like buying this again.
3,Not for your Motorola E815,It is universal all right. I have an extra inch or more of play on the top portion of the case. Meaning the case is just too long for the Motorola E815. Other than that it is good quality for the price you paid.
5,Works very well with my Kyocera K9,"I have an older style phone than most out today, but this case fit my Kyocera K9 very well. It's easy to slide in and out of the holder and doesn't fallout by itself. I'd imagine it works just as well for the Kyocera K10, but not sure about anyother phone."
4,"Amazon's "" Mad About Madeline The Complete Tales "" entrancing!","Amazon's "" Mad About Madeline "" is a visual treat! This collection of Madeline books is as fun as ever for readers of all ages. This is a great book for a young reader to read alone or to enjoy being read to by someone else! Madeline is ageless!"
3,mad about madeline,The book was supposed to be new. It was dirty and had a price sticker on the back that was difficult to remove and left a sticky mess. I did clean the book and with baby oil I removed the sticky mess. I emailed the sender and she was very nice and offered a new book or refund. I did not accept either offer as I was able to clean the book.
1,Wish I'd Known,"Run, don't walk, away from this book. I regret purchasing it for my daughter, and it is now on it's way back to Amazon. I was shocked to read that Madeline's neighbor uses the gift of a tool set to build a guillotine in his backyard that he uses for chopping the heads off of chickens. Are we really so desensitized to violence in this culture that this is considered acceptable? I can't believe that this book is considered a classic. What a poor choice for any child!"
3,Sticky Koans Overly Philosophical But Still Wonderful.,"The Two Plain...Two plain souls, the Crickets, lived in a meadow.One fine day speaking plainly Mr Cricket said to Mrs Cricket:Mr.""Dont you know that everyone is a buddha?""Mrs.""Shhh!!! yes, of course"", whispered Mrs Cricket, ""but, not so loud!""Mr.""...but they dont all know they are.""Mrs.""yes, yes! why do you have to be so philosophical?!""Mr.""Some will hear and disbelieve, some will be uncertain, and the rare one will be hit by a sledge hammer (enlightenment)! He will know!Mrs.""yes, answered Mrs Cricket... always dreaming, my dear one! Careful not to drop that bucket now! You will soak the carpet (moss).""Mr.""Theres 'nothing' to it! said Mr Cricket.Mrs.""Oh yes there is"" retorted the Mrs... Faith in oneself my dear old Buddha"".[Story from the Plain Buddha School of Direct Transmission, AKA. School of the Fat One]With love from, Snow-flake. xxx"
2,Interesting but not for beginners,This book has detailed written information about the forms which will satisfy most qigong fans. The photographs with each form are of such poor quality and too small that is is difficult to use this book as a method of practice. It would have been better had the author dropped the original Chinese text (left-hand page)and put a series of clearer photos so that the form could be practised. There are no available videos for this book and therefore should not be regarded as a practise text for people new to this style.
5,great qigong book,"This book is very good, and fairly easy to understand if you have some martial arts training. I have studied chin na and san da with professor liu and must admit he is very good. This is one of his few books that has both the english and chinese in it, and the actual material is taught in the Kansas City area of the states when he gets a chance to visit from China. END"
3,Very disappointed,"I bought this for my Grandson'6th birthday. He has everything so I try to be different and still impress. He could not put it together even with assistance. After it was put together, he was done with it. Worst yet, the toy was broken inside. Bottom line, I'm not happy with the truck. I'm sure, for an older child, it would be more educational and even fun, provided it isn't broken."
3,Not for 3 year olds!,This toy is much to complicated for my three year old son. Every little piece comes apart and they're very easy to loose. I would recommend this toy for a child 5-8 years old.
5,Charlton Heston's finest work,"This is some of Charlton Heston's finest work. Mr. Heston's premise is that before the Bible was written down it was told orally in the way of a story and passed down from generation to generation until Moses started to write the first five books down. He recreates this style of story telling. He and his son Fraser show how the Bible has influenced the arts.He also, contrary to the other review, dramatizes the Bible stories as a one man performance in an old Roman ampitheatre in Jerusalem. In between he takes you around and shows some of Israel's greatest Judeo-Christian monuments. He traces the history of the Bible and how it came to be all the way up to the King James version of 1611. This is the 3rd in the series and if you would like to see everything from The Creation through the Life of Christ I highly recommend this thought provoking and entertaining series. Each DVD has a behind the scenes segment included, but it is the same behind the scenes on each DVD."
1,Very disappointed,"I bought this book because it was on a list of top ten books related to this subject. I was disappointed with the words, the pictures, and the drawing of God. The last bothered me the most. I was planning on ordering her book, Dog Heaven, but this was such a disappointment that I decided to not order it."
3,Cold Noses at the Pearly Gates,"I manage two animal hospitals and as such have been working steadily to increase our lending library of children's books. One topic I have devoted recent attention to is pet loss. This book is a good and gentle read, but I worry about the religious overtones. Do we as a business have any business imtroducing religious concepts into a child's grief process?"
2,Depressing,This book isn't very uplifting & left us very sad. I hope our kitty is in heaven and it isn't like this. Certainly upsetting to children.
5,Hughly comforting and sweet!,"My daughter and I discovered this book in our library not too long after we found Cythnia Rylant's, ""Dog Heaven."" We both delighted in the thought of the cat's life hereafter with God in Heaven and Ms. Rylant's words and illustrations made it seem as wonderful as we hope it will be. Of course, we had to purchase our own copies of both books and I highly recommend them to anyone who's lost a special feline or canine family member. Cat and Dog Heaven books are gentle and sweet, just as our beloved pets. The illustrations are magical and calming. I think the books help to make a possibly frightening subject, much less so."
4,Good For Kids,"This was a very good book for a child that loses a pet. I bought it for a friend that is 30ish, and wish that I had read more of it before I bought it. It is cute, but would be much better for a younger reader. I lost a pet of 21 years and think that it would have been nice to receive a book of this sort from a friend."
5,CAT HEAVEN,"For any cat worshipper/person who has loved and been loved by a special cat who has since crossed the Rainbow Bridge, do not miss out on owning and reading this beautiful, warmly written book . Yes, you'll cry, but you'll also smile as all of the wonderful memories of a most special beastie that shared your life come to mind.Add this one to your cat book collection...you'll be so happy that you did."
4,Good book,Book was in good condition minus the writing inside the cover page. Don't remember that being disclosed before I bought it.
2,Not Recommended,"This wasn't at all comforting and made Maxie seem even more lost to us, more distant. I wish my kids hadn't seen the picture of the poor lonely cat outside in the night, watching his family home, unable to join them. Maxie never went outside. Just heartbreaking. I recommend The Loss of a Pet: Coping With The Grieving Process When a Pet Dies by Wallace Sife, Ph.D. for some wonderful help. Cold Noses at the Pearly Gates is good also in explaining the death of a pet to youngsters. This book did not help and probably made it more difficult. Definitely Not Recommended for anyone still processing their grief."
2,Not Great Got this book and it was not a great,"Got this book and it was not a great but not a bad book, I guess I was looking for something different."
4,Fine on the 2nd Try,"The first unit I received did not work. Amazon quickly and painlessly replaced it, and the 2nd unit is working fine.I keep it in an unfinished part of the basement, and it works very well. The noise is audible in the finished portion of the basement, but it's not a big deal (there's also a vented water heater and HVAC making even more noise).Note that if you want the unit to drain continuously (vs. filling a reservoir that you need to empty manually), then you need to be able to drill a small hole in the bottom of the reservoir. It's not hard, but you will need a drill and bit. The unit comes with a rubber stopper to plug this hole in case you want to use the reservoir later."
1,It doesn't work.,"I paid a lot of money for this dehumidifer and it worked ok(not great) for one season. Then it stopped sucking water out of the air. The engine runs, but there isn't a drop of water in the tank and it's in a high humidity location. It's getting kicked to the curb tomorrow and I'll never buy this brand again.I also had a Bionaire dehumidifier once that worked really well, except the tank was fragile and got cracked easily. I think I'll go back to Bionaire and just be careful handling the tank."
4,Review of DeLonghi DE400-40 Pint,"This is my second DeLonghi dehumidifier and I am very pleased so far.It is quiet, efficient and removes moisture from my basement. My only negative is that the water tank does not lift out easily for me.I still recommend it highly."
3,smaller water basin - need to empty a lot,"Seems to work fine, although the 40 pint holding basin is not as large as my older dehumidifier that held 60 pints and allowed me to change it only once a day, as opposed to several times a day. This has been a wet summer, so that could be part of it. It has a useful, although very annoying and insistent beep when the water is full."
1,Where's the beef?,"The title page on Amazon website says the book is 100 pages. it's actually 64 pages, of which 10 are table of contents, index and glossary. The entry for ""Watches after 1945"" is 2 pages longI'm returning it"
3,pretty weak for a book,"Few pages, little info. I would have been better off spending the money to get a Big Mac Meal and a Starbucks coffee as a chaser."
3,Good 70's european fusion,"Along the lines of Isotope, Moving Gelatine Plates, Perigeo, late Tasavallan Presidentti, etc.... though , just like these bands mentioned, they do not break any new ground. Lots of hot solos from (mostly) the wind instruments, keys and guitarist (who at time reminds of McLaughlin). Quite good and recommended if the groups mentioned tickle your fancy."
2,Historical text,This book concentrates on the historical buildings of the period. It includes numerous black and white photos of old buildings. This is definitely not a book for someone wanting to build a modern colonial home and hoping to find some ideas.....
2,Lansdale learning his chops,"This is early Lansdale, and it shows. Some bad dialogue, plot problems, awkward sentences. But you can see where he's going. I'm surprised he managed to get this published at all at the time -- he was lucky. Intereting, but I had a hard time getting through it. A waste of $5, all around."
2,Book goes to off topic.,I'm 12 and I thought that this book was ok except for one major problem. That problem is that they would be traveling and one would tell a completely unrelated story to another. Also there were some really boring parts. The book is decent but I wouldn't recremend it.
1,Terrible and boring. Overly verbose and unclear.,"The author regularly refers to this book in this book. Example: Something something CLECs, which we've discussed in chapter 2, something something terminating access monopoly, which we will discuss in chapter 7. This occurs frequently. Sometimes the examples are clear and sometimes the definitions are easy to follow. But most of the time the sentences are more twenty words, some more than thirty. This makes things unclear, obviously. Furthermore, i got the kindle version. It appears the publisher scanned the book, ran that through OCR, then called it good. There are many annoyances... back becomes hack (happens about twenty times in one chapter), 1984 becomes I 984, CLEC becomes CIFC, and more! Yay! Crap all the way up and down. This is a required book for my Telecom Policy class. It is likely there is not anything else out there which covers this overly boring topic of the history and current policy of telecom in the states."
2,Not great but not horrible,"This was assigned reading for a graduate class in economics (antitrust economics) and was not my favorite reading. I love reading textbooks, but this book was difficult. It is written by lawyers that are too eager to say all that they know rather than create a logical and flowing outline within chapters. The book is comprehensive but not easily accessible. I may be biased since I find equations and mathematical relations more elucidating than prose, but nevertheless, this book is not my favorite. The material in the book could be written in about 150-200 pages with no loss in content, instead they chose to make it over 400 pages. The prose is excessively ornate to a fault. The content is good, but it is obvious this is written by lawyers, NOT economists. That is plainly clear. If I had six free months of life, I would rewrite this book."
3,Good,I had to read this for a graduate class. It is written in a conversational manner. It does explain the topics in reasonable voice. Overall not a bad purchase. It is not something that I will keep but it is good for a library to have.
1,Does Nothing,"Within 30 seconds of wearing this product, I could tell that it had no therapeutic value. It is merely a girdle that provides no lumbar support."
4,Frank in ATL,"Very good and very comfortable to wear. Following lower back surgery I now wear this when I plan on sitting for long periods such as evenings after dinner watching TV or reading or when working at mt computer. It helps to correct posture and keep a firmer back.The only draw back is velcro. After about a year the velcro will have lost its gripping power and the support will have to be replaced. I have found no way to revive velcro once it goes bad. I would prefer snaps, hooks or a belt like system for closure."
3,You need three arms and it's a bit smaller than I expected,"What more can I say? Sizes like ""X Large"" are necessarily vague. I'm 6'2"", 225 lbs. That hardly makes me a giant in 21st century America. Also, the straps and velcro wrap all over the place. The tough fit makes the awkward straps/velcro worse."
3,it's an ok product,I ordered this back support to replace the one my husband wore out. he says this one is ok but it does get very hot when he is working outside in the summer. it also does not have a very strong support system especially with the work my husband does around the yard. but the product is as described in info obtained on amazon.
5,Works well,"This brace is made of reasonably high quality material, and provided sample support for when I tweaked my back."
1,Improperly sized,"The Back Support was stated with a Small to Medium size and it doesn't even come close to what was stated in the description. It said I believe that it would fit up to a 39"" waist. My waist is less than 36"" and I couldn't get the two ends to meet. I am very disappointed. Unfortunately in order to get it out of the packaging, all of the packaging was thrown away so I felt it would not be accepted for return. I have the product but not the original package."
4,Future Back Support,"I ordered this for my daughter-in-law because she's on her feet all day as a vet tech, and I'm very happy with mine - I even wear it while washing dishes, because it feels like someone with firm hands is holding me up."
5,$27.49 It's surprisingly comfortable,I was skeptical when I pulled this out of the box but it is comfortable and sturdy. My back feels so much better.
3,Easy use wide belt.,"This belt has pads at the spine to apply pressure. This helps when laying down and gives some addtional support when using lumbar support to sit, but it is hard to keep the pads alligned correctly with your spine and they don't seem very effective when standing. The belt is easy to get on and off as the smaller stretch belts attach to the primary strap, so you only need one attachment to put it on once you have it adjusted initially. The belts that I have used that I prefer cost $500 or more, so this may be a good comprimise if you don't want to spend the money."
4,Finally! A good fit,"I sit at a desk for hours: my posture has suffered. This is an excellent brace. I can get up, sit up, I can eat lunch. I can walk and it's barely perceptible. Not too tight."
3,Good ideas IF you can figure out what the author is trying to say.,Good ideas IF you can figure out what the author is trying to say. It would help if he were writing in everyday English.
5,Almost as good as in person!!,How can you not love this... I pulled up so many of these on youtube that I knew I needed the whole concert!
1,I can not use it !,"This DVD is scratched and I can not play it. I wrote an e-mail to the company where it came from but I did not hear back from them. I like Willi Nelson. I am from Austria and I just more or less discovered his artistry. Maybe you can help me ? Thanks, Sonja"
4,Willie's Birthday Party,"Ray Charles' performance of ""A Song for You"" was worth the price of the DVD."
4,Willie/Ray/Leon are priceless.,"The set with Willie, Ray Charles and Leon Russel alone is worth the price of this DVD. The bonus sets are better than some of the sets that made the main DVD...be sure to watch them. I am very happy that I have this for my collection....but didn't understand a couple of the performers that were included for a party for Willie...but what do I know."
3,The Design Needs work.,"I bought this Platform to put on one of my Gitzo Tripods. It does not work as described, it is not stable on any of my Gitzo tripod. However with a little creativity I got it to work. I had made a washer with the outside diameter of 40mm and inside diameter of 15mm, about 3mm thick. I placed this washer between the Tripod and the Platform, and it now is stable, and strong."
3,Sent it back,"I wanted this for live performance shooting with Canon 5d; I thought it was kind of pricy, for what you get. What I didn't like about it was there are no adjustments to angle the platform, it stays perfectly flat, (couldn't tell from the product image) only room for my 15"" MacBook Pro-- the stand looks good and was stable, I wouldn't worry about my laptop on it. You will also need a pro tripod to mount it to (you take the head off), so it really ends up being an expensive set up. So if these issues don't concern you, get it. I couldn't spare my best tripod and ended up purchasing a conductor/music stand for $20 and a dolly for $32, there is room on the music stand for my external drive."
4,Shmiling...,"This series of two for ones from Fela Kuti are great value.The overall sound is warm and clear with very good separation and definition of sounds.I have to say that this one is worth the price for the first track Shuffering and Shmiling alone,this is a funky , jazzy masterpiece that cannot be denied.If you want to dance and you want to sing...Fela is the king"
5,Purchased as a reference,Not a big book. Well written the case problems used in the book are developed is succeeding chapters to outline the design and mechanical operation of ABC systems and techniques.I found the book very useful in studying unit operations for my employer and in studying them in ways that I would not previously have thought to do and then construct ABC models for them. In the case of one business the lessons I learned in this book enabled me to construct models that represented the problems of the business clearly. This information enabled action to be taken that improved the results achieved by the business by 18% (% sales) within 90 days.Perhaps the answers could have been found by other means but this book put me on the right track and was readily implementable.
4,Glad to have it,"Researched many, and feel I made absolutely the right choice. It now graces our deck and makes it the elegant ""porch"" I hoped it would be. Chose almond, though would have preferred other colors, because previous reviewers said the darker colors faded.Well constructed and easy to assemble. Though poles are infinitely larger and heavier than I expected, it just means the gazebo is that much sturdier. Love the mosquito netting that hooks on like a shower curtain -- all four sides -- that can be tied back to the four corners or enclose you when the rain falls or the bugs bite.Very happy."
4,Not for Action Junkies,"This is somewhat like a Life Time movie, but better. It's about a man who is a lawyer asked to take on a case by an old Judge who wants to make sure the defendant is defended without a hitch. The state's attorney is pretty ruthless in a bland sort of way when prosecuting the case. It's a mystery where inner turmoil is explored, sometimes with great anguish. If you are looking for a thrill a minute, this ain't it. This is a slow building mystery suspense that makes the viewer actually think about what is going on. Particularly great for a rainy/snowy Saturday/Sunday afternoon."
1,Not Good,"This is the first review I've written here. After reading a number of glowing endorsements of this film, I feel compelled. The fact that one appreciates the theme/message of a movie is great, but it doesn't necessarily follow that the film was well-done. It wasn't here. Both the writing and the acting were poor, embarrassingly so at times; and both the story and the characters were remarkably underdeveloped. For a lawyer, the courtroom scenes were almost unwatchable. One of the poorest courtroom dramas/depictions I've seen; television included."
1,"Don't do it, you'll be sorry","This movie is awful. It sounds from the description like a second rate John Grisham pot boiler; in reality it's more like fifth rate.Script is amateurish and predictable, dialog is wooden, it hits every cliche in the courtroom drama book, and the plot ultimately makes no sense. Aside from Robert Forster (always great, imho) the acting is almost nonexistent.And what the hell happened to Matthew Modine? He looks and acts like a zombie in this film. In fact, if he WAS a zombie, it would have been much better. Two hours of my life and $4 I will never get back. Don't you make the same mistake."
4,Liked it !!!!!!!!!!!!,I thought this was a GOOD movie. I did not find it predictable like another viewer stated.The acting was not exceptional yet it was watchable N not any trash thrown in that one findsso often these days. I will recommend it to friends n family.
1,A poor Made-For-TV grade movie,"Really disappointed in this. The acting is poor across the board.....which usually means a poor director. If you like Matthew Modine as I do, look elsewhere. I can't say much about the plot either. Again, made for TV quality."
3,Feels Like An Episode of Matlock,"The Trial feels like watching an episode of Perry Mason or Matlock. It's a nice courtroom drama film about a depressed lawyer who's tasked with defending a boy accused of murder.The problem for the defendant is he can't remember the event. He claims he would never have killed the girl because he loved her. But is he telling the truth or is the amnesia just a clever ploy?The Trial stars Matthew Modine (Memphis Belle, What the Deaf Man Heard) as attorney Mac who is depressed because his family has been killed in a car accident.Bob Gunton (Patch Adams, 24) plays the prosecution seeking the death penalty.And Randy Wayne (To Save A Life) plays Pete Thomason: the accused.Rated PG-13 for thematic material and a disturbing image, The Trial offers your basic courtroom drama with a couple twists that may surprise you."
3,The Trial,"The Trial could have been so much more than it was. It is a decent and CLEAN movie. It might have been as good as a John Grisham if it had a bit more of thrilling sensation. It had some elements of christianity but not enough to give it a slant. I would say the biggest downfall of this movie is the acting, well, mostly the supporting actors."
1,"Don't be fooled! Downright terrible, made-for-tv (bad tv) movie","I'm frankly stunned that there are any positive reviews for this movie, and I am a generally positive person. It's such a mundane, poorly written and acted, unrealistic, empty, and uninteresting retread of a trial movie that I have to suspect some of the contributors of moderate-to-good reviews have an interest in promoting the movie.Initially, I thought Modine's dead performance was an attempt to mimic a man burdened by zombie-like grief. Then I realized he is grief-stricken in real life, resigned to his fate as a formerly great actor in a currently terrible, low-budget disaster."
2,Terrible Movie,"I was tempted to dump this movie several times. The dialogue, particularly in the trial is not realistic. The jury verdict in no way reflects the evidence. Everything about this silly movie was predictble and boring.Just not worth watching. I'm not certain why I gave it two stars."
1,What an absolute piece of bilge....,"Don't make the same mistake I made and spend good money to watch this piece of nonsense. If I had paid full price to see this at a local theater I would have demanded a full refund of the cost of my ticket, claiming severe abuse to mysense of rationality. The plot was so phony you have to wonder if the author had ever witnessed a real trial.The above comments use up about seventy words of the recommended length of ""75 to 300"" words that make up a good review. I could fill up the rest of the space by repeating ""What a turkey!..What a turkey!...but somehow it seems unfair to the turkey."
5,great product,Great product and service. This really helps nerve pain. I like this brand because it dissolves quickly and works fast. I get knee and hip pain from my spine and this really helps.
1,NOT THE SAME FORMULA as ORIGINAL PURE PET PEARL!!!,"I don't know what Amazon sold me -- but it certainly is NOT the authentic shampoo that had coconut oil and lathered well that the original formula was! This barely lathered, did not have any scent, was a weakend, cut version of what the original product was. I didn't realize -- but apparently the seller is hiding behind having Amazon distribute it for them. I intend on returning this product and trying to find from a direct seller rather than a 3rd party thru Amazon. This is frightening that someone can adjust the contents using the same bottle and then resell as if it's new. Same thing with the closeout product I bought on Amazon that was supposed to be a Freeman's liquid foot powder - I have an original purchased from a local drug store and the formulation is much more dense where the one I got from Amazon was watered down and only 3/4 full container! What gives???"
2,:(,After only a short time this product faded from the sun. i would have expected something that was made to be outdoors to last longer.
4,Awesome shoes,"Terrific shoes--great quality, great price. Bought the dark brown--Would have loved them in black too--but not available. Amazon, terrific service!!!"
5,Keep On Movin CD,"Tricia Kelly ""Keep On Movin'"" 8-song CD stars: ***** Wow! This is so funky! It starts off v. classical sounding- a little twinkly piano but then Tricia busts out with her funky-disco~ish singing and you are just blown away! I am f**** amazed! Tricia rocks her voice is incredibly sexy, harmonic and just plain gorgeous! I have repeated the first track three times at this rate I might get these reviews done for a week! ""Keep On Movin'"" literally makes you get out of your seat and shake what your mama gave you! I love her style- blending the funky/soulful/sexy vocals with this contemporary, yet funk enhanced backing music. I have yet to find a track that I don't adore- and I did finally make it through the entire CD but here are my ""top"" picks: ""Keep On Movin"", ""I've Got Me"" & ""Bad Habit"". You owe it to your CD collection to buy this disc!"
4,"kings x ,galextic cowboy sounding",I agree with the other reviewers here nothing new but still interesting .I shows you how the galextic cowboys got there start and it does sound alot like them and kings x if you like these two bands give it a shot. I hope this review was helpfull to you
5,Great little book,"My son has been devouring books about Concorde and this little book includes lots of information, including some interesting facts he hasn't read about in other books."
5,Great book!,It's a great book. I think Ms.Bryant did a nice job. But I think this should have had a story about Deborah too. Otherwise I loved the book!
4,Good Book!!,"hi us and are best friend are the stable club. we read alot of bonnie's books. we think this one was great. Deborah askes the saddle club to tell her a story about each of them without horses! can carole possibly tell a story about herself without horses? well we liked stevie's story. Lisa's story was good but, CHARM SCHOOL!!! come on she's only 8yrs old!! we feel bad for lisa. charm school! yuck!!! we liked carole's story the best though. she says shes talking about a dog, but guess what it really is?! you probably know, i mean after all carole can't possibably tell a story of her life that doesn't have at least one horsey part in it!!!! if you want to talk horses, then e-mail us at the address above. ( it doesn't include the names.) remember, horses ALWAYS rule!!!!!!!!"
3,Useful Knowledge,"I found this book well-written and by & large, accurate. Other books I've found helpful have been Molly Wigand's and especially a new book out by Sandra Miller-Louden, called Write Well & Sell: Greeting Cards. Armed with any of these books, a ""newbie"" can certainly break into the business of card writing."
2,disappointed,"I was disappointed in the lack of helpful pertintant information in this book. It seemed to be geared to someone(a child perhaps) that didn't know to ""gather pencils and paper to write""I can honestly say I found NOTHING helpful in this little book to help me on my journey toward writing for greeting card cmpanies."
3,Please note the year this book came out...,"This book was decent, and I learned several things I did not already know. I'm definitely glad I read it. Plus, it was a very quick read. But please note something that I did not before purchase: it was written over a decade ago, when computers were just becoming truly popular. It recommends you purchase an electric typewriter. So a few things are outdated, but it is a good book."
4,A good light read,"An entertaining light read, I liked the historical aspect and the story kept you involved to the end.I look forward to the next book in the series"
1,Predictable,A very predictable read. The characters and story line seemed unrealistic and sappy. Would not recommend unless there is nothing else to read.
3,Everything in Its Time,"I thought Ms. Davis could have put more depth and realization to her characters and their surroundings. Ms. Davis should read Diana Gabaldon's Scottish Novels, and then recognize how much was missing in this book."
5,Excellent Story...,This was one of those storys that is a one time sit down finish book read... So be prepared to not be able to put it down until its done... Wish it were me!!!
3,Good book,"While I was intrigued by the story line this book was hard to read through. I felt while reading that there should have been something more to the story,almost like it was missing a plot. But I did enjoy it for the most part. I read preview of her next book in this series..it sounds more intriguing. We shall see."
2,Every thing in its time,Rather a repetitive book and we never did find out how they moved from modern times to the past. Not a terribly interesting story either.
3,"Too much sex, not enough story!","This is a fantastic book to read. I had never heard of Ms. Davis but have read several Diana Galbalgon books and many other time travel books. I got hooped with Jude Devereau's ""Knight in Shining Armor"". These types are my all time favorite types of reading.I would recommend these book to anyone that loves Historical romances. They are absolutely a must read."
2,Everything in it's time,"The series was listed as a trilogy so my understanding was that each book would be a succession of the previous. However none of the books directly relate except to vaguely refer to persons in the previous books. Characters too easily accept the existence of time-travel, which maybe a necessity due to the length of the books. All three were quick reads with intersting story lines, but just couldn't get invested in the characters."
5,A Key to the Organization of All Knowledge,"I honestly live my life by these volumes. They provide the key to the organization of all of humankind's knowledge, past and present! And they are a real page-turner. This is NOT dry, dusty, and archaic stuff. Not only do I have one set by my desk, I keep another set on my nightstand, for those long nights when I have my jammies on and I'm all settled in but I'm having a bit of difficulty drifting off to slumber land. Try it, you'll like it."
5,A very special performance,"It's hard to describe Furtwangler's own music - a bit like Franz Schmidt, maybe, with definite traces of Bruckner. Ultimately, it is quite a distinctive style and it is surprising that so little of his music has been recorded. The symphony under review is relatively long, coming in at 80 minutes.This performance is something quite special! The Vienna Phil had apparently never played it before the concert from which the recording is taken, but sound as if they have been playing it as long as their beloved Mozart. The sheer depth and range of the playing under the composer's own inspirational baton are, in my view, worth acquiring the disc for on their own. The 1953 recording (mono of course) does call for a degree of tolerance, but overall the sound is quite rich and full, albeit a bit edgy on top. But who cares given a performance of this quality. Thoroughly recommended."
4,"Smart, sophisticated, fun and compelling","Wong Fei-Hong Meets Little Strudel gets better the more you listen to it. The tunes are deceptively simple, luring you in with an easy shuffling groove, and revealing themselves as you get to know them better. The combination of violin, saxophone, accordion and weird percussion is fantastic, and the textures keep changing and morphing. The tango, Hotcakes, is my current favorite. It's all style, sophistication and irony, yet it has an undeniable goofiness, which makes it so much more enjoyable than a lot of the instrumental albums out there these days. I've listened to this album a lot, and it keeps delivering."
1,Don't use with batteries!,"The design for using the DC adapter with LED Booklight is extremely poor. It is possible that I missed the warning that tells you to remove the batteries before using the DC adapter. But, it must not have been very big. I combined the two and ended up with batteries that leaked all over inside the battery case. These were brand new batteries. There does not seem to be anything protecting the batteries from the DC adapter and so the power goes right into them. This is bad. Modern devices are expected to work with either battery or adapter without having to remove the batteries.I had assumed that I could leave the batteries in so that when I was at home I could use the adapter, but traveling I would use the batteries. Don't make this mistake."
5,A look into a dream,"This book gives a great look at deep sea recovery,how the space program really looked behing the facade, and how tenacity can pay off in the end."
5,Grandson loves it,Bought this as a gift for my grandson. Very nice and easy for 3 year old hands to play with. Well made and durable.
5,So Much Fun,"So, there are a lot of small parts, but it is so much fun. I bought these little fire guys for my 3 year old nephew and he LOVES it. My 4 year old daughter had a good time playing with it too. When my 1 year old boy gets a little older I will get it for him too."
2,"Cheap, but okay","Does not compare to PLAYMOBIL products, but it's fun for a while. These are cheaply made and the pieces have almost all broke in some way. I would not recommend this, but would recommend a higher quality product like PLAYMOBIL for a better long term investment in play."
3,a must have to perserve your family's history,"This book is great, you learn so much about your family, so much more than if you just looked at a family tree. This lets you know what you mom & dad did on their first date. The only problem is getting your family to fill it out."
4,Great book but....,"This is a great book with wonderful, thought provoking questions, but beware, there is no space in this book to write responses. Ideal if you will be writing in a separate journal or tape recording answers. I was disappointed with the layout, as I wanted the receipient to be able to write directly into the book."
5,The BEST book for geneologists: beginners and pro's.,"I received a copy of this book by default. You see, it was supposed to be my Father's birthday present from his sister. Unfortunately, my father died 6 months before he was to get it. Upon receipt of it, I looked through, but didn't seem too interested at the time. After I had plenty of time to look it over, it started me on a journey that I never thought that I would be on. Now that I can say , ""I am a Geneologist"", I am glad that my Aunt gave it to me. It has given me an unexpected tie to my Father that I wouldn't have had. I could only say Thank-You to Bob Greene and his Sister for writing such a book. For our ""current"" histories will not be lost as those of our past, because I know which questions to ask. Thankyou from the bottom of my heart."
3,Good for all,"I am using this book to add to a family tree album that I will be giving my sons for Christmas. While it is helpful, it does exclude someone who has been married two or more times. I had to fill out two diffent pages for two different marriages. However, what is really wonderful about the book is that you answer pertinent questions and leave others blank. I think both our sons will find the book interesting. When I finish I will sit my husband down and he can do one also! Worth investing in."
5,Memories,"Not only will this be a book enjoyed by those who read it, but the one filling in the blanks will find surprises and memories of days gone by,,,,,,it opens up your past and surprises you with what all still sits in the vault of your mind. You will enjoy filling in the empty spaces,,,,as your loved ones will treasure them forever. Nice surprise, well binded book to last a lifetime.....cherished memories of those you love,,,,always a page away,,,forever passed down,,and enjoyed with every page turned. Everyone, Mothers, Fathers, Aunts, Uncles, Grandparents should invest such a small amount for a beautiful book filled with priceless thoughts and stories."
5,To Our Children's Children: Preserving Family Histories for Genearaations to Come,"In 2003 a genealogy friend of mine loaned me her copy of this book. It is a great book, has a lot of questions for interviewing family members about their memories. The questions in the book are catagorized in chapters, for example everything about Family and ancestry is one chapter, holidays and celebrations, high school and military career. Look up what you want to ask and it is there.I have been looking in bookstores since then for a book for myself. Could not find one. I had to make a copy of my firend's book so I can interview myself first, others second, lot of fun. I was glad that Amazon.com had this book. I got it within the last 2 or 3 months and I am going to purchase anther book for my former boss' son who I am teaching how to do genealogy.Highly recommended for anyone to use for interviews."
5,family history chronolog,"Great book, well organized, and gives headings for you to record your thoughts. I gave this as a gift to my sister-in-law who is always telling family storiesand she is also a new grandmother of 2...thought it would be a great idea for her to write down some of those stories...she was thrilled"
5,2 is definitely better than One,"This game rocks from a 2 player co-op perspective as the whole game emphasizes this point. The graphics are really good and the gameplay is like all shooter games, but you are now forced to work as a 2 unit team where the gameplay mechanics require cooperation and teamwork of both players. I like that this game attempts to add a new spin on the shooter mechanics and it's a much welcome change. I definitely recommend this game to those out there looking to have a game where they can work with a friend to go through the missions."
4,Not a bad shooter game,"Overall it's a decent shooter game. I'm not dissapointed in buying it. I have played better tho. If you're looking more into going onlne, stick with Call of Duty 4. If you are looking to give something new a try this game is a good choice."
4,Army of Two,"Game was engaging and challenging at the same time. The weapons custimization was not all that I hoped it to be, but still gave you something to work towards. Overall game is decent and a fun play through once or twice."
4,very good game 8.5,This is an above average game not great but really good. The single player campaign is good while it lasted. The multiplayer is pretty good but nowhere near halo 3. The graphics are nice which complement the gameplay well. This is not your typical shooter but is a nice break from the ordinary.overallsgraphics 8.5gameplay 9.0sound 8.5story 6.5overall 8.5
4,Army Of Two!! Excelente Elección,"Army Of Two! es un excelente juego para jugar en cooperativo, excelentes misiones y en general muy buen shooter en primera persona comparable con CoD pero mejor por que es multiplayer Coop en pantalla dividida!!No se arrepentiran de tenerlo!"
3,its OK,I played this with my cousin who was over here for a week. It takes a few hours to finish. The controls can be a little hard to remember at first and the language is pretty strong. The double player thing is cool though. Somehow it wasn't as fun as i expected it to be. I suggest renting it.
3,El mejor shooter para dos personas,"Es el mejor juego shooter de aventuras para dos personas, normalmente estaba acostumbrado a shooter para una persona pero este juego revoluciona eso y para los que no nos gusta jugar solos es la mejor opción"
4,It's a good game.,My son suggested this game for me. I ended up buying it. I like the game. The game is crazy fun. I'm glad I bought it.
4,fun,"fun, can be difficult at times but lots of fun in couch co-op mode. would recommend playing with a friend.campaign is like 5 hours with 2 bonus missions to download for free, so like 6-6 and a half hours of entertainment."
4,Solid Game,"I'm finishing the game solo the first time through, before I invite someone else to play it with on the hardest mode. I am enjoying this game a lot so far, I'm about halfway through the game. Yes, its short, but I think there is a good replay value with it. It's a lot like Gears of War, with a couple small improvements in the actual gameplay, great graphics, and good AI. The story is nowhere near as good as Gears, of course I'm only halfway through it, so maybe there are things to come, but the story isnt what grabs you, its the gameplay. There are a few unique options i havent seen before, but nothing completely groundbreaking. Its worth a try, rent it first and if you enjoy it as much as I do then buy it."
3,The definition of average,"My wife loves shooters (first and third person). We are constantly rotating between good offline coop shooters. We picked up Army of Two for cheap and have finished the game once without much desire to go back for more. There isn't anything wrong with Army of Two, but nothing right either. The graphics are very average. The sound is also very average. The story is quite silly, not that story matters much in shooters while the level design is very bland. The game offers nothing new or exciting but rather just gets the job done. Compared to Gears, Rainbow Six, Halo, Resistance and other coop games it just comes up short. For those who really want another coop game and have played all the games listed above, it is fun and has its moments, but if you haven't played one of the game listed above do yourself the favor and grab one of those instead. Average game."
2,Lucky to get 2 stars,"I absolutely love first person shooter games. I've been an avid fan of them since the early days of Doom. And I usually play them all.I was excited when this game came out, it sounded really interesting because of the Co-op. Well, save your money.While the graphics are not too bad, and the storyline is at least average if not better, the controls are absolutely horrible. In my opinion the thing that makes or breaks a FPS is the ability to control your character's movement *intuitively*. Having to snap back to back to keep a circle cleared may work really well in real life, but it is so confusing in a game that I literally sold the game after playing it for 2 hours. I tried really hard to get into the controller and get used to it, and I'm a pretty patient person, but try as I did, I just couldn't get good at the controls.My advice is to rent this game first! Try it out, see if you are okay with the control layout BEFORE you invest your money.I hope this was helpful."
2,A HUGE letdown,"I got this game with my friend because we were waiting for months before its release. We got it and the first 15 minutes were fun. It got repetitive and boring and its exactly like gears of war. The game is really really short and not worth the money, we beat it in 2 nights and i traded it in the next day. EA messed up on this one"
3,Gears of War...revisited.,"Unfortunatly, I was not impacted with this title as with Gears of War. Blind shooting is not really blind shooting. There' a crosshair. I did appreciate the strategy involved, though. Overall, It's a fun title but may not meet the standards of other shooters."
5,sweet game,"i have gotta admit. i thought this game wuz gonna be pretty lame, but after i played it all the way through with my friend i was apalled. this has gotta be one of the best shooter coop games i have ever played. hands down"
1,WOW,"I thought this would be so much better. Don't watch the ads because that is not what the game is like. There are far to many load screens that take an eternity. People have said this is like gears of war. It is not even close!!!!!!! It steals ideas from there and them makes them bad. Terrible interface and many glitches!! What is the deal with the melee attacks. It is the same button as shoot so you never know what it is going to do.This is fun if you have someone to play with. Other wise forget it, this is a waste of money and an insult to the name Gears of War. They tried far to hard to add cool little things like congratulating your partner, and videos with awesome graphics.Story is very bad does not flow at all and very abrupt ending. You can hardly even tell that you are fighting the last guy until he is dead.DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Call of Duty 4 ruined every other shooter,"After playing CoD4, It's very difficult to play anything else without comparing.The graphics and the cut scenes in Army of 2 are great. The story line is pretty good, and the selection of weapons is cool...but thats about all I liked about it. The fact that you can't pick up enemy weapons on the fly is a bummer. The controls are crappy. It feels like your fighting against the controller the whole time. The targetting reticle sucks to say the least.The game does have some merit, but like a lot of games, it's rushed out sometimes to meet a deadline, and the consumer ends up paying the price. Good idea, good story, poor execution."
2,Good Game not Great,"If you are considering getting this game because you already enjoyed Gears of War and Call of Duty 4, I would highly suggest you rent the game first. I am a big fan of CoD4 and even a bigger fan of GoW. Although I did like Army of Two I would have to say I'm a bit disappointed. On the plus side the game looks great. Campaign was fun but it felt a bit short. I like aggro and it plays well.My biggest disappointment is the online multi-player. I've played online 4 times and the lag and online game play was very very frustrating. Maybe EA can fix this with an update but until they do, I may sell this game."
2,Dont waste your $60!!!,"This game is the same thing over and over and over. Run and shoot. The graphics are great. The dialogue is horrible to say the least and the game is extremely easy. YOu can literally get shot dozens and dozens of times before you go down and then your partnet can come and revive you. I mus have played through half the game on my first go before I finally died and that was because I wanted to see what it took to finally get killed. Man I was disappointed with this crappy game. Please spend you money of COD4 if you dont already have it, if this game is worth $60, COD4 is worth $600 in comparison"
1,not happy,it took almost a week longer to get this to me and when it arrived the case was shattered in many oieces and the disk was moving all over the package. needless to say it was compleatly scratched
3,Action all over,"Army of Two certainly has a state of the art AI system and some stunning graphics, although it has some shortcomings in the storyline and multiplayer of the game. The story mode is fun but it ends a little too quickly and leaves out a few too many plot points.The online multiplayer was promising, but fell short of par. Its difficult to figure out how to do an online campaign, and the versus modes are more hype than reality. In a versus match you will see chaos everywhere and a constantly changing objective that is almost impossible to complete before it changes yet again.All in all its a fun game for a while, but quickly can become boring and old."
2,Army of Two,For a $60 game I was disappointed. Should be a $20 game. I should have waited for the price to come down.
2,Army of Two,The previews are awesome but the game play is very difficult. Just walking around is a task. I do not recommend this game. Gears of War or Call of Duty 4 are sooo much better.
3,Tremendous potential...poor followthrough,"the marketing and online play designers for this game have seriously dropped the ball on helping this game realize its potential. the campaign mode game play and dialog are rather enjoyable. sets the stage for some serious online versus play, but having to pay to download the slayer maps makes it less than desirable and the setup screens are confusing and not user friendly."
3,B-,"This game is incredibly short. 6 levels divded up into sections so u can upgrade your weapons. Of course better weapons means you work your way through the levels much faster. It does have a does have replay in it, especially if you want to upgrade all your weapons. But otherwise its just ok."
3,Middle of the Road,Game play is fine not to quirky that I was able to find without looking for bugs. Does the coop part well. The lack of depth and length of this game makes it a short one night game. In my opinion rent it or wait for a price drop.
1,bad language,The game is awesome. THe coop gameplay takes the game to a whole new level i played it and beat it several times with my friends. The Single player game is same a coop but it just isn't as fun.Although I loved the game the language was over the top. It totally ruined the game having that much cursing... i mean i can handle a little her and there but i think every cut scene had one curse word or another. I was unnessicary and took away from the game. I don't care what anyone else says there is no need to put anything like that in a video game. If I had know it was going to be like that I would not have purchasing the game.Overall the gameplay was good so if you aren't afriad of offensive language I reccomend you buy the game. I would not have bought this game for my kids given what i know now though.
5,"If you have a friend, BUY IT!","I just got this game a few days ago, I was somewhat skeptical at first because I was dumb and listened to some of the reviews (I need to stop doing that because the people who review games these days are idiots and give bad reviews to wonderful games)... anyway:This game is GREAT! It is extremely fun if you play with a friend(on the same tv, or on xbox live). I tried playing it with the computer AI but it was horrible, not any fun at all. Can't say that I have tried the multiplayer yet, but I would even say that you should buy this game just for the fun that it gives you playing it with your best bud. On top of this, it has amazing graphics and it is a third person shooter(haven't had one of those in a good while). if you are still skeptical, rent it and see if you like it. I would say the replay value is extremely high as well, and each different difficultity gives you a different taste for the game!"
4,Worth the buy,"Great 3rd person shooter. Decent plot, plenty of bad guys and they pay you to kill people. Plays alot like Gears of War, without chainsaw bayonets. Unable to play the online stuff right now so I can't say much about that, however single player and split-screen coop were enough to keep me entertained for some time. Something I'll definatly pick back up again, ESPECIALLY when I can have access to xbox live."
3,This good but expected better,"The game itself is good, although in some parts lacks emotion, that is usually very predictable, however for the price I think it's a great game and I recommend it for those who are currently released on xbox360"
5,!!!,"Fun, fast and actiony... if thats a word... if not this game got into the dictionary. The customized guns are great. The single plaer is fun and the co op is awesome. Great shooter!!! the campaign is a little short, but the details really make up for it"
2,Disapointment,"After watching the commercials on TV I thought this game looked great. However After playing it through I was very disappointed. The game didn't look to bad visually, but other than that there isn't a lot to be excited about. The thing that was very annoying was that the aiming seemed like it was unresponsive even when I put it on the highest setting. The campaign was short and I beat it in under 6 hours. The online multiplayer has an interesting concept in working co-operatively with a partner to complete various objectives, but it's hampered by the slow gameplay. If you really have your heart set on buying this game , I strongly, STRONGLY suggest renting it before hand."
5,"Great documentary, really makes you think twice","This was a really good depiction of the blood diamond scandal. It really puts things into perspective when you think about the suffering people go through to get you what, a pretty shiny rock? It is just conspicuous consumption. Even now, those in Africa who are still panning for diamonds hardly get any money for their efforts and lack the education to know the true value of any find they make. This is a very disturbing depiction of the suffering people in these countries went through, but it is something people should see as a means of education and understanding."
4,A Deeply Relational Perspective on the Trinity,"This book caused me to pause in wonder on every page. Michael Downey, in language at times poetic, sets forth a spirituality of the Holy Trinity that is intensely relational and vividly personal. His gift is taking theological abstraction and making it more accessible to the educated lay reader. This is not an easy read, but the language is so rich, it is a meditation unto itself and totally worth the time to savor each sentence. While Downey writes from an obviously Catholic perspective, several Protestant friends read it and subsequently bought their own copies.The 15 Trinitarian meditations at the end are excellent but take some time to explore."
4,Enjoyable but too solipsistic,"As an avid crossworld solver, I was glad to read this book. It's not perfect -- Romano spends far too much time on himself, and particularly on his libido; I could have done without the ""bedmate"" story and all the ogling. It makes me wonder who his target audience is. But Romano's a clever writer, and it was nice to get some insight into New York Times crossword editor Will Shortz and superstar constructor Brendan Emmett Quigley.I have a stupid nitpick. On pages 69-70, Romano writes: ""Like Judge Black's definition of pornography, you'll know these when you see them."" There are three mistakes there. One, the famous quote was by Stewart, not Black. Two, it's ""Justice,"" not ""Judge."" Three, the quote was about obscenity, not pornography. (There's a difference.) As another reviewer points out, it seems strange to see such errors in a book about people who supposedly pay such close attention to detail."
3,Who's Yer Daddy? Attitude Distracting,"Too much of this book strikes me as ""I'm a Yale man and look at how fast I can solve the NY Times Sunday puzzle!"" The author, too intelligent, apparently, to even waste his valuable time with the Monday or Tuesday NYT puzzles, reminds readers again and again of his own puzzle-solving times. On one hand, he demeans his efforts in contrast with top competitors, but on the other, we're always kept aware that his times are better than the vast majority of puzzle solvers. That said, I did enjoy the information about Will Shortz, whose puzzles I like trying on NPR and in puzzle books. Less Marc, more Will!"
1,one across: vapid,"Just add my name to the list of dissatisfied readers; for all the reasons cited in previous reviews. Of the numerous reasons to avoid this book, the most blatant is the author's odd presentation. He diverges into parenthetical, hyphenated asides that render most paragraphs nearly unintelligible. Simply put, he is verbose and unfocused. The book brims with anecdotal and philosophical musings that are unsupported, idiosyncratic and (most egregiously) unamusing. If you are looking for the equivalent of an unedited blog about Marc Romano, then this is the book for you. If you are looking for a witty, insightful or entertaining treatment of puzzles and the personalities surrounding them, look elsewhere."
2,scattered and discursive,"I fully second the reviewer who said ""Romano writes as if he had ADD."" To a tech writer like myself, this book is infuriating in its rambling disorganization. The author visited the national puzzle tournament one year as a reporter; another year as a contestant. In between he interviewed Will Shortz at his home, but we get only a few lines from that interview; and he interviewed other constructors and contestants, but we get very little of them, either. We mostly get, at great length, quite uninteresting accounts of Romano's own life and problems, or, when he's interviewing some potentially interesting person, we get Romano's feelings about that person and reactions to what that person says or looks like. Even if you, like me, are a crossword fan, this book is not worth your money."
2,"Ah, what could have been","I bought this book hoping that it would be the WORD FREAK of the crossword community. It's not. To be fair, the author states right off that the book is really about him, and boy is it ever. The author went to Yale. We know because he mentions it. A lot. The author is reading Pynchon. We know because he mentions it. A lot. The author does crossword puzzles better than 90% of people. We know because....you get the picture. Ugh.The good news is that there is still room for a well-written book about the characters that make up the crossword community, and I really hope that someone reads WORD FREAK (at least the author copped to that) and decides to use it as inspiration for a better book. This slight volume just didn't do it for me. Go get the Fastis book instead, and enjoy!"
1,You can get all this online for free,There is very little to no new information in this book that is not available online. Check out http://www.tivocommunity.com. If you are good enough to do an upgrade/hack you are good enough to find the information on your own.
3,No Longer Current,"This is exactly the same book that I purchased several years ago, despite the 2009 date info. Like it or not, the TiVo Series 1 and 2 are obsolete. I can't believe that there are absolutely no remote codes or software tweaks that are compatible with newer TiVo models. If the author and/or publisher can't find any new material for this book, what's the point?"
4,Nicely organized and easy to read,"I have not read the other tivo books yet, but I think this one is pretty good. Yes, you can get all the information online from the forums, but this book does a nice job of organizing it all in one place that you can flip through in your leisure. I found the pictures helpful too. The other reviewers seemed a bit harsh on this book, but maybe since I borrowed it from the library, I'm a bit more forgiving."
3,Reasonable Tour of Networking,"The book was well written and addresses many areas from a high level perspective. The book takes a tactic of here is the information, followed by a colored summary box telling you what was just covered; that's a nice format. The materials covered appear to be as up to date as can be expected with regards to the rapid pace of change in the IT field. Unfortunately, it's rather difficult to provide a meaningful review of the book because this is a text book within a Master's course where this particular book in inadequate to the materials and concepts required by the course. This is not reflection the book, but rather of the course. I do not recommend this book for any class other than rudimentary introduction to networking (e.g. 100-200 level)."
5,really great for a beginner!!!,This is the best book for a person who wants to gain a little overall (general) knowledge on various concepts of networking. It also lays great foundations without confusing the reader with details..
5,Best book for beginners,"Douglas know the skill to present technical information in plain english. Excellent work. The book is not cheap, but it is worth that price. If you are not a network expert, need to keep abreast of the internet/network technology but failed to or no time to do so, you need this book."
3,A good introduction for newbies...,"This is a very superficial exposure to computer networks. If you have no previous knowledge on the subject, this would be a good place to start. However, if you already know the basics and want to get your hands dirty, go get Tannenbaum's Computer Networks - there you will find everything explained in detail.One more thing about the book - in my opinion the author could have structured it much better - some chapters seem out of order. Also, as I noted above, it is a little stingy on facts..."
1,bad,it is used booked as it mentioned but it is worst..torn in between and mark with pen every page hard to read. not worth for 20$. My friend got same book but very good condition in less price as it is outdated edition. I am sorry but dont go for this!!
2,Too much prose.,"At the first time, I used this book as my reference in my networking area. But later I can not keep up this fully-prosed book anymore. At last, I had to change my reference book to another."
3,"Cursory at worst - well written at best , but used, not new.","As others have said this text is suitable for beginners, do not purchase this text if you seek detail of in-depth understanding of any specific aspect of networking. However my gripe is with Amazon, this text was used, not new when I received it. New texts don't come with Checkpoint stickers inside and a sheet of notebook paper with an ad for ""roomate wanted"" somewhere in the vicinity of Idaho State University and a phone number and e-mail address for Deb. Also Deb might want to be more careful as the back of that same sheet listed three account numbers.Obviously Deb didn't use the text long, it was in good shape and she never opened the CD but Amazon owes me a refund and explanation."
5,I wish I'd seen this book before we developed our software,"Matilda's Fantastic Cookbook Software 3.2I'm one of the developers for Matilda's Fantastic Cookbook Software. I only discovered this book after we'd built our software, but I wish I'd seen it beforehand. It's so full of ideas on how to make a family cookbook more than just a list of recipes. We came to many of the same conclusions the author did on our own, but reading her book first would've sure saved us some time.Whether you use a software package like ours to make a cookbook, or just go with a simple 3 ring binder and some hand-scrawled pages, or anywhere in between, I really recommend picking up this book and using it as a companion.I guess you could say I'm an ""expert"" in the small field of helping people make their own family cookbooks. From my research, there really isn't a better book out there for helping you get your book done."
1,Not impressed,"Maybe I didn't read the product description right, but I thought that this was going to be a customizable cookbook that I could tailor to my specific tastes. I was also thought that it might come with a cd to create fonts and designs for the cover and the interior of the book. When I got this thin little ""how to"" book I was really disappointed and even a little insulted. If I were to truly create and bind a book myself, I don't feel like I would need this little book because I would probably have enough free time on my hands to figure it out for myself. I'm returning it."
1,Don't buy,"It is described as suitable for use with portable cooler. First time I tried to use it with a portable cooler (drawing 4 Amps) the plastic in the body fitting melted from the heat that was generated internally and the plastic fused the contacts preventing it from working ever again.Would be okay for light use (cell phones, pdas etc) but don't buy if you want to use it with coolers or other heavy current devices."
4,A nice stand,Buying this to avoid cutting myself in the drawer.Maybe i would buy used one next time. it makes no difference at all actually.
3,needed more of the ponies,"This is a Regency romance. Miss Caroline Parker wants nothing more than to stay in the country and breed and train her beautiful ponies. But for rather selfish reasons of her own, her mother decides to force her into a London dubutante season in hopes she will snag a rich husband. Captain Thomas Ogden was wounded in the Napoleanic Wars. He is the heir to a bankrupt estate, and needs a wealthy wife. The two of them become friends and agree to check out each other's prospective suitors. But somehow each of them keep finding fault with any potential partners for the other. How can they find happiness when neither one has the financial means to marry the other?While the two main characters are fine, many of the supporting chaarcters are a bit on the selfish and/or unpleasant side. The book might have benefited from more scenes with the ponies, as they were quite charming."
5,Heavenly singing from a much missed soprano,"God, I miss Lucia Popp! She was a soprano with a unique gift for communicating with her audience. In this Salzburg recital, one can readily appreciate how she could infuse life into every song she sang. For this unforgetable evening she chose an inspired selection of folksongs by great composers, each and every one a gem. The 3 opera arias are exquisite."
4,Inviting Salad Set,This lovely salad set will be a great addition to any lunch or dinner setting. The serving bowl is much larger than I anticipated -- and great for tossing space. The individual bowls are also deep. This is a great set for salad lovers.
5,Excellent,"I love my new salad bowl set. The color is beautiful, so is the quality and you can't beat the price."
3,Don't judge a bowl by its cover...,"This set is aesthetically pleasing, and I was initially quite impressed with the quality. However, don't use them for anything more than extremely light use. I've owned this set for about 2 months and haven't really used it for much, but already the finish is chipping off of the spoon and one of the bowls sprung a leak between the bands of wood that it is composed of.It is a salad bowl set, and if you're only going to use it occasionally for that, and don't wash it in the dishwasher, you should be OK. Just don't put any soup in them. It's always a shame to find a product where corners were cut to save a few pennies and where a little more effort would've resulted in a great product."
4,Blower Motor for furnace and/or air conditioner,"Fasco D164 A/C Blower MotorForm, fit and function were were as expected with no problems, but there were no instructions or specs. whatsoever with it, which would have been helpful for our multi speed application."
4,Great Q&A book,"This is a great guide to support your CISSP prep.It should not be your main guide, rather it is to be used to help you assess how you are progressing in your studies."
2,Buy a Different Prep Book,"First, this isn't really a ""prep"" book. All it has are questions and answers. And the questions aren't that clear, or even based on current info. Better test questions and real prep material can be found in the Wiley CISSP Prep Guide and the Shon Harris All in One Guide."
4,Test CISSP book,THis book is very useful for preparation of CISSP exam. Received the book in good condition and i am very happy with the seller.
2,CISSP Exam Prep Book,"The Total CISSP Exam Prep Book is not a well constructed book for the purposes of studying for the CISSP exam. It lacks theory, it just provides questions and answers, with the answers right in sight of the questions. Also, are the questions even relevant for the current exam, if so then there lies a flaw within the CISSP certification process with so much of the emphasis placed on the rote memorization of test material. So even if you want to just practice by answering the questions, the answers placed where they are makes it too easy for your eyes to stray to the answers.If I would have paid the suggested retail price for this book I would have felt really, really disappointed, as it was paying a fourth of that cost I still am really disappointed."
2,"Just questions, answers and references...","If you don't need CISSP theory - this book for you, because it consist of just questions and answers with lot of references to additional books, related to questions.But if you haven't free time to check\pass\read these references lists - it's not for you, you must read some theoretical book before exam, I think. I suppose, you don't need tips, lake ""take breaks"" or something like this too."
1,Not very useful,"Some of the questions contained in this book seem to come from other sources.I also found that the questions were unclear, poorly phrased, and contained discrepancies."
1,Do not buy this,"This air filter was really sexy and cool when I bought it, but it was created with the arrogant notion (remnant of White Star Lines idea that the Titanic was unsinkable) that the filter never needs replacing. The result of this idiotic design principle was that the manufacturer never made stocked replacement filters. The device is now discontinued. If you for some reason decide to replace the filter in this unit, FORGET IT!!! You're screwed, and no you can't find a similarly sized filter anywhere else either."
3,A litte clarification...,"The title of this book isn't exacly clear as to what it contains as the text, title, and summary use 'programming' to refer to both C/C++ programming and scripting. It has a some sections on using gcc, gdb, and make, but the first 157 pages are a reference to unix CLI syntax and shell commands (like ""Unix in a Nutshell""). It would probably be good for a programmer who has never worked with Unix before. I was hoping for more of a ""Linux Programmers"" reference that covered Linux-specific nuances, libraries and devices, rather than a ""Linux for Programmers"" that shows how to use a shell and what the command line arguments are for gcc, etc... I guess the bottom line is it's not about programming, it's about scripting and the basic Linux/Unix tools that a programmer would use."
5,Great Product!,"First off, back in March when I was ordering this, Amazons ""make sher it fits"" imformational tool listed this as the wrong intake for my 2000 Acura TL 3.2. As I have shopped around, including AEM's website, I knew this was the right part. Dubble check when matching parts on Amazon, with parts from the makers website if possible. At time of this review, Amazon has fixed the missmatching issue with this part for my car.As for the intake, WOW! what an im provment! Noticable power increase, guessing 10 to 15 hp, iv monitored 3 to 5 mpg increase, and an awsome sound that roars when you hit the throttle, but is still calm and quite when rolling though neiborhood streets. I love this intake!"
5,Memory lane,Great memory prompts for wonderful remembrances.Stories are fun and have messages as well.A must read for former campers and an inspiration for aspiring campers.
5,Great cookies bad seller!,These cookies are incredible but Plow and Hearth doesn't have them. It took them a week to tell me they were out of stock and cancel my order altogether. Since they were for a gift I was not pleased. The cookies are fantastic just order them from someone else!
1,calculator purchase,Not a very good product. The clock will not stay set after numerous attempts at setting it. Have already replaced it.
3,Talking calculator could be better,"This talking calculator is adequate, but it gives numbers using the word thousand(s), which is annoying and distracting. Just the digits would be better, as it was on the calculator that had to be replaced. The numbers have to be pressed very firmly, and the low is too low and the high is higher than necessary."
1,Awful. Seriously awful.,"A memoir deconstructing a young man's response to his mother's death makes for worthy subject matter, certainly. But The Loss is so poorly written, so desperately in need of developmental and technical editing that it's simply unreadable. A drink, on me, for anyone who can give me an accurate exclamation-point count on the book. 'Cause there's a freakin lot of them! Admittedly, I did enjoy the book. Once. That is to say, one night, my friends and I (mostly attorneys, all of us would probably fall into the ""semi-intellectual"" category) were all stoned and I read a couple passages aloud and we loved it. But except to be used like that, you know, to get a few yucks and feel superior by mocking others' work, which is just mean, the book is just dreadful. In fact, I have to believe that those giving good reviews are friends or family members of the writer. They just have to be. Beware the self-pub'ed book!"
5,Just Buy The Loss,"The Loss is a well structured book charged with unequeled love and grief for a mother. Wenedels' writing is pure and honest with all who appear on the pages, including himself. He does not hide from the retelling of moments a lesser man would rather forget. Courage is required in such stories. The end result is a picture of a young man and his mother who are perfectly and wonderfully human. Honesty brought to the pages is a rare and wonderful thing to find when writers embrace topics of a personal nature. Wendels embodies that honesty.An eye should remain open for Wendels' name for he will go far."
4,I really enjoyed this book,"I really enjoyed reading this book. It was really easy to follow, considering it is constantly backwards and forwards from the present to the history, but without it being superficial.It's a very personal story, but due to the subject matter, I think just about anyone can relate to this. You can empathise with the writer, without actually feeling alienated as someone who doesn't know the writer or his background.It's a great insight into one person's loss, that all of us will have experienced at least once, in some form, in our lives.Well worth a look"
4,Good Product,"The only negative thing I can find to say is that the taste is awful. Directions say to mix 2 teaspoons with small amount of warm water (about 2 shot glasses). I did feel that I had more energy, however I have to find a more palatable product as this is hard for me to swallow because of the taste."
4,Move up to America's Finest,"Bill Staton shows you how to say goodbye to the fund managers that cost you money each time they buy and sell in your mutual fund. Buy your own good stocks and hold them forever as Warren Buffett would tell you to do. Balance your portfolio each time you buy using Bill Staton's guidelines. A child can use this method, and Bill shows this it in some of his examples. Buy it and prosper."
3,Disappointed,"Well the order took a few days to get here when I paid for two day delivery, and then when I recieves my order it wasn't the right color, I ordered a bright blue, but I recieved a dark navy blue instead. I'm dissappointed about that aspect of it but my nephew loves it either way"
1,Smells like a Chemical Factory,"I bought this thing at the airport thinking it would help me sleep on the plane. I had to keep it in its plastic bag and under a jacket in order to block out the smell. It is completely nauseating. I left it on my hotel balcony for five days during my trip, but it still smelled the same on my return flight. Stay away!!!"
1,Squishy pillow,Pillow was delivered promptly in good order. The pillow had a strange smell to it. It was almost like a fuel smell. I returned the pillow and am awaiting refund.
3,blah!,"I should have listened to the review that said this was kinda of on the smaller side. It's not what I was expecting and the quality is not that great. I was really hoping for something to replace my Mogu pillow, but it's no comparison. Buy if you have no expectations."
5,Excellent quality,"This replaced a worn out pillow for my son, and in comparison this is suburb! Very light, very squishy, yet maintains shape. Happily pleased."
5,Very pretty and functional,"The package was mailed promptly, was properly wrapped, and is very funtional for its intended purposes."
4,Impressive packaging,"I was looking for a replacement for the squish pillow I purchased from Brookstone, who doesn't seem to sell them any longer. The pillow isn't quite the quality of my original, but I am sure I will get used to it. There is always an adjustment to a new pillow. The impressive part was the packaging. The pillows were very neatly wrapped in tissue paper and there was a hand written note inside. I will definitely look for more products sold by this company. They obviously care about their products. I hope Amazon will be able to sell these again."
3,cushie pillow,"Arrived quickly, price was a little high. The pillow is shorter and over stuffed for me. Not very comfortable on the neck."
4,Happy with Purchase,I have had micro bead pillows before but they are geting more difficult to find. When the ad came for these I could not pass it up. I'm very satisfied with the quality of construction and comfort of this item. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a comfortable pillow to cuddle up with
3,Body of Work cds,"I liked it. However, many songs in the 2 CDs were the same ones I already own on two other CDs. But I still found this album very nice. I just wish this album had songs I never heard of."
4,Review #4,"Great to find the 12"" of ""Join In The Chant."" Unfortunately, no 12"" of ""Let Your Body Learn."""
1,Not a good book for practical nursing,This book is one of my text books for practial nursing. It has been very frustrating to read. The information is not always clear. I have to find other books that will help me to understand the information.
3,Ok,In all honesty I'm just not that impressed with this book. It is required text for one of my classes and I will use it in 2 others as well. It's just not very engaging to me.
3,3-1/2 Stars?,"I just completed an A&P; class using this book. I think this book is a nightmare for an attention-deficit person. The pages are incredibly ""busy"" and it is hard to focus on the concepts being presented. On the other hand, the illustrations and charts are good and helpful (maybe they just need a visually better layout). I found myself having to read, re-read, and map out the information myself differently because for me it was not presented in a clear way.The CD rom that comes with this is helpful to quiz yourself. The student workbook is tedious in that it simply reprints all the diagrams in the book and has you color and label them. After I did the first chapter I was thoroughly fed up with it. Labeling: helpful. Coloring for 2 hours: not helpful."
3,a book for rainy days,"This book is basically about several people telling how their decision to convert to Judaism came about and what they actually experienced compared to what they expected.It is light, easy reading - nothing complicated.The reason I gave it only 3 stars is because I feel that it lacks enthusiasm. It has a tendency to be a little dry.If you're looking for basic info on Judaism,look elsewhere. But if you're looking for a book to curl up with on a rainy day,this may be just what you're looking for -a low key easy read.It does have a small glossery of some Jewish words but nothing that you couldn't find elsewhere.It would perhaps make a nice gift but again,the excitement or enthusiasm of a new convert is just not conveyed.Forgiving that one point,it is in general a good book that I would buy again."
5,Choosing Judaism is for everyone!,"This was a very fast reading book. I enjoyed the writes style. I found several things very interesting. I was shocked to see the writing indicating that it was 'okay to celebrate xtain holidays""... From my stand point, I've come out of the church and I do not want others sinning in the false belief factors. It is very hard to tell family that you can no longer partake in their holidays. The writer did indicate that 'your not partaking', but I have to beg to differ and say, if you eating, you partaking. There are many other days to get together with family, I.E. Thanksgiving. And for children to see both Jewish and church holidays is very confusing. We then wonder ""where did assimilation come from?""The book was good, I have already recommended it to friends."
1,Stopped Working After 1-Year,My light stopped working after a year.Seems Princeton-Tec doesn't sell/service this light anymore so now I have a $300 paper weight
3,There are better groups,"The Salty Dogs played traditional jazz, reviving old tunes, mainly from the '20's. They were competent enough, but Turk Murphy and his groups were a lot better."
5,Superb piano pieces and performance,"Blumenfeld is not very well known, but his piano pieces are incredibly beautiful. They are played with sensitivity and emotional impact on this nicely mastered CD. A must for piano buffs."
5,My son loves this,My son is 5 years old and he loves this CD. He will gladly play quietly for hours as long as he can listen to Gene Kelly tell him stories. These are classic fairy tales all brought to life through song and acting by the great Gene Kelly. Every kid should have this CD.
3,Useful,The author is very detailed to the point of taking 20 pages to convey an idea that could easily have been done in 2 or 3 pages. So the main points are helpful and interesting and they are underlined and that was useful.
5,Real eye opener !,"I really liked the background into the why we have pain. This book will draw you one step closer to GOD our heavenly father. And how much loves HIS creation.Our reward is in heaven, if we hold firm, and trust in HIM."
3,Where Is God When It Hurts,"It's okayI found this book to be very deep, spiritually andheart warming in certain topics.I recommend reading"
5,Amazing,Great book. Answers many questions and many questions are made. Good book to have or use to reference during hardships.
3,Short book,"Didn't realize it was this short of a book. Not sure what I was looking for when choosing this book, but it was just okay."
4,Good book,This book has some real nice articles that will help if you are hurting and need that extra boost of faith to get through the day
2,Not what I expected in a book like that.,I wasn't looking for a text book but one that was easier to read. It was too much like a selfhelp book and that didn't interest me. I will get that in my church from my pastor.
3,It's okay,"Philip Yancey takes a while to get into the meat of the question that represents the title. I found it a little ""boring"" at the beginning."
3,Great book poor condition,"The book itself is great. Love the questions for a study group or just private ruminations in the back. But it was supposed to be new, but obviously was not. Dog earred pages, bent up cover, but I got it at such a good price and really loved the questions in back, that I kept it anyway. So I would recommend this book, just not this subseller."
4,"where is god when you need him,,,,,","I found ""WHERE IS GOD WHEN YOU NEED HIM"",,,very interesting and thought provoking,, i could read this book again,, and loved it on kindle,,"
5,Amazon you rock,"This book was being given away free on amazon for a time and even if it weren't it is a worthy read! One of my pastors commented on facebook that this was one of his favorite books, and that he recommended it for everyone. I've been going thru a tough season and I think really spending time seeing the questions answered that are brought up in this book is good self-care and self-love. God is big enough to handle any question we have and He is kind and gentle to meet us in our doubts and pain without shame and without condemnation. He cares too much for that to be His approach. Anyway, go for it!"
4,Interesting Book,This is an interesting book because it approaches the issue of physical pain and suffering in several different ways. I especially like that he focuses on what we can DO to be helpful to those in pain. It talks about pain theoretically and practically and from a specifically Christian point of view.
2,Disappointing,"I do not feel that it gets to the point quick enough, found it rather boring. Does not hold your attention."
2,Did not like it,Expected something else.Did not complete the book.Not my kind of book.Like metaphysical books.Like something that teaches me how to live.
5,A Must Read for All Ages,"Adversity is a part of mortal life; this book helps you deal with it and successfully adjust, no matter what your adversity happens to be."
4,Excellent,I have never been disappointed with a Philip Yancey book - this book is a blessing! I would recommend it to anyone dealing with hurt.
3,way too long,there is a ministry at church that works with people who are in crisis and a lot of them are in pain. this book takes a stab at it but is too wordy. distill it please.
3,Good info,Great for dealing with physical pain. I deal with emotional hurts so not as meaningful to me at this time.
4,Challenging,I am taking this book at a slower pace as is more intense and intellectually written - certainly not a quick read but gives me tons to consider
3,Very thought provoking book,"This book was not an easy read, but The book was very good . . The stories were very helpful examples.This book helps you decide the answers for yourself and also in a group discussion."
5,Another great book.,Excellent book. Very interesting approach to the value of physical pain. Helpful to anyone suffering prolonged illness or tragedy in their life.
5,Where is God When it Hurts,Phillip Yancey has a wonderful way of describing God's intervention in our lives when we hurt the most. Those events draw us closer to God if we acknowledge His presence and following His leading. Good book.
4,Bird II,Interesting take on pain. Answering the question why would God let us feel pain. A book worth reading to help you with why God allows pain.
1,Not for me. Literally.,Someone found my Kindle and has been downloading some books to it. This is one of them. I wish I had my Kindle back. :(
2,Simple-minded,"At the outset I have to confess that I haven't read this book in its entirety. However, there was enough stupidity in the few excerpts that I did read to incline me not to want to read further. In discussing ""the problem of pain"", the author wonders aloud why no one discusses ""the problem of pleasure"". Huh?? Does such a problem really exist? Assuming that God is Good, then pleasure is consistent with His Goodness, and doesn't cry out for an explanation. He comments elsewhere that they only make ""get-well"" cards for sick people. Is this really a trenchant insight? I suppose they should make ""stay sick"" cards for them, or ""I hope you're enjoying the vomiting and chills"". Give me a break."
1,Where is god......nowhere to be found,"Christians once again launch into a tirade of rationalizations for the the presence of ""god"" at ground zero. I'm tired of godists who pretend that the help they recieve from other people is the presence of""god"". Zero stars"
4,Where is God it hurts,"I wanted to read more, of this type of book. It was good to read what I thought I allready knew."
5,new ways of looking at coping,This is another excellent example of why Philip Yancey is worth while reading. He always brings a new common sense slant on successful living.
3,"Depressing, not comforting","The topic of pain is a difficult one and the book was tough to read. Rather than finding comfort, I found it depressing and it gave me nightmares. I did finish it thinking perhaps the conclusion would make it worthwhile. Sadly, not so."
5,AMAZING,This book is brilliance at its best and it reminds us that pain is actually good for us because it tells us that something is wrong with our bodies.
3,Book # 2,Isn't exactly what I thought it was. I'm skipping some of the chapters as I'm losing interest. Not sure if I'd recommend it to anyone
3,"Great start, but then seemed repative","I thought the book started out great and I even recommended it to others, but it seemed to be saying the same things as I got more into it. Another reader felt the same way. Great concept and idea and it makes sense as to what he writes, it just got to be a little much after 5 chapters."
4,Helpful discussion,"Yancy addresses key question that those who face difficulties often ask. He has given me much to think about as I consider ways I, too, might be helpful to people walking through a journey of pain.The book seems to be written from the experience of Yancy's own wrestling with difficult and big questions of life."
3,Why did I pick this up?,"I thought it was sometimes repetitive. I guess the subject is just a downer, it was, however, a well written piece."
1,Ehhh,I don't know. This book was strange for me. It was too eclectic and didn't have the more traditional prayers that I was searching for. Returned it.
3,"Beautiful narration, too much music","I really enjoy listening to these, however I often find myself concentrating more on the music than the word. Right now the music is playing in my head. I wish there were some way to hear the narration without the music. I asked Broadman & Holman if they had an HCSB audio Bible without the music, but they don't at this time. It's really good, but I have to try hard to listen to the words instead of the music. It is such peaceful music that you get caught up in it instead of the speech. If it weren't for the music, or if the music could somehow be turned off, I'd give this audio Bible 5 stars."
4,Swing to freedom,"this is a very nice item for the older collectors, i would not buy this with intent to give to a child. The ""Silver Anniversary"" series (especially this one) wont look great out of the box, the rope attached to Luke wont be on a rafter and it will look strange."
1,OMG its 2003 get with it,"From the get go, this game really stinks. First of all we had to take this game back TWO times to get a working version. Finally we got one that worked. After the install it was very boring and very cliche.Problems:--Its the same Scenery or 'tiles' for the whole entire level your on, like they just copied and pasted all the hallways, objects etc.--AI is horrible--You CANNOT lean! sorry you must play like your a box, most FPS especially MPs have this function, why run around a dangerous corner when you can peek, why walk out in the open when you can lean out from some cover? Bad badYou can best sum this game up by digging up some very low budget and ancient FPS and give a little- and I mean little better graphics and there you have this game. Dont waste your money on this one guys.I enjoy Battlefield 1942, SOF1, SOF2, HalfLife - Chaser does not even come close to enjoyment. Save your money or wait a few weeks for this one to go into the bargain bin."
4,good game!,"Single player is very good thou you have to quick save alot to advance through the game. Multiplayer needs some patching for all the lag problems,but still is very fun when you dont get connection probs. Overall a pleasent surprise for a game bought just for something new to play til halflife 2 comes out."
2,problem with computer,must maybe buy video card power not cheap video wont work in play not open it sorry me can't to know not play it.
1,non functional piece of garbage!,"Crap game, doesnt work on xp, vista or windows seven , it wont even allow you to download the game just gives a error message about the memory. apparently this is an ongoing issue which has no support to fix it because the company went belly up."
3,Not for the intermediatary,"I can't figure out why my previous writing hasn't been posted yet. btw if you expect some decent overview of whole theoretical structure of Giddens's, you should skip this book. this book is mere recapping of Giddens's major titles. sure there are somewhat short assessment on the final chapter. but from my view, it's not fair judgment and worse not insightful at all thou some points are worth reading thou with no supporting. the only merit is the list of all Giddens's work including his journal paper and other's on Giddens"
3,STINKS UP THE HOUSE!,WHOEVER SAID THAT THIS THING DOESN'T STENCH UP THE PLACE MUST BE LIVING IN A GREASE MONKEY GARAGE SHOP. SWHEW!!CUT THE FAT. STAY AWAY FROM THESE FRYERS!!
5,Love this fryer!,"This fryer is unbelievable, plenty of capacity, easy to clean, easy to use and a dream to have. I would recommend it to everyone."
1,374 heat,"Looked for a time to find a deep fryer like this. Mine doesn't get to 374 degrees. I wanted it for fried apple pies but, it dosen't get hot enough."
1,awkward .....Food Not Crispy,"I recently purchased this fryer from a club store.I did every thing according to the book, the fryer light out when oil at set temp.,used Name brand french fries,.........Soggy! Left nextbatch in 5 min. longer(doubled the time) crispy but GREASY!!(used mazola corn oil)Tried various products hoping this thing would some how start working NOT .It also has a awkward, dangerous style lid,I do not recommend!What attracted me to this fryer was its capacity and the ease of cleaning, and that it is , but that's all."
5,Outstanding introductory surgical text,"I am a graduating senior medical student, and I happened to come upon this text quite by accident. Intending only to browse it for the moment, I found the text to be captivating. The author gives a clear and concise overview of every major surgical topic in a way that is approachable and easily understandible. The tables and figures nicely complement the ""high yield"" text. I only wish I had this text when I did my surgical clerkship."
2,dim as a rock,"The light rock works well. Be forewarned it is useful as a marker but dosn't light up anything,"
3,Not for long time service!,"Intially lights work great, stay lit most of the night! But after a couple of months they start to fail? Light falls out or they cannot handle the rain!I am done with this product, having purchased 10 of these, with 8 still in use!"
3,NOT AS GOOD AS THEIR FIRST ALBUM!!!,"This album is a good album. But it is not as good as their first album. The songs on this album begin to sound the same after a while, almost sounds like the same guitar sound in every song. I'm a little disappointed, but this is still a pretty good album to get."
3,Too similar to their debut offering to make any waves.,"Pissing Razors impressed the Metal World with their debut and felt they had to put it out again. I love their sound so I did give it 3 stars and it does have some high points. If you have never heard this band I recommend this CD, if you have the first and really, really love it get this CD, if you have their first and aren't a huge fan of that; stay away from Cast Down the Plague. this band is a couple of steps away from being on the 'metal map'"
4,mistake number 1........,"I just bought this a few weeks after i bought the first album, and i thought the debut was much better. It seems like they put more time and effort into their debut. This is still a great album, and i would probably give it 4 1/2 stars, but i was a little disapointed that they didnt have another ""sounds of doom"" type song or a little rapping in a song like the first album. But pissing razors will be pissing razors, maybe the third album will be a little better."
4,A Tale Of Two Wars,"This book uses an oral history format to tell the story of the first African-American military pilots in the segregated US Military during World War II. The author, John B. Holway, very effectively, sorted and edited the words of these courageous men to tell their story through their own voices. Their personalities come through as they related their thoughts, emotions, experiences, idiosyncrasies, and dramatic and minute details of their lives. These men fought valiantly and distinguished themselves fighting two wars - one for the world as American patriots and one for social justice against racial segregation and bigotry. Their story is an important one as a shining example of human beings making progress to advance themselves and teach us all to continue to become better individuals and better as a nation."
4,Definately a Mary Gentle Fan,"This novel, the third in the Book of Ash, is really a terrific read. Mary Gentle's narrative is at once visceral and vivid. This series is refreshingly straight foward and yet filled with enough twists and climatic action that I found it an irresistable page turner.For those who have read the prior two novels, the answers to many burning cliff hangers lie within: What is the fate of the remaining Lion Azure? What are the sinister goals of the Ferae Natura Machinae? Why do they seek the destruction of Burgandy? How did Ash come to be among the Griffin-in-Gold?The mix of the emails of the future historians and archaeologists just adds enough of hint to not only what is to come, but how and why...I've already pre-ordered ""Lost Burgandy"" and can hardly wait..."
4,Nice massager for the elderly,I spent a lot of time looking for a massager for my parents who are over 80 years old. I am glad I made the right decision. My parents told me they use this massager every day and feel comfortable with it.
3,"Great option, but too strong","I love this thing, but it can be a little too much for wider calves. I usually just rest the bottoms of my feet on top."
3,Was not the color shown in the picture,"When I received the item, was so dissapointed that the picture does not reflect the true colors of the sheet."
5,"Sexy, Steamy and Funny.....","I missed this off Broadway show in New York and was very happy to see that it made it to video. A great and talented cast, (in many areas). This show has a lot to offer. BUY IT!! You WON'T regret it!"
4,Just Completely Fantastic,"This was a fantastic video! It was very entertaining. Had very nice looking guys, good setting. Nicely done. Unfortunately there were no erections and of course no ejaculation. It was very clean soft porn but very much worth watching. The behind the scenes were VERY DISAPPOINTING, there was no nudity and when they did show nudity it was blotted out! So expect nudity only in the main video and that is all. Don't expect anything special after that. I am always disappointed in videos that refuse to show any erections."
1,Nothing to see,"Their gimmick is that they're naked. That's it. The songs are lame too. Ok, the song ""Nothing but the Radio on"" is clever, but that's only a couple of minutes in an entire show. Really not worth buying or even renting."
3,"Well, I don't TOTALLY regret buying this...","This film does indeed deliver what its' title says. It is an amalgam of men (not the off-putting ""boys"") singing mostly clever songs in mostly adequate voices. The guys are cute and unself-conscious, but lack a certain genuine connection at many points of the show. Some were misused in certain numbers. Attractive guy+ Good voice doesn't automatically = a good casting fit. I liked this DVD overall, and recommend it ...ultimately."
5,Broadening Visual Boundaries,"Surprisingly, muscular bodies of average-sized males equipped with nice voices delivering a funny entertaining full-Monty musical.As most musicals, it consists of a number of scenes barely joint contextually but with nudity performers demonstrate, dresses on in off instantly.Making the performance doco introduces actors involved closer and materializes obstacles dealing with same sex passion on-scene-playing by respectful fathering married men.It was a hit in NYC at the time while over a passage of time this DVD presents not less $114 ticket could do a reviewer had saved on this work highly recommended for teen girls 15+."
2,Not my thing,"I admit I was tempted by the title. Naked boys! And they sing! Well...After 10 minutes I realized that I was not the target audience of this film.First and foremost the eye catcher of this title, the naked boys, wears off quickly...Unless you are a desperate, who hasn't seen a naked man for a while.Otherwise, the view of 10 men jumping naked on a stage becomes slightly idiotic after two or three songs (and I think it was the last thing the director had in mind).What's more...It is a musical (kind of), so there are no spoken dialogues, thus the film is really hard to digest (if you are not a fan of this kind of movies).I give the second star for the song about a naked maid :)"
5,Please create audio abridged version,"To the publisher I would appreciate it if the publisher could produce an audio adaptation of this book. I would love to listen to this while I drive to work and to let my 16 month old son listen to it as a bedtime story. My goal is to expose him to some of my favorite passions, maths, sciences, physics, geophysics, paleontology, astronomy, electronics, photonics, new science and discoveries etc. The more audio books you can produce of the above genre the more I will support you. Arnold D Veness"
4,Great book,"This is a great book for boys. It not only focused on the biological/physical changes in a boys body during puberty, but also addressed the psychological and emotional issues of dating and relationships. I liked the analogy between sharks and dolphins. A must for parents who are too embarassed to discuss sex education with their kids. It is a way to approach the subject."
1,1/2 STAR,"It holds the phone so it gets 1/2 star for that. The minus 4 1/2 is because you can't hear the phone RING in this holder. I can hear my phone ring in the next room without the holder. It is so muted in this thing, that on my belt I cannot hear it in normal conversation. Both front and back are solid and the sides are heavy elastic. Very well made and sturdy enough to protect your phone......but you need to hear it ring."
2,"Dead material, too much of too little, but good overview.","Book suffers from the ""lets try to cover it all in one book"" syndrome. So you get too much of too little plus a lot of good space is wasted discussing things nobody uses. Lack of the ability to cut in the copyediting room. Great for an overview of major web development tools. Not great on getting a practical overall picture of what works and what does not with each tool. You could easily waste time using the wrong stuff."
5,One of the Best Books on Sales,"This book is sweet. I learned a ton about sales, and guess what in all my sales positions I was able to apply what this book talks about. It's very comprehensive and teaches you what only the best sales organizations are going to take the time to teach you. I recommend this book to anyone who is in sales or thinking about getting into sales."
1,TOTAL WASTE,"No value here, waste of a lot of $. There are good books out there on selling, this is not one of them. All hype, all slick and no substance. The author is trying to sell himself, not offer wisdom. The co-author is his wife who has no education or expertise. A rip-off."
5,Beautiful,"These are wonderful coasters! Sturdy, but just absolutely beautiful. If you love the Last Stand photo, this is a beautiful rendition!"
5,Great shoe!,One of the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn. Perfect for a casual Saturday. I want some more different colors. They are great.
4,Let's grow kindness,"In Goldfish and Chrysanthemums, Andrea Cheng tells a sweet story of a Chinese American girl who creates a make shift backyard goldfish pond in love for her grandmother who received a letter telling her that her father's old house in Suzhou city in Jiangsu Province had been torn down. The illustrations aren't my favorite, but the story is one so sweet that this book is one I love to read. I love reading about how a child can show love and bring healing to someone else. Use it to talk about how we can show love to each other particularly when someone is hurting. Who knows what project may evolve out of reading this one with your children...If you want to read my reviews of 35 children's books having to do with China, visit my 7/2/2012 post on myoverthinking(dot)com"
2,Book,"Got this for my husband because he loved the movie, and I thought he would enjoy reading the book also. It arrived in very poor shape though, the pages were ripped and the whole book itself was all bent up."
4,Great for the price!,"Great car charger for the price. The cord could be a little longer, but other than that I'm very glad I bought it."
2,Worked fine until it died an early death,"Basically the charger did what it was supposed to do until it died after 4 months. I can't say that I am terribly suprised given the price and the fact that it seems to run hot but it would have been nice to get at least a year out of it. In fairness, the second one I purchased at the same time for my wife still seems to be working fine."
4,Works depending on what you need it for,"This product worked well for me. I had none of the jittery side effects, but there was a little bloating. I have a problem with ""elimination"" & have taken Amitizia for it, which had me extremely sleepy when I took my 2nd dose at night & had me feeling HORRIBLY bloated. With this product, I do have fewer cravings & use the restroom every morning. I never feel really hungry, but since I know the importance of eating regularly, whenever I do eat I discover that I really was pretty hungry. All in all, I would say this is worth the money. I purchased this product by accident when I was really looking for the Ultimate Diet Cleanse. I can't wait to try that one, too."
1,Don't bother,"This product is not worth your time or money. The pills are large, smelly, and hard to swallow. Once you finally get them down, it gets worse. They made me jittery, dizzy, and nauseous. I would feel terrible the entire day. I used the pills precisely as instructed until I had (almost) finished the bottles (couldn't get those last ones down!). I did not lose any weight, but even if I did, it would not have been worth it."
3,Nature's Secret Ultimate Weight Loss,"Shipment came promptly. However, I thought Softgels were soft? I am getting regular tablets when I thought I ordered Softgels. Haven't started to lose weight yet but I am sure it will come."
2,Another useless gadget to fritter away my money on,"It's not ultra-thin, it doesn't always stay on the surface you want it on, and the decals start to peel, making it look really cheap.It transformed my life in one way: I understood that I spent too much money on junk when I was buying more junk to manage the junk I already had."
2,Book required for my class,"The book was a great reference for my college course. Although it was an older publication, it still served its purpose."
2,Nothing new here,"I bought this book thinking that it would offer some new insights on health and diet. It ended up being far from it and it's just the same old stuff that's been written elsewhere. Get some exercise, eat more fruit and veggies and cut way back on the sugars/refined carbs. There, I just saved you the cost of this book. He suggests a Mediterranean diet and lifestyle that has grains at the bottom of its food pyramid. I could be wrong, but I'm thinking that stone age humans didn't eat much grain, but that's what's at the bottom of the pyramid and what your are supposed to eat the most of. He uses the research of Alan Keys, research that was nicely discredited by Gary Taubes in his MUCH better and more scientifically researched book ""Good Calories, Bad Calories"", to demonize saturated fat. Don't waste your time on this one."
3,Good Information,I learned something from this book although it was a lot of the same information published in other books.
1,What Happened to My Last Review?,"Hmmm...I had a review written for this book previously which was up for quite some time and has mysteriously disappeared. And oddly mine was the only one that didn't give it 5 stars. Hmm...mighty odd.Here's a brief synopsis of this book: it's a waste of your time and is a farce trying to masquerade as a ""Stone Age Diet."" Research from scientists such as Weston A. Price and Dr. Loren Cordain disprove nearly every point Goscienski makes. He has a few good points, but you'll find them elsewhere. Avoid this book."
3,"Great ideas, but...","The music was one of the main reasons why I went to see ""Entrapment"" over and over again in a movie theatre with a good audio system. The piano score (as on track 3) is indeed a beautiful work of art. Therefore, I obtained the soundtrack CD, expecting quite a lot of it. However, I was quite disappointed to find out that the music of the film was not composed - or at least not included on CD - in more length than was present in the final cut. Brilliant ideas are chopped to tracks that are about a minute and a half long, first impressing you, then letting you down as everything ends abruptly. The result is not really a complete album - it is like a musician's scratch book - full of sequences of notes that never made it into a complete song. Don't get me wrong - this has its moments, but they are way too brief to be completely enjoyable."
4,One of the greatest.,"You'll see, when you sit down and listen to the soundtrack for the first time you'll love it. I admit it is a bit short but when you listen to track number 3 you'll understand why it is such a beautiful soundtrack. I would recommend this soundtrack to anyone who is a contemporary classical fanatic."
2,Fairly disapointing,"After I saw this movie, and heard the music there, I was eager to purchase the soundtrack (Too eager, I paid more to purchase it at the music store than here at Amazon). But when I got it I was disapointed. The music that I had remembered hearing, and liking so much, was barely on it (Just tracks #18 and 20, and scattered various other places), and a lot of the music was themeatic, and not as good apart from the movie as it was in the movie. There is a lot of variety to the tracks though, as well as a wide number of internationial sounding tracks. So I don't know if I'd recomend against getting it, but just know that it's not a beautiful score, and I personally was disapointed with it. But others may (And obviously do) like it. One note, the last part of track #20 is one of the most annoying pieces of noise I've heard on a soundtrack. Definitely skip past that when you get there. Coulda' been better, coulda' been worse. Two Stars, maybe two and a half."
3,Captures the feel of the movie,"The Entrapment soundtrack captures (of course!) the feel of the movie. Somehow the action and romance of the movie did not quite carry over when I listened to just the music. For devoted fans of the movie, consider this album. For others, listen to a few samples before you decide."
3,"Great Ingredients, but........","I bought this food since it is very difficult to provide my cat with a variety of food due to all of her allergies. I was excited to find this food. Not only are the ingredients high in quality, but they are allergy free. The bad part is that my cat just won't eat it and she is not a fussy eater. The food is very dry (even when soaked in water), even the canned food is void of any gravy. This food may be better suited for dogs than cats. I'll have to wait for Natural Balance to straighten out the recall issues and rely on Wellness until then."
3,"A good reference, but...","This is a wonderful reference book, but...It includes a huge number of chart types and patterns and absolutly no information about them. There are no pointers to information about what the charts mean or even where to start to find it. I've read through a good number of Technical Analysis books so most of the charts make sense but some make no sense. Especially the Gann charts. Maybe I've been reading the wrong books, but I've yet to find book that describes Gann time and price projection properly. You can't show so many charts without giving us a hint about where to look for more information.I normally really like Constance Brown's books. ""All About Technical Analysis"" and ""Technical Analysis for the Trading Professional"" are both wonderful books. But this one is just a reference book that is useful to professional traders as a communication reference, but it is useless as a learning tool."
4,Fabulous Forties,"The forties were fascinating years in the history of fashion, and Tom Tierney has captured them beautifully with this book. The abrupt change from wartime to the New Look is well depicted.I especially loved the inclusion of the WAC and Navy Nurse Corps uniforms.My reason for not rating this book a full 5 stars is that the 3 outfits by Dior have been inaccurately drawn (I'm a huge Dior fan, so I am familiar with photos of his designs). Also, Dior introduced the layered tulle ballgown in the spring 1947 collection, a design that had a huge impact on evening wear for the following decade, yet this type of gown is not included in this work."
5,I loved this book,"I love the paper dolls, I was specifically looking for the paper dolls for Adrian, hey that's an idea, just publish one for Adrian. The few there were great, I'd buy it again...."
3,"Great for people who know Perth/Fremantle, Australia.","21.5 x 23 cm, 182 pages, black and quite photographs. Fremantle Arts Centre Press.I'm very surprised to see this book appear in Amazon's catalog. The book contains many black and white photographs of Perth, Fremantle and other areas in Western Australia from days of old (long before I was born) and hence this book appealed to me, so that I had a record of what my home city was like before I was born. From that point of view, the book is certainly very adequate and recommended, although I suspect it would have very limited appeal to anyone who is not familiar with Perth, Australia."
4,Comes Up A Little Short,"The product works as advertised. The LED solid on or flashing makes it easier to see the dog in an off leash environment. When walking on the street, my experiences are mixed. I think that has more to do with drivers paying attention than the product. The light is difficult to see if the dog is heading straight for you or away from you. It is very clear from a side view of the dog. The only disappointing issue is the measurement. The medium collar states that it is 18 inches long. However that includes the total clip, one inch of which snaps into the clip making it 17 inches long. Had I known that I might have opted for the larger size. With the dog's winter coat, she has a lot of hair around the neck which tends to overlap the collar making it a little difficult to see as she moves around. Without her winter coat the collar length should be fine."
4,"Do not use as the primary collar, But Great for lighting","I bought two in large. One for a 98 pound German Shepherd and another for a 80 pound Ridge-Back.The light is provided by a flexible clear plastic cable looking gizmo that makes the entire collar appear to glow. It is not super bright, but they really stand out during a dark evening... It makes your dog easy to spot when they run off into the woods and it helps cars to see us during our evening walks. HOWEVER, they do not hold the size adjustment. If you try using it as the only collar, any jerking against the leash will open up the collar and the dog will slip right out. Plus the section that looks like it might also be reflective is not..."
5,These are Great Collars,"I have used these collars for years. They are very well made, very bright, easy to turn on and off and easy to put on the dog."
4,Nice to have for the night time walks,"I bought this for night time walks. Now that we are into the winter season, it gets dark early, so this is a handy light. You can use it as a regular color, but I have it loose enough to simply slip over the dog's head. It can be a steady light or flashing. I hooked a Nite Ize LED on the color ring for added light. Sometmes I let the dog run off the collar and I can see where she's at, which is usually in the woods looking for rabbits."
5,THUMBS UP,"I LIVE IN THE COUNTRY SO WHEN THE DOGS GO OUTSIDE AT NIGHT I JUST PUSH THAT LITTLE BUTTON AND THE COLLARS GLOW, NOW I CAN SEE WHERE THIER AT. THE COLLARS DO FIT TRUE TO SIZE."
4,"Battery pack came off, but quick and easy replacement","The battery pack fell out of the collar within the first month on a walk and I didn't notice. I thought this would be a more cost-effective product than the blinking collar charms since the battery can be replaced.***Update*** It's only 2 days after returning the product and I already received the replacement - they didn't even wait until mine was received back. So, what may have been lacking in the quality of that particular collar was made up in awesome customer service. I simply wrapped some masking tape around the new one (just the battery case part) to ensure it won't come off again. My dog loves to roll in the snow so I'm sure that's how it came off. So, am a happy night-time dog walker again. Thanks!"
2,Battery Life is bad!,"We have only used the collar for a little over a month, once a day for about 30 min. each time, and the battery is now dead! I would have expected a little longer life than this."
4,"Very visible, but a little troublesome to straighten out","This collar illuminates very nicely and is visible from very far away. The only irritating thing about it is that they package the glow tube in a back and forth kinked position, which means that it doesn't run smoothly around your dog's neck. This is a solvable problem by heating the tube (used a hair dryer for a while); but it would be better if this wasn't necessary or they at least provided some instructions on straightening it."
2,"Decent Quality, Odd Sizing.","The construction quality was lower then hoped and the sizing is a little odd. I ended up returning the collar as it would never fit my 50lb boxer quite right. The inner light makes it so you can't fully take advantage of the sizing, so there is a much smaller range of length adjustments."
4,Flashin dog collar,I have purchased and used other Nite Ize products that have held up to their intended use and the Nite Ize Nite Dawg Ligh Up Dog Collar does as well. Living on acreage it was easy to spot our dog when we let her out to go to the bathroom and when I took an evening run I and other vehicles could easily see where she was. Great product and it was less expensive then the reflective vest I was looking at.
4,Bright and fun,"The collar works great -- very bright and visible. Only 4 stars because it is very difficult to turn on and off. You have to press very hard in just the right spot or it won't work. Also, I got a size small for my 15 pound terrier. It would be nice to be able to use it as her regular collar, but it's too heavy and clunky for a small dog, so we only put it on when she's going out at night. That said, it does the job and it's great fun to watch this red light running around the yard at night."
3,light up dog collar,My dog has somewhat thick fur and the light from this dog collar didn't shine out much so it was hard to see it on my dog at night. Would work best with a short haired dog I think.
2,bright but difficult to adjust,The medium size is very large and I could not adjust it to be tight enough for my dog's neck.I have him wear it in addition to the other collar I connect his leash to when we go out at night for walks. I think it will be very helpful as the days are getting shorter. The light is very bright and I don't think cars will have a problem seeing us.
1,Safety Hazard,"The dog collar lighting works great, however, I had a difficult time keeping the collar length adjusted appropriately for my dog's neck. The collar kept slipping, thus creating a longer length. I had to keep adjusting the collar length every few hours. This got so bad that my dog was able to get the collar off her neck and then began chewing the plastic battery compartment to shreds. I'm so thankful she did not eat the battery or other lighting material...this product is not safe and I am extremely dissatisfied with my purchase."
3,Not very adjustable. Decent build quality though.,"Not a terrible quality piece, just a bad design. They do not allow returns for a different size and they wanted to charge me to send it back. What a joke.Pros: Kinda thick, dont have to worry about it ripping.The buckle is pretty strong.Pretty bright lightCons: Due to the design, the large isnt very adjustable. It will not size much larger or smaller. Stuck at 25ish inches.The enclosure for the lights is big.Cannot rate the seller since it is amazon themselves.All in all, I would buy from someone else and save a few bucks. This collar is no different from the $4-10 versions.Update: Amazon offered to pay shipping and refund it, but not swap it. Oh well. I'll update this when I get the cheaper version and compare."
4,Excellent,Works great. button is a little firm to press but otherwise excellent. wish they would give more info on the size. i thought my dog was a large but he was a medium. FYI i got a pure bred black lab. HUGE dog. still a medium
2,Broke rather quickly,The portion that holds the battery broke off rather quickly. The light is rather dim and hard to see. You are better off buying a light that hangs from the collar.
3,Good collar but part of the light is blocked,I've had this collar for about a month and have made use of it on several night hikes and walks. I regularly night hike a trail that is pretty deserted so I'm able to let my dog go off-leash. I thought this would be a great way to see where she was. The way the buckle and on/off switch are designed it blocks about 1/4 of the collar's light. If the leash is angled a certain way then it can make it almost invisible from one side. If I didn't see my dog I would call her name and she'd turn and then I'd see the collar.It's been cold and wet here some lately and we've hiked in both conditions and the collar performed without issue. If your dog's neck size is on the upper end of the limits for the size I'd suggest going up a size as mine seemed a bit tight on the sizing.If buying another lighted collar I would likely look at other models due to the amount of light blocked on this one.
2,Stylish but not durable.,"Works well for the first several days, but when used on a regular basis it gets dirty very quickly preventing it from glowing."
5,look no further for a light for your dog,this is a great light up collar don't buy any other collar i've bought a couple of light up collars but overall this is the best one and extremely well designed extremely strong and reflective and highly visible compare the visibility of that of a Christmas tree this collar can be used as a regular collar also it is excellent for night walks especial in rural arias that don't have lights or side walks for example if you live out in the country like i do its perfect to be seen by cars and for you to see you dog while on a walk or if you leave your pet of the leash its visible up to a 1000 feet which is true i personal tested to see
2,Expensive and not well made,"I purchased this product locally at an REI and the two collars worked for approximately 1 week. One died entirely and they wouldn't replace it and one works but not illumination enough to see at a distance. Both my dogs are solid black and i let them run on an athltetic field near here. No brush or trees, just big open fields. No one can spot the dogs wearing these collars, which contain a tube of Xmas like lights to illuminate. I have the largest size and had to snip off the excess ends, the press button for on or off is difficult to use if you have arthiritis. also it doesn't function on one collar at all, they're not water proof either. I do not recommend this product."
1,barely visable at night,"Its a pretty collar and I like the fiber optic design, but the light diminishes quickly and is barely visable at night. If it was brighter it would be perfect"
1,"Does Not Light Up All Around, Lights Up Only 1 Side Of The Dog",There is a huge portion of this collar that does not get lit up. Because of the design the collar tends to settle in a position where only 1 side of the neck is lit up while the other side is dark. Also had some issues with it turning off and difficulty turning it back on. I ended up returning this and bought the same brand (Nite Ize) Spotlit clip-on light. I'm pretty satisfied with that one.
4,"Better than anything else I've found, yet still leaves room for improvement...","I wasn't expecting a collar as bright as my LED Christmas lights, but I was expecting it to be brighter...that being said, anything is better than searching for those ""dog eye"" reflections in the dark. The collar is probably the best on the market, but I'll keep my eye out for the next generation upgraded model."
5,Very fun with the dog,purchased one of these in red so i could run my dog at night in the field next to our house. it works great and has been a blast. no problems with the collar.
2,Upon arrival it didn't work.,"I came across this item while hiking with my Lab in the evening. A person I passed had both her dogs outfitted with the collar and I was interested enough to ask. I then ordered one. When it arrived it didn't work. I took the time to troubleshoot it and found the battery was dead. Upon replacing the battery the collar works like a champ. My issue, any item you order should come in new and working order. I could see many of these being returned as faulty when all it was, a dead battery."
4,I can see the light!!!!,"Several of us take our dogs to the hunting lease. When it gets dark in the country - it is DARK.I got the orange collar so we could keep track of our dog. Whose trailer is she visiting? Is she out with the cows? Is she still close to camp and far away from the coyotes?This collar is perfect. We can find her in a heartbeat and many of our concerns are eliminated with the reassurance that we can see where she is. In fact, I just looked it up to order another and find the link for the hunting buddies who want one for their dog.The only problem I had was cutting off the excess and threading it back. The buckle is very tight. In fact, I had to use a knife to cut some material away. Considering the fact that we could not find another like it, the adjustment was a small price to pay for peace of mind."
4,great book- easy transaction,My son is a beginner trumpet player and this book with the cd is a great tool for learning.It was recommended by his trumpet teacher. He can play along with the cd.
3,It's not Arban's,"Well It's not Arban's but it's what my daughters band director chose. The DVD/CDs are kind of helpful and keeps the kid's attention, but it doesn't teach circle of fifths or for that mater very many scales either."
1,Iron tablets are a great price BUT,"I ordered these Iron tablets because they were the lowest price. They came two weeks later. If in a hurry do not order from them. I hate the packaging it is hard to open and I have used a razor blade to try to get it open and scissors and it takes so long to get even one pill out. I ended up cutting into a few pills trying to get then out.I will never buy these again, I hate the packaging it is too time consuming to get even one pill out. These are not a good deal because of the packaging.Unless you want to spend 15 minutes getting one tablet out."
4,ANEMIA?,"i bought these iron pills on the advice of my doctor because i am iron deficient and possibly leaking iron out somewhere in my body. other than getting a spinal tap to test for this, i'm trying these pills to see if it helps. should know after i do blood tests in september. as she predicted, i am more constipated than usual and my poop is unusually green! that i can live with........."
4,"The Great TV Turnoff ( Fabulous Five, No 24 )","Katie Shannon is tired of everyone watching so much television, and Mrs. Shannon believes Katie has a point. So she writes an article saying that television is a huge menace to society, which makes Wakeman Junior High decide to have a TV turn off. This means students, teachers, and their families will turn off their sets for two whole weeks! Suddenly, everyone seems to be angry at Katie. Can she show them that just because the television turns off it doesn't mean the fun goes with it?"
5,Finally available again!,"[I almost purchased this bible when I first became a Christian 12 years ago, but it went out of print before I did. I was so excited to see it finally available again after 12 years out of print] . This bible has it all, from great quality print and paper, to excellent doctrinal studies, text explanations, life helps, cross references, summaries and histories of major Christian doctrines.....the list goes on and on. It is a great bible at a very affordable price. A bible not to be missed! Great for new believers and seasoned Christians."
5,This Bible is for the Christian Marathon.,"Where most Study Bibles tell you what is in the text, the Disciples Study Bible tells you what is behind the text. It provides a number of ways to read and apply Christian teachings (27 main doctrines) to your life. I have owned this Bible for several years and have used it to guide my daily walk through the different ways it provides to study and apply Scripture. Not only does it have great notes that help explain Christian teaching on every page, but in the back there are articles on how to become a new believer, what it means, how to live, how to pray, methods of worship, methods of Bible study, memorization, and a host of other topics on the subject of being a disciple of Christ. This is more than a study Bible, it is a Life Manual, if your intent is to live as a Disciple of Jesus."
4,Good study Bible,I like this Bible - good information - straight forward and ease of use for the Study I am in now.
1,a great product gone bad,"I owned one of the earliest versions of this software years ago and it was simple and straightforward to use, and flexible in printing to different sizes for different planners. This version is terrible, and the included help is useless. It is also totally unintuitive where certain functions and features are buried in the software, and Broderbund has not embraced WYSIWYG (the default font of ariel 10 prints so tiny you need a magnifying glass) or customer support (I defy you to figure out how to get any reasonable support from visiting their website). Broderbund seems to be trading on the principal of YGWYPF (you get what you pay for), which in this case, is very little for very little. There is also no reasonable explanation on the website of the functional differences among the various versions they sell. So buyer beware, and be prepared for hours of frustration!!!"
1,A Waste of Money,"This product is difficult to use, especially for printing, and the customer support is non-existent. I haven't found a printer that is compatible with Calendar Creator and organizer pages in the Classic size. I have tried it on three printers with no success. It would be a nice product, if it would just do what it says it does, and perhaps it actually works, if I could only find someone to tell me how to do it. With this type of customer support, I'm going to make an effort to stay away from all of their products."
1,Junk,Calendar Creator 4.0 circa 1996 was and still is brilliant software. When Softkey sold to Broderbund the folks at Broderbund really tried to reinvent the wheel and made it square. Cannot import older 4.0 files and when it does the time doesn't display. The pdf printer doesn't work and when I preview or print the calendar out it is a mishmosh of text. Sorry maybe Softkey can buy back the Calendar Creator Program and fix it.
1,Worthless Junk,"I should have know not to order anything from Broaderbund. I've never been satisfied with any of their products. The software is vague, hard to use and frustrating. I had it off my computer the same day I installed it."
4,Pleased,"I like using customized calendars. As a nursing student, it is vital to be able to manage time down to the minute, because sometimes minutes are all you have. We must complete an ungodly amount of assignments and they must be turned in promptly. Ask any nursing student how important time management is. This product does what I need."
3,SUSPICIOUS,This book lacked depth. When you read it you will see. It's not one of Nora's better stories.
5,A toy that will keep your daughter entertained for hours,My daughter received this for her 3rd birthday 3 weeks ago. She literally has played with this toy everyday since. Highly recommend this toy for any little girl that loves Princesses.
3,"The problem is not Milstein, it's in the transfer to CD","When I put this cd into the player, Milstein was barely audible. So I cranked up the volume, which was ok until the applause started, which was then disproportionately loud. Same deal (to a lesser extent) when I played this on my laptop.The engineers should have transferred the music at a higher volume & adjusted the volume level of the applause. I'd rather not have to adjust the volume so suddenly & drastically while listening."
3,Perhaps I need to hear this a few more times...,"Neither ""Carmina Burana"" nor the ""Schulwerke"" are the only sides of Carl Orff. Furthermore, I agree with the previous reviewer that ""Antigonae"" is, indeed, austere. To my ears, the austerity overwhelms most of the beauty that may be present. Upon listening to this several times during the past year, I've found the work irritatingly monotonous. However, as the title of my review states, I'm willing to try even further to warm up to it."
2,FILTER TOO SMALL,"Filter too small,no way for filter to stand up in humidifier.Metal frame that was on original filter helped,but now that filter is smaller it will not stay in upright position.Beside being a 1/2"" too narrow not having a metal frame makes it pain to use."
4,Appears to be a good repllacement...,"I was a lttle skeptical after reading some of the other reviews saying that this filter media pad was received without a frame or wrong size. However, I received my order a few days ago and although I haven't used it yet, visual inspection shows the metal frame around the pad and it appears to be the same size when placed on top of the existing humidifier pad. The only reason that I didn't give it five stars is that I haven't actually used it yet (Murphy's Law). If no problems when I actually install this new replacement pad, I will order more to have on hand."
5,They came in teh exact measurements that it said it would,We had been looking all over for these humidifier filters. We saw a few that moght have worked on differnt internet sites. But there dimensions were iffy. These were exaclty what they said they would be.
4,Kenmore Humidifier Replacement Filter,"This filter does replace the OEM filter, as described on their website.However, it does not come with the metal frame support like the OEM (Original Equiptment Manufacturer)has.If you want to have the proper fit and support, remove the framework from your old filter, and add it to this one."
5,Totally satisfying time with the mid-career Coltrane...,"I submitted a review of this two months ago pointing out that the track listing is completely wrong for this CD. It has not been published, so I am resubmitting. This album actually contains the following five tunes: Good Bait; I Want to Talk About You; You Say You Care; Theme for Ernie and Russian Lullaby. Fellow players are Red Garland on piano, Paul Chambers on bass and Arthur Taylor on drums. It lasts 40 minutes and was engineered by the legendary Rudy Van Gelder in early 1958. At that time Coltrane was not into the ""free jazz"" and dissonance which marked his 1965-67 releases on the Impulse label. The sounds here are adventurous but melodic and won't scare away the non-avant garde jazz lover at all. This is one of the best of his releases from the late 50's as a leader, and was created just a year before he showed up as a vital part of Miles Davis' ""Kind of Blue"" production. If you like saxophone, buy this. You won't be sorry."
5,I should have found these sooner,"Forget about the the landscape solar lights you stick in the ground on a stake... After taking those out to cut grass or just wear and tear make them in effective plus the lights are dim..... These ones....wow..... I drilled a hole ...sunk them in and turned them on and wow ......greatttttt! They are out of the way, recessed, neat, water proof, stainless steal....and a bright light for one led...... remember this an accent lighting not a flood light smile......They can be sunk in the ground on in a wall, facing up or on its side, works great and the charge last easily 8-10 hours a day..... charges in good light or when cloudy......well worth the price........."
3,"Bright and perfect for outside ""up"" lighting in my patio but...","These are by far the best LED lights I've seen. Very bright, last all night and are a professional quality light. Really do a great job and look fantastic in my patio as up-lighting.But...I purchased six of these light and now three of them are not working after less then a year. I called the company and their customer service was not very good. The first one I had go out I called the company and they had me take the batteries for a day to reset it. Then I had to contact them again after it still didn't come back on and they sent a replacement. Now I have another three that are not working. I'm not looking forward to contacting their customer service again.If I rated the light and quality of the light when they are working, I would give it 5 stars. Because I have had issues with them less then a year later and their customer service is really not great, I can't give it more then 3 stars."
2,I thought I loved them...but...,"When I first installed them, I thought I loved them. After losing several of the $3 lights on a stick from Walmart, the idea of lights buried flush to the ground sounded good. I had trouble with several of on/off switches, which are only accessible by taking the whole light apart. I had 3 units replaced and continue to have problems with the touchy switches. While none have been damaged by being run over, they barely cast any light, especially when the grass grows an inch or two.At $25/each compared to the $3 units from Walmart, I'll stick with the cheapos in the future."
2,Original Audio CD Verison Still Available,"With regard to concerns about the audio quality of the this MP3 version, the original audio CD version (""The Collector's Edition""), an 8-CD set, is still available from Amazon UK. I paid a little more than twice the MP3 price. The ISBN number of the Audio CD version is 0-563-47702-4."
1,Get the 13-disc box set from AmazonUK!,"$117 on the secondary market for this inferior set? HA! Go to AMAZON UK and get the complete 13-disc set in a beautiful box set for about $84 shipped. (I just received mine!)It doesn't take Marvin, with a brain the size of a planet, to see which is better."
4,Tons of useful stuff for real business people,"Not too trendy, not too trite--just right, which is unusual in business books. Yeah, lots of companies have flamed out, and values are way down, and there's this Enron thing. But the Internet is still changing, if not everything, a lot of things. And perspicacious executives will be looking for ideas about how to stay ahead, because it isn't getting any easier or any less competitive. Citrin's book offers a lot of real, practical insight gleaned from an assortment of businesses that, whatever the stock price says this week, seem pretty likely to survive and prosper."
3,More info than needed,"Covered much more than was actually on the test I took. My test only had 4 sections: reading comprehension, math, grammar, and vocabulary. I guess it was worth looking at the guide to get an idea of what kind of questions to expect, but I would check one out from a library before buying it. It was $35 for a thin paperback, spiral bound book."
4,Pretty good,Had similar question style as the HESI test but it's not really necessary to buy this book if you feel confident in your test taking skills.
3,"very brief view of what's on the test, no practice, limited usefulness","This very slim spiral-bound ""book"" (which looks like something you would make at a copy store) is an extremely brief, cursory glance at what to expect on the test. It seems helpful in giving some expectation of what types of information may be on the test (I haven't taken the test yet so I only hope it is accurate in that respect). But it is NOT what I would consider a true review book because it has NO PRACTICE TESTS and very, very few sample questions. About one per section! For the Anatomy and Physiology section in particular I suspect you would be better off studying your course notes or getting a different book.If you want actual practice tests or even sample questions, this is not the book you want. I paid only $25 so I'm not too disappointed, but might be if I had paid some of the high prices people are asking."
1,Not worth the money...,"The book is written for a 3rd grader and provides only the most basic of information. This is especially apparent in the biology, chemistry and physiology/ anatomy sections, where the magnitude of knowledge that can be covered by the actual test is in no way reflected in this manual. There were several free web sites that I felt provided much more information on the individual subjects. All I did was do a search like ""anatomy review"" or ""basic chemistry study guide"" and several sites were available. As for the reading, vocabulary and math sections the guide offers nothing more than the math and English skills most people should have learned in grammar school, so if you had trouble there, please waste your money on this manual. Or you can also do searches on the internet for that material as well."
2,Not what expected,The book I was sent was covered in highlighter all different colors. The book was also overpriced( 20.00 more than B&N and the seller refused my request for a refund due to the book being in poor condition! In fact they never even responded
4,Jump Start Your Heart,This is definitely the coffee to buy if you want to cut back on coffee consumption but need caffeine to wake you up. I find that I can now skip the Americano I used to go pick up halfway though the morning. Pretty tasty too!
3,AAVERAGE,I JUST RATE IT AS AVERAGE CAUSE IT DOES NOT SEEM HIGH IN CAFFEINE TO ME BUT I ALSO DRINK A LOT OF MOUNTAIN DEW
2,Not my favorite,First I didnt feel extra caffeine. Second it doesn't have any good aroma or taste comparing to my favorites: Starbucks or beans from Costco. Wouldn't buy again
4,Hartly and Shelly are great together,"It is a great shame this video isn't available. I saw this movie after seeing Trust, also directed by Hartly and also staring Adrienne Shelly. I was surprised by the range both showed between the two films. If you get a chance to see this film, it's worth the time."
5,Workin' with the Miles Davis Quintet,"This CD was in excellent condition--and, of course, it is a classic. It was a joy to hear."
3,Collecting paychecks,"It begins and ends with certain promise, but throughout the in-between subsides into general bop-predictability 101- a sufficient display for Davis in late 50's prime, but Coltrane-ologists need not apply to this early part-time work."
1,Not Good(warped record),"The one star is not for the music that is great, it's probably for the manufacturer: the record was warped."
3,Workin' works but takes breaks too.,"Great pianistic intro to ""It Never Entered My Mind"" by Red Garland. Hear Coltrane in his ""formative"" years; always reachin' (they should've called it that). Philly Joe Jones is the extreme bebop jazz drummer of the omni-verse. I think this is the first of four in this line-up's recording for Prestige; Relaxin', Steamin' and Cookin' being the other three. Can't go wrong with Workin'."
3,Coltrane is weak.,"Like somebody mentioned below, Coltrane does not sound good. Miles takes minimal number of notes and reduces the songs to their essense generating his unique ""cool"" sound. Coltrane might have had a significant contributions to jazz in general such as well-known Coltrane variations, however he does not suit Miles Davis' cool jazz sound. Coltrane stuffs too many notes with no subtlty. Replacing the saxophone player to other delicate player would make this CD 5 stars."
5,Excellent,"Following the theme set by the previous Prestige titles of the Miles Davis Quintet (Cookin', which cooks and Relaxin', which is ultra mellow), Workin' is a good demonstration of what the group might have played on stage on any given night. Ballads like the lovely version of ""It Never Entered My Mind"" mix well with more uptempo numbers, like classic Miles ""Four"" and ""Half Nelson."" This is an excellent recording of one of the greatest jazz ensembles of all-time and should not be missed."
3,SEALIFE DIGITAL FLASH,"Because this is not a ""dedicated"" flash unit, there was a significant amount of trial and error to achieve consistent operation. I tried several methods to secure the fiber optic slave wire to my Canon underwater housing. Thank God for Duct Tape, just one more handy use! Even with plenty of applied tape it was still hit or miss on synched firing. The product was designed to operate with the Sea Life line and an afterthought to accommodate other housings. When it works, it makes a marked difference in lighting the subject over the flash of the typical land camera. The strobe strength dial was useful, but when scuba diving you're not always afforded multiple opportunities play with exposure and flash strength while shooting a moving target.

4,"Dated, but insightful","This video series provides valuable insight into the counterterrorist operations at one of the most coveted of terrorist targets, New York City. This video shows the diversity of FBI Special Agents, bot demographically and the variatio of job assignments. For anyone interested in becoming an FBI Agent, or if you are curious as to what agents do, then I highly recommend this video."
3,Dated,"This documentary is slow-moving and lacks substance. Nevertheless, it's interesting enough to watch once. The footage is old, with the events discussed from 1996 and prior. It was a bit strange to not hear about 9-11 and to not see people talking on cell phones.Recommended documentaries: Dust to Glory, Animals are Beautiful People"
4,Someone from the FBI wrote it,"Still, it's good if you don't mind the highly biased perspective. I enjoyed the history, the interviews, and the really in-depth camera-work. Taken with a grain of salt, it does an excellent job depicting the types of work the FBI is involved in. Remember, though, this is one History Channel session - don't expect a full-length movie, or an inordinate amount of information about the Bureau."
3,Kinda Long,Interesting to adults. But does not keep the attention of a Senior in High School. Seemed to drag in points in the video.
4,"Interesting concept, but not for the uninitiated listener","This is quite an unusual album for Western listeners - American pop/jazz/soul singer Roberta Flack does an album of covers of a well known Japanese artist. Flack sings the lyrics in English but the songs, both lyrically and musically, sound very ""Japanese pop"". The chord progressions are typically western-influenced Japanese pop and the songs are occasionally unintentionally amusing unless you listen with an awareness that it's translated material. Nevertheless there are some very appealing cuts here - ""Flower"" and ""New York"" are standouts. This album will appeal to Flack completists (recorded in 1999 and never released outside of Japan) but the uninitiated listener may find little of interest."
4,Satisfied with this Product,"I have owned at least three of these headsets, (GE Hands-Free Earset) over the past few years. I am very happy with the sound quality. I have been told that the sound is great when I use this headset. Sometimes I am on the phone for long periods of time and need something like this. The only negative I have is the earloop tends to break off. But since this is the best sounding one I have found, I just replace it as necessary."
1,Great (Not so great),"I'm on the phone all day for work. I've had many headsets. It's great. Highly recommend it.2-20-12. I am updating the review above. This headset worked for a couple weeks and then started buzzing real load. The person on the other end can also hear it. I did suggest this thing to another co-worker who also purchased it, and the same thing happened. Now I look like an idiot."
2,Disappointed,"I had bought this headset before, but it has changed. the flexloop is about worthless as it is so soft, it will not hold in place. Also the sound quality is greatly diminished. Looking for a replacement now but can't seem to find one that was as good as the ones I used to get from Jasco Products."
3,ES BUENO,"EL PRODUCTO ES BUENO, DE BUENA CALIDAD, NECESITARAS UN ADAPTADOR DE 2,5 A 3.5, SI TU APARATO ES DE ESTE ULTIMO TAMANO"
1,Bad Product - broken wire,"I bought three of these. Each one has a short in the wire near the jack. If I hold real still it works, but with any movemet of the phone or wire the connection is gone. It also doesn't work for a PC even if using an adapter and spliter."
2,fun but unfulfilling,"The premise of this novel is great, I loved Veronique and her wacky friends but ultimately the novel goes absolutely nowhere and is a waste of what could have been a fun novel. There are some laugh out loud moments but the story is lacking substance in a lot of areas. I felt kind of cheated when I finished reading it. If you want to read a better example of what this book could have been try out Jen Banbury's Like A Hole In The Head."
2,Brain surgery book review,"As a family getting ready to go through this surgery, this book was little if any help in gaining insight into what to expect. The author was overly emotional and her experiences were just that - her experiences. There was little information on the effects of the surgery - just emotional accounts. For anyone looking for an informational resource, this book is not a good choice."
3,Tommo and Hawk,"This is the second book in a trilogy. I enjoyed the first one ""The Potatoe Factory"" better. Behind the story of Tommo and Hawk, there is historical information about Australia and New-Zealand which is very interesting.My only negative feedback would be the cost. $15 for a digital copy seems a bit steep to me as I can get a hardcover book at my second-hand bookstore for that price and have the pleasure of smelling the pages as I turn them....yes I am old fashioned!!! The only reason I needed a digital copy was to put on my Kindle as we were going on holidays. This book is big and heavy, the kindle is compact and light, great for travelling.I can exchange or sell back my books at second-hand bookstores, but what do I do with my digital copies?????"
5,Tommo&Hawk,Excellent author with wonderful descriptive ability. If you like historical novels you will love this book--both men and women.I am surprised that the Australian trilogy did not become more popular in this country.
5,Impossible to put down,"I have read the trilogy from the 'Potato Factory' to 'Solomon's Song. My only regret, I read 'Solomon's Song' before I read 'Thommo & Hawk'. The novel, like the others,is absolutely captivating & the reader really becomes part of the 'Abacus' come 'Solomon' family. I would have loved to see another sequel or two. Maybe Bryce has something in mind to continue the Solomon saga. The trilogy was the best I have ever read. Congratulations, Bryce."
3,"i love bryce courtenay, but....","I read ""The Potato Factory"" and loved it. When ""Tommo and Hawk"" came out I was very excited. But after finally finishing the novel, I found I was a little disappointed. As Bryce Courteny tends to do, he packs all of his wonderful ideas for a story into one book, which calls for too much story. So many amazing and incredible things happened in this book, that by the end you are just overwhelmed with all the activity. In all, it was all right, and because Courtenay has written so many other good books that I will still buy his books as soon as I see them. But this one isn't as amazing as the other ones I've read. And , like usual, the story ends setup to have a sequel."
4,Great read,"It was a very good read about the early history of the colonies of Tasmania, New South Wales and New Zealand and gave me an insight to the native populations at that time and the effects that the Colonials and Convicts had on those peoples.I enjoyed Bryce Courtenay's writing style with the story moving at a fast pace and it is second book in a trilogy so it needs to be read as a whole to understand fully the main characters.I would recommend this to most age groups with a warning that they need to be accepting of the language and customs of that era which some may find a bit lurid."
2,ropes,"All I can say is you get what you pay for. I will order another, if you drop the rope in the rain or snow be prepared to have to dry it."
1,Don't buy this if the pump is your reason for purchase.,"Bought this item last July [...]. Just as the other reviewers have stated, the dehumidifier pump worked for 6 months then died. Too bad because the dehumidifier function was quiet and efficient but I needed the pump since it would be in a relatively inaccessible place.Getting the pump to work requires following specific steps...unplug the unit for 3-5 minutes, plug it back in, press the ""pump"" button, press the on-off button (these were the instructions given me by the technical service folks at Delonghi). Had to do this several times since every time the power fails (even for a split second) the unit shuts off.[...]."
1,"Dehumidifies well, pump is a bust","I needed the pump feature on this unit as I don't have a drain anywhere near by to gravity feed. I've now owned this for a little over a year. The first 6 months were great, unfortunately, as others have stated, the pump died. The reservoir that can be used instead of the pump is quite small compared to my other dehumidifier. The unit still dehumidifies, but no longer serves its original purpose, which was to automatically empty the water. There are better units out there that are cheaper and have larger reservoirs. I can not recommend this product."
2,Pump Broke,"I bought one of these Delonghi dehumidifiers a couple years ago because of the pump feature. After a couple of weeks, the pump simply stopped working. It was also quite noisy, but then, so most dehumidifiers. I also didn't like that the blower ran all the time, even after the desired humidity was reached (though too, I know that many models do this)."
2,Pump stopped after four months,"I purchased this dehumidifier from Costco for about $200. It worked well except after heavy rains when it just couldn't keep up with the excess humidity. However, after about four months the pump stopped working. Heavy duty pump my . . . ahem. Anyway, thanks to Costco's return policy I got my money back but I would stay away from this product if you have any intention of using the pump feature."
1,My Pump also quit,"As I have read in many posts, my pump also won't pump. It fills up the small res on a daily basis so you have to empty every day and when it is full, usually about 3 am it makes a never ending beeping sound you can hear all over the house so If I forget to empty it before bed I will be emptying it at 3am like it or not. Also the humidity control gauge is nowhere near accurate. My own gauges tell me about 50% and it reads 90%. I don't like this unit at all."
1,Good at first,"The DeLonghi DE400P Energy Star 40 Pint Dehumidifier with pump worked great when I first bought it. It had everything I wanted, 16 ft hose, pump, and removed at least a gallon of water a day. When the warranty ran out, the pump stopped working. I set it up so it could drain into a sink. It worked fine this way for a couple of months. Then it rusted up. The inside are all rust orange and black goo.This unit is definitely over rated."
3,MIXED EMOTIONS,I HAD TROUBLE GETTING THE PUMP TO WORK AS ADVERTISED. IT WILL PUMP TO A FLOOR DRAIN BUT NOT TO A 4' HIGH DRAIN PIPE I SET UP FOR MY WASHER. I WAS A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED IN THE OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS. I FELT THEY COULD BE A LOT CLEARER. IT RUNS FAIRLY QUIET. A LITTLE TRICKEY IN CHANGING THE FILTER. TECH SUPPORT WAS POLITE AND INFORMATIVE.
2,Auto- shutoff,"The auto shutoff doesnt really shutoff. The de-humidifier portion stops running, but the fan continues. I asked Delonghi support and they said that you should not run the fan more than 48hr. I opted with an LG instead, which actually shuts off when thr humidity level is reached."
1,Unequivocal: Pure Junk,I wish I could give this machine 0 stars. Pump failed after 3 months of use. Delonghi wanted me to drive 60 miles to get it repaired under warrenty. Will never buy a DeLonghi product ever again.
2,Pump sucks,"I have had 2 DE400P dehumidifiers - one lasted almost 2 years and one lasted almost 3 years. Pump malfunctioned in both cases. I expected better service from these units. Also, DeLonghi service centers are few and far between, so can not realistically expect factory-approved service. I will not buy another DeLonghi due to poor quality and lack of convenient service centers."
2,"JUST OUT OF WARRANTY, IT DIED.",Worked until warranty ran out. I shipped to a authorized dealer. They said freon had leaked out and it wasn't repairably. The 5yr compressor warranty didn't cover the problem.
2,Compressor failure,"The compressor has now failed and the dehumidifer is not worth repairing, 1 year and 11 months after purchase. This is the second delonghi machine that has failed. I believe the unit is cheaply manufactured."
1,Died after 2nd year - Bucket doesnt fill and water spills on floor,I thought this was a wonderful for the 2 years that it worked. I paid top dollar for this Delonghi as they were in high demand when I purchased it and were no where to be found. It has stopped filling the tank and does collect water and dumps it on the floor. I will try a hose to see if I can get it to dump it in a bucket but its ridiculous for all this $$. Not my top pick for sure.
2,BAD PUMP???,"I have not received mine yet, but by all the bad reviews I regret it already. Just wanted to point out that if you bought this and the pump doesnt work or well as it should. Go to a plumbing supply and get a Little Giant condensate pump 110 volts, about the size of a shoe box, then run the discharge hose. They are reliable cost about $30, after reading all the bad pump issues I wish I would have bought the cheaper NO PUMP."
1,Don't count on the pump,"Bought this unit 2 years ago. Pump died after 2 months. Brought it to a certified repair center. It took the company 8 months to figure out that they can't send the repair center a pump, so about 3 months ago, they finally sent me a brand new unit, and yesterday, the pump died again on the new unit. Stay away from this dehumidifier. The pump stinks. Oh, and this new unit leaks as much water as it sucks from the air. Stay away. The pump was a good idea but, if it doesn't work, then whats the point? STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT"
1,The quality is ver low,"First, the product's quality is very low, the unit I purchase just last for 18 month, and before you make a puchase, please make sure your local area has a repire center. I lived in Atlanta, Georgia. Unfortunately, the closed one is in florida or Ohio."
2,Pricey - didn't last long,"Bought this dehumidifier at Cosco mainly for the pump, hate to empty buckets, worked great for a year then cooling cycle stopped - warranty sites not many or to far away We live in the north east - New Jersey millions of people - repair shops should be close - our throw away society - nothing built to last - disappointed"
4,"Works very well, but instructions are confusing.","Using this dehumidifer with pump is great! However, it took a little time to figure out the correct way to attach correct hose to pump. Blue cap is covering the connection for the long hose to pump water out of room. The instructions dont tell you that. They say to drill hole in bucket for allowing water to go down drain. If you want to use pump, do not drill!In the month that has gone by it is working great!"
2,This unit worked great for about a month,Bought this unit just over a month ago and loved the pump because I need it for the basement. Went down to the basement the other day to find out the unit was leaking all over the floor and caused a flood. Thank god I bought it from Costco because it was over a month and most stores wouldn't have taken it back. Stay away from this product. The pump is a great idea but the quality is terrible.
1,Worked great for 3 months. Pump died,"After trying to find online instructions to see what I'm doing wrong with this dehumidifier, it appears the pump is broken (after reading these reviews). I bought mine from costco and will return it tonight. This might work great if you don't ever need to turn it on! Should have known by where it was made."
2,OK?,"From day one, the pump has not pumped a drop (i.e. not working). It seems to work well taking moisture out of the air, but small capacity container needs changed every couple of hours. Keep looking if you don't like frustration...there are probably some systems that pump, but some may be a gamble."
1,The D*** Pump Failed,"Pump failed after about 1 year. Otherwise it's OK. But I bought it for the pump feature, so one * only as a rating. I have owned several DeLonghi products and they all do what the dehumidifier pump is supposed to do: SUCK. Consumer Reports is right on the mark with its dismal ratings for DeLonghi products."
5,Comfortable,"The most comfortable earplugs I have ever used. They keep out the noise, and you hardly know they are there."
5,Very Good Ear Plugs,These are very comfortable all day ear plugs. I use them while riding my motorcycle and sometimes in noisy motels. These ear plugs are supposed to be disposable but can be used multiple times with the same good results.
4,A good reference book for acute illness,"This is a good reference book. When my child is ill I look in this book as well as several others to try to get a picture of an appropriate remedy. Because homeopathy is somewhat complex I think it is better to consult several reference books to gain a good picture of the illness. This book is catagorized by illness ie. common cold, cough,fever etc., which makes it easy to pinpoint the section I am interested in to get an idea of appropriate remedies. It also has a section in back with a more complete picture of many of the remedies mentioned."
4,Nice,This is a good book to have. I got this book a fortnight back only. I am referring it to treat my 6 months old daughter.
2,Homeopathic medicine is not for the layperson,You really need to study homeopathic medicine to get the full benefit of it. This book is too simplistic and general to be useful.
1,Don't put kids at risk,"It's the 21st Century, and people still believe the magic potions of homeopathy can help them.It's especially worrying that this book specifically targets vulnerable children with it's promises of magic cures.The simple facts are: there is nothing in homeopathy. It's water or sugar pills. [....]This book, by encouraging parents to try to cure sick children with sugar and water, rather than actual medicine, may place innocent lives at risk.Please, if you have a sick child, take them to a real doctor!"
4,Consistent quality,I have a few fitted hats by Twins and they have all been of decent quality and design.
2,AWFUL PRODUCT NOT DURABLE AT ALL,"I bought this toy for my guinea pigs expecting it to last at least a week and didn't even last 1 day! I was completely surprised when the next day I saw the toy in pieces, don't buy it, at least for guinea pigs!"
2,comes apart too easily,I have to bunnies who love to play with their toys. I was so excited when I ordered this for our little girl who also loves to chew. Our boy already has something similiar. I immediately gave this to her and with in an hour the entire thing was apart and the walnut out. I expected this to be a chew toy but instead she was able to just pull out the thinner pieces 1 by 1 and now its just a bunch of pieces of wood. I would recomend this type of toy for the bunnies but not this brand...
3,Not A Favorite Toy of My Mini Lops,"I was surprised that my Mini Lop didn't like this toy (and a little bummed since it was an expensive little ball!) He likes to nudge things and since this is round, when he nudges it it doesn't roll away so he can run after it. He is intrigued by the large walnut thing in the middle that makes a sound when you shake it, but since he can't roll it, he can't make it make the sounds. I've seen him try playing with it a couple of times but overall I don't think this was a good buy for him."
5,My three bunnies love it,My three rabbits just loved this when it came in the mail. I am trying to discourage furniture chewing so hopefully this will help. It was so popular with them I immediately ordered another!
5,Best chew toy ever,I got this for my four gerbils and all of them love it. They destroy is and get to the walnut in the middle in about a month. I just had to crack the nut with a pocket knife because they couldn't do it on their own. I think I got the normal or mini size last time so I upgraded to the big size so it will last them longer.
5,Does the job,"My buddy gave me an old mp5 spring airsoft gun and it was lacking a clip. After some thought, I decided that this one had the best chance of fitting, so I ordered and got it in about 3 days from airsplat i believe. The magazine worked great after a few modifications. Theres a button on the top of the clip that releases the BBs 1 at a time. I removed the button and taped the internal plastic peice back so that no BBs would get stuck inside the clip. As of right now everything seems to be working great and i recommend this to anyone who believes this clip might fit your gun or if it is for your gun"
4,hemp jewelry book,more for beginer and children not the more older person that knows a little about the craft of hemping it is easy
2,Nothing memorable,"The premise was interesting and has potential. But the writing was off. I felt the author was trying to write 'down', using vernacular and slang which didn't sit well with the rest of the writing. The heroine's daughter didn't act or talk like a nine-year-old. The heroine's interaction with her daughter came off as stilted and unnatural. The heroine's father couldn't decide whether he liked the hero or not, nor his reasons for that indecision. The femme fatale was wholly unnecessary. I liked that so much of the story was from the hero's pov. And the hero was likeable enough. But, overall, too many problems to give it more stars."
3,Somewhat ok,"The documentary comes off as being a bit one-sided as it shows all the negative aspects of the lottery. I'm not sure what I expected from this video, but from the point of view of someone who is simply curious to learn more on the topic, this did seem to promote the idea that state-sponsored lotteries are immoral.If I were doing research on the topic of lotteries, I might give this four stars. However, from the point of view of a curious viewer, I give it 2.5 stars."
5,"A true all-time classic! A ""must-have"".","If your only impression of Edward G. Robinson's acting skills is: ""N'yeah, you mugs..."", then this film should serve to showcase for you his masterful talents. There is not one wasted or superfluous scene; it has everything that denotes greatness in every aspect of filmmaking(in my opinion, of course). It's a thinking person's action adventure that will haunt your heart."
2,Not really the book,"I am reviewing an AVI conversion of the PAL DVD since it is not available except in Spain. I just read the book and I admit this screenplay really bothered me. If you forget about Jack London's masterpiece this is a 5 star forgotten movie and perhaps E.G. Robinson's greatest role. This is supposed to be about a kidnapped man of leisure philosopher who becomes a man due to his ordeal with Captain Wolf Larsen an obvious psychopath. It is also about a kidnapped famous dainty female writer who forms a relationship with the hero in the book. Instead she is written as an escaped convict, who conspires with another convict and go off into the sunset together, as the real hero is killed by Wolf as they are both swallowed by the sea. the screenwriters were on drugs or never read the book."
1,Caveat emptor,"Buyers, please be aware: this is not the Edward G Robinson, Ida Lupino film from 1941. This is, despite many deceptive indications not least of which is the vagueness of the distributors description, the 1993 version with Christopher Reeves. This version is not a very good movie, it screams of poorly funded made for TV all over it. In addition, the quality of the dvd-r is terrible. I have VHS movies recorded from TV that are far better in quality than this piece of plastic. Please do not purchase this poorly made, poorly distributed movie. Use your money to buy a much better movie to watch while we all wait for a release on dvd of the original 1941 film. I would recommend any film available with Edward G Robinson, or Ida Lupino, as an alternative."
1,Not what I thought I was buying!,I thought I was purchasing the Edward G. Robinson movie. It was not. This starred Charles Bronson and Christopher Reeve. Also the picture quality was horrible. I threw it away!
2,A little bit disappointed.,"Pros: I like the color, pattern and design of this crib set.Cons: You cannot find ""Anna Clair"" anywhere on the package, The package insert says it is imported by ""ZZ baby"", and made in China.The detail quality of the set is poor. I could do a much better job with a sewing machine. The crib skirt looks less than 150 thread count.For $29.99, you got what you paid for. Definitely do not buy it as a gift."
5,This drive is plug n play and excellent value for the money,"I bought this drive at Staples $130 less $30 instant discount and $30 MIR thus costing $70! It didnt come with a card but my new Dell 4700 can handle drives larger than 137GB capacity. I put this drive into an external USB 2.0/Firewire case I bought from CUSA for $40.After connecting the USB cable and flipiing the power switch to on, it was recognized instantly by my Win XP Media Center DELL 4700 PC. I used software it came with to set up the drive and it was ready in less than 5 minutes. Total formatted capacity 203GB!! So I have a 200GB external drive for barely $110 less 12% Staples customer appreciation discount this week."
1,"Only thing lasted shorter than the drive, was the warrenty","Drive was slow to open, and got the ""click of death"" after 13 months. Maxtor only warrenties for 6 months. Seems they know something you should know!"
1,Where is the zero star option,"If you like to fry eggs on your hard drive, use Maxtor. If you don't like the heat, get out of the 'Maxtor' kitchen and get yourself a real hard disk like Seagate or WD. I work in the IT field and cannot count the number of dead Maxtors I've seen over the years. I doubt very much that Maxtor uses TQM, Six Sigma, or the Toyota way to produce their inexpensive HDD's."
1,Beware the Maxtor MaxBlast 3.0 software,"WARNING: Maxtors warranty claims that they are not responsible for any data loss experienced by using their software to upgrade to the new drive.TRANSLATION: After having my original (functioning, working) Win2K SP4 system corrupted by the MaxBlast 3.0 software (following all instructions), Maxtor has refused to respond to my complaints in a satisfactory way. The total cost was >20 hours of my time completely reinstalling my system and programs.SUGGESTION: Don't use the software provided. Research other hard drive vendors who make similar products but have better warranties."
1,Stay away from Maxtor Drives (0 Stars),"I would not even give it one star but that is the lowest score possible. This is the second Maxtor drive that failed after just over a year (you think that I would have learned by now.) After crashing a couple of times already, the drive seems to be heading to the death zone after the latest crash. Of course, as another reviewer noted, the waranty is shorter than the short life of this drive.This may appear to be a bargain but it does not last so it is very expensive in the long run.I would not use a Maxtor drive even if it was given to me free bacause it is not worth the time I spend on recovery every time it crashes not to mention the unrecoverable data between backups.Never again Maxtor."
1,worst quality I have ever seen.,"In the last few months I bought 4 maxtor harddrives from different places, and i must say that i agree with Mr. Robert Bornstein, at first I didn't have any problems with them but 3 months later I started havening alot of problems with 2 hard drives... don't buy maxtor.."
5,Great price for a very able 200gig drive,"This drive was too good of a price to pass up when I needed more room for pictures and videos; I was actualy a bit leery about this purchase, given the size of the drive at this price, but I have been very satisfied. The drive installs easily enough for those not afraid of taking the cover off the computer, and should work with most computers."
1,Just plain horrible ..,"First thought - no one should be able to write a review on a hard drive until it's a year old. If that were the rule, you would see almost no positive reviews for these new maxtor drives. Purchased 5 drives over a one year period and have had three fail. Maxtor replaced those without any issue, except that the replacement drives (which were refurbished) also failed within 3 months. Quite and fast mean nothing if you end up losing your data. BTW - each drive had dedicated cooler fan and pc's were on UPS so there aren't any excuses. There's a reason why these drives have one year warranties. Beware."
3,roping60 review,"This was a documentary on mostly the energy boom in Wyoming and the checks a nd balances between the state of Wyoming and the oil and gas companies extracting the resourses. It was alright , butI probably would not have purshased it if I had read how short it was. It hit on some key points , but did not go indebt enough."
2,Complications for the sake of complications,"This software was so complicated and so hard to use that I gave up on it. Making a simple monthly calendar was well-near impossible. The compexity of the bells,horns and whistles was beyond me, and I have thirty years of experience with data base and spreadsheet software."
1,"Lousy software, Waste of Money.","I've used various versions of Calendar Creator for over 10 years, and this has to be the absolute worst incarnation of what WAS a nice little program. The only reason I bought it was that version 4 will not run on WinXP. Forget getting a simple calendar! You can't. In previous versions you could add MULTIPLE event lists (US Holidays, Religious Holidays, etc.); with CC12 you can only add ONE. The basic calendar is portrait orientation only with an event list prominently over the caledar itself. You can change the orientation, delete the list, but NOT move the title to the center. I'm sorry there isn't a ""No Star"" option, because it doesn't even rate one star!!!Don't buy this piece of junk and be disappointed and frustrated. I've deleted it, and won't buy another borderbund product. They forgot simplicity in the face of so many bells and whisltes that the user(at least this user) was totally confounded."
1,not good....,"when i received this product, the bottle is not as white as it is shown in the picture, and the color is yellow...i mean,the color that only those old plastic bottles have. What's worse, there are some really small plastic objects within the cream!!! I only used it for my body skin, and....the whole bottle of cream contained those small plastic stuff....so gross!!! don't buy it!!!"
5,Ole Timer Jersey,Love the shirt! This was a birthday present for my son. We are so impressed with the quality that we will definitely use this Amazon site again.
4,"Amusing, different","I am avowed Josephine Baker fan. These 3 films (and included vintage footage from contemporary Paris nightclubs, including some Baker) are the 'Holy Grail.' Seperately acquire ""The Josephine Baker Story"" (Lynn Whitfield)and you have found heaven on earth."
2,Great at first,"My son loved the toy and couldn't wait to get it opened, but the problem came when we tried to close it back up. The treasuer box would not close back up easily. I had to work at it very hard, my son who is 7 could not close it by himself. He got pretty frustrated."
2,not comprehensive,"I was hoping for a more complete listing of state parks with detailed information, but this is more of a photo spread of a pretty tiny sample of state parks. If you like sitting in an armchair and looking at pretty pictures, this is a good book. If you want information about state parks in order to plan trips, go elsewhere."
2,A Little Disappointed,"The book read like an advertisement, and did not include all of the State Parks. I returned it. There were a lot of pretty pictures, though."
5,very pleased with item,This knife was purchased to replaced one that had been lost. The price was good and the quality had improved. I was very pleased with the purchase and fast shipping.
2,"Great presentation, weak content","This book is full of exceptinal work! Unfortunately, it is not as technical as I thought it would be. In my opinion, it was written more as a showcase of the work it presented. It did very little in the way of explaining such fundamentals as how to select the wood for your project, or guide the reader in honing their own design and technique. If you are interested in learning the art of box making this is not the book for you. I would suggest Box-Making Basics: Design, Technique, Projects by David M. Freedman, which I purchased along with this book."
5,awesome movie,I watch videos on youtube videos and clips from up syndrome and thought those videos was very impressive. I actually now Jesse Moreno from where he goes during the day and i acctually know him
4,New York City vs Frank Cavanagh a lone orphan boy,"This story takes place in New York City at the turn of the century. I just read an old 1914 edition. ""Our Hero"", orphaned Frank Cavanagh, has more or less been booted out by his mean and tightwad Aunt and Uncle of Hartford CT. He takes the boat to New York (Connecticut River flows into Long Island Sound almost like I91 today). After being swindled out of his 25 cents he has to start his new life, he embarks on a journey that takes the reader to all classes of 1900 New York City life. The tale is uplifting and inspires one to live a life of Loyality to friends in any circumstance, Integrity, Honesty, and Valor, which will bring one great reward. The story reads fast, is well written, and really does leave one uplifted and wanting to be a Hero too."
4,Gund: My First Tackle Box,"This is a good toy for a small child. No pieces to get caught in throat, soft and easy to keep clean. Bright colors. It is a little small but it is for little people."
1,Tiniest toy I have seen!,"This item is not what I had expected, and I did not listen to the reviews - consequently. This item may be to small for a baby, it is not worth the money at all!"
1,Disappointment,"I ordered this toy for my 6 month old grandson. Our family is big on fishing. It was much smaller than I thought it was. You really can't do anything with the pieces except chew on them and at almost $20, I returned it. I was disappointed in the product."
5,VHS movie review,"Although an older movie, I thoroughly enjoyed it. The two little girls were very believable but the older brother needed more training"
5,good product..made my life easier,I wish I had known about this product a long time ago. It has made watering my flowerbeds so easy. I have flower garden in the front and vegetable garden in the back .quick connect have made it easier for my 5 year daughter to take the hose out and play and then put it back..
3,does the trick and interchangeable...,hooks up nicely with my other quick disconnect adapters. provides a universal hookup for male to male and even my kitchen faucet to garden hose clamp adapter. i use these once a week when i water my planted potter herbs on my deck
4,Good Substitute for Ball Valve,"This set is a good substitute for quick disconnect ball valves, which are no longer available from Melnor (I bought the other brand of quick disconnect ball valve (sold on Amazon) at Home D., and threw it away when it would not seal at the threads). The only drawback is that the internal check valve in the ""Stop"" end connection is susceptible to slight leakage when side torques are applied to whatever is connected to it. The Melnor quality is consistent with my past Melnor quick disconnects, and superior to others currently sold."
4,great for the $$$,Leaks just slightly if you dont get it screwed on just right. But you can't beat the price. I reccomend it for anyone.
5,Timeless work reads like a novel,"This book lived up to the reviews I read on Amazon prior to reading it. As promised, it provides an exhaustive overview of the entire sweep of the Roman empire (minus the early years of the Republic) and, unbelievably, it reads like a novel. What a treasure trove of knowledge and insight."
3,"Too Much Computer... but first, the title is incorrect!","It should read, Every Best Single + 3! My first impression of this cd was It would work on Dance, Dance, Revolution. There's too much computer thumping going on here. It also rocks with eighties rock riffs but there's no denying it's So Disco! But the performances are great, There just seems to be no ambient moments to set each instrument apart except for the rock riffs.It's still worth a listen but forget about ballads, this stuff makes a club jump. Three stars tops unless you want to call it rightfully J-Disco. then 3 and 1/2 stars."
4,More fun than a barrel full of Maseratis,"Amazing, almost photo-realistic tour of Maui. Works SO much better with a steering wheel than a gamepad (I got a Logitech Momo force-feedback wheel.) I haven't even scratched the surface yet. Online multiplayer holds much promise. Lots of fun!"
3,Test Drive Unlimited,"The cops will drive you crazy in this one. I'm not one to rate racing games because I'm not really that good. I wish they had an easy, novice, beginner mode. I think the driving physics in this game is pretty good and I like the graphics. It's just that I'm no good and can't beat the game."
1,Test Drive Unlimited constantly hangs,The game when I am able to play it is fun and I like it a lot but it always hangs and aborts when it does an auto-save. You have to go back into the game and then sometimes it doesn't save where you were. It is very annoying and makes the games unplayable.
3,"Ehh, could be better.","I played the original Test Drive many year ago. This newest addition doesn't really inspire you to finish the game. I much prefer the Need for Speed series over this game. If you want fun and excitement with a lot of harsh police chases, then get a Need for Speed game. If you are looking for more of a Microsoft Simulator game that has nice cars, then you may like this one. It's not full of excitement, but the scenery is nice..."
4,Fun arcade style racing...,"Not a sim - which to me is a good thing - it looks very nice, plays fun, has enough depth to be interesting but not tedious. The cars look and sound great - overall a really good arcade style racing game."
2,"HD video DVD, rather a PC game","The graphics are HD quality, with Hawaii roads, you will definitely you will enjoy to watch the game.With my Logitech Momo wheels, I could play all other race/road games without problem. Other games has superior ability to detect the wheel control compared Test drive. May be this game is good for other devices like Xbox/PS etc, but definitely do not have better control with logitech device.Second thing is mouse control during the game play is not stable.The patches they release will proof of the inability of this game.Recomended for who wants to watch the HD DVD of Hawaii rather than play this game.Also visit their forum, before purchase of this game."
1,do not buy,We purchased this game and loaded it on the computer. Despite having plenty of memory and all the other requirements it never worked and then we discovered that it was infected with viruses and malware. Do not buy!
3,not as bad as it could've been,"This book was longer than I expected it to be. The illustrations were very well done, and the history was explained well at a 5-6 year old's level. It did, however, seem to be a little non-sequitur and was definitely written from a skewed view-point."
3,Just what you'd expect,"This CD is a must-purchase if you're looking for the sweeping musical excerpts and light, jovial melodies from the movie. However, the inclusion of the Kenny Loggins song that has very little to do with the movie is a cheesy marketing ploy. It's not a bad song, but it's not a song one must hear. I recommend this purchase if you want to add these cues to your soundtrack collection, but not otherwise."
5,Burner Covers,The Corelle Coordinates Blue Hearts Economy Rectangular Burner Covers Set of 2 were exactly what I had been looking for and were offered at a very reasonable pricel
1,Birdman of Alcatraz & Elmer Gantry (1943) does not make sence,"Birdman of Alcatraz & Elmer Gantry (1943) does not make sence when both movies came out in the ""60s"". I ordered this item and was sent an old Sherlock Holmes VHS."
1,Magellan Support Stinks,Lost my Color Merridian overboard and had to replace the GPS. When I recieved the new GPS I called Magellan to get a new unlock code so I could load the charts on my replacement GPS. I was informed I would have to purchase a new bluenav CD since they only issue one unlock code with no exceptions. Well my exception is I will never buy another Magellan product Hardware / Software. As for the replacement Color Merridian it is being returned today. In the future I will purchase Garmin.
1,"Just a portable map, get a Garmin V instead","Slick package and nice color display. Some clever features for boating but doesn't do the one, most important, thing I need; auto-routing. The straight line GOTO function is worse than useless, just a weak imitation of a routing function and more likely to get you to a dead end than where you want to go. I use a GPS unit on a motorcycle to get driving instructions and this is just a portable map. I recommend a Garmin V or StreetPilot instead, they have real auto-routing functions."
1,Beware of this product,"Magellan calls this model a ""legacy product"" and they refuse to support it.Meridian Color is actually about 8 years old, but Magellan has no shame.You will not even be able to register your ""new"" unit.If nothing else, dealing with Magellan is very frustrating; they always push you to participatein their ""gear exchange"" program - but do nothing more.You'll be better off buying Garmin or Delorme handheld GPS."
2,color display too dark,I bought one of these because it had a color display. After I received it I noticed the display was practically impossible to see unless the backlight was on high. I drove around with it a little and it tracked where I went very well but I had to leave the light on all the time and it ran the batteries down in about four hours. I was using Duracell 1800 nimh rechargables.I returned it the next day and got a Meridian platinum for less money and it has a barometer and thermometer. The display is visible in the day and you only need the back light on at night.Unless you like changing batteries often get a Meridian platinum or a Meridian gold.
1,Magellan Promised Updates but Didn't Deliver!,"We purchased this item two years ago when the item was truly hot on the market. At that time, the Magellan website indicated that regular mapping updates would be available for all the Meridian products. On the contrary, NOT ONE update has been produced, and now we see where the Meridian product line is being discontinued. We would not have purchased a Magellen had we known that mapping updates were not going to be produced as promised. Regularly during the course of two years, we emailed the manufacturer of the Magellan products to inquire about the updates. Our replies continually indicated that the mapping updates were 'on the way.' They never were produced! Basically, our investment is now obsolete with no hopes of mapping updates, Magellan obviously cannot be trusted, and we won't purchase another Magellan product again. With so many companies, including Dell, entering the GPS market, there's no need to invest in Magellan again."
3,Product is good software needs work,The Base unit is good...backlight draws a LOT of battery time (expect 1-2 hours with the backlight on). Don't expect an easy interface with their software. Support is also lacking. I use for both boating and driving (BlueNav/Topo). Both pieces of software need integration work (the maps will not co-exist on an SD card (I have 128 Meg SD card) More than 32 Meg is a waste of money. Hopefully they will upgrade the software and firmware.
1,Short lived,"This product worked pretty well, for one season. It was fairly quiet and the pump system worked. But here we are for season two and all it's doing is blowing air around and not taking a drop of humidity out of the air. What junk. I bought it from Home Depot but I just looked at their site and it doesn't seem as though they carry them anymore - for good reason. I bought this unit because I have a DeLonghi space heater that's 15 years old and works great, so I thought they made things well. Boy, was I wrong."
1,Don't buy any DeLonghi Products,"They don't last and the service is rediculous. A very small plastic part snapped that is needed to control water tank overflow -- obviously poor design to start with. Replacing it would require no disassembly or unscrewing anything -- just lifting it out and slipping in a replacement. The company refused to let me buy a replacment part. I was told that it had to be packed and shipped to a repair center. An absolutely ludicrous and pathetic excuse for customer service and an obvious customer-gouging policy. Don't buy DeLonghi anything -- I doubt any DeLonghi products are worth the trouble, expense or hassle."
2,"Pulls water out of the air, but pump stopped working","The reason I bought this dehumidifier is because of the pump. Everything worked great for 15 months, but then the pump stopped working. After discussing the issue with the support center, I was told the nearest service center is 90 miles away. I would have to ship it and pay for the repair if I want it fixed. That would be more than just buying a new one. They need to get more Service centers to support their product. It pulls water from the air, but now I have to empty the bucket 3 times a day!"
4,Great but a little loud,We have two of these units in our basement. They have worked well at maintaining an acceptable humidity level but with the pump action engaged they are audible upstairs in the family room. It is a low drone but perhaps in future models it could be eliminated.
1,Replace After Two Years,"The appliance worked well most of the first dehumidifying season--May-September, but in September, gradually became less effective removing humidity. Now in its second season, the humidifier cannot keep the humidity level less than 65%---at any lower setting, the compressor runs, but does not pull water. Do not bother contacting DeLonghi or accessing their website; DeLonghi continues to sell a product long after they have removed information about it from the website. Try another product."
2,Avoid Delonghi Dehumidifier,I've owned this product for about 2 years. It has stopped working. The pump stopped working after about 6 months. It rattled a few weeks after purchase. It did a great job dehumidifying our basement for as long as it lasted. I wouldn't recommend.
2,"nice feature set, but a few problems","I have had this unit for 2 days now. The two problems I have are 1) unbearable rattle - which I fixed by stuffing a small piece of cardboard between the filter and side panel, and 2) the current humidity level is not accurate. If I just plug the unit in, but not turn it on, the current humidity level that is displayed is accurate. But once I turn it on, the current humidity level that it displays goes down to about 30% lower than the actual relative humidity. This means that to keep my room at 55% I need to set the unit to 35% (which is the lowest it goes). I bought this because of the electronic controls, but if they are inaccurate, I might as well return it for a cheaper, non-electric model."
1,Pump stopped working just after warranty.,"This unit worked great the first summer I owned it. Humid summers in New England, stinky basements. This summer, I plugged it in and set it up again and it worked for about a week. Then the pump stopped working. The small bucket fills up so fast you only get a couple of hours out of it. So I punched a hole in the bucket for the drain hose, but it's only 3 feet long so I had to relocate the unit to a corner of my basement by the sump pump hole and it doesn't do such a good job now. I bought the unit for the pump, and now - like many others here - it's broken. Based on this, and the review of others here it's basically useless unless you can empty it like 12 times a day..."
1,"Junk, don't buy it!","Worked beautifully for about 6 months, then drain pump went out, 2 weeks later the whole unit got really noisy and stopped working. Called Delongi, they were not helpful at all, told me I had to ship the unit to Ohio and gave me a phone number where no one would answer or return my call.."
1,"I own it, you shouldn't","I purchased this product as a spare. I left it in my garage in the box and when I needed it because my other unit failed, it had been a few weeks over a year since its purchase. I plugged it in and the fan worked the display functioned, everything appeared fine. The unit never produced an ounce of water. I called the warranty people at the company, and they were unresponsive and curt. Said if I mailed the unit at my expense 800 miles to some service center that they might cover the parts depending on which parts had failed. Do youself a favor and look at another brand of dehumidifier."
5,Saved my comfort!,"I bought this to put it in my basement. My basement is extremely humid, due to the fact that; A) it's a basement, and B)I live on the East Coast. This is also where my home theater is, and there's nothing worse than watching a movie and sweating like a dog. I put this unit down there and it helps the situation greatly. It is so comfortable. My wife and I love this product, and couldn't go another summer without it."
1,junk with very poor customer service,"this dehumidifier was ok for the first 2 months, then the thing stopped pumping out the water. I took it to the AUTHORIZED DeLonghi service center. They ""Fixed it"" but wouldn't return the box that I brought it in. It broke again (sane problem) . When I called them back, they said they were going out of business in a week. (No wonder) I called the corperate headquarters and got NOWWHERE!They said I would have to take it somewhere else. But now I had no box to carry it in, (and it's heavy, 60lbs.) I asked for a box to replace the one that their Authorized service outlet STOLE from me. They said NO, I would have to buy my own box.(This is NOT a regular, lightweight box. The machine is heavy and bulky). I asked for a repair manual in order to fix it myself, they said NO!Terrible customer service!"
1,Silent and efficient,"The pump allows me to skip emptiying the bucket twice a day. I ran the discharge hose to the AC drain, so it runs unattended. Easy setup, nice looking. It has to work almost fulltime to keep a 2,200 sq foot appt at 50% humidity, so I am not sure is a large enough unit. I have a second unit (Sears), helping out.I am afraid that after 18 months, the pump stopped working, so I can't use it anymore. Warranty is over after 1 year."
2,Plastic odor,"I was looking forward to getting our DeLonghi dehumidifyer. Good price. Pretty quick delivery and then I opened it and the oder of the plastic was so strong we couldn't keep it.My wife got an immediate headache and I couldn't take it either. We couldn't even if we put it downstairs in the basement. We had to send it back at our expense, even though we consider it defective.We went out and bought something else that works fine."
3,For those with pump problems,"I have had my unit for over 5 years now. It was around the second year that the pump failed. It would just make a clicking noise. The problem is that the in-line filter before the pump clogs with dust in the water from the coils. The solution is to disassemble the unit and remove the filter. Once that is done, you can back-flush the filter to clean it out. I also went as far as to disassemble and clean the pump out. When I reassembled the unit, I replaced the hoses attached to the filter with longer ones. That way, I will not have to disassemble the unit to clean the filter the next time. The longer hoses allow me to pull it out by removing the back grill instead of opening the case. Other than that it is a very solid unit, although somewhat noisy."
1,Do not buy DeLonghi products.,Used one summer the next summer plugged in and a code E3 came on and the unit no longer worked and no customer service.Only service centers Florida and Ohio wish I read all the bad review before I tossed away $250 dollars.They need warning labels on this product.
1,This is a piece of junk!,"This unit worked for about as long as the warrenty period then quit. The pump works when it wants to. The control panel is difficult to figure out and God help you if you loose the directions, you'll never figure it out. Sorry I ever bought it."
4,A better experience than others,"I have to admit I'm surprised by the reviews on here. I've owned three of these units for the last year and a half and have experienced minimum problems. Like most others, the main attraction for me was the automatic pump, which negates the need to keep dumping the water bucket every so often.Of the three units I've owned I've only had one major issue crop up, which is that the unit sometimes does not pump water when I've selected that option. It will simply deposit the water in the tank but I don't check these every day so when it had this issue it would stop dehumidifying when the tank was full. A minor convenience, and I can ""fix"" the problem by unplugging it and restarting it.Overall, I've been quite pleased by this unit. Obviously this is quite contrary to other reviews so pay close attention to those as well."
2,Bought 3 and returned them all.,"I was looking for a basic air line filter and this unit seemed to fit the bill. What I didn't realize until after I received the filters is that this filter has a ""self drain"" feature. The drain valve has a rubber piece that relaxes when the air pressure falls below 5 PSI (according to instructions) so beware! I never installed these units. I didn't like the idea that they would ""dribble"" all over my work bench and floor when the air pressure is drained from the lines, which I do regularly in my work shop. I bought the Campbell Hausfeld unitCampbell Hausfeld PA2121 Standard Air Filtersinstead and am happy with that unit. The Campbell Hausfeld unit appears to be the same as the Husky unit sold by Home depot. If you like black instead of blue check out the Husky unit as Home Depot. Sorry Amazon I love you more than Home Depot but I got to be honest. LOL"
3,Versatile and sturdy. Bit pricey but worth it,"The price was a bit surprising considering it was only 3 pieces, but it was definitely well spent. Rugged chassis and can fit one or two lacie hard drives. GREAT BUY!"
2,Oh Please,"Canadians are so opinionated..all about the Americans. Truth is ( I am a duel). I prefer US all the way..a more beautiful country with warm climates. I would say give it up..yes the USA is the best. You may have a more stable economy, but look at the costs of everyday items like food and gas. Besides Canadians are really snobs..for not good reason. As well, not to be offensive..but all those people from other countries!"
2,A bit too political for me,Being a Canadian living in America I was hoping this would make me proud to be a Canadian. It started off too political for my tastes so I've only been able to get to chapter 3.
3,Can of Worms is an entertaining read,"Not usually my genre, this science fiction story revolves around the life of a kid who feels a little out of place in this world. It was entertaining to read about the adventures that he had and the trouble that he got into (the satellite dish scene was my favorite).Parts of this book were slow, but not terribly so. It was full of fun and was an enjoyable book to read. If you like to read about aliens that may just be lurking out there, this book is for you."
4,con of worms,"Mike Phillsbury has built his life around the Hanzel chronides.from the time he could day dreamhe imagined ships from outerspace and epic battles between the peace-loving Hazel the vilainous Jons,and other alien landforms.he has wanted these stories not least of all his real Hanzel identity-to be true,and he's shared them with a spellbound audience of kids in his treehouse.even after his unlikely friendship with Katelyn Sands complicates matter Mike hopes there might be at home for him out there somewhere among the stars.i like this book because it is thrilling and funny and you will be suprised about what happends. and i do recommend this book."
2,"TMobile Travel Charger for Motorola KRZR, PEBL, Q, RAZR V3 Series, RIZR, SLVR, V190, V195/V197, V325, V360/V361 (Purchased on 05","I received two chargers, one charger was defective. I am still waiting for a replacement charger 30 days later. - James"
4,Fascinating look at the quintessential French queen,"I really liked this book and finished it in record time--even though I knew how MA's story would end, it was fascinating to see that she was not entirely the arrogant and unapproachable Queen of lore. Yes, she made some mistakes and was extravagant at times, but certainly no more extravagant than previous Queens of France. Minimally any reader will say after reading this book that it is sad she was a Queen who did not pay more attention outside the walls of Versailles so that she might be less oblivious--but even then, I'm not sure she could have escaped her doomed fate.The treatment of the family during their captivity and particularly the treatment of their children is startling (not to mention the legendary treatment of the Princesse de Lamballe). In the end, I'm not sure what was worse--the royal family or the revolutionaries."
5,The real Marie Antoinette,"Antonia Fraser does a wonderful job of describing what Marie Antoinette was like as a person. She shows how the young girl, who was only fifteen when she married, became the Queen of France and grew into a mature woman while in the strange environment of the Court of Versailles where privacy was unknown for the Royal family, even to the point of reports being made of her sex life with the King and when her menstrual periods occurred. It seems everyone in the court knew everything, in embarrassing detail, about the young Queen.The book explains well, however, how the Queen coped with this life on display, especially during the early years of her marriage when many ridiculed her for not producing an heir, and gives one a sense of knowing her personally. That makes the book a captivating read."
2,Tedious,"I heard so many wonderful things about this book, so was disappointed to find it so tedious. Fraser obviously did exhaustive research on her subject and I'm dying to learn more. But I'm finding the book very dry. I keep putting it down and have read several books (including David McCullough's ""Mornings On Horseback"" and Kazuo Ishiguro's ""When We Were Orphans"") while trying to get through Fraser's Marie Antoinette. I'm not sure if I'll make it."
2,Much too biased -,This book is very anti-french and pro-aristocratic and makes much effort to present the past in such light. It is incredibly tedious with overwhelming amounts of detail. The truth usually lies somewhere in between and that is certainly not what is presented here. Antonia Fraser made fiction from historic materials.
4,"If you are into female historic figures, this is a must-read","Non-fiction literature, specially historic literature, can at times be dreadfully boring and full of confusing details. This book redeems every boring historic volume I have read to date. The author hooks you in right away, and provides vivid details of Marie Antoinette's life in her early years in Austria, her teenage and adult years in Versailles, and her last years as a prisoner of the revolution. From the fabric materials and colours Marie Antoinette prefered, to various accounts reflecting her taste in elegant simplicity, entertainment, beauty and amusement, this book gives the reader a glimpse of what Marie Antoinette was like as a person, a wife, a mother, a friend, and a ruler."
3,"An excellent read, but what happened to the facts?","Like all her previous historical biographies, Antonia Fraser's MARIE ANTOINETTE is extremely well written and insightful. Unfortunately, there are pages and pages of factual errors which jump out to those of us who have read almost every book written on the queen and which lead me to question one of my fellow reviewers' comments about her ""impeccable scholarship"". Ms. Fraser even gets the location of the queen's execution wrong! Her editor must be receiving indignant letters from the queen's other biographers in droves. As always, however, a very enjoyable read."
4,"A long journey, but stick with it!","Fraser's incredibly informative biography of France's most notorious queen truly is a journey, but a vastly entertaining one at that. While a reader might be confused by all of the different names and titles, Fraser keeps the narrative interesting and her tone is much like that of a novel. While this is yet another historical personage that will be dealt with in film (Kirsten Dunst doing the honors), this biography is gripping and entertaining until the end."
5,Informative read,"As usual, Antonia Fraser does a wonderful job of presenting an historical figure's life in an interesting and thoughtful way. The historical facts and speculations are presented in a way that is never boring. She covers Marie Antoinette's life at a pace that gives the important information yet doesn't dwell on events to the point of overkill. I learned many things I had not known before about French history and MA. I was disappointed when I got to the last page--I wanted more! For those people who cringe at historical books, this one is an informative and fun read. I highly recommend it."
4,A favorable portrait of Marie Antoinette.,"If you are looking for a good histoical book on Marie Antoinette, this is it! It is well written and provides plenty of historical facts. Fraser also manages to paint a rather sympathetic portrait of Marie Antoinette as a human rather than a royal, without blurring the lines of history vs. folklore."
2,Overblown Fan Letter,"Enormously imbalanced look at this possibly misunderstood historical figure. Ms. Fraser should know so much better than she appears to with her fawning approach and refusal to deeply examine the character of Marie Antoinette. It is hard to believe that historians up until now have so overlooked all of her seemly endless good qualities according to this author. So close to sainthood M.Antoinette appears, one would think Ms. Fraser had been commissioned by her heirs. Shame on you, Mrs. Pinter."
2,Unfortunate,Antonia Fraser's work on Marie Antoinette will not be listed as one of her better works. Ms. Fraser is so obviously an Antoinette devotee. There is little to no historical objectivity in this book and there are factual errors.I am deeply disappointed in this book and in Ms. Fraser. I have come to expect better from her.
2,Boring,"I guess I thought this would be in novel form, but it was written more like a text book and I found it boring and it just didn't hold my interest. I love books from the past, but I do prefer them written as a novel."
2,Not a journey; a defense,"Antonia Fraser's tome should be entitled MA, a defense. Ms. Fraser examines the Austrian B****'s life and finds her ""not guilty."" She didn't say anything about cake, actually thought she had enough diamonds when she was 14 that she certainly didn't need the diamond necklace; she loved poor people, and on and on. Louis XVI never had surgery but gained his sexual power from two chats with the emperor. Ms. Fraser is clear about one thing, however. The AB conspired with her mother and her mother's successors to try to get France to act against the interests of Frenchmen."
1,This book is so boring-,"I couldn't finish it. It's really not a story- it is a recitation of facts. If you like that sort of thing, it's fine. B-O-R-I-N-G!!!"
2,"It was alright, I gues...","These poems were okay. But they did not rhyme. I prefer poems that rhyme. Most of these poems were about drunk cowboys. I find drunk cowboys to be scary. Like circus clowns, and homeless people. I think that Pepsi is a tastier beverage than Strohs. Pabst Blue Ribbon is good if you are trying to get really saucy, but the stool is rough the next day. Thank you reading this."
3,They get the job done...,"What can you really say about condoms in a review? They get the job done, but I don't know about that ""her pleasure"" label. They seem pretty average to my partner and I."
2,"Recipes are fine, but the book is hard to use.","All of the drinks have cute names like The Picasso, Bottoms Up, etc, which don't give a clue as to what is in the recipe. If you want to use up your last mango, for instance, you have to either page laboriously thru each recipe or memorize the book. Neither the table of contents nor the index cover the ingredients."
3,Great Smoothie Recipes,"This book, The Great American Smoothies is a great collection of recipes,Very good for the summer, and with meals. Very delicious to drink, anytime and anywhere."
3,This is good,This gameshark is good. You can get the codes of the website for every single game there is. If you get this din't use a lot of codes at once or iti'll breakk like mine. Mine lasted for about 12 days becausse i used a lot of codes because I was so excited that I was finaly going to beat the game. And yes there are codes for the pokemon stuff if you go on to www.gameshark.com then click on codes.
4,A little Advice,"As some may tell you, beware as their is a limited number of codes allowed per game, i have to buy another one because it completely crashed and wont even start up anymore. it worked out very well at the start, user friendly and did everything i asked it for. but now its just a piece of junk that doesnt work for me anymore because i went over the 5 code limit. although entering codes manually worked out fine, the preloaded codes are the issue. think before you buy as you may end up in my situation."
1,two thumbs way down,"This was a piece of junk. when I got it there was no cable, no cd and it only worked for about 15 minutes."
1,Died after the first usage,"I am shure that the idea of the product is great. But the quality of the connector ? It died after the first usage for me. After i inserted the second game, one connector bend. I tried to fix it, After fixing i inserted the cartridge again. The second connector bend. after playing that game a while, the device stopped working complete. Dead after 1 hour and 1 successful cheat. That's not what i was looking for."
1,boooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo,i got it used it got a ds used it on my ds it went boom it stinks. and u have to start game over when u use and can screw ur game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I WOULD GIVE 0STARS BUT IT DOESNT LET ME!
1,2 time loser,I bought this twice and it did not work either time. The first time it worked for about 5 minutes. The second time it worked about 15 minutes. What a horrible waste of time and money.
1,Money for Nothin',"The Gameshark only lasted 10-15 minutes! Before we bought it, it said that it would come with a CD and a USB adaptor, which it did not. DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!!!"
1,GAMESHARK SUCKS(waste of your time),"I bought this product from Best Buy a few days ago.. And I was so excited about completing my pokedex in pokemon emerald, and getting all the legendarys, that I opened it right away. Well.. guess what happened? I was about to write in a code and then it crashed on the first 2 minutes!! Then a blank screen appeared every time!! I returned it right away the next day!! Don't waste your time on this worthless item. Do it the old fashioned way and stop cheating!!"
1,PHONY GAME SHARK,I HAVE TO AGREE WITH THE LAST REVIEW. I PURCHASED THIS FOR MY SON AND THE THING IS A PHONY. IT DOESN'T WORK AND NO WHERE DOES IT HAVE GAME SHARK ON IT. THE ONLY THING SENT WAS THE PART THAT FITS IN THE GAME BOY. THERE WAS NO DISK AND NO LINK UP CABLE. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT FROM THIS VENDOR!!!!!!
2,Poor quality,"My son absolutely loved the gameshark. Sadly, the gameshark broke one week after we purchased it. My son is very disappointed."
1,Don't Buy This!,This product only worked for 2-3 days and then died. I would not recommend that anyone waste their money on this.
4,Be a Pokemon Master.,"This product is ok if you play any RPG style games. Pokemon being the best game for the gameshark. Who wants o travel (or pay for their kids trip) accross the country to attend a Nintendo convention to get one or two pokemon only obtainable through the event? Especially when you could dish out $30 instead of $400 to just do it right in the comfort of your own home?Final Fantasy is also another series that clicks well with this device.Parents, are you frustrated with hearing your kids scream and get upset over not being able to play the game without loosing? This device will help them surpass their trials and saves you the frustrated tearfilled child, and grants you a moments peace."
1,Game Disaster!,"I bought this Gameshark for my brother, but when he started to boot it up, it wouldn't start! It took about 9 tries before it started up the brogram on his Game Boy Advance SP (GBASP). But when he wanted to load the cheat onto his Emerald Pokemon Game, he loaded the cheat but when he removed the Gameshark, and booted it normally, it wouldn't start! All we saw was a white screen. So I think that the Gameshark isn't good, and the guy at GameStop in our local mall said that all of the Gamesharks are currupted and it's not reccomended."
4,Perfect!,"This thing is really cool! Totally recommed this!ANDIt works!If something happen, just shut off the power!"
2,SOULD I BUY THIS?,"Well you should buy this if you really wan't to beat the game and is the only way you think it can be done. If so goahead and buy this. I bought one and it broke within twelve days. A couple of days later called the place and told them it wouldn't even read my game anymore. They said this hapend because I put into many codes at once. I guess this happend because I got to excited that I was going to finally beat the game. If you have any proplems you should call them and not e-mail because they don't seem to read it and respond. Gameshark sp has codes for every game there is, and yes there is codes for the pokemon junck. If you buy this beawear that the internet connection won't work for some strange resone no mater if it's brand new or not. You can just go to the website and get the codes that way, It'll just be a little bit more work, if you do it this way you should use the coppy and paste methode for less work. This is easier to use then action replay."
1,!!!!! BAD !!!!!!!!,"The Gameshark for the Gameboy Advance is a jokeit will not work with any game.I have, over the years gotten gamesharks for ALLthe Nintendo consoles and gameboys, but thisone is nothing but trash. do not spend moneyon this it will not work, you are better to open thewindow toss your money out."
1,Doesn't work,"PUrchase does not work at all. We have returned item but have not heard from them ot received refund. Item was listed as ""new"" but appears to be a used item judging from packaging, lack of any wrapping or written instructions and the box looking worn, not new. I will update this review upon receipt of refund ir satisfactory replacement. As of now I am extremely upset at being out this much money for something that does not work"
1,huge Disappointment,"I'm not one to whine about games crashing when using a 3rd party program, its part of the risk you take. I will complain about beyond worthless construction. I made the mistake of buying one of these, WITHIN THREE HOURS the unit was broken due to poor construction, instead of using nice silicon chips for your game, it uses bronze maybe brass pins, very tiny, very thin, VERY BRITTLE, guess what, once they bend, its worthless, i sent it back to madcatz, got a replacement and SECOND TIME inserting a game the pins bent again. I had more fun destroying the replacement with plyers than i did the 6 hours of programming all the codes i wanted on there. Anyone foolish enough to heed my warnings, enjoy your blunder."
1,Horrible instructions. Breaks after one use.,"I purchased this for my 8yo son and he used it once and it never worked again. If you contact technical support they act like you should have read an obscure manual on their website. Website? He is 8yo! I don't let him surf the web to a site I don't even know about! They said it is very clear in this manual that you don't select more than X amount of enhancements or their product will break. Uh? Why make a product that will self destruct when an 8yo uses it?Don't buy this product. It it so fragile that even looking at it for too long will cause it to break.They refused to exchange it, only repair it and ""I"" have to pay the shipping.pu"
1,GameShark Gameboy Advance SP,"Paid 5 dollars extra to recieve the package in 1-3 days. Took 4. Came with 3 cracks and a missing button. Product itself, out of 25-30 codes I inserted, 1 worked and that was already preset. I am extremely disapointed and I am shipping the product back for a refund. Personally, I am going to switch over to the Action Replay, as it a more solid version of this. Please take my review seriously because right now it is a $60 dollar peice of broken plastic."
5,video game review,"1. Production of this item are now officially over whice means no other stores will sell, if your lucky to find one that is.2. You need to be careful when inserting your game to this device, I broke 2 and it cost me alot for replacement."
2,Too cumbersome,"The program is cumbersome to use. I never use it anymore. After I got Windows Vista, I put a [...] gadget on the desktop and use that, which is much better."
3,This read was not very inspiring. I was looking for deep revelations about prayer . What I found was a survey of different,"types of prayer. I would recommend it for someone who is just beginning their journey in prayer, but not for those who have been on a prayer journey for a long time."
5,we are one,It is one of the most valuable books i have ever read. This book hase been my repeated reading expanding my faith and deepening it.Read about his life and get more of his books.
4,Add this book to your list of must haves. Very well written. Thich tries to re-interpret scripture-not good.,"The book is very well written, easy to understand. As a Christian who also appreciates Buddhist I found this book helped me see prayer from a different perspective."
4,inspiring,"I loved this book. I always find beautiful how thich nhat hanh explains difficult concepts with simple words, and also the capacity he has to translate buddhism for western minds."
1,Too academic,"This has got to be one of the most difficult books to read. It was like swimming through a river of debris. Now and then there would be some clarity in her prose. Overall, it was way too obtuse for my taste."
5,A truly great book,An evocative and moving memoir that was sometimes painful but ultimately very rewarding to read. Absolutely one of the best books I've ever read.
1,Utter Dissapointment,"Ms Suleri perhaps falls victim to high expectations. Instead of trying to be her own self she wants to maintain B.Sidhwa's wit and Rushdie's somberness and guile in portrayal of her confused childhood.The book while appealing to a westerner wishing to get a superficial insight into a Pakistani family, is a complete waste of time for someone who has had even a slight exposure to sub continent litreature"
5,Don't miss it!,"I was 9 years old when the first Peanuts TV show aired, but I immediately recognized the piano work of my favorite jazz artist, Vince G. Not bad for a little kid, huh? I knew his music because my brother, 9 years older, had a copy of ""Black Orpheus"". It was a semi-clear red LP. As a child I loved listening to it. In Junior High I bought the LP for myself - made of boring black vinyl, not the cool red one Tom had owned - and I wore it out and bought a second copy in college. Then my wife bought the CD for me in 1986, and a new richness to the recording emerged. This remains, some 40 years after I first heard it, one of my very favorite recordings. As another writer said, if you enjoy enjoy the infectious music Vince recorded for the Peanuts specials, this CD will sound like an old friend."
5,Don't let the weird title throw you off!,"If you're not familiar with the work ""Black Orpheus"", the title may confuse you as to the nature of the music inside. Don't worry! If you have fond memories (as I do) of sitting on the living room floor and waiting for CBS ""Peanuts"" specials, and if you loved the music that accompanied them, you will deeply enjoy this work.While there is a certain Latin influence throughout, it doesn't take much listening (especially if you own any of the ""Peanuts""/Guaraldi albums) before you recognize Guaraldi's signature techniques. ""Moon River"" is a standard, but he leaves his fingerprints all over it. ""Generique"" starts off with an early '60's spy movie sort of feel, but quickly takes off in an upbeat direction. Just listen to it for yourself. Guaraldi is THE MAN!I would also add that this is the sort of work that would serve as an excellent entry level for someone who has not listened to much jazz in general, or piano jazz in particular."
4,It's fun!,"If you ever wanted to grow up to be Schroeder (from Charlie Brown), listen to this CD. Vince Guaraldi was the guy behind the Charlie Brown music. This CD has plenty of delightful jazz piano tunes."
2,It has it's moments,"We all know that actors tend to come across as narcissistic, and this doesn't do much to dispel that myth. The show has it's moments, but sadly they are just to far and few to really recommend it. Not only do the actors portraying themselves seem narcissistic, so does the shrink. I would avoid this show at all costs."
1,There's some humor I just don't get...,"It's not that the show was offensive to me, or to any particular group or anything. But it just doesn't seem funny. It seemed stupid - the kind of, ""come on, nobody is THAT stupid"" kind of humor."
2,Basically offensive,"I suppose my review is biased because I am a psychiatrist (and I do psychotherapy for a living). I'm not sure what this is supposed to represent: the way psychotherapists supposedly make money on their clients while being entirely incompetent, or the way that clients are so stupid and ignorant that they think this IS the way psychotherapy is supposed to work. It's not funny, just horrifying. The therapist is a blond bimbo who looks like she got her training in massage school, and I don't think she would know what psychotherapy is except to listen to people talk and offer them completely pointless advice while breaking every HIPPA law in existence. Far from enjoying this and laughing at its silliness, I felt like recycling this DVD, as I'm sure it would make more use in the next life when its ingredients had been remade. Whose idea was this?? Needless to say I don't recommend it."
5,HEAD CASE SEAS,This is a show that I am able to watch over and over and enjoy. The characters are so believable I have to remind myself they are actors and not the characters they portray but so very funny.
2,not quite,"A would-be ""outrageous"" series about a therapist for celebrities with an oddball staff (including a one-armed assistant) and a parade of celeb guests who parody themselves. This ain't no Garry Shandling, but it is nice to see Steve Landesberg of Barney Miller back in action. Visit me at michaelgiltz dot com."
2,Could be a lot funnier...,"I was unfamiliar with ""Head Case,"" but thought it sounded like a funny idea. Maybe it still is, but the show itself isn't particularly. The problem is that all of the characters, including many of the celebrities who play themselves, are all so spectacularly clueless that there's no grounding in reality, thus no real comic contrast. Nearly every character (except for the dryly amusing Steve Landesberg) is so self-obsessed that the show inspires more disbelief than humor. Add to that the fact that much of it is the result of improvisation rather than the kind of sharp writing that makes superior comedy like 30 Rock (in which the self-obsessed characters are actually funny, even endearing), and you've got a recipe for real hit or miss comedy. The problem is that Head Case misses more than it hits. Admittedly, I only watched five episodes, but as a critic once said, you don't have to eat the whole egg to know it's bad."
3,Nicely done but Season 0 just isn't worth it on VOD/Instant Video,"A great series, but know that Season 0 is comprised of 12-15 minute ""mini"" episodes, each of which will cost you $1.99 (or get a slight discount for the whole season) from VOD/instant video sources (including Amazon)... not a good value. These should actually be half-priced but aren't."
3,I enjoyed the cameos more than the show,"Head Case is a Starz show about Dr. Elizabeth Goode, a psychiatrist to the stars who could use a little therapy of her own. She shares her office with another therapist, whose practice isn't nearly as successful as her own, her one-handed handyman, and her British assistant who often speaks before she thinks. The show, while funny, was a bit jarring to me, and I found myself enjoying the celebrity cameos more than the show itself. I like actors who can laugh at themselves, and that seemed to be the name of the game with all of Dr. Goode's clients. The rest of the show, I could take or leave. I had a couple of laugh out loud moments, but not as many as I would have liked. If you want a show in the same arena, that consistently delivers the laughs, I'd suggest you check outCurb Your Enthusiasm - The Complete First Seasoninstead."
4,"Crude, but so funny!","I didn't expect to like Headcase when I first started to watch it. It takes a few episodes before you ""get to know"" the characters. I'd never heard of the show before, and I was surprised to see all the actors playing themselves...not really themselves, but bizarre representations of themselves as they visit Dr. Goode (Alexandra Wentworth), a Hollywood therapist. Dr. Goode happens to be unprofessional, self-involved, and mentally unstable herself, but somehow she's able to keep her clients coming back. Some of them include Jeff Goldblum, Jonathan Silverman, Alanis Morrisette, and Ralph Macchio.This is a very funny series, in a dark and goofy sort of way. Wait until the kids are gone to bed to watch this one too....lots of four letter words and sex talk."
3,"I didn't think I liked it, but I couldn't stop laughing.","I didn't think I liked it, but I couldn't stop laughing. That pretty much sums up this show in the vein of Arrested Development. Head Case is a show about a psychiatrist office, it's tenants and their clients/daily struggles to succeed, interact and feel needed by those around them. What makes this show tick is the off beat, self absorbed doctor who has managed to become the psychiatrist to the stars, when she is clearly doing more damaged than good. The show is well written, well acted, and pack with uncomfortable moments that keep you gasping for air, and reeling in shock. The Show's downfall is that Unlike Arrested Development, or the other shows I have seen Head Case compared to, you never become endeared to the main character, and rather then root for her success and cringe at her awkwardness, you just pray that the other characters will run away for the sake of their own sanity."
4,Funny look at celebrity psychological treatment,"I never saw this show on the air, but am happy I found it on DVD. It is a light, funny look at celebrities and show-business types(not really A-list ones, either.) They act in silly, shallow ways, even a little stereotypical here and there (not consistently), but it doesn't really belittle them or the psychological profession. They ALL seem like they they have some things to work out, and just act as their, wacky, imperfect selves. The lead character (Alexandra Wentworth) plays the therapist (Dr. Elizabeth Goode) who has plenty of her own problems and mental health needs.A non-serious farce type-look at the main character's psychological practice, similar to how ""The Office"" is a look at the goings-on in a business environment. It is a fun little show."
4,A SHRINKING feeling,Alexandra Wentworth and Steve Landesberg star in this series about shrinks. I think this is Fraiser with an edgeThis Starz cable channel show is enjoyable in small doses. So when watch this box set dont watch it all at once.Otherwise this is cute and full of laughes. It is better thanDr. Katz: Seasons 1 and 2 DVD Bundleany day of the year.Bennet Pomerantz AUDIOWORLD
5,The Pilgramage,"Having driven Interstate Hwy 80 over the Donner Pass many times and knowing the story of that wagon train, reading this book brought an insight into the actual travel adventures of women especially those traveling as these two half sisters with their mission as the driving force to their destination. The scriptures included in the story bring many thought provoking moments as to the girls interpretations and the predicaments they encounter. I rate this book highly. Thank you for a wonderful read---however I have heard this book via audio."
1,"Ordered DV-516E, got DV-516D","I ordered the ""TEAC DV-516E 16x Internal IDE Black DVD-ROM Drive"" and got a box labeled ""DV516E/KIT/B"" but inside was a drive labeled ""DV-516D"". The DV-516D has a 256KB data buffer, not the 512KB data buffer that I expected when I ordered the DV-516E. The DV-516D worked well enough, but I decided to return it because of the deceptive packaging."
1,Not very Happy,"Worked fine for first couple of months. Now, we have to shake it once every day to get the ""service"" lite to go off."
2,"Great beginning, but...","Great beginning, but I felt like it kind of fell apart after awhile, or swirled down into a dream world.That doesn't have to be a bad thing, but I felt like it didn't really work in this volume. It started out a very modern, woman-fiction, barely-fantasy-at-all kind of story about an angry, overweight lady whose husband left her for a young blonde. When she finds a talking frog who says ""kiss me, I'm a prince,"" she's like, ""No thanks, I'd rather have a talking frog!""How can you lose with that, right?But somehow, the later part of the book didn't work for me. It became a lot more about the lady's daughter, choices, and this sort of dream-world with a wicked witch character as the villain.I just got the feeling Nancy Springer got bored with the book, and sort of wrote the last 2/3 of it in a rush, too fast, and didn't bother re-working it.I didn't like that feeling."
1,The author is an idiot,If I could I would give this book negative stars. It's a crappy book and it's trying to blame Shannen for who her character was. The author of this book is a sick person who was probably just looking for some quick cash
1,shut up!!!,brenda walsh is the best character of 90210 it pisses me off how everyone acts like they hated her in reality if it wasnt for her the 90210 show wouldnt of been a hit at all!!! im sorry but kelly taylor in my opinion was the most annoying of them all her laugh alone pierced my ears it sounded like she was a fat lil kid trying 2 breath when she would laugh its just ridiculous how everyone makes brenda sound like a bitch when everyone can relate 2 her more then anyone on the show!!! kelly was a backstabbing bitch who stole dylan from brenda wut kind of best friend does that brenda wasnt overreacting at all she was reacting how anyone would and she was only dramatic because of how the people around her made her feel!!!
3,Lots of other discrepancies,"The figure pictured also doesn't seem to be wearing earrings, nor does it appear to be ""floating"" by being cleverly supported by costume elements (other than shoes on the ground). I'm thinking either the picture or description has been swapped with one for Dokuro-chan by mistake... or maybe intentionally as a viral meme, as there couldn't possibly be more of a difference between their personalitites."
3,Afterthoughts Make Poor Subjects,"I have read nearly every book in print about WHT. Pringle's effort is quintessential. Pringle begins his treatment by admitting that his interest in Taft is superficial: He decided to write these books only after completing works on Teddy Roosevelt. Taft is usually treated as a moon to Roosevelt's planet. Pringle typifies this treatment. One gets the impression that Pringle is a lifeguard forced to rescue a man whom he loathes. In the end, the entire effort devolves into an apologia. The lifeguard, after struggling against the currents of his own indifference, pulls his lifeless charge to shore, explaining to a hostile crowd: ""Every man, even this loathsome creature, deserves a chance."" He then walks away while Taft turns blue. I give this book three stars because it is better than nothing, but just barely."
5,Excellent Case!!!,"I must say I read the first reviewer's notes about this case prior to buying it and I was a bit concerned about the quality. I don't know what exactly one should expect for the quality of a computer case, but I'm very impressed after seeing it. Yes the case is heavier that the cheap cases we see everywhere. I think this is pretty normal because it's a full tower and it has a big metal skelaton. I agree that this might not be the perfect fit for a gamer who goes to LAN parties all the time.If you need a cool looking case and you want to fit in many devices while keeping the temperature low, this is the case for you. I put in a power supply, the motherboard, 5 hard drives, 1 cd writer, 1 floppy and 3 fans (2 is included with the case). None of them is getting in the way of the other. The air circulation inside is much better than a normal computer case..."
2,Damaged By UPS,Antec PlusView1000AMG Metallic Gray SOHO File Server is one of the best cases with lots of room for major upgrades. Do not have this Product shipped UPS Ground due to the fact mine was so damaged it didn't even look like a computer case. make sure you have it shipped 2day air or express

1,Great if you want a scrap book.,"I bought these caps in the hopes of using them to cap my recent batch of beer. What I ended up getting were caps that are nice and shiney but have no use on my bottles. I had to make a rushed trip around town to find bottles with the lever tops so my beer wouldn't be lost. They look just like the real thing but when it came down to putting them on my bottles and crimping them they don't hold up. out of 34 bottles of beer I used 67 caps, that's nearly twice what it should have been. The ones that did end up taking caps didn't hold the pressure of carbonation. They didn't explode but instead leaked so I had nearly flat beer in a few bottles. Moral of the story: Scrapbooking/Crafts a pretty good deal for nice looking caps, Home brewer: Highly not recommended."
5,They work,"There really isn't much more to say, they work well and look pretty good. No issues putting them on bottles."
5,Good value!,"My hubby does home brewing and needed more caps, a great value, will purchase again when we need some more!"
3,Lots of Editorial from the Author,"The Author does bring up things to think about, but also offers much opinion. I like to form my own opinions. But I applaud his hard work for bringing this to our attention. Maybe one day this stuff will be mainstream knowledge."
3,O scale train log cabin,"This log cabin is very nice looking and adds a nice touch to my grandson's O guage train set. However, it really needs to be glued together to not fall apart."
5,Gitzo Steel Spike,"I am a photographer, it is a Gitzo product, we walk hand in hand. The spike fits my monopod perfectly, helps to anchor my monopod and steady my camera."
2,Did not work on volleyballs.,"Was hopeful that this might work on volleyballs. Our schnauzer managed to bite a tiny hole in two of them. We used a glue injector to put about an ounce of puncture seal in the volleyballs before filling them up. As soon as we put a little air pressure in them, the puncture seal comes out of the hole. Too bad -- would have been very useful."
1,Appalling,"If you are interested in a collection of quotes from the stupidest and least interesting reality shows, this is the book for you. Not what I was looking for."
5,Gift from God,"Lit with the same ineluctable fire as the best of Shakespeare, Chekov, David Berkowitz, and Ada Louise Huxtable. What does ineluctable mean?"
2,Ummm....,"The change in the lead male character J.D. was just too sudden for me. One minute he's a jerk, and the next minute he's Maddy's dream man? It just didn't feel real, it felt very contrived, and I didn't enjoy it as much as I have with other Harlequins. I would skip this one."
1,"Warning: this is a bare unit, not a KIT as stated!","As the heading states: ""TEAC DV-516EKITB 16x Internal IDE Black DVD-ROM Drive Kit with PS2"".What arrived in the box was a completely bare drive packaged in bubble wrap. No cable, no manual, nothing. What kit? Plus, it came in the boring color Beige, not Black as stated.If you do a search online or from the manufacturer web site, the model designation is in fact a color Black DVD-ROM retail package with the usual manual....Don't be fooled by the [inexpensive] price, that's because it's only an OEM. If you're looking for retail, then invest in better brands like Sony, Toshiba, etc just for a little more."
3,"Good, basic IDE DVD drive","It is what it is. I got it to replace a CD-ROM drive in a Dell Dimension 2400 that I've turned into a Windows Home Server box; it runs noisy enough that I disconnected it after I used it to install the OS, but other than that it did the job. For the price, if you need an IDE drive, it does the job."
2,Supposedly new,"I received this cap without any protective wrapping. it looked old and used. It was also dirty. I didn't buy a ""vintage"" cap, I bought a new cap."
5,Great little bench,"Purchased this bench over a year ago for use in my garden. Wanted a small sturdy bench that could be used for working on my garden but was also attractive. This bench is perfect. It went together quickly and has proven to be very sturdy (I'm no lite-weight). It is a comfortable height, stands solidly, but is easy to move around. Has been outside in all kinds of weather. Large enough to be comfortable; small enough to move; looks good tucked into a curve of my landscaping. I wish they made a longer version, 3 to 4 feet long, so I could have one for permanentseating in another location."
3,"Matches my blue hearts corelle, but measure it","When I bought these I was only thinking of it being able to fit around my burners. They aren't very deep so they sit above the stovetop, doesn't look too good. I don't know why thy aren't made deeper, seeing as they are supposed to be for gas burners"
3,Could have been better,"It looked so great on my burner if only one of them fit exactly on the big one. My stove has 3 small burners and 1 big. It was quarter of an inch smaller than my big burner. I tried to pull the sides to barely fit it --- it's not square anymore it has curves on the side like this ( ).If you are going to buy this, make sure you measure your burner."
3,Review of Turtle Sundial,As a lover of turtles this was perfect for me. Although it is very nice it isn't as heavy and as durable as I originally thought it would be. But I'm sure it will make the perfect addition to my garden.
3,"Not bad, but flawed...","The Palm belt clip case for the i705 bears similarities to other Palm belt clip cases - it has a large, rigid clip on the back with no swivel mechanism. The i705 slides down into an elastic sided sleeve, holding it securely. There are four slots for memory cards in the flap and a rather tight slot behind that for cash or a credit card or two.Palm says you can HotSync the i705 while in the case. Yes, you can, but not with a cradle - you will have to use a separate cable as the unit will not sit in a cradle while in the case.Amazingly, there is no cutout on the sleeve for either the power button or the memory card. You can turn on power by pushing an application button, but turning it off again is much trickier.The leather is nice and soft, and the case looks as if it will protect the unit nicely. It's also slimmer than the ""slim leather case""."
3,Good index of basic best practices,"This little book contains a lot of chess nuggets, some of which may come across as very obvious, some as reminders of forgotten truths, and others will certainly increase your arsenal of chess skills. Even when stating the obvious, the key is to apply all 200 truths consistently and at the right time!My only complaint with this book is that the author always uses examples of his own games in which he did the right thing. It would have made him seem a bit less pretentious had he also included a smattering of examples where he was on the receiving end of one of these chess/life lessons."
5,Everything I needed to Know in Life I Learned from Chess,"That could've been the title for this delightful book. Those expecting master-level depth of analysis should look elsewhere; this book makes no pretentions to being a course in chess mastery.I volunteer as a chess coach at an elementary school. I always stress the value of the life-skills that chess teaches. This book has not only validated my approach, but given me many new ideas on how to enrich these children's lives through chess. Thanks, Mr. Kurzdorfer!And, yes, I learned some useful chess tips from this book as well. The positions were interesting and well explained (at least for someone at an average club-level of play.)I've read hundreds of chess books: this one ranks in my top ten."
4,"Back to basics. Win, then apologize!","It's reminded me to go back to basics.I learned the elements long ago and, in an independent streak? Have begun defying some of these concepts....and losing more often! So, back to controlling the center....and I must start using those bishops.I love the advice, ""Chess is not for the softhearted."" Save the empathy for AFTER you beat them!Excellent book."
3,The Tao of Chess,"Has anyone not noticed that Principle 173 is missing? I don't know how to get a hold of the author but if he decides to do a reprint, it would be good to have. I thought he made a good effort in correlating principle of chess with principles of life."
2,Too ambitious for a little book.,"Besides a couples of well-known and less-known principles, the rest is just like Collins' Maxims of Chess. Even older, Maxims has better analysis. There are not much Taos or life in this book. I couldn't find Taos. With many times reading, I found some Well-hidden applications for life. I got Mammoth World Greatest Chess Games the same time for 12.95 USD; comparing the quality, Tao of Chess is worth about 2.25 USD.Good luck to all, if you find more Tao and Life then I do."
3,"Good product, missing screw","The product arrived quickly and in perfect conditions. The disadvantage is the package does not include the screw to attach the weight to the camera. So, it's still sitting unused since I cannot find where to buy this special screw! I cannot get it online for some reason! Wouldn't be easier to charge 2 more bucks and add the screw to the package??"
4,A Handy Addition,"This Buoyancy Control Weight is very handy to keep your camera, strobe and/or video light buoyant while diving. Although a bit pricey, it does the job perfectly. If you only purchase the weight, you will not receive the screw, which can be purchased from Sealife separately. If you have the SeaLife DC1200 MAXX Duo Camera Set, SeaLife DC1200 MAXX 12MP Digital Underwater Camera & Dual Strobe Packa orSealife Dc1200 Elite Underwater Camera, they come with the screw already. In fact you will need the longer screw with a strobe and video light, but that usually is included in the kits."
3,Strong FM But Weak on AM,"I ended up giving away my KA1107 because I could not get over the weak muffled sound on AM. FM was fine but at this price point I expected more. For the same money, the Sony ICF-M410V delivers more bang, giving equal FM, better AM and a digital format with presets. If you need shortwave, you're better off spending a little more and getting the Kaito 1103."
1,Machine error 41,"I have owned the MPC442C and got a error 41 over the weekend. It said call Brothers immediately. I call and was on hold for only 21 minutes. They said I was out of warranty and nothing could be done. I have about 8 ink cartridges in my desk new and thought of buying another Brothers machine to be able to use them, but not after research and this treatment. I am not going to buy another Brothers because of this poor customer service."
2,Good but Ink Eater,"Works good with all features, but usage of Ink is aweful. I bought it 6 months ago, and printed like 50 pages max, and it ran out of INK. INK is very expensive compared to the actual printer price. Dont buy it."
1,Garbage,"Do not buy this printer unless you really feel the need to waste money. If I could give it zero stars, I would. I have had this printer for less than a year. If any of the cartridges goes out it will not allow you to print at all. Tonight, I went out and bought replacement cartridges at the sum of $40. Came home and installed them. The printer will only tell me that there are no cartridges installed. Won't even let me use the cleaning utility. I recommend that you think twice before buying any Brother product."
1,Do Not Buy,Any money you save on the cheap price you will more than make up for paying for ink. I get 5+/- one to two page faxes a week and go through a black ink cartridge every 2 months and have to replace the color catridges every 3-4 months. The machine virtually disables itself if any ink cartridge runs low. You can't even use the scan functions. In addtion the machine forces you to change them when ther is ink clearly visible in the cartridges they are not empty.
1,Avoid at all costs!!,"Like another reviewer stated, this thing becomes no more than a paperweight after the ink runs out. It does not print unless ALL cartridges are full, even if you are ok with black and white only!! I recently bought a new set of ink cartridges, and in less than a month the printer will not function since the yellow is empty. This is absurd. Brother should be issuing out refunds for this thing. I also own a 7 year old HP Deskjet, which, even with its age, is my only reliable printer in the house."
2,Goodwill bound,"I used this model as a scanner. Mechanically, it was fine and delivered image quality consistent with resolution specs. There is no reason to believe that it would not have worked equally well as a fax machine.But the driver used to force my OS to crash (XP Professional) and perform a defensive memory dump about once every week or 10 days. I understand that no one is perfect, and tried a couple of times to locate driver updates but there were none available. Unacceptable. If you buy this machine, throw the the driver disk out so it can't interact with your operating system. I really shouldn't have waited this long. Buy one used, at best, obviously.I switched to an HP Officejet J4550 for feeder-scanner purposes, and have experienced no problems with the driver."
1,ink wasting paperweight,"Ignore the low price -- you'll more than pay for it seveal times over by the scandalous ""automatic self cleaning"" mechanism that drinks ink like a wino drinks ripple. I hardly ever use color and have ""run out"" of color ink 3 times in six months. I'd be happy just to use B&W;, but the printer won't work unless you replace all the cartridges. This should be illegal...There is no solution to this problem. Even if you turn off the machine, it automatically cleans itself. If you unplug the machine, it cleans itself when you plug it back in. My cat doesn't clean himself this much.The machine also developed a software glitch early on, where it would print half a page of what you want, spit it out, then print all of what you want. Another design to waste ink?Finally, the paper capacity is miniscule, so you'll be constantly moving the flimsy, easily breakable paper tray in and out.In other words, DON'T BUY THIS MACHINE!!!"
1,Software glitch,"We initially bought this for scanning purposes (and not as a fax machine or copier or printer). The scanner when it works, works like a champ. But if you develop a problem with it, no matter how many computer you switch this to..the product has a problem with the 'feeder' as i was told by Office depot. They have received a few back from customers. I'd invest in another brother product."
2,OKAY - but with PROBLEMS,"I got this item for a job i was doing. I had to copy and scan several hundred documents. I will say that it did that with ease and the resolution was not bad either. BUT - watch out for the printer part of this thing. It is not that great. First off, i would suggest that brother really get it together with their ports. The USB port is located *inside* the machine. It is really easy to close the lid and cut the cord if you wire it the wrong way - so maybe having it *outside* like all other printers would be a thought. Next the tray is all messed up and doesn't load right. When i try to load paper i am serious that the tray doesn't even fit in any grooves. It seems poorly designed. Then there was this big fin type of thign that i don't know *what* was for and just threw it out. The paper also gets jammed frequently. So in all, this thing is not a bad document scanner or copier. That part is pretty darn good actually. The software is not bad either. But the printer part sucks."
3,A good read,"I really enjoyed this novel. The heroine is as intelligent and insightful as she was described to be; the author relates her character so well that I truly understood her desire to become a spy and finally obtain the chance to shape history. The hero, on the other hand, wasn't as well-fleshed out. The spy plot, developed amidst the Congress of Vienna, was intriguing--the villianess's plans caught me by surprise when they were finally unvealed. I recommend this!"
4,Hindu commentary on Taoist document,"This is a great translation, for all the reasons others have stated. However I was extremely disappointed to find that a large percentage of the comments on the text are from Hinduism!For example the comment on entire comment on verse 69 talks about the Bhagavad Gita and Krisha! It barely mentions the Tao te Ching passage but instead is 10 sentences about Lord Krisha, the Pandava Princes, and dharma. The commentary on the next Tao te Ching verse, 70, consists of nothing more than a quote from ""Mysticism in India"".In the first three pages alone, five Hindu texts are quoted at length! For a few moments I wondered if there was a printer's screwup which caused pages of a commentary about Indian religion to be added to the Tao te Ching book.Besides being confusing, this heavy use of terms from other religions gives concern that the author has a theory that Taoism is just the Chinese version of Hinduism, and tilted his book that way."
1,Simplistic Drivel,"Don't waste the 30 minutes it takes to read (and absorb!) these 'truths'. They are so basic and incomplete that it is like being told to ""look both ways before crossing the street"". The writing is heavy-handed and arrogant, and has none of the charm or insights of the ""What I Learned in Kindergarten"" books. Though overcoming childhood adversity and earning a degree is admirable, it doesn't make someone an 'expert'. Use your own common sense: find a different book written with expertise that has insight and value."
1,Don't Waste Your Money or Time on This!,No insights. Nothing worth the time or money...even for a tiny book. A one trick pony that repeats one simple concept page after page. A disappointment.
4,Real life gets real simple,MiMi has the proper foundation of life's challenges mixed with a solid education to help you look at your life without filters. This is definitely a book you will want to share with your work associates and friends-just make sure and buy them their own copy. Yours will be highlighted and have important scribbles and notes all through it as you discover your own truths! I have already given one copy away and I am buying a copy for each of my other 15 employees!
2,not intuitive,"It does the job but is not intuitive. You'll never know exactly when the system will turn on since there is no clock to set. It is based on relative time, like `it will start x amount of hours from now'."
5,Works great -- buying another as a gift,"Have had this unit 3 or 4 years now (actually, my wife says it may be 5 or 6 years, and she may be right). Always bring it in in the late fall and remove the batteries. It's never failed me or had a problem."
2,water hose timers,"I purchased two of these timers. They don't have a provision to set the day, the hour, run time or for how long. You never know when the water will come on. I would not encourage anyone to purchase these type of timers. Having said this, I am partial to the Melnor brand as opposed to Orbit."
1,Didn't work at all!,I would not recommend this. From the moment I first put batteries in it all it would do was open and close the valve over and over and then would beep a bunch and then repeat opening and closing the valve. I was very irritated that it didn't work since I was going out of town the next day and needed my garden to be watered while away. So I had to go waste my time packing it up and taking it to the post office to return it to Amazon. But of course Amazon was great with return and refund. I went to Wal-Mart and bought the one and only timer that they carry and it has worked great for what I need. (so far...but at least it works!) It was also $10.00 cheaper than this one.
3,A basic primer,"A nice outline, however not much more information than is provided by most Graduate studies prep notes. For the level of information and substance, I felt the price was much to high."
3,Better Packing,"I just want to say although it was only 14.00 dollars should I be upset that mycover was bent and torn. Yes I should ,the packing was not done correctly now mybook looks used,When it was supposed to be new.I brought a used book that lookedbrand new.Excellence in Business (3rd Edition)"
3,"Pretty interesting, as far as textbooks go","Obviously, I bought this textbook for a class that I'm taking. As far as textbooks go, it is pretty interesting and well written.This seller was fabulous!"
3,It was alright.,"Item was shipped within a reasonable amount of time. I would have liked to have a tracking number, so I could tell where it was. The shape of the book was a little rougher, than it was described. It said good condition, however it had highlighted pages, and pretty banged up on the exterior."
3,good quality textbook...bad shipping timing,"I paid for expedited shipping,and really needed the textbook on time. It took 8 days to get to me.That is not expedited!!!!.Did I pay for something I didn't get? the texbook itself was in good shape. clean, no markings."
2,"OK ideas, insipid writing, only aimed at parents of the very young.","Want to get the gist of this book without wasting time reading it? Check out the table of chapters. Because that's about as in-depth a discussion of the ideas to be had in the pages that follow.The ideas about how to make life better for you & your kids aren't bad ones; they're sort of no-brainers (except the author has serious issues against watching TV, regardless of how, or if, the themes and issues presented are discussed or explained by parents to their children). What is striking about the way they're presented. It doesn't take long before you realize that each paragraph consists of one idea presented, reworded, and reworded again. The final sentence in each chapter is also the title of the chapter.The author also doesn't seem to have in mind any but the preschool set, as if raising children is the same at every age or new issues don't rise when kids are in high school."
5,One of the best parenting books around,"This is one of those books that I have highlighted all over the place and one of those that I will refer to time and time again. Thank you, Dr. Griffin for a very helpful book."
4,You won't be able to put down Night Creature,"When I first picked up this book I was disappointed that it was at third grade reading level. However, as I started into it, I couldn't put it down! I'm now hooked on the series after finishing this book in 2 hours. I recommend that the faster readers buy the whole set to satisfy the craving you will undoubtedly develop with this book. It is first person, so you really see what goes on in the werewolf's head. Also, it portrays werewolves as having innate evil, and the story is mostly about how the main character fights against his instincts to kill."
5,2GB (2x1GB) Kingston PC2100 Registered ECC Memory Kit (p/n KTH-ZX2000-2G),"Be aware this is registered ECC RAM, typically used in servers. Make sure it will work in your system before buying."
4,Old Soldiers - New Entertainment,"Novel is based on the Bolo SuperTank theme with some new twists and is very much worth the read. Readers of David Weber's ""Path of the Fury"" will recognize some things which were relatively new to his stories in that book.The hero of this novel is the supertank and the heroine is the tank commander.By the time the fighting (which is very well done) is over the two have ""A LOT in common"" to say the least. To tell much more would give away too much of the story, but I highly recommend it to Weber SF readers and to anyone who likes Military SciFi."
3,Great Performance of Solist but foggy sound of Choir,I like the performance of Bruno Walter. His performance has some profound atmosphere and his Mozart is superb. His performance has some gentleness and womanlike softness. It makes someone who hear his performance feel as being taken upto beyond the heavenly place. But this performance is something disappointed. The sound of Choir in the introduction is heard somewhat like that I am hearing music behind the curtain. But the performance of the solist is very good.
1,Hope you are a carpenter.,"Do not buy this product unless you have woodworking skills and tools. Bench came without any directions, no big deal I'm a handy guy. Figured out how everything went together only to find that several support pieces were cracked and all of the holes for the bolts did not line up correctly. After glueing and clamping the cracked pieces I re-drilled all of the bolt holes. Too much effort for a pine bench that's not very sturdy."
3,"good, could have been better","the problem of errors in the books answer keys did detract from its value. in addition the graphical scheme of the book could have been more appealing. though it's an aesthetic complaint, the blues and greys got to be a bit difficult after long reading."
1,This is just terrible,"this is the worst toy i ever bought when Isaw it looked nothing like the picture it was tiny and ugly and it smelled terrible Ifelt like puking right on the weird thing.It dident resemble a pig at all. The website is also terrible Icouldent figure out how it works. Also on the website there is a slot machine game that enourages to gamble when I grow up. Dont bother to buy this worthless toy.Dont evan consider it. this was a waste of my money.Insted of buying this your other options could be the scorpian action figer from mortal combat, The interactive spiderman and new goblin and a psp.you can also take in consideration of a super socker such as the artic frost or a plain ugly doll just dont buy this toy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Awesome Toy,I highly reccomend this toy. It is cute and educational. And somebody wrote a review that said that it's stupid and ugly. THAT IS NOT TRUE!!!! The wishing well game does not encourage gambling because you do not lose any KinzCash (Webkinz Money). I know this considering I have almost 20 webkinz and play the wishing well every day. Plus I don't think it's very nice to write the same review a bunch of times just so the item won't get a lot of stars. So if your thinking about buying this item please do because it't educational and a lot of fun. :)
5,Webkinz are FUN!,"Love Webkinz; most games are just 'fun' but there's quizzes, math games and typing games available that are fun as well"
3,okay movie,its okay I just think for kids watching that they shouldnt have the boy running around with out cloths on.
4,Fun family flick,We have an almost 8 year old who likes the books. It was entertaining for the adults and our daughter.
4,The kids love it!,"The kids love this movie, I've sat through it like 4 times already. It is cute and there are some funny parts."
4,Not bad!,"I loved this series and read them all even though I was a high school senior.The first part of the movie seeing Greg doing those stuff just felt really dumb, but hey, prob every man in the world at that age done things stupid like that to get the attention of the cute girl in class.Overall this is a great movie, met my expectation and made me crack a bit."
5,Great for kids and grandkids,If you're looking for a good family movie -- or just a couple of hours of quiet while your kids or grandkids are occupied -- this is worth getting. (You might even enjoy it yourself.)
5,Diary of a Wimpy Kid,"Great fast service, with product exactly as described. Made my nine year happy to get it. Will definitely buy from you again."
4,10 and up,"As with most children's movies not made by pre Disney Pixar, this has so much adult humor that can be mistaken for behavior to model, showing it to children who do not have a very firm purchase on what is right and wrong is risky. That said it is a funny movie."
1,Do not buy this Blu-ray!,"Had to exchange the first copy of this Blu-ray I received because the video playback stuttered. The replacement I received also did stuttered, and on multiple Blu-ray players."
4,AWESOME FILM,"I'm the son of Anm Rahman, and I have to say, this movie was better than the first! It had everything a good movie should have:1. Good direction2. Good script3. Good acting4. Funny gagsI find it's a good movie, and I absoulutly LOVE the shorts. I complain though, that it's not really faithful to the book (e.g., the scene where Rodrick picks up Greg and Rowley, only Greg was picked up AND Rodrick didn't have a friend accompany him). Otherwise, great movie!"
3,Won't play: EDIT Won't play on older DVD players,"I've received two copies of this Blu-Ray/DVD and still haven't been able to get the DVD to play. We don't have a Blu-Ray player yet, so I can't comment on the quality of the movie itself at this point. :) The DVD when inserted starts buzzing wickedly and won't load on either a stand-alone DVD player or my computer drive. I now notice Amazon has yanked its inventory but it was enough work to get an exchange on the first one, so I'm not sure what I'll do at this point. Bought it for $10.99 on Thanksgiving and there's no way I'll find that price now. To Amazon's credit, they did refund the difference to me to basically get me an even exchange, but now that the second one is bad too I'm not sure I want to risk it again.EDIT: just wanted to add that the included DVD does play on my PCs DVD drive and also on a newer stand-alone, so it must just have issues with older DVD players."
2,Greg's mom rule's??,"I really liked the first movie. Bought the first DVD, have all the books. In the first movie, I thought all the casting and acting were good with the exception of Greg's mom. She was the character I liked the least in the first movie. That was one of several problems with the sequel. The character of Greg's mom has the largest and least interesting part in the second film.The story was flat and felt phoned in. The acting was good but the actors had nothing to work with due to a boring, uninspired script. I wont be buying this one. Im guessing the woman who plays Greg's mom is either related to one of the writers or the producers owes her money."
5,DVD,"WIMPY KID, IS SOME OF THE CUTEST STORIES FOR KIDS. MY GRANDSONS LOVE THE BOOKS AND MOVIES. THEY WATCH THESE OVER AND OVER. FUNNY AND ENTERTAINING FOR PARENTS TO WATCH ALONG. ENJOYABLE FOR KIDS AND ADULTS."
5,Bought for nephew,My 9 year old nephew read this book almost in one setting and that is not normal for him to do. He loved it!
4,Good price,My son loves this movie and owns the first one. This was a great price for $4 and a great stocking stuffer.
4,Very Funny,"Funny, good movie for family. Rodrick rules in this one.Better than 1st movie. Shows a good side offamily coming together."
3,Fun to see something for my 11-year-old grandson that isn't about shooting.,This has appeal for the 10-15 year-olds. The kids are really good at putting things over on their parents. They get new ideas in case they don't think of those things themselves. It is realistic and the kids are no plaster saints.
4,The first one was the best,"I enjoyed the first Diary of a Wimpy Kid movie so much that I got the books to read to my son. The books are hilarious, this movie was just not my favorite of them. My kids thought it was hysterical though so that made it better."
4,Movie,This was my first time renting from the tv/computer and watching instantly at home without having to go anywhere. The quality and sound were not completely clear. But otherwise great and hilarious film! Loved it!
2,"Cute phone, a few glitches","Pros: Very compact, sleek and cool, sharp screen, very affordable.Cons: Buttons are WAY too small (i frequently mis-dial), battery dies VERY quickly (re-charge every 3 days?! crazy).I'm ready to ask for a return, awesome looking phones only go so far."
2,"Poor call quality, expensive prepaid rate","Picked this up from Radio Shack as a novelty item. The phone is thin, but the call quality is quite poor. Virgin Mobile uses Sprint's PCS network, and Sprint is my primary provider (I have a new Sanyo M1 phone), and the call quality difference is huge. The keypad is also uncomfortable to use, like many ultra-thin phones -- just not designed for normal human beings IMHO. Finally, VM's prepaid rate is just too high. Coupled with limited coverage, I'd say VM's service is a bad deal."
2,"Flimsy, fragile phone.","I had this phone for one day before the screen blew up..hadn't even made a call! My problems started when I installed the battery; I couldn't get the battery cover back on to save my life. After about 20 minutes I finally succeeded but it never really aligned properly with the bottom of the phone. I imagine if I'd kept the phone I would have been replacing the cover regularly.Then I couldn't get it activated. I tried on line and their web site crashed, then when I called for help the phone wouldn't take the commands their rep told me to put in. I had to take the battery out and start over twice!Finally I thought I had it, went to bed that night without using it and when I turned it on the next day the screen was corrupted with some kind of red ""splat!"" graphic. Nothing I did made it come back on and I could not get an answer from VM about what it could be. Finally I contacted Amazon and arranged a return which is now in progress. They promised me a full refund. We'll see ;)"
2,"Pretty face, but voice quality could be better.","I have been a satisfied Virgin Mobile (VM) customer for several years, happily using an Audiovox 8500. VM uses the SPRINT cellular network which has a strong signal in my area.Lets talk about the SLICE which is made by UTSTARCOM. I was very much attracted to this thin stylish cell phone. I am not going to waste any time - what you see is what you get. It is basically a pretty phone with very good reception, but the outgoing voice quality is below average. The person on the other end will think you are swallowing water while talking. Another issue is the cramped key pad.This cell phone reminds me of a pretty girl with the voice of cartoon character. If you prize fashion over function - go for it.I am switching back to my AUDIOVOX.P.S. You will feel compelled to purchase additional ""wallpaper"" for an additional $2, because what comes on the phone as standard fare is ugly!"
4,Gripping little mystery,"Place a mystery in front of a young girl, especially when it is having such a profound effect on her little brother, whom she loves and protects, and she will see it as a challenge.So it is for Jill, when she and Jack are foisted, without explanation, on they country-dwelling aunt and uncle. To complicate matters further, Jack has been struck dumb by some event in his past, which has to be part of the mystery.Jill soon befriends a boy from the neighbouring farm, Dan, who endears her with his kindness and understanding towards Jack. They have some adventures together, and Jack begins to enjoy life in the countryside.Dan and Jill search for clues together, and make a little progress.Eventually, the mystery begins to unravel its horrific roots.I can't tell you any more for fear of spoiling the story for you, but I can promise you a very gripping quick read if you select this book."
5,A decent quick reference text for the library,We bought this at a recommendation of an instructor in a university extension course for Clinical Trials Certification.It is a good low cost reference book with useful information. A worthwhile book for the library.
5,Creedence Strikes Again!,"With WILLY AND THE POORBOYS,Creedence Clearwater Revival takes us down to a corner on any old street in a southern town to hear a band of four kids play jugband music for nickles and dimes.If you close your eyes and let the music take you, Wily and his Poorboys could be a real band(epecially on the tracks COTTON FIELDS,POORBOY SHUFFLE,DOWN ON THE CORNER,SIDE O'THE ROAD and THE MIDNIGHT SPECIAL).John Fogerty's lyrics have a sharper edge than usual(witness IT CAME OUT OF THE SKY,DON'T LOOK NOW[IT AIN'T YOU OR ME], EFFIGY and FORTUNATE SON).Of course the CCR blues rock roots still shine through(FEELIN'BLUE).The great thing about Creedence was that they experimented freely with their sound while still retaining the musical elements that made them America's top singles band.Once more the band sounded like a finely tuned musical machine;all seperate parts working together as a whole.Even better was to come with their next release;but that's another review."
2,A gimmick SACD,A hybrid stereo SACD. I bought these SACD thinking to experience to listen CCR in multichannel sound. It's a stereo recording on a SACD. A true gimmick!!!
5,Creedence can do no wrong,"Yet another great album from Creedence Clearwater Revival. Sure, everybody knows the two hits Down On The Corner, and Fortunate Son. But the rest of the album is great too. Other highlights include Feelin' Blue, The Midnight Special and Side O' The Road. Creedence fans must own this one.Also recommended: Bayou Country, Green River and Cosmo's Factory."
5,Wow,When I first listened to this album a few years ago I thought this was a greatest hits album. I can't believe how good every song is. Wow!
1,AAAGH,I just finished watching this and......it's all true....I didn't believe it but....it's all true........oh god......stupid stupid stupid of me.......my brain is melting....I....I......lhglsrknjvg.jdz;m/fh bmlnj
5,Best Worst Movie of all time?,"From [...]:gTroll 2 is the perfect storm of crappy filmmaking, a confluence of lack of talent, a rushed production (with an Italian crew that speaks no English, and an American cast who speaks no Italian), and miserable effects that produced one of the best worst movies of all time."
1,My # 1 Worst Movie Of All-Time,This movie top the list of all the worst films I've ever seen. I can't believe I have to give this movie higher than a star. UGH... I rather kiss a dog on the b*** than watch this stink-a-roo again.
2,Slow and steady wins the race,"A little boy has trouble convincing his family that the town they are vacationing in (as part of a weird family exchange program) is enhabited not by normal human beings but a convent of cannibalistic vegan trolls. If the fact that their town is an anagram for GOBLIN isn't enough to convince this family that something's up, than may they all gain artificial intellegence. Though this is a pretty sick and lame sequel, the plot is good and the details are interesting enough to keep you glued to the edge of your seat, where this movie puts you and keeps you til the final frame. Really should have been talored for R rating."
1,The poorest attempt at filmmaking ever...anywhere.,"No matter how hard I try, I would never be able to make a movie this bad. Every aspect of this movie is worth laughing out loud at. I thought I was the only person in the world who had discovered this travesty and when I showed it to my friends, they were in complete disbelief. I mean, the troll people - they give unknowing victims green food to turn them into trees and goblin food. Piss poor acting, $20 costumes, and elementary school level story line make this movie a must see for anyone who can tell the difference between a good movie and a bag of sh*t. This movie makes you feel better about yourself because you know you'd never make an abortion such as this. If anybody out there thinks this movie is actually good in any way other than how bad it is, let me know so I can make fun of you."
1,THE WORST! 15 minutes felt like an HOUR!,"I gave this movie a 1 star rating~ it deserves a negative 10! I watched the movie and could not believe the awful acting constuming PLOT! It isn't EVEN ABOUT TROLLS! It's about Goblins~ complete waste of time! I watched 15 minutes of this mess and it felt like I had watched AT LEAST 1 hour! What a MESS! It doesn't deserve the high ratings it has~must be from the ""filmmakers""."
1,WORST MOVIE ON EARTH!!!!,THIS MOVIE IS LOWER THAN LOW BUDGET. IT TOTALLY SUCKED. THE CAST WAS AWFUL. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS MESSED UP MOVIE!!!!!
1,Troll 2? Whoop De Doo.,"This movie is bad.The title suggests it is a sequel or potential sequel to ""Troll"", not that good a movie to begin with, but it was not. It had nothing to do with Troll.Its special effects are a joke, you can see how fake the creature costumes are.The only good movies like these do is that they let B and C grade actors get pocket change to feed their faces with McDonald's french fries!!!!"
5,"Funnier than that time I ""ate"" curdled ""milk""","Ladies and gentlemen, if you need to waste about an hour and a half and you've already tried ""bad"" bad movies then I suggest you get a hold of this gem of the ""z"" movie generation. Only once did I laugh myself into an asthma attack before I saw Troll 2, however watching this film I used up the entire enhaler. You cannot waste your time with a movie that's as funny as this one and not wonder why there aren't more like it. Ed Wood Jr. would have been proud. It makes me proud to be an American, when I see movies like this are being made in our fair country. God bless us, every one of us. No Diggity, no doubt."
2,Deranged trainwreck of a movie,A deranged trainwreck of a movie but with the same sort of sincere naivete that gives the films of Ed Wood their enduring appeal.
5,Mr. Franklin is right!,"This movie will blow your mind. Maybe not the first time, but stick with it and you'll see."
5,Drink your broth!,"""Stop the car, Dad!""""Do you have to throw up?""""Yes! I have to throw up!""ahh! I would have to say that this movie changed my life and the life of many others... I have introduced this movie to many friends.... bringing us nights of pure Nilbog joy!Sadly, my copy of Troll 2 has taken a beating from too much viewing! FOR THE LOVE OF GOD! Please release Troll 2 on DVD!and to those who haven't seen this movie... you're missing one of the greatest films of all times... my dream would be to see this in the theater....and to the fellow fan who intends on making a Troll III... well we had the same idea! lol! well keep working on it! we will too!"
3,Great starter printer!,"""Starter"" is the key word here. The cost is quite affordable; set-up is easy. For a printer of this size, don't expect to put in half reams of paper (logical). The ink cartridge cost is also affordable...BUT HERE IS THE REASON WHY: the cartridges hold next to nothing! If you're printing off a paper with more than 50 pages, get ready to change your cartridge! You will pay for this printer in ink cartridges in under 30 days. And like other reviews...it is SLOW. If color is not an issue, but you want speed and a better balance of ink used, upgrade to the HP 1020 (NOT the 1012-no, no, no, no, no!!)."
1,HP is trying to steal from you !!,"DON'T BUY THIS PRINTER !!The ink cartridges hold only 5 ml of ink and cost around $15. That means that it's gonna cost you $15 for only 135 pages !! If you print out a book with 260 pages its gonna cost you $30 !! You'll go broke using this printer.The low price is just a hook, do not be fooled as I was. HP is a bad company with no respect for its costumers."
1,WATCH OUT,"Do not be caught with Marketing failures, This printer ships with a color ink cartridge only. The Black and white cartridge is optional.... Wake up HP Are you going to Nickel and Dime your way out of the printer market.??"
3,The Bic Lighter of printers,"A good disposable model; note that it is only shipped with color cartridge; b&w is optional, and necessary for economical use. Cartridges cheaper than some, if you decide to refill."
5,great inexpensive printer,"I love this printer. Simple to use and great for the price. Cartridge doesn't last more than 2 months if you do a lot of printing, but inexpensive to replace and easy to find."
2,Small but deadly.,"Being a graduate student and living in an apartment, I was hoping to find a cheap printer that would allow me to print off course materials and assignments. It prints off things quite well and it is fast. It does not, however, print 500 pages per month. 50-100 pages per month is a more reasonable estimate and then the cartridges cost over $20, which is high considering how often you need to buy them.The item did arrive in a timely fashion and it arrived in the specified condition."
1,Faulty wiring,"I detest this printer. I've bought quite a few printers in my day: Lexmark, Canon, and have been quite happy with most HP's, but this was the pits. The first one I brought home worked fine the first time but when I tried to turn it on the next day, it wouldn't cut on. It just died on me. I unplugged it, plugged it back it...then it worked for a little while before dying again. This time for good. I returned it, got another one...same problem. Except this time it keeps going. All I have to do is unplug it before each and every time I turn it on. Nice, huh?Now I'm browsing online again and I've learned my lesson for sure. No more el cheapo models. I'm at least going to shell out for a midline price with some heft to it that will last me a year or two."
2,Outdated,"There are more up to date and better-written accounts of the KGB. At the time this probably was a good book, but time and the fall of the iron curtain has provided a flood a details. This work is interesting for the die-hard reader who will want to compare the work with others of its time. The book is well laid out and has a workman like style of writing."
1,not what was expected,"Not at all what was expected. Preview shown was inaccurate at best. Definitely not a 'bouquet"" book as it says."
3,"Beautifully illustrated book, but short on information.",This book is at best a coffee table book. I didn't realize when I purchased this book that it is a mere flower pictorial and does not lend itself to teaching anything really about flowers or how to arrange. But I give this book props for it's beauty and picture layout.
1,Rather disappointed,"I had hoped this book would be a large presentation of Christian's work - but it is a few large unfocused pictures with lots of text. I think it was not worth the hype. Thank goodness I did not pay full price for this book as it now sits on my coffee table with other ""regrettable purchases""."
3,O Snap Kit Cathedral,"This church/cathedral is very nice looking and adds a nice touch to my grandson's O guage train set. However, it really needs to be glued together to not fall apart."
4,Great product,"I have owned an A.T. Cross set since 1966 and it has served wonderfully. I had a small problem with the old style pencil works a couple decades ago, but Cross honored their lifetime warranty and replaced the thick-lead innards with the new style 0.5 mm works. BTW, Amazon incorrectly says the pencil uses .05 mm leads; it actually uses 0.5 mm.I would have awarded a perfect 5 stars except that A.T. Cross has sent their manufacturing (at least part of it) to China. This icon of American quality should stay here. I for one would have paid more for the set. When I buy Cross, it is for special gifts and the ""Made in China"" label diminishes the image of the gift regardless of whether or not the quality and guarantee are as good as ever."
5,Timeless classic,"Both the pen and the pencil are well designed, functional, and surprisingly durable. The two Waterman pens I had developed cracks and showed their cheap construction but the Cross barely shows any wear. I received the 10K Gold filled Cross set over 20 years ago and it still works and looks fantastic. Still brings unexpected compliments from business associates."
1,Don't buy this,"I had a Cross pen & pencil set back in the day, so I remember the quality from the past. I was excited to receive my new set, but not anymore. I'm returning this idem for refund. This pen & pencil set is not worth the money. This is a cheap replica of what Cross use to be. Must be made in China, need I say more? I give it one star for good shipping only."
3,"You're just paying for the outer shell,","Aside from being gold, this is a pretty basic set of writing utensils. The pen writes with the same dexterity as a typical BIC pen you buy in bulk. The mechanical pencil isn't too bad-- you don't have to push too hard and the lead, so far for me, never snaps mid-letter; but the eraser I could do without. Not only is it tiny, but it leaves streaks and doesn't erase all the way. Ever. Basically, these pens earned a spot on the side table where they might get used if I decided to play Sudoku, or something."
1,Bad pen,"The pen arrived in poor condition, there is a gap that opens between the spinning cap and the pen. I have another set (exactly the same model and everything) and it doesn't have that problem."
1,Bad Experience,"Received this expensive set on January 18. Signed my name a few times and now the ball point will not stay out to where I can write; as if a spring is broke. So, as of February 4 my pen and yet another $10.00, plus insurance expense are enroute to Lincoln RI for repairs."
4,unbeatable,my grandpa had this pen set for 50 years and i can tell you this...it never broke and he said it was one of the best material possesions he had ever owned
1,Warning,"I returned mine. The pump stopped working properly after 30 minutes with an indication that the hose had a crimp in it. This was not the case, and after 10 more tries I gave up. Be sure you can return your unit before you buy if you encounter the same problem."
2,Worked great for about a year,Worked great for a year then stopped working altogether. I still makes some noise but the compressor never kicks in. I bought a Kenmore and it is working ok now. Bought the two at the same time after I finished the basement. The Kenmore is still going.
2,Short Lived,"Worked very well for almost two years. At that point, pump stopped functioning completely. I did expect more for my investment."
4,"Loose Ends, Exciting and Suspencefull","Mr Cox has rendered an exciting suspencefull situation that keeps you hooked until the end. I love the Liz character and enjoyed it that she had such a central roll in this book. The fact that Alex was still around and the T personality was not was refreshing, it gave me the wonderful season 1 group that worked out things together with mentions of season 2 happenings. Mr Cox made reference to the story line of the WB show Roswell quite successfully, with the only exception being that Liz and Max are a couple in the book.I hope you all enjoy reading this book as much as I did and that Mr Cox writes many more stories for us to enjoy."
1,"A book about a show about a book, no thanks","This book is very disapointing. That is, if you've read the Roswell High series and keep up with the show, like me.Having just finished #10 in Roswell High, I was disoriented in the caracter descriptions, both physicaly (in the RH series, Alex has red hair, for example) and psychologically. The way the caracters act and think correspond neither to the show or the original books. It's like if someone else was in their skin and it just doesn't feel right.On top of that, I find the plot ridiculous, stupid and far-fetched. As if the author HAD to write a book and had no idea what about (no offence Greg).It took me forever to finish reading it because I just couldn't get into it. This isn't very promising for the other books in this collection... Do yourselves a favor and treasure Melinda Metz's Roswell High books, she does, by far, a better job when it comes to develloping emotions and actions of our favorite out-of-this-world gang."
1,Published Fanfic,"I am a huge Roswell fan, so I was eager to read the new novel. Greg Cox has written many excellent Star Trek books, so I was excited to see what he would do with Roswell. Loose Ends, however, was not up to par and I came away disgusted. The story was so bad it left me in fits of laughter, and the author seemed to have no concept of the show. The trip to Carlsbad takes place during the summer of 2001, but Alex is still living. At the same time, Tess is gone. Cox must have known something of the writer's plans for late season two, but chose not to incorporate all of them.This novel is fanfiction you have to purchase, nothing more. I'd suggest visiting one of the multitudes of Roswell websites to find higher-quality stories for free."
3,Not the worst book I've ever read,"I liked this book. Granted, it was no earth shattering moment in my life. I mean how many times can you call someone trigger-happy? And this just might be me but I thought the aliens put Tabasco on stuff, as opposed to drinking it from the bottle. One part I found confusing was when Max turned his hair red and then later it said that Liz barely recognized him and his blonde look, or something to that effect. Well aside from those points I thought it was good. I'm a huge Roswell fan myself and I can't wait for the next book. (Up w/ UPN, Down w/ WB!)"
3,Love Roswell - hate the writing in this book!,"I LOVE THE SHOW - CAN'T SAY IT ENOUGH!! So, I went out and bought myself this book - boy was I disappointed! I've seen better amature fan fiction written about Roswell than Cox was able to do with this! The writing was way too descriptive (how many ways can you say Isabel looks like a cover-girl model?), and he had the characters say and do things they never would - HELLO!! They don't drink Tabasco sauce! They put it ON things! Just seems that Cox didn't know anything about the characters or the story line behind the show prior to writing the book. Knowing the characters' names is not enough - especially with such a special story as Roswell! Hey - at least this will tide me over till Season 3 starts - but just barely! I think I'd rather watch re-runs of the show (or get a root-canal) rather than re-read this book!"
5,a must read for all roswell fans,this book was fabulous. it finds the gang going on a much needed vacation to carsbad caves to get away from everything and unwind. while in the gift shop liz spots the guy who shot her 2 years ago and unfornately he also recognizes her. this automatically puts her into high stress mode and max into a man on a mission to stop the gunman at all cost. lukily cooler heads prevail and they investigate the guy and find out he is into top secret work with the air force. they also find out that the gunman will go to any cost to keep his secret and will brook no betrayal. this book is great because the tv show never did do anything about the gunman and his whereabouts. i think this should be made into a 2 part roswell show because it follows the storyline of the tv show beautifully. for all roswell fans this is a must!!!!!!!!
4,Great book,"This was a great book about roswell but it didn't focus on the more minor characters, such as Kyle or Valenti. It was really well written and you got to find out a lot more about the physcopath that accidentally shot Liz in the Crashdown. It constantly kept me on the edge of my seat and I never wanted to put it down."
4,fun,this game is so much fun. I bought it a year ago and still play it. I really think this game is for all age's and even if you know nothing about soccer it helps you out in learning some stuff about soccer. i weoulsd reccomand getting a memory disk cause you cant save your coach with out it. Thids gamwe hasd lots of stuff to do like arrainging your oder of the team and a team name and normal stuff like that. All around this is a fun game.
2,Big disappointment,"This video is too much basic and boring. There are only four or five steps in this video and the steps are very basic and not funny. There are a lot of better videos than this, so if you don't wanna waste your money don't buy this video."
4,Nice Book On Labrador Retreivers!,"This is an inexpensive but quite accessible book about training Labs, a no nonsense nuts and bolts primer for the new caretaker of a the best dog breed yet devised by the Heavens; the Labrador Retriever. As someone who shares his house and life with four of God's single most nearly perfect craeature, I can testify as to the accuracy and relevance of all the information in this wonderful compendium. It is a literal treasure trive of data about how to raise and care for your new best friend, and it covers everything from potty training to kennel care.As a personal note, it is improtant to remember how sensitive Labs are, that one never ever strikes one, and that gently scolding them will get you the reaction you want much more efficiently than would any unjustified corporal punishment. Just remember, friends, there are really no bad dogs; only ignorant and incompetent people trying in vain to train the dogs. What you need to avoid such pitfalls is all here! Enjoy!"
3,"Okay book, but not a lot of new information","I have got this book along with another yellow lab training book. This is the one I finished first. I am not that amazed of the quality of the content. Of course, you should love your puppy and treat him/her with properly. If not, why would you get one? It has a bunch of ""do's"" and ""don'ts"" which may or may help you. I have got some ideas, but me and my puppy also attended a local ""puppy kindergarden"" which I found fun and beneficial for both of us. My puppy is over 14 wks now, and he sure is growing and handful.If you are going to get this book, check out the content. How would you do it? You may have to buy it. But it is okay. It is a decent book overall.Have fun raising yours. We are having fun!"
4,Great Beginner Video (Salsa on 1),"Explains and demonstrates the basics very well. I especially like the approach to teaching turns and combinations. They don't teach set combinations. They give you basic turn components and show you how to combine them, do variations and how to flow from one move to another. This allows the beginner to create the combinations he feels comfortable with and keep adding moves on his own as he progresses.I must disagree with another reviewers' description of this style as 'New York on 2'. This is a Salsa 'On 1' description of the steps. Ron clearly describes the basic stepping on the 1-2-3, 5-6-7 and breaking (stepping forward) on the 1.'New York Style on 2' Steps are on the 1-2-3, 5-6-7 also, but breaks on the 2.If you are a beginner and are confused by this, I can tell you the style presented here is very widely used, the easiest to learn and a good starting point for other styles."
4,Excellent dancers and teachers!!,"I bought the beginner, intermediate and advanced videos from these series. The three videos follow the same format, they first show the moves dancing together, then they break down the steps showing both the man and the female steps and to finalize they dance together again.Both dancers give advice on how to add a little style to your dancing and their instruction is definetely among the best. In fact, I took a basic salsa class and felt frustrated with the results but this video is so clear that even learning without a partner is possible.The only reason for giving it four stars is that I feel that they could have taught more moves if they had spent less time explaining the moves over and over."
2,few steps and not so latin.,this is one dance video where ron and bethana did not make the grade. there were just a few dance steps included here that are too basic and does not havethat latin flavor that you find in josie neglia's dance videos. i would recommend instead josie neglia's salsa levels 1 and 2 and levels 3 and 4 which showsmore fantastic dance routine that has that latin touch which you see in latin clubs.
5,"Big, Strong and Sturdy","The title says it all for this review. Great for big projects, workshop use and heavy clean up."
2,flimsy,"I ordered this for my son for Christmas since it was on his wishlist. We were very disappointed with the quality--it is flimsy, just not very strong feeling. His dad has one that is much more sturdy and I ended up getting him one like it for about the same price. There are much better dust pans to be found."
3,Still Waiting for this book,"I have not yet receive this book. Please, I would like to know what is happening. I need this book as soon as possible. After I get the book I will make the review. Thanks! Wendy"
3,Plaything,"Most of the tracks have aged well, with a few exceptions. The only sizable hit was ""Plaything"", and since its not available to download, buying this CD is your best option for adding it to your iPod.The title track is good, but there's a remix out there on vinyl with a rap by Melle Mel that is way better."
1,Unbelievable.,"unbelievable. and not in a good way. i'm muslim, so i know mainly what its like. but i was completely shocked at how they portrayed everything. dancing ang swimmin in front of guys. showing her hair only because he was upset .. it felt wrong. there are muslims who aren't scarved, like sabah, so why couldnt they make the character like that. by scarving her, they made it worse when they made her show her body nd hair. some of the acting was good, and i watched it twice, but it doesnt mean i dont have comments. im sorry i am commenting badly, but its what i genuinly feel. i felt it was a complete crock at muslims, and gave us a vry bad name."
5,The Road to Santiago is a magnificent chapter among many cuban stories,"Having been touched by a previous story by Mr. Figueredo, I recently added this one to my collection.This story underlines the challenges that a lot of cuban children experienced during and after the cuban revolution. Politics aside, it emphasizes world experiences through a child's eyes.For children, all that is experienced is an adventure. It wasn't until I became an adult that I realized the elements of danger that I went through growing up in a country going through political turmoil.Great story, beautifully illustrated by Pablo Torrecilla. The illustrations reminded me so much of the memories I have of my land of birth. Don't miss sharing this information with your children."
4,Super lego train set will keep your children busy,My son received this for his birthday yesterday and he was so happy! Assembly took much of the rest of the day and he was still finishing it up this morning. He is seven now and needed his dad's help to build this. The train moves nicely on the track and has a remote control with a diesel horn. He already has the Amtrak lego train and saw this one advertised on that box. He has been asking for it for months. It is not being sold by Lego anymore in the U.S. so it is hard to find. Worth seeking it out though!
4,Christian Marriage,If you believe in the authenticity of the Bible this book on marriage is for you.
3,Good for the Money,Good camera for the dollar. Sharp pictures but the color view screen is useless in daylight.
5,Jeff Gordon,This is a beautiful book for fans of NASCAR and esp. fans of Jeff Gordon. It is well written and the photography is very outstanding. It would be a great addition to any library.
4,A Book That Exhibits Teen Creativity In It's Truest Form,"Personally, I enjoyed the more emotional and eye-opening pieces like ""Kody"", the story of a young man who struggles to cope with the loss of his best friend after he commits suicide, and ""Hollow"", a very well-written and interesting piece about a priest who must carry not only his own life's burden, but also those of the people who confide in him. And for readers who prefer fiction full of creativity and fun, there are stories like ""Dragons"" and ""Shadows Of The Past"". This book is filled with well-written poems, interesting artwork and photographs, and stories that are good entertainment as well as those with serious morals. A great read for teens and adults alike."
2,"They look cute, but OUCH!","I thought these were adorable when I saw them online, but once I started wearing them I could barely keep them on even while sitting at a desk all day. This is one of the most uncomfortable pairs of shoes I have ever worn. They ARE cute though, so if you can stand the pain go for it."
4,"Very useful, but a couple of flaws...","This is the first time I had to use the backpack because I am going off to college now and I need an easy way to take it. I have been able to securely put the gamecube in the backpack and I know that there is a place for the games, but I don't see a space for the controllers. There is only enough space for one controller unless you want to throw the controllers in the bag with the gamecube. Other than that I would like to know what that small compartment on the outside is for. It doesn't deserve 5 stars, but 4 stars might be a bit low because it is amazing except that there isn't enough space for controllers."
2,Don't put all your eggs in one basket.,"The bag isn't worth it, unless you plan on doing alot of travel with your Gamecube. The padding is makes the bag too bulky for any other practical use. You also have to be extra careful with the bag, just think of the contents that are in there!! Your games, your controllers, your GAMECUBE and your GBA if you have one!"
4,This is a nice one,"While the CD as a whole is pretty good, ""Hotel 49"" makes this CD shine, and I'd get it for this song alone. It's a hard, swinging song very unlike the songs he's trademarked for. He actually proves that he can play the trumpet. He teamed up with one of Miles' guys on this album as well, so you may hear some similarites (which isn't a bad thing). I also recommend ""Chet."" It's very mellow."
5,great looking jacket/great price,my son was searching all over for a varsity jacket. a lot of the ones we saw were only made of cotton or fleece like in a hoodie. this is wool with real leather sleeves and has a warm lining. the quality is excellent. the navy with the cream sleeves makes it look like a retro jacket. my son is very pleased. and the price was half of what some of the others that i saw so i am doubly pleased.
3,burns batteries but best of the lot for the price,"I had a RainMatic and it was great for my homes on LI and in AZ and CA. Unfortunately they went out of business.I searched garden centers and the web and settled on this unit. The one thing I miss is the rain sensor which prohibits it from turning on when the ground is wet (beyond just damp). The only one that had that feature was Gardenia, but this Melnor was the only unit that had an odd/even day feature. We have water restrictions in two of my homes which makes this unit ideal."
1,junk - dead on arrival - valves leak on either position,Garbage - 2 of the 4 valves let water flow on any position - I am returning this things right away - I did not think to read these review beforehand... bummer.
1,Broke before I even used it,"I purchased from someplace else however, it looks great on paper. when i brought it home and started to set it up the plastic mount to attach to a the spigot popped off. It was useless as soon as any water pressure was applied ... simply just fell apart. I have since returned and have ordered an Orbit off Amazon."
1,Look elsewhere,"Features are great (thus the one star) but of the three I purchased two years ago, two died within the first year and the third is not working well now. Water gets into the electronics and shorts out the circuits. Plus one of them would not turn off the water completely. Strongly suggest you try a different manufacturer."
1,Perfect if you like being surprised by giant water bills,"I set up my Vigro water timer to water for 16 minutes every two days and left for 11 days in August. The worthless gaget ended up watering for 16 hours every two days so I returned to find my garden had turned into a swamp, and a GIANT water bill awaited me."
2,aqua timer okay,"The timers came quickly and were easy to set up. the problem was that after using one of them for one week, the manual handle FELL off the side of the time and water came gushing out. I have asked the supplier if they have a suggested fix or replacement and have not heard back from them at all! At least if I had bought this at a store nearby, I could have taken it to them and they would have replaced it."
1,Avoid this one for sure...,"Programming went fine but as soon as it was on the faucet with the water on, the timed outlet started leaking and then the inlet connection blew completely off. I only have about 60psi at my house, but the input piece is simply pressed into the housing so I doubt it would hold even 20psi of pressure - much less the 100+ it's supposed to be rated for. Luckily I had purchased it locally because I returned it less than 2 hrs later. It was so bad I didn't even want to try another one and risk flooding the crawl space (not to mention the water bill). I hope some of their other models are better constructed, but honestly I don't even know that I would try one after that. Unless you want to lose sleep worrying about it, don't get this model. Sorry Amazon, no reflection on your company."
3,Melnor backtracks,"The previous version of this product was much more versatile and useful. They altered it. The reason escapes me.The previous version could be programmed to water six times a day, at any time, for as long as you wished. Also it had pre-programmed schedules, and it provided for 5 different sets of watering times.Try to do this on their new version. Failure. You still can program up to six times a day, but not whenever you choose. Rather, the hours of the day are divided by the number of times you wish to water, and that's what you have to settle for. You cannot, for example, program to water at 8:00 am, then again at 10:00 am, and again at 10:20. If you want to water 3 times a day, it would have to be at 8 hour intervals. Bummer.Melnor, if it ain't broke, don't fix it. Remember that saying?"
2,NOT USER FRIENDLY,"This product does not live up to its potential. It is extremely difficult to program and if you make a mistake doing so you have to begin from the beginning. I wanted to program the timer so that it would water for two hours on Monday, Wednesday and Friday at 5 a.m. and on every day of the week to provide a mist from 4 p.m. to 5 p.m. I could never figure out how to set the timer to do so. The best that I have been able to do is set it to water for two hours every other day starting at 5 a.m. and on the same day to provide a mist for an hour beginning at 4 p.m. I am very disappointed."
1,Shame on you,"Had Melnor for many years and satisfied. ordered , trusting, recieved, installed, programed, hooked up, turned on....Bam!!Should have read the reviews. Output blows out of the unit.Been noted in reviews, RED FLAG. Melnor sleeping and not fixing.Returned to Amazon (great support). Ordered in the frustrated interim Orbit 62001 timer. Works great! easy portable programing unit. Tested for over one month with 4 programs and manual start idiot proof.Highly recommend and scrub Melnor.RPW"
3,Not A Great Propogation Timer Afterall,"I had a heck of a time getting this to work. I bought it to run my misting system for propogation. I liked that the timer stayed dry while water was being sprayed all over it by my misting system. It didnt mess up the display and get inside of the timer as it did with a timer i got at lowes. However if buying a timer for propogation, I would recommend one made for that task. One that is wired, not a battery model, specially this one. I would recommend this for outside propogation like in sand but not in a greenhouse. A greenhouse needs a timer misting 3 times a minute for 6-10 seconds each."
2,Only One Valve is Programmable.,This has only one programmable valve. The second valve is manual on/off. I don't know why they make it so complicated. You can always use a cheap Y-hose adapter for that.
1,Worked for 1 year,"Was a good product for the one season it worked. Even though I stored it in my garage for the winter, i hooked it up this year and it does not work properly. The time valve gets stuck and does not open during timed watering or using manual.Probably worth spending a little more up front on a better device"
1,NOT A TWO HOSE TIMER - ONLY ONE,"This product professes to be an ""electronic aqua timer duo"", but is actually a single electronic outlet with a splitter for a non-controlled outlet. IT IS NOT A TWO HOSE TIMER>>>> Am returning it"
1,Bad Investment,"This is the worse timer I ever bought. After couple of months of use, the inlet snapped out and I couldn't make it work again. I couldn't replace this timer because I lost the receipt. I will buy different one. Please don't buy this timer you only waste your money."
1,Didn't handle California sun,"I received this unit as a replacement for the unit that I actually ordered. Probably should have sent it back immediately as it turns out. It apppeared to be a slight upgrade from the unit I paid for. THis one worked great for 45 days and then the display went out. I replaced the battery and reprogrammed it. As soon as I turned on the water the display went out. It must be an internal leak of some type. Anyway, I will not purchase this model again."
2,Inlet Pops Off...,"The timer part of this water timer works great, its just that the female hose inlet is a press fit and your garden hose will likely pop off of the timer when you turn the water on."
1,These failed within 18 months,"I purchased two Melnor Electronic Water Timer #3060. Both failed within the first 18 months. I have used Melnor in the past and was happy with the products. Electronics are great, unless the fail prematurely. This model is a piece of junk."
4,excellent for price,"bought mine for $16. Unlike other reviewers, have found 1 set of baatteries sufficient for at least 1 year. Plastic hose connectors are the weakest link, but, has been excellent for flower beds for the last two years, thus far. (Have permanent system for entire yard, but not the front foundation beddings.) I use this mostly for the annual flower beds with drip and/or soakers."
2,Can't trace lost shipment.,"I have never seen the Melnor 3060 timer. The accessory for it, a moisture sensor, arrived two weeks ago, but the Melnor timer it connects to has not arrived. Three times I have been unsuccessful in using the tracking number to find out anything other than ""shipped"". The message ""invalid tracking number"" always displays. Supposedly my timer was shipped June 22. Today is July 23. Meanwhile, I have had to pay for it on my credit card."
1,Be Prepared to Burn Batteries,"This sprinker timer is lousy! It sucks so much juice from the batteries that they go dead in less than a month, and that's with a conservative watering schedule of about every 3 days.If you had to run this thing daily, you'd spend more for batteries in the first 6 months than the whole unit costs!I've used Gardena in the past and they're much higher quality -- though you should take care of the ""O"" rings."
2,Uses batteries like they're going out of style,"This works, but it uses up batteries like crazy. With a modest setting (1 watering per day) I was changing batteries every 2-3 weeks.I switched to the Orbit Sunmate 62001 which has been running great on the first set (uses 2) of 9v batteries for almost TWO YEARS."
1,worthless and useless,"This item arrived appearing to be in perfect condition, only problem it didn't work. Tried three different batteries and nada. I had a similar one a couple of years ago and it suddenly died after about a year - I didn't remember when I bought this on or never would."
1,Sorry I bought it,"I am sorry to say this product is an absolute disappointment. The computer engineering is likely fine, but the construction is JUNK. When I installed the battery, I found that one of the 2 screw receiving holes was stripped. I then connected the device to the water source, and when I turned on the water, the device was blown off by the water pressure because the input line (black threaded receiver that screws onto the faucet) was apparently NEVER GLUED IN PLACE at the factory. So I've waited for days to set this up just prior to leaving on a trip and am now stuck. POOR QUALITY. Shame on the manufacturer."
5,Works very well as prior Melnor products have always done,"This new model Melnor sprinkler timer works very well, just as previous ones I have owned. I was also very pleased with the prompt delivery service from Amazon. Job well done by Melnor and Amazon!!"
1,NOTE: NOT a Dual timer at all!,"The packaging on this timer is a little confusing in that it appears to be a dual timer, but in reality it is a single timer with a manual outlet.NOT A DUAL TIMER AT ALL!"
1,Melnor timer failures,Melnor 6-Cycle Electronic Aqua Timer #3015I have purchased two of these in the last 2 years and both have failed with internal water leaks. The first failed in less than 5 months and I just figured I had a bad one. The second failed in 7 months and I now know the product is inferior. An internal leak fills the battery compartment with water and shorts out the battery and subsequently the timer quits working. I do not recommend this product.
1,Worked great for 14 days - then it pulled apart,"Like a number of other customers I, too, was pleased with this product - until it broke. I was moving the hose when it pulled the timer right off the hose bib. Yes, the instructions say be careful and I was."
1,Defective Product - DO NOT BUY,"This is a poorly constructed design. Within two seconds of turning the hose on, the connection began to leak, then when normal pressure built up, the connection to the spigot shot off and water went everywhere. I quickly tried pushing the unit back on and when I did, the whole thing became filled with water and shorted out.I figured it was just a broken unit someone put on the shelf, so I returned it to Home Depot for a replacement. Same thing happened to the next one. What a shame, a simple component as the spigot connection, seems as though the product was designed without glue and they figured a snap on connection would suffice.DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. I'm thrilled it failed with in seconds and not when I was away on vacation for a week. Imagine your hose running on full blast for a week because the connection fell off. All that water and the damage it could have caused."
1,"Works great initially, then dies","Initially I was very impressed by this timer. 6 cycles, easy to program. However after just a year of use, the timer died. I replaced the batteries and tried fixing it to no avail. Would not recommend because of reliability."
1,Eats Batteries like No Tomorrow,You literally will have to spend a fortune in batteries and each time you lose your program. This product is awful.
1,Short life span,"Set this unit up for a drip system. It operated 10 minutes twice/day for two weeks then failed. It will not shut off. Didn't even outlast the battery. This unit is great in theory. I really like the ability to customize [the multiple watering start times and duration] down to the minute. Sadly, their quality is lacking."
3,An ok book,"I guess I'm in the minority here, but I have to give my opinion. This book was enjoyable, but I just didn't care about the characters. I think it could have been better. I liked Maggie ok, but thought her character could have been better developed. In the end, I really didn't care what happened. The relationship between her father and his family was underdeveloped also. I never quite understood why so much animosity existed with Ms. Rumsen and the family. I thought that needed to be explained more. I liked Ann Darby's style though, and I look forward to reading more."
3,Too slow,"I wanted to like this book, since the writers' ability to set the place and time were excellent, but the characters were not very likeable or interesting. You knew from the beginning that Maggie would get pregnant and that her boyfriend wouldn't marry her and her parents would go nuts. So, since nothing surprising happens, it really mattered that the characters would make you care, and they just didn't. I found myself wishing that the book would just end, and eventually, it did."
4,Very moving story!,"I started this book slowly, but at about midpoint in the novel I couldn't put it down.It is a story about one teenage girl and her family in 1965 California. The author captures the time excellently. It is also the story of a family and the trials and tribulations every family faces. I was quite surprised at some of the plot twists.I really liked this book and the only thing keeping me from giving it 5 stars is the fact I would have liked a more in depth character development of all the key players. It was an excellent read though and I would read another by Ann Darby."
5,Best strings for my guitar,"Of course, guitar strings of different materials and/or by different manufacturers do not sound the same on every guitar. In my experience each guitar ""wants"" a specific type/brand of string to maximize the guitar's tone. After much experimentation I have determined that the GHS Vintage Bronze strings bring out the best tone from my Guild D50. Other strings were too bright with no warmth. These strings are great for my guitar, which doesn't mean they'll be a perfect match for your instrument but try them to learn that for yourself."
3,"Good, but not Bloomsbury's best.","This novel reads like a short story that has been strung out to novel length, but should've stayed short. That's not to say it isn't an entertaining read: the premise is good and the beginning and end are intriguing. However, it does drag in the middle. A good, light, moderately humorous holiday novel."
3,Miss Hargreaves by Frankn Baker is a good read indeed!,"This was a good read -- definitely an interesting concept for a book and Frank Baker pulled it off very well. The protagonist of the novel (along with his best friend) make up a character named Miss Hargreaves and create her entire world to impress a gentleman that they meet while on holiday in England. When it turns out that Miss Hargreaves DOES actually exist, you can only imagine the shock and surprise on the part of the two main characters! Great story and very good writing style. I would recommend this book to just about anyone!"
2,disappointed,"While I love the concept of this item, as it encourages learning while in the bath...I'm disappointed by this particular item. The graphics printed on the front side of each letter and number visually distract from the overall shape making learning and recognition very difficult. If there were no graphics then the size, utility and concept of this item would be perfect. We're going to buy one of the other sets from another comany with no graphics."
3,Distractingly painted,"As with one of the other people who commented, the bubbles and dots on these letters make them very 'busy' and have made it very difficult to grasp the shape of the letters. My son is 22 months and already knows all his uppercase letters, so we bought these so he could learn his lowercase letters, but some of them, like the a painted purple with pink flowers is so busy that he has a hard time telling what it is and calls it an s whenever he sees it. If there are any other plain lowercase letters sets out there, I would recommend those.Also, they are pretty small so they have a hard time sticking to the bath wall like the bigger ones do and always fall off."
2,Smells,Fun toy but has a terrible odor that is offensive. Smells almost like formaldahyde other than that though they keep their shape nicely and are user friendly.
5,Nice Toy,"Heavy duty, non toxic foam letters and animals that float well. My granddaughter is enjoying it and will grow with it."
1,Won't let my kids play with them,"I was blown away by the petroleum smell from these. I washed them in the washing machine to get rid of the smell, but they still smell.I am going to try the Sassy brand."
1,Oscillating is unreliable therefor unit is usless,I bought this Melnor oscillating sprinkler together with the similar Melnor 360M 2 years ago and am now throwing both away as they both stop oscillating shortly after you set them up. It is very frustrating to start watering an area and then return to find that your sprinkler is stuck in one position and has failed at its intended job. I have 2 Gardena brand ocillating sprinklers (one is 12 years old) that work perfectly. Reliability counts so avoid these products.
1,NO stars,The second Melnor oscillating sprinkler I bought doesn't work any better than the first one. The sprinkler sticks (stops oscillating) at various times so you have to stay with it if you don't want a big puddle of water in one place. It may work for an hour or a few minutes but you never know how long before it sticks again.
1,Great at first!,"I bought two of these. They were really great adjustable sprinklers when first turned on. I loved them at first. But after just ONE WINTER sitting in the garage. ALL the rubber tips had shrunk, and the distance the water goes was LESS THAN HALF AS FAR!!!Seriously, this sprinkler Did cover an entire section of lawn the first year, but the second year, after rinsing it out, when the water pressure was high, and nothing else was on, it covered Less than half that same area.So I guess the message is... AVOID SPRINKLERS THAT SPRAY THE WATER THROUGH RUBBER TIPS!!!Oh yeah. And one of them quit oscillating, just like a lot of other people are saying!"
1,Not as good as the one it replaced,"I had the model before this. With it you could adjust independently the streams on the sides. With this model you adjust both sides at once. With the other one, as you shut down the streams, the length of the remaining streams increased. This doesn't do that.It is not as durable. I ordered this in April and this weekend I broke the tab off the adjustment lever. I am stuck with it wide open now."
5,doesn't get any better,"ever since I purchased my first Melnor 4200 several years ago I have, as they have broken, replaced my other ""much inferior"" sprinklers only with the Melnor 4200. Never have I seen such superior coverage and dependability in a sprinkler. It is completely quite. I have finally replaced all my other models with the Melnor 4200, and have complete control over my lawn watering needs. I even contacted the Melnor customer service when I needed filters where the hose attaches and received in the mail free filters. What more could you want, unless its rain!"
4,WORKS GREAT,"If you need a reliable sprinkler that is simple to adjust and dependable, get this. In fact, buy two, so you can water front and back at same time."
2,Oscillator not,"The features of this sprinkler were very attractive for an oddly shaped yard area like mine. Unfortunately I've just returned my second one because the oscillation stops and the sprinkler locks in one position. At first I thought it might be related to particular positional settings or volume of water, but it happened at a number of different orientations and volumes."
2,Received wrong item,I order melnor sprinkler model # 4200. What i received was model # 3900 which is a plastic version of the 4200. could have sent it back but did not want the hasel of returning it. the sprinkler works the same as the 4200 but i question it durablity.
2,Ok. I loved them until they quickly broke.,"I changed my mind. Personally, I prefer this sprinkler to others I have used. I have 2 Craftsman sprinklers that just did not hold up. I ordered 2 more of these because I like the fact that you can adjust the width of the area that you are watering. I recommend it. I have 12 different areas in my yard that I have to water when it doesn't rain so I am the watering queen. I will say that it wasn't particularly long lasting and it did tend to stick in one position after I used it for a while"
2,What a disappointment,"I rally thought this book had a great premise....healthcare conglomerations killing off the patients who used ""more than their share"" of resources. Okay....that wasn't it! So much of the book was just plain implausbible. I do not believe gang members talk that way. I don't see any real reason for the gang members to be in the story to start with! I think the coincidence of Jack and Therese meeting in the bar is unbelievable. I knew who the killer was about halfway into the book.I started reading Robin Cook in junior high...Coma and the rest. I think his last several books have been just churning them out, as simplistically as possible."
2,CORNY,"Robin Cook couldn't decide on which topic to write about. 1) Bash Managed Healthcare 2) NYC ghetto life, 3) contagions, 4) anything else that came to mind. So, he decided to write about all in one book, Contagions. The result, a story line that is ridiculous. When was the last time Cook played a game of basketball with the ""brothers"" in Harlem? Where was he going with that crap. What happened with the hospital in the end? What the hell were the roles of his superiors at the morgue. Did Cook run out of ""cool"" names like ""Flash"" and ""Twin for his Harlem gang that he had to make up other irrelevant characters? What happened to Chet? where did everybody go in the end? I know super whitey doc Jack and black gang leader Warren go out to dinner with their ""shorties"" at the end. GET REAL!!!!!!"
5,review,Robin Cook's Contagion is a medical thriller. It starts off with a mystery of how a patient died. This patient dies from a disease which no one knows what it is. A doctor than believes that it could be caused from a plague. When they found out that it came from a plague people begin to panic and try to find out where it came from.I would highly recommend this book to anyone that likes reading medical thrillers. It a really good book with some mystery and keeps you wanting to read more. I had no dislikes on this book.
2,Below par,"Most of the book is red herrings that go nowhere, preachy leaden exposition, implausible action sequences. And people bump into each other and clues while wandering around New York so often that it seems like the whole city must live on one block."
5,A Great Thriller...,"I love this book. This is one of the first books of Robin's that I read, and it was really well done! I really like his interesting twists. It keeps you in suspense until the very end, and allows the answer to go in many various directions, not specifically in one area, but allows you to keep guessing until the conclusionTo find out more about Jack Stapleton, and his daily adventures, read the book Contagion, by Robin Cook!:)"
4,I enjoyed it,This is another of Robin Cooks books that brings along Jack Stapelton. Such an involved character! As always the action never stops when Jack is involved.
1,"Lame plot, poorly written","It's obvious that the author is a doctor, not a writer. While the medical details are probably accurate (I wouldn't know), the prose is laughably bad. The plot drags (chapter after chapter setting up the medical situation), and then erupts into an unlikely series of narrow escapes. The mystery's solution comes out of left field. Not recommended."
3,Very Slow Beginning,"A very slow beginning, but it does get better as the pages turn. A very wicked twist at the end makes it interesting. This was an average Robin Cook book. The conspiracy was easy to figure out."
5,Fist time read but definatly not the last!,This was the first Cook book I have read and I loved it. I read the entire book in 24 hours. I literally did not put it down. I even had to pull out one of my old Microbiology text books to look up some of the medical terms. If all his books are like this one I should have them all read by the end of next week!
2,"Fast-paced, but kind of silly.","I just read Dr. Robin Cook's CONTAGION and I cannot adequately describe the depth of my frustration that his style earns him recognition on the best-seller lists. And he's got a film project, too. Unbelievable. Recognizing that I could not even begin to write as well as he does, even to save my life, I nonetheless say to you that his style of dialog is childlike, and so is his plot development, at least as far as this particular work goes. I would be interested in someone else's take on this physician-author's ability and style."
3,Starts Out Great,"This book really had me hooked from the beginning but the author revealed the method too far into the beginning so you, the reader, have to spend 200 pages reading about people dying and having the lead character hunting around for clues when you already know how they are getting the diseases.Also, the ending did not fit in with the direction the book took at all. The way the hospital staff was acting you definately didn't think who was behind it all -- maybe if he provided some kind of explanation of why people responded the way they did it would be more plausible. For example, how did the culprits know that the hospital staff was on to them and order them killed?The books provides a plausible thing happening -- some wacko giving people weird diseases that you can order by mail with a credit card -- but the ending was lame to say the least."
3,Buy The Book; boycott the movie,"My advice is somewhat one-sided: ""if the plot interests you, spend the money on the book and stay far, far away from the movie. i Watched it with my wife yesterday. We paid far too much to see it in i-max? Nothing flew out of the screen. there was more 3 d in the old movie incredible journey. We were literally 50% of the audience on a Friday afternoon at Bridgeport plaza. The plot as described by reviewers in the novel makes a good techno yarn. The plot as translated to screen was a complete mish mash of cameo performance thrown at the audience in a helter skelter version. the technical aspects were dead on...the plot line had none of the individual tension of the novel. buy the book and take your time absorbing the details."
4,Overly long story,"I agree that this is a good medical thriller. But the story is too long. Too many diseases, too many deaths in the same manner. And at three quarters of it you know where does the diseases came from, so that make the reading a little heavy because you know that whatever they thought about the diseases is wrong. I don't know why, but 90% of RC's books are against Medicare or another Health Organization so I think that maybe RC started writing because he had a problem with one of these Organizations.Taking my jest apart, is a very readable book."
3,Contagion,"thought the ending was weak. Bringing in the sister was just..... o.k. Chained to a pipe, I guess it could happen...."
5,CONTAGION,"The moment my book CONTAGION arrived from Amazon,I was lost in the story. It was a fast readand I cannot wait to see the movie."
2,More of the same,"I've read other books by Robin Cook, and have enjoyed them. I didn't like this one, however.... I felt like the premise was faulty and the characters were cardboard. Maybe I've read too many of his books, or maybe he's written too many. He needs to try harder."
3,Cook's Contagion,"Unfortunately, this is not one of Robin Cook's best books. All of his books are similar with many of the same characters but a different plot. I like his medical mysteries but I found this one a bit dull and predictable."
1,He gets paid to write?,"""Contagion"", by Robin Cook, is not yet another disease apocalypse novel. Instead, it is more of an extended essay on the evils of for-profit hospitals and corporations that spend on advertising and worry about the bottom line rather than spending money to improve care.It's a flawed book. First and foremost is Cook's clumsy, wordy prose. The characters are two-dimensional, and the plot, despite being wildly improbable, somehow manages to be predictable. And the pacing is terrible! For example, the climax drags on and on long past when anyone smarter than a soybean would have figured out how the bad guys are going to get their just desserts. It's painful.I managed to finish the novel; I recommend that you don't start."
2,Perfect example of poor writing ruining a good story,"The characters were stereotypical and 2 dimensional, the dialog was wooden and stilted. The plot was sometimes contrived and senseless. The only reason I finished Contagion was to find out whodunit. The best I can say about it was that the story was strong enough to keep me reading, but that was one painful journey."
