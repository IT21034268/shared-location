3,"Good book, bad formatting","Riding on the Downton Abbey craze, I read the Kindle re-issue of this book. The information contained therein is very interesting. But it is clear that the book was simply scanned from the original paper version and it is almost impossible to sort out in e-reader format. What were probably boxed insets and sidebars to the main text in the paper book show up as random insertions scattered throughout the text. Very difficult to follow. Lots of uncorrected errors from the scanning, too. The word 'bed' consistently shows up as 'red', for instance. So - okay for content, but read the paper book."
3,Not for Kindle,"I LOVE this book, but not for my Kindle. There are MANY pictures, but they don't show up well on my Kindle Touch. Have asked for a hard copy for Christmas, just so I can see all the detail in the pictures."
3,Impressed,"A great research book about the American and British elite and their mating habits. Being accepted into these societies and the protocols in doing so. Disappointed that there was not a story line but a great and impressive history of the late 1800's.Queen Victoria and the Society of the ""Four Hundred"" in New York City was very interesting especially with the influx of ""New Money"""
4,To Marry an English Lord: Kindle edition,"This was a worthwhile read, but the editing was awful, that is if it was edited at all. The misspellings, incorrect words and phrasing occurred constantly. Perhaps this happened when the original was scanned. In any case, was anyone checking?"
3,interesting enough but not exciting.,I suppose it's the subject matter. One gets tired of readingabout similar young ladies doing similar things.Also similar milords marrying for money.
3,To marry an English lord,Very dry and had a lot of names rthat held no meaning and were only featured one time. It is definitely a historical account of a sliver of time.
3,how-to,This book isn't as entertaining as I had anticipated. So many names and family lines are hard to follow. It was not what I expected.
2,unbelievably stupid,"Im so sorry but this book's subject matter was the problem. The author simply listed all the wealthy women in late 1800's an early 1900's that went looking for a man from the UK so they might be titled - in other words they paid for a title. Im not sure what they really got from their actions because Brits are a bit hard to take to this day!The first part dealt with actual women and some information but the end dealt with their names, again plus additional names - I had hoped for more of a story. Don't waste your money."
2,I couldn't even finish it,"It started a little interesting, but quickly lost my interest. It's more of a who's who in NY society and how they got there."
2,Mostly boring,"I thought that this would be an interesting book about those who married into the nobiity, but for the most part, it was poorly written and dragged on and on."
2,Not for Kindle,"This book doesn't translate to Kindle. Pictures are tiny and in black and white (understandable) and they are nearly impossible to see. The book is organized in a way that is difficult to follow but undoubtedly would be less so in book form.It is the format I dislike, not the book."
2,waste of money,This book is very hard to read or understand because it jumps around and repeats the same information over and over. Nothing special or interesting here.
2,Confusing and convoluted,"Perhaps it would seem to be better organized if it were in print, but this book was thoroughly confusing and difficult to follow. Much of the information on American woman who married English lords is presented in illogical fashion. The second half does give the reader some information on the running of the huge country estates, which for fans of Downton Abbey like me is the reason to buy the book. Facts on dressing would be in with facts on who divorced whom or some other disjointed information. I wondered why the book ended with Kindle indicating 54% read. The remainder is a rehash of the women covered earlier and an extensive bibliography. I do not feel I got my money's worth on this purchase."
2,Great book / awful kindle translation,"This book was a fascinating read but it did not AT ALL translate to the kindle well. There were so many typos and the pictures were 1/2"" tall and blurry so it was disappointing not to be able to see them. Half the fun with historic books like these is seeing the clothes and jewelry as well as homes where these people lived. I feel deprived! Otherwise the subject matter kept me interested up through the last section which was a directory / synopsis of the heiresses mentioned in the book. This last part I did not read."
3,A little boring,"I guess if you had never read any books about the Bucaneers who left America to go to Britain and marry a lord then this might be more interesting. The more famous ones are in this book, but you also read about the boring ones too."
2,Interesting bit of history but poorly written,"Starts out interesting by explaining how & why the ultra wealthy American's auctioned of their daughters to English aristocracy and its historical significance. Unfortunately it goes down hill from there, becoming excessively repetitive and disjointed. Even disintegrating into a ""grocery list"" toward the end."
2,Confusing and convoluted,This book is poorly written or edited. It jumps around from topic to topic with no coherent flow to the ideas or topics. A waste of money...
3,Full of English history,If you're into English history this book is for you but it has too many sidebars to be an easy read. The authors researched the facts well but in doing so they go into too many details to make it an enjoyable read.
2,Doesn't translate well to Kindle version,"I wanted to like this book, honestly.I purchased the Kindle version so I could enjoy this on vacation. I'm not sure how the print version is, but there were several typos throughout the book. Plus, there was a disadvantage of the picture quality being very disappointing.As for the book itself, I admit that I struggled to finish it. Again, maybe it was the transition from book-to-Kindle that tainted my reading, but the contents seemed sloppy and a lot of information was repeated in different chapters.Overall, it's a very informative book which I think makes for a good research tool, but for reading leisurely it's not my first choice."
2,To Marry an English Lord,I thought this a very slow moving retrospective on English heraldry. Many books I've read contained more details and interesting stories without being dry and lifeless. Sorry I bought it.
1,disappointing,"The Kindle edition is a great disappointment, with poorly reproduced photos. Beyond that, there's the writing: repetitive and generally uninteresting. Deeply superficial overall!"
3,"Interesting, but lacked context","I read this primarily because I enjoyed ""The Buccaneers"" and am now an eager fan of Downton Abbey. It was particularly interesting to read some of the real stories of how these marriages worked out. However, I would have liked more context, including the political ramifications and what happened to the children of these marriages. How did this affect future political relationships between England and the United States?"
4,To Marry and English Lord,To Marry an English LordI was disappointed by the small size of the pictures.Ordered paperback for them.I alreadyhad this on Kindle.
5,Easy read,"I found this an easy read, the book was well written, nice to have some depth of these Ladies who had a huge impact, on English Society, and in turn on US Society as well!"
4,Kindle version has large number of typos,Interesting book which is a great choice if you are a Downton Abbey fan. The kindle version is okay but far far too many typos. Wish I bought the real book.
4,"Great book, Kindle version has many typos",The number of typos in the Kindle version are very distracting. Sometimes multiple typos per page. The content of the book itself is very informative.
4,Interesting Read,Interesting overview of the American fascination with marrying into (and financially supporting) the British aristocracy of the late 1800s/early 1900s.
5,History and Humor,"If you have an interest in the stories of American heiresses who married into the British aristocracy during the late 1800s and early 1900s, this is the book for you. I've had the original edition of this book for several years. The authors give the backstory of the new American plutocracy after the Civil War, and analyzes the different waves of heiresses from the Self-Made Girls to those with Pushy Mamas and Sporting Fathers; from bagging the aristocratic target to the often disappointing life after wedlock. The book is full of photos, cartoons and summaries, and written with tongue firmly planted in cheek -- it's not just a series of biographical sketches."
5,Don't be misled by the title,"Yes, it's an interesting subject but, in my opinion, merely a vehicle for much more interesting information written in a highly readable style with great wit. I've never before come across such a clear comparison between attitude and lifestyles of American and English high society during the Victorian era. I had also never realized how much Queen Victoria's strictness had been diluted by her heir. And I have certainly never seen so many interesting illustrations of the era in one book before - jewels, fashion and architecture with descriptions and explanations. By no means definitive or comprehensive, and not pretending to be, this books offers a wealth of detail which brings the entire period into much sharper focus and is by no means limited to the subject matter referred to in the title."
2,Disc 2 Doesn't Work,"I am not sure who is doing Amazon's quality control but literally 1/2 of the songs I download don't play from Amazon. Disc 1 works fine, and is great music. Disc 2 doesn't work. Last time I called Amazon with this problem they refunded my money but it doesn't help when a professional DJ count's of them for music needed for an event and 1/2 of it doesn't work."
2,disappointed jewelry collector,"Felt that it did not touch on alot of wonderful things that other artist (other than the ""biggies"") were doing."
5,Funny!!!!!,"A great movie, I loved it!!!! I am not usually a fan of old movies, but this was great. The acting was superb and the plot was well thought out."
5,One of the best movies of all time!,"My whole family loves this movie. We love every movie Cary Grant was in, but this is one of his all time best!"
4,Madcap comedy,"I purchased this for my two grandsons. They are in their early teens but they thoroughly enjoy this movie. When I found out how often they rented this movie, I purchased it for them. I guess good comedy doesn't really age. It's old but Cary Grant is a master at this kind of comedy!"
5,This is a wonderful Classic Oldie,"This is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen, with Gary Grant and Boris Karloff no less. Old style comedy without the filth that is prevalent in modern day comedy. It's wonderful, nostalgic, and incredibly funny."
4,"""Charge!"" cries Teddy Roosevelt","What a delightful movie. As always, Cary Grant is his own inimitable self, funny, engaging, handsome and employing his unique comedic gift. Cary manages to steal nearly every movie he has ever appeared in, but he is given a run for his money here by John Alexander, who delivers an hilarious performance as Theodore Roosevelt. Not only does Alexander bear a strong resemblance to Teddy, his dialogue and behavior are simply hilarious.Though a bit dated in places, this movie is sure to delight movie lovers of all ages. It's suitable for the children, who will get a kick out of the plot, but sophisticated enough for adults as well. Enjoy!"
5,first cary movie i saw,This is the first cary grant movie i saw. For the first one i saw i think this is a outstanding film. One of the things i thought it would not be was funny. But that changed my views from the beginning.I can not say much else but a outstanding film.
4,Wish there was a DVD color version,Was disappointed that it was black and white. Would have liked the color version that is available on VHS. Fun movie though.
5,Great Classic Movie,My child tried out for this high school play. We laughed so long! I think anyone who likes comedy would love this movie.
3,Too Over-The-Top for me,"I really wanted to lovet this movie, but just couldn't get past the frantic pace once Grant discovered what the ""lovable"" old ladies were doing. Too much yelling, talking over each other, rudeness, etc for my taste.Understanding it is considered a 'screwball' comedy, I still didn't find a lot of humor. I do love Cary Grant, but this isn't my favorite movie of his."
2,Really too silly,"I love old movies, but this was beyond silly. I know that it was supposed to be a comedy, but besides the hilarious Uncle Teddy, the rest of it was beyond ridiculous. Cary Grant's performance was even disappointing. He had to overact to pull off the script. I just didn't care for it at all."
2,Disappointing,"I love, love, looove Cary Grant. He was a brilliant actor and comedian, and I could look at his face for hours. Sigh. Why don't they make movie stars like that anymore? Did I tell you how much I love Cary Grant?But still, I found Arsenic and Old Lace to be terribly disappointing: a madcap comedy that's neither funny nor clever. Grant worked hard to try to keep it afloat, and there are a few laugh-out loud moments here and there, but most of the movie is tedious and feels terribly long."
1,arsenic and old lace,"I ordered this product not knowing ""ZONE 2"" is not able to be played in the US. Now I have a DVD that I can't play unless I move to England. I know it said zone 2, but I didn't realize I had to research a video sold in the US to US customers to see if it would play on my dvd player. Very dissatisfied."
2,Just Awful!,"Cary Grant shouts through the entire movie, which is way, way, too long. I ended up fast-forwarding it to see how it ended. I could not take any more yelling or bug-eyed double-takes.If you are a fan of the 3 stooges, you will love this movie. If you are a fan of Cary Grant, you will hate it (as he did)."
5,SLIDE SPLITTING COMEDY JOY RIDE,"I just loved this movie. Cary Grant is at his funniest. What do you get when you mix two crazy aunts, a somewhat normal nephew, a dash of poison and a few other black sheep in the family? Answer: 12 bodies in the basement. See the movie for yourself. I promise you won't be disappointed."
4,A nearly-perfect film,"AAOL is a rare animal -- a screwball black comedy that was, even as a play, fully intended to be way over the top. To that end, it works wonderfully; nearly every actor plays his or her role pretty much flawlessly (although it WOULD have been cool to see Karloff reprise his stage role...)Yes, Grant overacts, but so does almost everyone else; that was the point. The only thing that hurts the film a bit is that it begins getting a little too clever in spite of itself, with the overlapping dialogue and Grand Central comings and goings, and to this end, some parts are too stagy. Still, this one's a true keeper."
1,gold trader not working,i purchased the dvd and it didn't work so i sent it back and i have not recieved a new one or my money back won't use amazon again.
1,Perhaps the worst movie ever,"How do you get Cary Grant and Frank Capra to make one of the most boring, annoying movies ever? Promised as a black comedy, it is barely macabre and not funny at all. Seriously. You won't even smile. Poor Cary Grant apes for the camera to provide SOME life for this snoozer, and it just makes him look pathetic (and everyone else even more amateurish by comparison).This movie's fame and reputation are a classic are undeserved."
1,It Gave Me a Major Migraine,"This movie was loud and annoying. It seemed overplayed and exagerrated. I envision it as perhaps having been amusing on the stage, but on the screen it is abrasive. So many other people review it favorably that it made me think that perhaps I was just in a strange mood when I watched it. So, I later watched it again and had the exact same response.There is a character in this movie who thinks he's Teddy Roosevelt. He repeatedly screams ""Charge!"" and then runs up some stairs and slams himself in his bedroom. Everytime he did this my two-year old daughter awakened crying and my cat clawed my knee where he rested. If the scene had been amsuing I would have endured, but it was annoying.I love Capra and Grant films, but this is the glaring exception."
5,"Frank Capra's ""Arsenic And Old Lace""...","Two Sweet Old Ladies Have Found A Solution For Elderly Men With No Family Or Friends - They Kill Them...After Poisoning Them, They Grant Them A Proper Burrial In Their Cellar...Their Nephew, Mortimer (Cary Grant), An Obvious Party Pooper, Finds Out And Wants Them To Stop...A Delightful Comedy Crammed With Sparkling Performances...Coined The Phrase ""Ace In The Hole, Hey Johnny""...Starring Cary Grant, Pricilla Lane, Jack Carson"
3,arsenic and lace,the movir is a classic- but the dvd that i got --the sound on it was very poor-it would be normal sound and then go to were you could barely hear the movie. and it would do that thru the whole movie.. not good!!!!!!
4,Arsenic & Old Lace dvd,"Delightful Cary Grant movie, and sold at a great price. (I'd some some comparison shopping.) DVD was in excellent condition."
5,Hilarious!,"Arsenic and Old Lace is one of the funniest comedies of all time. Based on the hit Broadway show of the same name, it is about a drama critic who finds out that his aunts have been poisioning people (hence the title) out of a desire to help them (they only poison lonely old men) out of their misery. Anyhow, the dialogue is truly hilarious (""Insanity doesn't just run in the family - it practically gallops."") and the cast is great!Even though Cary Grant, who played the lead role, always said he disliked his performance in Arsenic and Old Lace (he complained that Capra pushed him into overplaying instead of his usual more restrained style) I think he was excellent! His expressions are priceless, and it is impossible to keep a straight face while watching his frantic movements about the house. The aunts are also quite good, as are the actors playing the other crazy brothers.All in all, this movie is a must have! If you haven't seen it already, you are in for a treat."
5,Hilarious! Frank Capra at his best!,"This film is one of director laureate Frank Capra's masterpieces. Cary Grant is superbly hilarious, and the supporting cast (including Raymond Massey and Peter Lorre) are outstanding.Theatre critic and confirmed bachelor Mortimer Brewster has finally tied the knot and is about to set off on his honeymoon - he just wants to let his dear spinster aunts in on the news. That is where normality stops and the fun begins! Although a Halloween honeymoon is hardly normal, things only get odder - and funnier!This classic film is for everyone - young and the young at heart. See it!"
5,Purchase Review,The product was exactly as described and arrived in a very short span of time. Excellent seller. I would use again.
5,Love this movie!,Have been looking forward to the release of this on dvd for a long time! It's so difficult to find the classics on any tv channels and sadly they appear to be scarce on dvd these days. Anyway this movie is very funny! My wife doesn't usually even watch classics and she loved it. Cary Grant was at his finest and the entire cast did a wonderfull job with this dark comedy.
3,More details please,"Overall a good work. Easy to read and the essays in the back our interesting and informative. That being said, I would like to see more information about why the authors made some of the decisions that they did. For instance, very little is said about why they separated the call of the first four apostles in Matthew and Mark from the call of the same four in Luke. Perhaps they are right, but the explanation they give is basically that there are too many differences. When you look at the passages the differences are far fewer than in several places that clearly refer to the same event (eg birth, resurrection). Thus I would like to see a detailed companion on the reasoning process of the authors."
5,Cozy's Big Day,We got this movie with a Little Tikes Safari Car that we bought for our son for Christmas. From the moment we started playing the movie until the end he was fascinated. He loves it and he wanted to see it again and again. I will buy the DVD with all the movies on it since my son is crazy about these characters. I had bought all kind of DVD's for him to watch but it seems that after a while he gets bored with them. He always have a big smile watching Cozy's Big Day. Our son just turn one year old.It's a wonderful product!!!!
5,Captivates the little ones!,"I was introduced to this DVD with an ad that runs at the start of other videos from Lions Gate: you know, Thomas the Tank Engine, Barney & Friends, etc. My nephews would NOT let me fast-forward through the ad, they absolutely loved watching the dog run around and chase the kids and their Cozy Coupe.That sold me on trying the actual item, and it holds their attention just like the ad, but for much longer! As of this writing I've ordered a second copy, so I can keep one for their visits to me, while they take one home to enjoy the rest of the time.This is a definite 5-star DVD for kids aged 2 to 5"
5,Great Movie!,I bought this for my two boys and they absolutely love it! It comes with a little Cozy Coupe Diecast Car that they love to play with. I would recommend this to anyone with little children. The only disappointment is that they don't have more DVDs!
3,not as shown,this picture clearly shows the bonus toy car with movie. No toy.Very disappointing .Walmart has the movie with toy for $5.
5,Little Tikes Land,"Very cute little movie, we love seeing all the little tikes toys in the story. Especially love the model cozy coupe that comes in the package."
1,boring,"I love true crime books, but this is by far the most boring and drawn out telling of events I've ever encountered. The author repeats the same thing over and over throughout the book, never really getting into great detail about the crime itself. Better off reading about the case on the internet. Do not recommend at all. Will not buy another book by this author."
1,What is the Deadly Secret? The Book is a Bore,I picked up this book at my local library - thank goodness I didn't actually waste any money on it! I live in Bellevue and picked up the book to see about the crimes that occured prior to my moving here. I was very disappointed in the writing style. It was not very detailed on dates and places and the writer seemed to repeat the same passages over and over. I kept waiting for it to end. Don't waste your time or money. I'd give it zero stars if I could.
5,Deadly Secreats,"This is a good book and showes just how far this lost kids will take Dungens and Dragons games and fantisy games to which they don't even know the difference from reality any more. These two boys put this plan together just to know what it feels like to kill. Where their warrning signs??? Yes, but no one took them seriously. Even Kim herself hear the rumors that he was gonna kill her, but just laughted it off. Wake up people!!! Some time threats made jokingly are really warnings. Even if you don't think that a certain person is capiable, you will be suprisied just what they are capable of when they snap or are pushed over the edge. I feel that EVERYONE is capable if their buttons are pushed enough."
1,I can't believe I thought this would be good!,"I used to be one of North's biggest fans, but this CD just showed me how wrong I was to his critics. Who cares about old interviews and 2 awful parodies. Secret Asian Man? Caucasian Man? These songs are old and played out. A parody is lost on the listeners if 75% of your target audience were born after the original song's release date. Please Mike, if their is going to be another CD, put more effort into it."
1,Real bad...,"...and who the hell is the target audience for this stale product? Middle-aged white racists who make a ton of money but are eager to prove themselves as ""working class""? North is a fraud and shameless self-promoter. This CD is a rip-off and I believe it exists only because no one had the guts to tell Mr. North it was a bad idea.Tell you what: give your money to a favored charity in lieu of supporting the man who single-handedly destroyed the greatest sports talk radio station in America & uses 50,000 watts of power to spew his prejudices and political naivete.North seeks attention like a child; don't encourage him and perhaps he'll quiet down and fade away into the ether of once-great Chicago radio personalities."
1,Starch,"What I hate was that I did not get the other starch that I thought I ordered...where it said ""buy both"" for a certain price. I got this one only and paid $9.00 for it which was ridiculous!!!!!"
1,Don't waste your money,"Don't waste your money. This compass doesn't work. I attached it to my rearview mirror as suggested on the packaging, only to learn that the compass was frozen on NW and didn't move when the vehicle changed direction. I took it off and tried other locations in the vehicle with no change. The direction float moves, but doesn't indicate any direction other than NW. If it didn't cost more in freight to return the unit than the actual cost of the compass, I'd send it back in a heartbeat. I think this is a good example of getting what you paid for."
1,If only it would work.,"I purchased this for use in my Ford Mustang and am very disappointed. It's calibration is distorted every place I tried: the rearview mirror, the entire windshield, the dash face and the dash top, all to no avail. Because it is MADE FOR REARVIEW MIRROR MOUNTING, I felt sure there would be no trouble with mounting it there."
1,What a JOKE!,This is the worst thing I have ever bought off of Amazon.The compass always points West.What a piece of crap.
2,Worth watching if Laurel & Hardy played the lead roles,"Great comedy centered around WW2. Kept shooting down the same Japanese pilots in every fight scene. Dogfights all looked the same. Japanese gunner squeezes off 5,000 rounds and misses every time. Duke squeezes off 1 round and down goes the zero in a ball of flames.(Supplies are short. Must use that ammo wisely) If this is considered one of the Dukes finest it just doesn't say much about the rest of his career. Not a very exciting or good rah rah rah film. Even for 1942."
3,Not much history,Was in hopes of learning more about the Flying Tigers. Kind of hokie story line. Not worth the time. Hubby likes the flying but he always does.
3,"A hoot, but little to do with the AVG","Of course this flick has nothing to do with the real-life Flying Tigers. (All the action takes place BEFORE the Pearl Harbor attack.) I enjoyed the airplanes, especially the ""Nakajimas"" tricked up from training planes. (How come the makers of this B movie knew what a Ki-27 looked like, when most later historians ofthe Flying Tigers believed they spent their time battling Zeros?)The Duke's line about ""termites"" is a B movie classic. Great fun. Just don't take it seriously :)"
2,George Garcia,"A well acted movie but it is not very historicaly correct. I figure it was not historicaly correct due to the fact that it came out during the war almost within a year of the time they are trying to act. It is more of a ""Propaganda"" towards the enlisting to fight against the Japanese during the Second World War. Other than this it was a very good movie and I enjoyed it....WW2 Historian"
2,Not One of Wayne's Best,"I love the History Channel, have infinite respect for the AVG, love John Wayne films, and lived two years in the part of China where Flying Tigers is set. So, you'd think I might adore this film? I had hoped so, but unfortunately Republic pictures made this opus on the cheap.John Wayne plays a fictional commander of the American Volunteer Group, somewhere between Claire Chennault and Pappy Boygnton. He does his best to carry the film, and does OK, but he can't carry it alone. Bad effects, cheap stock footage, flimsy sets, and bad script all plague TIGERS.Republic made little effort to hide the California filming location and even used the WRONG PLANES! There is little mention of the OSS-AVG connection, and the film was made too early on to be a good history of the AVG, even if it were accurate.The heroes of the AVG deserve better than TIGERS; this film isn't a tribute to them, it's a sloppy, propaganda film that does them little service."
5,Flying Tigers DVD,This was a Christmas present. Recipient was very satisfied with the movie. Great website to search for hard to find movies.
4,A peek at the AVG,"OK, in retrospect not a good movie to learn history by (the American Volunteer Group was primarily made up of U.S. military pilots ""loaned"" to China) nor was it a special effects spectacular (the cockpits of those P40s sure were roomy!) but it did tell the story of brave Americans trying to hold off the tide of the Imperial Japanese air forces. The story of American pilots flying against the Japanese at odds which would make most pilots think twice is a true one. This movie was produced after Pearl Harbor and helped to focus American attention on Japan's aggression, a subject which got little play until after bombs actually began falling on U.S. territory. Well worth finding and watching!"
5,Great!,I bought these for my six year old daughter's zombie birthday party. We made chocolate ears for party favors and they were a hit!
2,Disappointing,"This version, while sticking closer to the actual tale, is overacted, making it seem more suitable for the stage than for film."
3,This Anne is Megan Follows not Kim Braden,"I ordered this series a while back thinking it was the one done in 1975, staring Kim Braden. Big mistake! It was the one with Megan Follows. Please update this."
3,sex kitten,"Though a good actress, Kim Braden didn't fit the insecure about her looks but is smart Anne girl. She looked like a sex kitten and not the stubborn yet spirited Anne Shirley. The music is rather blah as many BBC period movies are, though I enjoy many of them, most of the time their music is forgettable like this Anne Shirley version. I also enjoyed the scenery in the Sullivan version because they were shot on location unlike this BBC version. Yes, this is very true to the book and it's no wonder the Anne fanatics or should I say the UK residence prefer this; however, I didn't feel the kindred spirit of Anne whereas the Sullivan version you can feel love, joy, growing pains that Anne went through. There was a sense of connection with the PBS version as if they've invited you to their home. The BBC version felt aloof and distant as if you're watching a stage play and when the show is over the memory is gone. The PBS, why its been declared a classic and a favorite is because it has endured."
1,Horrible,"I can't believe I bought this thing. The acting is reminiscent of a high school play. The sets are atrocious (think High School), and the actors are unpleasant to look at. Do not waste your money with this version (the Sullivan production is infinitely better). Also, the color is off. There's nothing positive about this dvd, sadly."
3,Anne of Avonlea,"I loved the stories of Lucy M. Montgomery and was hoping for more from the BBC. I was emotionally disappointed in this version. Kim Braden was an adorable Anne but the screen play lacked emotion and substance where it was important. Anne and Gilbert scenes were short and flipant. You would never have known Gilbert and Anne had any feelings for each other by the scenes. I did like the inclusions of the real story line from Ms. Montgomerys books. They were true to the real story and that pleased me. The whole college years, the group gatherings of all the young people etc made the books come to life but then the rest of the story left you feeling unsatisfied and empty. The ending was the worst. I prefered the longer scene in the book and the other ending in the Megan Fallows version. It said more in silence than any writer could say."
3,Spolied by the newer version,"No doubt had I viewed this before i was familiar with the Megan Follows character I would have enjoyed this more. It is very British and ""stage play like"", and perhaps it even follows the books a little more closely. But it is undeniable that Megan, Colleen Dewhurst, and Richard Farnsworth set the bar for these characters. Indeed, the Anne Shirley in those series captured the precocious younger girl, but grew wonderfully up before our eyes. This version is good, but I felt ""why bother, when the other is definitely better""."
4,"Awesome light, Still the Brightest Compact Light Around","I bought 3 of these, one at first but then 2 more for different parts of the house and to take camping. These lights are superior to just about anything else out there. My off-roading buddies have all bought one, and we can count on each other if we need to borrow a light.4 stars because 2 of my 3 do not work any more. I bought new rechargeable battery packs and several replacement bulbs, but this isn't the problem. Neither one will charge. If you wiggle the flashlight in the charger fixture the red charging LED will flicker dimly. But as soon as you let go, it goes out and it will not charge. I went so far as to take one completely apart and couldn't see any loose connections. I will have to send them in for repair.Otherwise this light deserves 6 stars and I highly recommended."
1,"Mistake! Read carefully before clicking ""buy""","This e-version is a review of the book ""Two types of new theism : knowledge of God in the thought of Paul Tillich"". It's not comprehensive, only 3 pages in length.Please read the details of this before purchasing it.I made an error thinking that it would be an electronic version of the book. Alas! A waste of money."
4,Serious burn factor!,"I wanted to try this long time ago and i mean long as in a couple of years back, but it is a very hardcore style of exercising. when i was interested in HIIT type of exercise, Ilaria is the way the go. The only draw back is, some exercises such as the sit up and reverse crunches can put a lot of strain on your neck area because of the amount of reps you have to do. but regardless it is a good exercise workout. I recommend this to anyone who is interested in looking for some washboard abs."
4,You won't hear a better Side A,"This album was my introduction to Joan Armatrading's music. And, as it is usually the case, it is my favorite of her albums. The inventiveness with which she incorporates Reggae in her music almost creates a new genre. The first half of this album is as good as you'll ever hear. To add my voice to the chorus, ""The Weakness in Me"" is a masterpiece. If only the second half was as good as the first. Then again, not even the Beatles could have made that good an album."
3,Armatrading's trailblazing nature,"Joan Armatrading is naturally a trail blazer, leading the way for artists such as Tracy Chapman and others. Armatrading is an excellant song writer whose vocal stylings remind me of early Odetta recordings. My favorites on Walking Under Ladders are Romances, At The Hop and Only One. Armatrading's influences has spanned generations and cultures."
2,"Amerivoice is false advertising, theft of service","Amerivoice has falsely advertised ""unlimited service"" and is ripping off consumers. I had this for 1-1/2 years but now they are strictly enforcing time limits. Did work good and quality was excellent but now its only a block of 1200 minutes per month for $29.95, not unlimited. They are monitoring all your calls on spreadsheets, as soon as you go over the allottment they will e-mail you a 5-day cancellation notice unless you renew and confirm service at 3.9 cents per minute. Obviously Amerivoice can no longer fulfill the unlimited long distance service that was advertised in media and on packaging at Office Depot, Costco. Amerivoice should be at top of the list for FTC enforcement action as well as a class action lawsuit. Sprint and SBC now both offer true unlimited long distance for an additional $20 per month as part of local phone packages, a much better and cheaper choice"
1,"Just a bad album, and a bad move for a legendary band","This album moves from the speakers and into the room with all the aplomb of a very irritating bowel movement. This was a horrible step for the band: slick-sounding goth/glam/shock-rock shlock with the goal of creating an audience outside their native Italy and ""making it big"" overseas, which is just a treasonous move for a band with their esteemed past.To the last reviewer: Steve was not even an original member of the band. ""If he weren't born in Italy!""- just an misinformed statement here: The Italian music scene has consistently been one of the best in the world. In progressive (Jacula, Paul Chain, Goblin, Antonius Rex, etc), in dark rock (Black Hole, early Death SS, etc), in metal (Mortuary Drape, Bulldozer, etc)Check out nearly anything else from Italy and it will blow the roof and doors off this pitiful, disappointing, and nearly treasonous release."
1,Bah,"This album was a dissapointment for me. It will probably do quite well to attract alot of new fans, but it fails to capture the grandeur of the last record. With the exception of the song Ishtar, this is a collection of glam-rock anthems and gothy sap.A very dull listening experience."
4,just started reading it,"First of all, I love Watson's pencil drawings, which is why I bought the book, that and I need to work on my composition. The illustrations are mainly small black-and-white photos of paintings. While one may wish to see the pictures larger and in color, for the purposes of studying composition, the colorless versions are fine because it forces you to look at the values.The book was written in the fifties, and Watson quotes contemporary artists on composition. Some of the quotes are a bit pretentious, but still have something worth noting.When I have read further, I will report back on my observations. So far I have learned about how the human eye tends to move across the picture. We will see if I can find a practical use for this later in the book."
5,Night calls,"One of Joe Cockers projects. according to some, these songs were written while down and out on drugs. one of the lowest times of his life, searching for help."
5,A great read....excellently written,"If you like to read and enjoy excellent writing, and are interested in the general subjects of entheogens, shamanic divination, and real-life adventure, then this book will be a real treat to read ! ! I loved it ! ! If this book jibes with your psyche, then it's definately for you; if not, then it's just 550 pages that other people would love to read , but 550 pages that you wouldn't."
4,Excellent content but sub-standard reading quality on tape,"Next to Darling's other book 'Zen Physics', this is one of the best books I have ever 'read'. Darling is like a cross between Alan Watts and Carl Sagan. The worldview he presents beautifully unifies science and mysticism. Unfortunately, the reading quality on the audio tape is very sub-standard. The speech is slurred, consonants are dropped, and quite a few words are mispronounced, making the listening experience frustrating and detracting from the great content. I wonder why they didn't hire an actor to read this, like so many other audio tapes I have purchased? I wish I could find this work as a book rather than a tape."
3,SCIENCE CANNOT SETTLE THE QUESTION OF LIFE AFTER DEATH,"David DarlingSoul Search:A Scientist Explores the Afterlife(New York: Villard/Random House, 1995) 193 pagesAltho this book by a science writer begins with a scientific basis,by the end it has veered off into Eastern mysticismas the answer to the problem of death.Some themes discussed: beliefs in life after death,ancient to modern---religious, philosophical, & scientific;near-death experiences; consciousness and self-consciousness;memory and illusion; perceptions of time and space;accepting absorption of individual (illusory) consciousnessinto the cosmic consciousness.If you would like to read better books on life after death,search the Internet for the following exact words:""IS THERE LIFE AFTER DEATH? THE BEST BOOKS"".James Leonard Park, skeptic."
2,No drilling...but you need a cutting torch...,"I bought this for my 2003 Ford Sport Trac 2 wheel drive expecting an easy, no problem install based on the description. Not the case by a long shot. No drilling is required, but the receiver will not mount at all without using a torch and cutting the lower portion of the bumper bracket to allow the receiver to pivot and line up to accept the 2 perpendicular bolts. The description also indicates that a hitch plug cover was to be included. It was not, although Amazon did allow an adjustment to my bill to compensate. All in all, the receiver seems pretty robust, but don't think it will be an easy 10 minute install."
5,Does the job,"Completely ""plug and play"" on my 1997 Mercury Mountaineer. Took 10 minutes to install, no drilling required. I have a full size spare, and it clears that without issue. The tire will lower and raise without hitting the hitch. Very happy.*edit*If you are buying this to tow something and need trailer light hookups I also bought this and it works great:http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002Q7YA6/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00"
1,Book full of INCOMPLETE explenations of excel concepts,"this book is good, if you already have years of experience with excel. It is horrible if you are learning it for the first time. These authors know the subject well, but struggle to clearly articulate that information to people who don't know excel well. I highly recomend trying any book except this one or any others from these authors. They do know excel but they don't know how to explain it for those who don't."
4,"""Chase"" This Down","I have admired tenor saxophonist Charlie Rouse since I first discovered Thelonious Monk more than twenty years ago, but only recently have I managed to check out his recordings as a leader. Actually, this Bethlehem album finds him as a co-leader with fellow saxman Paul Quinichette, from what I can only assume was made in the late 50s as the liner notes don't say. However, they do inform us that Rouse and Quinichette's colleagues on this jam session were Hank Jones and Wynton Kelly alternating on piano, Freddie Green on guitar, Wendell Marshall on bass and Ed Thigpen on drums. This disc is becoming increasingly rare so interested parties should chase down ""The Chase Is On."""
5,Amazeeeng!!!,"I had been looking for this album for the past 5 years. My parents used to listen to this when I was young, and even as young as I was, I still appreciated Herb Herpert's Fandango album. The only reason it took me so long to find it was that I forgot the name of the artist; the only thing on the album that I remembered was ""cocoloco"", one of the tracks on the album. It wasn't until recently that I remembered that the album had ""fandango"" written on it. I tried it and voila, there it was staring back at me. I am just so glad I found it. It is a beautiful album. I listen to it alongside Lee Oscar's ""in the rain"" album. Give that a shot too, awesome album as well."
4,PIE Input module,"Installation was quick and easy. Works OK, except the gain adjustment does not adjust both channels equally. I'm having to run at lower gain than I'd like to keep the channel levels in balance."
2,Too thin,"These guards are too thin to offer much protection. They will help a pick slide off, but wear out quickly. They will not stop finger nail damage if you get carried away playing flamenco. You can find thicker material at the Stewart MacDonald website."
3,no that great,These guards are too thin to offer much protection. . They will stop finger nail damage if you get carried away playing fflamenco ? I dont know will see
1,This is crap,dont buy it . go with the ones that you have to cut yourself.just use an exato knife. presto
3,Not what I thought I was ordering,"I thought I was ordering the Pedini Femme, which has no buckle. too confusing and I have returned this one to order the Femme version. I'm sure it is a fine shoe, but knowing there was a big difference in the Pedini's would have been nice to know up front.thanks."
4,Came in good shape and within a week,"The product I ordered came in good shape and within a week. The only thing I did not like is that it was a picture I was going to be framing and the packaging did not say "" DO NO BEND "" on it. My mail carrier bent it and put it in my mailbox. Luckily the picture was fine but it should have said DO NOT BEND on it to ensure it came without damage. Other than that I was very pleased with the product and it was CHEAP !!!"
2,Not as innovative as I would have liked..,"I was really hoping for something more innovative for vegan carribean cooking. Some of the recipes are interesting, but most of them I feel like I could have come up with myself."
1,Wrong CD,The above 2 reviews are not for the CD B000NQPT66 as shown above. I ordered this CD and it is not acoustic double bass but Techno c**p. Amazon don't want to reply to my email to correct this situation.There is a DVD available Bass Instinct Live in vienna EAN:5032711068357 (eBay have it - not Amazon as at Jan 2013).
2,A disappointing album from AC/DC's mid-80s slump,"This album sits alongside AC/DC's previous effort, ""Flick Of The Switch"", as their least interesting.There are two really good songs on ""Fly On The Wall"", namely ""Sink The Pink"" and ""Shake Your Foundations"" (both of which can be found on the soundtrack album ""Who Made Who""). The rest is cookie-cutter mediocrity...the lyrics seem forced and cliched, the music is largely uninspired, lacking the memorable hooks and riffs of AC/DC's best songs, and Brian Johnson's voice is mixed too far into the background.""Fly On The Wall"" was a commercial and critical failure, and it's not hard to understand why. It's steeped in mediocrity, and comparing it to ""Highway To Hell"", ""The Razors Edge"", ""Let There Be Rock"" and the greatest hard rock album ever, ""Back In Black"", makes it look like even more of a disappointment.Mostly for completists."
3,good book,"acceptable, ace*, admirable, agreeable, bad, boss*, bully, capital, choice, commendable, congenial, crack*, deluxe, excellent, exceptional, favorable, first-class, first-rate, gnarly, gratifying, great, honorable, marvelous, neat*, nice, pleasing, positive, precious, prime, rad, recherché, reputable, satisfactory, satisfying, select, shipshape, sound, spanking, splendid, sterling, stupendous, super, super-eminent, super-excellent, superb, superior, tip-top, up to snuff, valuable, welcome, wonderful, worthy"
3,Ehh,Kind of hard getting used to ready the old? English. Slow start with a quick finish. Stupid review wanted 4 more words before submitting a review. So I gave it 15
1,"There is nothing to review--Hey, where is the product ?","I need my money back, as nothing loads, just the address bar and I met with a blank screne. My rating is 0 so far. I had to put the 1 star in for the rating."
3,Not Their Greatest Effort,"AC/DC experienced something of a slump in the late-80's, none of their albums fairing particularly well. In 1990, they made a comeback with this album. While many hailed it as their greatest work since Back In Black, I personally think there is a lot of filler. The first few songs are dynamic: Moneytalks, Thunderstruck, The Razor's Edge, and Mistress For Christmas. Bur after that, the songs almost immediatly go downhill. Most of the second half is just filler. I can't say I listen to the second half a lot, because it is not really worth it. This would have gotten two stars, but the first half saves it from that fate."
4,"AUTRALIA""S AC/DC KICK...",AC/DC ROCK MAN. There Australia's own boys rocken and rollin. This by far one of there best ablems with guitars screching and drums thumping. The best songs on the ablem are ROCK YOUR HEART OUT and ARE YOU READY FOR A GOOG TIME. AC/DC keep on Rocking Australia's own boys Yaeh Woo! AC/DC ROCK!!!!
2,It's Worth Seeing,"The movie was well done, and the acting is good. My personal thought is that the book is much better. Read the book for more insight into the characters and for a better scope of the whole situation. The ending (just like in the book) in unpredictable, which makes the movie worth watching."
5,very well done,"If you are a fan of George Eliot or just the classics, then you should love this. Emily Watson and James Frain are great in this. Worth checking out!"
3,Disappointing,"If you hate to read, this ""book"" is for you. If you want the facts and nothing but the facts, this ""book"" is for you. I had read an account of the Glensheen murders yrs ago, and thought I was buying another true crime novel. Sadly, for me at least, this is a scant few pages of nothing but the facts."
2,served the purpose very well,"Bought this book to share with my friend before she came to Duluth,MN and would get to tour the Glensheen Mansion. It is fun to read about its history before going on the tour.The book arrived where I had designated it to be sent and its condition was good even though it was not new."
3,GOOD BUT NOT GOOD!,This would be an excellant deal except the time expires every 45 days and that is a pain for someone that dosn't talk much. Overall i would not get the phone or the ...card unless you talk alot on the phone.
5,"Finally, something for the rest of us!","I love this AT&T; prepaid wireless plan! Believe it or not,there are a few of us left that only want a cell phone foremergencies or quick conversations. $10.00 for 45 days is a great deal....just check out the price for a monthly plan.Add another $10.00 minumum before the 45 days is up and anyminutes you have left carry over! This plan offers voice mail, text messaging, different tones and other extras! Be sure to check out this wireless plan if you don't already have it!"
5,Exactly what I need,"This plan is good because I only need it to communicate with family members while one of us is away. I do not need a plan that gives me hundreds of minutes just so I can chat in the car or at the grocery store, I do my chatting on my home phone. Also, you can get cards cheaper, ebay has a seller that sells the $100 card for $95 and I get text messages from AT&T wireless for 10% savings on refills. I am happy with the plan and it gives me peace of mind when I am out traveling, I always have it there for emergencies. Also, I bought my phone from HSN and it only cost $21.00 after the two rebates, It cost $99 at Target, so shop around!"
1,Credit card sold,"Somebody hacked into my account and this company was great handling this issue, and I would remend this company to everybody, thanks again."
2,Interesting as a cultural history of the 1930's,"A Great Depression morality tale, wherein the outlaws are really good boys who love their mother, and the capitalists and banker are really black-hearted crooks who prey on the innocent. I'd give it one star for its sheer tedium but a very youthful Roy and Trigger look terrific and who doesn't like Gabby Hayes? As usual in these old oaters, the horseriding is spectacular. Roy has one love song, while playing the pump organ. The movie inspired me to look up the history of the James gang to find out what they were actually like."
1,"Good to see Dale and Roy, but........","This movie is a little misleading. The run time is listed as 63 minutes. And 63 minutes is the original version run time.However the actual run time of the movie is 51 minutes. There is a pre and post movie interview with Dale, Roy, and Dusty which makes up the rest of the run time. Now seeing them is worth the money I paid for the movie, but I was after a full length film.I have been told that all the Happy Trails have the edited versions of Roy's movies. I'm not sure this is true...I've only bought this one."
4,More Inspector Queen's case than Ellery's,"This is a fun read, using one of the basic mystery plots...an ill-assorted group of characters brought together by a promise of wealth and of course somebody ends up dead. True authorship of this novel is murky being one of those written during the time of the TV series. However, it is snappy writing and well worth the reading."
5,Great Choice for an Older Child,"My son when through an astronomy phase in 4th grade. He wanted a telescope, but the prices and storage issues made me say ""no"". This pair works great and for an novice, you can see excellent views of the planets and stars. They are very well made and durable."
4,Not bad,These binoculars came in just over a week. They came withA bag and 2 sets of covers for the objectives. They are big and a littleBit heavier than a 50 mm pair. But the view through the eyepiece is pleasant.They bring out the jupiter moons easily and our moon looks really good.
2,meade astrobinoc,The binocs came in a box that said travel binoculars. Apparently same binocs are marketed different purposes. The rubber coating made it hard to put in the carry strap. The main thing was it did not focus properly. I sent it back and got another higher priced brand from another vendor. I have a Meade telescope that works fine. I understand Meade backs their products and will make things right but I did not want the hassle.
2,Not worth it,"I hate stupid ""interview discs"" like these because they're always so stupid and pointless. As much as I love Whitney, this one was no exception. A waste of money."
1,Not for beginners,"This is strictly a demostration DVD with no verbal instructions. It might be good for others, but I did not benefit from it."
1,Photo Misrepresents Product,The latches I received are very light weight with a dull finish. Poor quality. The photo does not accurately represent the product. Very disappointed.
1,poor quality,I bought this for my husband as a gift. I washed it before giving it to him. He found 2 holes in it. I would not buy this item again. It was over priced for the quality. P. Johnson
1,It's not even worth that one star I am giving,"People, have mercy! How anyone could write anything positive about this tedious thing!? They must have been paid to do it.Some, like the author of this thing, should have been banned from making films. He doesn't even use his real name. I am not suprised. If I created such crap, I would have done it anonymously too!There are not words to describe how stupid and unbelievable is the script. It reaches the lowest levels of the silliness bottom.Acting...There is no such thing as acting here.After I saw ""Aaron...albeit sex hero"" yesterday, I thought it can't get worse than that. Well, apparently it can and it got.LOSS OF TIME!!!"
1,If You want to know if the review is good,"Please do take a look over the people who have sort of good reviews about this bad film, with very amateur acting,they usually just have a pair of reviews or even worst they only review this only film, check this out please, and dont buy this terrible film. renti it if you please."
5,Spiritual gay comedy,"Anyone who has lost their true love and found love again will enjoy this movie. It takes a serious subject, losing a lover, and puts a comic twist on it. I highly recommend this gay spiritual comedy. Sountru has done an amazing job as writer, director and producer.You can't always get what you want but we get what we need. Sometimes what we need is right there in front of us and don't even realize it. David Polizzi"
2,not worth the time,"it was a very difficult movie to follow. They jump into the angle without any reason. Then the characters are not believeable at all, very high schoolish acting. The ending is also extremely unbelieveable. You expect and hope that the lead will wide up with the guy, but this was basically stupid."
5,Enlightening,"I have to admit that this is what I consider to be the first real ""african-american"" history book that I have come across in my school years (although I had to find it on my own). I can only pray that maybe my grandchildren and greatgrandchildren will have the opportunity to recieve their lesson in african american pride in public/private schooling. But today, students remain subjected to a view of our past in a perspective that completely slants our perception of who we are."
4,Know Thyself,"This book has many illustrations and pictures. 95% of the sculptures in Egypt have their noses destroyed, but look carefully and you can see that the base structure of the nose is broad and African. ""you can fool some people sometimes...""Overall, the book is well put together. Lots of topics and great photo section."
4,Basic Information for the Neophyte,"This book is a good start for all new students of Afrocentric Studies. This give a basic overveiw of information that has been researched by master teachers such as Dr.John Clarke, Dr.Ben, Gerald Massey, John G.Jackson, G.M. James, and many others. I would highly recommend this book to the highschool student as well as the freshman of college. I would also recommend this book as a refresher for the advance student of African Studies. This book can be used much like a christain uses a bible concordence."
5,Contents are on Point,"The product was delivered successfully the book was in fairly good shape. The contents within this book are amazing and startling, it makes you THINK. Alot of reserach was put into finding and locating our [this] lost history - I wish for every (Black) race to read it."
5,Great Beginner's Book,"I recommend for beginners.There is one major contradiction that was glaring and feel compelled to speak on it. The author when discussing the Egyptian calendar that is in use all over the world he says, ""This calendar is supposed to be based on the year that Jesus the Christ was born (although the actual date is unknown).""Now the author has already explained earlier that Mary, Joseph and Jesus are simply copies of original holy trinity, i.e. Ausur, Aset,and Heru. He explained in detail how the new religion of Christianity by the Roman and Greeks adopted Africans mythological characters and discussed the original creation story. We now know Ausar(Joseph), Aset(Mary), Heru(Jesus) are the same characters just a different name. The Greeks called Ausur (Osiris), Aset(Isis) and Hero(Horus). Now he forgot himself and made Jesus aka Heru a historical, real life character."
1,I did not get what I ordered,"I ordered a set of 4 ornaments and when I received it there were only 3. I contacted the seller by email and waited months and never heard anything back. A simple ""sorry"" would have been good enough for me, but with no reply I feel that the seller doesnt seem concerned with their quality of product or customer service. I would not reccomend buying from them and I never will again."
2,Some of the worst Nyman I've heard.,"Granted, there are bits and pieces of other favorites floating around in here, but as a whole I really hated it. I'm a devoted Nyman fan, but this is simply not his best work."
5,Racism 101,"I think that the foundation for racism is never taken a serious look. It bewilders me how both educated and uneducated people can come to the conclusion to dislike or even hate others even with the facts put on the table. I blame most of this on public and private education institutions. Schools today have no common sense or logic courses. Without a fact based program to show or teach people the effects of what can happen in a common sense lacking environment, society is left only to tradition and upbringing. I think that Nightline made a great effort in analyzing the racism crises and can serve as a spark to the flame for change in America."
4,Great wooden toy for teaching object manipulation,"I love the bright colors, the retro design of the robots, and the fact that they're wood. My boys love balancing them and making all kinds of robot shapes. My only critique is that the paint isn't very durable and if you play with them on a hard surface, the edges of the paint chip relatively quickly. Other than that, the toy is great!"
5,huge fan!,"Bought these wood stacking robots for my 4 year old twin boys Robot Birthday Party and it was a huge hit. All the kids played with them, they were great table decor and my boys have played with them every day since. Love it!... great deal and a lot of fun for around $10."
4,Great Fun,"I agree with all of the other reviews -- this is a really fun toy. My son (3.5 years) received it as a gift and now we stack robots every night before bed. I can only imagine what happens when you add 2 or 3 more sets to the mix; right now we are having plenty of fun with the original 9 robots. What's nice is that my son can do the basic configurations on his own, or I can help him with the more advanced ones."
5,Robot Stacking Blocks,"This is a wonderful toy. I bought for a 5 year old and he loves them. If I had known just how much fun he would have with them, I would have bought 2 sets. He loves looking for creative ways to stack them."
2,Disappointed,"My son was so excited about this toy. He's crazy about robots. Unfortunately, the paint started chipping from day one. The next day I noticed it was not just the paint, but wood corners were chipping off everywhere. Cheaply made - especially for a toy that is intended to be knocked down! It's obviously a different toy than the one reviewers talked about years ago in these reviews. I wish they would go back to the quality product they used to have, because I would never recommend these to anyone with the way they are now."
3,great fun but poor quality,"I bought these for my 2 years old who loves robots and as expected he loved these toys and played with them for hours right out of the box. Unfortunately after those hours of play I noticed that the paint was chipping. I wasn't thrilled about that, but figured he was knocking them down etc. so I guess I expected some scuffs. However, upon further inspection, I noticed that the ""wood"" was chipping. Come to find out it is not wood but MDF. At first I thought I was getting a great value for a wooden toy but now I feel that I over payed and was ""under-informed"" about the real material used to make these. He loves them but I wonder how long they will even last."
4,Fun and challenging toy,"I bought the stacking robots for my 5 yr old grandson. It's a great toy to play with for him and anyone over 3 yrs old. It's hard to find a toy that both adult and children like to play together. It is a problem solving toy wherein there are so many ways to stack them it becomes challenging. I bought 2 packs, one is only good for one person to play. I did make a mistake and had them gift wrapped, it cost $4 per pack to have them wrapped even though they were sent in the same package. Also, I requested a gift card that was not included, so if I had not let my daughter know they were coming my grandson would not have know who sent them."
5,Creative Little Robots,"I just LOVE these robots. I've bought probably eight sets so far for friends kids all over the world. They are very creative when you get down on the ground and start to work out how to stack them in different ways. I took sets home to Australia to two 5 year old twins and their 18 month old sister. The boy out of the twins took all the sets for himself and started an elaborate stacking design which (of course) the female twin knocked over as soon as he was done. They are not available in Australia so its always nice to give a gift the parents have never seen before. I do notice the price has recently increased. I used to buy them from Amazon for $10.00 but now they are full price at $15.00. Come on Amazon, give us back the discount."
1,So disappointed,"I ordered this as a present for my friend's son.The box that robots were packed in arrived already opened and robots were chipped and had pencil marks on them.Obviously the toy has been used!Giving it as a present is out of the question and returning requires a lot of work and time,in a nutshell I live overseas and even simple things like returning something are actually a problem.After years of ordering through Amazon and occasionally getting things with a little crack here,chip there,I am over it!By the way,the toy is actually fun,but I didn't want,nor did I pay for,a second hand one."
4,Fun for years to come!,"I bought two sets of this item for my nephew's 2nd birthday. So far his favorite thing to do is knock the stacked robots over, but he will definitely learn to do more with these robots. Am planning on getting some for my daughter as well!!"
5,Cool toy,"This toy was a hit with my 4 year old. The back of the box has different tower designs, and my child loves to go through and build them each one at a time. Her uncle who gave her this also had a lot of fun playing with it, and he's almost 30! Good quality, cool toy."
2,harder,much harder to stack than I thought. the child was a little disappointed at not being at the riht skill level.
4,Read.. Take it in...Learn.. Go for your goals,This book is Great! It is a must read for those who have struggled and need to search for that inspiration and motivation that is deep inside. He reminds us that through all of our challenges as long as we don't give up we can not fail. If you haven't read it. Get it now!
2,Probably his weakest,"I am very fond of the standard Cat records: ""Tea"", ""Teaser"", ""Buddha"", ""Mona Bone Jakon"". My personal favourite is ""Catch Bull at Four"". I have never heard ""Izitso"" but otherwise I believe ""Foreigner"" to be his poorest. That's why this record was hard to find even in the LP days. His '60's recordings even have more interest in my view. If you are one of the people who believes in the principle of boycotting Joe Islam because he supports the murder of the heroic Salman Rushdie, then ""Foreigner"" is as good a place to start as any. Don't buy it -- support freedom of speech in the face of state-sponsored terrorism, and buy a couple of Rushdie books from Amazon instead. Don't forget: One of Rushdie's editors was killed -- with the approval of that fanatic Mr. Islam."
5,In fact a great album,"I am not very familiar with the works of Cat Stevens. In fact apart from his chart hits the only record I know well is Foreigner Suite. I have been adding to my music collection lately and decided on some Cat Stevens. I have been reading the reviews of his albums and was amazed to learn that Foreigner Suite is regarded as a poor record.I say amazed because Foreigner Suite is a brilliant record and has prompted me to buy 4 more Cat Stevens albums. I especially like the 18 minute long track called Foreigner Suite but I like all the tracks on this album. The 18 minute long track is engaging, emotionally satisfying and developes into a coherent whole. I am a lifelong Bob Dylan fan and I give this track the same respect I give to Dylan's work.Don't worry about the poor reviews if you are thinking of buying this record. The man has created a masterpiece."
5,Great stuff.,"Being a Cat Stevens fan, I think the biggest reason I liked this album was that ""Foreigner Suite"" was one whole side. Hey, the more the better. Something about all of his music just makes you think!"
2,"Like Old Navy, minus the clothes","This album lacks the healtfelt honesty of his early work, and lacks the creative energy of his later work. If you enjoy R&B/soul then you might enjoy it. If you like Cat's early work, you will probably dislike this album. There's very few songs, and none of the songs stick out. I especially dislike the record-length-long ""Foreigner Suite"". It doesn't seem to go anywhere, and is filled with generic sounding instrumentals. This album doesn't sound like Cat Stevens, it sounds like something you'd hear in Old Navy."
3,good book,"this story is about jessi baby sitting for derek, a child star from stoneybrook who is on a break from filming a tv sitcom. She is so starstruck that she felt she wanted to get into acting and modeling and things like that, but it's good she stuck with what she knew best, ballet and she landed a role in a ballet after a couple auditions at a community centre in stoneybrook. I think it was for the nutcracker or something, I can't remember."
3,The book was good,I loved how Jessi handled Danielle. The book was good and I recommend it to everyone.
4,"Beaautifully illustrated-hypnotic,not boring. Bedtime magic!","This book is the perfect read for small children at bedtime.Even the beautiful and sweet (but not sappy or saccharine)illustrations convey the sense of the world going to sleep that is very soothing. Careful you don't fall asleep yourself!kids age 2-4 loved it. The rhymes are deceptively simple, but the perfect cadence to help kids relax for bed:""It's time for bed, Little goose, little goose,The stars are out and on the loose.""If the kids still aren't asleep at the end of the book, we made up our own rhymes for more animals going to sleep, reread the book, and it was guaranteed sleepy time.A wonderful bedtime story-definite winner."
5,A must have for every young library!!,"I love this book! I read it to my two young sons (ages 2 and 3) every night before bed. I have been reading it since they were born, and they are still excited everytime it is time to read it. Before bed they always say ""Don't forget the animal night night book"". It really helps to settle them down before it is time to sleep!! The pictures are beautiful, and my kids love the thought of all the little animals getting ready for bed right along with them!! I buy this everytime I need a gift for a child."
5,My 2 year old loves this book!,"Every night we read this book beofre my 2 year old goes to sleep, he then sleeps with it and brings it to me when he wakes up to read it again. It's simple so he's memorized it and he likes to laugh with it and see the mommy and baby animals."
5,"Beautifully illustrated, my children love this...",This book is the perfect lap size. The illustrations are just beautiful. Both of my children (under 3 years old) love this book. This is the perfect addition to any collection...
5,A soothing book,"Whenever my 8 month old daughter is a little crankie, all I have to say to her is ""It's time for bed little mouse little mouse"" and she calms right down. As I rock her to sleep each night I recite the book to her. Puts her out every time. I can't wait until she understands what the words and pictures mean."
5,"If the words don't get you, the illustrations will....","We bought this book for our baby girl when we were in Northern Wisconsin. The unbelievable illustrations are cartoonish enough to entertain small children but realistic enough to touch the Mommy or Daddy reading it. My personal favorite picture is that of the mice....how precious. It's a quick read, and yes, it's very repetitive. That's what soothes small children....?"
5,Best Bedtime Book!,"I adore this book and more importantly, my children do too. I give this book to everyone that has a baby! It is always a favorite. Mem fox is a splendid author. I have many of her books and will continue to grow my collection until my children have outgrown them. These will be books I will pass down to my grandchildren."
1,a disappointment,The book had been water damaged with pages stuck together. Unreadable. I was so disappointed as the pictures that could be seen were very pretty.
1,"Save Your Money, Skip this one.","My daughter got this book when she was two. I found it annoying that the book wasn't consistent. For example...a baby horse is called a foal, but a baby sheep is a sheep, not a lamb. With so many great books out there, I would skip this one."
5,Such a sweet book,My niece had this book and i bought a copy for my youngest daughter - i've also sent it as a baby gift - it's just a really sweet book. perfect for winding down a day...
5,Best Nightime book EVER!,This book is wonderful. The rhyming and phrasing is great for soothing little ones to sleep. We started reading this every night when I was about 6 months pregnant. The twins absolutely love it and are asleep before the last page. It makes for such a relaxing bedtime routine for kids and mom and dad. I recommend this book to everyone.
2,(Big Book Edition)? No Kidding!,"18"" x 18"" is rather large, and hard to hold. Even the box it came in is enormous, 18"" x 22"" x 10""! I don't recall seeing the actual size in the description, just the ""HUGE Book"" review mentioning that is indeed large. Unfortunately, they didn't point out the full dimensions. Good luck!"
5,GREAT bedtime story,"WONDERFUL BOOK! We read this to my infant every night. We started a few months ago and now hears it, and just KNOWS it's bedtime! The cadence of the story is great and its just the right length. By the time my husband reads the last sentence our 6 month old is asleep. =)"
4,"Beautiful illustrations, average text","The text is the typical rhyming couplet poetry that fills so many board books for the 1-3 crowd. It's not drivel, but it isn't especially enjoyable either. It's also a bit disappointing when one reads some of Fox's other books, like Harriet, You'll Drive Me Wild (written for a slightly older audience) and realises how capable she is.The illustrations, however, are phenomenal. There are beautiful, detailed images of various parent/child pairs. Fish and bees aren't known for being loving, involved parents, but most 2 and 3 year olds won't catch on to that. The still closed eyes of the baby squirrel and the downy feathers of the baby goose are very true to life.In terms of quality, it's a very well put together board book that should survive many readings and a fair bit of chewing and tossing."
3,so-so book,"I probably wouldn't suggest this to other parents, there are much better books out there. I like the little blue truck, the ant on the railroad track. Nicely written and fun to read for the parents.This book, i was getting bored reading it and I dislike some of the drawings.pros: The repetitiveness helps my daughter to read it with me and the ending is very nice, sweet and had the niceness picture of the whole book."
3,Time for Bed,"This was an appealing book for a small child, and for the mother trying to get the child ready for bed. The size is good--the child can be a little bit rough with it; also the size calls attention to it.However, the illustrations lack mastery. The artist chose difficult positions for the animals but didn't draw them convincingly."
4,A Must for Parents to Read to their Young Children!,"Time For Bed is a perfect bed time book for any child. Animals of all sorts are being put to bed by their loving mothers: little mouse, little goose, little cat, little foal, little fish, and even a little snake, and many more baby animals. Each baby animal is put to bed with a little rhyme, making it very easy for children who are reading the book themselves or are being read to, easy to understand and comprehend:""Good night little foal, I'll whisper a secret but don't tell a soul.""Jane Dyer's illustrations also show the love present in this picture book as each baby animal is cared for by their parent, showing such a connection to children reading this book. This book is perfect for any parent wanting to read a wonderful and endearing book to their children as they go to bed."
3,Incorrect animal names,"This is a sweet book and my three year-old grandson loves it. On most pages it calls the baby animal by the correct name: a foal, a calf, a pup...but on the other pages the baby is a sheep instead of a lamb, a cat instead of a kitten, a goose instead of a gosling. This inconsistency bugs me everytime I read it. I would suggest that you read it before you buy it."
3,not what I expected,My daughter is a Pre K student at LSU in Baton Rouge and looking forward to reading to children in her classroom. Mem Fox is her favorite teacher and we have given Ten Little Fingers as a gift before. I purchased all of your available Mem Fox board books as a Christmas surprise expecting each of them to be the same size. Nothing on your web page indicated that the books would be too small for classroom use. Pls consider listing size in your description.
5,Wonderful bedtime book,"We love this book. It flows wonderfully and it would be a perfect bedtime story, if only our daughter was not so excited to read it!"
5,"Great for Babies, too",My 10 month old son loves this book. It is one that we read every night. He already recognizes the different animals. The words are nice and soothing and help us wind-down before bed.
5,A Sweet Little Night-time Book,"""It't time for bed, little mouse, little mouse,Darkness if falling all over the house.""Gentle words and sweet drawings of little animal parents caring for their darlings have made this book a nightstand favorite in many, many homes and in ours as well. This book is so well suited for bedtime that all I can add to the other 79 persons who praised it (4 or more stars) is that Fox and Dyer are geniuses.""The stars on high are shining bright--Sweet dreams, my darling, sleep well...Good night."""
5,MUST HAVE!!!,"We received this book as a baby present and I have been reading it to my son ever since. He's now one year old and brings it to me every night to read to him, sometimes more than once. It features all kinds of different animals with beautiful drawings and has a wonderful, rhythmic verse for each of them. ""It's time for bed little mouse, little mouse. Darkness is falling all over the house."" I could recite the whole book by memory!Buy this book for your kids and for anyone else that has kids!"
3,It is OKAY but could be so much better...,"I read many reviews before buying this book...as an English teacher, I am picky about the books I get for my twin grandsons. My daughter has begun routinely reading the 18-month-old boys a book before bedtime, so I wanted to contribute a really good bedtime book. Many of the pages of this board book are good, but some of the bedtime scenes have pictures that are not very clear (the fish mom and the cat mom saying good nite to their babies are not very clear pictures...hard to distinguish at least one of the animals) and some of the animals are not very common for the boys to relate to them. Some of the scenes are quite beautiful..others not so much. Some of the captions were soothing and well-written. Others not so much. Sigh. Maybe I am just too picky..."
4,"Wonderful illustrations, but text does not do justice...","My 1 1/2 year old son LOVES this book. We always read it before bedtime, and at the end he says ""night night baby"" to the little girl. The pictures are gorgeous. My main complaint is that the text is really dumb -- not good rhymes, not clever at all."
4,Great guitar & inspirational,"I only have heard the cover tune, but it's got a great guitar solo, and the song is both inspiring as well as musically satisfying; has a great groove."
4,This edition/printing is seriously flawed,"An interesting work, reminding one of Flashman. Entertaining and educational.However, this edition/printing is seriously flawed. In no less than two copies I have purchased, the text stops at page 96, repeats pages 49--96, then skips ahead to page 145. Make sure that your copy does not have this prining error!Addenum: a email to the Publisher got me very prompt and excellent service. See this Publisher's superb list of Naval Fiction!"
5,Retro-tekno thriller,"The first of a quartet of novels about a submarinecommander and pilot in WWI. Exciting, with anireverant wit and strong sense of humanity."
3,Horrible Editing,"I have bought a great number of books from McBooks Press (Ramage, Kydd, Halfhyde, etc), but this is the first e-book. It won't be the last, but may be the next to last. Larry's description of the numerous capitalization errors on EVERY page is 100% correct. I'm no grammar nazi and you may find several errors in this critique, but then I'm not a professional editor nor asking anyone to pay $7.99 for such sloppy work. The reason this it a problem is because it becomes a big distraction to what otherwise is a fantastic story. Amazon needs to have this mess corrected and offer that version (for free) to those of us who expected a professional piece of work. It begs the question, how did this even happen? I'm positive the text edition is correct, and that was printed from a digital proof at some point. How stupid do you have to be to have a prefect verision and then screw it up?"
4,A Touching and Intelligent Story,"I have just recently watched this video and found it to be an absolute delight! While several people fuss about the play not covering enough about Turing's theories, one needs to realize that it is a piece about the man, not his theories. The film version is somewhat different from the play version, which I was disappointed by. However, the performances are superb, all around great cast, but it is Derek Jacobi who gives such subtle depth and tremendous passion to this film. I highly recommend it for anyone who enjoys seeing an intelligent, meaningful piece about humanity."
3,Father of the Computer,"Alan Turing was an English mathematical genius, pulled into WWII to break the cryptographic codes used by the Nazis. They used machines that could spin wheels and produce extremely complex codes nearly impossible to decipher. Turing conceived of a computer that could sort through endless combinations quickly and crack the codes, even though they were changed daily. However, he was caught in a gay affair with a male hustler and after prosecution, forced to take hormones as a ""treatment."" Although he saved countless lives and ships by cracking the codes, and invented the world's first working computer, persecution proved too much and he took his life in a most unusual way."
3,Double Entendre,"The world of cryptography is fascinating. So is the world of Derek Jacobi. It was a brilliant idea to offer a role of Alan Turing to Brother Cadfael. I set my heart to see a struggle of human intellect against the five rotating wheels. I wanted to see how a mind of a genius beats a U-Boat fleet. Unfortunately, instead of it, I've got another gay rights pamphlet. A point that no one should be punished for victimless crimes done in privacy is a very simple one, but not profound enough to keep viewer entertained for two hours."
5,Great Bon Scott recording!,"If you enjoy Bon Scott, this CD is a must have. It's bluesy sound is unlike any of the other Scott Cds, and the boys really turn it up musically. Jailbreak, Soul Stripper, and Baby Please Don't Go are as good as rock gets!"
4,JAILBREAK!!,"This was my second album my dad bought for me when it first came out (in the Reissue form back in 2003)i was 12 then(14 now)This was when i really started to like AC/DC and after i got BACK IN BLACK,they were my favorite band.This album may only have 5 songs but hey,its AC/DC!Pink floyds Wish you were Here only had five songs so stop whining!!These songs are great because im a guitar player and they're fun to play along to long solos so you can really jam.The best songs have to be Jailbreak,and Soul Stripper,because they're two of AC/DC's great song list(and they have a long list!)Brian does a great job of singing Jailbreak and i think hes better at singing it than Bon was,(i think brian is better)So go out and buy it,its worth the money."
5,2 few,"soul stripper, i wore that song out, when i was a kid, i just loved it!the only thing bad about this album is that it is TOOOOOOO SHORT!!!!!!!! i know, it is just a EP, but still"
1,What a JOKE,"5 songs? This is completely ridiculous. I don't care if they were the 5 greatest songs ever recorded, it's still a big rip off. Shame on you, Angus."
4,"Good, But Somewhat Incomplete","This is a good album, but I can't see giving it 5 stars. I mean, the title track is possibly the best song they ever did with Bon at the helm, but that's really the only great song on here. None of the rest are bad by any means, but they're not classic either. The cover of Baby Please Don't God is quite good though, as is Soul Stripper. I guess I like this album more than I think I do.However, it is short, and they should've added more songs to it during the remastering process. Despite this album and Volts from Bonfire there are still a handful of AC/DC tracks that have yet to be released in America. This shouldn't be! All in all, this is a worthy album though, because of the title track, and because it's generally cheaper than their other cds."
2,In desperate need of an overhaul,"I really can't see how Atlantic records can justify selling this for the same price as ""Dirty Deeds,"" ""High Voltage,"" ""Powerage,"" or ""Let There Be Rock,"" especially in the age of the archival CD release. It's WAY too short, especially when you consider all of the unreleased-in-the-US songs from the Bon Scott era that could have been added to flesh this out. How about the early pre-Bon single ""Can I Sit Next To You Girl/Rockin' In The Parlor?"" Live tracks, anything! Make it worth the money! Look at what an excellent job MCA did with the Who's ""Odds & Sods"" reissue, or Columbia did with the Clash's ""Super Black Market Clash."" Don't misunderstand...the music's great, but the package [stinks]. AC/DC's fans should be treated with a little more respect than this."
3,Not enough songs!!!!!,"This is a good cd but they should have made it better. A new fan of Bon-Era AC/DC don't realize how many more great songs there are. This should have been the track list:1. Jailbreak2. You Ain't Got A Hold On Me3. Show Business4. Soul Stripper5. Baby, Please Don't Go6. Rock In Peace *7. Crabsody In Blue*8. School Days*9. Carry Me Home*10. Love Song*11. Stick Around*12. Cold Hearted Man*13. Fling Thing*If you are a fan of bon scott era acdc then get the songs that are asterisked via bootleg or jut download them its well worth it"
2,Good but quite short.,"The title track is great. It is my favorite Bon Scott song after Rosie, Dirty Deeds, and Highway To Hell. For those of you looking to get started on the thunder~get AC/DC Live. Jailbreak should be the last album you buy from them. They are my favorite band. Look for a new release in January."
3,Good...but not one of our favorites,"This was a a nice effort to tell a nature story with humor. However, my kids watched it a few times and then never asked for it again. If you are looking for fun nature videos for your children, I would first recommend National Geographic's other excellent videos such as Cain the Coyote (from this same series) or one of the Really Wild Animals series, such as Wonders Down Under."
4,Klein journeyman,Use this journeyman all the time when I have to install copper wire In a router cabinet cuts like butter. The grip is nice to handle and less stress on your hand when cutting through bunch of cables. Highly recommend.
1,Patti Smith Fans Beware,"As a Patti Smith fan for years I was very excited to see this video tape. Once I actually had the tape in my VCR, however, I was very disappointed. This tape centers on Ivan Kral. There is a little footage of interviews with Patti talking about Ivan Kral. There are some very short clips of the PSG in action. There are interviews with folks like Chris Stein and Debbie Harry and some of the Talking Heads commenting on the PSG.That is it, no songs in their entirety, no lengthy interview with Patti.If you are an Ivan Kral fan it's a great investment. If you want Patti Smith DO NOT purchase this tape. You will be very disappointed. Once you have seen the video it becomes very obvious that the title of the tape is deliberate in order to generate sales for the item."
5,Great SF!!,"I have a habit of reading the last book in a triology - first. Despite doing so, Bova's novel is a fantastic read. Though I didn't have all the backstory, I was still able to enjoy it. The main character, Pancho, was well-defined and very real. Humphries is the guy you love to hate. Arrogant, egotiscal and devious. Lars, gotta love the guy and admire his devotion to his wife and the reader definitely feels the hate he has for Humphries. Bova, successfully entwined raw emotion into each of his characters, making them a reality in the mind's eye. As with other Bova novels, I don't expect to be disappointed reading the first two within this series."
2,more action than sci-fi,"this book was pretty disappointing. on the back cover some comments seem to compare him to the likes of asimov, but after reading this book, let me say that he does not remotely touch the works of asimov. this books feels like a big-budget hollywood sci-fi movie. there really isn't a good underlying theme from the story, there's a lot of action, sex, some violence, and lots of cliche. there was a decent build up of the story in the first half that was pretty exciting, but then it lets down w/ the resolution. the background description was pretty intriguing and decently set up. at the end he does kind of insert some commentary, but all in all instead of being a good sci-fi, this book feels a bit cheap and trashy. hopefully this is not representative of his other works"
4,Engaging look into the next 100 years in space,Commercial motives; Human nature; Creative thinking; This story combines the three for a caricatured look at what the next 100 years in space may be like. Engagingly told in the down-to-earth style the author does well. I had not read the other trilogy books but that was not an impediment. This book is more about people in a future than the future.
5,Very good,anytime coffee! The acidity and finish is wonderful. It is a pleasant start to a morning. I drink Coffee masters exclusively and would stock up on this again. A excellent coffee to offer to friends and guests.
4,Some can't Hackett,"This is a great album. Like many great albums it's eclectic. It's like a collection of short stories, or poems or images. This is an artist collaborating with other artists, at the height of their collective creative powers. Layered with his trademark guitar sounds Steve experiments with atmospheres. It's not typical pop or rock. This is progressive. It moves on. It challenges. Something here will grab you. For the lovelorn, you'll be lucky to find better than ""hoping love will last""."
4,Getting better with age,"I know this cd almost since it went out, this one goes better with age.I remember that many songs didn't caught my attention when I was younger and now, they are among my favorite of the album. I like all songs on this cd with a special mention for the voice of Steve Walsh which give a special emotion to the songs he sings."
3,Fiddled formula,"A respectable turn for the worse, the solid set of manufactured music only serves to enunciate instrumental dominance in the few tracks where composing arrangements outweigh serving a voice or unwarranted segue."
2,Hackett loses magic touch on second album.,"Granted, Voyage Of The Acolyte was a hard act to follow - this weak follow-up is evidence of that. But to replace the mystery and lushness of that classic album with...Steve Walsh? His overbearing vocals are tough enough to sit through on a Kansas album, let alone here. Richie Havens is an odd pick for vocals, too, but I guess anybody's better than Hackett himself. Still, this album's worth checking out for brother John Hackett's beautiful flute work throughout and Randy Crawford's belt-it-out vocal on Knowing Love Will Last. It wouldn't be until the following Spectral Mornings and Defector LPs, however, that Hackett would regain his true form."
4,Great quality for the price,"Narrow field of view and hard to hold still.Not good for watching birds, but I knew that when we bought them."
2,Flimsy,Had to place extra supports inside so it didn't lean. It is very nice looking when you get it to stand up straight.
3,Not worth it,"I am a huge fan of Steve Hackett and I was very excited when this live album was first released. Although it is a great selection of his works, and is very representative of his style and playing abilities, the problem is that he plays almost every song ""straight,"" i.e. just as it was recorded in the original studio version. Except for ""Camino Royale"" and maybe a couple of other tracks, each song is played practically ""note for note,"" with very little variation. This is disappointing because the reason many of us buy live recordings is to hear the difference from the studio versions. It's also somewhat disappointing that this is a ""selection"" of live tunes taken from different concerts. I would have rather heard one, continuous, uninterrupted concert, rather than tunes which were ""selected"" just because of their ""polished"" nature. I would recommend almost any of Steve Hackett's other recordings over this one."
1,Buy the Tribute Instead,"Same package available on the Chrome Dreams label. One CD is a boring reading of an encyclopedia version of Woody's life. The other CD is 52 of Woody's cuts in bad sound. A better intro to his life is Tribute to Woody Guthrie on Warner Brothers, at a good price at Amazon. Professional actors and top folk singers mix readings and songs to make the story come alive."
2,"Someone should have sent out an S.O.S., because the S.O.S. Band is really in trouble here","A group responsible for some of the best R&B of the 80s, The S.O.S. Band attempted to carry their career into the next decade with this album, and from listening to this, it quickly becomes clear that they shouldn't have. Unquestionably the weakest album of their career, nothing on here even makes a passable substitute for such classics as ""The Finest"", ""Weekend Girl"", ""Take Your Time (Do It Right)"", ""Tell Me If You Still Care"", or ""Nothing But The Best"". And, no matter how successful rapper Kurupt has become over the years, this was so not a good place for him to make his initial appearance. The S.O.S. Band is definitely not a rapper-friendly group, and even the greatest rappers would probably sound very out of place alongside it."
4,Environmental thriller -- great read,"The author is a first rate ecologist --so you not only learn a great deal first hand about Africa and its land and people -- but this is also a great thriller. The characters are fun, the action is exciting, plot is great, the setting is intriguing and you learn a lot about living and travelling in Afria along the way. I read this on a trip. It took me a bit to get into it, but then I was hooked by the characters and their lives, and I ended up staying up much too late to find out the ending to the adventure, and woke up groggy, but happy. Get this book and getentertained."
1,Unplayable,This product its unplayable on any DVD Player that I have. Hate that Amazon didnt make the proper disclaimer...
3,"Great girl, great pictures - what about the sound?","I think everyone has said what there is to say about this awesome show. Anastacia rocks. The live versions of songs are barely recognisable - and that is GOOD! I am lucky in that I am in a PAL coutry, so compatibility isn't an issue. (Though I find it strange that the US doesn't sell gear that is compatible with PAL countries, as all the TVs and layers in PAL countries will play NTSC as well.My beef is that is it only Dolby Stereo (although it is a good mix). Why have such a great video production and not make the sound 5.1, both Dolby and DTS?"
4,Anastacia at Last!,"Anastacia's long awaited DVD was finally released and surpassed my expectations! It is unimaginable how this talented singer-songwriter has not gained popularity in the U.S. yet is considered to be the biggest female artist in the world and is originally from New York! Both her stage voice and presence are demanding and her dedication to and appreciation of her fans, unwavering. The only drawback to this DVD is that it is formatted in Region 2, common in Europe. Most of the newer DVD players here can adapt to it, however, mine is a few years old and will not play the disc. I had to watch it on my laptop. Other than that, this is definitely worth owning!!!"
3,Pink Lady and Jeff,"This is a ""dream-come-true"" item for all of the Pink Lady fans especially in Japan, since they could not watch this program when it was running only in the U.S. back in 1980. Although neither of Mie and Kei, the members of Pink Lady, spoke fluent English back then, you would be amazed to actually see these two young ladies, who were only in their early 20's, to have their own prime-time tv program in the U.S."
3,Story in Clay,"If Holland could paint, then may be he would have a self portrait in paint on the back of this book - but I am glad that he chose to put it in a poem. Quite an idea!'Anasazi Women' is a beautiful poem about a tribe, their lifestyle told not only from the pots they left but also from their arthritic skeletal ruins.I could not relate to the rest of the poems in the collection."
3,Not a good option,"The music rates 5 stars but the song selection is not so good. Just do yourself a favor and get Power Pop, Volumes 1 and 2. Just buy those two CDs here and you have ALL four Raspberries albums. Pretty simple."
1,wrong CD in case,I ordered the CD twice and both times received the wrong CD in the the right case. Thw wrong CD was Propaganda so I can't rate the CD I ordered.
1,still never received cd,i have sent this product back twice now because they sent the wrong cd and have still not received it or gotten my money back....horrible
3,over-ly wordy; get pH before this to 'get' p. hamill's solo work,"i argue this is a tiresome production. agnst and anguish over a failed love is only interesting if the separation of a parallel creative thrust accompanies the theme. a soothing sentimentality or bringing in other love interests would justify such deep mourning, but to deluge the listener with lyrical mass saturated with pathos is almost subconsciously sadistic as a modal choice. >>>>i sympathize with the intent to emphasize the pain, but poetry has an uphill challenge already competing with formats such as tv or instrumental music that an injustice to lyrical effort in general is risked as a result. i have such respect for the effective humane accomplishment of hamill's album pH that i can overlook the comparative bathos of this release. i hope the listeners committed to discovery of rock lyrical gems will try some of peter's other solo albums first before this dull but heart-felt item."
5,Bay Area Hip-hop Represented to the FULLEST!,"None of that whack ""smoke 'em shoot'em up"" gangster wanna-be nonsense here. This compilation truly represents what Bay Area hip-hop is all about: relevant, intelligent rhymes delivered with style and intent. Did i mention the dope beats on every track? This one is definitely a listen straight through to the end again and again kinda album."
4,YEAH AREA IN YO TOWN,"Yo, now you realize the depth of the bay. We've heard enough about NY or anywhere else for that matter. And what your blind eyes can't see is the biggest and best artist come out of Oakland other parts of the bay. These are real Oakland artists yo. You know what I want to say but..This compilation for those of you from everywhere else but the place to B- is a mix of most of the best underground hip hiznop artists right now. Among the is Mystic, acid jazzy ghetto rap, universal. The Coup, issac hayes,real oakland style/ there own.

1,A complete waste of money...,"I can't believe that she managed to get someone to publish this ""book"" (I use the term loosely). There is almost no useful content at all. This is, very clearly, a case where if you were in a brick-and-mortar bookstore, and you picked up this book to have a lookie, in half a nanosecond you would immediately return it to the shelf... (sorry Amazon!)"
1,"Who wrote the favorable reviews, the author's parents?",This book is a complete waste of time and money. The outdated ideas are completely out of place in a contemporary classroom. I am sorry that I didn't read the customer reviews before I ordered this title. The suggestions in this book are so bad that I plan to use them in my next new teacher staff development training as examples of what not to do.
1,Waste of Money,This book was a huge disappointment. It was extremely quick reading and offered no substance! I will be returning this book!
1,Don't waste your time,"Please don't buy this book! It won't help you become a better substitute teacher. There are too many pages devoted to knock-knock jokes and silly riddles. The author also has way too much to say about using videos!... Most school districts won't let you use videos that have not been approved or reviewed by the district and/or principal, yet she has you bringing in your own tapes.I was VERY disappointed with the lack of help I received from this book."
1,Lofty words don't feed the hungry.,"I'm sorry to report this book is indeed too simplistic for the substitute teacher who needs meat in order to survive the jungle. It is sweet and uplifting, but the only thing I gained from reading this book is one joke to share with kids."
2,Book is too simplistic for anyone who has substitut taught.,"Mrs. Gaither is a very nice person and I'm sure a talented teacher. I am disappointed in the book only because I probably expected too much from the title, it doesn't do anything unless the target reader has spent NO time in the classroom and has not had ANY training at all. It would have been better to title this book: ...FOR THE BRAND NEW SUBSTITUTE AND BRAND NEW TEACHER."
1,a let down,"I purchased this book in hopes to gather wonderful and practical information for my first sub job, what a let down. I found this book lacking in so much information that it should only be considered as reading material at a quick glance (much like a magazine article). I will be returning it."
4,Not quite to size,"I'm not a big girl, but I ordered the large of this costume so I had some room to not feel shoved in it while partying for halloween. I tried it on after it arrived,lo and behold not quite a good fit. The waste fits fine, arm bands fit fine. The top part where the zipper comes up, is TIGHT. I'm not large (a 38C), and I had to exhale all my air, and try to collapse my rib cage to get the zipper to go all the way up. My husband had to pull the ends together to get the clasp at the top to snap, and more pulling to get the zipper to go up. Once up, it was OK. I'm not about to inhale a huge breath and bend over or anything, cause it will burst. But for walking around the party, it will do fine.So, warning. If you have big boobs or a chest bigger then 38C, you better get the XL.And pull the snakes head dress out and air it out (along with the costume). The thing smells horribly of rubber and plastic. OK once it has airred out."
3,conversation piece,"I wore this last Halloween to a couple of parties. Got a lot of attention. It is a beautiful, dramatic costume. The back zipper was a problem, it kept opening in the back. I don't know if this was a common defect, of just particular to mine. I really enjoyed wearing it, except for the zipper."
5,Magnificent book to understand Digital Electronics !,"This is the best book to understand Digital Electronics with clear and simple explanations. The salient feature of this book is that it has lot of applications sprayed throughout which keeps the reader attentive and interested. A ""Must Read"" for graduate/undergraduate students in any university in the world."
5,Best of its kind,"I used this book for a course on Digital Electronics. Its great. The book has a great typeset, clear and crisp fonts that go easy on the eyes, well structured (such that you read what you need in order to understand the next chapter). The book is illustrated with apt diagrams. I would consider this book to be beginner-intermediate. This book is a good starting point for learn digital stuff, and a good reference after you learn digital stuff. Its hard to find a book as good as this one."
4,Sweet Teaching for Tender Hearts,"What about Heaven is a sweet little book written by Kathleen Bostram and illustrated by Elana Kucharik, illustrator of Care Bears. The author gives a simple directive to how we get to heaven and what we will be doing when we arrive there. This is a cute first book to begin leading your children to the only way to heaven, Jesus Christ.As soon as I got this book out of the package from the publisher, my five year old ran off with it. She had read it several times by the time I found her and had her read it to me. She thought the drawings were adorable and liked the rhyming text. I agreed with her. It is a great addition to any pre-school library."
5,Wonderful view of heaven for little ones :),"This past year my brother past, and a few weeks later, a co-worker had a family member pass. We both have young children, 5 and 6 yrs of age. I am very picky when it comes to books for my child as she is with her daughter. I didn't want anything to discourage them even more then they already were. I came across this book, and I am so glad I did. It turned my son's frown upside down and for once, he seemed to show a little piece of heaven in his face. He wasn't too upset after reading the book, since it took a positive and uplifting approach. It not once talked about death, which I loved. I just talked about a wonderful place that wonderful people move to! Love it and will keep it until I am able to pass it down, many years later so it can help someone else. :)"
4,Nice tool,"Nice tool for what it is, have yet to use it, will work fine for the application I intend on using it for."
1,Cute does not equal good,"These are cute rain boots but that's where the good things end. These offer no support and are very uncomfortable for wearing for any length of time. And after just a few weeks of wear they split on the top. I got mine at Target for about $20. So really what did I expect for the price? But the prices I'm seeing online for these cheap boots are outrageous. Stay away from the ""Chooka"" boots and spring for something of higher quality even if they're not at cute."
2,Torture devices!,"These boots are very cute and have a nice wide shaft for girls with bigger calves like me. HOWEVER, they are horribly uncomfortable. If I walked more than 3 blocks in them I got cramps in my feet that drove me to find the nearest spot to sit down and rip them off. I cannot figure out what it is that causes the horrible pain, as when I put them on and stand there or just pace around a room, they feel pretty good.Whoever designed these boots hates feet and wants to see them die."
4,"Good quality, sizes run big.","These boots are very heavy, and sturdily made, good for working outside and gardening in. The sizes run very very big though, so order a size or two small if you want them to fit snug! They do have a smell when you first get them, but it's just the smell of the natural rubber. No big deal."
3,"Cute, roomy and good while they lasted...","Having owned several different brands of rain boots, I would have to say I would only buy this Chooka brand for the looks. They look great, and received lots of compliments, I work in a wet environment so I wear them everyday. They help me go out of the monotony with the designs and colors, but they crack on stress points (specially side of your big toe). Maybe if I just used them for walking they would have last longer but still would have eventually cracked sooner rather than later. I would stick with the Kamik brand similarly priced and they still are good to go after couple years! For extra-durable rainboots Xtra-tuff brand still winner hands down, but are more pricey...If buying Chooka brand buy a size smaller unless you plan on wearing extra thick socks.PROS: Great looksCONS: Short lived"
2,Short Lived Romance,"V. cute but after less than a year of usage there were splits all over the place. Up the spine of each boot, in the sole of the right foot at the toe seam in the left foot. I know that I shouldn't expect shoes to last forever but for the price I would expect these to last at least 2 yrs before deteriorating. Consumerism culture where companies see how short something can last but keep the customer returning: I will not be returning. I've been shopping around though for my next paid and it seems that this is a common problem with all rain boots -- I guess the material isn't very durable. I would love to know if there's anything I can do to lengthen the life of the boots."
5,I love these!,"I love these boots. They are as comfortable as rain boots can be, and very durable. I have had no problems with mine and I've owned mine for over 6 months now. I usually wear a 7 1/2 or 8 and got a size 8 and it fits great. These do have a slight rubber smell just like any other rain boots."
3,Big and clunky,"Order a size down for these boots! I am usually a 9.5 to a 10 and the 9 was even a tiny bit big. These boots are NOT for walking - they offer little support. If you need rain boots, just get the ugly kind that actually feel decent on your feet. The patterns are cute, but these boots just aren't worth the money to look cute. Plus, they're really wide in the calf area."
2,What happened?,"I have gotten a ton of compliments when I wear the boots and they worked really well. They seemed to be good quality...alittle on the heavy side; so I was completely suprised one day...after wearing them modestly over a 5 month period (only when it rained)the rubber on the side of the boot split. I was really disappointed with it because the rain boots I had before this pair lasted me 2 years(Sam and Libby). Personally, I'm calling it quits for this brand."
1,Agreed--another EXTREMELY short lived review,"Lasted maybe 3 months with 2X a week wear. Split right along the side of the foot, rendering them rather useless for wet weather. What a complete waste. Get some real wellies."
2,Inapplicable,This book would be a disappointment to any little boy who does not have a sister. All the mean tricks one must not do are to a sister. Grandson Rowan wasn't interested. He yawned. That was a bad sign.
3,Good Product but no instructions for accessories,"This is a good product and a time saver. However, there are no instructions for using some of the accessories i.e. the shredders and graters. It would be helpful to have more recipes, too. But, the lack of instructions for safely using some of the accessories hinders me from saying that this a great product.I nicked a fingernail trying to use the large shredder. A bit scary since my nails are short and my finger would have been next. The blades are as sharp as they say."
5,Diamond in the rough,"Often overlooked, this may be the best AC/DC album next to Back in Black. Maybe because it was released with little fanfare right when Disco was peaking and punk was emerging, this album didnt sell. But hey, this strongly blues influenced winner can be our little secret....."
4,What a Scorcher!,"I have gradually accumulated all of AC/DC's discs, and Powerage was one of the last ones I bought. That was my loss, because it has jumped to the front of the line in terms of favorite hard rock cds. Malcolm and Angus come up with some of their best riffs ever, and Bon Scott is terrific. What I like most is the bluesiness of the tunes: ""Down Payment Blues"" is one of the best songs these boys have ever recorded. ""Riff Raff"" absolutely smokes. The production is excellent, featuring a stripped-down, no-frills guitar attack. Angus' solos are marvels of minimalism. This album is a definite peak in the band's long career. Sure, Highway to Hell is a great disc, but in many ways, Powerage is even stronger. In my opinion, this is the one AC/DC disc to own from the Bon Scott era."
4,It's a song missing on it!,"This is one of the best albums that AC/DC has made it's very close to be as good as Highway to hell. But ther is a song missing on the cd that is on my winyl record and I think the record company made a big mistake when they excluded the best song on the album, namely ""Cold harted man"""
4,"Rock music lover, new to AC DC loves this album!!!","I only hold back one star because I haven't heard many of their more popular releases. As a huge Zeppelin and Pink Floyd fan I find the songs on Powerage to be delightfully HARD!!! Where has AC/DC been all of my life??? THIS is why I listen to rock music, for drums, guitars and music that shakes me to the core! I have to disagree with some of the earlier posts and say that this is a great way to plunge into AC/DC! Granted, I am older and already love a large variety of rock music. The fact that these songs were all new and fresh to me was a plus. My personal favorites here are 'Gimme a Bullet' and 'Up to My Neck in You'."
5,Very Underrated,"I myself an enormous AC/DC fan did not know about this album until I was searching in the music store for AC/DC albums I didn't have. Of course you always see Back in Black, Highway To Hell, and High Voltage but this album was new to me for some reason. I already knew Riff Raff and Sin City but I bought this album and I was amazed. To think there was another great Bon album I didn't have just shocked me. I enjoyed this album a lot but I wouldn't go far enough to say it was the best AC/DC album because it really isn't but I will say it was worth the money and I'm very happy it's in my collection rather than sitting forgotten on a shelf until another person discovered it. If you want Powerage you might need to order it online because not every store has a copy."
5,best,"In my opinion, this is the best of the Bon Scott albums. Actually this is my second favorite ac/dc album after Back in Black. Not only are there great riffs, killer vocals, and thumping basslines, but this album best reflects what ac/dc is: a pumped-up, amplified blues band. Best reflected in ""Down Payment Blues,"" ""Kicked in the Teeth,"" and ""Up To My Neck in You,"" this album just oozes dirty blues riffs. Surprisingly, it also has more radio friendly fare such as the fantastic ""What's Next to the Moon,"" and ""Gone Shooting,"" two songs that don't focus so much on the traditional power chords, but rather on the voice of Scott and the subtle backing guitiar of Malcom Young. Highly recommended for Scott era AC/DC fans."
5,And its a Rock N' Roll Damnation,"CRIMINALLY, underrated...I can't even explain, every song on here, is great, great performance from Bon as well, but he was always great, but this is one of his best, buy this album"
3,"Nitty gritty, rockin-it-to-the-core, raw, early AC/DC..","""Got myself a cadillac.. but I can't afford the gasoline..."" What irony! What wit! What an amazingly brilliant piece of musical ingenuity and craftsmanship! What talent! What unbelievable ability to be able to play 3 chords in various combinations and tempos throughout this album! I love it! Bon, we miss you buddy!!!!!!"
2,Not one of their best,I like the band but this is not one of their best and it makes it so typical at times of trying to differentiate their albums and find what comes next
4,Powerage,"No, Bon Jovie needs hundred of years, and milion of issues to evencome close to something like AC/DC, if he even can make it, I meanto come close. It's true, even a average AC/DC isa eloquent lesson in fundamental rock'n roll and even if this isn'tone of their gems, it still blows most opposition away whit great songsand Scott lyrics such as Riff Raff, Sin City, Rock'n roll damnation andsuprises such as What is next to the moon,Gimme a bullet and Gone shoting.If you really want to be blown away, buy the live album If you want blood..but this is well worth to buy also. Buy it NOW!"
5,STRONG!!,"Outside of Back in Black and the new Black Ice, this is as good as it gets if you are a AC/DC fan."
4,KILLER ALBUM,"This album tends to be a little overlooked as far as AC/DC albums go. For a start it is one of the hardest sounding albums the band has ever come up with. It has many highlights, including one of the bands best songs in SIN CITY. The guitar section in the middle of this track is incredible. Other great tracks are ROCK 'N' ROLL DAMNATION, WHAT' NEXT TO THE MOON, DOWN PAYMENT BLUES & a few others. This is one of their best featuring the great BON SCOTT."
2,2 1/2 Stars,"""Powerage"" is the weakest of the band's early records...coming on the heels of the excellent ""Let There Be Rock"", maybe they were a little tapped out.A large part of the disc is unmemorable with only ""R'N'R Damnation"", the hilariously great ""Down Payment Blues"", ""Riff Raff"" and ""Sin City"" making any impression at all. The rest of the material isn't terrible by any means, just forgettable.For hardcore fans only."
1,Great guitarist but...,"Okay, the songs on this collection fairly rock and Andy McCoy is a fine guitarist and writer. However, you only have to listen to a few tracks before you start to fully appreciate Michael Monroe's Hanoi Rocks vocal stylings.The fact of the matter is, Andy McCoy CANNOT SING!Not a note.Vocal rubbish. Take a pass on this one and invest in Hanoi Rocks albums. You'll be the better for it."
5,Perfect introduction to macroeconomics for students,"Upon starting to read the book, I hardly knew how to spell the title: 'Macroeconomics'. It is a perfect introduction to what is called macroeconomics. If only 50 % of the teachers were half as good as Mankiw in presenting their matter, studying would be much more fun ... sure, and much more beneficial. From the didactical point of view, it is one of the best books I ever have hold in my hands."
5,Camco Aluminum Drain Pan,"I bought 2 plastic pans prior to buying this one, and wish I'd just started with the aluminum. It holds up well where the others cracked almost instantly. I am still using this pan and highly recommend it."
1,it as in bad shape,"I e-mail them, and they said that to let the UPS look at it , so we left on the deck for two weeks, and nothing . The pan look like it was step on and flating, and no more e-mails."
4,Better than the last 3 Cd's,"Blackie continues his political fascination with yet another negative outlook on America and it's political agenda. I can remember a time when rock n roll was about women, sex, and just having a good time. Blackie has been all doom and gloom on the last 3 discs. However, I have been a fan since the beginning and I still shell out my $15 for each new CD. This one was worth the extra cash, (since it was an import) The songs are better than his previous efforts and I am happy with the songs albeit the list is short. It just would be cool if Blackie let loose one more time!"
3,3.5 stars,Another nice album by Wasp. Its not a masterpiece but its a nice album. The production i think is better than previous works. Most of the songs are good (especially the first songs ) and my favorite is Heavens hung in black which is a great metal ballad. The last songs are not so good but this happens in most albums. Its a must for Wasp fans and a good album to buy general for metal fans.
1,A quick concoction of simple data,"I was very disappointed in this volume. There is little real data here or in-depth illustrations. You are much better off getting some of the books indicated in the bibliography, though I'm surprised it does not mention 'Sunburst' by Mark Peattie, the Japanese Naval Air Arm companion to 'Kaigun' by Evans and Peattie. You would be much better off just going to the combinedfleet.com website and printing up the unit histories and operational descriptions. A number of Japanese sources that are readily available have much more detail. Perhaps it would have been better to just translate them into English. Unfortunately, a poor effort."
3,"good history, light on reference photos/images","The book has comprehensive histories, but lacks reference photos/images - do not purchase this as a reference for modeling."
4,Imperial Japanese Navy Aircraft Carriers 1921-1945,"Excellent book! Good detail with regard to the ships, but lacking details regarding the aircraft that was on said ships. Again, the charts, maps, etc. used are too small and difficult to read. If you are doing any type of research on this subject matter, specifically the ships, this book is worth the price and I am glad I bought it."
4,"good read,good price.","If you want to know how many bolts and welds were used to build these ships,this book is not for you.But if your looking for a good overall picture of Japanese carriers in the second world war,this is it."
5,Warship History,The book is fantastic. It has an excellent history of all the classes and many artful illustrations that show the wartime views of the various aircraft carriers. It is well worth the purchase price.
3,IJN Aircraft Carriers,"This is a very thin book. with only a couple pictures of each carrier. The Illustrations were good, but no diagrams and not much visuals of any hangar decks. This is great for kids, but not anyone looking for modeling resources."
1,A bit thin on...,"Reading this pamphlet is one way to spend 20 minutes. However your 20 minutes would be better spent searching online for a book with a bit more ""meat"" on Japanese carriers."
2,Great topic; most disappointing book,"This is a wonderful topic. The Japanese built powerful warships - but with a different and fascinating perspective and appearance than the Western Powers. Unfortunately this book is a pamphlet: 75 or so pages, many pictures (good) but the accompanying description is merely a few paragraphs per ship - only a little more than a reader of the Pacific theatre would already know. Size of the book is also a detriment - thin; larger (height/ width) than a usual hardbound, much smaller than an illustrated book. Disappointingly, every time I see this book, the word ""cheap"" comes to mind. Sorry, go back and do a more comprehensive work on this and present it in a manner to be proud of."
2,Interesting but...,"Cross-country downhill and other Nordic mountain skiing techniques is an bold idea for its time. Today where nordic ski racer regularly exceed 50 mph on racing skis or we have extreme telemark films, the book is dated. Good historical reference."
5,Claudia's not sure she wants to find out who's calling.,"Kristy, Claudia, Mary Anne, and Stacey have had some strange adventures since they started the Baby-sitters Club. But nothing's been as spooky as what's going on right now. The baby-sitters have been getting mysterious phone calls when they're out on their jobs. When a phone rings and they pick up, there's no one on the other end of the line. Claudia's sure it's the Phantom Caller, a jewel thief who's been operating in the area. Claudia has always liked reading mysteries, but she doesn't like it when they happen to her. So she and the baby-sitters decide to take action- with some very mixed results!"
1,Hmm...,"This book was, well I won't say it was good. Because it wasn't. The BSC got some prank phone calls...ever heard of Caller ID or *69? I mean, come on! Besides, they should've just called the police first or their parents. They shouldn't have been keeping secrets like that. If it really was the Phantom Phone Caller, then they could get hurt or even killed if they were only in on it with each other. And so what if their parents wouldn't want them to sit until he was caught? I wouldn't want to sit myself if a criminal was on the loose! Think about it. Do you really want to waste your money on this book? Get it at the library before you buy it, I advise you. That way you'll know what you're buying before you buy it. Spend you $$ wisely for this book; I don't think you'd like it. But maybe you will? Just try it out for yourself. This book was a big yawn. No offense, Martin, but you really could've done better--a LOT better."
3,liked it,"The baby sitters are getting hang up calls and are worried about the patterns cause recently there was a thief doing that and then breaking into homes, but it's really alan gray and claudia's crush trevor who were imitating the latest stoneybrook scandal, and who had gotten a hold of the baby sitters record book doign that to the baby sitters cause they wanted to ask them to the halloween dance! The book is scary with the way it's written but once you know who is behind it all it all seems way too funny!"
4,somewhat exciting,"i have always loved the bsc and this book@was no exception. i thought the girls got a little carried away with the whole phantom caller thingie, but hey, thyre supposed to be young right? i was particularly amused with the stupid code they made up about a red ribbon. i actually laughed outloud. the ending was pretty funny too. youll read this book in one sitting!"
5,GREAT GIFT,I grew up reading The Baby-Sitters Club and decided to give my 10y/o niece the series as a Christmas present. I started out with only a couple of books to make sure she would like it and by early January she was asking for more. I think all young ladies would like this series.
4,Courtesy of Teens Read Too,"Things are starting to go well for The Baby-Sitters Club. They're getting a fair amount of babysitting jobs and the business is paying off not only for them, but the adults who hire them, as well.When the Phantom Caller, a jewel thief who calls and hangs up, then robs the house he just called, is reported in the area, the babysitters are uneasy. Their fear, however, grows worse when they start receiving hang-up calls on the job.Is it the Phantom Caller or a prank caller? Whatever it is, the babysitters are on the case and are determined to protect the kids they watch.One of the more unique books in THE BABY-SITTERS CLUB series, readers will enjoy the mix of humor, mystery, and friendship. The characters are better and even more memorable than they were in the first book, and their new challenges keep the book interesting.Readers who like realistic fiction will enjoy reading CLAUDIA AND THE PHANTOM PHONE CALLS.Reviewed by: Kira M"
3,Rather weak and off-course,"After a number of great early albums by Steve Hackett, we come to the album Cured. Gone is the six-piece band that brought us Spectral Mornings and Defector. In it's place is just Steve, keyboardist Nick Magnus, and a drum machine. Brother John Hackett does appear a little on flute, but it's very marginal.The big problems with this album is the drum machine (which sounds cheesy to the trained ear), and the lack of strong songs. In fact, most of the songs are in the pop music category. With the new direction, and with Steve starting to get used to handling the vocals, the result is a weak effort. Based on the rest of the albums Steve has put out, I'd think that he'd cringe and be embarrased by this one.There are a few decent songs on the album, like the somewhat dark and menacing Air Conditioned Nightmare, and the quiet acoustic Cradle of Swans, but the rest are a bit annoying."
1,Terrible quality printing- not recommended,"The book as shown on the listing,i.e the large size format etc. implies there are some great maps. The title ""the Custer cover-Up: the original Maps of the Custer Battlefield"" -My opinion: the maps are of such terribly poor printing quality that they are useless. How about junk? I found much beter maps of far better quality in several other books and far better qualilty. I consider this the worse of several Custer books I have purchased. Not recommended !"
4,Capture a Perspective!,"This is the first book I've read by David Cook. He reminds me of another great illustrator. Frank J. Lohan whose books taught many new and professional artists tips and techniques for rendering any person, place or thing.I've added this to my growing collection of Drawing and Sketching the people and objects around us. I recommend it to anyone learning how to see and render buildings, any architectural marvel around our world or in our hometown.He sharres step-by-step instructions for drawing and building construction.David Cook makes it easy to create single and multi-point perspectives. You'll discover a range of useful techniques and textures.This is the perfect book to jump start your artistic skills without feeling like your just a draftsman. He sure helped my own budding drawing talent."
2,Great story--poor reading,"This budget cd will disappoint you if you're expecting the excitement that Washington Irving intended for his classic story. The reading is flat and emotionless. In a word: dull. If you can get your hands on the out-of-print Rabbit Ears edition, grab it--it's great. There's also one available on CD on the Caedmon label by Ed Begley that's quite good."
4,The Essential Whitewater Kayaker,"A friend of mine let me borrow this book, seeing how I am new to the sport, and it was great. It took me from basic rolls to maneuvering in whitewater. This book is great from beginners to experienced paddlers. No matter your skill level this book is a must. I will definately get my own copy."
5,Super buy,"Fantastic learning tool.One of the few book you can read and put into action on your own,even though you should NOT paddle alone.The best book under $10 you can buy."
4,running a boarding school?,"The book is directed mostly to the context of boarding schools and suchlike in Britain. It harks to the centuries-old tradition of affluent parents bundling their kids off to some faraway school. But nowadays, there are numerous regulations enacted regarding how such schools are to be maintained.Anderson helps the reader, who might be a principal or social worker affiliated with such a school. The book gives an overall conceptual framework within which to understand how such a boarding school could be maintained. Many issues are discussed, albeit not any great depth, given the concise nature of the text.Readers from outside Britain might well also find the book useful. Some issues, like keeping an eye on the wear and tear of the buildings, and on possible hazardous situations, are applicable to any school anywhere."
3,Killing Kelly Slowly,"Heather Graham let this one drag, it could have been done in a short story. Dead on the Dance Floor was great and I thought this one would be to ""wrong"", but I would still tell peole to read it because her books are always catching and you don't want to miss something. Kelly sounds spoiled and doesn't listen, Doug could have been more forceful and still come out looking good."
1,major disappointment,"I cannot believe that someone at Mira books did not catch all the discrepancies about the continuing characters from Dead On The Dance Floor to this book. Ms. Graham either did not remember where her major characters left off or chose, much like changing the pieces of a chess game, to simply move them to more convenient place. Among these is Quinn who goes from being a PI back to the FBI and then back again to a PI, Doug who has an affair with the victim in ""Dead..."" and then moves on to a relationship with Jane and then he says in the next book ""I swore never to get involved with a dancer again"". As if that remark is not bad enough, he and Jane are best friends in ""Killing..."" with absolutely no hint of their former relationship. This lack of continuity totally distracts from the plot and renders the book unreadable."
1,One of the worst,"This is Heather Graham's worst book in years. While the heroine is okay, if naive, the ""hero"" is a jerk. But most of the time, the hero is STUPID. His actions in ""protecting"" Kelly are ridiculous, and he becomes very unpleasant and obnoxious. What a waste."
2,Eh,"...sums it up. I only finished because I'd started it, not because it was good, by any means -at all! (For the record, a required number of words for an Amazon review? Are you serious?!?!?)"
3,Pretty Good,"Although not one of the author's best, this book still has a decent plot and a lot of suspense. It's definitely worth reading if you are a fan of the author. The one major problem with the story is that there are too many suspects and when you find out who the real ""killer"" is, it's disappointing."
2,Very disappointed,"Usually I enjoy Heather Graham's book. I like to have some intrigue mixed in with my romance, but this was horrible. The girl was naive and annoying, the guy was a jerk and there was no real plot or suspense. If you usually enjoy Heather Graham for a little suspense and some romance mixed in, do not waste your time. I only gave it two stars because it starts out ok, but I could not finish it, I felt it a waste of my time."
3,The Falcon,"The # 1 disk only played 2 times and since then when we tried to play it the disk error comes up.We cleaned the disk and DVD player but,it still will not play.The other two disk are fine."
5,GREAT BARGAIN,WELL EVERYTHING IS QUALITY..FOR BLACK/WHITE ITS OUTSTANDING. THE MOVIES ARE GREAT TO WATCH WITH A TALENTED CAST;VERY GOOD JOB AND SUPERIOR PRODUCT.
3,Cinematic Cheese?,"George Sanders once referred to these films as ""slices of cinematic cheese."" He had already done a tour of duty as The Saint and wanted out. The studio killed off his character Gay Lawrence and replaced him with his brother Tom. Sanders real brother Tom Conway took over. These films are okay, but a little heavy on the broad comic relief. One critic has written ""you long for mystery relief from the comedy."""
3,GoodsizeSupply,A good value. Not as strong as SolaRay brand. But growth is somewhat steady. And still half a bottle left two months later.
5,Just what I needed.,Excellent product. The large size made reading books and newspaper very easy. the magnifier met all expectations. Sturdy and well built.
4,will be in the US soon in some form,"For those wondering how to get an American translation of this book: The excellent literary magazine The Believer will be publishing this book in its pages in 2004 in serial form. This is according to the magazine's renewal slip. The Believer is not a cheap magazine, but it contains excellent writing about books and is worth the price.I have been introduced to several authors b/c of their articles; including Michel Houellebecq - also brian Evenson, a redisovery of Nicholson Baker and others. The regular column by Nick Hornby is also excellent. I had briefly contemplated not renewing my subscription to The Believer, but their promise to publish Houellebecq's short book about Lovecraft clinched it for me.So, I've not read this book yet; thus only four stars, but I look forward to doing so soon when it begins to be published month by month. I hope this helps the English reading fans of Michel Houellebecq and of course of H.P. Lovecraft."
3,Svp aide,"Does anyone know of a way to obtain an English translated version of this? I would try to read it in French, but I know that I would not be doing justice to it at my level. Please post advice here.Stars will be amended once I can read it.Thanks!!!"
4,"""MAN YOUR BABY MAMA LICKED MY TESTICLES""","That was a line from the Black Spooks freestyle, damn thats a tight one. Most of them are. I recommend the Chino XL freestyle, as well as Juice and Eminem. Overall this was kinda dissapointing, but still worth it, if you can find it, go and cop Volume 4."
2,Ball will not hold air,I ordered 2 balls (one for each son) one ball holds air the other does not. I sent the first one back and the second one will not hold air either. Needless to say my child is disappointed and I have not taken the time to deal with it again!
2,very desapointed,"I bought for my birthday wich was 80's style. But the ball is really small, very poor quality.Worked very good as a decoration, but when the kids started to play with, the ball came off. Didn't make 2 hours in the party."
1,No Ball,I ordered this item for an 80s themed party I am having and it came without the ball. I probably would not order products from this company.
5,And God Said What,I rec'd the order in a timely fashion and in the shape advertised. I was pleased w/ the service.
2,Too Narrow,"I have over a dozen pair of Clarks and bought two pair of the same style. The other color fits wonderfully but this pair, due to the patent leather is uncomfortable and I am going to have to take them to a shoe repair to have them stretched.Wearing them on the carpet with nylons did not do the stretching. If your feet are medium, these may not be the shoe for you. It still is cute and I plan to wear after I have them stretched."
4,A good play.,"A good play on an old theme by one of the great play writes of our times. Its a bit dated, but taking that into consideration, it still is a play with meaning."
2,Audio CD Version,I listened to an Audio CD version of the play and I regret to say that I found it unmoving. The Brooklyn accents of the characters seemed to fade in and out on occasion and they deep dark revelations about their personal lives seemed to be revealed without much emotion most of the time.I really had high hopes for the drama but felt it was more gimmick than gripping.
2,Broken Glass,"I found Broken Glass interesting but disappointing. One expects the film to hold a much deeper secret and comes away from it thinking ""This story has already been told."" The three main actors, Margot Leicester, Mandy Patinkin and Henry Goodman, are all marvelous and far better than the script allows. I found Elizabeth McGovern a rather strange choice for the role of Dr.Hyman's wife. I own this film because I'm a huge Mandy Patinkin fan, but I wouldn't have spent the money otherwise."
1,"It's a pityfest, really","I started looking at this a few years ago in a college class. I thought it was far-fetched and self absorbed then, and my recent viewing hasn't changed much. It is just not authentic or believable."
5,my first,"this is the first album i ever bought back in 1986, i saw them in concert in bismarck,nd shortly after,can't go wrong with this one,i'am a HUGE ac/dc fan and i hate to say this, but this is probably their last GOOD cd,26yrs ago!!!"
1,"Dishonest, Greedy!!","DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!! This book was never meant to be sold! It is a beautiful recollection of the events of Fatima by one of the three children and was meant to be shared, NOT SOLD! If you truly love Our Lady, you would not profit from the sale of this item nor purchase a copy! It is dishonest and greedy...it clearly states that no person is authorized to collect money for this book on the inside as shown in your picture...please reconsider pulling it from your stock and donating it and all other copies you may have to your nearest church or even better, a catholic parish. You will be blessed. If you would like a free copy please email me...crfraley1@gmail.comThank you,A friend of The Mother of Christ Crusade"
1,sheer junk,"I bought the full range of sets (3) of adjustable reamers from Grizzly. The ones I got are all made in India. If you think tools, especially cutting tools, made in China are bad, Chinese ones are great compared to those made in India. Terrible materials and workmanship. Rough threads, not evenly ground, collars snap easily. I still have these sets, but they are pretty much useless. Pay the extra money and get good ones made in USA,"
3,Reject the defects,"3 1/2With an uneven track range, the album can still easily compete amongst his best received solo outings for such strong patches of comforting reminders amidst intriguing misfires."
3,Not as great as the previous releases,"This is the fourth album from Steve, it contains three great tracks,""The Steppes"", ""Jacuzzi"" and ""Slogans"".You have also some good acoustic songs, some pop ones (The Show and Time to get out) and a funny tracks in the 1920's style (Sentimental Institution) To my taste, this one is still good but not as great as the first three albums."
5,A great forecasting book,"Most books about meteorology serve one of two audiences: beginning amateurs and budding professionals. That has left serious, mid-level amateurs in the cold. To their rescue comes Tim Vasquez with his Forecasting Handbook.The book clearly describes weather phenomena and forecasting methods and explains many scientific terms in words and pictures. Thus it goes well beyond pretty coffee-table books. Among other things, Vasquez covers arcane topics like the hypsometric equation, cold and warm baroclinic lows, and vorticity. Surface and upper-air data are available at many websites and via the author's own Digital Atmosphere software, a great mapping tool. Vasquez' book helps you make sense of them."
5,IIncredible complete...,"You won't believe that just 3 episodes can be so well done and very well told.I just bought this dvd because I love angels, especially in anime. What I didn't know was that it was going to be so spectacular and that the atmosphere was going to be a gothic one.As I said, don't think that just for it's short running time (90 min.) it's rushed or incomplete, all the contrary.The animation is just SUPERB!!!Oh, and this one is not for kids or for everyone for that matter. It includes evrything that could offend anyone: drug use, homosexuality (nothing in concrete, just the feeling), incest... So be warned.If you think you're an open minded person and/or want to try something different, this one is the right choice."
2,Disturbing and disappointing,"Being a fan of japanese animation I was terribly disappointed with this particular creation. Most likely this anime is only meant for the fans of Angel Sanctuary manga. Because otherwise you will have a hard time understanding what is happening and who are the random people you keep trying to add to the equation. To confuse you further male characters might turn out to be female and vice versa.The animation quality is disappointing. Characters spot huge disproportional chins and constantly dumb facial expressions. The main female character kept reminding me of some kind of alpine shepherdess...Well, open-mindedness aside the issue of forbidden sister-brother love totally lack subtlety and might scar you permanently with the way it's presented. The fact that the brother in question is in fact a reincarnated female angel is not helping.Unless you know what you are getting into I would not suggest this anime to anyone. IMO it's not worth neither the time nor the money."
5,Yes!,"For people who have an axe to grind against the catholic church. You've got your humor, your gore, and an interesting take on incest. A very interesting take. ;)"
1,If incest turns your stomach...,"...then don't bother with this! The story started off with good possibilities but when it went off on that brother-sister love jag it got nauseating. I haven't seen the Manga, just this OVA but am glad I only rented it not bought it."
1,Absolutely Horrendous,"I can see no reason whatsoever for anybody to ever watch this Ova. It's absolutely dreadful. The plot and characters never get a chance to really develop and personally I'm totally grossed out by the fact that Setsuna lusts after his own sister. I've never been a fan of these super dark, angst-filled, disgusting kind of plots. Who wants to watch a series about a bunch of characters whom are impossible to like?"
3,Angels Are Around Us All,"This certainly is not your average Anime. I think most people are attracted t it because of the art work.I can completely understand why. It's some of the most beautiful and expressive that I have ever seen.However, if you don't do any home work on this series.You'll be very surprise about what it is all about.First off, incest is the biggest key issue in this Romeo and Juliet tale.Honestly, it isn't like any thing I have ever seen before.Not just in Anime. Leave it to the Japanese to make incest romantic and interesting.I did some home work before viewing. Yet I was still surprised by the story line.It's a shame that I can not find the manga for this. More then likely it's better ( they usually are. )This Anime is not for every one. Just be very careful getting in to it and do some looking into it first."
2,"Interesting plot, but the blood....","Blood, gore, blood, gore. Thats what most of the art is made out of. Really, I can't stand it. ICK!It starts with our male lead,Setsuma, thinking about how he is in love with his sister, and I mean real love. Not the kind of kid-sister thing.His life only gets worse when he finds out he is the rencarnation of female Angel-gone-wrong Alexiel, who revolted agenst God. Now he has his ""brother"" Rosiel and demons Kurai and Arachne.I didn't watch more. To much blood. In what world, heaven or hell, do people get their arms ripped off, bodys cut in half, and more on a regular basis?But my mom loved it, so I guss it can't be so bad."
4,A taste of the manga,"Though this isn't the full story of Angel Sanctuary (wish it was ;_; otherwise it would receive 5 stars) it gives you a bit of what the full story is about, and what the main character, Setsuna, has to go through. I enjoyed it, but I wish they could have continued it to the end like the manga. If only they would release the manga in English...just try to find scans online if possible!On the anime though, the animation is great! The characters are gorgerous (especially Kira XD) and every scece is beautifully drawn. The music is also worth checking out. All in all, this is a great story you don't want to miss!"
3,Doesn't do the manga justice!,"This anime did a poor job representing the manga, it is choppy, leaving out pretty much all of the background behind Setsuna, Kira, his sister, the Demons, Alexiel, Rosial, yeah pretty much everyone.However the art is fantastic, THAT matches the manga at least. Another thing is that it leaves off where the story pretty much gets is start, never finishing leaving the viewer bitterly disapointed (if you've read the manga) or just plain baffled (if you haven't read the manga)Overall I was disapointed by the lack of character development (especially from manga that has so much of it), and the lack of story line in general. But if you are a fan of the manga, and just want to watch the characters from the novel in ""true life."" then perhaps this anime is for you, otherwise, I recommend the graphic novel over this anime anyday."
4,A True Manga Fan's Perspective,"I read alot of manga and watch huge amounts of anime. I have this series both in manga and anime form. Sadly I have noticed poor reviews reguarding the anime. At first I was disappointed with this anime because as noted previously ""it doesn't do the manga justice."" However, in my attempts to come accross more of this anime, I realized that this anime is only the OVAs. There will be a full fledged series coming out sometime next year. Yes, it is short, but don't knock it just yet as there is more to come. I do however suggest reading the manga as the anime will throw you off if don't know the underlining plot. The manga is fantastic and I am dying to see the anime series as a whole."
2,Don't buy it!,This movie SUCKED... the acting was horrifying. The only good thing about this movie was the art. I warn you people.. beware.x.X I should have used my money to get the comic books. Those are probably a 100 times better then this movie. Ugh.
4,Confused?,"When I first watched this OAV I got really confused. I had been a fan of the artwork for along time. I had also read the first of the manga in the series. I was confused as this is just the first instalment of the anime. I know there is a volume 2 hanging around somewhere in Japan and they haven't translated it. I didn't know this at the time and I was confused about the fact it just ended at the end of the first manga, didn't continue.Yes its confusing but if you read the 20 odd manga and if you buy the other DVDs when they come out they become clear."
5,You'll never believe it!,"These socks not only cover the entirety of my feet, they also offer cushioning between my soft foot flesh and the marginally harder brushed suede leather of my loafers or my sneakers or even my sandals (that's right, I'm a socks with sandals kind of guy).I also find that while wearing these Wigwam socks my feet don't develop that somewhat decayed aroma of a mulch pile until I've worn them perhaps ten days (unless I wade through water, then it's more like six days). After that a wash with extra bleach and hang 'em on the line for a couple hours and they're good as new...the socks that is, not my feet."
3,Comfortable but blisters on longer runs,"I've been searching for socks to run in ever since my normal running socks became more difficult to find. I really wanted to like these Wigwam socks and my first impression was that they were extremely comfortable. The first few runs that I did in them were fine but when I wore them during a 12-miler, I developed blisters on one of my toes. I tried them with a different pair of shoes and the same thing happened. I understand that sometimes blisters happen, although for me it's usually due to rain or 18 miles or some combination, but this seems to be a regular occurrence in these socks once I get over 6 miles.I'll continue to wear these socks for shorter runs (less than 6 miles) and to the gym since I do find them very comfortable but I'll skip them on the long run days."
4,True to the Sport,"This is one of the few fencing movies which attests to the true nature of the sport. Being head of a fencing team from a major university, it's hard to impress me in that aspect, but the film was remarkable. Beyond the fencing, Abraham delivers an excellent role, making this movie worth-while to fencers and non-fencers alike.There is a cheesy side plot of two fencers falling in love and while it does detract some from the movie, it merely serves to offer the viewer a break from the intensity of the movie.Overall, it was a fanstastically directed film, the cinematography on the final fight scene just added to the overall effect of the film."
5,from a fencer: Flawed but fun movie,"As a fencer, I feel the need to warn anyone reading this isn't a very good movie about the modern sport of fencing. Many liberties are taken in the interest of presenting this material to the people in Peroria. As a movie-watcher, I was distracted by too many side characters and side stories. Objectively looking at it, this is definitely a 'B' movie in my book. Trick is, I love it. I own a copy and have watched it dozens of times. I know many lines before they're said. As a fencer, I am grateful that someone made a very respectable effort to do a film with the modern sport of fencing as its backdrop. With a little suspension of disbelief, I find the fencing parts very entertaining. As a movie-goer, I admire the producers' efforts to try to bring in all age groups and genders with the many characters and side stories. If you're looking for Oscar material, pass this up. If you want a fun modern swordplay-themed drama, see it!"
4,"An Excellent Movie, Except if you a Fencer.","I saw this movie a while ago and I must say that I found it really instering. I was well put together and the plot was intering. I was disapointed with the ending though, It was too predictable. I am a competive fencer and I have to say if you are a fencer and are planing on watching your some good, acurate fencing...your in for a big disapointment."
5,Eric Roberts is an actor we'd like to see more of,My husband insisted I watch this with him - I finally found it for a descent price here on Amazon. I enjoyed this movie - it was sort of slow compared to todays movies but I enjoyed it. We are Eric Roberts fans. He was mean in this but still a great actor.
5,"Terrific drama! Can't understand why it wasn't a famous, HUGE hit","Why this movie didn't go down as Eric Roberts and F. Murray Abraham's best film is beyond me. I really dug it, and am bummed that I can't rent it again --not even w/Netflix.Mark Young - Iron Mountain, MI (the U.P.)"
3,THE sward fight.,"The plot in this is very slow. It is mainly about interpersonal relationships and humanity in general. If you like that kind of fried-green-tomatoes style I would recommend it. Otherwise, I would say fast forward to the end and just watch the final duel. WOW! It's worth renting it just for that. This should be the aspiration of every cartographer, cameraman, and director including a sward fight in their movie. I can't speak to it's fencing authenticity, but I know it looked intense."
1,Not as represented,"When I received my order for this item (Bulgur Wheat, Light, 1 lb., from Barry Farm), it wasn't the light bulgur wheat with the hulls removed as illustrated, but the dark version with the hulls not removed. I rated it one star because the product was not as represented and because Barry Farms did not respond to my request to return it. It's OK if you want the brown bulgur wheat."
4,good seller-bad buyer,the order was sent timely. it wasn't exactly what i thought it would be but that's my fault not the seller's. i just gotta figure out how to use it now
4,Where'd She Go?,"The second album from this stunningly attractive woman is full of beautiful songs. A woman of fabulous vocal ability, she reaches high on the beautiful ballad ""When The Next Teardrop Falls."" ""Tomorrow"" is also good."
1,Feather Tether,"I purchased this item a few days ago. I eagerly awaited its arrival. Once it arrived I was sorely disappointed for the following reasons:1- There are a bunch of metal clips that would project themselves into the birds body.2- The size chart was incorrect. I purchased the medium size which says fits Congo Greys. This wouldn't fit my bird if I starved him for a week or two.3- The harness is not adjustable.Overall rating I would give this item is a zero. Anyone who loves their bird should not put this on the bird. It is not a safe item in my opinion, and I certainly would not recommend it to anyone."
2,couldnt get to work tried 2 pairs,"I had tried to use these headphones at walter reed army hospital an they wouldnt work, i have a pair of sony headphones at home that work great, dont know what was wrong with them,,"
3,Quite Interesting.,Quite a nice cd to put on rather low and do something else rather than try to concentrate on the music.
3,Bob Sinclar.... A living legend....,"I remember buying the my first Bob Sinclar cd ""Paradise"". I was more or less totally overwhelmed by his talent for mixing and compiling so many different tracks together on one cd. ""Champs Elysées"" continues to show Sinclar's talent for making groovy and cool House music. The cd is musically quite varied. My all time favourites on this cd is track no. 2 ""I feel for you"" which is so inspired by the Disco sound together with the Housebeat, no. 6 ""Life"" which is a classic Soultrack, No. 9 ""Ich Rocke"" which is a very groovy, track no. 11 ""Darlin'"" another soultrack and finally track no. 12 ""My only love"" which is very cool deep Soulhouse with deep vocaling. I would recommen this cd to anyone who likes partyorientated House. I have been looking for Sinclar's ""Paradise"" to review, but without any luck. ""Paradise"" is far more varied and consists of mainly deep house club tracks. Buy it if you run into it!!"
1,Pass on this one if you can,"Sloppily written, poorly edited and overpriced. It makes me wonder how well the writer really knows her subject. The illustrations don't shed much light, either.There are inaccuracies or misleading assertions on nearly every page. Consider this gem: ""The use of dual paths over a single transmission medium is called half-duplex. In half-duplex or HDX transmission, two wires are typically used: one to transmit and one to receive. As data is transmitted over one path, the other path remains idle waiting for the the signal to change direction or perform what is called line turnaround. HDX transmission is used for the application described as well as the first portion of voice or data transmission.""This was a required text, but I won't be keeping it around for reference."
4,Specimen Days and Collect,"Did not finish, but did not expect this to chronicle his experience as a visitor so to speak of civil war victims. It is well written and an interesting chronicle of the useless loss of lives, brothers against brothers, of the war. Too bad we have not learned our lesson!"
1,Gave out after 2 weeks,"Started great, very fun and enjoyed but after about 2 weeks of normal play started to get static instead of voice. Eventually no voice and only static which then turned into no sound by the end of the week. My husband took apart and tried to fix (electrical engineer) but no use."
2,Kind of cheap,"Nice concept but two people have to be plugged into the base to use it. If you're too close to the base then you get feedback, if you go too far then the cords come un-plugged, etc... It's in the toy box, probably will never see the light of day again, good thing it was only $12."
2,Forgettable,"I am a massage therapist, and therefore always on the lookout for relaxing music. This is my first time trying the Musical Massage series, and I'm disappointed. The best massage music is both relaxing and beautiful to listen to. This CD, on the other hand is bland and forgettable. It doesn't seem to enter the consciousness at all. If you're looking for a masterpiece in soothing music, try Spirit Visions by Anakwad. You won't be disappointed."
5,"Prompt shipping, good product.","Exactly what I expected, having seen this book before. New Condition. Nice product, good seller!"
4,In The Mood,"Good selections, well produced, good price, and if you like the original big band recordings, most done before hi-fi, you will like this bargain set. Recommend."
4,"when critical thinking, computer and math meet at one","this book takes you into the world of basic pure math. it covers the basic elemects of math such as sets, functions, and proofs. but what is really making this book great and far apart from other similiar books is its elaboration of recursive function and computability, and i find it interesting."
4,A good addition for MST fans,"This volume is not the best but is still very fun. The Godzilla movie is especially well done.Note that, as with many of the MST's, some movies and commentary are not suitable for children."
4,"Attention, G fans!","This is the only way to get Megalon on DVD without getting a bootleg or the awful Alpha one, now outta print.Anyways, a great show, and a great movie...worth the price alone!"
5,A fan all the way,Wouldn't miss owning any of their compilations. just good ole dorky fun and some great awful films! Keep them coming!
1,Failed to deliver,"I was exstatic when this boxset came in the mail. I had wanted it for a while. Much to my surprise, when I opened it up, it was discless. All that was sent to me was the box. Now i can't prove this, I can only give my word. However, one evidence that's on my side is the wrapping. It wasn't the same as all my other MST3Ks. This one had a harder, more 'crinkly' wrapping while normal MST3Ks have a softer wrapping. It could just have easily been opened up, and re-wrapped in this different material. I contacted the company and have yet to get a response. This company still has my money while I have no movies. I plan on ordering another one (from a different company) but I want a resolution to this problem before I do that."
1,Did not recieve this video,I would love to tell you about this but I ordered it and was told it is now not available.
5,This Set Kicks Major Booty,"First of all I like to say that I have been a MSTie since I first watched Wild Rebels and I must say that I get so excited everytime Rhino puts out a new set. I enjoy the sets so much better than buying them in singles because of the variety you get. I also enjoy the fact that they are finally releasing some of the episodes from the Joel era because even though I like Mike just as much as Joel, it is just nice to some of there older episodes getting their chance at DVD immortality. With of that being said, all I can say is please buy this set. I hope ToHo studios gave the green light for Rhino to use the Godzilla movie because we don't want to have to deal with an amazing colossal blunder if all of you MSTies out there know what I mean."
5,a great read,"Charlie Stella delivers the goods in CHARLIE OPERA. Readers of his previous crime novels, EDDIE'S WORLD and JIMMY BENCH-PRESS, know how good this guy is, and CHARLIE OPERA reads like his break-out book. Its protagonist, Charlie Pellecchia, is a beleaguered Everyman whose vacation to Las Vegas turns into a very dark comedy of errors. The book is a neon-lit trip through a hall of mirrors where betrayal masquerades as honor, ambition as justice, and revenge as redemption. It's up to Charlie to sort it all out and try to find one true thing. Highly recommended."
2,charlie opera,Please! I could not even get half way into the book. I sometimes let other people read my books after I am done with i but I could not even do that to my friends. I don't even think I put it for sale on amazon. Terrible book!
4,Its a really good book,"I throughly enjoyed this book, it was the first book I have ever read by the author Charlie Stella but it won't be the last, I downloaded it to my kindle so it was a bargain too!"
1,Poor Image Reproductions,"For a film book that calls itself a ""visual analysis"" this volume has the worst image reproductions of any film book I've ever seen. Most of them are black and white, and so poorly reproduced they make every film look like ""Battleship Potemkin"". There are only eight pages of color images, but the color is washed out and looks sun faded. Only ""2001"", ""Barry Lyndon"", and ""Eyes Wide Shut"" are represented in the ""color"" section. Seriously, it looks as if they ran the videos and took photos of the television screen. Also, you will find that several films are not covered in any depth whatsoever. This is a poor tribute to Kubrick."
4,"Stanley Kubrick, A Visual Analysis","The book was in excellent condition. I bought the book for my Son, he had to have it for college class. I am very pleased with the book."
4,Uma Análise Visual,"O melhor livro sobre Kubrick se voc pretende ter uma viso mais acurada das imagens e intenes de seus filmes. Bem mais gratificante do que ler a biografia feita por LoBruto. Walker analisa o trabalho de Kubrick para esplicar o autor e no o contrário, como o acima citado autor. Só na análise das cores nos filmes é que o livro é um tanto rasteiro, pedindo por uma ampliao. Mesmo assim, é melhor do que nada, visto a escassez desse tipo de discusso em outros livros sobre o autor."
2,Not that great,"There are plenty of video game references in this movie, and they are somewhat amusing. However, after a while the references feel kind of forced. And the acting was very emotionless."
5,I'm not a model airplane guy but...,"This book was written by Bill McCombs, a long-time stress engineer who worked at Vought Aircraft. He was a co-author of Bruhn's 'Analysis and Design of Flight Vehicle Structures' and was an industry expert in aircraft structural integrity. I was privileged to take a class from Bill in the late 90's and have a great deal of respect for the man and his contributions to the industry. I own all of his aircraft analysis publications and they are outstanding. I assume he put the same level of care and detail into this publication; it appears as if he did. I bought this book to round out my library of Bill McCombs' publications, but I'm sure that if you are into designing and building your own model airplanes, I doubt there is a better reference for you."
2,A second opinion needs to be echoed,"I hesitate to go running about writing reviews of older CD's, but as a Mind's fan, but not a fanatic, I feel it's probably necessary to point out that this is for true believers only. Nothing from this makes my MP3 playlist, it's grossly political and bombastic in the worst possible way, a briefly popular band trying to make a ""statement"" album. Frankly, it's embarrasing, and I wish it would go away, because anyone who buys this CD first won't ever buy anything else by this band, and that would be a shame."
5,single and depressed,"I read miss velardo's book and found it very infomitive I my self have been siting home feeling sorry for my self after the divorce. her positive attuide has help me to get up off of the couch and go up and injoy live. as everbody says after going to a wake of a friend, "" you only live once"". so get the hell out of the house and enjoy the very short life we have left. thank you miss velardo."
5,Every clergyman needs a copy,"As said in the title, every clergyman needs a copy of this book. It belongs in every sacristy. This prayerbook was made for the US Episcopal Church (ECUSA, Anglican). It uses traditional language (i.e., ""thee,"" ""thou,"" etc.). The prayers and blessings are second to none. They are solid in theology. If the prayer is a blessing, there is no doubt to any hearer whether the item was blessed (unlike the Roman Catholic ""Book of Blessings"" and the ECUSA ""Priests' Handbook""). The prayers for the dead maintain the traditional dignity lost in some modern rites. Some may not like that there are a few ""Marian"" inclusions, however they round out the prayers. This would be useful for Catholics and Protestants alike."
3,Great first side; rather cheesy second side,"I'm of two minds with this disc: the first track is among Oldfield's best work ever, while the latter half of the disc is rather cheesy and at times (during Punkadiddle, especially) borderline unlistenable.I give the first side *****, the second *, for an average of ***. Buy it on sale."
4,A fun romp with some variety that falls short of the mark,"A fresh new sound from Oldfield, and the first four tracks are smashes and sound best played in that order. The other tracks dabble around with Celtic overtones and various mood pieces. Punkadiddle is a rousing number that I always visualize a quartet of athletic Greek dancers performing to. Why Oldfield included a dubious remake of ""I Got Rhythym"" I don't know. Perhaps he just ran out of gas and came up with this filler. C'mon Mike, you are much too talented to rehash someone else's works."
5,Oh my!,"I will admit, I saw this movie before I read the book. But what a good movie it was! It's not so much a movie as it is a miniseries as it took a while to watch, but it is worth it, since miniseries are often able to put in more of the book than a movie whose time must be restricted.The acting, props, costumes, and background were all solid, and I have no complaint. It was especially fun to see Moll stare right into the camera. For me, that added some spice and fun to watch, especially when she looked at you while she was doing something naughty. Overall, I feel that this movie was a rather decent retelling of the book."
3,Not a good version,"I watched the miniseries when it came on PBS and I was excited when it came on DVD but have been disappointed. Several scenes have been omitted from the DVD version including Roland's first romantic overture to Moll in a beautiful circlular garden, and when she finds herself spiraling into wickedness she prays to God for help and then turns to the camera and says ""do you think He helped me, has He ever helped you?"" They're small omissions but I considered them important and with no subtitles of any kind, I can't recommend this edition and regret buying it myself instead of seeking out the PBS version."
2,Not the original Masterpiece Theatre presentation,"I first saw this film on Masterpiece Theatre in two parts. Each part had an interesting BBC intro. I later bought the film on two VHS tapes, each tape had the original intros at the beginning. This DVD set is missing the intros and whole scenes are missing. Worst of all, the soundtrack is completely different, changing the whole tone of the film. The original soundrack was definitely better as it was more appropriate to each scene. I still have the old VHS tapes and prefer them to the new DVD set because of these changes. I wouldn't have wasted my money if the product description had included the fact that this is an edited version with a different soundtrack -- as it should have."
2,Unrated?,"I feel that this movie should be R, just for the fact alone that there are many, many nudity scenes. We had to fast forward the movie so many times, the plot was confusing. My 9 year-old cousin owns this movie, and he watches it all of the time. If this movie was perhaps rated, and rated appropriately, maybe he and his family could have been warned ahead of time. While this movie did have a good plot, once it got going, and had a good portrayal of the book, I hardly think it was as good as everyone thinks. Maybe if they had cut back on the nudity, or covered the nudity up, this could have been as great of a movie as everyone says."
2,Not as entertaining or interesting any,"I reviewed this movie two times already when I was 9 and I thought that it was all that before. Now, I really see that it is a big bunch of ignorant scenes put together. Like my cousin, Michelle said, the repetitive nudity in this movie is completely unnecessary and just the constant sex alone is so unneeded.I am find myself more to like the big screen version starring Robin Wright. It's o.k., BUT I HAD TO FAST FORWARD SO MANY FRIGGIN' TIMES!!!"
2,sorry to all of the fans,I didn't find that this movie was all it was said to be. It was not that great and I found that the nudity was COMPLETELY unnessesary. I feel that the directors could have at least covered the people up. Hi Caleb!
2,wrong casting job for this film,the heroine simply turned out to be too clumsily big-mama sized unattractive. she didn't look a bit like young woman that might differred her from other women around her. and the screenplay was a poorly adapted one that made the viewing a clinched no-brainer. the storyline is too tasteless and boring that made the viewing a painful endurance.
3,Moll Flanders,"Based on the classic book by Daniel Defoe,this adaptation of ""Moll Flanders"" is quite good.The main character is played by Alex Kingston who is good at her role.The whole cast is good as well...It's a compelling story,and sometimes funny.Moll even interacts with the viewer! it differs in some ways from the book,but not like the Robin Wright Penn movie version,it's so diferent you don't even recognize! This version-let me forewarn you with you're going to watch with your family!-,has a LOT of sex scenes,and i just thought that they used that a bit too much.But don't get me wrong,this movie is good,and is worth watching...*** 1/2"
5,It's The Movie You Want to Get!,"It's one of the best versions of the classic Defoe tale about Britain's most wanted woman. Moll Flanders is a story about a woman's life in which involves being a prostitute, a wife 5 times one time being married to her own brother, a whore, a thief and a transported fellon in Virginia. It's a very funny, saucy Exxon Mobil Masterpiece Theatre presentation. But it is going to be a shock for those who like Daniel Defoe's Robinson Crusoe, for it is really racey. But nudity or no nudity, this is a five star movie for all teens and adults to enjoy. ""A Must See!"" From me!"
1,BFS on the March...,"I don't know what it is with BFS. This is a great ITV adaptation of Defoe's Moll. Unfortunately, BFS's transfer does not appear to do this superb show justice. There is no information on the BFS website about the aspect ratio of the transfer. The original is widescreen (1:66 or 1:78). The BFS transfer is, if Amazon is accurate (not always the case, by the way) 1:33. So if you don't mind missing a significant part of the show buy it. As for me I will stick with the ITV release in the correct oar I purchased some time back and will remain annoyed by the BFS tradition of not telling consumers anything about the oar on the packages or website and of and transforming a widescreen film or TV programme into a TV screen box oar. Pathetic and sad. I expect more but I never get it from BFS."
4,Forgotten Fulci,"What a masterpiece. Most of you know Lucio Fulci as being the king of over the top gore and violence with films like The Beyond, Zombie, and House By the Cemetery. Fulci is much more reserved in this quiet subdued thriller yet the film is still one of his strongest works. Instead of the gore he uses much more suspense and build up and keeps you guessing throughout. The film has that 70's glaze which I love and amazing poster art as well. I just recently picked up an original 1977 print of the poster. Don't miss this movie. It is way overlooked and needs to be necessitated.*mike"
2,sound was awful,Very poor film with even worse transfer to DVD. I literally had to turn up the volume to its loudest just to barely hear what was being said. This movie stinks now and even by standards of the day it was made it stinks. I'm afraid that's the kindest I can be to this film.
4,Wonderful Interpretations of Disney Tunes,"There's a lot more in the music of Disney films than one--than _I_--thought, and the musicians here do a fine job of making it clear, giving you a different point of view but always with respect for the music. You can tell that in Tom Waits's vision, the dwarfs sweat, belong to the UMW, and head out for a beer after a day at the mines. Buster Poindexter's utterly over-the-top ""Castles in Spain"" is as much fun to listen to as it clearly was for him to sing. ""Feed the Birds"" is heartbreakingly beautiful, as is Bonnie Raitt's ""Baby Mine."" Ken Nordine's soundscapes set the mood at the beginning and especially near the end. Disney film music is not just for kids, and this CD proves it."
3,Not hte best cd to buy,"I have bought several Disney cd's like this one and this is my least favorite. Some of the arrangements I feel could scare a young child, like Hey Diddley Dee. The one that I do enjoy is the title song...It is very much the mother's lullaby being sung acapello."
2,~ eh,"So you wanna know what SINEAD O'CONNOR'S ""One Day My Prince Will Come"" sounds like? Maybe not, but that was the reason I hunted down this disc for so long and paid a pretty penny for it. Well, for the Sinead fans, I write this review. That song is little over ONE minute long. Sinead barely sings on it. She's basically TALKing out the lyrics in a breathy and deep voice, only throwing a pinch of melody into it at the last few lines. She could've done so much better!! I'll keep the old, enchanting Snow White. The music itself is a bare minimal amount guitar-strumming. So basically, completists shouldn't pay too much for this.As for the rest of the songs on this disc, sure, they all sang and played but none of the songs caught my interest. The overall sound IS more rock/pop than your usual lovely children's fluff. Final analysis: Blehhh."
3,Don't close your eyes,"This album features various types of performers doing Disney songs. It is a pretty uneven album. Some of them are good, some of them are not so good. Different people will like different performances, depending on their taste. My favorites are by Tom Waits, Buster Poindexter, Aaron Neville, Sinead O'Conner, Sun Ra and Harry Nilsson. There were some performances I didn't really care for, but I won't mention what they are. One problem that I had with this CD is that many of the songs are connected together as ""medleys"". So that makes it hard to skip around and just listen to your favorite songs. You may have to sit through something you don't like to get to something you do like."
5,One of my favourite albums,"I picked this up back when it was originally released. Such a fantastic set of original interpretations by so many diverse and talented artists. This is NOT your standard Disney. You can find those anywhere. This is a musical treasure that allows those musicians who love the Mouse, express that love with their own takes. A wonderful find."
5,"Great lullabies for big kids and adults, too!",Had a copy of this album on *cassette tape* in the 90s; cannot wait to rip this CD to mu iPod now that it's arrived! Bought the Rock-a-bye colection of albums as lullaby song to play for our newborn that wouldn't drive mom and dad batty with saccharine sounds. This CD is better -- takes so many familiar and good Disney tunes and adds a mature sound that baby and parents can appreciate.
4,Better than expected,"I must say that I wasn't expecting much from The Family Man when I first started watching it, but I was quickly drawn in by the character development for Nicolas Cage and Tea Leoni. I thought that the movie was well done, and recommendable, and on its way to being a great movie. Then the end happened. It wasn't necessarily a BAD ending, it was just kindof weak. It didn't kill the movie though. I would happily watch it again. It wasn't too weak of an ending, it just wasn't too strong of an ending. Nicolas Cage delivered a fun to watch and believable performance as a snooty and wealthy business man who sees what would have happened if he stayed with his college sweetheart. The PG-13 rating reflects a few cuss words and some sensual sequences, including some clouded nudity through a shower door. Other than that though, it's not too inappropriate for kids. As a whole, The Family Man delivered, and I was happy to have watched it."
4,Heart warming story,"First I want to tell you I am not into romantic movies, but this one did it for me. I first saw part of this film when I was over a friends house, then I decided to buy it for my self and I am glad I did. It stars Nicolas Cage as a wall street hot shot who gets a chance to see what his life would have been like if he took a different road. He sees a simplier life with his old college sweet heart and the kids he never had might have been a better choice. It has a nice ending. This movie is made in the great tradition of hollywood's golden era. Watch it."
5,Really enjoyable @}->---,"This is such a good movie. It's part comedy but mostly drama/fantasy. Nicholas Cage is not always on par in the movies he's in, but here he is superb. He plays Jack who lives the 'good' life (Ferrari, luxurious Manhattan penthouse apartment, escorts etc). One night (Christmas Eve) he's in a convenience store when he meets the man that will change his life. Don Cheadle has the power to give him a glimpse into what his life would have been like if he'd stayed with his college sweetheart instead of going off to England to further his career. During his glimpse, he learns a lot about what is important in life. It took a while for him to do so; he even once tried to bring his family life back into his 'good life'.Basically, this movie is warm and moving and touching. There are some good lessons in it, and it's really enjoyable. Jeremy Piven has a small role and he's great in it too. If you like feel good movies, treat yourself to this. It's a great movie that I still watch often."
3,Faded at the finish,"Film started off with an akward transition to a glimpse of how life could be had Nicolas Cage chosen a differnt path earlier in his life. Your really have no idea how it happens or why, but there you go. A great story from there on. You feel hopeful that love wins out over money and poser, but then the disappointing finish. Nicolas Cage's character is sent back to his previous life, with no possible way of continuing on the path he had been on for most of the movie. He finds his lost love, whose personality is completely different, and convinces her to give life with him a try in less than 20 minutes of conversation. No kids, no house, both are power hungry and wealthy. Not really what the glimpse was all about."
3,Good family movie,"This is what I would call a ""feel good"" movie. It makes a person take a look at the choices they've made in a whole different light."
4,A great holiday movie,A great movie! My husband and I both like this one. Christmas time or any time you will enjoy this!
1,Surprisingly Stupid,"The acting in this is fabulous.The sets are wonderful.The pacing is good, for this kind of fantasy-based thing.However, the values preached are little short of hideous.The ""family man"" (Jack Campbell) is given a graphic choice between two lifestyles: the hyper-hedonism of a mega-merger stockbroker, and the frantic dailiness (diaper-changes, picking the kids up, etc.) of a suburban housedad.Remember: when given a choice between (a) or (b), choose (c).These two choices are both soul-destroying, and to force anyone to choose either/or is the depth of sadism.And the end of the movie suggests that he can have BOTH--Hell squared.Why would anyone want either?"
1,Nicolos Cage?!!!!!!why him?,"First of all Nicolos Cage has never been the best actor.I would have to say that the only good movie he was in was ""Face Off""Any director that picks him must be desperate for actors.This movie was so boaring.How about some excitement?Were did they go wrong there?"
1,Take away Cage's SAG card for this one,"I won't belabor the point. I was forced to watch this by my momand one of my aunts last Christmas. It was hard to keep from gagging. It would be nice to see Tea Leoni play a decent character someday. Cage - what can you say? Snake Eyes, City Of Angels, Bringing Out The Dead, and this piece of (euphemism forexcrement). He sure can pick 'em, can't he? A simply wretched film, there is absolutely no other way to describe it. Manipulative, embarrassing, patronizing. GARBAGE!"
4,Great Holiday Film! Leoni and Cage are A+!,"""The Family Man"" is a WONDERFUL film to see December 23 or 24th with the WHOLE family! Nicholas Cage is great and Tea Leoni is stunning as a suburban wife and mother of two with Jack Campbell, (Cage), who is a wealthy New York businessman who finds that his world is changed when he catches a 'glimpse' of what his life would be like if he had married his highschool love, (Tea Leoni). The only part I wish could have been better was at the end, when Cage..NEVERMIND!- I WON'T SPOIL IT! see ""The Family Man'!"
5,A surprisingly fabulous film,"My husband and I first saw this movie in the theater in 2000. Based on the initial trailers, we were expecting your typical banal formula film. Not expecting much, we were pleasantly surprised by this wonderful film. The dialogue, emotions etc were incredibly realistic and believable....an amazing feat considering the storyline is one huge fantasty!The acting is superb....Leoni and Cage have wonderful screen chemistry. The supporting cast is also wonderful and again, believable.I have watched this movie several times, and it captures my attention each and every time. I never cease to enjoy it! My husband and I both agree that this is one of our favorite movies, even though we usually have vastly different tastes. I think it's because this movie resonates to both our experiences of transitioning from the urban professionals we were when we met to the contented suburbanite family we have become.This movie will enchant both singles and married alike....Don't miss it."
5,great,This is one of my favorite movies to watch during the holidays. It's funny and light hearted yet touching. I love it.
1,Happiness means - blue collar love- only,"I just watched this movie~ it depressed me. Apparently if you are a successful /workaholic (but like it) and do something good to prevent an armed robbery (buy off the would be robber) ~ you still are not a decent guy. To be a decent guy, you have to move to blue collar suburbia - have no money- hate your job- have a nagging wife- bratty kids- and dim wit friends, THEN you're happy. This is pure Hollywood claptrap at its finest. Hello? Not all rich workaholics are monsters, some just like to work, don't want to get married, don't want kids~ tell me what is wrong with that?This movie was terrible and utterly depressing. Watch a Christmas Carol...there's a good movie, this one is awful."
2,"The Fambly, Man","Unbelievably sappy ending. Woman evinces absolutely no interest in forgotten old flame. Man raves delusionally. Woman is fascinated and tosses career. I'd sooner believe a navy officer in dress uniform would walk into a factory, scoop up a line worker, and carry her away. Contrived idiot plot."
2,What don't I see here that everyone else does?,"This film had a very interesting idea, but it wasn't very well pulled off. In fact it was plain boring. I loved the whole idea about ""what if"", so I was looking forward to watching this. How very wrong I was.There's always something that creeps me out about Nicholas Cage. I don't know whether it's his eyes, or that someone can have such an obsession about a long dead star, that they will marry their daughter, and then get divorced a couple of months later. What is he trying to prove?The film is a mix of other different films, most noticably A Christmas Carol, but much worse. There's basically two realities in this film, much like there was an alternate reality in Back To The Future.It's just not a great film, I don't know why people are making such a fuss about it. It didn't make me feel Christmassy at all, and it was very disappointing. It won't be one I keep."
2,Swearing,"With the title of family man I did not think they would put the ""F"" word in the movie. It would have been an excellent movie if it were swear free."
5,This is not my beautiful house . . .,"Think A CHRISTMAS CARROL with a modern-day twist to it and you've got FAMILY MAN. A tale of a man who chose buisness over pleasure. When told that he would get a higher-paying job out in the big city, he agreed to fly over there and take it . . . leaving his girlfriend behind who wanted to marry him really badly. He promised that he would come back and everything but never did. Now, a few years later, he is the rich and fancy buisness man that he always wanted to be. But, one night he is confronted by a man who claims that he can give him a glmipse of what his future might have been.Now it's come true.And now he's trying to get his buisness future back."
3,"Nice film, weak characterization","Upon seeing trailers for ""The Family Man"", I immediatley expected a wanna be ""It's a Wonderful Life."" I also noticed Nicolas Cage was in the film which also lowered my expectations. Well, I saw the film and didn't get the, ""It's a Wonderful Life"" wanna-be that I expected! The story works well and pieces together nicely. But, the characters in this film are not strong enough. I found myself having to really imagine what kind of person Jack (the character played by Nicolas Cage) actually was. In conclusion, is ""The Family Man"" a good holiday film? Yes. Is it a Christmas classic as stated in the trailer? No."
3,The Family Man,"I was disturbed by this movie.Jack is a wall street tycoon who is offered a look at the road not taken. He responds to a street thug that he needs nothing in his life, he wakes up Christmas morning to find himself transported to the life he would have had, had he not dumped an earlier girlfriend in order to go to London. He discovers that he needed emotional attachment and, realizing that goes about acquiring it.All that is fine, except that at one point Jack says to his wife ""I want a life that others will envy."" She responds, ""Others already envy us."" The point of Jack's ""glimpse"" is that he needed emotional attachment in order to be a better person, not so that he could be envied that as well. ...Nicholas Cage and Tea Leoni were both wonderful in this movie, and I enjoyed watching it, but I was really bothered by the utter selfishness of its message."
4,movie,"i'm sure it's a great movie, but i wouldn't know because it was a gift for a friend. the package did arrive pretty early, so no complaints there."
4,"Funny and Interesting, but Hardly New","The Alternate Reality (TM, Its A Wonderful Life) plot device comes into play again in this film. Nicholas Cage delivers an outstanding performance as Jack, a hollow capitalist. Tea Leoni is his former girlfriend who he married in the ""glimpse"". At first he fights the whole thing, then he becomes used to his other life and wants to stay there. Cage has lots of funny lines, but the idea is tired. The contrived ending also spoils it a bit, but overall it is an enjoyable movie. I think it could have been more original and provocative if it had been the other way around: if Cage had been the husband and father given a glimpse of what he could have been if he had gone for the career and all the trappings. Now that would have been good, but it would have destroyed that sentimental, holiday theme. Good fun, in any case. -m-"
4,New Christmas Classic?,SInce I first saw this movie a number of years ago I like to include it in my list of holiday films.
4,"Tired Idea, But Still Fun","This is not ""hilarious"" as the cover falsely claims, but it does have a few moments of funniness. What would happen if you got to live the life you almost had, but passed up? It's an old Hollywood idea, but this is the modern version. Cage seems to live in the same slick highrise used in his other film ""The Weather Man."""
3,"Love the message, hate the unnecessary nudity","I love the message of this movie- that life is not about becoming the rich bachelor full of himself and yet lonely and empty and having a life of no true value. There's a value to being a faithful husband and father that is awesome and revolutionary to this world. But I'm so sad that there are several sexual/nudity scenes which make this unfit for enjoying as a family, nor as a husband/father who is trying to guard his heart from unnecessary temptation. Cut out those scenes and this movie would get 5 stars for me."
4,It's a family movie,"Life is full of compromises & The Family Man conveys this message through its main character, Jack. All of us, married folks, would find ourselves wondering once in a while, WHAT COULD HAVE BEEN if we did not marry so & so & chose our careers instead. In Jack's case, it was the opposite -- he was brought to a parallel life where he chose to settle down instead of following his high-profiled dream.Compromise. That's what we do sometimes with our lives. We cannot have everything we want, when we want it, where we want it. We give some, we take some. But the bottomline is that we should be able to find a comfortable place, where these compromises have not compromised our own happiness."
1,Dont buy it if you already owned SD DVD for this movie,"I just Want universal to know how disappointed I am when I see this one of my favorite movie and it has been 'remastered', one word 'nothing'. Universal is making faulse Advertisment for this blu-ray. I have collected quite few bluray movies, but hve never seen such awful picture so called 'bluray'. Come on be professional! If you have no such tech to make a bluray movie, please ask other companies to do that. Please dont waste our fans' passion and money!! I have literally wait this movie on bluray for a decade, so I dont mind wait for longer, but please do your job too, it's not that hard to be professional!!"
3,Robert Frost Meets Charles Dickens on Wall Street,"Nicolas Cage is the hook in this one. He plays a successful Wall Street investment banker who wakes up one day to find himself on the ""road not taken""--married to the girl he left behind almost 20 years ago. Cage does a nice job portraying his confusion. Likewise, wife Tea Leoni does pretty well as she grows into loving her ""new"" husband. Don Cheadle has a bit part as the mysterious street person who sends Cage on this adventurous way, for reasons that aren't made very clear. This movie was released at Christmastime and as such bears resemblance to the classic ""A Christmas Carol""--a ""C+"" version--I'll upgrade it to 3 stars for Cage's and Leoni's performances."
3,The Family Man dvd,"I've heard this was a movie worth-watching. I was not too happy that I was guarenteed that the movie was perfectly able to watch only to find out that it was pretty scratched and starting skipping when I played it. But I was reimbursed and given an apology, so I am appreciative of that effort."
5,Count your Blessings,"As we left the movie theatre, my husband's words to me were ""I can't wait to get home to kiss the kids."" He, the kind of guy who can't stand mushy ""chick flicks"", was incredibly moved by this story. Now every time he's feeling overwhelmed by the daily trials of life, fatherhood, and husbandom, I need only whisper ""remember when we went to see the Family Man?"" It truly makes you appreciate the magic and value of life and family.I wish the VHS would hurry and come out, because I don't own a DVD player, but this is the kind of movie that is making me consider going out and buying one so I can enjoy it that much sooner."
5,A Wonderful Movie,The Family Man is one of the best movies of the year. Nicolas Cage is absolutely incerdible. Tea Leoni and Cage play their parts so well that it actually gives you the feeling of a real-life marriage. I found this movie to have quite a few funny parts but I found it to be a very sentimental movie as well. Sometimes people don't realize what they have until they lood deep into their hearts. This movie is a great gift for any wife or girlfriend. I recommend everyone to see and buy this movie! The extra feautres are really cool! :-)
1,Do NOT buy the Blu-ray!!,"This review has nothing to do with the film itself, but rather with the very poor Blu-ray release.Universal has long had a habit of treating back catalog releases poorly on Blu-ray, but this release has to be one of the worst in recent memory.In short, it looks very, very close to no better than an up-convert from an SD DVD.There is very little additional resolution, fringing and edge enhancement everywhere, and in if you just watched the SD DVD through an up-converting DVD player you'd have almost the same quality video and save yourself the purchase.Screen shots of the Blu-ray are readily available on the web so confirm for yourself, but please don't encourage Universal to release such garbage for a premium price."
1,Did not pick or watch,We did not pick this movie nor did we watch it! I do not even know who is in this movie.
3,The Family Man,"Nicholas Cage is given a glimpse of what his life would have been like if he'd married his college sweetheart when he tells an angel that he has no regrets. It's an interesting and amusing story. It's a bit twisted though that an angel would take a happy, content man and turn him into a miserable one. The ending is a bit unsatisfactory. It leaves too many questions about the future."
4,It's a wonderful life with Tea,"After seeing this movie I was ready to propose to Tea Leoni (well, almost). This was also the first DVD I've ever purchased. There is some good bonus footage on the DVD that you didn't see at the theatre or on tape. For example, a deleted scene from the airport in 1987 where Kate made Jack a cassette tape of songs that would remind him of her. Another deleted scene was an outstanding alternate to Mintz pulling Jack aside after the job interview. Finally, another deleted scene (which I think they should have left in) after Jack goes back to his ""old"" life and Arnie doesn't recognize him."
3,A good holiday film,"This film reminds me a little bit of ""It's a Wonderful Life"" but not as good! A guy who thought he had everthing is shown that while he has material things it doen't mean his life is fullfilled."
3,Sometimes cute,"Some poignant and cute stuff. 30 minutes too long. Surprised it had 4 1/2 stars. If you are bored during the first 30 minutes, turn it off because it won't get better. Acting is good. Direction is bad."
4,We watch this film every Christmas.,"Really love this film. A modern day Grinch story of sorts. Nicolas Cage character has everything a man could ever want in worldly possessions, however does not even realize that he lacks the most important things a man could ever have. Love and family. He is given a ""glimpse"" into his life had he made a better decision years prior and is given another chance to begin again.Great redemption story."
4,"like it, nice story",I like the story. It was sweet and a bit of the wonderful life kind of thing but a nice movie and a good way to reflect
3,Great movie.... Streaming didn't work so well....,"We watch this movie every year and since our DVD is currently in a storage unit, we opted for the Amazon purchase. It would start in HD then drop to 3 or 4 dots before pausing to buffer etc and this occurred over and over to the point where we quit watching it. Unfortunate since we have great broadband here in the home. Not sure what the issue was that night but all in all it was disappointment. It gets 3 stars because I've seen the movie multiple times and know it's good regardless of my recent viewing experience."
5,Great wide angle lens,"For the price this wide angle lens is super. I am used to using a 35mm camera with various lenses, and this lets me use the more portable digital without losing the wideangle affects I like to get. It seems very well made. The only drawback is you cannot use the built-in flash as the lens blocks the light. You also cannot use the viewfinder, you have to use the LCD screen, which can be hard to see in bright sunlight."
2,Background tracks,"Although most of the information is correct, the description of the tracks containing background but no vocals is not entirely true. The tracks contain both the music AND the chorus. Made it not useful for me although the quality is good."
4,Comprehensive look at the final days,"Quite a bit of relatively rare footage here, such as the Russians of today showing us Hitler's remains and those of Goebbels and Eva Braun, which were taken at the end of WW2 and kept in Moscow by the KGB. We don't see much of the bunker itself, which was almost destroyed, but we do see a lot of footage of fighting in Berlin, as well as rare footage of Eva Braun with Hitler, and her sister's wedding. Great interviews with Hitler's adjutant, bodyguard and secretary, too. I would have appreciated more comparisons with these same sites today. What do they look like? Apparently, the bunker is covered by a parking lot. The Germans don't want to make much of a museum of their worst era, I'm sure."
4,Would like to have seen more on what that area looks like today,"Good info,he was a nut and it is still hard to believe so many still follow him."
3,"Looks nice, not well-made","We spent too much on this product for how it is made. I am happy with the way it looks, but feel it won't last for very long... the staples are already coming out of the upholstery for the chairs."
3,"This was a gift, I didn't read this book.","I purchased this as a gift for a little girl for Christmas. I didn't read it, nor do I know her thoughts on the book. It was a ""secret"" person gift, I don't know her identity."
4,Shipboard Mystery,"As an adult who never tires of historical stories and is a collector of children's books, I enjoy these books more than the adult novels bouncing around the bestseller list with their trashy mixtures of sex and violence. Samantha is not my favorite American Girl character, but I find this story an improvement on the previous Curse of Ravenscroft. The mystery was fairly compelling and there were no dollhouse beds or silly things of that nature to ruin the ending. I thought it out of character, however, when Samantha distrusts someone who is very important in her life, when in previous books she has defended the person."
4,Good artwork,"The artwork was good, it could be better but it was a good collecting piece. It gives small blurbs on some of the major characters."
5,AQ Very enjoyable book of Art.,"""The People Of Pern"" is a very enjoyable book of Art depicting the artist's interpretations of descriptions of Characters by Author Anne McCaffrey in her series of fiction books about the life and tribulations of the planet Pern. I have enjoyed reading the series for many years and continue to read the new releases authored by Anne and her son Todd, and now look forward to Todd continuing the series.The prints of the present Art book bring visualization of the Characters of Anne's stories to 'life' in my mind even further than my own imagination was able to give them.I have added this book to my library and have it to refer to when I reread the Pern Series."
3,Good entertainment for little indian,"I gave this to one of my twins for Christmas and sad to say, it's January 11th and it broke already. After he learned how to shoot it, my 5 year old boy thoroughly enjoyed it. A couple days ago however, the plastic broke off the top tip rendering it useless. Great idea, but plastic material was too thin where the string met the plastic. It is an entertaining toy, however, I would suggest looking for one that is a little better made."
5,devotional theology,A'Brakel writes with his head and heart. The books are useful for both theological study and as a devotional. Words which provoke both the head and heart to better love God
1,unsatisfied,"I had an unsatisfactory experience with this seller unfortunately. I am still waiting to be reimbursed for my return of this item. If I receive my full refund my opinion may be upgraded. I found this item for a better price some place else. It took a long time to receive instructions on how to return this and I still don't know what the status is.The item listed was not the item that was sent, so, there were a few reasons why I feel I could not give a higher rating..."
5,Awesome book,Jeff and Marge do such a wonderful job explaining what Christian marriage is all about. Both give practical suggestions that they have learned through there own relationship. They use the Scripture to interpret Scripture and are dead on right with the relationship that a husband and wife are to have with one another. I am a pastor and I give this book to each couple I counsel with and marry.
4,In the style of G.A and K+D...,"... and it has to be said to be a worthy and solid album with a distinct style of it's own. There are cross overs with other bands mentioned but it seems this is largely due to sharing a genre, a genre which explores groovy retro rifts and mixes them with ambient rythyms and hypnotic beats.Unlike the other bands mentioned and their landmark albums (Vertigo and the K+D Sessions), this album doesn't quite get that far. There is the wonderfully mellow and nostalgic ""Slip into something..."", but really as far as memorable tunes that become a part of ones history, that is really all there is.The other tracks are clever, worthy and ambient but very forgettable. Still this is a lovely album which expresses a good deal of musical intelligence and is an audible tonic, worth a try and the purchase and worth watching these guys as they hone their skills."
3,don't compare to Kruder and Dorfmeister or Air,"Some very groovy tracks, including ""Skyscraper"" and the very catchy ""Slip into Something..."" (the instrumental version is better, called ""K-I-N-O-B-E SKIT"" on the album). However, I was generally disappointed. Many of the songs are held back by very uninspired production. It wouldn't have taken much more effort to fill the songs with rich, interesting sound, but it falls short, and many songs leave you waiting for something which seems about to happen, but doesn't. Contrary to others' opinions, this doesn't come close to comparing to Air or Kruder and Dorfmeister."
5,Garam Masala,This spice is absolutely delicious. It's a huge savings and my Muligatawny soup was superb! Compare a l ounce jar in the store for $8.00 to this package of 7 ounces for the same price or less.
3,Movie is great but THIS VERSION IS EDITED!!,"The movie is awesome and I highly recommend it and the book, but I had seen my british friend's version in the UK before wantingto buy it for myself here in Canada, and when I ordered the North American version from Amazon, I found out it's edited! About 5 minutes is cut out from this version, and that pisses me off because they weren't cut for any good resaon! The scenes they cut werent violent or gratuitious in any way....just dialogue between McLoughlin and Anne, which actually make other parts of the film make less sense because they mention something said in the scenes that were cut! I love this movie but I was very disappointed with Amazon.... Get ur version in the UK if you can and just get a dual region VCR (or DVD, since you can buy it as a DVD in the Uk...)"
2,Harsh times was too harsh too watch!!!,"First off, I am only giving this movie two stars for the way Christian Bale looked in his ""wife-beater""/undershirt. Other than that, the rest of this movie was abysmal. Bale was terribly miscast in this role. The thug routine does not fit him. His talents were wasted. Freddy Rodriguez' performance was forgettable and the dialog between the two was horribly written and executed. We will not even get on the horrible accent since other reviewers already mentioned that. Eva Longoria had minimal screen time and I was wondering what the purpose of her character was. In addition, I looked at the end credits and I noticed that Bale was one of the executive producers for this. He should have rethought about putting his name on this mess. Overall, this movie was a hot""100 degree"" mess. Please avoid this like a beat down."
2,2 stars for some decent acting...,"No matter how compelling Christian Bale is or how well the other actors support him, this movie stinks. There is no connection to fact or real life in this film. The story has no plot beyond watching an out-of-control poseur (Christian Bale) who is blindly followed by a completely spineless pal (Freddy Rodriguez) into one disaster after another. I don't see how someone can extrapolate from this sad piece of work, as one review does, that ex-military people are not suited for some line of work anymore than women, short people or Latinos are not. Christian Bale's character is completely unbelievable as an Army anything much less a highly trained and disciplined Ranger designated marksman (aka sniper). I have seen Bale in other roles where he was excellent, but in this case his fine work amounts to putting lipstick on a pig. In the end, it is still a pig. You can kiss it if you want to, but I'll pass."
4,Small Film with Incredible Bale Performance,"Most films about gang life in LA are just ridiculous films that are better left to condensed music videos on MTV. Of course Bale steals the show by playing a character you want to see saved but fear to be around. Watch this film to the last shocking moment and you will empathize with Rodriguez's potrayal of a friend trapped in this claustorphobic friendship of an ex-soldier on the verge of exploding into full blown psychopath. If you've seen Batman Begins and The Prestige, watch this film and you'll be amazed at how unique Christian Bale can potray each of these characters so vividly. Without Bale this film would just be a typical straight to DVD feature, but Bale sells his performance and provides frightening realism to this film."
5,completely underrated,"This movie was very, very well done in my opinion. Ultra realistic, very gritty, very tense, extremely entertaining. Maybe it made some people squirm, and that's why they didn't like it? The acting was top-notch, and it was intense and realistic in a way that could earn the badge of ""uncomfortable"". But I love that type of movie. This movie should have garnered more attention and more praise. Christian Bale is ferocious. Grade A."
4,SIMPLY A GOOD FILM,"I think that this movie is a great film, that it is good made.very true, without effects specials."
1,Money from America,Who ever invested money in this production needs therapy as they have obviously got more money than sense.
2,A big disappointment,"This is the third time I've written a review for this movie. Both of the previous times my review was deleted for unknown reasons. So, I'll just say this, this movie is not worth buying."
1,confusing reality with a TV show,"The last person to rate this movie obviously believes anything that Hollywood produces must be the truth. Hello... This is a movie! Entertainment! Not real life. You probably believe everything you hear on the news, too."
2,Harsh Times,"This movie was a huge disappointment. Not typical of a Christian Bale movie. Rent this movie, don""t buy it if you must see it."
5,we all have some part of Jim inside ourselves,"I am a fan of Christian Bale. I would say this character impressed me much more than his roles in American Psycho, Equilibrium, The Prestige, etc. But this is not a movie for everyone, just like Bale's some other movies. If you have never been haunted by the nightmares of past unpleasant experiences, or have never gone through the struggles of trying to regain a decent life while the die-hard old habits constantly drag you back into the dark...you probably would not like this movie. This film touched my heart. Not only I can relate with the character, but it showed me how complicated and pathetic human beings are to such extent. Honestly speaking, we all have some part of Jim inside ourselves, only in much more subtle ways...if we dare to watch closely."
4,Look a little deeper...,"...and search your feelings (not to sound too much like Yoda). People who didn't like this movie either simply did not get the deeper meaning, or were expecting another glossy hollywood action movie. Listen up America, there are a lot of damaged kids coming back from Lil' Bushies War; beware, if we ignore them there will come time to ""pay the piper"". They walk among you, they hold good paying high profile ""respectable"" jobs; however, if you had any idea what goes on inside thier heads - you would hide under your bed. People who do not suffer the anguish of PTSD may never truly be able to understand what this movie represents. This movie is not about creating a ""likeable character"", it is about harsh reality."
1,Pretty Lame for a Christian Bale movie,"I thought Christian Bale didn't make full-on bad movies. I was wrong. The script is horrible. Performances are inconsistent at best. None of the relationships make much sense. I'd heard it was good, and really wanted to like it, but it was all I could do just to finish it. Seriously, don't even bother renting it."
2,Forgetable movie,"The reviews of deeper meaning to this movie...there may be some truth but this movie is not the one to see. Christian Bale produced it. I am a big fan of Christian but this movie left me wondering what he was thinking. Freddie R. is a good actor. If you must see this movie, wait for the next showing on Cable...that is where I was introduced to it."
3,Harsh Times,"My Oppinion: Harsh Times is a very good drama, but has a lousy story and is kinda boring. Christian Bale does an outstanding performance and so does Freddy Rodriguze.About The Film: Harsh Tims is about Jim an ex-army ranger who comes back home reunits with his bst friend Mike and applies for the LAPD. When The LAPD rejects him he goes into a vilont act and petty crimeand he drags his weak-milled friend mike with him. Mikes wife sees what jim is doing to her husband and pushes mike to get a job and all Jim wants to do is go out drinking and sale drugs. When Jim and mike end up with 20 kg of marjuwana jim gets a tragic end.If You Liked this movie then check out Harsh Times the original motion picture soundtrack."
1,The worst Bale movie to date,Let me first start by saying I am a huge fan of Christian Bale but this movie was incredible bad. Now Bale does however play a great psychopath in this film but the plot is nonexistent. Its as if the director/writer for this movie had the goal of making horrible production from the start.Please if you want to remain a fan of Christian Bale please under no circumstances watch this movie.
1,Very disappointing,"I kept waiting for some redeeming moment in this movie, but alas, it was not to be. Maybe the worst purchase I have ever made."
1,Harsh Movie is more like it.,The PQ and AQ are very nice. Too bad HD DVD died. This movie should have died. I am a huge fan of Christian Bale and have enjoyed all his other movies. This movie is not very good. Bale does the best he can do with this weak plot and weak script. You may want to pass this by.
3,descent flick,"This movie is a lot different than I anticipated. It wasn't as violent as I had hoped, but good plot and storyline. I would recomend seeing it first before you buy it because you may not want it after you watch it. I think it would lose it's appeal after the first or second time around. But overall entertaining."
3,Not as good as his other books,"I've enjoyed all of Bova's books that chronicle the exploration of our solar system. Compared to his other books, however, this one wasn't quite as interesting. The strength of his stories is always in the science. This story had more focus on characters, which he doesn't handle quite as well. If you liked Moonrise and Moonwar, this book is worth reading since it's the next step in the progression of that story, but if you're just starting with Bova, his books Mars, Venus, and Jupiter are much more entertaining."
2,Hmmmm...,"This book got off to a good start, but turned painfully slow and rather boring. This was my first introduction to a Ben Bova book, and if this is representative of his work at all, it will probably be my last."
2,Book One of the Asteroid Bores,"This was my first Bova book, and will probably be my last. I finished it only because I had ""made it this far, so I might as well"", and also because I was waiting for something, ANYTHING to happen involving some sort of action sequence. But no....there was nothing.Though there are some positives: the science for the most part seems legit and interesting, although the extent of the negative impacts of global warming may be more speculation on Bova's part. (no political affiliation here, just my opinion!) Also, one or two of the characters was likeable at times(although most of them were quite annoying!)For somebody to give this book a 5 is laughable! As some other reviewer noted, seemed more like a ""soap opera"" to me. In fact, all you need to do is change the cover, and you could put this one in the romance section! Oh and by the way, this guy has some serious sexual tension built up inside."
2,Maybe the sequels are better,"I was disappointed with Ben Bova's The Precipice. Since others here do an excellent job of recounting the novel in detail, I'll just mention a few things:1) Often the most exciting parts of the novel are only ancillary to the main story.2) Bova's climate alarmism is readily apparent and annoying.3) The so-called ""New Morality"" makes no sense (i.e. it has no basis in the reality of what people believe today and where those beliefs seem headed). Bova simply comes across as mildly anti-religious.4) Much of the novel seemed downright dull, plodding - as if Bova was terribly bored with his own creation and simply going through the motions.I really wonder if the sequels are any better, or if they're even worth the effort. At this point, I would have to say probably not."
4,Great character development. Good plot line.,"My review here is similar to my review of ""The Silent War: Book III of The Asteroid Wars.""Bova does a superb job of keeping all of the stories in the ""Asteroid Wars"" series connected. When you begin the next book, you feel as if you have not skipped anything. Bova is at his best regarding story telling and character building.I did not give a rating of 5 stars for the following reasons.--The story does not discover something new. I like Sci-Fi to examine science discoveries human or otherwise.--There are no mysteries. It is a typical story about business vs. government and human greed vs. altruism.--Bova lends credence to the notion of climate change.I recommend this story to Bova fans and Sci-Fi fans.Have a good read."
4,Good Science Fiction,"Although it's not excatly a new book, I've only read it now. The Precipice ended up being an extremely entertaining book, well written, and with a good pace. Well-woven and credible story with good tridimensional characters that glued you to the pages of the book from the very beggining. I'll definetely be reading the rest of the Asteroid Wars series.The only drawback, at least in the e-book version, is that it seems that the letter recognition was not perfect, with several words being transformed into others that could or could not make sense depending on the context. Although I am not a native speaker I can navigate fairly well in this muddy waters, but for someone a little less proficient than myself I'm sure that it would not be easy."
3,Lots of typos in the Kindle version.,"I like this author, and this book is quite enjoyable. I don't know how they created the Kindle version, but it looks as if it may have been scanned from a hard copy, creating a number of distracting typographical errors. I'm reading it on Kindle for iPad."
2,just not there,"Sorry Ben, I can't even finish it. You should get a new editor. Lots of great ideas that just don't manage to pan out. I just kept hoping (expecting) it would get better. Then I read the reviews here and realized, its not going to get better. It just as superficial all the way through. I have so little time to read and live in these wonderful Sci-Fi worlds. I need to use my time to enjoy one that truly takes me away from the present day. I honestly don't mean any disrespect but I cannot recommend this book to anyone. This one needed another draft. In fact, I'm wondering if maybe you are letting someone else write your books now, outsourcing, taking advantage of writer mills maybe. I'm sorry. It just wasn't up to the stature of your reputation."
2,Nothing to see here,"I'm a huge fan of Ben Bova, but this novel is simply not good. As a continuation of the chararcter Dan Randolf, I was really looking forward to it. Unfortunately, the book really becomes nothing more than Randolf running around begging for money. I also think the book is missing any kind of real climax, it's really a setup for the next novel in the series (I assume).I thought ""Colony"" was an awesome saga. ""The Precipice"" is aweful soggy."
4,COLTRANE!!!!!,"This album proves how talented and how clueless Gomez is. The ""throwaways"" on this album out sparkle a lot of the more ""famous"" Gomez songs, Steppin' Out, Champagne For Monkeys and Coltrane in particular. Worth the purchase price. An interesting mix of Gomez ""hits"" and B-sides. Enjoy"
4,Metal Magic,"It don't get much better than this, my metalheaded friends. Grand Magus is awesome and I think this is their finest achievement, even though it is different from their first two, which were more doomy. This one bristles with metal and is tasty in the songwriting department--which is really important to me. And JB is a superb metal vocalist IMO. A grand, superior achievement. Buy now!"
4,A balanced study of nuclear insanity,"Naftali and Fursenko have done a excelent piece of research in this interesting book about the Cuban Missile Crisis. In particular, they highlight the close to insane policies of the Russian Government as they sought to bolster the Cuban regime from US attack. This book gives the whole picture including the bay of pigs and other US misadventures that drove Castro into the Soviet orbit. The most fascinating section for me was the part on Castro and way he was compelled to adopt Soviet style communism. The US simply did not leave him any choice. A balanced look at high powered diplomacy that had gone mad."
4,Impressive and well-documented book,"It was frightening to live through the Cuban Missile Crisis. I was a little kid but still recall how scared and tense my parents and teachers were: an all-pervasive feeling of dread. I'm sure today's children feel the same about 9-11-01, and in future years they may have memories about this September's tragedy similar to mine about those 13 days in 1962.Fursenko and Naftali have done an admirable and thorough job detailing the rise of Castro and Cuban-American-Soviet relations during that period. It was overdue, since classics such as Graham Allison's Essence of Decision did not have the benefit of access to Soviet archives. The one criticism I have is that the authors almost overwhelm you with facts at the expense of interpretation. I didn't, for example, get a good sense of exactly why Fidel threw his lot in with the Soviets back in '60 when it was clear Moscow intended to keep Cuba going as a sugar colony--only at less than world prices!(...)"
4,Where Am I Going,The Song Where Am I Going could be the best song Gino Vannelli ever recorded what a masterpiece
5,Great CD,"This CD is wonderful, it's just like the old album we had years ago. Love it and if you know anything about Gino Vannelli, Get this!!! You won't be sorry!"
5,Great Balladeer,"Gino Vanelli was arguably the best male Jazz Balladeer of the mid-to-late 1970's. This particular album is my favorite of that era. He and brother Joe (a very under-rated keyboardist back then...before Yanni blew up, there was Joe Vanelli) had an incredible mix of Rock & Jazz. Also, check the engineering mix on this one when you buy it. Excellent vocal & instrumental clarity."
5,This is a representation of Rap Chicano style!,"This is a very good cd, it represents the talent out here in San Diego. We are keeping up with the big dogs of the rap industry. So check it out if you like rap and see how we do it SD style!"
5,superb,"This is an album for the ages, defining and owning one genre once and for all. This is art-rock at its best."
4,Tin Drum Review,Tin Drum has been classified as the pinnacle of Japan's career. Despite of a short career for a mainstream band is without a doubt a colorful album that clearly defines this era. This album has wonderful rythms that will take you back to the height of British bands in the early 80's. David Sylvian's voice is without a doubt what made this band so succesful.I prefer Gentleman Take Polaroids to Tin Drum because of personal reasons; this reasons are purely my own. I love Tin Drum but not as much as the other albums produced by the band. Tin Drum is easy listening not a dance album and will take you back to your teenage years or it will help you rediscover your past.
4,Remastered NOT Expanded,"Amazon's product description listed this cd as having the 4 bonus tracks on it. Well, I just received my copy and it does not. That sucks because the single version of ""the art of parties"" is superior to the album version. Oh well. At least it is remastered. I also bought ""Gentlemen take polaroids"" and ""Quiet Life"" and they did match the descriptions."
4,"May be a bit dated now, but cutting edge then","Ghosts still holds up very well, and This is a good ""Japan Album"" if you want to be aquainted with the spectrum of their work. David Sylvian's fan's may like it, as will Mick Karn listeners. Sample it on line if you can, if it tickles your ear, buy it."
4,Fat juicy guitar playin',"I finally bought this album the other day because after hearing so much from fellow guitar players about Wes' style. I can't believe I haven't picked this up before now! These tracks are mostly pop standards, and while the musicianship is top notch, it makes me hunger to hear his live material, if only to listen to his improvisational skills.At times it can sound dangerously close to elevator music, but there is little to be done about that. Its tragic that his life was so short, that he couldn't be allowed to go in whatever direction he wanted.All in all, this is serves me as a great introduction to his work, and will push me into buying more."
2,Not His best!,I was disappointed with most of the songs on this album. Not really his best songs. There are better albums out there.
3,"Slightly ""slick""","This compilation is nice enough (of course, wes didn't do much nonsense), but it gets slightly slick, especially toward the end. I don't know if this is due to the recordings beeing selected from the newest recordings... I had the same feeling about the Joan Baez ""Greatest hits"" from the same label.K"
2,Beautiful but broken.,"I agree with the other reviewer -- the packaging is terrible (each glass was simply wrapped in a sheet of paper). Two of our four glasses arrived broken, and they were shipped with other glasses that all arrived intact. If you buy these via mail order, you're likely buying the hassle of a return.That said, these glasses were the least expensive of those that we ordered and were much nicer than the others. If I could find them locally at this price ($19.99), I'd grab all I can. They're elegant, well made and the perfect size for general usage.EDIT: Received prompt replacements from Amazon -- one out of the four replacements was broken, but at least we now have a full set."
1,Not packaged well or not properly handled,"I ordered this lovely wine glass set, as a gift to my sister.When they arrived one of the stems was broken. Not a big deal,I set them back.I then had them replaced with the same set of wine glasses. Once again one of the stems was broken. I was reimbursed for the wine glass set. It was a big pain and disappointing. We never got to enjoy them. I'm not sure if it was bad packaging or miss properly handling."
3,Shattered glasses,"I had been hunting all over for these glasses to replace the ones broken in my existing set. Sadly, when I received them two were broken due to insufficient and inadequate packaging and shipment. The glasses were badly handled to say the least and I was extremely disappointed. On request of a refund I was only refunded the amount of one glass and when I followed this up with the seller requesting payment for two glasses and shipment, I did not get a response!! Please, if anyone knows where I can get another set of these lovely glasses please contact me. I would love to once again have a full set."
2,Not what I expected - may be fine for someone else,I did not expect a book with nothing but stickers and no associated activites to challenge the child who was receiving the book. I guess there are those who collect stickers who might be interested in having this.
2,Not impressive,"Although it is cheaper and works most of the time, I have three complains: 1) the transparent cover causes distraction, since the light blinks all the time in front of you; 2) internet is lost intermittently, I have to unplug and then plug again, or disable and then enable network to get internet connection again; 3) the size could be smaller."
1,"Doesn't work, its a lemon","I bought this hoping to get an easy & cheap ($3+shipping) fix for a broken ethernet port. At first it appeared to work, it installed and even connected but I could not connect to the internet or other computers on the network. I had to move it between 2 computers and 2 networks to figure out that though it installed and ""connected"", it wasn't really working. Whats worse, it was cheap to buy, so I'm not sure if its worth the return shipping charge to get my 3 bucks back.Spend a little more now buying a more expensive branded UBS-ethernet adapter like I had to (I bought something similar from Trendnet) and save yourself some heartburn."
2,Did Not Work for TiVo,"I have two TiVo Series 2 boxes and wanted them to talk to each other and the internet, without using wireless. Even with the latest TiVo software, some adapters will work, and others won't. This one DID NOT work.If you want an inexpensive USB to Ethernet adapter that WILL work with TiVo, try the Trendnet TU-ET100C, instead."
3,"Fast deliver, Item works with PC","Quick delivery, easy to install, works on PC with Win XP and Vista. However, it's not compatible with Wii. Should have done more research beforehand. My own mistake. Aside from that, the item is packaged nicely, delivered on time, and works as advertised. Will buy from this seller again."
1,I would give it a better score but...,"Well I am sure this product would work find if I could get the driver to work....it comes in one of those mini cds and I have a Dell XPS M1330. The CD drive for the computer is similar to the mac book where the thing doesnt pop out, you just slide the disc in through a slot. But it is a mini cd so it doesnt work with my computer. Just thought I would let you know"
2,only works if it stays plugged into port,"If your usb slot/port is vertical, you may have trouble with this. Because of the adapters bulkiness, combined with the weight of the cable you plug into it, the adapter keeps loosening from the usb port."
4,Works well in Linux,"Just plugged it in, turned on my computer, and away it went. OpenSUSE 11.4 picked it right up with the appropriate driver, and I was able to configure it in nothing flat. So far so good."
2,Not for me,"I did however receive a refund. the manager was polite to refundThe windows xp/2003 driver will work in Windows7;but a slow connection was my computer outcome.this little devise is 0nly for to connect,. .it does work but, it will mostly not exceed 60kb sec speed.thank you"
2,Not Agiler brand / Driver confusion,"The one I recieved buying from this listing is not an Agiler, it's a no-name brand. It has a number LK-2101 on a sticker in a package with no brand name.The driver disk has drivers for various items that have other numbers, I can't tell which corresponds to the ""LK-2101"" I received or the Agiler AGI-1108 that it seemed I was buying.So far, it's a pain. Let's see if I can get it installed, right now I'm trying to install the driver for the SR9600, whatever that is, that came on this disk, but I have no confidence that it's even the correct one for this item. There are also drivers for JP-1081 and and AX8872. None are certified, of course, but which is correct for an LK-2101?-------OK, through trial and error, I found that this LK-2101 they sent me works with the disk's ""JP-1081"" driver in XP. It does seem to work.I'm still not very happy with the misrepresentation."
2,USB 2.0 it is NOT,"You get what you pay for. I bought this device and used it. No problems except speed - it is definitely NOT USB 2.0. Its speed is very slow. I used it to copy a 100Mb file, and it took several minutes to finish. Copying the same size file with my new D-Link Ethernet/USB device finished in 15 seconds."
5,USB To RJ45,"This was the fastest way to fix my laptop when the network card went bad, Speeds never changed and now i can check all my friends laptops to see if their network card went out or if they have other issues. The fit isn't as tight as i would like to see but it still works fine!! Adapter comes with a disk to turn your 2.0 USB into a nick card. VERY NICE!!!"
3,Good for the Money,"This adapter isn't bad. I had some issues installing the drivers, but once I ran the install with the adapter unplugged and then plugged it in, it took off just fine. The only issues are it can be unreliable. It gets hot to the touch and loses internet, you must unplug it. Let it cool off. Plug it back in and back on the net you go. But for 3 dollars? not bad at all."
1,Cute but didn't work,"And I had a computer professional doing it. It would not install from the mini-disk but I had the driver already downloaded just in case. We never got to internet access. Finally, I routed around and found a new NID that I forgot I had and he installed that in 2 minutes and I had internet again. Waste of money."
1,FAKE CD,I dont even know if it works becuase the CD they sent me with the driver installation isnt even a real CD. Its like half the size. So now I have to buy an CD adapter for my USB adapter. Piontless. Spend a lilttle more and get a real one.
1,Did not work!,"I tried to use this with my chromebook cr-48 after reading that it might work. I ordered from Wowparts and it came pretty fast and in its retail packaging so it was legit. However when I tried to use it, it wouldn't work. I tried it on my chromebook, tablet, windows 7 laptop, windows vista desktop, linux laptop, and windows xp desktop. It worked on none of the computers because there were no drivers for it. The cr-48 doesn't need drivers and neither does the laptop but both of them wouldn't recognize the device even though it was being powered by the computers.I got a refund and didn't have to send it back in. Good customer service for a bad product. It's not the reseller's fault but rather the manufacturer's."
3,Worked excellent but ONLY on XP,"i tried for days to get this to work on vista. it just doesn't. i'm not going to the extent of re-writing driver files to make a usb adapter work... i haven't done that since a usr 56k modem... no thanks :)if you are running windows xp and plan no future upgrades, this adapter works excellent. keep your driver disc, even sp3 didn't know the driver."
3,Complete personal product review,"This is a cheap way to connect an Ethernet cable into a USB port.1) This item is made in China and the package looks like something you find in a 99 cent store, so there is no costumer service.2) The driver disc that comes with this adapter and is needed to be installed before your computer recognizes the device is a MINI-DISC, not the standard size compact disc so be prepared for that.3) This adapter DOES work just fine for me on my Sony Vaio Laptop that has no Ethernet connection ports, only two USB ports so I received exactly what I wanted and paid about $3.50 + S&H; for.Caution: My only set back with this adapter is that it gets extremely hot. Not hot enough to burn you on contact but it is uncomfortably hot and I would not leave it plugged in longer than I needed to."
4,it works,"Netbooks do not seem to have cat5 port, so for when you travel and they only offer a cable in the room, this saves the day!"
3,"Looks good, but quality not too great",The title says it all really. Quality is not the greatest. Haven't got anything else good or bad to say about it hence 3 stars.
3,"adorable, but not well made","The box arrived looking like it had been handled by bears. Everything was in good condition, so I put it together only to find at the end of assembly that the frame is so warped that the table is not level. GRRRR! (in keeping with the whole bear thing) Now I have to disassemble the #$%&* thing, repackage it in the shredded box and bother with a return. I will try one more time, but if the replacement is defective, I'm sending dead salmon to the manufacturer!Update: I got a replacement in an amazon-ingly short time! The second box was in better condition, and while not perfectly made, I was able to make it work."
5,Almost his best work,"I have to say that this is one of my all time favourite Mike Oldfield albums, eclipsing Tubular Bells 3, Incantations and almost beating Crises to my all time favourite, but believe me, it is a very very close second. Smooth melodies, guarenteed toe-tapping and guarenteed to make most people ask ""Who is this"" and then asking to borrow it (No you can`t, it`s mine :) ) Best tracks : Taurus 1, Arrival, Wonderful Land and QE2. If you like any other Mike Oldfield music, you will love this."
4,An Almost Lost Classic Refound,"I've been a Mike Oldfield fan for years - my LP (yes LP!) wore out, and the cassette version (yes cassette!) died as well. I despaired of getting a decent CD version until I recently came across a gently used version from the 90's. For a while, I delayed....who wanted to spend $75 for a lost recording? I had the good luck to find my recent copy for under $20, and it was worth the wait and the cost. When Mike decides to re-release it with enhanced sound, I'll be in line to buy it again, but for now, I enjoy what I first heard so many years ago. It's one of his master works, and since it is one of the earlier attempts, one hears harbingers of many of the mixes and techniques that would be refined to make the best of his best in later albums. If you've ever heard an album of his, you'll want to add this to your collection. (Not a 5 star because the existing CD needs the magic of remixing to be really enjoyed on modern equipment.)"
3,tragicomic? neither tragic nor comic...,"I finally understand what reviews mean by ""a whirlwind read""!You'll finish this petite novel quickly, and, if your taste is anything like mine, think good riddance. The writing is interesting and fresh, the dialogue quirky, but some facets of both main characters are glaringly overplayed and the epithets used to describe them are more than a little repetitive. Plot, however, is the real failing of the novel...is this a love story? A half-effort insider's view of Hollywood? A comedy? Does the author himself know? No, no, no, and no.I'll have to take a look at other novels by Griffin, if they exist, to determine if he develops his sparse bits of ingenious writing into a book worth reading...in the meantime, skip this one!"
3,nothing but feathers,"The description of the pillows should read: king size fowl feathers...might be some down in there somewhere. The filler tag reads ""95% feather and 5% down"". The pillows feel like nothing but feathers, really just the quills. I wouldn't recommend them for primary top pillows, maybe just for decoration."
2,Not what I thought,I've never had goose down pillows before so I wasn't sure what to expect. These are nice pillows if you don't mind a flat pillow but I like a nice big head pillow so my neck isn't kinked when I sleep.
1,Crunchy,"We hate these pillows.Very crunchy feathers. Nothing luxurious about that. My husband complained and I had to get our old down pillows back from storage. I'm surprised how many more positive reviews I read, I can't imagine anyone feeling comfortable with these pillows."
3,Just OK,"I bought these thinking they would be really fancy. They are fine, but they're really just kind of nice pillows. Nothing to write home about. They are not any better than what I was already using. Still, there is nothing wrong w/ these pillow either. But, you could do better on price for a pretty average pillow. If you're looking for something really special, this is not it."
2,I think rather than....,"'ll Be too mesmerized cleared, flat than I thought I'd lie down.Main bed head cushion pillow rather than as a substitute for money."
5,great pillows!,"i purchased these recently for a Christmas present and they arrived so fast! i haven't given them yet, but from what i've seen these were so worth it, softer than i'd hoped for! i know she'll love them."
5,Great Service and Product!,"I was very satisfied with the service provided. The company is very reliable and fast. Most of all, the product is what they claim to be - no more, or no less."
5,Great Comfort,I work in Iraq and it is hard to find comfortable pillows at the PX. I ordered these and am extremely pleased with the quality and comfort. Now I no longer wake up with a sore neck!
3,Like it,"I've enjoyed sleeping on these pillows, they have not flattened at all with months of use. They are a true king size so keep that in mind if you're thinking o fusing with a queen set."
5,Awesome pillows,Better than the all feather polo pillows that are double the price. These pillows have given much more comfort Than I thought they would. Very impressed
3,Noisy,"Bought these because of high ratings, BUT the pillows have a ticking on them that feels like plastic and makes noise when i move my head on them. DO not like that. Looking for new ticking to recover these things."
3,OK pillows,You get what you pay for. These pillows are pretty flat and are 5% down and 95% goose feather. I'll pay more for a better pillow that has fuller stuffing and more down.
2,very comfortable very neck pain!!!!,Actually i don't understand what is going on im not suffering from any neck or back pain and this pillow is very soft and comfort but after using it i wake up every day with a neck pain!!and now after a week of using this pillow i have a strong neck and back pain!!! Will not use it again i gave it 2 stars because of its softness
4,an improvement,"Do not fool yourself- these are not the best pillows a billionaire could buy.If you like a flat-ish pillow for side or stomach sleepers, they are good. I am happy with them, a big improvement over a 5 dollar pillow. Good value overall."
4,Comfortable but noisy!,"Comfortable--I've used a feather pillow forever. But, the fabric covering sort of ""crackles""."" Maybe this will go away with use and is no big deal."
5,awesome,"the pillows are nice and plush, i actually 2 sets of these (4 pillows) and i am glad i did. i have never felt anything more comfortable, especially for the price i paid....."
4,PILLOWS,THIS WAS A CHRISTMAS PRESENT FOR A FRIEND. THEY SAID THE PRODUCT WAS VERY NICELY MADE & IS VERY COMFORTABLE.
4,Great pillows,"These pillows feel great. Through a mistake, I got lucky. They actually sent me King-sized pillows instead of the Queen-size that I ordered. I was going to exchange them because they stick out of the ends of my pillowcases. Instead, I shook the goose feathers down to one end, folded and stitched back about 6-inches of the pillow to shorten them, now they feel a lot better than any Queen-sized pillow that I could have bought. Imagine, a Queen-size pillow with more feathers. Good stuff! :o)"
2,Not impressed,"I have owned these for a year now and since day one they flatten into hard rocks when you lay your head on them. This is truly a ""you get what you pay for"" item."
1,"Where did these feathers come from, a Pterodactyl?","I know, I know, you get what you pay for, but based on the reviews, I figured I would give these pillows a try. Never even took them out of the bag- stuck my hand down into the bag to see what they felt like- and felt this harshly bumpy mass. Could not imagine sleeping on these. Had to pay $10+ to ship them back! BUYER BEWARE... spend the money and get a much better pillow somewhere else!"
3,Unless you plan on using both to sleep with,"These pillows feel good, as long as you can keep the feathers under your head. I got these in the mail yesterday. I couldn't wait to sleep with it, as I love the feel of a new down pillow. I laid down with one and my head went straight through it. Lay down with both and the feathers still go off to the side leaving little cushion. So, I kicked them off my bed and grabbed my old pillows and put them back on. I am still on the search for my perfect pillow because this is not it."
5,A present for a friend,so I have a pillow when I go to her house.They are VERY nice. I recommend them.And even the bag they come in is versatile!
3,Average,Over produced... Karen's vocals are not out front vs the music. Two songs are subpar & shouldn't have been included.
4,Still missing Karen,"I think might have been the final release that Richard couold cobble together of unreleased material. Makes for an uneven sonic landscape, but with Karen's vocals, its still a great CD. Still an under-appreciated singer, so for those of us who remember her silky vocals and enjoyed them - i suggest you pick this up, as there has yet to be another singer to replace her....."
1,incorrect product shipped,List of Lights and buoys was shipped instead ofLovelines (Purchased on 07/24/2010)by Carpenters
3,Pop-rock,"What a waste of Karen Carpenter's absolutely gorgeous voice. Pop-rock, remix, doowah, honky-tonk sax...Richard should have just let the woman sing. Every piece is the same. Only the last cut is memorable. What a waste."
3,Get Karen's Solo CD instead.,"All of the songs are well-mixed and produced, as only Richard Carpenter could do it. However, this collection of songs is sleepy, even for the Carpenters. Four of the tracks are from Karen's solo CD, which is much more interesting and upbeat. I suggest buying KAREN CARPENTER instead."
1,Lovelines falls short of taste.,"To celebrate the 20 year anniversary with A&M in 1989, Richard released another album filled with more ""outtakes"" and songs from Karen's 1979 solo album. The best songs on the album are ""Where Do I Go from Here,"" ""When I Fall in Love,"" ""Kiss Me the Way You Did Last Night"" and the two singles, ""If I Had You"", and ""You're the One."" The others are not worth remembering, except for the catchy tune ""Slow Dance."" The album is clearly not one of the group's better ones, but Karen's matchless voice does still seem as beautiful as ever."
4,Definitely Steve Hackett,"One of Steve's better albums. You can tell how he influenced Genesis with his guitar work on this one, and still hear how he has continued to expand his own style to reflect no one but himself. A great album, I would recommend to anyone who is interested in Hackett's music."
3,Cheever Still An Enigma,"As a memoir of a daughter's relationship with her father, this is very touching, but there is little here that sheds much light on John Cheever, the writer. Given the various levels of family dysfunction and unhappiness in Cheever's stories and novels, it is gratifying that his daughter found so much to love in her father. For a more abrasive, but still admiring view of the man, you might also enjoy reading Benjamin Cheever's novel, The Plagiarist."
3,Excellent Memoir/Bio,"Though this is a biography of John Cheever by his daughter, it reads like a memoir. What is so amazing about this book is that Susan Cheever, can be so clear-eyed about her dad, while still clearly loving him, despite all his foibles. Very sensitively done with fine writing."
3,More John Cheever please; less Susan Cheever,"This would have been a better book if Susan Cheever had more to write about. For example, she could have delved more into the business of his writing, how much money he made, or his friendships with other writers. A little bit of research wouldn't have hurt. This is a very slight book. Also, I could care to know less about Susan Cheever; i.e. how she had been the source of some of John's stories...."
1,Boring,"I bought this after reading The Journals of John Cheever (which is an incredible book.) What I was most struck by after reading Ms. Cheever's book, was that her father was a true writer, and she is not. Her book was boring, predictable, and shed no real new light on her father's personality. His journals are raw, real, and intimate. Her recollections are alienated and just plain boring. Sorry, but I was hoping for an interesting read, and this wasn't it."
5,One of the best books for learning to draw,"This book explains how to draw. After you read ""Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain"" and understand that anyone who can sign their name can learn to draw, this book will help you learn. After good instruction, you are given practical exercises.Only critcism: figure drawing is mentioned in the beginning but there are no such exercises in the second half of the book."
3,12 or 1?,"The product description says that there are ""12 per clip strip"" does anyone know if there are actually 12? I highly doubt it. Please let me know."
2,Poor quality,"The reflectors are of very poor quality. They are not properly aligned and seem broken inside! The black framing is very thick and it does not bend to be applied on a curved surface for eg, a helmet!"
5,Jet dry is great,and even better was the price and convenience size. These are just so expensive in the store. It was nice to get a deal.
5,Does exactly what it's supposed to,"If you use a dishwasher you need a product that prevents water spots, and this does just that. It's a very good product, and my only complaint is that it is not inexpensive at the store."
5,Spot Free,"It drives me crazy when I open my dishwasher and find water floating on top of my tupperware and other plastic dishes. Finish Jet-Dry makes a huge difference and that is why I will continue to purchase Jet Dry.When I forget to fill my little 'jet dry holder' in the dish washer I notice a huge difference in my dishes so it's worth keeping some of this on hand at all times, it's worth the price."
1,Price does not add up,"Amazon states that this product is a pack of 3- 4.22oz bottles. This comes to a total of 12.66 oz for over $13 yet the site also states that this price is $.35/oz. It's actually more than $1 an oz! This does not add up and is not a good deal. I typically take Amazon for it's word and move quickly through the site purchasing what looks like a good deal. This however, did not take long to do the math and realize that it is not adding up. I hope that it is an oversight and not Amazon trying to pull the wool over on anyone."
4,Can't wash dishes without it.,"Well, I can, but there would be spots on my wine glasses, and who wants to think about spots when they're getting their wine on? Not me."
5,Horizon Will Never Fade,"OKay, I admit it: I'm a sucker for love songs, especially those with a darker, melancholy undertone. The fact that this was Karen's specialty made me instantly fall in love with her voice and song interpretations. Nowhere is that more evident than on 1975's ""Horizon"". With the exception of the worldwide smash, ""Please Mr. Postman"", and ""Happy"" this album remains darker in nature and a supreme showcase for Richard's chillingly perfect arrangements & Karen's heartfelt vocals (By the way, that's Karen doing the drum work on ""POstman!"" She rocked!) This album marked a stronger, more mature offering from the best pop duo ever, and even minor Carpenters fans should own the remarkable ""Horizon""."
4,The last time Karen's voice would sound so good.....,"Horizon is the final album in which Karen's vocals would sound so stunning. Her warm, gorgeous voice glows in this album, too bad the LP was so short. They toured so much and it seems there was not more time for studio work. Her voice never sounded the same after 1975. I do love this LP, yes it is melancholy to a degree, but so is life."
5,Code Blue,"Code BlueA well packed CD that arrived quickly from overseas. It was in perfect condition and extremely cheap, not nasty. I'm impressed!"
3,"Excellent Mouse, works great","I have been using this for almost 2 years now. It fits great in my medium sized hands. The weight is perfect for long use.I unplug it from pc and take it to work almost every day.Con : I get annoyed by other mouse now since i started using this mouseUpdate, i had to fix the cable by cutting it, but that's no problem because it was under heavy use. The right-click button stopped with the clicking sounds and doesn't work so great anymore. I've never had this issue with another mouse. same thing happened to a friends razer diamondback. shame because i really liked the size and design"
1,Absolutely disappointed,"My mouse had always been logitech, now I bough this for a change and I am very disappointed.First the software have a lot of problems detecting the mouse etc, when I turn off the computer and I turn it on again, I have to unplug it and plug it again, if not, I cant use the mouse.So stay with logitech, I have this mouse since 5 days and I want a g5 already."
5,Favorite mouse ever !!,"The perfect gaming mouse, so sad that after 2 years it finally broke and I got to get another the wheel snapped but I have hundreds and hundreds of gaming hours in this mouse I absolutely love it =)"
1,Do NOT buy this mouse!!!!,"I concur with the reviewer who wrote the ""Microsoft Magic"" review. Right out of the box you are presented with two different install approaches. Install drivers first...don't install drivers first. Damned if you do, damned if you don't. Then lets move onto the frustrating task of flashing the firmware. After that, installing the updated drivers that appear to be the same old drivers. Then the Razor configurator program that will never appear. Ever. After 2 days I gave up and dragged out my old reliable laser mouse. Logitech, here I come."
1,Had two of these fail... DO NOT BUY,"DO NOT BUY A RAZER - YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!Within a year of use, I had my first one fail. It would periodically disconnect from being seen by the computer and then reconnect but respond choppily.I purchased a second one because the first was just outside of warrantee range. Within a year it was doing the same as the first but when I went to send it to Razer, I read that their warrantee is only good if you have the original packaging it came in and the receipt.Back when I bought these they were 70 to 80 bucks each. All wasted.If you want a good mouse, go with something like a DeathAdder (pure Razer, no MicroSoft involvement) or a Cyborg RAT 7 and keep your original packaging and receipt!"
2,Microsoft Habu Gaming Mouse,"After receiving the mouse I found that it was very wide in my hand. Also, I couldn't get the Vista drivers for supporting it for 64bit OS. I found the click buttons to be very stiff when dpressing them (not very precise). Final thoughts: I have been using a Logitech G5 for the last year and had high expectations for the Microsoft Habu. It just doesn't stand up to the Logitech G5 (at all!). I put the Habu in a drawer where it will remain until I sell it at a garage sell. But Logitech--Way Better for gaming..."
2,"Not bad, besides the doubleclicking",I have owned this mouse for about 6 months now and have played plenty of games on it. Overall the construction is great except the feet have started to come off on the edges (and yes I DO use an adequately sized mouse pad). There is no sidescrolling on the wheel which is another minus for me. My main problem is that the mouse has recently developed a double-clicking issue where I click only once yet the mouse outputs two clicks. Needless to say this is extremely annoying and intolerable on any mouse. Yes I do play a lot of games where clicking is required but my Logitech G5 has lasted around 2 years now and is still going strong.In my experience Microsoft mice always junk out after a couple months... My advice is to get a Logitech instead.
4,Good but be careful,"I had this month little over a month and I loved it, it was comfortable, stylish, good precision... until it broke. For some reason these mice have a hardware problem that causes them to double click after a period of use. I called Microsoft support and after a few email exchanges and they informed me the the Habu had been discontinued and they were replacing them with Microsoft Sidewinder X5s.... and I hate that mouse because it feels like a cheap piece of crap...So in short, very good mouse until it breaks... then... you're stuck w/ a cheap sidewinder : /"
2,Great mouse but SO many issues with software,"1st 2 weeks it worked great, excellent weight balance, sumer smooth, all you can ask for. After that it started to randomly turn on and off. I havent found a way to fix it yet, i have another mouse connected that im using and i just see Habu turn on and off all day. It seems like the issue when you reset and you have to unplug and plug again but this issue is different, and of course if you go to microsoft they direct link you to razer and in razer the only support is the firmware/driver update that i already did and didn't work at all. I tried a few forums, and emailing razer support 1 month ago, and still no answer."
4,Habu Mouse,"I like the size and shape very well. The programmable buttons make this mouse good for most apps. The 'always' on feature is great for my games, response is very good . I would buy it again and on Amazon the price was excellent."
2,Cord failure,"I bought a wired mouse because I wanted it to just work. Now two years later the cord is failing. It cuts in and out, and wiggling it affects it. What a waste of money. Not what I expected in a high end gaming mouse. The only reason it gets two stars is because it looks cool, is comfortable, and worked well for over a year."
3,Not too bad!,"How do you follow a classic like ""Back in Black""? You can't,but AC/DC gives it a good shot.For those about to rock (we salute you) is by far the best song on the album.Most of the other songs are pretty faceless,but they are interesting enough to hold your interest through the whole album."
4,FOR THOSE ABOUT TO ROCK,"Another excellent album from the legendary AC/DC. The highlights are FOR THOSE ABOUT TO ROCK (WE SALUTE YOU), PUT THE FINGER ON YOU, LET'S GET IT UP, INJECT & C.O.D. The rest of the album is good also. This was their second album with Brian Johnson."
4,LAST ONE,"Indepedent of the quality of the tunes, and independent of having Brian Johnson on it, I consider it the last AC/DC album to possess, at least, an AC/DC ""feeling"" around it. It is the last one with producer Mutt Lange. Its has come solid tracks, liek the tille, PUT THE FINGER ON YOU, EVIL WALKS and LET'S GET IT UP. I just wonder if they had a better singer replacing Scott ..."
5,how can you not like it?,"If you get this album and don't like it, I can't help you. Admittedly, its not quite as good as Back in Black, but it's still a classic and very underrarted. Mutt Lange's production touch ( very much missed on later albums) is fabulous here. Some highlights are, title track,i put the finger on you, let's get it up, inject the venom, snowballed, n.o.t.l.k. don't buy this as your first acdc album, but once you get into them buy it immediately."
5,AN UNDER-RATED CLASSIC,"This is under-rated!, and i don't understand why, it's a classic album that features (for those about to rock) and many others, i strongly encourage you to give it a listen, you'll be glad you did. Highly recommended."
3,"Good, but not brillant","I don't mind this album, but ita a tad overrated and I find that 'flick of the switch' give me more enjoyment. More sedate than Back in black, I think the Young brothers were trying new sounds but with mediocre sucess. The title track, Spellbound,Lets get it up, Snowballed and Evil walks are good songs, but the rest are pretty ordinary and lacklustre. Dissapointing!"
3,Great Title Track...,Great Title Track for a rock anthem and AC/DC does it well...rest of album strong and carries the rock message and party theme to go get wild..
5,My first AC/DC Album,"This was my first AC/DC album and I had previously heard the beastly title track ""For Those About to Rock"" and a few other AC/DC songs. I found myself getting addicted to my small collection of random AC/DC songs so I wanted to hear more, especially their biggest album and the 4th best-selling rock'n'roll album of all time - ""Back in Black"". So me and my girlfriend went to Sam Goody, but all ""Back In Black"" was sold out , so I picked this bad boy up. It blew me away, like I said, the title track left me awestruck when i heard it on my stereo. This is definitely the best possible successor to ""Back in Black"", with ""Inject Venom"" ""C.O.D."" ""Evil Walks"" ""Let's Get It Up"" and ""Night of the Long Knives"". I saw the video of AC/DC playing ""For Those About to Rock"" live, and Angus's performance and the cannons totally amazed me. Rock on and buy this awesome album."
5,Excellent Album,I think this is probably my favorite ACDC album. It's in the same vein as Back in Black I think. And one of the reasons I like this album so much is it didn't get as much play as Back in Black did. You know how you get tired of the most popular music sometimes because you've heard it so much?I LOVE this album........:)
4,Brian Johnson Proves Himself Again,"People bought ""Back in Black"" with the mindset that it was not going to be anything good because Bon died... everyone thought AC/DC was dead and not coming back. Brian Johnson proved them wrong, giving them the best-selling album of their career. Now, Johnson proved that he could make a fan out of people who had a low opinion of the band. However, with this album, he had to face the pressure of not disappointing his fans. He pulled it off. He did it. This album is the last GREAT album that AC/DC ever did. It kicks off with one of my favorite tunes by them of all time, and continues with the catchy ""I Put the Finger On You"". In fact, every song up until ""Evil Walks"" is PURE GOLD! After ""Evil Walks"", it starts to lose its edge. But it is regained by ""Spellbound"". Johnson proves that he is an awesome singer. It is about as good a follow-up as can be expected to an album that sells 19 million copies. Props to Johnson on this one."
3,A good album,"Of the AC/DC studio recordings that I have heard, 1981's For Those About to Rock We Salute You is the one that I consider to be my favorite. It is consistent and satisfying from beginning to end--also, ten tracks are contained. The material sounds like straight-up rock to me. In addition, the musicianship is solid, and Brian Johnson does not disappoint in the vocal department, either. I enjoy his unique, gritty-sounding, high-energy vocals. ""For Those About to Rock (We Salute You),"" ""Let's Get It Up,"" and ""Night of the Long Knives"" are my preferential songs. Though the CD booklet does not include the song lyrics, it does contain an informative essay and various illustrations. The CD is just over 40 minutes, also. For Those About to Rock We Salute You is recommendable."
4,So What If It's Not Back In Black,"This is a great album from beginning to end. It also represents some of Brian Johnson's best work with the band. The popular title song, is a true classic. But it's the consistancy of great songs like Let's Get It Up, C.O.D., Evil Walks, and Spellbound, throughout the album that make this a pleasure to listen to. If you're looking for another Back In Black, don't buy this. If you're looking for a great hard rock album, you can't go wrong with this one. I think AC/DC should be creditted for not making an album that sounded like Back In Black, rather than being criticized for it."
4,Second best AC/DC album,"FOR THOSE ABOUT TO ROCK (We Salute You) stands behind only Back In Black as the best of the AC/DC albums. Six of the 10 songs are Brian Johnson classics, the rest are mostly filler (while all 10 of the previous album are classic). Still, this a great collection of songs--I just replaced my 17 year old cassette with a new CD--crank it up and blast your neighbors!"
4,ac/dc we salute you,"for this great album its hard rock from start to endwhen the album opens up with a moody bigining of for those about to rock you know its going to rock as brian johnson screaches out the vocals to get to the climax of the cannon fire,its awsomei put the finger on you another great track snowballed is good too along with evil walks and c.o.d wich really gets into that dark side around hell aint a bad place to be,high way to hell ect.over all this is a great album often over shadowed by back in black,if you going to compare every ac/dc album to back in black your not going to get it this album rocks!great addition for ac/dc fans and anyones cd collection."
4,Stand up and be counted...,"For Those About to Rock gets a bad rap. People expected Back in Black 2 and that just wasn't going to happen. What they got, however, was an outstanding follow up to one of the greatest metal albums ever.This album is much edgier than back in Black, harkening back to the Highway to Hell days. The songs are heavier than Back in Black on the whole and have a much darker feel.The title track is a staple of AC/DC live shows to this day, unfortunately, because the overwhelming consensus is that this is a 'weaker' album, they don't do as many of the other tracks as they should. The lesser known tracks that are standouts from For Those About to Rock are Evil Walks, C.O.D., and Let's Get it Up.If you buy this with expectations, you may be disappointed. If you buy it and just take it at face value you will have discovered a gem that is often overlooked."
3,Not as Good,"For a grade, this effort deserves 60%. After listening for a bit, I knew which tracks I liked. Then, afterwards, I tried to go back to the ones I didn't care for--thinking that perhaps if I hear them enough I might change my mind. That was the not the case. The title track is as best as it gets during Brian's era, awesome. ""Put the Finger On You"" has a catchy intro, while ""C.O.D"" has that familiar evil-like connotation. ""Spellbound"" was a great way to end the album, a strong track along with ""Evil Walks."" For me, this was the weakest of the Johnson era-a heavy album but just some extremely repetitive chorus and lyrics."
4,"Yeah...It's Not ""Back In Black""!","I think that the main reason that this album is not looked at as a great AC/DC album is because people will not stop comparing it to Back In Black.Yes, Back In Black is one of the best rock albums ever recorded. Yes, Back In Black is by far AC/DC's best album ever.BUT....what you need to realize is that EVERY ALBUM AIN""T GONNA BE BACK IN BLACK! When a band has an extremly sucessful album like Back In Black, there is always an enormus amount of pressure to make the follow-up album just as good or better. And most always, it is not.With this album, however, I think that the band put together a solid ten-course rock n roll feast. The title song is one of their best, the cannons rule! Also Snowballed, COD and Evil Walks are good songs.So if you give this album the fair chance it deserves and listen to it without expecting Back In Black, you will like it, I PROMISE!"
3,"its ac/dc mach 2, what more do you want?","sorry guys, this is just another ac/dc album. outside of the title cut, nothing else on the album is classic. there are some good moments, but nothing that jumps out at you. it rocks along very dependably is about the best i can say. the songs are not witty like great ac/dc, in fact, some are pretty stupid. its only through the monolithic riffs of the youngs that keep the album from being rated lower. i wanted to rate this higher but in looking at the song listing i cant."
4,trust me you'll LIKE it...,but you might not love it. Don't compare it to Back In Black. FTATR stands on it's own because it is hard to follow a masterpiece with anything.And it is better than Flick Of the Switch.
4,AC/DC's Second Effort With Brian Johnson Packs A Punch!,"""For Those About To Rock"", released in 1981, is an album with a good rock and roll formula that works. It almost measures up to it's predecessor, ""Back In Black."" Brian Johnson's firey vocals keeps the listener's attention on the title track as well as ""Inject The Venom"" and ""C.O.D."" The whole remastering production is very nicely done. Still, ""Back In Black"" tops this one."
2,"eh, there are better","[...]I am a huge AC\DC fan, but if you are looking to get an album of theirs, get High Voltage or Back in Black instead.While the songs on this album are good, there is only one really worthy of recognition.High Voltage is a great album, and made doubly so by the fact it is a Scott album and has real vocals in it. Plus it has T.N.TBack in Black is their best album, but I would recomend High Voltage over it if you are getting into AC\DC because it is cheaper.In short, For those aboout to rock is one of theri best, but there are better. If anything the best AC\DC is in their DVD Live at Donnington."
3,AC/DC We Salute You,"CD was in great condition and got here quick. As it turned out, it is not one of my favorite AC/DC cd's. Not alot of good songs. Oh well..still adds to the collection."
3,Its okay just not their best.,This was a good album nothing more nothing less but if you want a really good Brian Johnson album that came out after Back In Black get Flick Of The Switch and Razors Edge.Both of those albums may have a song as popular as For Those About To Rock but they have more energy and better sonwriting.All I can see thats good about this album is the title track and some good choruses on some of the other songs like Inject The Venom and Spellbound.Other than that it is pretty mediocre but what would you expect it came out only a year later than Back In Black so it was kind of rushed.They put more effort into the third one that came out in 83.
1,bad sound,"im a album collector this company said, collectable, ha what a joke first song side 1... skiped and the sound on all other song really bad,plus the so called collectable had the previous owners lable sticker on the album lable her name was on both sides... my advice if you by vinyl online, buy new unused.......25$ collectable what a jokebought this thing from moneyblows.com..."
3,ACDC For Those About to Rock We Salute You,The title song is easily the best song on this album. Not saying the rest of the songs aren't good. AC/DC has the in you face rocknroll that people like and don't slow down the whole time.
5,Evil Walks,"This is a great album! True it didn't sell like Back In Black, but, no other album really has.. You gotta love ""Put the Finger On You"", ""Evil Walks"", ""C.O.D."", ""Inject the Venom"", ""Snowballed"" and you can't forget the title track which is one of the true great rock songs of all time!!! And a true rock and roll anthem!!! This is what rock and roll is all about!!! If you like AC/DC, you have to buy this album!!! Long Live AC/DC!!!"
5,GET IT UP!!,"This album is my all time favorite album!It's got what it takes to be a rocker!Back in Black will always have my favorite song(""HELLS BELLS""),BUT,this one's got alot of good tunes on it such as:""For those about to rock"",""Let's get it up"",""Inject the venom"",""Evil walks"",""C.O.D"",""Breaking the rules"",and my second favorite song ""SPELLBOUND.""If you're new to AC/DC get Back in Black,THEN get this one,or get em' both.Brians voice is great(like always),the Young Brothers have done it again,Phil Rudd's drumming is great,and Cliff's work is cool and heavy.Whats there more to say.....once you have this album and a hot chick with you,she WILL get it up!"
5,"ANGUS YOUNG IS VERY,VERY GOOD","ANGUS YOUNG IS A VERY,VERY,VERY,VERY GOOD GUITAR PLAYER AND THE SINGER IS REALLY,REALLY,REALLY,REALLY GOOD.THIS ALBUM IS A GEM FROM THE FIRST TO THE LAST TRACK.IT HAS SEVERAL GREAT SONGS LIKE THE TITLE SONG,INJECT THE VENOM,I PUT THE FINGER ON YOU AND NIGHT OF THE LONG KNIVES.VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."
4,Very Good by AC/DC's Standards,"Here is the follow-up to Back in Black. This was a huge success for the band at the time because people were expecting another Back in Black. This simply wasn't the case. Although it is a good album, it is just not as radio-friendly as Back in Black was. There are, however, many stand out tracks incl. For Those About to Rock..., Let's Get It Up, Evil Walks, C.O.D., Put The Finger On You. I especially like the opening riff to Night of the Long Knives. Anyway, this is not where to start, but also not where to finish. It is probably 2nd or 3rd best of the Brian Johnson era, and maybe 5th or 6th best total. Mutt Lange's production helps this one a lot, which was a problem suffered by many albums after this one."
5,"Superb Writing, Acting, Directing!","Of all the productions of Ms. Cookson's works, I think this is the very best. The cast was brilliant and the direction was sensitive and true to the book. I particularly appreciated the high-spirited nature of the leading character. Milquetoast is not on the menu here!Bravo to cast and crew. Ms. Cookson had to be most pleased."
3,$175 for 156 minutes? Get real,Enjoyable period piece but a shame that this movie is $175 - yes one hundred and seventy five dollars - USED. Someone trying to make a killing. Pass because of the outrageous price.
3,"Cute balls, not red like on the pic though, just light wood.","Cute balls, don't know if they work or not, but they are clean and perfectly round, so they look cute no mater where I'll put them"
2,Can't tell the difference,"NOt sure if it's working or not but can't tell there is lavender scent in them at all. A bit too small so now I'm afraid it might be a choking hazard for kids or if it accidentally drops out of my drawer, a slip waiting to happen."
2,MOTHS : I STILL HAVE THEM,"THE CEDAR BALLS HAD A VERY LITE SCENT, SO I TRIED SPRAYING THEM WITH CEDAR OIL TO REFRESH, BUTNEITHER DID MUCH TO RID ME OF CLOTHES MOTHS. I STILL HAVE THEM. I HAVE TRAPS WITH PHEREMONESIN THEM-THE TRAPS DO COLLECT A LOT OF MOTHS BUT I STILL HAVE THEM. I SAW ONE THIS MORNIGAND ONE THIS AFTERNOON-THEY APPEAR TO BE 'WEAK' IN THAT I CAN CATCH AND KILL THEM, BUT...I ALSO HAD ORKIN COME IN AND DRILL IN THECLOSETS IN THE EAVES AND INSERT A POISON I GUESSBUT I DON'T THINK IT DID THAT MUCH GOOD. I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. (IT IS TRUEI DISCOVERED TOO LATE WHERE THE FIRST SET OF MOTHS WERE BREEDING-IN MY WOOLENS. I SOMEHOWDID NOT KNOW WHAT TO LOOK FOR). I AM DISPIRITED AND VERY UPSET"
4,Cedar Fresh Home Products 24Ct Cedar/Laven Balls,Cedar Fresh Home Products 24Ct Cedar/Laven Balls came in with a very nice cedar smell that was not too over powering but enough that only two per draw were required for it to work.
1,Do not buy them !!,All what I'm gonna say is they have a very weak smellI put many of then inside one drawer for many days put I did not notice any thing
3,Not a lot of Scent,"Wanted to try these because of the lavender, but really could not smell much of anything. Tried closing them up in a small drawer but still didn't get a good strong scent from them. Maybe I got a bad batch?"
2,Nice cedar fragrance but,"Nice cedar fragrance, but the scent dissipates very quickly and one is left with little wooden balls for the fire place. Not worth the money"
5,Excellent Focus,"I just want to say ""Thanks!"" to the previous reviewers of this disc, or I never would have purchased it. I am a big Jan Akkerman fan, and the ""Con Proby"" album (no Akkerman; Philip Catherine on guitar, as on this disc) was a poor finale for such a fantastic band as Focus. So if not for the extremely positive reviews, I would not have given ""Live at the BBC"" a second thought.The two Catherine-penned pieces are my favorites (Sneezing Bull & Angel Wings), which reinforces Catherine's contribution to this lineup. Everything else is very good to great as well (just ignore Van Leer's ""vocals"" at the very beginning of the disc). The other reviewers have said it better than I can.If you are a fan of Focus, buy this disc."
5,Good bye Lenin,"Excellent review and inside to how it was living in East Germany, I grew up there and find the film very realistic. Excellent film und fun to watch!"
4,Neat Movie,This movie gave a lot of insight to the way that the East Germans were feeling that crazy time before the wall came down. For a few different generations.
5,Great movie!,"This is a great movie that shows the struggles that a young boy goes through to make his mother happy. She is in bed and does not know that communism is over and he tries to make her think that nothing has changed in their country-Germany. You will laugh a lot and if you have ever lived in a communist country, this movie will make you smile adn relate to all the familiar issues they faced. Great movie!!"
5,The fall of the wall and all new lives,"In this story a young man's mother has a heart attack, coincidently just before the collapse of the communism in the DDR. When she comes out of her coma East Germany is gone, swept into the dustbin of history, and along with it her status (for what it's worth) as a ""Hero"" of state socialism. To preserve her illusions and to prevent her fragile health from collapsing her son convinces friends and former coworkers to act as though the DDR goes on and contrives all sorts of elaborate ploys to make it appear as if the communsit state is still going on.A fun movie, if a little bittersweet."
5,"Great movie, great drama, great comedy :)","I am not German, yet there were such moving moments in the movie I was on the brink of tears, and there were also some scenes where u have the most innocent and ""justified"" laugh while there are still tears in your eyes. A must see movie."
3,"Welcome, German Cinema","An intelligent and compelling comedy (or dramedy), ""Good Bye Lenin"" presents an interesting portrait of the multiple changes that affected Germany a few years ago. Managing to offer a strong social/political/historical perspective about the evolution of his country, director Wolfgang Becker also delivers a solid character study about a youngster and his relationship with his mother, touching issues such as the generation gap or the power of a lie. The acting is good overall (Daniel Bruhl is very convincing), the directing is clever, the plot is gripping and the soundtrack (by Yann Tiersen) is superbly crafted, which makes for an above average cinematic experience.Recommended."
3,"Not what I expected, but still maintains to be good.","This was the first forgein i have bought, because i enjoyed the idea, i expected more dark comedy from it but was somewhat dissapointed but it is a very well put together film, this is a good renter to a moive connassuer or someone who is just trying out something new."
3,Not a fan,I found this to be kind of a useless book. I didn't learn much from it and it was very new-agey/touchy-feely.
3,Not the best from the eighties,"The best are QE2 and Five Miles Out.The introducing instrumental, the main compositon is so weak that I could'nt rate this CD more than a three.The pop songs are okay, but Taurus 3 is not that good.Just simply compare the title song to Taurus 2 on Five Miles Out. That one is far better I think.May be you'll like it. I did not."
4,Divided I stand,"First song, 20 minutes ""Crises"" is as good as ""Tubular bells"". The first 2 minutes are maybe a bit too new age but the rest is really uncredible especially the Watcher and the tower part. The great Admam Ant is playing guitar on this song.Song ""In high places"" is sang by Jon Anderson (I just can't resist him). I did not know it was Oldfield who did ""Shadow on the wall"", a song that I liked a lot back in early 80's. Well, it is on this album. ""Taurus"" is a excellent accoustic guitar piece.The 2 others songs are okay but I am not attracted to women's voice."
2,Moonlight Shadow is the only thing worth it...,"Moonlight Shadow is the only song that's good on this CD, just by Elements instead."
2,Same ol' print used by other companies,No better or no worse than that used by most other studios for release. If you wand a better print I recommend Cold Vengeance (AKA Dawn Rider) since the sound track modification is decent and the picture is much better.
4,"Excellent tent, one minor flaw.","We are extremely pleased with quality of our family tent. The build in electric light is wonderful, but almost too bright. The tent was easy to set up with color coded poles. While the spring action door was a neat trick, we preferred entering through the screen porch. The screen porch was a lifesaver due to the flies at El Prado Campground in San Diego County. My only complaint, and deserves losing a star over is the screen porch. It has no floor. We relied on a tarp to make up for the lack of flooring, but that still left a gap at the bottom of the screen. So, before our next camp out, I'm going to sew in a proper floor."
2,Darn Rain,"Just what I was looking for. After researching many tents I came across this one. It had many cool features and it was backed by Coleman's WeartherTec System(tm) ""Guaranteed to keep you dry"". I was impressed by their online claims that all tents were tested in a Rain Room and also in a Wind Room. The special features also included special ""leak-free"" seems to protect you from the elements. The tent worked great in dry weather. The first night it rained it leaked at virtually every seem. Even the door leaked at its' seems. With sleeping bags and pillows drenched we had to sleep in the car. We knew for sure the floor of the tent was water proof since we discovered in the morning that a small pool had accumulated inside. I had to drive 45 min. out to buy tarps. I really liked the tent, I just wish it where water proof."
1,"Wet, Wet, Wet.","We bought this tent last summer and used it one beautiful sunny weekend. It was great! Totally loved the tent. We used it a couple of months later on a not so nice weekend. It rained most of the 3 days and nights. We got very, very wet. The seams near the bottom are below the rain fly. water literally poured in along the seam. We woke up the first night to standing water inside the tent. All our clothes were wet, our sleeping bags were wet. It was bad! We had to cover the tent with a tarp and one of our freestanding canopies so we could make it through the trip. Even with this extra covering, it still leaked in at the few points we couldn't get secondary cover over. I packed it up and sent it back to Campmor where I bought it. They refunded the tent and the shipping. I've always liked Coleman. Maybe I just got a bad one. But I'll never rick it again. I'm getting a great Mountain Hardwear ten to replace it."
5,The standard reference for the intelligent light Canterbury,"Well it's inferior than the best of Zappa's stuff and that one of Isildur's Bane today as well, but it's the most influential of all the light/experimental Canterburian works...it maintains a great sense of measure, without the excess of certain experimental fusion French prog (in the vein of Art Zoyd or the experimental Magma or Dun for example); besides it has got an high reputation in the jazz canterburian circle of Canterbury (e.g. Matching Mole, Egg and National Health)and it is like ""In the court of the Crimson king"" by King Crimson as a prog fan's reference for the settlement of the first prog standard.""Mumps"" and ""Didn't matter anyway"" are classic gems by Dave Stewart, with a great keyboard work as well.Highly Recommended to the fan of the intelligent Canterbury (much better than the whole Caravan's stuff!!)"
1,Over priced shipping and defective,As a one-click shopper on Amazon I was shocked to see that Triathlete store.com charged me $7.95 for shipping. The belt was $7.95 and arrived in a shipping bag by Firtst-Calss Parcel Mail. Now to top off the outrageous price of $15.90 the belt arrived missing one snap. To return it means my time and additional shipping cost for a piece of elastic. No thanks I'll eat the $15.90 and never purchase from Triathlete Store.com again. I suggest you do the same.
5,Pure Rock-n-Roll music!!!,"This Soundtrack is loaded with pure, great rock songs and sounds from the movie ""Young Einstein"". The album features songs like ""Rock and Roll music""(great remix,same one you hear in the movie) ""Music goes round my head""-The Saints, ""Great Southern Land""-Icehouse. Yahoo Serious is hilarious and has some quotes from the movie within the album. Seriously, Yahoo should of been a bigger star after this film,he didn't seem to get much help after makeing ""Reckless Kelly"". If you've seen this movie as much as I have and wonder where to get this album-order it here because any retail store selling it new or used won't have it(most stores will say can't order it,probably cause it's an import from Australia and no longer made), yeah it's not a demanding cd to get, BUT GET THIS ONE!, it's hard to come by, I just recently received it from these guys here at amazon and I'm really happy with this cd. ""That's why I go for that Rock-n-roll music""!!!"
5,"If you don't get it, you won't get Australians","If you don't get it, you won't get Australians. I'm not kidding, the silliness and what is happening in the background appeals to us, plus it has an excellent soundtrack, well worth paying for, and also available on Amazon. The only sucky thing about this movie is that it has not been released in Australia on DVD. How does that make any SENSE? How dum is warner bros to not sell this movie to people that would appreciate, ie AUSTRALIANS. That being said, if your a yank hire it first, it may not appeal to you're sense of humour, and I would hate for you to waste your money, Canadians buy it, you'll get it."
1,Why was this movie ever made?,"Some corny movies I enjoy, but YOUNG EINSTEIN was probably one of the most intelligence-insulting, insipid, and irritating wastes of film ever created. The world's greatest genius trying to split Tasmanian beer atoms? Sure, that WOULD be funny if comedy experts like the Monty Python team got hold of this blatantly dumb movie. If you want to go out and rent what I can't even dignify by calling it a ""film,"" be warned: around an hour and a half of your life will be wasted as you try to understand why the supposedly witty humor and fine acting is totally nonexistent."
4,"Crazy, but I love it!","I love this show. My favorite scenes are where he discovers the 4/4 beat on the hopscotch grid, and at the end of the movie where the bird was bobbing up and down to the music. It was crazy, but I just loved it. Being the prude that I am, though, I could have done without the ""cheeky"" scene in the mad scientists ward of the insane assylum. Loved the music."
2,What the ???,"I wasn't expecting a whole lot out of MIMIC 2. After all, it was the direct-to-video sequel for a science fiction film that didn't do very well at the box office to begin with. However, even with my low expectations I was disappointed. The film started off well enough, having a minor character from the first film become the lead in this one. However, nothing exciting was done with the concept. Instead, the premise of the original was stretched as far as it would go beyond belief. The last remaining Judas bug knows its time is running out. So, it has to mate so the species will continue to survive. However, this bug evolved to the point where it adapted to mimic humans. Therefore, the only creature worthy of it mating with is a human. Get it? Pretty twisted, huh? Good. Now, don't waste your time watching this movie."
2,Can't mimic the success of the original,This dire direct to video sequel lacks the humor and chills which made the original so enjoyable. This time around the roaches (known as the Judas Breed) are able to take on an almost human form. It's up to hypochondriac biology teacher Remy (Alix Koromzay) along with a cop and 2 of her students to destroy them. The only problem is they are unarmed.MIMIC 2 is generally rather tedious and adds nothing new to the genre. The only other interesting twist is that Remy takes a polaroid of herself at the exact moment one of her relationships falls apart; and has these taped on her wall. The movies ending is a real cop-out. I've said it before and I'll say it again: Why do sequels like this keep getting made?
3,Return of the Judas Breed,"A school teacher is having trouble with men and giant cockroaches. There are a few scenes designed to make us believe she is the entomologist from the first movie (her book and she says ""we created them""). The bugs have targeted her. Maybe because she beat them before or maybe just because she smells good.Any man who comes near her becomes the target of a lone soldier that is trying to fulfil its life purpose of protecting its queen. This causes a run in with the police as well as allows the military to get wind of the situation.Military, police and school teacher converge to end the final threat from the Judas Breed. The ending is creepy and needs to be seen (I won't spoil it).Much different in style and feel than the original. No infestation, just a lone bug doing its best. Check it out."
2,mimic 2,"mimic 2 is a fast paced sequel, it does not explain itself well but considering many other sequels it is good enough. I was surprised to notice that it comes in just under 80 minutes!---if they could have stretched it to 90 minutes with more story details this would have been rated higher. I was not bored like some reviews previously but I definetly EXPECTED MORE from this movie. the extras on the dvd were very interesting. bottom line: rent it and curl up with your boyfriend or girlfriend-------you could have done worse(people who know movies know the what the bad ones are)---taunt little thriller that tried!----many others don't"
1,Bad Horror = Mimic 2,"This movie takes the cool concepts of Mimic, and then abuses, burns and trashes all the scary moments the first movie brought us.This movie is slightly worse than watching an ant hill in the summer. if that is your idea of fun - then enjoy."
3,Fun movie,"You thought the pseudo cockroaches from the first Mimic were all dead? Well, if there's a sequel, that simply cannot be true, right? The Judas beetles that survived have only further evolved, and one of them wants a mate. Yup.This unsuspecting mate, Remy is a teacher at a school and knows about bugs. The school becomes infested, and she and a couple of kids become trapped in there. At first she thinks the 'mimic' wants to kill her, and eventually finds out his true purpose. Given the ending of the movie, I cannot help but feel disappointed and give this movie only a 3. In seemingly every movie, the monster loses his mate, so I wish this movie had the monster being triumphant and being able to have his mate instead of getting killed. It'd have been interesting to see how things turned out if Remy hadn't killed him. Y'know, just for a change of pace in this genre..."
3,Better than expected,"While it's not big-budget, it's actually a pretty intelligent and enjoyable sequel, and the effects are adequate for the story. The heroine is likeable and smart (and funny), and there are a couple other memorable characters, especially the government chap in charge of extermination.Much more enjoyable than Aliens 3, Aliens 4, and any number of big-budget flops.I'd give it 3.5 stars if I could."
2,Puuuuhleeeeeeeze!,"Starts off good with cool atmosphere and an awesome stunt, then goes south, way south. The worst part is that there is only one bug. This is not obvious other than a demonstration with ants in the beginning, then it makes sense. So this 6 foot cockroach wants to mate with the female lead, and in fact does, thenturns into a perfect replica of a human. Skin tone, eye color, hair pattern, everything.... Check out the behind the scenes to see what I mean."
2,Let's hope they don't go for a Mimic three...,"I had high hopes at the beginning of this movie, it was funny and creative but as it went on it turned into a predictable cliche of a film...I have seen worse movies but this really isn't worth renting."
4,Good but repetitive,"When this album came out, it was a double LP. It probably should have been condensed into one album. This release has some of the best sections of Oldfield music in existence, mostly contained in Parts 1 and 3. Many other parts of the album are, however, very repetitive and grate. The Song of Hiawatha poem in part 2 is quite nice but, once again, goes on too long. This CD is certainly worth picking up, if nothing else for the first and third parts. Even these are repetitive in places, however. This is nothing like the tightly constructed Platinum that followed it."
3,This is semi-deluxe at best,"Compared to the wonderful Deluxe versions of Tubular Bells, Hergest Ridge and Ommadawn, the Deluxe release of Incantations falls considerably short. Completely aside from the part four glitch, which has been promptly addressed by the record company and replacements will be sent when available, my disappointment is focused on the 5.1 dvd release. I was hoping and expecting the entire piece was going to be released in 5.1, and instead, all we are given are snippets. They all sound nice, but they are not the entire work. The new stereo versions sound fine, but they do not interest me as much as a surround version. Why release surround versions of the first three, but not this piece? To be clear, I enjoy everything presented here, but the release is incomplete without a 5.1 version of the entire recording, and as such, hardly qualifies as Deluxe."
1,WARNING -- MASTERING ERROR ON PART 4,"This ""deluxe"" edition has a missing beat at about 12:34 on part 4 which messes up the mood of the piece. I've read they're working on a repaired version; until you KNOW that what you're going to get is that repaired version, you should stay away."
2,Not My Style,"I recently bought this album on EP, in a 2nd hand sale, but I wish I'd never done it. This is not the Mike I like from Crises, Discovery, Heaven's Open, Guitars, Five Miles Out; the albums of his I like best. It may be typically Mike in his late-seventies, but it's definately not his best, in my opinion that is."
3,a disappointing favorite,"I love Incantations, have always loved it and will continue to do so, but if you expect a 5.1 remasted surround work as with the three preliminary releases you will be disappointed. As the Mike Oldfield website states: ""... With the remaster overseen by Oldfield himself, the packages contain a variety of rare material; and again, as with Tubular Bells, Hergest Ridge and Ommadawn, contain a brand new 5.1 mix of Excerpts of Incantations by Oldfield on DVD ..."" The magic word is ""Excerpts"". I am puzzled why they could not be bothered to create a 5.1 mix for the entire Incantations."
3,Better than Hergest Ridge & Omadawn...,"This is a unique album, I purchased the original vinal record when I was in West Germany in the early 80's. The CD is missing a lively instrumental piece at the beginning of track 3. I thought it was one of the better parts of the album. I used to play tracks 1 & 2 to put me to sleep at night. Track 4 is where the best parts are. The drums are great!"
1,Not worth the money for the remastered version,"I have been a fan of Mike Oldfield for a long time, and I have had the CD version of Incantations for years. I bought this remastered version in part because the increase in quality in the remastered version of ""Hergest Ridge"" is remarkable. Well, sad to say, there is much less of an appreciable difference in Incantations. The CD recording was already very clean, and there isn't anymore detail in these new versions. But the worst problem, pure sacrilege, is the missing beat in the vibraphone section at 12:38 in part 4. As of today, 11/23/2011, this error is still in the files offered here on Amazon. It makes me want to get my money back. So, for now - please don't buy this. Don't get me wrong, this is probably my favorite Mike Oldfield piece. But messing up the mastering is inexcusable. Get the old CD - with Oldfield on a beach on the cover - and rip it yourself."
2,WARNING the 5.1 MIXES Surround is not for the entire Record / CD of INCANTATION ???,Shame AMAZON and Mike Oldfield for letting Fans & Customers down on this one...? I bought the Special Super Deluxe because of the Record/CD 5.1 MIX of INCANTATIONs but only about 30 min are in 5.1 Surround ? Half of the CD is missing ???? This is not the entire Record/CD...? Why Advertising this Record/CD as a 5.1 MIX if in real its pretty much botchert....? Shame on both of you MIKE & Amazon for ripping of FANS & Costumers again and not telling as clearly that the whole Record / CD INCANTATIONS is not in 5.1 Surround Sound...? I Wish AMAZON & Mike Oldfield could tell us WHY only half is in Surround MIX...? Please Explain Guys ...? You allready took gladly my MONEY but no Quality in return....? WHYYYYYYY.....? Please Stop your wrong Advertising in luring Peoples to Buy this if its not entirely in 5.1 Mix...?
2,Decidedly NOT DELUXE,"The first three Oldfield re-releases in genuine 5.1 are all a delight, and well worth the cost, but the ""Deluxe"" edition of ""Incantations"" is an ill-considered ripoff, in that the title piece is, in fact, not presented in 5.1 sound at all. It is merely another remaster, to which has been appended a few bonus tracks that were re-done in 5.1. Universal owes everyone who naively purchased this edition not only an apology, but a factual 5.1 DVD remix of the complete piece ""Incantations."" This is simply a shameless, deliberate con on art music fans who should no longer take these artists and companies at their printed word."
2,fire hazard,"This product provided a nice even heat at first, and I found its quiet heat more soothing than a noisy fan-powered unit. One day I carelessly tossed my winter coat on the floor next to the wall-mounted unit, and apparently the sleeve landed against the corner of the unit where a plastic circle covers the wiring.I returned to the room, immediately smelling burning plastic. I pulled away the coat to reveal a burn hole through the plastic circle, completely through to the other side. The unit hasn't come back on since. Be very careful about what you put near this device."
3,Adequate for a small room,"Bought this product from the manufacturer direct since it was unavailable from Amazon.com. Here are my impressions:-easy to install within 20 minutes with a pencil, level, drill, screw driver, superglue (for screw covers)-not rated for bathroom or similar environment which was my plan for a second unit.-works good as a secondary heat source for a cold area in a 12'x15' sized room with insulated walls, one 5x6 feet window and 8' ceiling.-at the recommended 100 sq feet of coverage by Econo Heat as the primary heat source, it is too optimistic.-might work adequately in a 50 sq feet area as a primary heat source as long as the room is well insulated with minimal heat loss from windows/doors etc.-moderately hot to touch without burning.-my dogs learned not get too close to it for warmth.Overall, an adequate addition as a secondary heat source to warm up a cold spot in the room."
3,Works well for correct application... perhaps not in the Northeast,"This heater works well for smaller rooms when the outside temperature is around 25-45 degrees F. You really need multiple heaters running all day long for temperatures around 25 or below in order to have a comfortable room for sleeping. We have changed to Convectaire Apero heaters, (~$225) that put out 1250 watts or the equivalent of ~3 eHeat units. Additionally, the Apero has a thermostat which means that it is not running continually and has be ability to heat a room at 60 degrees to 70 degrees within 30 minutes.We also experienced some cracking in the wall behind our eHeat unit whereas the Apero pushes the heat into the middle of the room."
3,Econo it's not,"I got three of these to replace three 1500 watt heaters. They put out this extremely toxic smell for a few days; it then dissipated. I called the manufacturer about it and a woman answered the phone who's in the wrong business - she doesn't know a thing about customer service. I can't remember talking with a more disagreeable person over the phone.They take 10 hours to warm up, and then put out some nice heat. My electric bill was sky high with these 'econo' heaters - three times what it normally is."
3,CRACKED after only 2 years,"We bought 2 of these; one for the bathroom and one for the basement. The one in the basement cracked across the center and a chasm opened across the top edge abot 1/2 an inch wide. They worked great but the cracks were scary so the one in the basement got tossed while the one in the bathroom will stay there until it starts looking scary, too. I'm debating whether we should get another one. Love the concept, not crazy about the longevity."
2,Wished they worked as advertised,"We installed 4 eco-heaters as supplmentary heaters. They were easy to install 15 minutes. They take up little or no space, make no noise(2 stars).We live in Boston and had all 4 working non-stop since December 1, 2005. The Econo-heater give off about 10% of the heat we expected. The temperature in a test room was only 2 degrees higher. The detail documentation that came with the heater says that you can expect 10% of the heat coming from the face of the heater. That is all the heat you get! The truth of this heater is in the 90 warranty, by the time you figure out it does not work, the warranty has expired. This Econo-heater is a great idea, but get an oil filled heater for heat. The electrity that both burn is the same, but you only get 10% of the heat with the Econo-heater."
2,My Electric Bill Is Higher with Econo-Heat!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Beware!!!!!!!!!!!! If you are buying this product to lower your bill, it won't work! My electric bill has actually been higher from last year since using the econo heat! Last Year I used baseboard electric heat. The econo heat used 200 to 300 more kilowat hours than the baseboard electric heaters!I gave it a two star rating instead of a 'no' star rating because it does heat up the living room nicely, but at what cost?"
2,A good heater for a small room but it cracks,We bought this heater hoping to heat our bedroom and save money on utility costs. It does heat up a small room quite nicely if left on for a while. The only problem I have had is that the unit cracked from normal use and I am not sure if it is safe to use or not. The cracking seems to be a common problem with these heaters if you read other reviews on the web.
4,Good product,"When I bought this product I was skeptic, if this will infact work. I installed 1 panel in a 120 sq ft. room. It works very well. Heats the room to a comfortable temprature in about 30 minutes. After checking this months electricity bill I will buy more of this product."
2,Do not paint it!,"This product worked okay for us. There are few heating options that use so little wattage, which was a necessity for our old home. However, we decided to paint one of these to match the wall. After we painted it, its effectiveness decreased by about 50%. The website even touts this (being able to paint it to match the wall) as an advantage of the product but does not warn that the heater will not work as well afterwards. We contacted the company several times to complain, but they would never get back to us. Like I said, these things are okay, but the company doesn't give you all the facts, and they will not get back to you if you have problems. I won't be buying any more."
3,Exactly what it says it is,"This heater does run at a cheaper rate. I do not feel the heat as I would have hoped, but I am running it in a slightly larger space than recommended. It does keep the space warmer and takes off the edge of cold. Works wonderfully with the recommended thermostat."
4,Heating Panels,I was disappointed that one of the panels doesn't work at all and one was cracked. The others do work fine - did effect my electric bill as expected.
1,I expected a CERAMIC panel. Poor packaging!,This product is no more than a heating element in sheetrock. It is very fragile and packaging is paper thin and any shipper handling the package with care will possible damage it before it arrives.
3,Small Room Ok !,"I bought 2. they worked good. But they only for small room. Don't install closed to the thermostat control because it make the thermostat always high temperture and then the heat systerm will never run. well , this one only work for small room."
2,"The work, but they crack","I have bought over 10 of these heaters for both my house and rental properties. They do heat nicely, the only problem with them is most of them have cracked. Sometimes they crack right away, sometimes they will crack after you turn them off in the spring. I have sent many of them back and they do send you a replacement without a problem. I have even been told to use joint filler to fix the cracks. They are like square pieces of clay, with wires running through them. I think the contraction and expansion of them being turned on to heat and then cooling down when off, cracks them. I've thrown a couple of them out. Wish they would come up with a model that does not crack. Other then that they are great, they do heat."
1,Do Not Buy These Heaters,I bought seven of these heaters two years ago and everyone has developed severe cracks throughout the whole core. I have contacted friends who have also bought this product and they all have the same problem. I contacted the company by phone and was told the warranty had expired and to use silicone caulking to fill in the cracks.These heaters are poorly made. If you research other reviews (not on the company website) you will see similar complaints.
1,Not for me,From the great reviews I really expected this heater to be wonderful but it fell short for me. It might be good for a room the size of a small closet but it did nothing for my bedroom. We couldn't even tell we had added any heat at all. It was really a waste of money for us.
2,Not As Warm As I'd Like.,"I bought the electric panel radiator for the express purpose of saving energy but I just wound up cold.Quite hot in the center but the outer edges were cool to touch. I'm wondering if that's a fault found in my heaters since the product seems to have such rave reviews. It didn't have the heating power I expected. I found the small Soleus radiant heater gave of a lot more heat for 400w, which was the same amount the panel heater used.I live in Atlanta GA, which has quite mild winters so I was disappointed with the performance. But since the panels are permanently attached to my walls I may give them another try this winter."
2,econo-heat no,"I have one of these. Have had it for about 2 years. Recently it has cracked in the center from top to bottom. I have contacted the company and they stated that since it is past the 18 month warranty period, they could not help, however did recommend I replace it and then mentioned of a sale on the item right now. I am going to contact the consumer reports group and email the photo so they may review this item.Overall it ""was"" alright. It takes the chill off of a room. It did not raise temperature significantly. I don't think in my case of 2 year life it was worth the money spent.Also it seemed to produce less heat as time went on."
4,So far they work good,I purchased these for use in my bedroom which was an addition that did not have central air or heat in it. Because of the size of the room I purchased 2 of these. I have only used a couple of days so I'm not sure what effect they will have on my electric bill but hopefully the same or less as the space heaters we were using. I am conserned because the walls in this room are wood shingles? and they seem to heat up. We are looking at other options on mounting. I have purchased the electric temp sensor so that it will turn them off and on as needed. They do get a little hot to the touch but for most adults I don't think it will be an issue.
3,Works okay but not the greatest,"I would rather have spent my money on something else. It's just average at heating a small space. Seems like the wall that I have my unit attached to gets pretty hot, and it makes me a little nervous whether that it is hot enough to be a fire hazard or not because I would really like to leave it on at night, but do not. For this much money I could have purchased something that works better, I believe."
1,Buyer Beware-Warranty not as it seems,"We had this heater for a year. It stopped working. Unlike we were told the heater is not automatically replaced. You need to ship it back at your cost and then they will decide whether or not to replace it! So, you will need to absorb the shipping cost which is likely not trivial and they will let you know whether or not you get a new one. Seems like a bait switch as far as the warranty goes. Also, as other reviewers have noted you should only use this heater for the smallest of rooms. In general, not worth the money."
2,Not what it claimes to be.,The good thing about this heater is that it will heat a 10 by 10 room...eventually. This heater really needs to be on 4-6 hours before you can feel a difference in the room. If left on it will maintain the temperature to about 65 degrees. The web site says the average cost to your electric bill should be about 3 cents an hour and for me it was more about 30 cents an hour. I used the heater maybe 10 times the first month I got it. I left it on for about 10 hours each time and my next electric bill was $35 more than the previous month! Nothing else had change but this heater.
2,Includes the 'official' vocal numbers but is lacking...,"Great. Most of these songs can be found on albums available from each artist. Some of the vocals sung in-film are disregarded for the professional versions that do a good job of white-washing credits with tinny soundtrack. But what I find to be greatly disappointing is the sore lack of Danny Elfman's contribution to the film in this 'original soundtrack.'Try again, studio.Look for 'Music for a Darkened Theatre, Vol. 1' if you want to hear Elfman's number and don't mind receiving a whole package of his other work."
3,The only CD on which,"I could find Put A Little Love In Your heart. As another Amazonner now points out, Put a Little Love is now also available on Al Green compilations. The Al Green/Annie Lennox pairing seemed odd back then, but sounded great and still does."
5,No Elfman,Great CD and soundtrack. lacks the danny elfman score but for people who dont care for scores this is good.
1,Fail!,"Coleman has many good products, but what a shame to even sell this one.Cons:- Too hard and frustrating to use. You need the skill of a surgeon to use this. I have to change the tip position all the time just to start the heating process.- Expensive for something that will likely end up on your next garage sale- Tip is too big for soldering electronics.- Has a warning that the tip breaks easily (because it sure does breaks easily).- Solder fails.Pros:- Cordless (But it doesn't work!!!)- Built-in LED light- Nice case"
3,"A nice debut, but not outstanding","If you're a fan of early Genesis, then by all means, pick this up. It's good prog-rock, well-played and with some really nice parts. But there's no way you can compare this to something like ""Nursery Crime"" or ""Foxtrot"". It's not in that league. But it's also far from a failure."
3,Diet drama,"While it is easy for any early Genesis fan to appreciate so many obvious elements retained here, even Hackett's highly assured debut cannot mask the fact that VOTA suffers from all the typical solo setbacks, from overindulged common characteristics to underdeveloped halfway harmonies, despite the few genuinely justified moves."
2,Excellent example of Prog Rock,One of the best examples of Progressive rock of the 70s and Steve Hackett is a fine guitar player and his music is awsome
4,One of Hackett's best,"This was Steve Hackett's 1st solo effort and was released while he was a member of the supergroup Genesis. He was assisted by the likes of Phil Collins, and Mike Rutherford of Genesis fame as well. Very good progressive rock for the era overall, but the final extended play bonus track, although very good, could have been about 7 or 8 minutes shorter as the same ""chorus"" was simply repeated over and over for at least that long."
5,My FAVE ALBUM BY CAT,"This is a truly overlooked masterpiece. I can listen to it over and over again and never get tired at all. Since the very first song ""Whistlestar"" you are taken to a journey, through sounds and music. ""Novim's Nightmare"" is certainly the finest piece in the album and one of the best songs by Cat Stevens, mysterious and gentle with a great production. ""Jzero"" is such a lovely piece and ""Home"" beautiful. This album has no filler, you can just push play and be sure you will enjoy every single track. My fave album by Cat.... one more thing about the review ""Hokus Pokus"" by tnahpelle from Australia, you may need new ears or brain ;-)"
3,"Fun, but vague","You gotta have a lot of patience with this album if you aren't already enamored of Cat Stevens. It's vague, slightly obtuse in spots and, unlike some of Steven's previous work, it's not really, uh, tuneful. Fortunately, there are also enough places on NUMBERS which come together, but you have to wade through a lot of padding to get to them."
4,"Great, sturdy binder","This is a great sturdy binder with pockets on the inside. We got 2, and just ordered 2 more. recommend."
5,Great lasting binder,I love it. I am a student who puts a lots of HW into this binder and it lasts a long time.
4,Darwin is still a worthwhile read,I had never read this before. Darwin's rationale for devising the theory of natural selection is a masterpiece of logical thought applied to data.
5,"""Oh"", the Madness","Why isn't this album more available on cd than it is? This is criminal!""Q"" is at his very best for this place in time. Never mind that the Brothers Johnson were introduced on this effort. The title song ""Mellow Madness"" is the pace song for this album. I remember listening to this song as it played on the radio. I was only maybe 10-12 years of age, but I still had an appreciation for good music when I heard it. My parents weren't into Quincy Jones as I was. So I could never convince either one of them to take a chance on ""Q"". The slight interest that they did have in him was when ""the theme from Sanford and Son"" played on the radio. My parents love Redd Foxx and this t.v. show. Anyway, there needs to be a huge protest by the fans of the ""Q"" to make ALL of his music readily availiable in the U.S. as well as overseas. It's total madness that we can't get this effort in the U.S. MADNESS !!!"
5,Awesome series,"My 6yo daughter loves this series. She reads one of these to me every day we spend together, and the juxtaposition of the puns allow an excellent learning opportunity as the differences between words that sound alike are so obviously highlighted. An amazingly simple learning tool, good for english learners of all ages."
5,FUNNY AMELIA BEDELIA.,I THINK THAT AMELIA BEDELIA IS FUNNY BECAUSE SHE DOESEVERYTHING WRONG! WHEN MRS. ROGERS ASKS HER TO DO SOMETHING SHE DOESTHE OPPOSITE. AND I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO A FRIEND!
5,The Amelia Bedelia review,"I like every thing about the book. I like Amelia Bedelia becuse she's funny and does everything she's told but the wrong way! Sometime's Amelia Bedelia surprises the Rogers, especially by doing stuff like changing the towels...but with scissors! She also makes good surprises for them. That way she is able to stay! I hope that you will enjoy reading the book! :)"
5,Remembering a book when it was funny and still is today,"Amelia Bedelia was written by Peggy parish. The seriousness of these books are to funny. Amelia Bedelia is my favorite character because she is unique in many ways. She has the quality of bringing happiness to your family. I am sure these books will make you laugh because of how she acts. In the book Amelia Bedelia makes her job more difficult then it seems. But one thing I like about her is she always has a smile on her face. The qualities she has are cooking, and making sure everything gets done. This is why Amelia Bedelia is a great person and story."
1,Literally Stupid,"Most kids love Amelia Bedelia, but I never did. Amelia Bedelia is an inept maid who takes every instruction literally. When her new employers, the Rodgers leave instructions for her to draw the drapes, she draws a picture of the curtains. When told to dress the turkey, she puts clothing on it. When told to change the towels, she cuts them to shreds. She should have been made to pay for the damage. Then there was that stupid stunt with the dusting powder.Mrs. Rodgers was just as annoying. As she was chewing Amelia out for her ineptitude, Mr. Rodgers shoves a piece of pie in her mouth to shut her up. Naturally, the way to her heart is via her stomach, so once placated with food, the virago relents and keeps Amelia on. You can be sure Amelia baked plenty of those pies to keep her satisfied."
3,It's Okay,I really was expecting a little bit more from this product since I read a lot of outstanding reviews. But I have to say that I am neither overwhelmed or particularly enthusiastic about this night creme. It is not greasy and does not have any kind of annoying smell. I am pretty savvy on moisturizers and this one is exactly as I would expect for the price. Average and useful when you have nothing left in the bathroom cabinet.
1,never seen!!!!,"My order never arrived!!!they wrote from Milano and send me a lot of paper for customs, and so my order is in Milano! I send the paper with all the information but my order never arrived!!!please write me what i could do!thank you a lot"
4,It's very relaxing,"I put in the music when i need to relax, even if i'm working on the computer. It is soothing and helps me calm down..i recommend this cd."
4,Good Reading! Felt Like I was With Frazier & Debusschere on a fast break!,Dollar Bill never really lived up to the hype of his pro career.But he did have success on the court. His life at Princeton was interesting.This is a fine book that keeps your interest. No doubt old Knick fans like myselfenjoy this more than other basketball fans. Thinking about how much Bradley has accomplishedin his life is quite a feat!
5,A beautiful mind!,"""A sense of where you"" are, offers a fascinating look at a true scholar athlete. Author John McPhee`s debut is well written and gives the reader a look at how a student athlete should approach life and grasp the opportunity ahead. Bill Bradley is the consumate teamplayer who pays tribute to the small and important details of the game of basketball. A hoop junkie growing up, but also a reflective mind,perhaps too reflective to become President of the United States.An inspiring book that should be read by people of any age, who seek to become successfull at whetever they do."
5,One of my favorite albums period.,"Discovery is one of my favorite albums, an Oldfield masterpiece. This album has some of my favorite Oldfield songs, and an excellent instrumental piece ""The Lake"" (12 minutes long).This album was the album that got me interested in Mike Oldfields music, and he is my favorite composer now. ""To France"", ""Tricks of the Light"", ""Crystal Gazing"" and ""Poison Arrows"" are my favorites. Maggie Reilly has one of the most beautiful voices I have ever heard. Weather or not you are an Oldfield fan I suggest that you buy this album."
5,"Dream-inspiring, thoughtful, lyrical music for the soul","When I first heard this album playing on the radio at the tender age of ten, it captured my imagination and my heart. From this early beginning has grown a longstanding appreciation of Mr. Oldfield's music. ""Discovery"" successfully blends what I now know is his trademark sound: elements of folk, modern electronic sounds and plaintive guitar riffs, married together with moving rhythms and on the vocal tracks touchingly simple lyrics. ""To France"" is perhaps the strongest vocal track and provides a nice counterpoint to the lyrical instrumental ""The Lake"" whose strains still echo in my mind creating fanciful images and fantastic landscapes."
4,Depends on what you like,"I can see the points of those that don't like it and of course I see the side that likes it. This is a sometimes brilliant, sometimes spacey, sometimes jazzy, and sometimes silly album. But, it is always great music to these ears. Listening right now to the female space vocals similar to a Gong album, then right into an intense march beat with Hammond organ. Awesome. I give it 4 stars as it can get a little dragged down but not for long. The Rotters Club is a 5 star effort, they perfected it for the second album.Phil Miller the guitar player is different than most I have heard and he is masterful. Richard Sinclair on bass, has jazz licks and a top notch voice, some great exchanges with Miller. Pip Pyle is one of the top 5 drummers in prog rock, damn he is good. Dave Stewart on keyboards and I suspect the musical direction is a master of his craft as well. If you like 70's mellow prog, you will dig this."
5,Truly one of a kind.,"I purchased this album when it first came out in the 70s, partly, it must be admitted, out of amusement at the name (coming from Hatfield, as I do). I have never tired of it in all this time, and even today, I can sit down and give it my undivided attention, and quite possibly pick up on something in it I never noticed before! Staggering musicianship (drummer Pip Pyle in particular), highly original composition, where the transitions between improvised and composed passages are almost seamless. When you consider how pompous and devoid of ideas a lot of the bigger prog. rock bands had become by the mid 70s, I suppose the punk ""revolution"" was by and large a good and necessary thing, but the simultaneous discrediting (by association) of the more ""left of centre"" artists such as the Hatfields, Henry Cow, Robert Wyatt etc. was an instance of throwing out the baby with the bath water, and really shouldn't have happened. This music deserves a revival."
5,A must-have for Canterbury fans.,"Richard Sinclair was my favorite member of Caravan, and the band was never the same after he left to form Hatfield.The whole family tree which grew from the Canterbury groups (Soft Machine and Caravan) made their best records at a time when jazz was going nowhere and jazz-rock had collapsed into fusion-funk.I recommend that the neophyte start with Caravan's ""If I Could Do It All Over Again"" and Soft Machine's ""Volume Two"". If you like those, then bump it up a notch for Hatfield and the band it became, National Health."
2,Don't get burned by this one like I did.,"I just don't get this album. It's annoying, disjointed, and hard to listen to. Maybe it's like Piers Anthony's Macroscope - it will only work if you have a certain intelligence level. I guess I'm not at that level? I see people really love this one, but I can't stand it. If you are into Caravan or Camel, this album is nothing like those bands. I only gave it two stars because its better than all the one-star radio garbage. At least it's interesting and different - just like Frank Zappa's Jazz from Hell - and equally as difficult to listen to as the FZ album. I ebayed mine after giving it a serious chance.Just goes to show you how different people's music tastes are. I love all those progressive bands from the 70's, but this one is a real dog, in my opinion.And this is the one people wanted if they could have one album on a desert island? Geez...."
3,Not Sinclair's best work,I bought this based on my appreciation of Sinclair's work with Caravan and Camel but also due to someone describing the album as the one he'd take to a desert island. Not me. The songs here are sloppy compared to Sinclair's work with the other bands. No doubt in those situations the other musicians held him to higher standards than when he was calling the shots himself.
5,Hard to find!,"We love vacationing in Liguria and love their olive oil. We can't find this in local stores, so ordering online is great!"
5,"Fast moving, very good acting","I really enjoyed this video collection of Muñecas de la mafia Part 1, (El comienzo) and I have already ordered Part 2, ( El final). This soap opera is fast moving, the acting is very good and the filming very professional. It helps to have a command of the Spanish language and maybe some ""Paisa "" friends to help with some of the regionalisms due to the lack of subtitles (in the edition I purchased). Unlike movies with poorly translated English subtitles that cannot be disabled, here there is no loss of linguistic realism of the Antioqueño drug culture being portrayed."
1,Did not have subtitles,I purchased this to try to learn spanish. I says it has subtitles and so did a review I read about it. But unfortunately there was no subtitles. I gave it 1 star because it was misleading.
5,i love it,"La vdd me super encanta esta serie. La vdd se la recomiendo a todo mundo, esta muy interesante, se trata de mafiosos y mujeres ke andan con ellos y muchos dramas ahi."
1,Didn't do a thing for me,"Not much more I can say... certainly not worth the money. I'm all about Nature's Way, but it didn't do a thing for me."
2,Trying to raise my resistance level.,Been taking this product for a month now and I'm still fighting glandular infection. My brother and his wife take it and love it. Will try it a little longer.
5,Great Product,This stuff helps me get through cold and flu season without giving up the things I like to do--or having to suffer from cold symptoms while at work. I just pop 3 when I'm feeling under the weather and that's it. The stuff is awesome...period.
4,Very Thought Provoking,"This is a very good read - I think he has missed the point with his conclusions, but what he says is thought provoking none the less. Readers should follow the article up with a read of the book ""IT Doesn't Matter - Business Processes Do""."
4,Useful Tool for the Amateur Genealogist,This is a great primer for researchers. Basic research techniques are explained and detailed. Lots of tips and tricks. Some of the techniques are a little too detailed like how to compose a letter and create a manual filing system but all in all a very worthwhile book. Also some of the information is a bit dated but most of it is timeless. I'm certain that I'll be referring to it for many years to come.
2,A jumpy plot,"This novel did not hold my interest. I found myself skimming forward. The plot skips forward in time from chapter to chapter, and skips between people in various sub-plots. It does seem to have a main character, more or less, but often is dealing with someone else. It seems to be left unfinished to lead into a sequel. The writing seems to be soap opera style.The story is about competition to control the mineral wealth in the asteroids, a lawless frontier where competition can get deadly. Everyone has their own agenda. Like in real life, most prospectors die broke. The money is made by companies selling them supplies.It is hard to find white hats in the story, as everyone involved seems willing to kill to achieve their goals."
1,"Sorry, It doesn't measure up","I've been a fan of Ben Bova for years, but Rock Rats doesn't measure up to his other novels. Rats was very disappointing, indeed. None of the characters are well-devoloped. Most of the asteroid miners are so dumb that they shouldn't be allowed to pilot spacecraft. And the chief badguy, the would-be monopolist Martin Humphries, wouldn't have lasted a day at Enron or Worldcom. The characters just blunder along from one silly encounter to the next. And the dialog is only one step above ""Plan Nine From Outer Space"".Seriously, did Ben Bova really write this novel? Or is he ill and the publishers hired a ghost writer?"
2,Let Down,I am a Ban Nova fan from way back but I was disappoint with this book. The characters are shallow (and I agree with another reviewer: the miners are so dumb they'd be flat out in charge of a bicycle let alone a space ship) and the plot is under developed.What irked me the most was the poor formatting in the Kindle eBook version I bought. Continual hyphenation of words and names was annoying. The publisher or post scan proof reader obviously fell asleep on the job.
2,Bad editing and redundant narrative trumps space pirates,"Book one was great, but Rock Rats is missing something. In addition to a few grammatical errors the book is over simplified. I found that I despised the way Bova reintroduced the characters and plot lines from the first book. There was a tendency to use narrative instead of letting character dialogue and scene description tell the story. But hey, its got space pirates, that's good."
3,"""Dallas"" in space","Martin Humphries continues in the role of the ""man you love to hate"", acting as a late-21st Century ""J. R. Ewing"", in this 2nd installment from the ""Asteroid Wars"" trilogy.This book is a definite improvement over the first from the series (""The Precipice""), in almost all areas. While the science is still a bit sketchy, and there are actually less climactic moments in this book than the first one; this book is more consistant, and the story holds together better than the first book; which had the idiotic ""invisible suit"" gimmick that was thankfully left out this time around.If the author could somehow steer away from the original silly premise of mankind-caused global catastrophic environmental upheavals, these books would rate much better. The ""Greenhouse Cliff"" premise is silly enough (and thankfully was not brought up much in this book, as in the last), but the implied idea that mankind's ""follies"" could somehow cause ongoing and massive earthquakes is simply ridiculous."
3,It's alright,"I love period pieces because the acting is usually superb. However, I felt as if the young actress playing Nannerl was a robot! She hardly showed any emotion - when she wiped away tears as she was burning her music, I didn't even know she was crying. There seemed to be no emotional inflection in her speech. This, however, could be because I don't speak French and might be part of the language barrier. Despite this, I think this film was good. I really liked the idea of it - the oppression of a young girl's talent. Some parts were a bit choppy. For example, when Nannerl stayed in Paris on her own, it took me a while to get that she was by herself and I was a bit confused at first. Overall, I'm not upset that I watched this film, but I'm not going to remember it in two days."
3,For the music,"I enjoyed the movie for the music and I wanted to learn more about the history surrounding Mozart. The acting and storyline were far from being oscar material. Vaguely reminded me of Amadeus, maybe I was expecting the same brought by Salieri narrating."
3,Mozart's Sister,"A little slow at first. The story was interesting, the acting was ok and the film was polished with life style of the era."
2,Stagnant,"Stagnant is the best way to describe this movie. Stagnant script and acting. I felt that this film had no point. We get it, Nanerl is overlooked by everyone in favor of her younger brother...annnnd? What else? Perhaps if maybe one of these characters were likable to the point of being able to connect with them, I would have enjoyed this movie at least a little bit. The dialogue was not only boring, but delivered in such a monotone, emotionless way that it seemed as if everyone in this movie were on horse tranquilizers while filing.I had very high hopes for this, I love period film, but come on. At least TRY."
5,Such an amazing film!,"I absolutely love classical music and Mozart ranks among the top on my favorite list. To have a movie made in regards to the story people do not generally know or care about, that of Mozart's sister, is such a thrill. I was enthralled by the beauty of this movie and I hope that subtitles do not throw anyone off the fact that this movie, in regards to the screenwriting and filming, is very beautiful. As a disclaimer, I do speak French marginally well and thus the subtitles did not bother me. Give this movie a chance and see for yourself whether I speak truthfully or not. :)"
5,Another perspective...,"This movie was recommended to us by a friend. It tells a story of Mozart's sister. Who knew he had a sister! It was well told, presented well for the period giving a perspective of what was/wasn't expected from women... not to mention, the music was wonderful!!! Both my husband and I enjoyed it... and have passed the DVD on to friends to circulate."
3,good,"HA! One guy loves this album and the other guy hates it. I was giving this three stars before I even look at the two other reviews, but now this even makes more sense.This is not bad by any standard. Raw Material uses some progressive elements here--flute, sax, jazzy vibraphone--and works nice solos. Some of this music is based on hard rock/blues structures, not quite prog, but the soloing and the ambition make this proto-prog if not the genuine article.The problem I find is that there are a lot of different song ideas here; they are all good but very disperate, and the album does not seem to head in any one direction. There is no center of gravity.Still, worth a listen"
1,The first effort is bad!,I have both albums of Raw Material. The second album has strong progressive structure with strange and beatiful melodies. But the first is the bad parody on progressive music. Very bad ...
2,A Rehash of Lousy Copies,"I agree with the music fan from Dearborn, Mi. It is a re-hash of a lot of crummy remakes and poorly recorded originals. I recorded Rawhide and Gilligan's Island off my TV set with better sound, as well as the original and superior versions of the Twilight Zone and Wild Wild West (with a cool guitar riff, not this Mantovani styled remake). If you really don't care about these type of things, then this is the disc for you. Avoid this if you are a true television theme aficionado."
2,Passable.,"there are only a few tunes here that sound like the originals i grew up with.the complete Gilligan's island theme is the real deal,and that recording sounds good.the best""oldie""television theme songs can be found in the television's greatest hit's series which is out of print and(whew)expensive."
4,Great Insight Into The Federal Government As The Pusher-Man,"The federal government has grown from its humble origins to the behemoth it is today. The question why this has become a basic fact of modern life. Part of it rests in the efforts of federal politcians to secure their electoral futures through the provision of aid to the states, part of it also rests in the federal government's wish to ensure standards across local communities, but another part rests in the efforts of the state and local governments to lobby for federal aid. These governments go to the federal government because they want to secure more benefits for their residents but without increasing the taxes they collect from these individuals. They do this because it helps local politicians. This book tells how they ""apply"" pressure to the federal government. Camissa does a great job of illustrating these governments secure benefits, as well illustrating how the system works for those involved."
3,Much repeat from Volume I,"Simpler procedures than the ones described in Volume I. I guess that it might be useful for the ones who wants to learn to become an aesthetis surgeon, although the infomation provided is still quite limited.The author could have spent more time and pages describing the complications and pitfalls of the procedures described instead of promoting himself again and again.The author promotes his own products at the last portion of the book.There are many repeat contents and pictures in the adjuvant chapter from the 1st volumn.The DVD is a Zone II format. It cannot be played in the US unless you have a European DVD machine.Overall, the artist of the book is the best in the business. The content of the book is too pale in comparison."
2,Type S 10402 Compass-Blue,"This compass does not word well. Often fails to give correct direction, by over 90 degrees. It's no good."
1,Doesn't work well in cars,"Bought 2, 1 for each of my two cars, because they were cheap. They don't work no matter where in/on the car I place them, likely the magnetic fields of the cars making them totally inaccurate.You get what you pay for in this case."
4,Meaningful Words!!,"Listening to the words in this CD and the meaning behind them brings home the reality, that love can be accomplished at almost any time. This is an outstanding piece of music and I highly recommend this CD to anyone."
3,Satisfactory Shoe!,"This shoe looks totally awesome from the side where the picture is taken. However, the other side is a tan color and it like a hightop shoe. The shoe is different on both sides! I recomend saving your money!"
2,Adequate at best,"The larger sizes are probably fine for most applications, but I have gone through two of the 1/16"" punches. They bend easily and are prone to breaking under stress that a punch should easily be able to withstand. If you are planning to use the smallest punch, look for a higher quality set, or purchase this set and plan to upgrade the smallest punch when it breaks."
2,Poor quality,I used the smallest punch in the set trying to remove a pin from an old pistol I have. I was hitting it with a 4 ounce hammer and the punch mushroomed on the small end and bent. Crummy Chinese punch. I'll look elsewhere for another punch set.
5,Stanley 16-226 6 Piece Punch Kit,I was surprised at the weight of these! These feel very heavy and sturdy and so far have performed well. I dont see how you could go wrong with this set!
3,just a punch kit,it looks like a nice tool what I want but it's not durable enough...handy kit with average quality with nice price by the way.
5,Stanley 16-226 6 piece punch kit,The punch kit is well made and comes at a good price. I ordered this kit to do a trigger replacement on my hunting rifle and it definitely made short work of the project.
1,Waste of Money for Gunsmith Work,They might work Ok for some mechanical projects but they are NOT case hardened which is needed on many mechanical projects one may work on or other task such as gunsmithing! First one I used bent like so bad it was unusable.
4,great,"punches are great, come in a plastic case, easy to keep track of, if struck with a metal hammer the yellow paint does chip off"
3,great set,great set just wished the smallest 1 wasn't so weak...used it once and it bent under a light tap with a rubber hammer but other then that one the rest have taken a beating in the last 2 weeks and have help up flawlessly so my advice here is if your buying it for the smallest punch you should probably look elsewhere but if you just need a cheap set to hold you over for odd jobs then this should serve you fine for years.
5,Great movie!,"This was a great movie. It had a specific message, and it really made me think and consider some of the things that go on in our world. I would definitely recommend it."
3,Cool the first time around...,"Still kinda cool the second time around too. Plot line is contorted enough, like the animation, to keep you interested. Honestly though the fact that it's animated in this style seems somewhat unnecessary for the most part, but certainly is an eye candy element to make this a repeat watching. The cast comes through the animation and characters well. The blu-ray element is crisp and clean though nothing so profound in detail to make it a reference."
2,Good....But not great...worth a rent,"This movie is NOT for you if you cannot handle movies just being flat out weird. Sure, there are plenty of plot holes, Reeves is in it so don't expect an academy award.....however the plot is very interesting (again filled with tons of holes) but I watch a movie to be entertained, not to be a film critic or to analyze everything.Overall, if you like weird movies like ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" this movie is for you, if not and you like to be a nerd about movies and analyze every little detail about how ""true to life"" it may or may not be.....well just skip this one."
2,not very good,I had high expectations but had to turn it off halfway through. Story was going nowhere....
2,Not a good film,"What else is there to say?The acting is mediocre, the story line is nearly non-existent, and the only redeeming thing this film has to offer is the somewhat interesting cartoons superimposed upon the original score.The vast disconnect between the book and the movie is at its most evident when the film ends, concluding with a quote from Phillip K. Dick that has virtually nothing to do with what you've just seen and makes you wish that it (the film) did."
3,Decent movie,"Nothing too amazing, but the animation was good for its time. Decent actors and an interesting ending. Only watched it once and that was good enough for me."
5,Seen through a scanner...darkly,"This film is not just good, it's great. An instant classic. Animation, using the rotoscoping technique, gets no better; more time was spent on the animation than on the filming. Perfect casting. Oscar worthy everywhere. Great script, great directing. A thinking man's film. With scramble suits and scrambled minds. A movie with a lesson in wisdom. Toughtful and humorous. Worth owning, studying, and watching again and again. Another great film inspired by Phillip K. Dick; another man who died too soon."
2,long,"this movie is long and long you have to wait for the ending.thats why they didn't show it in theaters,but the pics are good"
3,Maybe you should get stoned before watching this.,"In the beginning of the movie, I listened to everything that was going on, yet I still didn't understand what was going on. Once I understood what was going on, the story went flat.I have to admit that I was bored for the first hour or so, despite the brilliant animation. There was a bunch of talking, but nothing was really happening. By the time the story started to become interesting (when we find out the real identity of Donna), it was over.The climax would have been better if more interesting things had led up to it. I can even see the climax as being the opener for a much bigger story.I haven't read the story, so I can't compare it to the movie. It's just a shame that such great animation was wasted on a mediocre story. The actors were good, but they didn't have much to work with.Still, it wasn't a total flop. I liked it to a certain extent. If you don't see it in the theatre, I suggest renting it before buying it."
1,could not get film to play!,"I coulc not get this film to play - so therefore I cannot review the item - if you re-send me the film and I am able to get it to play, then I will be able to review it."
1,Wish I had walked out,"I saw this movie in the theater and recall the entire time thinking ""gee I should really just leave"" but my friend seemed into it. It turns out we were both thinking the same thing."
1,Disk Would not play,"this movie is good but this HD -DVD version has a lot of problems playing, I have a samsung playr with updted software and it still skips in chapters 6-10. I will have to get a regualr version"
2,Boring Boring Boring,What else can I say...I thought this movie would have a point. Couldn't wait for it to end. Would not even rent this flick.
3,Funny and dark,"the graphics are great, the subject matter is dark. It's not my type of movie but I watched it because the characters were so realistic"
4,Intriguing,"A deeply intriguing film. I can't say I'm not sure I understood it; unequivocaly, I did not. I wish I had purchased it instead of renting it though because I'd like to try again - and maybe a third time is on the horizon. I think it's full of metaphors that don't quite match what's going on in the primary plot. I recommend it."
1,The horror...the horror....the horror.,"I'm a fan of Philip K. Dick, the same way I'm a fan of slowing down to look at a car accident. While I'd never want to be in one, I am curious to see the carnage. Toward the end of his life, Dick battled drugs and even claimed he was psychic. Yeah... so naturally Hollywood loves adapting his crazy books into movies...The big plot device was the scramble suits that kept changing images - something the book artfully executed, but in the movie it was silly. Maybe it was the animation style that made the suit look goofy. Or maybe it was the 2-D nature of movie watching. Or the fact that it was a freaking cartoon... Whatever it was, it ruined the movie for me.Instead of wasting more of my limited brain power describing why this movie sucked, I'll end with a this:Roses are RedViolets are BlueThis movie would've made senseIf you had been sniff'n glue."
1,Are you kidding me?,This was an awful movie. There was no story line. Nothing to follow. What a great idea to be wasted.
1,SO FRIGGIN' BAD.,"This movie was terrible and I really couldn't wait for it to end. I'm glad I did watch until the end though, for the final scenes of the movie were the most powerful and tragic. The rest of the film was just a terrible buildup with dialogue that could easily inspire auditory bleeding to a less desensitized person than myself. Terrible. Almost as bad as Edmund."
1,i was not getting it,this is the first time i have seen anamated movie with keanu reevesand i was just not getting it it dedent work for me at all there had tobe somthing more to the movie but there wasent
3,Tepid,"With a story based on an acclaimed science fiction novel, director Richard Linklater using the same cool rotoscoping technique he used in the sublime ""Waking Life"" and a cast of iconoclast actors, ""A Scanner Darkly"" seemed to have all the elements in place to make a great film. And although this isn't a bad film, it just doesn't ever quite click and become engrossing. Maybe it's because there have been so many far superior films that explored either the desperate paranoia of drug addiction (""Requiem for a Dream"", ""Trainspotting"") or a ""Big Brother is watching"" dystopian future (""The Matrix"", ""V for Vendetta""). In any case, this film is probably worth watching for anyone who appreciates either the science fiction or drug film drama. But I doubt it will make many fans' top ten lists."
2,"despite an interesting premise, great author and good actors...it's BORING!","An animated cerebral movie cannot work. Cerebral with interesting direction can be good. But in this movie, there's nothing visual going on and you, basically, just have a drama with animation applied over the film.It doesn't work.This movie stinks because it's so boring."
2,New Age Art ??,"OMG! The plot line might of been good I do not know as I could not stand to watch this form of animation.The way the artists drew the faces of these characters was terrible.The shadows of the faces were like they were moving all the time,it was madness to watch.It was like the shadows had a life of their own and it was very irritating to watch,so I quit after about ten minutes.I could not stand to watch it.It drove me nuts."
2,Not sure what the hype is about.,"I'm sorry...I really, really tried to get into this movie and just couldn't. It was just plain boring. Normally I love these types of movies but not this one. I just kept waiting and waiting for the 'point' or for something to make the last hour and a half of watching it worthwhile. Never happened. I would recommend renting this one first just to make sure."
2,Hmmm,"well I liked the movie because it was different , and that it was .I dont know why all the rave reviews , the movie itself wasnt that good .No where near clssic as someone else mentioned , Different yes / classic no... there really isnt whole lot to the movie itself , A cop gets hooked on a drug and so on and sent to la la land to make more drugs .dont trust all the rave reviews , I did that when I first started downloading movies from Amazon and boy did I get bent over a few times from trusting the rave reviews ."
3,"Great Quality, Par Movie","In terms of quality, the play back of this blu-ray is top notch. Colors were clear and vibrant, this is the main reason for the movie as most people know. The vector animation scheme done throughout the movie is easily scaled to full 1080p and on my 52"" Bravia it looked great. As for the movie, it's not too bad, but its nothing to brag about. I would classify it as one of those movies that you just have to own because of the technique used. I gave this item 3 stars."
1,Keanu heaves,"What is the fascination with Keanu Reeves anyway? He can't act his way out of a wet paper bag, and he proves it again here. I'm so bored with his tired, brooding one-dimensional character that he portrays in every movie.I know! Let's give him an f-bomb in every line and rotoscope over the film. Shucks, that didn't work either.The fetching Mrs. Brew and I made it through about half of this sensibility bludgeoning before we gave up and smashed it to bits. I'm sure that the second half was just as stupid as the first. Besides, we couldn't find the tin-foil to make our hats.I know that some of you will say that I have no right to make this judgment without seeing the whole thing. So I'll ask you, if I set a bowl of poop in front of you with milk and a spoon, would you tell me that it's no good to eat before you get through the whole thing? And why would that be?"
1,Regarding the HD DVD,"Have not yet seen the movie!This was one of the films I ordered for my very first HD order. Also included in the order were King Kong, Mission Impossible 1~3, The Good Shephard & Children of Men.Of these, only KK and MI 1~3 played on my new Xbox360 HD DVD player.The other three discs could not play!I started looking into this on the net and found that this was some sort of interface problems with the Xbox 360, although I only found this problem relating to The Good Shephard and Children of Men specifically and no instances of this problem occuring with A Scanner Darkly during my search on the net, it could be that I was just unlucky and got a defective copy of this HD DVD. I have read that there will be update release from MS to correct this problem through Xbox Live, but I'm not sure this will fix the problem. If you've got the Xbox 360 HD DVD player, be warned this may not work on your player. Anyone else having this problem, I would certainly like to know!"
1,Uninspiring Yawn-Fest,"This film really is pants. A rambling, fairly pointless story presented in an unnecessary format. I'm afraid it is pretentious rather than cutting edge and is barely entertaining."
1,WHAT !?!?,"This movie was aweful, the only reason i gave it 1 star was because the animation rocked, i wish they would make more movies with that animation but for god sakes could you please include a storyline with it ?"
3,Weirdest Movie,"In Sum: WeirdShould you Buy? Sure.This is one of the weirdest movies I have ever seen. The movie is presented in vector animation, which is very cool. Luckily the use of graphics did not detract from the film but added to its weirdness, if you can even figure out what its about and why it occurs in Anaheim. The script is great, with Neo, Woody Harrelson and that one chick from some slacker movies.How does this play in HD DVD? Very well, but nothing special. Animation is a weird thing in HD, especially CGI. I never saw this in SD, but I think it would look okay - obviously not HD quality, but good. Nothing really special or ""wowie"" about the video quality though.The audio is also middle of the road. There is a nice crisp environment, but like the video ... nothing ""wowie"" about it.Ultimately, this is a fun and weird movie to watch and great on a big TV. The extra features are informative, but forgettable.ILHDDVD Rating: 3/5 (Lack of wowie)"
3,Random events,"This thin volume, illustrated with gothic cartoons, tells a story in an oblique manner. Edward Gorey's work is well-known but appeals mostluy to a small clique."
1,LESSON LEARNED,ELITE COFFEE POT BAD PRODUCT. ONLY WORKED 1 TIME. I HAD THROWN AWAY ALL PACKAGING SO COULD NOT RETURN PLUS I AM HOUSE BOUND. LEARNED A LESSON
1,Good for travel but short lifetime,"I found I could make good coffee using 2 level scoops of coffee and plugging it in for exactly 10 minutes, but it died on me after less than 15 uses. A real throwaway appliance."
1,not worth the price,"i,m on a fixed income and wanted a small, inexpensive coffee maker so i purchased this product.it leaves a large amount of grounds in the bottom (sludge) and no matter how many times i ran clear water through the perk cycle the coffee tastes like plastic."
1,Save Your Time - Money You'll Get Back,"Purchased two pots, the first broke after one use. The second stop working after the third pot of coffee. Quality control lacking."
2,Elite Cuisine EC900 4 Cup Automatic Tea and Coffee,Not Really a 4 cup percolator....only holds 2 cups of liquid water. No auto shut off....you must unplug unit.
1,Piece of junk,"I obtained this item for an elderly friend who wanted the old-fashioned type of percolator. When I spoke with her after her receiving and using it she said it was a piece of junk and was not happy with it.Maxi-Matic EHC-900 Elite Cuisine 4-Cup Percolator, White"
3,4 cup percolator,"I had a coffee pot that looked exactly like this one. I was surprised it was so small and it does not make 4 cups of coffee, based pn 8 oz = a cup. I was very disapointed in this."
2,Maxi Matic 4 cup percolator,"Was very disappointed; did not have in the description of the product, that the electric cord could not be removed from the pot to make easier travelling. Would not have purchased had I known that"
5,Izitso,Yusuf or Cat Stevens he is the greatest ever. I've been listening to him for 35 years and am very excited he's back.
3,Disappointed,"I expected a lot from this movie. I knew it was made-for-TV and had low production values but that didn't bother me. I thought it was too fast-paced and it had some terrible casting. Why were Heathcliff and Cathy, who looked to be at least in their thirties, runnning around the moors like little kids? They're not supposed to be grown up when they do that! They meet the Lintons when they're 12 years old! I've yet to see a version which actually portrays them as kids for that scene, but this one was the worst because they look so darn old! Cathy is supposed to be, what, 20 or so when she dies? Orla Brady was 37! Heathcliff was even older, which was fine for the later scenes but couldn't they have even tried to age him down with makeup?? Also, Nelly was supposed to be Hindley's age, yet she was in her fifties for the whole movie!!! I'm not a purist by any means but things like this make it hard to take a film seriously. It was alright, but again, way too fast-moving. An average movie."
2,withering heights.,"apparently, this version is 'stunningly good'.. according to many. which surprises me.this is the first film adaptation i have watched. yes, it is VERY close to the text. but it just wasn't enjoyable. i found all of the actors to be thoroughly NOT likeable. they were too exaggerated, too comical.i was looking for that warmth. i realize that this is a dark tale. but even so. stories like jane eyre, anything by austen, or thomas hardy: they have a certain amount of class, sophistication. the kind of stories you can curl up to.not this version."
2,Characters way too old for their parts,"The movie is ok. The movie's characters are way too old and not properly cast in the movie. Heathcliff and Cathy are young -- not near 40 ! Nelly is of their age - not an apparant 40-year old as shown in the movie! Joseph is written to be crass and you can imagine him an old, somewhat haggard man of poor speech - not a handsome, erect, well spoken servant. It was not well done at all. For passion and more believable characters, watch Timothy Dalton as Heathcliff and Anna Calder as Catherine. This movie detailed their lives from start to finish - not of the children's as continues in the book, but the passion was definitely there for the main characters."
1,Thought it would never end!,"Of all the dreadful messes! This movie ought to be cut up to make mandolin picks! Perfectly awful in every way! The woman who plays Cathy is the worst ""actress"" I have ever seen -- such grimacing! AVOID this at all costs! To be fair, I have never seen a good filmed version of Wuthering Heights. It is my opinion that the novel is unfilmable. And maybe that's as it should be: some stories simply can't be translated to the screen. Wuthering Heights is one of them."
3,Wuthering Heights,"It has been years since I seen a different version of Wuthering Heights,very good version but I forgot how disterbing this story is. Acting very good but I also bought this version because it was on Matthew Macfadyne credits he was only in about 10 minutes on film."
2,Weird!,This movie does not follow the book very well and the acting is disgraceful. The only good point is Matthew Macfayden is in it.
2,They can't all be golden...,There are many versions of this story that are dull and tedious. This is one of those. It was a chore to watch.
4,A Pleasure to Watch,"The film, Wuthering Heights, is a sturring adaptation of the book. Raplh Fiennes gives yet another powerful performance as the lovelorn Heathcliff. He captures the wild sprit of the character and the heartache brilliantly. Juliette Binoche is beautiful as Catherine and her daughter, playing duel roles. The film truly is a gem that not many are aware of. Teaming a very compatible couple of Fiennes and Binoche. Enjoy !"
4,Nice but not long enough,"Good for the price but the hose themselves need to be longer, (I am 5'4) but the lace trim from the hose to the band around the waist is very long"
4,A funny movie with many hard to catch jokes! A WINNER!,"This movie was very entertaining. The very first time I saw it, I wasn't paying attention and missed most of the jokes. But then at a party, I watched it and paid very close attention to it (I had nothing better to do) and found it awesome! Bruce Willis is one of my favorite actors and he has not let me down. Him and Matthew Perry were a great team. The attractive Amanda Peet added well to the movie. And another one of my favorite actors, Michael Clarke Duncan, did a extrodiany job as a conman. He is usually in serious roles but this proved he is a great all around actor. HE IS AWESOME!! So I suggest you see the movie more than once because the funnier jokes are the ones you'll miss."
2,"Not a ""Black"" Comedy!","When I rented this movie, I was under the impression that I was going to watch a ""dark"" or ""black"" comedy because it was listed as such in Amazon.com. In fact, this poorly filmed and dim-witted comedy has nothing to do with the genre that includes films such as ""Dr Strangelove"", ""Man bites dog"", ""Pulp fiction"" or ""Fargo"".The plot is deceptively predictable, and the acting is very poor. Arquette does a very bad job imitating the French-Canadian accent and the other actors are not very convincing either as criminals.Although it is not the worst comedy I have ever seen, I still recommend not wasting any time watching it."
2,"bad, probably because I've only paid a cent",I have paid just a cent and because of that it gets messsed up at the end. I know better....now.
4,Cleverly entertaining,"While this may not be my absolutely favorite film with Bruce Willis ,it is still great. First off, all of the acting is significanly brilliant. But consider that a bonus, the story here is what really counts. I picked up this movie expecting it to be a half-decent, but still entertaining flick (considering I picked it up cheap). To tell the truth, I probably wouldn't have bought it if it wasn't rated R. However, it is an extremely mild movie. Consider it a PG-13 movie with an extensive nude scene. Either way, I was enthralled with how great the plot was. There were so many unexpected twists and genuinely hilarious dialogue, it made the movie extremely loveable. Take my word for it and get this movie, you won't be dissapointed."
3,ONLY AMUSING,"If you have absolutely nothing else to do, then you MAY want to watch this movie. I think there were maybe 4 or 5 good laughs in the whole thing."
4,A Deliciously Dark Comedy,"Ok Imagine this for a premise. A former Hit Man moves in as a next door neighbor. You know who he is but thinks that he doesn't know you know. In the meantime Your wife is trying to have you killed. And the kicker to all of this? You profession is as a dentist.Such is the story which we are told of in _The Whole Nine Yards_This is a good example of a Dark Comedy, it's not as Dark as _A Simple Plan_, or _Suicide Kings_ but it still is a dark comedy, and a funny one at that.I can defintiely reccomend this movie."
4,A surprisingly good comedy,"This movie was actually surprisingly funny with a good cast including Matthew Perry, Bruce Willis, Michael Clarke Duncan and Amanda Peet. The plot is centered around a dentist living in Canada named Oz (Matthew Perry) whose wife is crazy. Their marriage isn't at all a happy one. And then one day, Oz gets a new neighbor. He goes over to greet him, and finds out that his name is Jimmy Tudeski (Bruce Willis). He then realizes that Jimmy ""the tulip"" is a contract killer. So, obviously, Oz is freaked out now.What's funny about the movie is how scared Oz is of Jimmy. He's always nervous and quite scared and makes really strange remarks. It's a funny movie that will deliver plenty of laughs. Willis, Perry, Duncan, and Kevin Pollak all deliver great laughs. A good cast, an original plot and many funny moments make this comedy a winner."
1,Don't Bother,"This movie is just awful. Matthew Perry is not an actor; he plays the role of Matthew Perry. Rosanna Arquette has never shown herself to be more than a pretty face and her acting here was atrocious.... the fake French accent was, to put it mildly, distracting.Several reviewers here have bored us recounting the movie ""storyline"" which I found weak and predictable. The characters are not credible and the movies' dialogue should embarrass the film writers.The movie is billed as a comedy but I didn't get so much as a single chuckle.I find no redeeming value in this movie."
3,Good morning Mr. Next Door Neigbor Hit Man,"Matthew Perry (Tv's Friends, Fools Rush In) plays dentist Oz who meets his new next door neighbor who just happens to be hitman Jimmy ""The Tulip"" Tudeski, played by Bruce Willis (Sin City, Pulp Fiction). Perry soon becomes friends with Willis and ends up getting involved with his wife, Nastacha Henstridge (Maximum Risk, Adrenelin: Fear The Rush) and the 2 end up in love. Bad dude Yanni Gogalak, played by the hilarious Kevin Pollack (Stolen Summer, The Usual Suspects) wants Willis dead. Soon, havoc breaks loose at the end with a climatic shootout and some Amanda Peet (Whipped, Saving Silverman) being skin and yeah, but its funny and different. Michael Clarke Duncan (Sin City, Armageddon), Harland Williams (Half Baked, There's Something About Mary) and Rosanna Arquette (CRASH '96) also star. Followed in 2004 by The Whole Ten Yards which should of been scrap metal and not even been made."
3,Bruce breaks into comedy,Bruce proves he can be a great straight man in this film. One of the better films to come from the cast of TV's 'Friends.' Very easy on the reality.
1,Poor performance by Bruce man !!,"I like Bruce Willis and I think he has searched the trash cans for this one. It came from the bottomless pit of rubbish movies, this one fits in with the Deuce Bigalow rubbish. Don't worry about wasting your money on this one."
2,Review of DVD features,"I felt like I was watching an extended sitcom and if that's what you're looking for, you'll like this film. I won't belabor the film; others have done that well enough. I'll just concentrate on the DVD features. The DVD didn't have much in the way of extras. The interviews lasted less than 5 minutes per person. I didn't see a `Gag reel'. I must have missed it? The trailer is just about standard now for DVDs. The commentary by the director was interesting, pointing out tidbits like when lines were improvisation. Overall, I didn't see anything that made me want this in my collection. I'd say unless you loved the film I wouldn't bother."
2,Good Comedy turned Bad!,"This movie started off with great laughs and decent acting, but after the first half an hour it went downhill. I would maybe rent this, but do not buy this movie. You have been warned!"
3,BAD I WAS SUPRISED !,"I EXPECTED ALOT MORE FROM THIS MOVIE.I THOUGHT IT WOULD OF BEEN GOOD CAUSE BRUCE WILLIS IS IN IT.I LIKE BRUCE WILLIS AND I FIGURED THIS MOVIE WAS GOING TO BE GOOD TOO,BUT I WAS WRONG.THIS MOVIE IS ONE OF BRUCES WORST.IF THE STORY HAD MORE ACTION BEHIND IT AND THE MOVIE WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER.THE STORY IN THIS MOVIE IS FUNNY MEANING ""FUNNY ACTS"" BY THE ACTOR ""MAT PERRY"".DON'T BUY THIS MOVIE IT'S TOTALLY NOT WORTH YOUR MONEY.IF YOU DO WANT TO OWN THIS MOVIE THEN DUB IT FROM A FRIEND OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT."
1,Which way u going?,"This is a film full of hard to believe situations. Bruce Willis, how long time has been for you since the hit TV Series ""Moonlight"" as a fabolous comedy actor! His best performance until the ""Whole Nine Yards"". Matthew Perry, in another above the average role, in another mediocre film as he does in ""Fools Rush In"". ... . Try to find another comedy, this is a time waste for the average person, or most fitted for the above the average mind."
1,Absolutely miserable.,"This is the first movie I have rented in many years that I had to stop watching mid-way through because it was so bad. It just wasn't funny. Matthew Perry is a very tiresome individual to watch at the best of times and this was no exception. Not one of the characters was remotely appealing, I couldn't have cared less what happened to any of them. The humor seemed to be targeted at people who would enjoy a movie like Goonies. Boring, childish rubbish. If Amazon offered a ""zero stars"" rating, I'd have given it that."
1,Avoid at all costs,This simply an awful movie. The script is paper thin and completely unbelievable. Nearly all the gags fall short and the characters are all generally unlikable. I can't think of one redeeming quality. This movie is an undoubtedly a huge waste of time.
3,Better than I expected,"With the exception of Arquette's painfully bad imitation of a French Canadian accent ""The Whole Nine Yards"" is a pleasant and sometimes very funny movie. Instead of just reprising his Chandler role from ""Friends"" as is usual, Matt Perry produces an intensely anxious and tormented character that made me laugh out loud at least twice. The rest of the cast is good for a chuckle and they make up for the unecessarily convoluted plot."
5,"""OH MY GOD""","IT WAS ONE OF THE FUNNIEST VIEDOS I'VE SEEN IN A LONG TIME.MY DAD (FORMER SAN FRANCISCO GIANT COACH-93)AND I WATCHED IT WITH THE REST OF MY FAMILY(7,21/2 AND 7 MO.OLD AND MY MOM)WITH MY HUSBAND.WE LAUGHED SO HARD, WE THOUGHT IT WAS THE FUNNEST MOVIE WE HAVE SEEN IN SUCH A LONG TIME. I THINK THE ACTERS WE SUCH A MATCH,AND THEY WERE SO GREAT ON THE SCREEN.I SO ENJOYED THE MOVIE,I COULD NOT STOP LAUGHING.IT WAS WONDERFUL,FUNNY AND GREAT ACTING.GOOD JOB. ALETA JOYNER"
4,Did I have to see her nude?,This was such a hilarious show. I laughed so hard at Matthew Perry (at his best) and Bruce Willis. Right when the plot starts to thicken though there are several minutes of this naked woman. Why do filmakers think we want to see that all the time? It's not like this is a romance or even an action film. It's a comedy! I would've given it five stars if she'd kept her clothes on or even if they'd moved the camera to a position where you got the idea but didn't have to see it.
3,Bruce Willis and Two Great Sets of Teeth,"Amoral. Senseless. Some laughs. Two beautiful young woman who show great teeth in fairly numerous closeups. Two semi-nude shots of one of the women or her body stand in. A henpecked dentist to serve as the klutzy but basically heroic good guy. Assorted third bananas only one of whom makes sufficient screen impact to be noticed (Michael Clarke Duncan).Oh, yes, there is Bruce Willis, the only reason for the picture. He performs his patented cool tough guy character with nonchalance. Mix the ingredients without too much directorial skill and you have a movie which entertained many.Frankly, I liked looking at the girls."
2,Worst Jonathan Lynn's Film,"Been an avid follower of Jonathan Lynn's movies since the highly hilarious and excellent ""My Cousin Vinny""...and is sad to say that this is probably the worst movie ever directed by this him (major snags in the script didn't help either)! For laughs, I recommend his earlier works - ""My Cousin Vinny"",""A Distinguished Gentlemen"" or ""Sgt Bilko"" instead."
4,Misleading But Pleasing,"""The Whole Nine Yards"" was different than the trailers suggest, in my opinion. Sure it was about a hitman moving next door to a dentist, but the storyline is very different from what you may think. Bruce Willis, being my favorite actor, I naturally checked this one out. Matthew Perry does a great job playing an on-the-edge dentist in a dysfunctional marriage. Bruce Willis plays Jimmy ""The Tulip"" Tudeski, a former professional hitman who moves in next door to Matthew Perry. Matthew Perry almost instantly recognizes him and starts to get a little paranoid. Performances by Amanda Peet & Natasha Henstridge also make this a must-see. Amanda Peet gives a semi-funny performance as Matthew Perry's receptionist who is more than meets the eye. I liked the movie but I didn't find it incredibly funny, as it was marketed as a comedy. If you laugh easily as semi-funny jokes then you'll love this movie. If you just wanna see a great movie with an all-star cast, you'll love this movie."
5,character assassination,"""The Whole Nine Yards"" is pure comedy. It's such a crazed, in your face story that you can't help but laugh out loud every time you watch it. I think the funniest thing about this movie has gotta be Rosanna Arquette's ludicrous accent. It was as bad as her acting. Bruce Willis was adorable as Jimmy ""The Tulip."" He's a hitman who just wants a little happiness but gets mixed up with his neighbor. And I don't think I have ever seen Bruce look hotter than when he did when he wore that wife beater with silver crucifix. Matthew Perry (as Oz) was the perfect vinegar to Bruce's oil because the man was the total reverse as Jimmy. If you don't take everything so seriously and don't mind a few random shootings mixed with lots of laughs than this movie is for you."
2,Only for Amanda Peet fans,"Amanda Peet steals the show as a perky wannabe hit-woman. The remaining characters, including Willis' and Perry's were mostly one-dimensional cliches completely lacking chemistry with each other. Since it was clearly a spoof, and the plot was amusing, the lack of characterization would have been forgivable if not for the overbearing soundtrack. It was far too loud and drowned out the dialog throughout most of the movie -- without this it would have been 3 stars."
3,Ok for a time killer.,I know a lot of people will not agree with me but I just did not think the film was that funny. Yes there were some funny moments but nothing that made me roll around on the floor bellowing with laughter. The plot for those of you who do not know is a hitman with a price on his head moves in next door to Mathew Perry and the wackiness ensues.
3,"O.K., but not the best","I am a huge fan of both Willis and Perry, but I'm not the biggest fan of this movie. While there are quite a few funny moments, they are few and far between. It seemed as though the writers had written some funny stuff, and then came up with some boring lines to act as filler. The instant love between Perry and the blond woman, wasn't believable. Rosanna Arquette's accent was absolutely hideous. The only redeemable quality, was Amanda Peet as the hygienist turned hit man. She was very funny. This movie is o.k. I wouldn't buy it, if you want to see it, rent it, or wait for it to come on t.v."
2,"Storyline is Good, Script Could've Used Better Jokes","THE WHOLE NINE YARDS * * Story has a lot of good twists and turns, but the so-called comedy is barely there, save for a lot of Matthew Perry slapstick. Amanda Peet is amusing as the dental assistant who really wants to be a hitwoman."
3,What's all the hype about?,"I remember when The Whole Nine Yards hit the big screens. Everyone was hyping it all up, saying ""You gotta see this movie!"". Well I waited until it came out on DVD, I don't see what all the hype's about? Don't get me wrong, it was a funny movie, but not as funny as everyone had mentioned. It had a good ensemble. It was good to see Bruce Willis and Michael Clarke Duncan team up again. It also has Matthew Perry, Rosanna Arquette & Natasha Henstridge. The story line was great. Something new would unfold as the story went on. It's one of those movies that you have to sit and watch, otherwise you'll miss something. Matthew Perry plays a dentist that lives in the suburbs of Canada with his wife (played by Arquette) that can't stand him and wants to kill him. Bruce Willis plays a hitman that moves right next door to Perry. Not to ruin the story, everyone wants to kill each other, but in humoristic taste. It's a good movie, but not great!"
4,"I actually laughed. My God, I actually Laughed.","I don't really know why I hate myself for liking this, but I do. It doesn't have any of the right ingredients for a funny or likeable film. I mean, it's a Friends Cast Film, for Crissakes! But, Perry is funny. Necessary, as well. He'll survive, and I truly belive that, as his sens eof comic timing is impeccable. And that saves this film. It's worth watching to see the Steering Wheel bit at the start alone! Ummm... There isn't much else I can say. I feel all embarrased now. Stop looking at me."
3,A perfectly executed comedy/crime flick,"In my opinion, THE WHOLE NINE YARDS is a perfectly executed comedy/crime flick. I thought that Jill (Amanda Peet) looked VERY beautiful in the clothing she wore right after having been in the nude. The one thing that scared me about this movie was some of the violence -- Especially the fight between Frankie (Michael Clarke Duncan) and Oz (Matthew Perry) when Oz first got to his hotel room. I was kind of surprised when I discovered that Frankie was sitting in Oz's hotel room waiting for him. To me, Cynthia (Natasha Henstridge) looked VERY beautiful in everything she wore -- Especially the dress she wore when she first showed up in the film. In conclusion, I HIGHLY recommend this perfectly executed smash hit that goes all the way to all you Bruce Willis or Matthew Perry fans out there who have not seen it."
5,Funny Movie!,"I liked, this movie a friend, suggested that I should, see this I did I liked, this pretty silly I loved it. Bruce Willis and, Matthew Perry were good well this is a movie you, should watch!"
2,"GOOD, FUNNY MOVIE!","I thought that, as with Matthew Perrys' other movie outing that I've seen,( The ABISMAL 'Fools Rush In') that all this movie would end up being is another 'Matthew Perry, playing Chandler in a movie' with a bad script. I was pleasantly surprised. Although Perry DOES ham it up a bit but not in 'Chandler' mode! There are a couple of genuinely hilairious moments, look out for when he leaves for work on the first day - its a masterpiece! The story is not the strongest, ever, but it has its moments. It is very basic story formula: Matt Perrys' character is hated by his wife Bruce willis' character moves in next door( he is a hitman) Matt Perry gets thrown around. A lot. Thats all you really need to know. This film is quite predictable, but on a whole, a good evenings' entertainment. If you like Friends, youll LOVE this movie."
3,Enjoyable,"""The Whole Nine Yards"" is a good film, it's just not as funny as it could have been. The actors in the film (including Bruce Willis, Mathew Perry, etc.) seem to have had a lot of fun making this film, and it's fun to watch as well, but a lot of the humor seems forced and a bit unoriginal.Some scenes, however, are hilarious, and Amanda Peet's over-the-top performance alone makes this film worth seeing. It's not the funniest film you'll see (or even get close for that matter), but it's a good film worth seeing."

2,Downfall of Bruce Willis!,"The trailor of this movie made me believe that this movie is not to be missed..! But frankly the best of the movie is only what you see in the trailor and the remaining is very poor!The downfalls of this movie in my opinion are as follows: 1. Lack of action. 2. Lack of drama. 3. Weak story. 4. Lack of humor. 5. Lack entertainment!Bruce Willis had so many successful roles but not in this one... not because his acting was bad but the whole movie is weak. You cannot compare this movie to Robert De Niro's ""Analyze This"" at all.The idea of the story is fine but how the story develops and takes place makes the movie weak.If you are looking for a nice commedy, go and buy Robert De Niro's ""Analyze This"" instead!"
1,TRANSPARENT AND BORING,"This was possibly the worst film I have had the ""pleasure"" to view this year. Perry is a very tiring actor to watch in the first place and his efforts to go from the small screen to the big screen just shows that the transistion is almost always disasterous. The movie contains absolutely no suprises or genuine laughs, I found myself forcing a smile so I wouldn't feel this DVD was a total waste, but in the long run I couldn't fool my face into smiling. I think Bruce Willis was using this film merely to make a paycheck. ""Hit Man"" humor may on the surface look funny but this movie didn't work. I can see why it bombed at the Box Office. I love Amazon.COM and buy all my books and DVD's from here, but I would strongly urge anyone from buying this DVD. Wait until it comes on T.V., its NOT EVEN WORTH A PRICE OF RENTAL!"
2,Jump!??,"My little girl LOVES Elmo! But this was as much an excercise/movement video as any Sesame Street episode. I was hoping for a video that demonstrated some movements that my daughter could mimic. The only movement was jumping. We watched Elmo watch Grover jump. We watched Grover learn how to jump. We watched a commercial about jumping. We watched someone sing a song about jumping....... are you seeing a pattern? We did a lot of WATCHING. I wanted a little more DOING.My daughter can do more than jump. Even though she is only 20 months old, she is capable of more. But she did enjoy WATCHING this DVD."
2,Not good for a group,I think there are better exercise videos out there. My group of preschoolers were bored with this after the third or fourth time they were made to jump! It might be okay for one or two children in the home but definately not for a group setting. I even fast-forwarded and it didn't really have a lot of exercising throughout the video. I am glad I got this video used and only paid like 3 dollars.
2,Couch Potato,This exercise video entices you to SIT on the couch and learn how to have fun exercising and eating healthy. The best part of this video is the growth chart on the front that you put on the wall.
1,Intolerable Cruelty to watch this movie!,"This was by far the worst movie I saw at the cinema last year. Being honest, I wouldn't watch it again if someone paid me, let alone pay for the DVD. The plot is not a particulaly gripping one, and there are lots of cheesy unfunny 'jokes' played repetedly throughout. Catherine Zeta Jones needs to get a refund from her acting school, and George Clooney was better in his ER days.If you are seriously looking for a laugh, I recommend forgetting about this DVD and spending a few more dollars on the Curb Your Enthusiasm, Season 1 box set. - Trust me, it will be worth it in the long run!"
2,Intolerably Not Funny,"I saw it today. Sorry I wasted the time. Could have been funny, had a good story line and plot. I only chuckled once when a thug mistook a gun for an asthma inhaler (not giving too much away, I hope.) This movie was more of an outline than a fleshed out story, I felt. The Coen brothers have not made a decent comedy since ""Raising Arizona"" which was classically hilarious. Even ""Fargo"" (which I loved) was funnier than ""Intolerable Cruelty."" The Coens are either very good, or very, very baaaaaaad! I give it two stars for CZJ's beauty (however she seemed to be sleepwalking through this film) and clothes and the gorgeous mansions.A good one to rent on a rainy day when you've rented everything else."
1,Worst movie ever,"Worst movie ever. Do I need to say more? Boring. Weird plot twists that don't make any sense. And what is up with the old man boss? Just dumb. Cheesy lines. ""*gasp* you're exposed."" Lame lame lame. Thats an hour and a half I won't get back."
3,The Chemistry Is Missing.,"This film seemed to be a modern version of the romantic comedies of the 50's & 60's. it was overloaded with dialogue, some sight gags, & a few well-timed sexual references provided the laughs. George Clooney plays divorce lawyer Miles Massey who is at a crossroads in his life. Catherine Zeta Jones plays Marilyn Rexroth who is divorcing her cheating husband. The latter appears immune to the formers charms. But soon, the predictable path to the films conclusion is clearly in sight. The courtromm scenes dragged & CZJ & GC simply lacked the sexual sparks that would have made this a four star film. I give it three stars because, the supporting cast of Julia Duffy, Billy Bob Thornton, & Cedric the entertainer provided the laughs. Perhaps, Anjelina Jolie & Brad Pitt would have pulled it off?"
4,Better than its reviews,"As a Coen Brothers movie (O Brother, Where Art Thou?), this is a 3-star movie but among all movies, it's a 4.There is a lot that happens beneath the average movie watcher's radar here (not a slam of movie watchers, I wish I were less critical of movies I watch and I wish I could just sit back and enjoy them). The movie is very good and is VERY Coen Brothers.If you're expecting a War of Roses movie, you'll like this better than you expect. If you're expecting a ha-ha funny movie, you'll be disappointed.The best part of the movie is watching the characters par, dance, jab, avoid, and complement each other throughout the scenes.Clooney is fun and he goes from slimeball lawyer to a likeable guy. Any movie that can do THAT is masterful! (Obviously this would never happen in read life!)"
1,Not good quality,The amazon sound qualuty not good. The sound volume was to the max but still you could not hear cery well
2,Is it supposed to be funny?,"Like a lot of other reviewers, this movie seems torn. The Coen brothers seemed to want to make a funny movie. There are some moments clearly designed to be funny. The movie has a lot of odd and absurd moments. Despite that, it isn't really a comedy. At times, it seems restrained in its humor, at other times the humor seems jarringly out of place. It's almost as if the Coen brothers' absurd style of humor and A-list actors like Clooney and Zeta-Jones just didn't mix. In the end, the film is just lifeless - except for Catherine Zeta-Jones, who looks gorgeous as always."
4,Coen Brothers: Film # 10,"I enjoyed this film as I found it entertaining and fun, but I was surprised. I was surprised because there was nothing much more to the film. Being that this film is a Coen Brother's film, I guess I was just expecting a little more umph to this film and in the end I just never got it. Sure there were fun scenes, which could only be from a Coen Brother's mind. There was also plenty of twists as well, but for me the twists were obvious and practical next steps to the storyline.In the end, and as I really recall the film now, I did like this film a lot, but there was just something missing. What this ""something"" is, I just can't put my finger on."
3,Cynical fun,"A cynical, fun movie. It is dependent on the idea of marrying people for the money that you will receive in the eventual divorce settlement (50% in California). Maybe better as a rental than a purchase as I am not sure that I will watch it again."
1,What were Catherine and George thinking???,"How could I not like a movie with Catherine Zeta-Jones and George Clooney...I think the answer is when the movie is called ""Intolerable Cruelty"". Well one thing is for sure...the title says it all. This movie is not only intolerable but it seems cruel to be so stupid. There are many recognizable actors in this movie which surprised me. Billy Bob Thornton makes an appearance and he is probably is the most fun and likeable character in the whole movie. WARNING: THIS MOVIE HAS NO PLOT, NO CLIMAXES, NO FUNNY MOMENTS, NOTHING, NADA, ZIP! Unless you have absolutely nothing else to do with your time, DO NOT WASTE IT ON THIS MOVIE! And please, Catherine and George and Billy Bob...I love ya'll but think again if approached for a sequal."
3,"Good cast, design, music; not much of a script","There is a great cast here, nice music by Carter Burwell, and lovely production design. The problem is the script, which suffers for the same reason that the one for The Hudsucker Proxy did: the Coens wrote it with other people. When the brothers work only with each other, they produce better work. When working with a writing team, the script suffers."
3,"Not great, but good for a few laughs.","Granted, this isn't the Coens' best work. But it does have its moments of comic delight. You'll enjoy it if you don't expect too much from it. Besides, you could do much work, like renting anything with The Rock in it."
2,So So,"There were a few laugh out loud moments, especially with Billy Bob Thornton, but this is an ultimately forgettable movie. Clooney and Jones never realy click, although she is nice to look at. I expect better from the Coen Brothers. Well, maybe next time. This is worth a rental if you want something light and sappy, but I would not advise buying it."
2,"Lots of beauty, absolutely no chemistry","What a disappointment this was. I thought, with the Cohens, Clooney and Zeta-Jones, how could this go wrong? But it does go very, very wrong. Seems like this film was rushed and patched together. I love screwball comedy and fantasy fable, but this is a pale attempt at either, for some reason. Seems like a film that started with great intentions and the best in the business, but just falls so flat. What happened? Clooney and Jones have no chemistry at all. None. No spark, nothing. She underplays the role to the point of being bland, like she'd rather be anyplace else than on the set of this film. He seems to be trying too hard to pull this all together. For some reason, this just never does jell. Can't decide if it's the script, the acting, the production - don't know. Too bad, could have been spectacular if it had worked."
1,A failed screwball comedy,"The biggest problem with this comedy is it never gets funny.Characters that are overdrawn, but not creatively. And Zeta-Jones is totally wooden.Clooney Miles Massey is so ridiculous as to not be funny.Jones as Marilyn Rexroth is so predictable that there is no drama in the plot. You could see the whole plot 10 minutes into the film. A couple of surprise twists would have added a lot, but you are given too much at the opening.A much better choice would be Steve Martin's ""The Man with Two Brains"""
1,Bad film,"When I saw the names of George Clooney and Catherine Zeta-Jones together in the cast I knew from the first moment it was going to be a fail. George Clooney is one of those actors that make you smile, laugh or leave you serious. He can be in a comedy or in a drama. But this is not one of his best performances maybe becaue the female starring isn't a comic actor. In this film Catherine Zeta-Jones shows no sympathy, she's always serious, forcing the smile, cold and manipulative as usual. She can't make you -at least-, provoke a smile in your face. The plot of the film is ridiculous and it has some annoying things like the old boss in his office. I still don't understand the role of Billy Bob Thornton. The only good thing is the trial where we see some hilarious moments. Save your money and your time for a better movie."
1,zzzzz!,"Bored me to tears. Spending valubale 90 minutes on this kind of rubbish can make you cry even more. The so called ""romantic comedies"" from US are usually a pretty bad lot and this one is a among the worst examples of the genre."
1,Intolerable Cruelty,"Intolerable Cruelty is a good name for this movie, it was horrible. There was no chemistry between the actors, and the plot was laid out in the first fiveteen minutes. It didn't keep me guessing, and I am very glad that I only rented it."
3,Cute farcical fluff,"The key to enjoying this movie is to forget that the Coen brothers are involved. It is little like the rest of their work and does not compare, it is not of the same ilk as their other works. It works great, though, as a light farce, as long as you don't take it too seriously and don't expect too much. I thought Zeta-Jones did a great job, very funny. I thought Clooney was only ""ok,"" passable, but someone better could have improved this somewhat. As the film goes on, it gets more and more ridiculous, but I think that was the intent. The fast dialog between the two main characters is very funny, the script does have a few high points.This is not something I would ever watch a second time. But if it comes on cable and you have little else to do, it will be a fun and entertaining 2 hours or so and you will be pleasantly surprised given the horrible reviews it got. For what it is, a very light farce, it's delightful for one viewing."
3,"OK movie, but disc problems","The movie was really nothing spectacular. Catherine Zeta-Jones, George Clooney and the rest of the cast perform very well. This movie was very enjoyable, however, I won't add it to my collection.The reason why is the studio making this disc not only puts previews in the beginning of this disc, but there is no ""menu"" or ""skip"" button you can use to get past the coming attractions. You are forced to either watch the previews or fast-forward through them EVERY time.Boo to the studio."
2,A big disappointment,"This movie has the right pedigree - Coen brothers, George Clooney, throwback genre - but it plays surprisingly flat, its subpar script and forced performances pointing to the same issue: A general lack of conviction.OK, Catherine Zeta-Jones is mostly on message, and Billy Bob Thornton gets into the right spirit. But otherwise the characters are thin (or just plain annoying) and the actors overcompensate by playing up the offbeat, perhaps thinking that quirkiness is all it takes to make a Coen brothers movie. The tone here is set by Clooney, who can't seem to decide whether he's in The Philadelphia Story or O Brother Where Art Thou? His broad touches might work better if this were a funnier movie, but here he's just trying too hard.Though they wrote it - or at least punched it up - this script doesn't do the Coen brothers right. Alas, they seem to know it, and so do their performers."
3,Choppers,"It actually is an intriguing idea that the iconoclast brothers Coen would choose to direct/write/produce a big splashy, star driven Romantic Comedy in the tradition of ""Desk Set"" or other such Hepburn/Tracy vehicle. But though George Clooney, playing a high paid, dissatisfied with life lawyer, gives it most of his all as does his nemesis Catherine Zeta-Jones, as an often married gold digger looking to score big once and for all, they never do reach the Nirvana that Hepburn and Tracy or Grant and Doris Day do, which is surprising because they both look great: sexy and sensual but exhibit very little tangible electricity between them.There are a couple of good bits: one involving a creepy, dilettante ""Baron"" and his Pomeranian testifying in court but mostly, ""Intolerable Cruelty"" is smile and grin time viewing: not bad, but no cigar."
1,What a BOMB !!!!!,"What a piece of drivel. I was really looking forward to seeing Zeta-Jones and Clooney in this movie because the previews made it look like they had great chemistry. Boo, hiss!!!! This could have been condensed into a half hour episode of a below-par sitcom.Instead of more subtle humor, which might have helped this movie, the viewers are hit over the head with the silly slapstick.It was so boring, so absurd, and the only good chemistry between Marilyn and Miles was in the scenes that were shown in the previews. The Coen brothers sure laid an egg this time around! Even all the stars in this movie could not make it palatable or anything but trite."
1,Great actors... not a great movie!,Too bad! I was hoping to love this movie. I thought that Zeta-Jones and Clooney would be a hit together. This movie was a bore. Very predictable and slow going at that! The actors looked great but the movie script made me question the quality of films that these two well liked actors are appearing in.
1,A CINEMA DISSASTER,JOIN IT WITH AFLECK-LOPEZ GIGLI AND THEY'LL GET THE COPPER GLOBE AWARD FOR THE WORST MOVIES OF THE YEAR!!!!!!!!!WHAT A FILM WASTE IN TERMS OF QUALITY. IF YOU JUST WANT TO SEE ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL WOMEN ON THE PLANET ....RUN AND RENT A COPY....
2,Not Good,This movie is not really good at all - very dated.and very clown like humor. Thumbs down. Would not recommend.
3,Okay movie.,This movie is fun. but it's just okay. Not a really great movie. I'd rather watch something better for the time spent.
2,Intolerable Language,"George Clooney and Cathryn Zeta-Jones did a remarkably good job with the script; however, it's disturbing to think someone who has passed the bar, becoming a lawyer, would fancy a woman of her character's caliber. I'm rating this movie with only two stars. The language was not family friendly. PG-13...I don't think so...not in my house and we are all over 21! Clean it up Hollywood!! Educated and upstanding people don't talk like that!"
5,Intolerable Cruelty,"This is a modern day ""War of the Roses"", except with a happy, loving ending. Crafted as only a Coen Brothers film could be.....dark comedy at its best. A must own classic."
4,A Fantastic Commentary On California.,This movie WOWed me for the first half of the film. The Coen Brothers with their wit and irony show us from a blatantly obvious point of view what life has become for many residents of Los Angeles and the areas surrounding. The relationship in the movie seems to fall apart at the end... One can almost tell which part of the movie was done by which film maker and who had say in what... All in all I'd say the Coen Brothers should stick with themselves.
1,A poor movie - very disappointing!,This movie promised so much but delivered so little. It was a very poor movie and a major disappointment! Avoid at all costs!
5,Catherine Zeta-Jones!,"What an average movie ""Intolerable Cruelty"" is! But wow! Five stars for Catherine Zeta-Jones! She married whoever she wanted and got paid! Miles Massey (George Clooney) was a bumbling divorce attorney who liked to get women rich. That was pretty shallow and the rest of the movie felt out-of-place with its lame humor and lack of Geoffrey Rush. Cedric the Entertainer was hardly in it as a private investigator who liked to nail people's behinds. The old guy in charge of Massey's firm was grotesquely ugly with his ventilator and the dark chamber office. Overall this movie was mean and conniving, but at least Catherine Zeta-Jones looked good! Shake it like a salt shaka!"
1,Absolute Tripe!,I guess along with Mars Attacks this movie rates as one of the worst I've ever seen. This is proof positive that no matter how much star power you have it is still no substitute for good writing. As others before me have pointed out the main characters simply have no chemistry and this is not for a lack of trying. Though they might attempt to exchange smoldering looks the result is flat and utterly uninspiring. How can you feel anything for a money grubbing woman who makes a career out of divorce and an equally shallow but 'savvy' attorney who despite being smitten by his client's wife is still too dumb to see through this transparent plot! The whole time my wife and I watched this disaster we could not help but comment it looked like a movie made by Hollywood insiders for Hollywood insiders. Is this supposed to be some sort of social commentary on Beverly Hills matrimonial life? If so I didn't care before and I still don't care now.
1,How did this dreck EVER ger released?,"Next time hire a writer. Or someone who's able to gauge when a movie is so badly botched, that it should never see the inside of a public theatre. The California law was wrong--the technical aspects of the plot had as many holes; and sounded as phony, as hollow to the ear, as the storyline.Reviewers before me have parsed this failure sufficiently; I'll simply suggest that if you're looking for a black comedy about divorce, try ""War of the Roses."""
1,DVD did not work,"The movie DVD I bought was sealed and everything...but it did not play. I tried to make it work on numerous machines (DVD player, laptops) but it did not work on any."
1,Intolerable Cruelty is spending 2 hours watching this!,"I had looked forward to seeing this movie because of the previews for it, however 45 min. into it both my wife and I knew we had made a mistake! There is zero chemistry between any of the actors, very little humor, and a pathic plot! The only 2 bright spots of this movie are Cedric the Entertainer and Billy Bob Thornton, but together they are in less then 15 min. of the movie."
1,Woeful unfunny movie! Truly awful!,Considering the talent involved in this piece of rubbish I thought it would be decent. But it was a woeful and unfunny mess. Truly awful.
3,Let go of your intelligence - let the camp begin!,"If you can just relax and go with the campy feeling of the movie, you'll enjoy it! It's not a great movie, but it's not supposed to be. It's funny, if you let yourself go and just go along for the ride. The chemistry between Zeta-Jones and Clooney is fantastic. Geoffrey Rush is a surprise as a buffoon television producer. I had a ball with the film - my boyfriend didn't."
4,Coens' attempt to revive 40s screwball comedies,"The Coen brothers got their hands in this revival of 1940s screwball comedies late and managed to bring it to life. Though it is not a perfect film, George Clooney and Catherine Zeta-Jones do a fine job as sparring divorce attorney Miles Massey and golddigger-with-a-plan Marylin Rexroth. There are lots of twists and turns and a very good supporting cast, including Billy Bob Thornton and Geoffrey Rush. DVD extras include a 12-minute making-of featurette, a 5-minute look at the wardrobe, outtakes, cast and filmmaker info, and a number of features available for your computer. The film can be heard in English, French or Spanish and optional subtitles are available in French or Spanish. Fun and entertaining."
2,intolerable cruelty,"It seems hollywood has ran out of ideas and good script.this is why Oscar is going to a lot of foreigners.the script was so poor that if it was not for the names ofthe actors, I doubt anybody would want to see it.Not even funny.my wife fell sleep watching it on DVD."
2,Quite 'intolerable'.,"I think the title of this fits it quite well. I find it amusing. I saw the previews for this on TV and it looked good, so I decided to rent it. I hated it from the beginning. It was really, really boring. I thought for sure that this was going to be a great romantic comedy, but I found nothing in this to be funny OR romantic. I noticed the chemistry between George Clooney and Catherine Zeta-Jones, but they barely went anywhere with it. They had one 'romantic' scene and that's about it. I was left wondering what in the heck went wrong there. There could have been a lot more done with this movie, too bad they didn't take a different approach and have a great love affair between Clooney and Zeta-Jones. They are both beautiful people, but this movie doesn't do it for either of them. If you decide to watch this, proceed with caution. I would NOT buy this. Rent it, if anything."
3,A bit of treacle,"With stars of the caliber of George Clooney, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Geoffrey Rush and Billy Bob Thornton and writers like the Coen brothers, INTOLERABLE CRUELTY seemed to have everything going for it. The problem with this fairly funny script is that the story itself is so hackneyed and dull and, actually insulting to the intelligence of the audience, that it crashes and burns. Over-decorated, banal pastiche that even the quality of the performers can't salvage. Maybe it will play better as a DVD rental......."
2,The Intolerable Cruelty is watching this film,"From the previews, this one actually seemed interesting. I loved George Clooney in ""One Fine Day"" (another romantic comedy) and Catherine Zeta-Jones in ""Chicago"", so I figured I'd give this one a shot. I was very disappointed.For me, there were hardly any parts throughout the film that made me laugh. Both actors played their roles skillfully, but I thought the script could've been better. This movie, in my opinion, is very bland and unsatisfying. I think it's one of the stupidest movies I've ever seen, to be honest.The intolerable cruelity of the film is you watching it.This film didn't live up to its potential and I'm not going to add it to my movie collection anytime soon. If you want a real romantic comedy, see ""Sleepless In Seattle"", ""One Fine Day"" or ""You've Got Mail""."
2,L.A. Comedy,"This is another one of those comedies that makes you wonder if the people living in Los Angeles are familiar with the world as the rest of us know it. The movie is funny but the premise is pretty ""out there"". Once you get past accepting the premise that the sole reason people, mostly women, marry is to get a good divorce settlement you can appreciate the idea that we should all be giddy that Miles, the foremost in divorce attorneys, has fallen in love and wants to marry Madeline whose original goal of soaking him for the usual good divorce settlement has gone awry because she has fallen in love with him too. Past that, there are a lot of chuckles and both Clooney and the female lead are very attractive actors."
3,watered-down Coen Bros.,"This film will be seen by movie buffs who recognize the producer/ director team known as the Cohen Brothers. These are the same folks who brought us Fargo and the smash O, Brother Where Art Thou?In comparison, Intolerable Cruelty lacks the edge and sophistication of their previous work. There are some impossibly absurd characters that add color, but overall this is light-weight fare that doesn't quite satisfy."
1,turn the sound off,"This movie is so dumb that it's as good with the sound off as with the sound on. The only reason to watch it is to observe the extreme beauty of both leads. A plot as old as the written word could still form the basis of an OK movie with a good script, but this script has no charm, no wit, no nothing."
1,Intolerable Cruelty ? more Like Intolerable Movie,"No fancy write up here, but just the facts. I sat through ten minutes of this movie and knew I had made a mistake. After suffering through many bad plot ""twists"" we finally came to the end. Which wasn't too bad actually. BECAUSE YOU KNEW IT WAS OVER! So if you are looking for a good movie or just something to watch, turn on the tube! Because this movie is one that lives up to it's name""Intolerable Cruelty """
1,"Such potential, and yet so bad","With the sleek talents of Clooney and Zeta-Jones, one would think that this movie would be a surefire hit. It's not. The writing fails miserably, letting down what could have been fabulous chemistry. Too many random screams... too repetitive. Quite a shame considering the serious talent casted for the movie. Try again, Catherine and George, but fire the sceenwriter."
1,Not Funny,"This movie was suppose to be a comedy. I did not laugh once. I love George Clooney, but in this movie his acting was poor (too many facial expressions). Catherine looked great however, her character was awful. The movie was not what I expected."
1,"Oh my, where to begin",Where to begin? I don't know but not with this movie. I found myself totally unentertained to the point that I actually fell asleep during this movie. That is something that I just don't do. Catherine Zeta Jones was beautiful but George Clooney was a mess. I didn't find any events enough to really peak my attention. This movie alone has gotten me off the habit of simply buying the disk before I see the film.
3,against all odds,"An entertaining but hardly ""classic"" Coen brothers vehicle. George Clooney is spectacular as the anti-love, cynical, fast talking divorce attorney, Miles Massey. Catherine Zeta Jones plays a cold, calculating witch who double crosses Massey. Zeta Jones is best in these kinds of roles. A somewhat funny film about double and triple crossing, with deceptive personalities inexplicably drawn together against all logic."
1,a BOMB!,"I am an enthusiastic Coen brothers fan, but couldn't get through this. Has to be their worst film yet!"
1,stupid is as stupid does,"Don't waste your time, I hate to see really good actors sell themselves out for lousy scripts."
1,don't waste your money,My hubby and I were looking for a light romantic comedy to watch one lazy evening. This was not it. I thought the movie was terrible. The characters were uninteresting and the plot never moved along. The film was just plain BORING!
2,intolerably too long,"the basic plot of the movie was okay, she's impossible to get, and he's determined to get her, but just when it seemed like it was over, there was another twist. the characters were not properly developed and by the last half hour, you're so bored by the length, you don't care if they live happily ever after."
4,Resending initial rating,"Yes you were absolutely correct that this was not your fault... but, you messed up when you wrote the last part of your statment ""The only error here does not seem to be ours"" I don't think this retort needed to be said.especially when you are requesting to get the purchaser to change there rating for you. Nope... it was not your fault that I receveid two books. The service was very good, I did receive the book before the dated deliver date.If you made a mistake and ordered 2 books, why am I the one being hurt by your rating? We will refund the book if you return it.Please remove the poor rating as we only did what we were told. You now seem unhappy with our service. The only error here does not seem to be ours."
5,"Yes, it is that good!","""Black tiger"" from 1982 is (together with the following ""Mean streak"") Y&T's finest effort. After an instrumental tune/intro ""From the moon"" the action really begin, and ""Open fire"" is a typical up tempo song by Y&T, similar to ""Mean streak"". The material is rather diverse and there's lighter and melodic tunes like ""Don't wanna lose"" (a real gem!) as well as fast rockers in the shape of ""Black tiger"". The bass driven ""Barroom boogie"" gives the album character and the captivating fan favourite ""Forever"" gives an example of a classic Y&T formula used on previous as well as following songs. ""Hell or high water"" shows Y&T's ability to be slow but still groovy and heavy without ending up like Dio on ""Strange highway"". The closing ""Winds of change"" is a ballad and `tho I'm not crazy about Y&T's ballads in general it's quite good. Highly recommended!"
2,Very poorly written,"This book does not explain the concepts clear enough for beginning electrical engineering students. There are examples, but they are not clear. Also, the book barely touches on the superposition theorem, but it does not mention the more widely used loop analysis method. I would not recommend this book for anyone."
2,"No, it's not...","All this seems to exist for is as a 'capsule' for the release of the ""Healthy Colours"" tracks, which really appear to be something more akin to a failed experiment in some of the methods which Eno would use more fruitfully with David Byrne, and which Fripp's solo works (viz ""The League of Gentlemen"") would employ to much better effect. The _real_ 'Essential Fripp and Eno' is actually the two original albums: ""No Pussyfooting"" and ""Evening Star"". Go there instead."
4,Healthy Colors is great - really!,"I just wanted to enter a dissenting view on the hitherto unreleased tracks - Healthy Colors 1-4. They are certainly very different in feel from the more sprawling ambient songs they recorded earlier but I find them the most exciting on the CD. They make the CD worth buying even for those who may have the other 2 Cds.It shows the influence of the funk beats that helped make "" My Life in the Bush of Ghosts"" so great. An dthere's abit of the motorik minimalism of the best Krautrock bands like Neu and Harmonia.To knock this for not having enough melody or variation misses the point. To borrow from Mark E. Smith, it's the three R's that make these tracks so good;""Repetition, Repetition, Repetition."""
2,Lesser effort,"I was excited when this came out, because I'd heard there was ""new material"" on it. Being a fan of the Fripp/Eno albums, I expected something interesting. The ""Healthy Colours"" material was a total disappointment. It was then, and it is now, just a bunch of noodling. To be more precise, all the ""Healthy Colours"" pieces sound (a) too Eno-dominated and (b) incomplete and lackadaisical. The high points here are the tracks reprised from the other two Fripp/Eno collaborations. Which brings up the question, why not just buy ""No Pussyfooting"" and ""Evening Star"" instead? And the answer to that is...well, you probably should. This can be missed."
2,Skip it,"Instead of buying this, invest your money in the originals--""(No Pussyfooting)"" and ""Evening Star"". Four versions of the marginally interesting, barely there ""Healthy Colours""! The only thing going for them are the vocal tape manipulations, which sound like a skipping CD. Otherwise, not worth it."
3,3.5 Stars,"Efficient and freezer friendly. A little on the flimsy side yet they are still keeping strong. I use them in the freezer keeping my yeast and vital gluten as active as possible. They are small enough where they do not interfere and demand too much space. Just as they are described, no more and no less, they deserve a 3.5 Stars easily, which is not bad at all for they did not cost too much and do the job they are supposed to be doing."
3,Good enough,The containers work fine for what I intended (ice cream) but are not as substantial as I'd expected. 1.5 pint size is perfect.
2,Fair,"I have long sought a replacement for Republic manufactured 1 qt containers that were available in the 1970-90's. These are a poor imitation. The guage of material is much thinner, so that when full there is a lot of flex. When filled with warm soup and picked up,l these containers wobble and flex so much I worry about the contents spilling out. The search continues. These might be fine for containing Cheerios."
5,Freezer friendly containers,"These are soft and seem flimsy on the counter but they freeze rigid without being brittle. I would say they appear very durable but I haven't dropped a filled frozen one yet and that's really the ultimate test! Quality really apparently when frozen - lids on lock down. Stack well.One comment on size, I was tempted to buy the larger quart size and I'm really glad I didn't. I've yet to come close to filling one making a batch of (for example) hummus and freezing half. Shows up much cooking a quart really is.You'll need to label these because when frozen you just can't see what's in them.I will be stocking up on this size when summer comes around."
5,STILL A GREAT SEASON,"I WISH THEY WERE MAKING MORE SEASONS BACK THEN, THE KIDS WERE GROWING UP, AND EVERYBODY ON THE SHOW KNEW THAT THIS WAS THERE LAST SEASON ON THE AIR. I GREW UP ON LITB WHEN I WAS A KID. I HOPE THAT EVERYONE WHO BUYS THIS SEASON WILL ENJOY IT ALOT. DESERVES MORE THAN 5 STARS....."
3,Somewhere between truth and fantasy,"I have a family member with autism. We see more and more of these people in film because sadly their numbers are increasing. I found Elizabeth Shue's performance fairly convincing although I must note there is a hollywood or fairy tale quality to the film. However I found the growing understanding of Molly about her own life, her own world and the world which her brother, Buck and other normal and typical folks inhabit thought provoking and real. I liked how the director depicted Molly's problems with sensory intergration issues trying to show the audience how difficult it is for folks with autism to function in the world and filter out the noise. I would have liked to have seen more time spent on how her brother dealt with his sister's disability prior to her surgury and after her retreat back from the normal typical world"
2,"Okay, it isn't very good...","But it isn't as bad as I'd anticipated. I'm a long time John Duigan fan, so I had to see it. And yes, this is a career low for him. But one of the major problems with this dvd is that it is using the studio cut of the movie, which removes about 20 minutes from the film. Is the movie any better with those 20 extra minutes? I don't know, but it does explain how some characters seem to just float through the movie. Their roles may have been reduced in the editing process. The movie is also just plain weird or goofy in certain sections (Molly's reaction when she sees the bodybuilders or when she wets her pants).Duigan is truly a gifted director: see Flirting, The Year My Voice Broke, or Sirens before judging his work or his capability. I just hope to heaven that he returns to writing his own films, as well as directing."
3,A mainstream but still low teck movie,I say this movie has good acting in it but it was the hole plot and the dioloug of this movie that did not help the story. It is not a boring movie but it is not entertaning I say if you want a basic movie with some emotion but a movie that dosent take your breath away I say you should rent this one.
4,Ford F-350,"Looks great. Easy to install. Reuses the reverse light. Ford's back-up light is of no help. I was Hoping this would improve this problem. It did not. Small complaint. No regrets, looks great."
1,A waste of my money,"I bought this product, but found that it did not work at all. Not as what it claimed. Wasteed my time and money. Simply warn people who is going to buy it.This is just few of the bad experience I had over online shopping. Most of time, I found that online products have pretty good quality."
1,Absolute junk,"I wholeheartedly agree with the reviewers that gave this book 1 star. From page 12, when the first class in the book (apImage) itself is incompletely defined (the definition ""pixels_"" is missing) it is a steep and fast ride downhill. This book is going to be returned -- this would be the first time I am returning a book."
5,a solid C++ software development book,"There are many books about C++, and there are many books about software development. This book is one of the best I've seen at combining the two topics. The authors are obviously real-world developers because they offer real-world solutions and approaches, unlike the authors of many development-oriented books who apparently live in ideal worlds where every project goes perfectly.C++ continues to be one of the most popular programming languages ever, and I highly recommend this book not only to any developer who writes C++ applications for a living, but also to team leaders and architects who want to make sure their teams are writing the best code possible. I can say based on years of experience that the techniques offered in this book are critically important for real-world, robust, production-quality C++ applications."
5,Awesome,"i love this map book, its easy to use and can really help if you get lost, you shouldn't leave home without one"
5,peter's review,I think you should read the monkey-monkey's trick by patricia Mckissack because it's a good book. In this story monkey-monkey needs a new house. I think you should read this book because the hyena was in a disgusise as the beautiful creature and the ugly monster and that's hyena tricking Monkey-monkey.By:Peter
3,Monkey-Monkey's Trick,This book is about a mischivious monkey whose always trying to play tricks on other animals. It has pictures that let the reader fully understand the book.
4,Don't Judge a Book by Its Cover,"I was very excited when I saw a new book would soon be available by Rosemary Rogers. However, when it arrived and I began reading it, I quickly saw that it was a reissue of the 1982 novel, with a new cover. Wish it had been a new book, one about Steve and Ginny."
1,italics all over the place!!!!,"I have never seen so many italics in one book in my entire life! It ruined the story completely, not to mention that some of the story was just plain confusing. I almost thought I needed to be on some kind of medication to read this thing."
5,FASTER,"You can see a lot of historical MotoGp and 500cc class pilots talking about everything you cant see on a TV transmision.Wayne Raine, Mick Doohan, Randy Mamola, Valentino Rossi, Max Biaggi, Nick Hyden, John Hopkings, and a lot pilots more will take you through this two DVD discs into the Formula one of bikes: MOTOGP."
2,"ok, not great or even good",Not a good movie for the enthusiast. Senna's movie would be 5 stars this movie was somewhat watchable. No inside stories. No insights into technique for the club racer.
1,Couldn't watch the dvd; wrong region,I am living i Europe as per the address. I didn't know the dvd was only for american dvd players so I can't watch it.It was certinaly not made clear when I was buying it.I will sell it if anyone wants to buy it.
4,Great Documentary,This is what motorcycle racing is all about. Probably the best documentary I've seen on the sport.The first DVD focuses on the 01-02 seasons while the second focuses on the 03 season.Get up close and personal with your favorite riders. I highly recommend this for any motorcycle racing fans.
4,faster,"I felt the video was pretty informative,I would like to have seen interview's with more riders,mechanics,family and earlierracing fotage of the riders"
4,Very good,Good race footage as well as some background on info on some of today's best racers. I Highly recommend it
3,Kid Vengence,I was needing another Lee Van Cleef movie I had not seen yet. Was able to get this one and got fine service. One of Van Cleef's lesser quality films but he always saves the movie with his performance. The only reason to see this movie is Lee Van Cleef.
2,hurt my feet 1st day,"These seemed to be comfy at first, but after an hour I had 3 bad blisters. i wouldnt reccomend this specific model of their sandals at all! they do look nice, but thats it"
4,good book ; bad translation,"this is a classic book. however, the new 8th edition is not translated very well. i have an older english version (6th edition, 1968) that is translated much better. even where the content is the same between the two editions, the ""updated"" translation is worse that in the original version."
5,Unsurpassed,"Although I have only the first edition, I still find it to be of immense value, and hands-down superior to any other book on the subject (save the newer edition perhaps). It seamlessly weaves together theory, mathematics, and experimental observation, into a very readable and (surprisingly) interesting text. Because it explains the fundamentals so well, Schlichting's book is one of those rare engineering classics that will continue to be of value for a very long time to come."
5,Great oversized folders,"Great folders for those bulging files that can't fit into a regular folder. One set of these helped clean up two drawers. They don't work well for small files as the papers curl, but for the full files they are ideal."
4,Serves the purpose,"This product isn't as sturdy as a ""box"" style. This one is held open by an insert laid in the bottom. The ""box"" style has accordion sides, which would do a better job of holding things in and would add some structural stability. But...the box style is more expensive."
2,this item is mis listed in a deceptive manner,"the purchase area clearly states EDITION-HARDCOVER. but if you scroll down to the way way bottom it says"" cd rom"" ... what is it they send you ? it SURE IS NOT A HARDCOVER !!! UNLESS You count the case of the stupid cd rom as a ""hard-cover"" . . what is it!@!?! I WANT MY MONEY BACK AND THEY HAVE NOT REPLIED IN A MANNER THAT FITS THIS LISTING ERROR YET!!!!!"
4,The HECK with this!,"All in the Family was around $90.00 on amazon and that was more like it. so there is no way I'm going to pay $139.00 for it when it was only $90, that's just bull. For now I will just forget about getting this and I will just keep on watching the All in the Family series on YouTube for free."
4,little girls are terrifying,"This movie was not what I expected. The movie started off somewhat okay and then the suspense kept building. While some of the movie was predictable, there were some scenes that made you think. I would suggest this movie to any person who enjoys scary movies, social workers or anyone who let's weird little girls in their house."
2,I agree with cory,"Talented Cast, Decent Story, but Falls a Bit Short. This movie could have been great but for some reason it was not and I don't quite know why. I wanted so bad to love it. There were some good moments in it but after a while I just wanted it to end"
3,Creepy,Well I had trouble sleeping the first night after watching this movie if that tells you anything.LOL Too bad Bradly Cooper got killed off so fast.
3,Not Bad!!!,"This movie was a little different than I expected. Renée Zellweger stars as a social worker named Emily Jenkins. She is given a 39th case of child abuse. The parents of Lillith Sullivan are about to burn her, but Emily stops them. Not too long after Lillith moves in with Emily, supernatural things begin to happen. I'd probably recommend CASE 39!!!"
3,SCCCAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRY!,"I thought this was in the psychological thriller genre, not the horror. That said, home alone on a cold, snowy winter night makes for scary stuff, I actually had to turn it off and come back in the light of day in the morning. I liked the movie and thought the acting was great especially the little girl."
2,The story is given away up front...the rest is filler,"This movie starts out well, with engaging characters and enough intrigue to pique my interest. So I was really suprised when the whole story was laid bare within the first half hour -- I kept expecting some sort of twist to take things to a different level. Instead, some rather nonsensical plotting occurs in order to stretch things out. Even the characters are just filler, with no believable motivation behind their actions; they're just doing what needs to be done, saying what needs to be said, to get the story from point A to point B. I could've watched the first half hour, then skipped ahead to the last ten minutes, and been just as satisfied as if I'd watched the whole thing (and I wasn't very satisfied). If you're interested in what this movie might have to offer and haven't seen The Omen or The Ring, I suggest watching one of those films instead. Still, Case 39 is a pretty creepy movie."
3,What was wrong with Renee's face...?,"I spent half the movie trying to figure out what was going on with poor Renée Zellweger's face. I'm not trying to be mean but something seemed to happen to her health during filming. In one scene she would be puffy and blotchy, like she just ate three cartons of cream cheese donuts and a greasy pizza, but a few minutes later in the movie she would look like herself again. I found this very distracting. Renée is great, but something was not right with her and it affected the movie for me. Other than that I found the flick to be a fun, creepy (although sometimes a bit disturbing) 'B' popcorn movie. If you watch it, check out the alternate ending. I actually liked it better. Oh yeah and... ""Don't yell at ME!!!"""
2,disappointing,Was RZ directed to act frightened of the girl? A shame. It would have been much better if she had worked through her fear and continued to love her.
2,scary but stupid,Other reviews have commented on the unoriginality of this movie and I whole heartedly agree. This movie fails in so many departments one has to suspend more than the usual amount of belief in order to enjoy it. And I use the term enjoy loosely because there are many disturbing scenes in this movie involving young children that I contemplated turning it off. That being said the movie was pretty damn scary even though I knew how ridiculous it was. There was just to many cliches for me in this one but if you want to be scared you could do worse.
2,Schlock,"A bad version of The Omen. Only it's a girl that's the evil one. Renee Z again emotes anal retentiveness. You know this plot already -- don't bother. Two stars for one truly scary scene (helps to watch it in the dark, by yourself ... )"
3,Suspenseful,"Case 39 proved to be a cool movie. I like the child actress and the main actress. The storyline was not bad at all. One of the few movies that I could watch. If you like this movie you might also like Chloe, The Orphan, and Unfaithful."
3,An OK movie,"Case 39This movie is not worth buying for your collection. The preview makes it sounds great, but it's not, rent it or wait until it comes on cable TV to watch it."
1,Don't bother,"Unbelievably unbeliveable. I thought this was a terribly movie. Why didn't the guy leave the bathroom when he was being attacked by the hornets he hated? Drove me nuts that the guy didn't just run out of the house when it was happening. As far as I got, the movie was mostly terribly negative and who needs that -- not me. Didn't finish watching this downer."
5,great movie,wow this 1 was one of the few i can fully say i loved more than the saw movies and also close to 2012
4,Good horror/thriller flick,"Considering what the typical social worker is like, Renee's character made the switch from skeptic to believer pretty fast; and, it is an unusual choice altogether to have a social worker at all, considering they don't believe. But, the story covers that in the early part with Renee questioning the liberal doctrination of her field, so that sets us up for a more believable conversion, which then sets us up for her taking matters into her own hands in dealing with Rosemary's baby.The kid actor in this film did a great job making us believe that no prescription medicine in the world will settle her problem. And she does creepy like the clown in IT does creepy, but all without pointy teeth or makeup.This movie has some bits of gore, but nothing extreme and no jump out at you scenes, but still it has a strong creep factor that will keep you thrilled. Well worth watching."
3,"A Little Fast, But Still Creepy!","So we start off with a case working with Child Protective Services who rescues a little girl from a supposedly abusive home.She then takes this little girl into her own home because she wants her to be in a stable environment. Only to find out that the little girl is supposedly the devil incarnate and she has to finish the work the her original parents started. She has to kill this little girl before the girl kills her!I loved how creepy this little girl was and how it was a psychological thriller and really messed with my head. The only thing I didn't like was how quickly the girl went from being all sweet and loving to a demon spawn from hell! There was almost no build up, she was just instantly creepy and psychotic. Then the original father says ""You've only had her for 2 months!"" But it didn't seem like two months. It seemed more like just a few days. Oh well.If you love creepy thrillers with scary little kids, check it out!"
2,Like a soda with no bubbles...,"This is a movie that starts out far better than it ends. It had my attention for the first half of the movie. It does a decent job of setting up the plot, but then it seems to all become exposed in a way that left me thinking, this is missing some real pop. I get that the little girl has a demon in her but it's really just a random demon that has no tie to the star or anyone else for that matter. To me, it would have made more sense to tie the demon and Zellweger's mom or past together in a bit more of a personal twist. It does none of this. So 2 stars from me and I love Zellweger. Just too bad the demon has ""zero"" personality."
4,Very much like a 'Stephen King' story,"Case 39 is a fun psychological horror movie with MINIMAL special effects and solidly 'based in reality.' There are only a few scenes where you get a glimpse of the evil living within the young girl. I really like that because it forces the writers to tell a good story rather than relying on special effects. For me, walls melting, books flying, people levitating, etc, etc . . . isn't particularly scary.There is also minimal blood; a number of people are brutally killed, but the gore is kept to a comfortable and reasonable level. The blood serves a purpose and tells the story, its not just gore for the sake of gore (Saw II-IX, I'm looking at you)When it was finished, the story felt like a Steven King formula: 95% of the people are perfectly normal and grounded in reality, but one character is haunted / possessed / evil and everybody reacts accordingly. I thoroughly enjoyed this flick: it's not the best thing I've ever seen, but still very enjoyable."
3,"Renee, You Should Have Stuck To Your Other 38 Cases!","This was recommended to me by a horror afficienado but since I'm not a real big fan of the genre I didn't pay him much mind. My interest was piqued when this film was recommended to me, albeit with spoilers, by a co-worker. Personally, I have mixed emotions about the film. For the most part it's predictable and bogged down with horror movie cliche. That said, cliched as the movie is, it kept me riveted for the most part. It doesn't break new ground but you could do a whole lot worse. I tread carefully with films like this because you don't want to give away too much. I'll conclude by saying if you're a horror buff you'll probably like the film and if you are a marginal fan you may like it."
4,Old school psychological thriller,"This reminds me of the psychological thrillers that were made when I was a child. Good cast, well played and suspenseful. Good movie. Would recommend."
2,Eh. Can't give it 3 stars...,"The best rating I can conjure for this film is 2 stars. And that's because of Renee Zellweger. The failings of this movie are not her fault. Well, other than the fact that she agreed to do the film! Her acting was believable. She walked the talk. She was living what was happening. She just was wasting her efforts though. She alone couldn't save it. If you can pass up this one, you should."
3,Decent.,"Good movie to ignore while you're doing other things. Not scary, but relatively entertaining for 10-15 minutes at a time."
3,Slow and predictable,You've seen this movie before in different forms. Not much surprises as you already know who the bad person is right at the beginning. I fast forwarded every few minutes and skipped to the end cause I was bored.
2,Really Boring,"I really wasn't impressed with the story all that much. It was interesting when the kid told the therapist guy what she thought of him, but otherwise it was boring, boring boring. It didn't scare me at all."
3,haha,Fun horror movie I guess. Not much of a Shyamalan twist to it though. Would have been better with Dolph Lundgren.
3,Good/Bad girl.,"Case 39 starring Renee Zellweger is a good thriller but has some flaws as well. Zellweger seems like an odd casting choice but I have always enjoyed her in other films, don't get me wrong...she is great in this but I think she needs to stick the rom-com genre. Bradley Cooper just seems out his element as a child psychologist. Case 39 has some spooky and interesting moments and Jodelle Ferland is an exceptional little actress, but this film just left me slightly disappointed."
3,ending wasnt good.,"Good movie.. until the very end. Throughout the movie the little girl was pretty creepy.. The ending was just..... not believable. She's supposedly a ""demon""... at the end.. looked more like a monster than satan. cheesy."
3,New version of the Omen.,"This is very simular to the Omen, but with Renee Zellweger. It was a weird story and I thought the little girl was good, not a demon. You will be shocked to find out that the little girl on this isn't so innocent as we have thought."
3,Creepy but average,"The movie starts out well, a social worker, a counselor & a police officer working together to help a child. The plot quickly turns disturbing. There's always something about evil children that just creeps you out. The performance by the actress who plays the child in this movie was wonderful. She can go from frightened, to sweet to just plain mean and they are all believable. The majority of the movie was interesting, creepy but then towards the end it quickly became predictable and it was all downhill from there. The ending definitely left me disappointed."
2,Kept waiting for a surprise twist that never came,"While I was watching this, I kept waiting for some surprise twist, but one never came. I predicted early on about the girl, but thought there might be a twist concerning the flashbacks of the mom. There wasn't. The flashback is pretty straightforward.There was no real suspense either. For instance, the scene where this person is attacked by bees wasn't the slightest bit scary and seemed weird how that scene ended.I thought the story sped too quickly in some parts, too. For instance, Renee's character didn't show any signs of believing in the occult, yet overnight she becomes paranoid. That needed a better development.I give this 2 stars because I thought the young girl gave a good performance, though she came across as more bratty than menacing. Clearly this movie wanted to be the next Omen, but didn't offer anything surprising to make it stand out."
5,Great movie-Worth watching!!!!!!,This was definitely one of the best movies I've seen in a while. I love scary movies and this was definitely suspensful. I really liked how it was interesting and kept me on edge the entire movie. Even 20 minutes into the movie there was drama and excitement. I also thought that the social worker plot was a unique way of making an otherwise over-done storyline of possession fresh and new. The little girl in the movie was a great little actress!!
4,Good movie,I was expecting to not like this movie since most horror movies these days are crap but it ended up being a good horror movie for once!Very suspenseful and creepy.I jumped a couple of times.I recommend adding this movie to your horror collection.
4,Strange case,"Order this movie on advise from a friend.From this very first opening shots to the last, found thismovie to be full of actin , and thrills ,so hold onto the remoteand enjoy the ride. This is a very EVIL Little Girl."
5,Watch Out for who you adopt,This is a pretty good movie. The actors were great espicially Jodelle Ferland. She was pretty creepy. She played a well part. all in all this movie was pretty good
2,Don't bother-you've seen it before,"Despite an excellent cast, Case 39 has such a very old premise-the evil child scenario-that even great acting cannot redeem it. The story is almost completely predictable and rapidly becomes tiresome. If you want a suspenseful story, watch ""Winter's Bone"", instead."
4,3.5 Star Decent Suspense/Horror Movie,"****SPOILER FREE REVIEW****I love how the movie starts off normal then slowly takes us into the realm of Horror. This type of genre ""good child whom is really evil"" is starting to be a bit over done and well traversed. Be that as it may, this movie was decent. Acting is superb, Rene of course can really do no wrong.The child actress is phenonmenal as well (where do they find these kids?)The introduction of the supernatural feels organic, I was fine with more or less everything.When I think of this movie, I think of a diet version of ""The Ring"".Not too bad. I'd give it 3.5 stars but Amazon doesn't do the 1/2 star thing so I gave it 4 stars."
3,Not bad.,"I found it contained too many of the standard ""evil child"" tropes that other movies of its ilk have (The Omen, for example), but the casting made up for it - excellent acting all 'round."
3,"Just OK, not great. Time filler.","This movie is good to watch once, in order to waste a little time if you have some that needs killing. (A little pun intended.) Not the best horror film, not the worst. For the awesome price of Freee on Prime, I can't complain for entertaining me (partially) for a good hour and a half."
5,"Great movie, great price","I love buying used movies at Amazon.... Case 39 is a good one you must see....Rene Zellweger is amazing, because is a little weird to see a comediant in an horror movie.... The child actress is really scary."
2,Shit scary girl,I'm surprised it was made in 2010. Cliche. Very typical. But the girl actor was incredible. She was shit scary. Don't watch this for a casual dinner date.
3,Worth Watching!,I thought for what it was this was a decent film. Acting was not great by Renee but the little Girl was good. Overall a creepy film especially the first 20 Min. or so.
1,Frustrating,"There is about seven minutes of music, the rest is devoted to the lives and doings of ten music ladies and their families. I spent over one hour waiting for a concert that never happened."
3,Cuban string orchestra,An interesting DVD about an orchestra. I was a little disappointed that this DVD is a bit in the past now. I heard the orchestra on Cubavista satellite TV in 2011 when they were stunning and there were more orchestra members. I should have preferred more orchestral playing and less biographies.
4,Great stocking stuffer for real or armchair outdoorsmen,"You don't have to be a travel and outdoors enthusiast to enjoy this book; consisting of Truth McNuggets ranging in length from a few pages to a few tens of pages, it's as appropriate in the bathroom or next to the bedlamp as in a hard-used backpack or on the shotgun side of the car. You'll laugh, you'll cry, and now and then you'll probably wonder why on earth anybody would want to do such a thing -- but you'll be glad that he did and wrote about it."
2,Overrated Dribble,"I bought this book because of an Amazon.com recommendation which said if I enjoyed Bill Bryson's I would enjoy Cahill. Unfortunately Cahill has neither the sense of humour nor the keen sense of observation which makes Bryson one of the most entertaining authors of the moment. Cahill writes like a reporter for a backwater newspaper who has nothing to say, but has to fill some space. Boring."
5,something for everyone,"Cahill may not be a world-class mountaineer or climber - he's simply someone out there doing things, having fun, and writing hilarious accounts of his adventures and antics!From caving and climbing to paddling and interesting encounters with bears - Cahill had me in stitches throughout most of the book!A ""definitely must read"" for anyone vaguely interested in the outdoors!"
4,This is a very good product.,"I tried these out because they are supposed to reduce the speed of fret wear. The problem for me, is that I find it's hard to slide on the lower strings. For some strange reason, they seem to offer more resistance than their roundwound counterparts. They're worth checking out and might be the right product for you even if they weren't for me."
3,"Trebles are great, basses aren't for me.","I've used D'Addario Light Top/Heavy Bottoms for a long time. The EXL-140 are great but with every day extended play as on tour I would change them once a week. The EXP-140 are amazing and can last for 3 months without even breaking a string. That's using a Pick Boy Carbon Edge 1.14 pick and playing an average of 3 hours a day, rehearsing 4 days a week. The tone is bright and resonant with ample sustain and I feel these are the best for the money. I think the EHR-340 have the same trebles, but the basses are half round. They have less resonance and brightness. Reminds me of an old Fender Telecaster bass with flat wounds - thump and decay country sound. The plus side is less wear on your frets and fingers and a more subdued bass sustain, but it's not for me."
5,Fabulous Compromise & my strings for life.,"I decided to try flat wound strings on my hollowbody jazz-box style guitar to lose the string squeak but the dullness and lack of sustain was really noticeable. So I tried these half rounds, which are now my favorite strings on all my electrics. Nice and bright with absolutely no squeak and easy on the fingers. The bonus is the much lower price."
3,They came back in about 2 wks,"We live on 15 acers and have a huge gopher problem. This product worked well but the gophers came right back, then I found out you could put 2 sticks of spearment gum in the hole cover with a board and they eat it and die and have not come back. I did that in June this is Oct. still no gophers!! Hurry!!!"
1,Save your money,"Each time I buy this (because it is what the landlord gets us to use) the damn gophers just dig more holes. We had one hole used this the next morning we had 5 holes, got some more put it in the 5 new holes, only to wake up to a yard with more holes/mounds. This seems to attract the gophers more than kill them. So disappointed our yard looks terrible."
1,Well......,"Well, I bought two of these and used as directed, and the moles just continued to destroy my yard. Save your $10 after shipping and get rid of your yard's grubworms."
4,Great for kindergarten,I use this a lot with my sons homework. We build his sight words and sound out words. They work great. I would have given 5 stars but some of the letters are not centered on the tile and sitting low. That is my only complaint but they still work for us.
3,Nothing special,"For the price the students wont know the difference. These are nice seem sturdy, yet the letters look different on every tile. Oh well they will work."
5,Mise Eire/Saoirse? Review,"Wonderful video. Incredible archival footage which is an amazing historical document of great interest and education to anyone interested in Irish history or colonial oppression by the reigning empire and the resulting starvation and death. The extent of the devastation in Dublin after the failed 1916 Uprising is an extraordinary revelation. Large parts of Dublin were destroyed by fire caused by shelling from the gunboat Helga, moored in the Liffey. The children have a haunted look, which reminds me of the footage of orphan children in Iraq, a precursor of starvation and death. I’d like to know more about Maud Gonne and Constance Markievicz. It’s obvious what a dynamic and brilliant orator Michael Collins was from the footage. The music by Sean O’ Riada is haunting and beautiful; the theme is Padraig Pearse’s Roisin Dubh, Little Black Rose."
5,a must read,"'If you really loved me' imo is one of ann rules best books.. I found David Brown to be one of the most despicable humans on planet earth.. How a father could stoop so low as to manipulate his 15yr old daughter into killing her step mother is beyond me.. even worse he tried to get her to kill herself .. had the pills he gave her not caused her to vomit, she just may have died.. the way he manipulated the women or girls in his life was sickening.. Unlike so many murderers there didn't seem to be any trauma in his growing up years,, why he did these awful things.. seemed to be strictly for control purposes and money.. I have a particalar hatred for people who talk others into murderering for them.. I also have read all of her books.. and am anxiously awaiting a new one.."
4,Now Here Is a Dysfunctional Family!,"A short review to any A.R. novel is preferred, the better not to divulge the plot on the Net!""If You Really Loved Me"" is good writing, with an ""inverted story"". A murder is committed in the early pages and ""whodunit"" quickly identified. But there is so much more here! Ms. Rule takes close to 600 pages to lay bare the full, bizarre tale of a mean, selfish, compulsive and manipulative father named David Brown. If there is a fault to the book, it lies in the almost total dearth of likable or even sympathetic characters. What a crew! A hint: Skip over the centerfold of pictures in this and other A.R. works. The photos may (or may not!) give away the outcomes. A final hint: Don't spend too much time reading reviews. If you like the genre, ""If You Really Loved Me"" is a safe choice!"
4,Great Read,After reading Heart Full of Lies... this was a refreshing novel to read. I thought it was written great and gave great detail through interviews. A great story to keep you reading more and more.
4,book purchase,FOR THE PRICE THE BOOK WAS WHAT I EXPECTED. WAS RECEIVED IN A TIMELY MANNER. NO PROBLEMS AT ALL
1,frustrating toy!,"I have played with this type of toy before and enjoyed all the building possibilities, exactly why I wanted to share that open-ended play with my children. Unfortunately, this toy provides nothing but frustration because the pieces literally pop apart as you are building with them, almost as if they are spring loaded. Like building a house of cards, we get a tower built only to have it completely collapse as we put the last piece on. We have had small successes, but not worth the time or money. A great idea for a toy, but this is a very poor quality version."
3,"Fun Toy, but...","I bought this toy for my 7 year old girl for Christmas. I spent about 1 1/2 hours setting it up on Christmas eve (longer than I expected) and had to rebuild several sections as this toy tends to fall over easily during setup.However, once I completed the setup, my daughter enjoyed playing with it for hours afterward. The next day she decided to take the toy apart and build a new one. She became frustrated from time to time with the toy falling over and asked for my help several times. She still enjoyed playing with it once the setup was complete.I think this is a fun toy, but be aware that it takes some practice and usually several attempts to get a complete setup."
4,Marble Express,My boys love this toy. They spend hours building different levels for the marble to drop. I have given this toy as a birthday present and the boy said it was his most awesome toy ever! One problem--you have to use it on a solid floor or it will fall apart. Trial and error taught us quickly!
1,NOT GOOD!!!!,"Very hard to build anything.pieces dont interlock,so therefore you start to build a tower and it will fall apart before you can finish dont recomendthis product for anyone.Very expensive and not worth it.My son got it for christmas he is 9 and loves to build things.He worked on this once became frustrated and hasnt touched it since.Ive played with it with my son,and I became frustrated as well."
2,Nightmare,"This product looks great on the box and would appear to provide hours of entertainment for the kids, however, there are no instructions at all on how to build anything. You have to go by the picture on the box. It takes hours to tell which piece is what (as color does not necessarily mean anything to one particular shape or size) and the pieces have no way of locking in. After spending over an hour on this (and the kids still not seeing one marble move an inch) we needed to move it out of the way so we could leave and the whole thing fell over. It's been sitting back in the box ever since. I recommend this product for older kids with patience and determining."
3,BEWARE! Songs are NOT Listed Correctly,"Beware! The album listings are incorrect! Example, Listing #3 ""Don't worry about me"" is REALLY ""Midnight Sun!"" also found on The Lost treasures Of Ted Heath Vol. 1 -2. So if you do not want duplication of the same songs I recommend that you skip this album!"
5,Excellent Box Set,"Severin has done a fantastic job releasing Vol. 1 and 2 of the Black Emanuelle series. These 3 films are sexy, artistic, and quite interesting. The video quality varies but is generally speaking, very strong. These aren't stunning DVDs but they're solid transfers. The audio isn't as good as the video but sounds clear and decent enough. The whole thing is packaged in a gorgeous cardboard case that can be opened up to reveal a topless Laura Gemser. There are a few extras that are interesting and a CD from various Emanuelle soundtracks. Highly Recommended to lovers of erotic/artistic flicks!"
3,Good for Emanuelle Collection,One of the CD was an audio CD but overall what I expected. Video quality is the same for that time period it is not enhanced.
