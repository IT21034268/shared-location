2,Not worth it,Pretty disappointing. I had hoped for something I could use in the classroom but it was not well done. It is so easy now to do interesting graphic design for reproducible pages and this was just schlock. If you are a new teacher and would like somewhere to begin with pi activities you might find this useful.
2,Hardly A Guide,"The author has an easy readable, style that found me reading the book in one evening. It is laced with humorous anecdotes, but that is where the ""goodness"" stops.The information on saw and tree safety is a gloss over at best and very disturbing considering the immense danger involved in proper cutting, nevermind improper. A chainsaw manual from a reputable dealer has more safety and technique information than this book. Novices beware, this book will not teach you how to be a ""good"" woodcutter.The pages on selecting clothing at the Salvation Army and driving around in a beater of a truck would have been better used discussing wood cutting, but it obvious that his self-taught methods and his ""it's not the right way, but the way I do it"" attitude will get some unlucky beginner killed. Don't buy this book if you are looking for info on Chainsaw milling, he knows nothing about it.A better title might have been ""Subsistence Living with Pulp and Cordwood."""
3,The Good Woodcutters Guide,"Dave Johnson is a practical guy, who writes a practical guide. He provides a very good review of chainsaw use, safety, and maintenance. He also does a pretty good job of discussing bucking, felling, and all other aspects of getting pine trees off your lot for money.The other areas discussed, such as sawmills, and economics were interesting, but only cursory. If you are already proficient with a chainsaw, but want to know more about woodlot management, this is not your book.My only two minor criticisms of the book are Johnson should use diagrams more when he is describing the techniques of felling, bucking etc. Also, It was evident that the author was biased to recommend products sold by his publisher. In particular, his acclaim of a sawmill that the publisher sells, even though he admits that he never used one.If you are looking for a good book on using your chainsaw to get wood on the ground, this is the book for you."
3,The Good _Logger's_ Guide,"The title is misleading. While they mention sawmills in the title, there is precious little information on milling, 11 out of 212 pages. If you are looking for info on wood and drying it, try Hoadley's ""Understanding Wood"", and ""Fine Woodworking On: Wood and How to Dry it""."
4,Very informative guide to small woodlot manangement,"I liked this book - It was not exactly what I had in mind but close enought that I could use it as a valuable resource. i ama from a part of the country where deciduos forests reign supreme and this book is more conifer related with some mentions of scrub oals btu i still enjoyed the read. the information about slective harvesting, chains aw use and maintenance and picking a certain brand of saw were al ver helpful"
1,Terrible,These are the most uncomfortable shoes I've ever had on my feet. The straps dig into your feet like you wouldn't believe.
1,shoe broke after wearing once,my shoe literally broke in half after wearing them once - not happy at all.
2,VRJ,I didn't find this book very helpful in getting information on digital photos. The book trys to hard to be funny and not prctitcal.
5,"A Modern, American Elvis Costello","I first saw Jim Bianco on the same bill as Glenn Tilbrook, former lead singer/guitarist for Squeeze, at the Beachland Ballroom in Cleveland. I had never heard of him, but I was knocked out. Songwriting is quickly becoming a lost art, but Jim Bianco is keeping it alive. This album features him with a backing band, which adds an extra dimension to his singer-songwriter persona, but it's a welcome dimension. There isn't a weak song on the album, but standouts include Best That You Can Do, Sorry and Tennessee Wedding."
4,"Good sound of ""original"" group","Good quality transfers of original Decca material, but the cover is rather disappointing since it is of a 50's version of the Golden Gate Quartet! It is sad that somebody doesn't know the difference in what these guys looked like. One bright spot is the man at the bottom of the photo- Cliff Givens who replaced Hoppy Jones initially in the original Ink Spots group!"
1,It may be good but...,"I bought this book as a gift for someone who is a long distance grandma and thought it would be useful. I chose it after considering this and others available through Amazon. However, when I received the book I was surprised to discover the author peppers her writings and suggestions with Biblical references throughout the book. This is not something I particularily like and would have preferred for the review to indicate this. I have since returned the book."
2,Long Distance Grandma,Purchased this hoping for some interesting and creative ways to stay in touch with my grandkids across the country. Had no idea it was going to be very religious in outlook. Very disappointed in this book.
3,Nothing new here,This book didn't tell me anything I hadn't already thought of. My grandchildren have just moved away and I'm looking for ways to stay connected to them. Most of these ideas have been presented before. One thing I did like was that she went through the year month by month and gave ideas for the season or holiday going on.
4,A years worth of ideas,"You'll find recipes, crafts and fun ideas for the holidays that you can use to stay close to long distance grandkids. I found the ways to make blended families feel loved especially helpful in this day and age of so many remarriages."
4,John Deere Lift the Flap Book Merriweather Farm,I love the book. It is impossible to find flap books for little boys. This is a good one with not too many words per page. The flaps are fun and the pictures are good. It is one of his favorites.
1,Not what I expected,"I have always been a paul anka fan. I have all of his greatest hits on albums and cherish them deeply, but when I came across this DVD, I expected a great singing performance, not a comic act. What happened with his original style of singing? Many of the songs had different melodic tones mixed with his comments to the audience. For example, when he sang Puppy Love, he was adding lyrics to his song by making a comment about a pregnant woman in the audience, which I found distastful. Overall, I expected an entertaining concert filled with his talent as showed in the past. If you are looking for a great Paul Anka concert, this is definitely not the one. I deeply regret ever buying this DVD. If anyone out there knows where to get a great concert of Paul Anka on DVD please let me know."
5,Brings to life the travails of living under Union occupation,"Historian Gordon Cotton's From The Pen Of A She-Rebel: The Civil War Diary Of Emilie Riley McKinly is the fascinating and informative story of Ms. McKinly, told in her own words, as she and her rural Southern neighbors witnessed the depredations of the Civil War. What made Ms. McKinly unique was that she was a Yankee by background, yet she personally embodied deep sympathy for her Confederate neighbors. Extensively annotated vignettes bring to life the travails of living under Union occupation, and paint a vivid picture of a corner of America that was uprooted and changed forever by the surge of history. An epilogue provides as much historical closure as is available concerning Ms. McKinly and her neighbors after the war. From The Pen Of A She-Rebel is a unique and welcome addition to the growing body of Civil War literature available for readers and students today."
5,Loved This,owned this album in my early yeats...great to have it available on cd...really great music and lyrics...
5,One of best tenors ever!..+ an unlisted song,"This is a must have for any Glenn Yarbrough fan. ( I might say it's my favorite). Besides what has become his theme song for his concerts "" Baby the Rain Must Fall"", there are many songs on this CD which will touch your heart strings & memory.Glenn's voice is clear and strong. I think it's a great collection. If you listen with good headphones you'll be either humming along, tappin' your toe or reminising in your mind. Songs like ""Rusting in the Rain"" will keep you enthralled by his unique voice. ""Everybody's Rich But Us"" ..you'll be a smilin'! He's getting up in years, when he's gone the world will have lost a great one. ENJOY!(**PS..there's actually 12 songs [at least on my copy].. an extra song not listed on cd titled ""Walk On Little Boy"" is right before ""Billy Goat Hill"" which is actually #12 ..I guess Record Co. must have missed listing it?)also seeThe Tradition Years: Come Sit by My SideLive at the Troubadour"
5,My Absolute Favorite Canned Soup,"I LOVE tortilla soup, and I have tried all of them..Healthy Choice, Wolfgang Puck Natural, Wolfgang Puck Organic, the Campbell's Select one, and any other kinds they care at my local grocery store. Wolfgang Puck's natural tortilla soup tastes homemade and has more flavor than the others, which both look and taste sort of watery. Now I can't buy any other brand, and if they're out of this I simply don't buy any soup. I just ordered a case of this, and I hope you try it and love it too!"
1,Never Delivered,Product not available for shipping. Nice idea but I have no idea if it would have been a good purchase.
4,Pretty Good Adventure Game,"I'm a big fan of adventure games, and I honestly enjoyed this one. You're getting plenty of gameplay (over 10 hours), so it's worth the money. A lot of puzzles, ranging from very easy, to one virtually impossible. Plenty of different types of puzzles as well - all well integrated into the story line. Nice graphics, decent sound, and a relatively engaging story. The only downside is the fact that there is no fast way of getting from one spot to another. Still - I'd recommend this to any adventure gamer."
2,Not worth the money.,"For this day and age, this game has extremely cheesey graphics and voiceovers. I can't believe how goofy the voiceovers sound. They sure didn't spend a lot on the actors.Gameplay is fairly easy, which is a plus, but if you aren't enjoying what you see, who cares?"
4,This company has serious adventure potential,"In one of the best tributes to old-school fantasy adventure games in many years, Wicked studios has made a labour of love in the articulate rendering of their gigantic magical school. The constraints of the budget do end up getting in the way, but I hope that enough heads were turned to get Wicked studios the attention and future finances that they, and adventure games, deserve.."
5,A wonderful game!,"I play adventure games on a regular basis and I really enjoyed this game for the following reasons:1) The storyline is well put together and made sense2) The scenery can be quite breathtaking3) The puzzles range from quite easy to extremely difficult, but there is always the chance to get hints or (if you spent way too much time on the puzzle and its time to move on) you can get the solution4) The main character interacted with others on a regular basis. I'm so tired of never encountering another person in adventure games!5) I initially thought the characters were going to be quite shallow and predictable, but things change!Great job on this one!! It's certainly one of my all-time favorites!"
2,"if you like to waste time running back and forth, this is for you","This is the most tiresome game, it's taken me a year to finish it, only because I get so tired of all the running back and forth. there is no easy way to go from place to place, you have to remember exactly where things are. a lot of this is running from one end to another, back and forth, collecting things or answering puzzles. It would be a half way decent game if they created a map that you could click on to take you from here to there. I swear I spent 3/4 of my time on this game trying to remember where a certain rooms is, and running there. Very badly setup."
4,Keepsake is a keeper,"I was impressed with the graphics,landscape and music of this game. The story line was full of interesting characters. I completed the first level and was blown away when I entered the second level to see a whole new set of puzzles - even more challenging than the first level. (I suggest the makers consider reducing the amount). The flow of the game was somewhat confusing and I found myself accessing the help function a great deal. The first time I played, the game hung and produced code errors. Evidently this is a known problem because I found a patch on the Keepsake website. DOWNLOAD AND RUN THIS PATCH AFTER INSTALLING THE GAME. It will save having to start your game over."
2,"The good and the bad, mostly bad.","It's got some occasionally interesting puzzles, but the lame story and irritating characters kill whatever appeal Keepsake might have had.The Good: Unique and challenging puzzles; handy hint system helps keep the game moving.The Bad: Some of the worst voice acting you will ever hear; blurry, low-res backgrounds; dull characters and an uninteresting story."
1,More trouble than it's worth,"Nice graphics and sound, interesting story, not too hard puzzles, but I had some trouble with the game locking up in a certain spot. I downloaded the recommended patch and got further in the game, only to have it lock up again in another spot. The problems spoil the fun in playing. I have no such troubles with any other games I've played. I purchased this game in a bargain bin for less than advertised here and still don't feel it was worth it. Registered with the game makers website and discovered many other players suffering the same problems. Good luck if you still want it."
1,Keepsake was disappointing,"I had great hopes when I began this game. It was advertised as an adventure game with puzzles to solve. Not only were the puzzles so obscure, but it was impossible to determine a sequence of events with which to proceed. I found myself going to the internet for hint after hint. Another detriment to the game was the endless transporting from one area to another. To solve a puzzle, you would have to go through three or four transports only to be forced to go to another area involving a lot of movement. Truthfully, I got to the point where I only wanted to game to end.I have to say this was a totally unsatisfying game experience and would not recommend it to anyone."
2,Decent game but buggy,"I liked the storyline behind this game, the puzzles, the amazing artwork, the characters, and all the things the other reviewers have discussed. But the game was seriously buggy, and it got worse as the game progressed. Downloading the patch made things better, but even then, the game would completely lock up my computer about every half hour. I'm not sure I'll ever have the patience to finish it."
2,Keepsake,"My wife bought this for me on a whim and while I like the game there are a few things I have to swallow to play it.The Artwork in this adventure is nothing short of breath taking. The dragons look amazing in the statues and other places. the Vistas are grand and so is the soundtrack.Yet the main character is misproportioned. I can't stand watching her run! Her arms are way too short. And she's not the only one. With backgrounds so wonderful, why are all the characters so wooden? They don't move smoothly and look like they are gliding across the floor instead of running. The wolf, your companion, looks more like he is covered in skin than hair.And the voice acting is terrible. I can't say much more about that.Yet even with those flaws I am looking forward to finishing this adventure. It looks like a good story.So where did everyone go? :)"
4,Good shoe for the price,"I needed this ASAP for a trip to Mexico. I totally forgot about buying water shoes. We went on a jungle maya excursion. Wasn't super comfortable walking around/climbing up ladder (but I also didn't know that we were gonna be doing that when I bought them). Lasted all day though, compared to other water shoes I have bought in the past. Will be buying these again and recommending to others."
3,Speedo Women's Water Shoe,"As an avid aquafit enthusiast, I was looking forward to trying these new shoes instead of the more ""typical"" aqua shoes held on with velcro. The shoes arrived right on time and so far so good, have held their shape and elasticity. I did have to pull out the inner sole, but that's typical I think for water shoes. I would recommend these shoes and the supplier."
4,Water Shoes,"I bought these to use for water aerobics. They are not supportive enough for impact on the pool floor for me. These water shoes would be great for time at the pool, lake or ocean."
5,nice swim shoe,"this shoe came well packaged and is true to size, i usually go a half sizesmaller than my shoe and it is a good fit."
1,Not water worthy!,"I was diappointed with this purchase. The inside sole of these shoes move all about and do not stay in place, so I have had to remove them. Instead, I have my own insoles for support, another thing this shoe did not have. I do hope the exterior of this shoe holds up. I expected so much more from a speedo product.Don't waster your money or time on this product."
3,Durability issues,"While they are comfortable and were fine the first few times I wore them for water aerobics, now the insoles move around when I'm wearing the shoes and the cloth cover is peeling off one of the insoles. I'm going to try gluing the cloth to the insole & the insoles to the shoes but I shouldn't have to do that. I've had them only a month and use them twice a week so they should have held up better than this."
4,"Great Product, Great price","I bought this product prior to our vacation in Hawaii. For the price, this water shoe is great. It provided very good traction even when doing some easy hiking. It protected my feet when swimming in waters where there were a lot of exposed rocks. You definitely have to follow the shoe size guideline. One recommendation I have is to remove the shoe as soon as you can so you do not leave your feet inside a wet/damp environment. This is how my skin became mascerated and developed redness along the ball of my foot. I certainly do not attribute this to the product itself. I think this would happen with any water shoes I wear. I also bought my husband the same brand of water shoes for men and he wore it most of the time. He did not have any issue with skin masceration or redness on his feet. Overall, I highly recommend this product."
3,On/Off OK but No Grip,"These swim shoes get on and off easily even when wet. What I did not like was that there is no ""grip"" to keep you from slipping on tiles or smooth surfaces on the pool deck. I also needed shoes that would grip so I could work out better when doing water aerobics. If you need this too, then these are not the shoes to buy.If you plan on using them on sandy beaches, then they should be fine."
3,OKAY,"Didn't last as long as the ""Speedo Women's Hydro Comfort Amphibious All Purpose Water"" Shoes do. But they are a comfortable shoe."
5,Surfwalkers were excellent,I bought the Surfwalkers for my wife to use on Cape Cod. She reported back that they were comfortable to wear and did a geat job protecting the bottoms of her feet from sharp objects.
5,speedo surfwalker shoe,"The speedo Womens Surfwalker Pro Water Shoe was one of my best investments. The shoe is comfortable, quality of workmanship is well made. I purchased the color pink and black, just love my shoes. I also get compliments on them too. Thank you amazon for such good quality products."
3,Water shoe,"This is a good product. It dries rapidly after use in my water aerobics classes. My only complaint is that, like many types of footwear, it is too wide for my narrow foot."
3,Speedo Women's Surfwalker,"This shoe is just ok, but not like the old one I had, which had more of a body and secure feeling to it."
4,Lightweight and fit well,We live on the beach in Panama. This is my second pair of these and I've been really happy with them. Just a good standard water shoe.
3,Not so great,"The shoe fits well, but, unfortunately, I had the same experience as some of the other reviewers. The insole comes lose and bunches up around my toes while I am exercising. Even when I put it back in place, it moves again while I am in the water."
4,Dunn's River Falls Test,"I purchased these shoes for a recent cruise trip that included an excursion to Dunn's River Falls. The shoes are very comfortable. I had no problem maintaining a firm grip during our climb up Dunn's River Falls. The only problem I had was some slight slippage of the shoe liner. I additionally wore these shoes to the beach in Grand Cayman and found them to be quiet comfortable and slip free. I would recommend these shoes to anyone looking to do the Dunn's River Falls trip. Note that I have only worn these twice so I cannot comment on how well they hold up over time yet. Essentially, these shoes more than met the task I had purchased them for."
2,Caused blisters on the sides of my feet,These felt comfortable the first time I wore them. After about 20 minutes of walking around in these (we were walking to our cave tubing site) they had rubbed the inside part of my feet raw. I had two huge blisters in the weirdest spots where these were rubbing. :( I don't think I can wear them again.
3,Did not last 1 day,"Fit - runs a bit big. I wear an 8 in flats and 8.5 in boots and sneakers. I bought these in the 8 and they were big. i could've worn the 7's I think.Quality - seemed good at first. I wore them one time (at a zipline park where we walked up a lot of stairs, and zip-lined into the water) and the inner lining came unglued after about an hour! It was very uncomfortable to wear these all day with the bunching up of the liner. As much as I tried to put it back in place, it kept bunching up again.Same thing happened to my fiance (he purchased the men's version).We both threw them out at the end of the day :("
4,Great for pool use!,"I bought these shoes to use in the pool at the YMCA. They are great for me as they give me extra stability in the water and especially on the deck. They fit well and are easy to get on. They also dry quickly, which is a plus for me."
2,Bought for my mom to use for water aerobics,"It constantly blows my mind that manufacturers of thees shoes (especially you Speedo) make a water shoe that does not ultimately hold up to the rigors of cycling wet-dry-wet-dry....!!!! After about 2 months (over a year period) of constant wet-dry use, the inner soles start to lose their adhesiveness! This is unacceptable for a constantly wet water shoe. I have not been able to find a manufacturer that makes a good solid or one piece sole design for this purpose."
3,nice with exception,I bought these water shoes from a retailer for water aerobics. They have good grip and are comfortable but the inner sole of the shoe keeps sliding and crumpling up while I work out.
2,Look great; not well constructed,"I absolutely love how these look (I got the light blue ones), and they fit really well. I'd be delighted with them except that, having only worn them twice, the footpad in one has already come loose and bunches up in odd places under my foot. It's pretty annoying. I spend a lot of time trying to tug the pad back into place, but that only works for a min or so. I'm thinking of trying to reglue it, but I'd have to figure out what type of glue to use.Such a shame because I really like these shoes otherwise."
3,Time will tell,The fit is good but the insoles moved around on the first day in water exercise class. Will try to glue the down but time will tell if I can make these comfortable.
3,Not good for water areobics,"I just bought these have only worn them twice for water areobics and found they were comfortable and worked well for my purpose BUT the second time I wore them (yesterday) something felt funny in the shoe toward the end of my class. When I removed them I found that the insole in the first one had slipped and had scrunched up under my toe area (that was apparently what I was feeling) the second one had slipped so much that half of it was doubled over inside the ""sock"". Hence the average rating. Obviously this is not a good shoe for this purpose if the insole can't even stay in place for 2 wearings. On the plus side the sole is heavier and seems better than the socks most of my classmates are wearing. Not recommended for water exercises."
3,water shoes,overalll okay product. quality of bottom rubber a little weak. only wore twice and bottom slick already. but they served the purpose.
5,Always Good,"This artist knows her stuff, good instruction and colorful book, beautiful finsihed product. Love this book."
5,Great Book,"This is an awesome book. I am a new dollmaker and one day my dolls will look like the ones in the book. For me, it has served as a great tutorial."
1,cookie cutter dolls,"Although most people 'loved' this book, I found it incredibly boring. I hate the faces - with their cow-like eyes and huge lips -the dolls look completely clueless. The directions ar fine and easy to follow, the photos and drawings both are nicely illustrative, but all the dolls basically look very similar, if not the same. I've sewn and made dolls and other stuffed toys for years -including a cat dressed as Lady Katherine Parr [Henry the VIII last wife] and the best part about them was how often construction or intended recipient led to a unique personality. Look at your copies again - do the really depict a special character or are they just an exercise in fiber arts?"
4,Colorful,Unique way of making dolls. Construct doll of Pima cotton (hard to find)Then dye it. The dolls are rather pretty and very colorful.
5,A Dollmaker's Treasure!,"Creative Cloth Doll Making: New Approaches for Using Fibers, Beads, Dyes, and Other Exciting TechniquesAs a accompaniment to my Creative Cloth Doll Faces book, this book is a necessity to help me create beautiful dolls! I am excited and thrilled to have this book and learn about all the wonderful tips and tricks that can be used to create and embellish my dolls and make each doll unique - with her own personality!"
5,Dolls for the Amateurs,If you don't have an Idea of how to begin making dolls this is the book that will take you from the beginning to the end. You want to get creative and make abstract projects this is it. If you already know the process of making dolls this book will only enhance the way to make them. The book has explanations on how to create a tye-dye fabric for dolls and also painted fabric. I think once you get into the process you will enjoy the book as much as I have.
3,Not quite as impressed as I'd hoped,"The other reviews for this book were so glowing that I thought this was the end-all-beat-all of doll-making books. It's not that it's bad. The process is just a lot more complex than I hoped it would be. The dolls are beautiful, but I was hoping for more variety. The first doll--the beginner level doll--requires lots of dying of fabrics. Pima cotton--the basic ingredient of almost all the dolls--cannot be bought anywhere (the large fabric store I usually shop at didn't even know what it was) except online or at the referenced locations in the back of the book. I would have appreciated some alternatives. I'm in the process of making the beginner doll, but am making a lot of alternations to simplify the process. Maybe that's not a bad thing, but sometimes it's nice to have directions for a simple first project, with easily purchased materials, so that you can see if you want to continue."
3,Fits well with my house style.,They look good with my Spanish style theme I have going in my house. My only negative is that they need a liner or some type of shade underneath. They don't filter much of the sunlight from coming through. I put a white liner behind them and they work and look great now.
1,made a mistake,"I bought this kit for my BMW 325i 2002 , and now I have to buy the original BMW because the car is to low and the chassis hit the pavement . Only change the springs if You want to made a upgrade , and the stress bar , never touch the springs ."
1,Terrible Movie,"The product was a good deal and good quality. However, this movie is terrible and I wouldn't recommend waste 2 hours of their life on it."
1,Sadly disappointed,"First, service was great! Quick delivery. Courteous, etc.The product was like a nightmare. The first one sent was like a bootleg copy or something, the movie was all there, just couldn't see it. It was 100% shadow, black, dark, could not see 90% of the scenes. The original is not like this-I have a VHS copy, crisp, clear, bright-I just wanted a DVD of the same movie.The second copy was a little lighter, viewable, so I just gave up, I kept it because I like the movie. But the quality of this copy is not professional and should not be sold to anyone. Whomever did the copy job should be sent to a lonely, dark island somewhere, forever."
4,Kinda bored but still not bad in the end,"Could anybody as a runner been suspended for 20 years? Suspension usually means there is a time limit or period for such penalty or punishment, and it usually means a short term. Yet in this movie the guy after 20 years was still suspended from running. How could it be? That no big deal misconduct is the bad scenario of this movie only served as a tough element for this tough 44 years old middle aged guy to deal with, making the movie itself possible. That misconduct should not and would not sentence him a lifetime ban from running but exaggerated too much. With a lot of totally unnecessary love-making scenes just served as another cheat purpose to keep the viewers not falling sleeping during watching, just another [thing] stuffed into this slow going movie. But all in all, the ending is quite good, showing this guy not only got an iron will, but also a big heart of sharing, for the triumph and satisfaction of such achievement with other front runners."
2,80s [slumm],"Basically this is a typical... 80's movie... the kind you would find late night on USA or something. The characters are tired, simple and boring and the music makes you feel like you are playing Atari. The movie is also incredibly unmotivating, especially if you are a competative, serious runner. Don't buy it, in fact don't rent it."
4,Great road runner movie,"Although not quite in the league with Chariots of Fire, I think this is perhaps the best of the ""running movies"" that followed.Bruce Dern plays ""Wes Holman"", a 44 year old former elite 10K track athlete who was driven from the sport by unfair circumstances. Wes attempts a comeback training for a somewhat unique race, a 14.2 mile mountain trail ""handicap"" race in which runners are started at different times dependent upon their age or sex. It is said that a real race in Marin County, ""The Dipsea"" served as a model for the movie.The movie chronicles the Wes' year of training, while also dealing with issues with his father and the athletic governing body, and has re-kindles a relationship with an old flame, played by Pam Grier. The best part of the movie is simply watching the training and finally the race. Some of the stuff with the race is kind of ""corny"", so to speak, but I think most runners would enjoy the movie just to watch the running."
3,A classic running movie,I would give the film a 5 star usually except the version delivered by Amazon was very edited. In fact all the scenes with Pam Greer were cut out.
1,Unable to play movie,"It would not play. ""Content error"" message. I tried to play it several times on different days. Please refund the cost."
4,Great price Great Quality,"My Wife purchased this item for me for my birthday. I can't wait to actually use it during the season, but from the time I received it until the time I officially broke it in, this glove is the best one I've had. For Baseball/Softball,As some may not no is made by Wilson, who is affiliated with Demarini. Deep pockets, great secure fit around your hand, requires some breaking in, but most good gloves do. Works great with the Wilson Pro stock glove conditioner for softer leather and quicker break in. It is big, so if your not an outfielder you may want to look for another size. This glove is a great buy for the quality and style of the glove, I'm certain it's one of the better gloves out there. Highly recommended."
1,Bad Copy,"I have a bad copy of this DVD and no way to get another one. The store from which it was purchased was going out of business and had no other copies. The first feature plays just fine the second one plays on two of my five dvd players. but the third feature which is the main reason this disc was bought doesn't play on any of them. They will all play all types of DVD's and all CD's audio and video, one is an all region and one has the double layer technology. This DVD disc even says it is compatible with all DVD players worldwide. My cousin has two DVD players that are different from mine they won't play it either.All five of my DVD players are all different name brands.What am I gonna do except buy the movie ""Rock Hard Zombies"" by itself for more than this triple feachure was purchased."
1,APPond Barley Extract for Algae Control,"This product did not work for me. Although this barley straw extract is marketed as an algae control product, to the company's credit nowhere on the label do the words ""controls algae"" appear. After two months of usage according to directions, this liquid had no effect on the algae in my pond.The label does say that the product is ""organically formulated to promote cleaner clearer water.""It didn't do that either."
4,A Wonderful Movie,"I just happened to turn on the TV, and this movie came up. I was intriguied- I LOVE anything to do with Greek Mythology. When the captions appeared, I understood it was in a different language, but that did not detract at all from the movie.The emotion in the movie was thrilling, and the music added greatly to it. Near the end, my heart was thumping, although I already knew what was going to happen.My only issue with this movie is the actor who played Iphigenia. Yes, she is cute, but her hair- In my mind, she looked almost like a boy. I have always pictured Iphigenia with shoulder length blackish-red hair, but that's just me.Overall, a wonderdul movie. I highly recommend it."
4,Highly recommended,"This is more of a recommendation than a review. As a road cyclist, I thoroughly enjoyed both of Moody's books and consider them must reads for those looking for entertainment who have an interest in cycling - real page turners. Sure, they're a bit tongue-in-cheek, bullets flying, comic book-esque and not Pulitzer prize material. But I loved them nonetheless."
2,Not a good purchase,I received my play pen yesterday and attempted to set it up. The pieces do not fit together very well. The floor grate does not attach to the bars well at all. My two puppies were jumping and they collapsed the whole thing and ended up on the floor. The pans also do not fit well. They will not go under the pen until one pops on top of the other one. I now have the whole thing held together with zip ties!
2,Very basic explanation but not a step by step guide.,"This is a very basic primer and guide on horseshoeing but not a step by step guide as one review led me to believe and not helpful as I want to do my own trimming. Don't even care about shoeing but only 10 pages of general info on trimming which I already know from years of owning horses and working with farriers. I would hire a farrier to do shoeing yet. Very few pictures and those are in black & white. I learned a lot more with more pictures from Don Baskins' book, Well Shod by western horseman. This one doesn't but even Baskins' book explains more about the shoeing process. I probably know enough to do a basic trim but i just want to know more about avoiding nipping and cutting to far which neither book really does. Guess I'll try another book for more of a step by step process."
3,It did go through most of the basics...,"But there were not enough rules of thumb. The book did little for me personally to demystify the shoeing practice. No real tips on forging or on technique of any type, which is what I was looking for. Good glossing overview, no insider information."
4,"Excellent, one of his best!","A fantastic, interesting and captivating book. I couldn't put it down! Piers brings in a rival in Nona, making it harder for Colene because she's so nice. He also adds the problem of her parents in, because she finds out they actually care. A superb and well-written book!"
2,Fractured Mode,"Perhaps slightly better than Virtual Mode, but not by much. Again, I recommend this for juveniles and not adults. It seemed to me that the book was really a series of short stories strung together. There is the initial conflict with the despots of Nona's world but Anthony gets away from that quickly but returns to it in the end to wrap things up. Darius is really a minor character in this book which is surprising. The sexual references are getting really old by now. Anthony's description of fractals is hard to follow, and I was a math major! An illustration in a future edition would benefit the reader in showing the layout of the Fractal Mode. On to Chaos Mode which will finish up this series. If there is another book in this series, I plan to steer clear of it."
2,I did not like this book,"I have read some of Anthony's books in the past, and I thought I would like the Mode series, but I was wrong. This book seems more like a math lesson than an adventure story. I liked the plot and the characters somewhat, but it seemed like Mr. Anthony was trying to ram this math concept down my throat. I don't think I'll ever read this book again."
5,"Good, no-fuss book","This book is a mandatory book during my undergraduate Weight Tranining class and it's one of the books that I have kept all these years.The specific and very graphical presentation for each excercise is very easy to follow and because several excercise working on the same muscle group are classified together at the end of the book (all the exercises are numbered and summarized), you could easily choose another exercise that suit you/your equipment better.This is a perfect book for persons who have received some guidance (classes, training) before. If you start weight training from zero, although some programs are also presented inside this book and they can be easily followed, you may need some help from a real person to guide and tailor it for you."
5,I've used this for twelve years- Outstanding,"This excellent book has been around for years and is still one of the greatest resources anyone can use to increase their physical strength or just get in shape. There are really few books out there of this quality that one can really claim are ""for everyone"". This is one of them.Pearl breaks it down for the reader. You can plan your exercises around which sport you want to improve at or which body parts you want to emphasize. Each exercise or series of exercises is also layered according to fitness level. A great resource for anyone.I've used this book for fourteen years and have gone through a couple of them [one criticism is the paper cover- a hardback version would be excellent].An excellent exercise and training resource: Highly recommended."
4,Passing on a great recommendation,I just started getting into fitness and working at a gym. My boss recommended this book and it's been a great help. Lots of exercises to start with and plenty that are sports specific!
5,A must-have in any fitness and strenght-training library.,"Bill Pearl's book is an excellent reference tool for anyone interested in strenght training. Thoroughly comprehensive, it includes sketches of just about any weight-training exercise you could ever need, as well as explanations for each. To round it up, it includes a large variety of sample programs, focused on particular sports, bodybuilding or just general fitness. On the minus side, the nutrition advise is somewhat skimpy; the major drawback been little information on modern diet and supplementation."
1,Not recommended,"Stay way from this one! There are too many antiquated concepts and incorrect exercises. We have come a long way in the science of strength training, and this book has definitely not kept up. The only benefit of this book, is the wide variety of different ways of working a particular muscle group, which will allow you to vary your routine somewhat (a good thing). However, unless you know the difference between correct form and potentially dangerous form, you are better off looking somewhere else."
2,Mediocre writing; beginnings will do better elsewhere,"Compared to several other weight training guides, this one is skimpy on explanatory details, rigid in not providing a choice of exercises within a given category of training, and, like ""Stretching..."", by Bill Anderson, another Shelter publication, far from elegant and efficient in it's design and use of space. It's also produced on cheap paper and too large to easily carry around.IMO, a much better choice is ""Weight Training for Dummies,"" not the less well-written ""Idiot's Guide"" to same, BTW, and, for beautiful and detailed drawings of the anatomical side of all of the exercises you are likely to do, ""Strength Training Anatomy,"" by Frederic Delavier. Also, you could do far worse than pick up ""The Complete Guide to Strength Training,"" by Anita Bean. All three of these guides cover their topic much more coherently than ""Getting Stronger"" does."
1,Too much info,From all the trees you won't be able to see the wood. It has a very intersting chapter on bodybuilding history though.
5,One of the Two Books you will ever need!!!!,"I read nearly twenty fitness books before I bought this one. And then I bought another one to give as a gift. It is THE reference for building a fabulous body. He does not hawk products. He gives all of us the opportunity to re-vision and revise our existing selves in the patterns of gods. Get out your loin cloth and your laurel wreath; you will soon deserve it. Also, go to his website and download his free 20 month plan. The book tells you everything. The video shows everything and the information on his site - worth more than any time spent with a failed dancer turned personal trainer."
5,The Best All-Around Book on Weight Training,"I just bought a new gym and pulled my Getting Stronger paperback out of the attic. I kept this book because it is possibly the best all around reference on weight training I have ever read. This book has descriptions of weight training regimens for dozens of sports, general fitness, advanced bodybuilding, free weight Nautilus equipment and more. Includes sections on eating well, motivation, the anatomy of the muscle, and detailed descriptions of every exercise. Easily photocopied workouts are great for displaying in the home gym. As I read through the book again last night and was amazed on how thorough and easy-to-read this book is...it made me write my first Amazon.com review. I am glad to see the book is still in print."
3,no photos - not enough instruction on form,"What is very good about this book:- A very comprehensive listing of exercises for each body part. For trainers, or people who work out regularly, there are enough ideas to vary the way you work any body part- Work out programs for various sport uses or for the fitness enthusiast- Bunks the myth that you need to eat meat to build/maintain muscle- Sound anti-steriod adviceWhat it could do with is an updated edition with:- Photographs (rather than sketches which are used) of each exercise because form is difficult to learn from sketches and descriptions- More pointers on technique and form"
5,Wow!,"GETTING STRONGER is the best weight training guide available! I am a 23-year-old female who just had a baby. I started the beginning bodybuilding workout, have been at it for a month and look great! I wish all women would try this, it's easy, fun and shows awesome results. Bill Pearl is also very knowledgeable about what to eat and how to keep your body from being overworked! It also has great workouts for all kinds of sports for men and women. Thanks Bill!-Candace"
5,Great Starting Point,"My bodybuilding efforts were unfocused until I bought this book. Although not up-to-date on the most recent techniques and theories of bodybuilding, gave me all the basics necessary to create a sucessful program. I especially appreciated the beginning body-builders and general conditioning programs, and while it didn't necessarily make creating a conditioning program a no-brainer, it certainly answered most of the questions I needed to start training sucessfully."
4,getting stronger...,"This book was recommended to me by a professional bodybuilder who trains in my gym. I have found it 'very' informative, learning many concepts & exercises not previously known to me. This is an essential read for anyone getting serious about the sport or just trying to improve their strength/workouts..."
4,Nice Watch,I gave this watch as a birthday present for my mother and she was delighted with it. It's at the same time elegant and useful - for an everday use -.
2,What a pain,"I know delivery through UPS has nothing to do you with you guys but they only made one attempt to my home before they left it in the post office. I had to make a trip on a Saturday to finally retrieve it.Also, the picture of the watch that you asked me to review IS NOT the watch I ordered. I received the correct one but after holding my breath when opening the box because the wrong product was shown on my screen.I realize that you have nothing to do with the links in the watch either but I couldn't remove the links on my own and had to take it to a jeweler and pay 10 dollars for it to fit my wrist.I will continue to use Amazon but will think twice about ordering any type of jewelry."
2,"GREAT MOVIE, LOUSY DVD",I cannot believe that IMAGE has recorded this film at a very low volume with no subtitles. A beautiful film is ruined to the fact that one cannot HEAR it. Shame on you IMAGE!
5,Seance on a Wet Afternoon,"""Seance"" works its dread gradually, like a car accident seen in slow motion. The deliberate pacing takes nothing away from the film's eeriness. Stanley is a knockout in Oscar-nominated performance. Guranteed to make your skin crawl."
1,Worthless as a DVD presentation,"A thump on the head to Home Vision Entertainment: this expensive DVD has NO special features whatsoever - namely subtitle options, or any of the perks that normally come with DVDs."
4,good information,"I have been making my own breads for many years, and I did find useful information in this book. Quite a bit of repetition, but overall interesting in the way the author demonstrated the three methods -- processor, mixer, by hand. I like and use this book."
4,Good,"My mother is allergic to wheat and so am I, so this book is a godsend to us, as it means we can now eat sandwiches. However I live in Ireland so I found it difficult to get used to ""cups"" rather than pounds & ounces, but once I learnt one cup is 8 fluid ounces, I discovered it is actually an easier and more accurate measurement of ingredients than using weighing scales. I actully want to advise anybody from Ireland reading this - guar & Xanthan gum (essential for gluten-free bread recipes) is very difficult to purchase in Ireland and I had to purchase from Oregon, USA. The postage cost more than the products, and delivery took 10 weeks...."
5,the best money can buy,this book is nothing like the movie except for someof the pictures.i first read this on a lake in canadawhile wating for my pizza to be delivered.it has everythinga fassbinder fan loves..the truth about cats and dogsetc....but this is worth every penny the publisher wants..it kicks major butt!...
2,not for current gen people,"this book is dated, predates people using computers for everything. would avoid unless your from an older generation that doesnt use computers."
2,Disappointed,"The author's original book included both Human and Animal Anatomy. I knew it had been separated and translated into English. I saw the Human Anatomy one and thought this is what was on Amazon. Instead of a book that was over an inch thick, what arrived was a book less than a 1/4 inch!No wonder it was so cheap. Having said this, I do think it was worth the few bucks it cost.Gary Smith , Art Coach"
1,It just doesn't kill ants or keep them away,"EcoPCO WP-X - 1 lb.The only way this killed the ants was if they drowned in how much I had to use. And the next day, back again.I would not ever buy it again."
4,weddings reality style,"Kinda fun,Tom is cool,but still its a reality style rag set to video.The road apple cake was a bit of a shocker(really quite funny) the cooks expression the feast d'ressitance.Neat dumpster dive tricycle(a real collectors item worth a pretty penny).Still its a reality style show.making it very debatable."
5,Great tool for Personal Trainer,"Delivery was a little slow but then again we are in NZ, the book is ideal for referencing in relation to the work I do, Personal Training and Sports Rehab. Thanks Amazon"
4,eeyore pendant pocket watch,"I REALLY LOVE THIS WATCH, IT'S THE PERFECT LENGTH WORN AS A PENDANT SO YOU CAN WEAR OTHER NECLACES WITH IT. THE ONLY THING I WOULD CHANGE IS THE DESIGN ON THE COVER. I WOULDLIKE TO SEE IT A LITTLE MORE FEMININE LIKE WITH SCROLLED DESIGN OR FLOWERS AND VINES. IT'S GREAT FOR WHEN YOU WANT TO WEAR BRACELETS INSTEAD OF A WRIST WATCH. THE FACE IS ADORABLE. IT IS REALLY WORTH THE MONEY I WOULD PAY MORE FOR THIS WATCH BUT I LOVE A GREAT DEAL AND THIS IS. IF YOU LOVE DISNEY CHARACTERS BUT THEY ARE NOT ALWAYS APPROPRIATE FOR YOUR OUTFIT THIS IS PERFECT. THE PENDANT IS VERY NICE AND ONLY YOU KNOW WHO'S INSIDE. PAUL H, SOUTH CAROLINA"
1,BIG DISAPPOINTMENT,"I waited almost 4 months for this item. Send back the first one only to have the same problems with the second, which also went back. It has problems finding networks , playing Live 365 stations , searching for stations, keeping date setting , keeping FM radio settings , etc.The idea is good but it needs to go back to the drawing board.I almost forgot. Toian customer support does not appear to exist."
1,Shame on Torian (kudos to J and R),"This radio does not work at all - customer service is non-existent. Thankfully, J and R stands by the products it sells and accepted the return. Very disappointing as the concept is great - Torian should have waited until this product was properly tested to launch in the US."
4,Incomplete collection,"There is simply no way to condense Bing Crosby's prodigious musical catalgue into 25 songs and these are far from his greatest hits or strongest vocals. It's almost insulting. Bing's great songs from his golden era of the 30's and early 40's comprise 25 great songs in *one* year.But is you just want to sample the incomparable magic of Bing, then this is a good pick. The songs selections are thankfully of early vintage, when Bing's voice was indeed a compelling musical instrument. But if you're seriously interested in understanding and appreciating Bing Crosby, please consider buying the better 4-disc collection offered on Amazon."
4,Hardball,"Even though Chris Matthews can be too high energy and over the top, his obvious love for politics is something to be admired. In an age where most pundits act as jaded as the most pretentious music critic, it is good to see someone who embraces the old fashioned type of politician, and all of the foibles they engender. His book, Hardball, is like an extended episode of his show of the same name. He talks about himself, and his experiences in politics, and sprinkles his book with some of his favorite stories about politicians and other historical figures. It is a low maintenance read, none too sophisticated, but it contains plenty of inside information about how things operate in Washington. Like him or not, Chris Matthews certainly knows the game."
5,Chris is the master of politics,"Matthews does not just give us a fascinating insiders look at politics and reveal the strategies used by these conniving rats and reptiles. He also teaches us how we, as regular non-political people, can use these devious practices in our daily lives to destroy those we do not like and raise ourselves up in society without doing anything meaningful. And of course, as anyone who has seen this hyperactive genius on cnbc knows, Chris Matthews is a shining example of how it is possible to achieve wealth and fame by doing nothing more than flapping your gums at such a rapid rate and extreme volume as to overwhelm all those around you. Bravo, Chris."
5,What a great book!,This book is a must read for any political professional. A great companion book is YOU WON - NOW WHAT? by Taegan Goddard and Christopher Riback.
4,Good.,Good. I never read the book. It was a gift to a friend. My friend says it was very interesting reading about politics.
5,The Griffin and the Minor Canon,"A truly wonderful book. I was given this book by my next door neighbour who was a childrens' book reviewer, and I have loved it ever since. I now read it with my six year old son.The illustrations by Maurice Sendak, which are much finer, more detailed and more intricate than his illustrations in 'Where the Wild Things Are' and 'The Night kitchen', are beautiful and complement the text wonderfully.Frank Stockton's prose is lovely to read, easily understood by even younger readers but still provides a salient message about tolerance, acceptance of others and sacrifice for our friends and the community.I cannot recommend it highly enough. It should be on all school reading lists."
5,20th Century Fox - 1st 50 yrs review,"If you are a movie buff like myself, then this dvd is a MUST for your collection. The clips of past movies is both enjoyable and entertaining. This was the era of grand movies, unlike what is being made today. Sit back and relive the days when going to the movies was a really great treat."
5,Loved it!,"What makes a good author, in my opinion, is his or her ability to capture the human condition in such a way that it comes across as real.What makes a good comedian, again in my opinion, is to take slices of ordinary life and see the humor in them. Mr. Smith is clearly capable in both areas. While he's not the only person (let alone gay one) to see a relationship end, his ability to harness all of the involved elements (the concerned family, division of the utensils, joint custody of mutual friends and the eventual return to the single's scene) and make them both funny and touching.It may not be as funny if you can't ""relate"" .. but for anyone who has ever addressed and gotten through a painful situation through humor, this book is a treat."
2,Almost unreadable,"I was a very big fan of Mr. Smith's previous book ""Openly Bob"" and anxiously awaited the arrival of this title. Unfortunately I found this book to be nearly unreadable. It was dull, lifeless and without anything compelling to say. I put it down after my first attempt to read and never picked it up again. You can do better Bob."
4,"Great book, Great guy","Excellent accounts of breaking up, dealing with family and rentering that dreaded dating scene. Although I was sad to see Tom and Bob didn't make it, it was nice to read that Bob has gone on with his life. Easy read and very entertaining. One more big hit for Bob! Way to go, Smith (I couldn't resist)"
2,Useful if understood as a piece of propoganda,The book is illustrative of an all too common approach in Lutheran theology of the late 20th and early 21st centuries that is driven more by humanist and postmodern approaches rather than faith or trust in the value of the Word of God as it stands in its literal meaning. It is useful reading for one seeking to understand how liberal contemporary theologians seeks to frame religious and church history so as to accomplish transformation more in line with the new ethic rather than the praxis that is more in line with a trust of the literal Scripture. In no way should this book be considered an objective or empirical exposition of the history of the Lutheran Church Missouri Synod nor a faithful exposition of what the Scripture says in its own objective voice.
1,Her true motivation for negative portrayal of her church?,"The question that stands out when reading this book is why the author stays in the Missouri Synod while she exposes every negative historical detail she can dig up. Many Lutheran churches have female pastors, so why doesn't she join them? She obviously does not share conservative values with the Missouri Synod. Why would ANYONE stay in a church whose values are not agreeable with his own? Perhaps she just wants the authority that she doesn't possess.The Missouri Synod should just encourage her to leave and find solace elsewhere."
4,Krinos Kalamata Crown Figs Greek,These figs were not as flavorful as other figs I have ordered.They were nice and big and were best if soaked in a small amount of water to rehydrate them.
2,Content is good but the sound quality is terrible.,The content of the CD's are good. The overview is a bit cursory and is not really in depth as I would have liked. The biggest problem is that the sound quality is terrible. I have to crank the volume to even be able to hear the discussion. If I am riding the train then forget about it; I can hear nothing. Great if you are sitting at home and listening in a quite space. Terrible if you are a commuter like I am and are trying to listen on the go.
4,Endless fun for your feline friend,"This toy is well made and loads of fun, and as far as cat toys go, its definitely my best investment yet. My cat will sit for hours trying to devise a way to get the ball out of the slot it's enclosed in. My only complaint is that sometimes the ball gets stuck under the mouses head and requires a little human assistance to get it moving again."
4,Both my cats love it!,"At first I thought it would be too complicated for our cats but after I showed them were the ball was, they both love it. They don't really use the top scratching post but they have learned how to make the ball keep going around and around. Sometimes they just sit on it like they are ""guarding"" their toy. It's a good toy for the cats & affordable."
3,solved the case without leaving his house,A five pound wager becomes a case of the disappearing bankerand the robbery of his safe.A ring and a pick-pocket become the key to solving the mystery.I liked this episode.
4,I'll tell you why you should buy this book,"Can't take a computer to bed and read? Have a long commute on a train, going for a ride? Any number of reasons can be thought of to buy this book. It's an app book. Great resource when something is tapping on the inside of your head. Recommended.Go used, and save a few bucks."
2,disappointed,There are two things I don't like about this book: The first one is that the print is too small. The second one is (and this was very important) that there are no pronunciation marks. I don't know how to pronounce the words in French! I don't know whether words are supposed to have a long vowel sound or a short vowel sound.
2,Mediocre,Couldn't beat the price but I guess you get what you pay for. I ordered 4 boxes. Two boxes were fine but the other two boxes I found the edges were not sealed properly and the CD pushed through the bottom or side when inserted. The majority in the last 2 boxes were worthless in that respect.
4,Excellent buffer,"Very good buffer, could be a four or a five star. Very smooth and the slower speed is useful. Works great in putting an edge on a blade, which was the main thing I purchased it to do. Assume with cloth wheels, it would make a great polisher. And it is made in America."
4,"Ah, to be young again.","This movie is just too cute. Young love, regardless of who is involved, can give one the warm fuzzies. ""Two Girls in Love"" does that. It also has some very funny moments. I personally liked the way some scenes were shot (e.g. Evie, Randy, and Randy's family cooking dinner). Granted, this film is not Oscar quality - but who cares! Get it and enjoy it, over and over again."
1,A misstep to be missed,"Unfortunately, this freshman effort from writer/director Maria Maggenti and her two lead actresses reeks of amateurism.Littered with painful dialogue and clunky performances, ""Two Girls in Love"" is implausible and inauthentic to the point of embarrassment.For a more believable (as well as more intelligent and erotic) young lesbian love story, check out the understated and off-beat BBC production, ""My Summer of Love"" (2004). A similarly themed film that's downright hilarious - and with a killer score to boot -- ""But I'm A Cheerleader"" (1999) is a gem. From the same year, ""Better Than Chocolate"" has it all - humor, originality, plot, dialogue, performances, and sensuality.The only incredible thing about ""Two Girls in Love"" is that it got released in the first place, as without its lesbian twist it's little more than a third-rate Romeo and Juliet tale."
4,"Sweet, Wild, and Adventerous","This movie was one that I saw on this web site and purchased it from reading other reviews. It didn't let me down at all. It's a wonderful love story of two totally different people from totally different backgrounds. As this movie shows, opposties attract and I think what makes this movie so enjoyable is showing that love can really happen this way. ""Tina"" from the L word does a FANTASTIC job of playing a character that is nothing like the character she plays in the L word. This film is sort of corny, but it suggests love in this way to show that other loves aren't as special."
3,interesting film,i just happen to catch this film on BET Starz recently&The acting&pacing of the film kept my attention. alot of Dynamics at play within the context of the film.
3,Better than alot of Lesbian movies,"This is a cute movie with a very real theme, it displays how hard it is to be an adolescence and be in love with someone of the same gender. The black girl is hot in it and Tina from the L word plays a tomboy. It's worth buying and it's not cheap independant film quality.The sex scene is okay...."
5,adorable baby dyke kitch,"this was the first queer movie i ever saw and as such it will always hold a special place in my heart. however, once i became a bit older and wiser i realized that although the acting is not as bad as many lesbian films of the era, it's still pretty rediculous and the story line predictable and somewhat unbelivable. the ""poetic"" ending was also a bit over the top. still, it's cute, funny, heart felt, and important. it will always hold a place of honor on my shelf."
3,"sweet, but trite","This film is cute and sweet. Definitely a ""feel good film"". But it falls flat in the reality department. The plot is rather stilted and trite. I enjoyed this film and it has its place in ... cinema history, but in terms of quality it is far surpassed by more recent classics such as Beter Than Chocolate."
2,Ok,Decent movie but not my favorite. It's so hard to find a well done lesbian movie. My favorite is Loving Annabelle and Imagine Me & You.
2,Dissapointed,"Many people had recommended this movie to me so I was excited to sit down and watch it, but it failed to live up to its reputation. The quality of the film-making was aweful, the acting ridiculously bad, and the script read like a cross between a psychotherapists analysis and one of those pulp romance novels about angsty teenagers. Yes, it is a low budget film, and yes, it had political importance in 'the scene', but as a stand-alone movie free of context and background, I would never recommend it. It gets some credit toward the end for showing some self-awareness of how silly and dramatic the whole thing was. There were some cute moments, and it was interesting to see the humble roots of one of the big L word ladies, but don't go into this movie expecting a highly polished end product."
1,Totally dissappointing,"I bought this during my mammoth search to find more than one lesbian film that to enjoy watching and this was definitely not it. How anyone can call it the best lesbian film they've seen is beyond me. Try Better than Chocolate, But I'm a cheerleader, Lost and Delerious or Porquoi Pas Moi if you want a good film. Anyway it's supposed to be a coming of age story, first lesbian love etc but I found it simply unwatchable. I didn't relate to the characters at all, the low budget quality was awful and there was no good storyline to make it worth getting over that point. If you want a really good coming out/coming of age film watch Show Me Love (sweedish with subtitles) it's excellent and you really feel for the characters unlike you ever could with this. This is slow, boring and badly made, don't waste your time on this."
2,Odd division of the spoils,This film is a not atypical Naschy exercise in Euro-horror. As such you may feel you have seen it all before (which may also make you happy). However the DVD suffers from having all the nudity crammed into the extras section- leaving the original feeling expurgated. Odd way to do this- which makes me want to await an uncut full run version of this movie.
5,The extra sequences...,"I just want to add, for anyone who might stumble upon this, that in the extras for this dvd, there is a black-out occurring about 8 minutes into the bonus footage, and it lasts several minutes. I wrote Image to see if this was a defect on my personal copy, and they responded that this defect was apparent in the original negative source, and therefore is present on every copy of the dvd. I've asked other persons who own this dvd if their copies possess the same defect, but no one ever responds, so keep that in mind. It is doubtful that another release of this film will ever come to fruition, so its hardly a complaint, but it just happens to occur in a pivotal scene involving the most interesting character in the movie. Why then, was this segment even included??"
1,"Forget Ambien or Lunesta, this game works much better.","I am always in the mood for a new game, but I really screwed up when I bought this. The graphics and technology seem to be from the early 90s. I whole-heartily regret buying this. If you have NOTHING to do, this game might actually be of some entertainment. The Godfather game is much better if you are looking for fun."
3,Not the best gift,I bought this for someone as a christmas gift and it took a week for him to figure out how to get dressed. The game is difficult to navigate and figure out how to start basic tasks.
1,"Ow, that was painful! Heh, heh, heh","I've been playing adventure games for 25 years; I'm definitely patient with older technology. But this game stretched my patience beyond endurance. The storyline is ridiculous and the problems you have to solve are annoying and tedious--not at all engaging or thought-provoking. Dialogue is a mess--poor scripting, bad translation, generally awful voiceover work (except Erika), and bizarre presentation. Dialog is broken into pieces (even within sentences) and then is recorded in those pieces. Resulting in. Stilted dialogue that. Grates. A seemingly endless monologue in the middle of the game had me clawing the walls; around that time I realized that this game was too painful to play. Adventure gaming should not be a test of your tolerance of poor storylines and bad presentation. Please, love yourself enough to pass this one by. (Oh, and why the ""heh, heh, heh"" in my title? Because all the characters laugh like that in their dialogue. Over and over. Creepy.)"
2,The opposite of a good adventure game,"Definitely pass on this game. It was so tedious that I couldn't fight my way to the end. The dialogue was absolute pants and moved at a halting, tedious speed to match up exactly with the subtitles so that- there awkward- pauses between- phrases like that kid on Malcolm in the Middle. The main character looked like he was limping when he walked, which might explain why in the heck he walks so SLOW between locations. Frequent black screens lasting several seconds between locations and insulting outfits on the women in the game complete the idiocy. Probably the worst point and click I've ever played."
1,Crime Stories,"This game is not worth $19.99. It was terrible. I play these type of games all the time, and I've never had such a bad time with a game.The dialogue was horrible. It was corny. There were times the words came up, but there weren't any voices. The clues didn't even give you any idea what to do next, or where to go.The graphics were something you'd see on the old nintendo, I didn't like how slow the characters walked, and how by clicking twice they wouldn't speed up like in other games I played."
1,Worst Game Ever,"I bought this brand new for $20 and am throwing it away. I don't want to give it away or sell it to prevent someone else from having to sit through the torture. I was hoping it would be something like the old Sierra game ""The Colonel's Bequest"" but this was horribly opposite of any adventure game I've ever played. Don't waste your time or money."
3,Fun Game,"I liked this game, it probably wasn't worth the $20 I paid for it new, but it was fun. Yes the dialog was a bit confusing, but it was fun to search for clues and solve the mystery."
1,I can't believe I actually spent money on that.,"As a big fan of CSI and Law and Order, I thought this sounded like a good game I could continue that fascinated with. How wrong I was. The fact that you have to do sixty steps just to get to your car keys when you first start the game was a big omen. The graphics are nice to look at and the detail is amazing, but I wish they had spent more time actually planning the game better and not putting so much detail into every step.Oh and the dialogue. Wow. I think my cats can think of better dialogue and their's consists of meows."
1,Works great FOR A LITTLE WHILE!,"This is the second OkiData C5500N I have purchased. When the first ran out of toner I went to Staples and found the printer on sale cheaper the buying the toner so I bought the printer and boxed up the older one. The image quality is great. Two months out of the one year warranty the new printer quit working and OkiData will not fix it.Yes, it's a one year warranty but two months out and it's broken beyond repair? Toner drums are ""old"" and not working properly according to the local OkiData repair guy. Build a quality product OkiData, not one that is designed to fail as soon as you are no longer liable. Did you get the GM business plan?I will never buy another OkiData Product."
2,Poor driver support and cardstock issues,"From a print quality perspective, this printer does a great job.This printer was purchased partially because of its ability to print on card stock. However, we have never been able to print on card stock without constant jams and malfunctions. I think it's safe to say that we've never actually printed on card stock, period.The driver support for OS X is poor. OKI presents consistent excuses about how Apple is changing their driver requirements, but that didn't stop their competition from providing usable drivers. Since OS X 10.6, there have been timing issues on driver delivery and there's currently no support for 10.7 or 10.8 without using a workaround of another printer's drivers entirely. When it boils down to it, OKI just isn't prepared to release new drivers for its legacy printers.We would not buy this printer again."
4,Minty and delicious,I just got this stuff today. Paid 9.99 for a 4 oz bottle at a health store. I immediately noticed it helped soothe my throat a little. It tastes really good. I cant tell you if it shortens a cold ( ive been sick for 2 weeks already and just got this stuff today)I will update again next cold I get but hope that wont be for a while. Ive had numerous people recommend it.
1,My Poor Stained Sweater-Vest!,"Although this mug has an attractive look, looks can often be deceiving. I was looking for a way to reduce my wasteful Styrofoam usage, so I purchased this reusable mug. It has continuous leakage and damages my chic clothing and shoes; especially my award-winning collection of imported and unique sweater-vests.Okay, so it's not the most expensive mug on the market, but since I spend so much money on my sweater-vests, I can't afford to give much to the mug industry.I overpaid for a cup that I hoped would have been reliable, but was fooled by the fancy packaging.The old adage, you get what you pay for, is definitely apparent when it comes to Totes' leaky, junky, dribbley, sloppy, sloshy and overbrimming mug."
4,Eye lashes,"I had quit wearing mascara. I naturally curly lashes and inevitably, before the mascara dried it would clump and end up all over my eyelid. Then there was the mess with taking it off.With this product I am able to bring my little peepers out of hiding. People have actually commented on how bright my eyes are. It couldn't be easier to apply....or remove.LOVE it!"
1,CD arrived damaged,"I ordered the Chuck Berry live CD off of amazon. the product that came had a cracked CD case and the CD was not the live Chuck Berry CD. It was only Chuck Berry's greatest hits. I was gravely disappointed, especially because this is one thing my dad specifically asked for, for Christmas. I had to take the CD to get the scratches removed. We had to pitch the case as well because it arrived broken. The only thing that was good was the fact that the CD did not initially cost a lot, except that what I paid to fix it ended up costing more than a brand new CD would have."
2,A Mixed Bag of Boogie,"The makers of this DVD tried their dangdest to make this DVD seem more than what it actually is...the case lists 13 tracks with 59 minutes running time, but the first & last tracks are the opening/ending titles & credits, and the 2nd & 3rd tracks are the generic backup band working up some instrumental jams, waiting for John Lee to join them. This leaves *nine* actual tracks with JLH. Hmmmm...Of those nine tracks, we get some mostly uninspired performances by John Lee Hooker, and he doesn't really hit passing-gear until the tail-end of this short gig. Despite the aforementioned caveats, the confirmed JLH fan *might* want to add this less-than-stellar performance to their collection, just because it's John Lee Hooker. Others will definitely want to pass on this disk.I give this DVD two stars, just because it's John Lee Hooker, the Sho' Nuff Boogieman, and the living embodiment of Coolness."
4,Good Concert,"a decent concert, although rather short. I did however enjoy the instrumentals by the backing band. A very talented group of musicians. I could have gotten into this more if it were longer, like stated in a past review a lot of it was just opening and closing titles and then a couple instrumentals by the backing band before JLH comes on stage. If you're looking for classic vintage JLH check out the Rare Performances: 1960-1984 DVD."
4,"Interesante juego de pasión, costumbres y reflexión","En español esta película se titula Tentación, título que no describe todo lo que la cinta encierra.La actuación describe con bastante claridad las emociones, muchas veces conflictivas, con que cada personaje vive: amor y odio, fraternalidad y ambición, inquietud y seguridad, indiferencia y deseo...Es una historia interesante, fácil de seguir pero no por eso menos cautivante."
3,Interesting tale -- Gong Li shines as usual,"Excellent ideas but there is some primitive (by Hollywood standards) transitions and scene cuts that could have been greatly improved upon. The film has an incredible dark haunting feel to it and really captures the horror of opium addiction and extorsion. While it is an interesting study with some fine acting, western editing would have greatly improved the overall appeal. Gong Li is tantalizing!"
2,Great to Look At but not up to Par,"The 5th Generation of Chinese Film Makers have given us some of the best foreign cinema in recent years. Chen Kaige has given us two of those in ""Farewell My Concubine"" and ""The Emperor and the Assassin.""However, I must admit to being slightly disappointed in Temptress Moon. The film looks good. Gong-li always looks good. And the film does a good job showing the corruption in government and lifestyle that was the Nationalist Period. According to the film, The China of Chiang Kai-shek and the decadence of the period was not good for the people of China.Unfortunately, the film is ultimately too slow. The film lacks those unforgettable moments of the many 5th Generations films.Yes, the film is a good period peace. Yes, the film shows the horrors of Opium. But ultimately, the film is just too much on the slow side."
4,Easy to follow!,"I love this series of books. I first started using them with the Pre-K set and now am using other levels in private groups. I like the pace, I like how it's organized. Very clear and easy to understand from a teacher's point of view and fun for children. My only problem is that the activities for each unit are extraordinarily repetitive (you create a memory game for every unit of study, a bingo game for every unit, and so on and so forth). This is fine as a starting point if you're stuck for ideas (the kids don't seem to mind), but I've found myself having to research a little further to find good Spanish games and creating them from scratch. Another issue that has bugged me are the songs. They're great for the most part, but all of them rely on familiar English-speaking tunes. Tunes with a rhythm that not always goes well with the lyrics provided in Spanish...!! But on the whole, a wonderful series! Best I've found so far!"
2,Gerber 22-41526 Mini-Fast Draw Spring Assisted Opening Stainless,"The knife is well made, but the blade lock on mine makes it way too hard to to open this small knife. Keeps engaging it while trying to open the knife."
1,keep looking,The fast draw isn't that fast and the pocket clip broke in a few days. I don't recommend this knife.
4,Very fascinating,"This was a really quick read and very fun. For those interested in history, it offers insights into the factors leaders had while making decisions that few of us common people would have known about."
4,Truly analyzing how decisions were made (and probably how they still are made),"This book by Christopher Andrew represents the U.S. presidency and intelligence operations from President Washington's massive network of spies to subvert British operations; to President Bush and the CIA's involvement in Operation Desert Storm. Very informative book, definitely recommend it to anyone who is interested in the U.S. presidency and the paradigms that surround the decisions (and in-decisions) of U.S. foreign policy."
5,Great History Lessson,"This book is a great history overview of US intelligence agencies. It is interesting to see the different tug-a-war battles going on between the different agencies in the IC, and how different personalities of the US Presidents were reflected in their leadership style. You get more then Intel out of this book, you also get a reflection on how the past Presidents managed internal struggles; which ones lied to us; and how they managed international situations. You come out of this book knowing that we need a strong IC, but an effective IC would only be one that has both Presidential and Congressional oversight."
4,Goes where no other book has gone.,"For the President's Eyes Only gives readers tremendous insight into the U.S. intelligence community, including the good, the bad, and the ugly. Every student of political science and criminal justice should read this one."
4,Tops for dog lovers.,"This series is a wonderful series for those who love dogs and love to read mysteries. I happen to be one of those people. I don't have Malamutes, but I have two dogs - a Rottweiler and a Belgian Shepherd, and believe me I often see my dogs in things that Kimi and Rowdy do. I also like the series because Ms. Conant relates everything to dogs and to dog training. It is remarkable how valid this. In this book we also get a new character in Holly's young cousin Leah. I think we'll be seeing more of her. The book is about a murder that was at first not thought to be a murder, but Holly senses that someone did her friend Rose in. In her quest to find answers she runs across a truly disfunctional family. Trying to make sense of this family by comparing it to the dog world actually works for her, and she does manage to figure it out in the end. I'm lookimg forward to the next book now."
2,Didn't really help,"To be honest, this product didn't work for my acne. If I used it on entire face, then the face gets really dry and itchy. Then I tried on spots only. But it did nothing to reduce acne. Sorry, didn't work for me."
1,CAUSES ALLERGIC REACTION!!,"IT WILL CAUSE ALLERGIC REACTION, IF YOU ARE NOT SURE WETHER YOUR SKIN CAN HANDLE IT OR NOT, DONT GET IT"
5,Excellent WW1 Account from a woman's perspective,"This small volume has a lot packed into it. Written shortly after the war, this is an amazing account of a domestic situation affected by the return of a soldier from WWI (hence the title). It is not sentimental in my opinion, but shows selfishness, manipulation and a desire to maintain appearances no matter the human cost. The account is very evocative and startling in its own way, and while it is fiction I feel that the roots of the story may originate in actual events. I would highly recommend this book to round out anyone's knowledge of the aftermath of WWI in England."
4,"Sad, worthwhile read","My book group read this last month. The writing is very dense--every word feels very deliberately chosen. I would like to re-read this book and revel in the use of language, now that I know the plot and can spend more time on the writing style."
1,Worst Edition Ever!,"This is the worst edition of a book I have ever read. There are numbers instead of letters, a huge number of misspelled words, and new paragraphs are inserted in the middle of sentences. Never buy this edition if you actually want to be able to read this book. Get another edition of West's novel; it is worth the extra few dollars!"
1,Optical Character Recognition Nightmare,"Be aware that the General Books edition of this novel (ISBN 978-1458936745) was created by scanning a copy of the novel from the U of MI library, and the text is rife with garbage characters and random paragraph breaks, to the point of being unreadable. I'm sending mine back and getting a used copy of a real book. Caveat emptor."
3,Interesting,"It's a very interesting history. A little old-fashioned.Rebecca West proves to be a good psychologist. It's surprising the importance that people gave in 1915 to the clothes and the way of life. The past returns and surprises everybody, it also has surprised me.On the other side, it results a lillte dull. Too many gardening description. A difficult English for a Spanish speaker like me. Slow rythm. A British old fashioned style.It deserves being read, you can dive in an old and disappeared time."
3,Loyal,"I grew up to the Kingston Trio because my Dad grew up to the Kingston Trio,and I loved them,and my father always said that John went his own way,and while my father stayed conservative, John ""got weird"",but I thought otherwise, John grew, and adapted, and expressed with charisma and unique emotion,something folk, but not really modern ""country,"" something rock, but not just screaming and tricky guitar,pop but not just catchy repetition...His albums, especially the basement tape type releases, are incredible, experimental, rough, flawed, authentic, intimate jewels.I missed the chance to see him while I was living in L.A. a few summers ago,which is tragic because he passed away shortly there after,which greatly saddened me,because he will always have an impact on my soul, my heart, my feeling of loneliness and manliness.Here's to you John.Thank you."
4,Good reference book - ideas still relevant,"This may have been written a while ago, but the information is timeless and well written so this is one of my few self-help books that I hang on to ad it's full of good ideas."
4,Wonderful Crib,"We bought this crib and brought it home in the back of our SUV (one nice neat box). I (7-months pregnant) was ale to put it together by myself (I just could not wait). It looks great in the room and it is by far a lot more stable and secure then the majority of the cribs out there. The only thing to note is that the wood is VERY soft and dents/scratches will be easily visible. Overall, I am thrilled with this crib."
3,Crib Dimensions,I need help! Does anyone know the dimensions of this bed? I have the crib and an a matress on my registry. I'm wondering if a standard size matress will fit in the crib.
1,Shop around first,This is a nice looking crib but the quality isn't the greatest. I noticed it right away once I got it home. I didn't realize what soft wood this was made out of. We had a zillion scratches in it before we finished assembling it. We were hoping to use it as a full size bed but I doubt it will ever make it that far without looking hideous. I didn't realize at the time I bought it that it needed the full size bedrails to convert this into the full size bed which adds another 90 dollars or so onto the price.Shop around first! I should have bought a Simmons or Childcraft.
1,Oak Crib is really PINE,Don't listen to the other reviews. This crib is made of PINE and is really soft. Right on the box I received it says PINE. I even called the supplier (...)and gave them the model number DA715BC. They confirmed it is PINE wood and a dark PINE color. Buyer beware.
4,"nice looking crib, solid!","I purchased this crib for my son to be born in february 05. It only took a week to get in store. I helped my husband put it together and was very easy. The mattress spring was a little difficult but if you place it together as the directions say the bars fit prefectly. I think most people had a problem with it because they placed it upside down then the bars are in wrong position. Just read directions and take your time, it also helps if 2 people can assemble together. Standard size mattress will fit the crib. Only down side is that the rails are so much thicker than standard cribs the mobile i bought wouldn't fit."
4,Good Value and Looks Great,"I was worried when I read the first review with the negative comments about quality. However, I was very happy when the crib and matching dresser arrived. They are beautiful. There were no scratches and the wood does not appear soft or easily damaged. I would give this item five stars except that there was a piece missing and it must be ordered...have to wait a week for it to come in."
4,Best Crib Yet,"I purchased this crib for my daughter when she was born in 2004 in New York and moved to Florida early last year. The bed is still in gread condition, a few scratches due to the move and baby biting the wood but we are so glad that we got this bed. We need to convert the bed into a toddler since she is now learning how to climb out, and she's only 20 months. The only downfall as other mothers mentioned, there is no way to lower the gate. I'm 5'7 and it was hard for me to put her down when she was asleep. Other than that, it's a beautiful bed and i'm glad that we purchased this one."
1,No Teething Rail Available For This Crib,"When I purchased this crib in the beginning of 2005, I had read the review stating someone found a teething rail to purchase, that would fit this nonstandard design. Now, that my son is teething, I tried to order that rail from that site and it is no longer available........I know a 300 piece of furniture will not last eternity....but I believe it should make it past 6 mo. If you care about the rail being thrashed, I would not recommend this one...although it does look good prior to those first teeth coming in! The company was of zero help, also."
3,additional piece for future bed,"i love the look of this crib and hope it serves my baby well. So far, my two month old is not sleeping in it, but when he does, i already know that i need a step stool to put him in it and take him out. i will be looking into teething rails soon. my main concern is i bought this mostly to use for many years. the crib came with a rail. i am assuming this is for the toddler style bed. Does an additional and separate piece need to be purchased for when it is time to convert to a full bed? If anyone knows, please advise."
2,Scratches,"The crib is pretty, but I have to be very careful not to touch it with anything because it will scratch it. I noticed my cat walking around the edge of the crib and her nails were scratching the wood. My son is only 6 months old and I don't see him being able to use the frame as a bed. By the time I am able to change it to a bed, I am sure it will look even worse. I hate to see what it going to look like when he can pull up and chew on the rail."
1,Do Not Buy This Crib,"Do not buy this crib unless you want to give yourself a terrible migraine everytime you want to adjust the mattress height.Supposedly (and I say that sarcarstically) you can adjust the spring that supports the mattress, but this nearly impossible unelss you take a sledge hammer to it and bend the bars that attach to the screws to make it fit (and I'm serious about the sledge hammer).It's not worth the headache."
5,Beautiful Crib...Well worth the wait!,I was on a waiting list for 2 months before my crib was available at the Baby's R Us in Austin. We brought it home and put it together in about 45 minutes with no problems. We did not have any trouble with the wood being scratched during assembly which I had read about in other reviews. It is sturdy and looks wonderful in the nursery. We are very happy with the crib!
3,BE SURE TO PURCHASE RAILS!!,"We purchased the ""lifetime"" crib, but didn't find out until later that the ""lifetime"" part only applies when you spend an additional $59.95 to purchase the rails to convert to the day bed. I wish we would have known this ahead of time, we would have included that cost into our overall budget. And, after talking to a Babies R Us associate, she told me to purchase the rails ASAP because you never know when a manufacturer will pull or discontinue their products, which means, your lifetime crib will be no good unless you can get those rails!!"
1,defective,"We were so excited to put together the crib because it matched my other furniture perfectly. We were almost done with the assembly and realized that the screw holes for raising and lowering the mattress were stripped! We could not tighten all the screws as they just kept turning! Talk about a safety violation! What a waste of our time. We returned the crib and purchased another brand, which I hope works out."
3,On the fence about this set,"I ordered this table & chair set. Pros - Shipping and packaging were great! Cosmetically it's a nice set. However, Cons - the measurments are not what are provided in the description. It states the measurements for the DINING TABLE are 30"" X 48"" when they're actually 36"" W x 56"" L ... that's quite a difference. I'm all for getting more than you paid for, but when you have limited space every inch counts. There are also a few screws that will not screw all the way into the holes by almost 1/2"" and the screws constantly loosen. There is also a yellow stain on one of the seat cushions."
1,Disappointed Buyer,They post the whole set and when it arrive in my home it's only a table. Clarify it several times before you put in your order. Check it a couple of times.
1,Waste of money,"No matter how I try to justify my reasons for buying this book; upon completing the whole book, I'm forced to condemn the contents of this so-called spiritual text by an accomplished taoist master. Its a total waste of money but I must admit I was lured into buying this book by its cover title. Never judge a book by its cover apply to this book in an inverse sense."
4,Different Tempo!!!,"I have this CD and wanted each song on here but done a little bit differently. These are all re-corded for this album. It does have very good back-up and the beat is different. However, her voice (which would be the reason I bought it) is passed over the back-up ocassionly and not blending it seems. Notheing surpassing the original recordings of My Happiness, Among My Souvenirs, and Who's Sorry Now by Connie but these versions are wonderful! The whole album is put together for I appreciate the listing of the other songs in between but the master voice does not need the studio to do what it did. he does qu;ite well on her own thank you...Enjoy it though for its full of great songs that all not necessarily HER hits but nice covers. I love you Connie! Especially MISTY BLUE wish they would have let you and the band do it without their smothering you."
1,Literally stinks!,"The gun works fine, and has a good selection of features and attachments for the price. Unfortunately it emits an acrid smell like that of burning plastic. It continues to reek after it is off. We had to put it outside. We planned to use this for shrink tubing on electrical projects, but now consider it unusable for anything but outdoor projects on a windy day. We're returning it."
5,A beautiful and exciting presentation of Napoleon's life,"Historical Atlas Of The Napoleonic Era is a beautiful and exciting presentation of French conqueror Napoleon's life, ambitions, battles, military genius, and legacy. Full-color maps, artworks and illustrations on every page add a visceral touch to descriptions of battles, Napoleon's tactics, and also his most costly mistakes. Though Napoleon's warfare spread misery to many, his dream of a unified Europe persisted long after his passing and is realized today, at least in part, by an increasingly synchronized Europe and the introduction of a single European currency. Historical Atlas Of The Napoleonic Era is an exciting and detailed chronicle of a turbulent era in European history, and a welcome addition to personal and library history collections."
2,Don't look at the video,"I haven't seen the older movie of the same name, which is also in my watch list, but this 2008 movie is painfully bad. I'm glad it was free streaming on Amazon Prime, because the only thing I wasted was 90 minutes of my life. Really low budget all-around."
4,A National Geographic look at sea life and scuba diving,"This is a beautiful book for children, chock full of vivid, colorful photographs of fish, sea creatures, and shells. Also features many photos of children scuba diving, beach combing, exploring shipwrecks, fingering treasure, and interacting with sea creatures."
5,A book written from the heart,"Having read her ""Yesterday's Children"" I can only say she has really outdone herself now,excellent writing. Just like she was in the room telling her story."
5,Great book,This is another excellant book by Jenny Cockell. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in the deeper implications of reincarnation and of humanity's inter-connectedness.
1,Is she kidding?,"If you're a beginning or moderate stepper, this is not the video for you. You also need a ton of space to do the moves she's showing in here. I just found her totally annoying."
2,Not for beginners,I have only tried to do this tape twice. It is definitely not for beginners. I could barely keep up with the girls in the back who you were supposed to watch for the easier versions of the moves. I am sure this is a great workout for advanced steppers.
3,Advanced,"For years, I've had only one step dvd. I really wanted to add some new routines to my step workout and thought I'd try some Christi Taylor workouts due to their high ratings. I purchased her Mission Possible along with this dvd. First off, I consider myself an intermediate/advanced stepper...I am not new to step. I realize whenever I work with a new routine, there's going to be a learning curve. I found this dvd to be so frustrating. I quit before finishing the workout. Instead of feeling as though I'd exercised, I was angry. I think it will take some time to learn her moves. Even the ""move master"" doesn't repeat enough, and any turning move is problematic because your back is to the screen some of the time. I will give it another try, but will expect to start and stop the dvd frequently so as to better learn the move. If you're familiar with Christi Taylor, you will probably like this dvd. If you've not done her routines before or are new to step, expect a steep learning curve."
2,Way Too Complicated!,"This DVD is way too complicated. It makes you have to think entirely too much so you won't get your heart rate up enough to maintain it for 30 minutes. The instruction part is too complicated also. She really doesn't teach you step by step. It's one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, but she doesn't give you heads up on where she is going. You'll get lost after one, two.Try Jin Miller's Simply Step. It'll keep your heart rate up with basic stepping."
2,Too complicated with lots of twists and turns,"I do not like overcomplicated stepping routines with lots of twisting and turning, and this was such a video. I tried it twice, and had to concentrate so hard on not tripping and falling, that I got a poor workout. I don't mind having to take 2-10 times to really learn a routine and follow it well, but this one discouraged me, making me think it would take forever to get, and I might eventually hurt myself in the process. It's for very coordinated people, not me! I like good workout and a bit of a challenge in following to keep me interested, but not this much. Too fancy dancy."
1,not for newbies,"I have done step before, albeit a while back. I should have paid more attention to the reviews, this dvd is HARD!!!! The choreography is fast and actually a bit dangerous. Even the move master moves too quick. Will put this one aside for later, maybe even a garage sale."
2,Step Aerobic Christy Taylor,"This is an advanced video, more geared toward dancers than a home fitness vehicle. Easy to get hurt with this tape. No warm up, complex spinning moves while adding the vertical component will surely bring injuries to any beginner/intermediate."
2,"If you don't have a lot of time, don't bother.","As someone who has limited time to workout, this video is NOT what I need. I kept having to stop and start trying to figure out how to do the steps. I do quite a bit of step aerobics and still found Christy's DVD to be very complicated. The instructions are not clear and she does not slow it down and let you figure it out before moving on. I finally gave up and shelved it along with another one of hers. I won't be buying anymore Christi Taylor DVDs."
1,NOT for 2 left feet & NOT for choregraphically challenged!,"I AM SO DISAPPOINTED! This DVD is WAY TOOOOOOOO difficult. The ""Movemaster"" section was supposed to help those of us who are challenged with step aerobics and it doesn't help at ALL! She goes straight through the combos which twirl around, over, up, stretch, kick, knee up without slowing down or breaking the steps down. There is no way I can ""master each move to perfection"" as advertised. This DVD is a joke! And the ""Invisible Warm Up"" ha! She jumps right into aerobics without stretching anything BUT then I couldn't keep up anyway because she changed everything so fast. NOT FUN! WASTE OF MY MONEY when I thought I would get a DVD with Step Aerobics I could do! Don't buy this!"
5,Glenn Still the Best,"I don't know what a couple of the other reviewers are listening to. Glenn is in fine voice on these recordings. As on his other albums, Glenn has carefully chosen songs that suit him lyrically and musically. Most of these songs have been hits for other singers, and on most of them Glenn's version is better than the original. I would go so far as to say Glenn does the best versions I've ever heard of songs such as ""Help Me Make It Through the Night,"" ""Green, Green Grass of Home,"" and many of the other songs on this 2-CD set. No one can sing a sad song like Glenn Yarbrough."
2,"The old is good, the new is weak.","Some of the old strength and resonance comes through on the favorites, but the majority of the songs seem strained and weak. Not all of these songs are right for Mr. Yarborough."
2,whats wrong glenn????!!,"Glenn as u can see im a huge fan of your honey toned vocals.I have gotten many of your albums and each marinade in my soul. But i wonder all the other cases have you with a cheer. But, not this one u look like poopy from a toilet. Like some ripped out your honey filled soul, and put in a heart full of poopie an evil. Is it your bowls do u have diahhrea or are u constipated who no's. The music is there but the cheer is not. and Mr.Yarbrough when your not happy im not either. NO longer can i pleasure my self thinking of that sad face cause all i see now is a frown. But, no i still love u BABE!!!!!!!"
4,Great Songs,"The songs on this album are really great and catchy, especially if you want an album to sing along to. I've been a Bucks Fizz fan since the Eurovision, so I love this album."
5,great safety glasses,"I really like these safety's I wear them all the time.They seem to wear well, all my friends want a pair too."
4,Wonderful mix of history and travel information.,"This book is full of wonderful facts and tidbits about Honduras. It contains information about the well known tourist spots such as Copan and the Bay Islands. But it also highlights lesser known out of the way tows such as La Esperanza (My hometown) and Gracias. I enjoyed it thoughrougly and refer to it often. As a bonus, It is full of historical facts from Pre-history , The Colonial and Republican eras and the not too distant past. I love it. Carlos Rosa Miami, FL"
5,A Fantastic Book!,"I would recommend anyone whose interest is Math to have a lookat this fantastic new book. You maybe new or have had a trainingin Linear Algebra, this book is one that you should at least read through, or use it as class text, or as a companion text orhave it as one you would like to have a great math in yourcollection. If you are not yet convinced, there is even a sitewhere you can read the full version online at:. ....Then ...place an order online."
4,Matrix Analysis and Applied Linear Algebra,The book is ok. But It has A lot oF math proof and Word problems
2,"Warning: book does not ""stand alone""","Very cute. I used to love Nancy Drew books, so I thought this would take me back, but on a psychic/finder/foretelling basis. Despite all the typos, I became engrossed in the story. It suddenly comes to a sudden halt, without answers to a LOT of questions. Nothing in the description warned that this Kindle edition book wouldn't stand alone (as most books in a series do), and I will not be buying the ""before"" and ""after"" books for the answers."
5,Fun,"A little predictable but still fun. As much as I've read, it's hard for a book to surprise me anymore though."
2,It is ok.,Plot is predictable. I thought the author could have explored the characters more because they seem a little flat. Nothing special about this book or the way it is written.
3,"Light reading, Great YA read.","The story was a light read which was nice considering I was reading it on breaks for work. It was short and kept me intrigued for more. I am thinking about purchasing the next book.One distracting issue with this kindle edition is some grammatical and formatting errors. A little distracting when it happens when you are in the story and it pulls you out.The characters are believable high school characters with your typical, ""I'm special but I wanna be normal"" angst. Nothing new here but still a good read."
3,So many typos,"I will admit, I did download this because it was a free download at the time. I'm glad I downloaded this book for free when I had the chance as I would have been very disappointed with the price I would have paid.The spelling errors throw me off. There are so many. This is clearly an edited book, so why were those not fixed? Secondly, the characters are in high school. Sabine comes off, especially nearer the end as an adult. She's being sort of preachy in my opinion.This book has a good plot, and once Sabine starts to embrace her gift and get out of her comfort zone, the plot picks up. I just really do not like how the book ended either. We're left with a giant cliff hanger. She is given a box and the story ends.This really isn't a bad read, I'm just really unhappy with the amount of typos contained within. I think that really made this book a harder, less enjoyable read."
3,Easy enjoyable quick read,"Yes it had its issues with grammer errors. But it was a fun book. The cliffhainger end did not leave me quick to get the next book. I may end up getting the next book to read on, but do not feel the immediate draw some books leave."
3,Interesting,"This book is about a teen psychic who is struggling to find her place. She must learn how to live with her ability without becoming an outcast at her new school. Although I am not the target audience, I did enjoy this book.I was, however, disappointed in the ending. It was very abrupt, and left multiple parts of the story unresolved. I understand setting up for a sequel, but NOTHING was resolved."
3,Not sure what I was getting,"I was not clear on the fact by this page that I was to be getting adeck of cards with a child's book on each card, but I will tell you that I actually got a lot of great ideas off of the cards. In fact, I am ordering ""If You Give a Mouse a Cookie"" from one of the cards now. I had heard of this book a long time ago, but reading the card today made me remember it. There are a lot of other titles in there that I will be getting also! END"
5,Not just for moms and dads to enjoy!,"Even if you don't have a child to share this book with, you'd enjoy seeing what babies everywhere are doing! I would share this book with preschoolers--either to rememeber their babyhood, or if they have a new baby in the house. The text is simple, and could apply to a preschooler's life as well. The illustrations are tastefully done, with much detail, and use a variety of colors and layouts (some are full page, others have more white space). The babies and families portrayed are quite diverse, and are drawn doing different activities within each ""every day, everywhere, babies are..."" that occupies the page. Overall, I recommend this book to anyone who loves to see babies in all aspects of life!"
2,family diversity,"This book has a really cute text and super cute pictures. Based on those two things, I think anyone would love reading this to the young children in his/her life. The important thing to note, however, is that it depicts quite a diversity of families, including what seems to be homosexual ones. Some people will consider that a reason TO buy this book, while others will consider that a reason NOT to buy this book. It's just good to be informed of that key factor prior to making the purchase."
4,A Favorite,"I'll start by saying this has been a favorite of both my children (ages 21 months & 6 1/2 yrs). The rhyming text flows beautifully and it's illustrations are colorful and detailed. My only drawback to this book (as other reviewers have pointed out) are a few of the illustrations depicting same sex couples. While this is an acceptable lifestyle in the eyes of many, it is not something that is condoned in the bible. While one of my children (the 6 year old) has (limited) knowledge of this practice, he also knows what our values and morals (as per the bible) say on the subject. Therefore, I do not try to ""hide"" every mention of such a lifestyle, but use it as a teaching opportunity. At a very young age (0-3 years) he did not even notice these pictures and so it was not an issue. My daughter as well has not taken notice of these illustrations, she very much enjoys listening to and looking at this book."
2,"I know, most people like this","but neither I nor my daughter (8mo) found it compelling. Blah blah blah. Overly sacchariney sentiment, boring text, and the pictures are not engaging. Buy ""Baby Boo"" instead - that book is truly a great book for babies!"
1,Illustrations with Same Sex Couples,"While the illustrations of the babies are adorable, I found the pictures with same sex couples to be inappropriate for my young children. I am glad I got the book from the library; it will be very easy to return!"
5,"Every Day, Everywhere, I will read this book","When you have a baby that likes to have you read the same board books over and over, you want to be sure to have ones that are fun to read, and this one is one of the best. It has a nice rhythm that makes it easy to read. The pictures are great, especially the exhausted look of some of the mothers."
3,Subtle same-sex couple illustrations,"Parents and gift buyers should know that there are same-sex couples illustrated in 2 different places within this book. The first is two women asleep in a bed laying across one another. The second is two adult men walking together, arm over shoulder -- in fact, they are the only adults in the picture without a baby. It is unlikely the inclusion of both pictures is unintentional; it is, however, unnecessary. The book is cute and clever; thus, my husband and I were surprised and disappointed to see inappropriate pictures in a children's book. The awards, good reviews, and failure of the publisher to disclose the inclusion of this topic is misleading for consumers who would otherwise choose not to make this purchase."
1,Agenda-driven!,"On the surface, this book is charming--the illustrations are masterful and the simply rhyme is captivating and heartwarming. However, there are at least four depictions of same-sex couples. Only three of these couples are pictured with babies. So, the 'families-are-diverse and we need to reflect that' argument doesn't even work here. These pictures are not even subtle. We're not talking two men walking together--there are two men with their arms around each other. And two women lying on a bed while one rocks a cradle. As the illustrator herself notes on her website, 'Children read pictures. They really do.' I don't wish eternal damnation on the authors as another reviewer (on Barnes and Noble's website)suggested (although I think that review is a publicity stunt). I simply want them to keep their agenda to themselves and not try to force it on my preschoolers(the target audience, by the way)."
1,Not so innocent,"I agree with the prior reviewer. Althougth subtle and easily overlooked, the homosexual undertones of the few sketches surprised and disappointed me. Although this may be ""politically correct"" it is NOT biblically correct and not something I would want my children to think is OK. If you are trying to instill Christian values in your children, be very discerning as to what they are exposed. The things we may overlook...our children may not."
1,Watch Out!,"This seemingly innocent book about the beautiful things that babies do and what a joy they are to be around includes lesbian and gay parents in its illustrations. My daughter LOVES babies, so I thought this would be great! In fact, the words of the text are fabulously cute rhymes, BUT I do not need her to be exposed to these alternative ""families"" at such a young age. Thus, I do not recommend this book for anyone wanting to celebrate the innocence of babies."
3,Eliz Kay,"My baby totallyloes this book, especially the ""jiggety jiggy"" ride on Daddy's shoulders illustration and the birthday cake illustration. We read it over and over and over.I must admit to being annoyed with the ""politically correct"" theme, however. I object to the very young babies (under 1 year) being out and about without their mommies (of course, some don't have mommies, just daddies, and that's another review...). Babies belong with their mommies before 1 year, and the idea of a baby out with gramps for an ice cream makes me so, so sad. Yes, dads can wear front carriers and grampas can pull wagons, but babies belong with their mommies!I still like the book."
5,Beautiful Book,"A beautifully illustrated book! This book is an excellent ""getting ready for the new baby"" book. It talks about and shows all the things babies do - eat, sleep, cry, crawl, sing, play, grow... Reading this book is a great way to prepare an older sibling for a new addition to the household!"
4,Tripar 7-1/2 - 9-1/2 Inch Brass Plate Wire,Tripar 7-1/2 - 9-1/2 Inch Brass Plate Wire holds plate firmly and securely on wall. Has excellent looking brass finish. Has rubber tips to keep from damaging plate.
4,Very Complete Retelling of the Robin Hood Tales,"The Adventures of Robin Hood by Roger Lancelyn Green is a brilliant retelling of the Robin Hood tales. All of the stories are here. Robin's fight with Little John is related, as is the archery contest, Robin's love affair with Marion, and the wedding of Allan-a-Dale. All of the characters like Friar Tuck, Will Scarlet, Little John, Maid Marion, and (guess what!) Robin Hood make their appearances. Overall, the tales are well told, and the book is very complete. My favorite portion of this edition is the prologue in which the author writes from where the stories are derived. There, I was turned to Thomas Love Peacock's brilliant, if forgotten, tales of Robin Hood entitled Maid Marian. This edition will help to keep the adventures of Robin Hood in the minds of children for another generation."
4,Stealing from the best...,"It's in keeping with the book's hero that Roger Lancelyn Green is a bit of a thief. He plunders ballads, plays, novels and poems for this Robin Hood novel.Thankfully, he steals from the best sources.This kid's book is a pleasant, briskly-written version of the legend incorporating details from an astonishing variety of sources.I'm also glad to see Marian get a large role in this book. She doesn't appear in the Howard Pyle novel at all.You could do a lot worse than let this book be someone's first introduction to the legend of Robin Hood."
2,Argh!,"Okay, this book totally, completely, utterly sucked. The only good thing is that at least most of the stories are here, derived from many different ballads and such. That shows that research has been done. Otherwise, yuck. Choppy storytelling, no sense of drama whatsoever, unconnected events in a confusing sequence, and very sucky illustrations."
5,A Great Telling,"My 12 year old boy read the Howard Pyle version when he was 11. He enjoyed the songs in Pyle's Robin Hood, but he got lost frequently. Green's version is much more comprehensible. Now he knows the story!"
5,The Adventures of Robin Hood,"I enjoyed this book, my favourite part is when Richard weds Robin and Marian and my least favourite part was when Robin died with Marian and Little John beside him. It has lots of action and I liked how Robin kept being able to to trick his enemies and he was amazing with a bow and arrow. It was brilliant to read and it was very descriptive, though I would recommend it for ages 10+ because some of the language might be harder for younger readers to understandElena age 11"
5,Grows on you like a Tumor...,"On first veiwing, after having seen the first Fritz the Cat movie, you might feel like this maligned flick was put together while everyone was stoned, however, like fine art, it leaves something with you that brings you back to it again. and it seems to this reviewer that each time you come back to it, you discover another aspect of it,although not clearly definable, draws you back again....in fact, I'm going to watch it AGAIN right now....see ya!"
5,Throw back to a day when you couldn't get into rated R movies..,"Fritz,, racially charged goof on society, you have to be open minded to enjoy this"
2,a poor cousin to Fritz The Cat,This seemed like a bit of a mish mash of stories that never quite got finished and so they stuck them together and made a story line on nine lives.It just does not cut the mustard.The music is also disappointing.Compared to the first move Fritz the Cat it just does not make it. Save your time and energy and dont bother
1,The Nine Lives of Fritz the Cat,Not worth your money or time. The sender was excellent but the quality of the DVD (regarding the content) was very racial. Very insulting!!
1,awful,"The Nine Lives of Fritz the Cats succeeds in being offensive, but that's about all it does. Unlike the South Park movie, which came out in 99 and had a lot of comparisons to the Fritz the Cat serious, Nine Lives is neither funny nor smart. It's disgusting, just like Crumb's comics."
3,It's worth a glance,"This is one of those films that you might want to watch once, but not much more. It was free and it might be just the right price."
5,movie for my dad,I got this movie for my dad for christmas because I know he really likes these old adult cartoon movies. So I think he would like this as a christmas gift.
2,The Nine Lives Of Fritz The Cat,"It's not funny, it's not interesting so what's it supposed to be? I wouldn't buy it if I were you... unless you found it for $4.00 or less. This movie is way overrated. It's no fun. I don't like it."
3,They have an ax to grind,a lot of political commentary that I would have been disappointed to pay for had I gone to the concert. If I had previewed the album I would have opted for something else. But that aside the music is generally good as and voices are strong
5,A real help on a tight budget,I have the first edition and finally wore it out. When raising a family it got them in the kitchen and helped me be more creative with old standbys--like Oatmeal.
3,Nice smell for an average lotion,"This is actually a nice lotion for the price. Key word: for the price. It is average in emolliency, although I do notice some extra elasticity in my hands for several minutes after application. I originally used this in my office, but it left the use of my hands handicapped for a good 2-3 minutes, as I had to wait for my skin to absorb it and the small amount of greasiness to wear off. I think this would be best as an affordable post-gardening lotion; too bad I don't garden..."
1,DOA Noise Canceler,"Out of the box, the AHP-712's noise cancelation feature didn't work. No sound at all. Well, maybe that means it totally worked (ha!). Anyway, with cancelation switch off, they did sound pretty good. Awaiting replacement and better results.Update 12 April 2006: Received replacement headphones. They are working as expected in noise cancel mode."
1,Cheap Noise Cancelling Headphones,First pair broke within 2 weeks. Replacement pair is dead in the water after 6 months. I should have purchased a better pair... sometimes you do get what yo pay for. This time it was inferior quality at a great price.
3,"good for the price, but not as good as my old Bose.","After half a million miles in the air, my original Bose noise cancelling headphones literally started falling apart at the seams. I wanted to replace them with the new Bose 3 headphones, but the economy has been bad and I wanted to save some bucks. Well I saved a lot of money, but these things can't compare. The amount of ambient noise from steady sources such as engines is still way too high.My mom always said that if you can't say something nice then don't say anything at all. So I've given it a LOT of thought and finally found something good to say about these things. The separate volume control is very handy!"
2,Some assembly required,"I don't know what headphones you people are talking about, but I got the Altec lansing AHP-712 ones and both of the earphones fell off within 15 minutes of having them out of the package.They are taped in with 4 small bits of cheap double sided tape. This is an outward sign of poor crafstmanship that is an indication of what is inside as well. Sure it comes with some trinkets, but the audio isn't that great. I haven't tried it with a battery in though so I don't know what they sound like with that. I have a huge head and they do fit!"
3,Good unit,"This unit does everything it claims to do. I ordered mine to be delivered by mail. It arrived promptly, was well packed and installed very easily, but I am still trying to find the best method to turn the duplex on or off for various print jobs. Seems like it either wants to duplex everything or nothing. Perhaps I am getting too old for this sort of thing! Royboy"
3,All in all a worthy field guide.,"I've owned this field guide for quite some time. The pictures and text are all good. I believe it would have been a better book had it had actual maps of of the birds distribution though. Describing where a particular bird is located geographically just in words without a map is not what I like. Other than that, this is more than an adequate guide for any person who enjoys birding."
5,A fresh look at Cranberry Cuisine,"I have read many cookbooks which include cranberry recipes, but none with such an extensive look into the magnificent fruit. Mrs. Cappelloni provides the reader with an enlightening view on the subject of cranberries. I would say it is certainly the best single subject cookbook I have ever encountered. I recommend it to all."
5,Cranberry Cooking For All Seasons,Book was just as seller described it. I was very pleased with the book. It gave a information about cranberry harvesting which was very interesting.
3,Not for the expierienced.,"This is a well written book that is easy to read and understand. However, the level it is written to is of a teenager who has never rebuilt any type of motor. This book is full of broad generalities that could be applied to any type of rebuild. It is good for beginners, but if you want some serious engine building advice, then this is not the book you need. A good starting point, but not nearly deserving of the title ""How to Power Tune"""
3,"Fair, nothing to brag about.",I thought the book was only fair quality. A few interesting pictures and stories. Could have been better.
3,my,My briefs are somewhat big but large than bigger than I got. The briefs was larger than I kept them.
4,Undergarments a Must,Favorite and love convience of not having to go to the store. Would recommend this product and vendor. Save yourself some time.
3,Really cotton,"It's just okay for me. Yes, it's cotton. But, this for me almost covered my all stomach. Not like the picture, until the hole of the belly. It's really weird because of that. Maybe because i'm petite person, but have big bottom."
5,A miracle!,"You found this by mistake? I have been searching for it, but I guess in the wrong places. It is a gem, astoundingly beautiful, old time gospel songs, meant to be sung by groups of people who love the harmony of souls finding peace with one another through their voices."
3,Not all is lost,"Despite of the onslaught of instrumental bands, Threnody Ensemble tends to wade more in classical waters than the ""post-rock"" crowd. Truth is, Threnody Ensemble has produced an avant-garde album that results in half of the compositions being tedious and dissonant experimentations, while the other half being well-thought, dynamic, and beautifully executed ""formal"" pieces. The real problem is that there seems to be a lack of consistency between the avant-garde and the traditional, resulting in two extreme, contradictory facets of the group. Still, not all is lost..."
1,Listening to the Threnody Ensemble made me want to a write a,"What do you get when you add 3 parts repetition and 1 part mind-bogglingly terrible random assortments of notes and sounds? You guessed it; the Threnody Ensemble! The Threnody Ensemble is the kind of group that got together one day and said, ""You know what?"" ""Let's make something new, experimental, and totally college radio!"" The Threnody Ensemble's idea of originality is creating music that abandons all semblances of listen-ability. It has been said that good music is that which can inspire a strong emotional response: by this definition, the Threnody Ensemble creates the best music in the world, for nothing has made me angrier than being subjected to their obnoxious aural defecate! The Threnody Ensemble set out to be something new, but have fallen in with the noisomeness of all the pretentious `art-bands' that came before them.Note: A threnody requires singing, a feature void from this recording."
3,So-So Chad Mitchell Trio,"Not a bad album, but not a good one either. Would not rate as highly as At The Bitter End (best) or Mighty Day On Campus (better)."
1,Junk Or Defective,"Out of the box...on the top shoe, two of the three shoe mounting screws/threads are stripped allowing the external mic to float/bounce around which, to my surprise, ruined a nice video due to the bouncing noise heard throughout the video. On a tripod not moving, this sound is non-existant. Carrying the camcorder while recording is where the problem lies. To me the $12.00 purchase price is not worth the hassle to return it (the original box/package was tossed out, thinking ""what could be wrong with this"". Just a heads up for for future buyers"
1,Do not buy as seen in other reviews,"The bracket is crap, as the screws holding the shoes on are mounted to stripped holes. Somehow I have managed to not lose any pieces yet, but what a waste of money!! Very poorly constructed since the only part that needs to work is faulty. You are better off just using the show that come on your recording device. Again what a waste of money!"
3,"Personal history aside, a pretty good book","Dr. Ballard gives his account of discovering the wreck of the ""Titanic,"" but he also fails to give credit where credit is due to many deepsea pioneers who made his work possible. I would've been happier with the book if there were less 'personal history' and more 'deepsea exploration.'"
4,Great book...,very interesting. Heard him speak at a conference and it was pretty much the verbal presentation of the book. A fascinating person and this book gives a great history of deep sea explorers...
1,Too simple and too much introductory -not for grad student,"This book is too simple to use as a textbook. It's a nice book for undergrad class in business school or introductory class of management in engineering fields. Again, this is not the book that can be used as a textbook at all. Too simple and spend half book just for ""roughly talking"". Reader can found more reviews in ""Interfaces, Vol.29, (2), 1999"", in Book review section. The economic of technology is the more important is ignored in this book. Not recommend."
2,"Verbose, dull, and utterly uninspiring","This textbook was a requirement for a graduate-level course taught by (guess who?) Dr. Betz. I had read the entire book before the class even started (thank god for coffee), and I re-read every chapter as the semester progressed. I received an 'A' on every assignment, which is good, considering that I was bored out of my mind with the material. The book has a few interesting anecdotes, and a lot of page-filler anecdotes. It is more concerned with scientifically correct vocabulary than giving context to concept in plain English (e.g. endless ranting about physical morphologies, schematic logic, and different flavors of paradigms -- YAAAWN). Overall, this forgettable piece of work is reflective of an uninspiring academic."
1,connection speed,what speed does it connect to the internet at please?2MB per second its a parallel modem how is it governed by the speed of the serial uart please?why are there no youtube videos of fone modems connecting to the internet pleaseonly one customer per product set is allowed no really amazon and what does that mean in english exactly that the fone modem can t work at the speed it was manufactured to work at otherwise the morons wont pay more money for broadband?
3,Death Trash,"No mercy to anyone. This is sick death trash. From start to finish fullspeed ahead. This record is also quite short one just 8 song and 27.19. On the other hand this is actually enough for me. Best tracks are Pure Hate, Dreadful Fate and Realm of the Dark."
2,Not the best...,"The left analog stick never worked right; no matter how much I pushed on it, my character would walk instead of run, and it always turned one way. The indented R2 and L2 buttons are inconvenient and hard to press sometimes. I didn't find the battery life to be very long, either. I also just want to point out that this controller does not have vibration.The one good thing was the range and strength of the signal. I was able to operate it from behind a closed door and under several layers of blankets.I was disappointed with this product, and went back to using the Dualshock controllers."
2,not so good,i found the controller to work really good until the controller would not get the signal. i went all over the place trying to find out what the problem was and i eventually had to buy a new controller!!!! VERY DISSAPOINTED!
1,Does NOT match the Description!,"The description states this 'PRODUCT' is 11x6x3. They don't tell you the size of the controller which 4.5""x5""x2.5"" and it is very light weight and flimsy. This units weighs 5 oz.Also misleading is where they state this is a Sony Playstation as if it is a Sony Product. This doesn't say Sony anywhere. It's a Pelican controller with foreign writing all over it. I was expecting a Sony brand.It's a gift for my grandson, age 10, so I just hope it holds up. Too late to return for exchange now on a Christmas gift. It's guaranteed but after reading other shopper's experience with trying to deal with problems with Pelican products, they don't seem to care or answer complaints."
2,"Good feel, good look, but will work like crap after about a week.","When I first bought this controller, it worked wonderfully. It didn't lag and had good range. Although it lacked the rumble feature the feel of the controller in my hand made up for it. One inconvenience is that you need a screwdriver to change the batteries. Also after about a week I noticed something was wrong. My car in Need for speed underground 2 kept barely moving to the left. The analog sticks looked straight, but for some reason the controller was causing my car to steer left slightly. I plugged my official Sony controller in and the problem stopped. Of course this ruined it for me and I had to return to using wired Sony controllers. Although it feels good to play with it, I would recommend against buying this product, just because the reliability is low. As with the vast majority of 3rd party products, it won't last very long."
1,Never worked,"Gave it as a gift and was never worked, called manufacturer, never got back to me. I ended up buying Logitek one."
2,"Great First Impression, but....","I bought this cooling rack first and it worked really well at first. Within 6 months, it just started...not doing its job.-lint is really hard to get out after using air spray and tweezers.-the cord input area on the side starts to get loose and out of place fast so it was barely connected well-it doesn't have enough power in general if you use it for long hours, it never truly stayed cool, usually warm.Right now I use the cooler master notepal u2 notebook cooler with 2 fans. so much better, you can adjust your fans to where it heats up the most on your laptop.Good luck!"
2,Didn't last long,"I purchased this last year (2010) and less than a year later, the power cord failed. So I ordered a new one from Antec, and about a month after that, the whole unit failed. So I switched to Targus."
5,Beyond Satisfied!!,"The Antec USB-Powered Notebook Cooler was quite possibly the smartest purchase I had made for my laptop! The cooler is extremely quiet with two speeds. I first used it while sitting it in my lap, and the exhaust vents had actually chilled my legs, and laptop was just as cool! It's got a sleek, stainless steel top, easy to clean and dust. My one ""issue"" if you can consider it that, is that the rubber legs that you are supposed to attach to the top of the cooler wanted to struggle into place. They put up a decent fight, but eventually got into place. I will say right now, if anyone buys a different laptop cooling pad, they are a fool! This cooler is extremely well made, durable, sleek, light-weight, quiet, and very affordable!! If it ever breaks, I'm most definitely getting another of the exact same model!!"
5,Great!,I bought this in replacement of a generic fan. This thing is rugged! I wish the fans were a bit bigger and more numerous but it was a great buy! I recommend this to anyone who is wanting to buy a laptop fan!
4,Works well even if switched off,"I like to sit on the carpet and work and the laptop would get extremely hot because the fans were blocked when kept on the Carpet. This cooler works perfectly well. Even if I leave it switched off it acts as a good platform and the aluminum top helps with the cooling.Pros:Relatively quiet, the high speed is a little noisier, but for sustained use the low speed is fine. Its not as portable as some others but its solid and light and fits in my backpack.Cons:The only way to switch it off is to pull the USB plug out. Also the indicator light is quite bright. The fan keeps running and draining power even if the laptop is on sleep (maybe this is an issue with my laptop)"
2,Looks pretty but doesn't work,"I am impressed with the design and appearance of this Notebook Cooler, but unfortunately it just does not work. I have used iStat Pro to measure the temperature of my processors before and after using the cooler. No difference at all. Even after many hours the Cooler did nothing to reduce the temperature of my MacBook Pro. Very disappointed."
5,Super Cooler,"wasnt really expecting much when i bought this, but i certainly was surprised. it doesnt use standard fans, its got a special type of vertical blades that work really well but are silent. this thing makes no noise, and the internal temperature on my macbook pro has dropped substantially when i power this thing on. only downside, anything that draws its current from the laptops usb port is going to generate additional heat. i recommend buying an external usb hub, one that has its own power supply, therefore reducing heat generated from the cooler drawing power from the notebook."
2,Just good for several months,"I used this product for several months since I bought it. On this week, it started to generate noise from left side, and it bothers me alot now."
2,"Finally, a sturdy, affordable cooler -- Not","I've tried a number of these guys trying to keep the laptop (and my lap) cool. Invariably anything of a reasonable price was cheaply made and not durable enough to stand up. This cooler seems very solid, very quiet, and a great deal. Highly recommend.Update: After about 6 months the proprietary power connector got flaky, where I had to position the power cord in a bind to keep it working. Forced to drop the rating because of durability issues."
1,loud,"while this fan did the job in terms of keeping my laptop at a good temperature, the fan was loud. lucky for me, the cord to plug it in broke and would not plug into the port on my laptop anymore. as a result, I went to my local best buy store and got a quieter fan and I don't have problems in terms of noise or temperature. but this fan was too noisy compared to the one I got from the local store"
5,"Excellent Notebook Cooler, solid construction.","I bought this about a year and a half ago and it is still running. I chose this because of the name Antec, which I knew made some really nice PC cases.I had intended to use it for my laptop, but decided to use it for my Gen1 PS3 which puts out a lot of heat.Benefits of this:Hi-Lo switch - change the fan speed.USB PoweredVery quietIt comes on whenever I use my PS3. I had a Targus Cooler which I used for my Laptop until the fans began to make a lot of noise after about six months. I have another now for my Laptop.This cooler has proven that it is worth the money, it feels pretty solid. The power cord connector feels like it may break if you play it too much, but is far more solid than the Targus' power connector which feels far more fragile."
2,"Cord is failing, like everyone else is experiencing.","Works really well for my m11x, but the cord starts to fail like everyone else. Won't work unless I force the cord to bend in certain angle. Beware."
1,very bad cable!!!!,"I just bought this cooler in January........the cable does not work well, the connection is so loosed....I contacted with Amazon, and would like to exchange a new cable, but Amazon said the only thing I can do is to return this item, they could not do anything else......At that moment, I needed the cooler urgently. Then if I can hold this cable in a specific direction, it works....two months later, it totally died!!!!!!!!I will not recommend this cooler to anyone..."
1,What a waste!,"Within weeks of purchasing my Antec, the cord leading from the usb port to the plug had separated. It's loud - REALLY loud - although ONLY when my laptop is on it. Take the laptop off, and it's quiet as a mouse.Even on high, it doesn't keep my laptop from overheating occasionally.It's so loud that I have to unplug it when my child is sleeping in the same room. That's the biggest complaint I have with it, and while I'm shopping for a new - NON antec cooling pad :("
1,"cheap plastic smell, plus easily broken connector.","This cooler has a very awful plastic smell, usually it means it is made of cheap platic and not good for your health, what's more, this one is a good example of bad engineered product, thanks to its 90 degree angle connector, which easily broke the cable. I just upload two image in customer image section, so you will find out why.Anyway, buy other one with decent quailty and design."
3,"Good, but not long lasting","I bought this last summer July 2009 to use on my Inspiron 700M and it did the job for a while.Pros:I like how it sucks air and blows it through the sides. It definitely does cool my laptop better than my thermapak which is just used for temporary cooling. The usb powered cable is convenient. Fits my 13 inch perfectly. Not heavy.Cons: I put it in my suitcase while I was traveling and the metal part got dented. So the metal part isn't that sturdy. The usb powered cable is convenient, but it does drain my battery quite fast. THE MAJOR REASON WHY I consider this to be a 3 star item is because the tiny plug from the USB to the cooler is extremely fragile and now it doesn't even cool the computer automatically, I have to wiggle it around and try to find a position for the wire and plug to have it work. Pretty much it doesn't work anymore after less than a year."
4,It's Good Cooler for my Dell Inspiron E1405 notebook,"Earlier i had Belkin cooler which had single fan .The cooling was ok.The reason i went for new cooler is the USB power card has broken down near the USB power card neck.Antec USB-Powered Notebook Cooler ,cools the notebook better than single fan cooler.I have to see the life of USB power card."
4,A nice cooler used for other purposes,"I got this for cooling a DVR that is stuck in a cabinet. It works pretty good for moving air through the cabinet. I put the cooler on top of the DVR upside down so that it would pull air through the slats at the top instead of putting it under the DVR because it lined up better with the hole in the back of the cabinet. The reason I got this was that the fan on the DVR was so noisy that you had to turn up the TV when it came on, and sometimes in the middle of the night it would run even though it was ""off"". Since this is in the bedroom it woke me up and annoyed me.This cooler is better, the fan noise is noticeable when the room is silent, and my wife complained about a high pitched noise that I couldn't hear. I unplugged the unit and she said it went away. So I might be searching for a replacement that is even quieter, with no high pitched noises. Overall it seems to keep the cabinet quite a bit cooler, now if only...."
4,Good but a little small,"I use this cooler for my Toshiba 12"" Satellite. It works well to keep the laptop cooler, and runs pretty quiet. It would have been better as a rectangular shape so the whole laptop fits on it. If you have a laptop bigger than 12"", I suggest you look for a different product."
2,Not Happy!,I'm not happy with this laptop fan. Hardly any air flowing. Laptop still gets hot! Waste of money! Papa Larry H
4,"Works great, needs longer USB cord","I have no complaints except that my computer's USB port in in the front right side, almost opposite of where the cord comes from, and it barely reached."
5,Great Choice,"First Time I have a laptop pc, and this product fits very well, works in silence and have two speeds, it's not heavy and fits in the bag for my computer, also works for long period of time, you just plug into usb port and start working, I recomend this product even for the price."
5,WORKS GREAT,"I got this for my lap top that was just to hot to handle after 30 minutes or so...this keeps my lap top cool and my online time longer :-) and you can not beat the amazon price of $11.99, that's a steal with in it self :-)"
3,decent fan,has a switch for high speed fan and low speed but the fan does not get the corners of the laptop in which mine needed. but still overall a good cooler
3,Too flat,"I liked the basic functionality of the cooler but this particular model sits too close to the laptop. I bought its cousin, the Antec Notebook Cooler S, which allows you to tilt the laptop up a bit, as well as keep the extra usb port open. Much better."
2,Do no recommend,"It was not assembled properly, I had to take it apart and fix it myself. Very troublesome."
1,Bulky and blows out hot air,"Piece of crap. I bought this after a Targus single fan cooler I had quit on me. My laptop is small and overheats regularly without an external fan. The Targus fan I bought worked great, was smaller and more portable, inexpensive, and really cooled my laptop. However the fan motor broke after about 6 months. I ""upgraded"" to this model, thinking that something more expensive would last longer. It's bulky and not as portable as the single fan Targus. It also only worked for a couple of months. Now I can use it for an hour and then it blows hot air at my laptop, which does not help to cool it and causes it to overheat faster."
3,Poorly constructed but does the job,"A minute after I plugged this into my computer it quit. The usb cord does not fit properly into the cooler so the connection is constantly shutting off. If you get it to work, just dont touch it! Ever! When it does work, its works well and I find it just quiet enough. I just wish the quality was better. Also, when attached there is a very bright blue light emanating from the base. I really wish I could turn this off. I had to put a piece of duct tape over it, its that bright."
2,great product great outward design but piss poor hardware design kills it,"great product ..... WHEN IT WORKSI got this thing to cool my laptop when it was $10 after rebate but now after using it there are loads of problems with it. The major flaw with this unit is how flimsy the power port is on this why they used this design is beyond me, would it really have hurt to tether it on the pad. They made the hole that it goes into way too big and the connector too small which makes the pin able to be jostled and break easily. I am going to rma it but unfortunately they will only give you the same product with the same design flaw and when you rma it YOU HAVE TO PAY SHIPPING."
2,worked well until it broke,"Internal circuit board had terrible soldering. Product worked really well for 2 months and now will only work if I hold the power cord and press it in towards the middle of the cooling pad. I wish it would work, it was great until it broke. Very disappointing."
3,Not the best,"I've had this for 1 year and it is dying on me already. Sometimes it just doesn't turn on, which results in my computer overheating. Beware of this product!"
3,Check your other options first,"My laptop is quite old; got it in 2005. It started having overheating problems 3 years later. It was so bad that after an hour or so of power-using, the CPU would overheat so much and the computer would just blackout.The fan product here helped for about 2 months. Then I had the same problem as before. So I repositioned my laptop so the vents would blow at certain places. It works good enough now, but the positioning is crooked.I probably should have just get the dust cleaned out or something. So find other alternatives before purchasing this product."
4,So far so good.,Hi my first time buying this product for my younger sister she seems to like it and it's not noisy at all. When the fan is on High it gets a bit nosier but doesn't really bother me much since its like wind sounds. It is pretty portable and light as well. So far the last thing to test is how long can it last me I'll give a feedback on that too on my next buy on this item I guess.
2,Very Noisy!,"I stopped using this product after a few uses. This product is very noisy. I am not sure about keeping my laptop cool, but...I honestly regret getting it."
2,Too loud,"This works fine, okay, average. Nothing special. Doesn't really keep the laptop cool but does keep it cooler. I don't care about the light. My only problem with this thing is that it's just too loud. Not a problem if you're playing music but if you're working in silence in a fairly quiet environment, it is very noticeable.I have also noticed that the price fluctuates. Definitely not worth more than $20, or not even if you're bothered by the noise like I am."
5,Best Cooler on the Market,"I've been using the Antec cool pad for a couple of months and it is a great product! I have a Dell Inspiron E1505 that runs very hot, but with the Antec pad, my laptop internal fan never comes on. The antec pad is light-weight and thin enough to travel with. It is quiet, even on the high setting. I use my laptop on my lap and I do not feel any heat from the laptop or from the pad, and the pad is comfortable, even on bare legs. You can't go wrong using this pad."
4,works great,Have not had laptop overheat and shutdown since using the notebook cooler. I like that is shuts off when the power to laptop shuts off so it wont run constantly.
4,better than most,"I've tried several coolers over the years and have had some good and some not so good results. This unit is one of the better results. It's very durable, very quiet, and with two fan speeds can really moves some air. I purchased one for my home use and have now bought them for the kids."
3,Works well but isn't perfect,"I'm using this notebook cooler for my 13 inch Macbook. The rubber feet included with the cooler, designed to hold the laptop just off the surface of the cooler to permit air flow, are too wide to hold the macbook. So the laptop just sits directly on the surface of the cooler. That said, it does keep my computer cool, especially when I'm using it on my lap. It is also ridiculously quiet.Other issues: No on/off switch. Just high/low. A little annoying to have to unplug it after use. Also the big rubber feet smell very nasty and leave a rubber smell on everything they touch. The blue light is only annoying when I'm using my laptop in bed and the light shines in my husband's eyes.Overall I'm happy with it but it isn't perfect."
2,"Run's cool, but not quiet","I have a 13'' laptop, which heats up quickly. The Antec cooler fits perfectly and cools my computer, but it makes a terrible fridge-like sound - so I can't think while its working. bottom line: great if wearing ear plugs."
3,does the job,This laptop cooler does the job and is super quite. It raises the laptop up so typing fatique can set in sooner. My only complaint is cooler doesn't shut off when the computer is off and plugged in...so it's drawing juice all the time. Not very green - also has an annoying blue light.
3,A bit big for MacBook Pros,"The Antac Notebook cooler does what it says. I found it a bit too big for my MacBook Pro, but after turning the cooler and a bit of adaptations, it works well in cooling my Laptop."
4,Does its job,I have used this thing when one of my processor fan got failed and it has helped me a lot. It is really cool and quite.
2,Was great for a short while,I bought this in October 2008 and by late January 2009 it didn't work anymore.The usb cord seems to have a short in it. So I am off to by a new one I guess but a different brand.
1,"Fans run, temp doesn't cool","This fans certainly blow air on my MacBook Pro, but the CPU and other temps don't decrease and the MBP's fans don't slow at all. Leaving the notebook open without the Antec beneath while and external monitor is attached is a much better solution."
3,Fair- Could have been better,"As I could not decide on whether to buy the top-of-the-line Targus or this one, I ended up buying both. The Targus of course came with a million flaws and is not worth buying even if they give out FREE ones. This one makes much less noise than the Targus but it has two drawbacks. It has only one USB port which does not work all the time with all gadgets especially ones that require more power like the WD external portable drive. Secondly it is not that powerful and I can see my Mac Book Pro overheating with this one. So now I use this as a Chill pad to cool my Time capsule. I would not say it is a great product but will do since there is no better option in the market ( that I have tried )"
4,Does what you would expect,"If you want a notebook cooler, this is a good one. The pass through USB cable is nice so that you don't use up a slot. My computer is MUCH cooler to the touch then previously when using the Antec cooler. The laptop sometimes sites on it and runs for days straight and it never gets hotter than warm to the touch. I find the fans to be quieter than the other computers that are in the room so I don't have any complaints about the noise."
1,Cheap product,"The usb power connection came lose after 2-months, and the rubber pegs always fall out. I'm using it right now, and 2 of the pegs are missing, and my laptop is sliding around, so I'm looking for a new cooler. Also the price is way too high for such a cheap product."
1,not happy with it,"I just paid $28 for the Antec USB-powered notebook cooler and then a week later Amazon lowered it's price to $14.99.But that wouldn't bother me as much as the infernal blue light that YOU CAN'T TURN OFF ! Yes, near the usb port there is this blue LED that shines like a spotlight out of the back. I connect my MacBook to my speaker system and then listen to music or podcasts with the lights off to go to sleep. The blue spotlight becomes a massive blue light on the wall and serves no purpose! Why, Antec, why?Also this is not ""whisper"" quiet. For anyone else who is bothered by the chronic background noise in the world today, you can easily hear it even on the low setting."
3,"It's very loud, i said it IS loud.","It's very loud, It's very loud, It's very loud, Get Targus cooler instead if you are a sensitive person and cannot stand the fan noisy. Did I say its LOUD??"
1,sucks!,the connection keeps coming loose and now it doesnt work unless you hold it in place - useless and a waste of money
1,Does NOT protect from overheating,"My laptop was overheating and shutting down when I tried to play a game like Halo or Counterstrike online. I thought this could help. I was wrong. Do not waste your money on this if you use the computer for anything more than casual browsing (but then you wouldn't need a cooler in the first place)... invest in another cooler. Even with a ""high"" setting, this does NOT work."
1,PLEASE DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY,"This item is not worth the effort to research it much less your money. If you are curious and have money to burn then buy it. Otherwise, look elsewhere."
5,Antec laptop cooler,I can't say enough good things about this product. I had one cooler before this that was a piece of junk and made me hesitant to buy another. Wish I could remember it's name so you could avoid it.
5,Very quiet fans and does keep computer cool,To tell you how quiet this runs I turned it on and believed it was off or something but it was alredy running you cant even here this thing. It does keep my computer cool it would always heat up if I had the charger on but this kept it cool. It has 2 speeds low and high. I have a 15 inch notebook and it is barely longer than the cooler. This has 2 fans in the middle and is very good material not plastic so it will last longer. I believe you should get this one.
3,those darn rubber feet,Asembling this cooler is supposed to be easy ... just insert the four rubber feet in the corner holes. But the feet are difficult to get in. I finally resorted to using a Vice-Grip and even with that it took me fifteen minutes of struggle. Worse than trying to fit my butt into jeans that I wore when I weighed twenty pounds less than I do now. The cooler may work great . . . but the feet are a hassle.
1,dangerous for laptops with bottom fans,Read the other comments. It is true what they say about laptops with fans on the bottom. It will starve the fans for air and will damage the components. There are no warnings on the product and the company excludes itself from any responsibility.
3,"Does the job, but","More of a nice to have in strong heat situations... Does not help to ventilate the heat level too much in the MAC laptop; it is an inherent issue with the machine. Would recommend, but depends on your situation."
1,Doesn't work too well...,"Bought this because my emachines was overheating to the point of shutting down. After I got the cooling pad, the laptop still kept overheating and shutting down. I don't know how much cooling effect the pad actually has, other reviewers say their temperature gauges show lower temps, but my laptop stayed as hot as ever. In fact, my internal fan seemed to turn on MORE often after I started using the pad. It's really loud. And after a few months, the power plug stops working property."
3,Very Noisy!!!,"This thing worked great when i first got it. I like it because it was bigger than most notebook fans and could easily fit my 15 inch laptop. I would be careful though because the fan sucks air from the bottom of your notebook instead of blowing air. It wasn't really a problem for my Dell Inspirion e1505 cuz there's are stubs on my notebook so its not sitting directly on top of the fan and air can move under it. I noticed it made my laptop run cooler and more efficiently, however, after a couple months of use, the fan started making this really loud noise. Its pretty bad, I tried to open and fix it but i don't know, it must be off balance or something, but it's come to the point where the notebook cooling is not worth the noisy fan and I don't use it anymore. It still works I guess but not really the way I want it too. Also, the blue LED is blinding, I wouldn't look directly into it."
2,"Functions OK, yet poorly built","The fan was noisy, and inside it collects lots and lots of dust. The blue LED light was anoying yet I learned to live with it. The quality of the product is very poor. The USB joint was not functional for another device (say a mouse) and it went broken within a few months."
2,"Works somewhat, but don't believe the product literature","This makes a modest difference in the heat my Dell Laptop builds up, increasing the time until the fans on the laptop turn on by 30-50%. However, Antec decided to use small, high rpm, fans with cheap bearings- meaning that this thing is much much louder than the supposed 25 decibels that is claimed. (More like 50-60).I wouldn't buy this again."
1,Dissapointed,"Bought it on the B/F deal. Received it today Monday. Surprisingly fast delivery from Amazon/USPS. Unboxing/10 minutes of use review:Pros: Fits my 17"" HP okay. The bottom of my laptop is not flat, so the cooler is not lined up ""square"". Seems to be working fine so far.CONS: It's A LOT louder than I had imagined. The speed switch is also a volume control - loud and ""11"". I may get the db meter out and update this post later."
1,Not recommended,I owned 2 of these and they both failed within the first 2 years. They are also not comfortable on your lap. I've had better luck with my Logitech cooler.
1,Trash.,"If you want a USB notebook cooler that's going to last a few weeks with minimal use, go right ahead. The plastic feet came off, the power light is a blue/purple strobe that could compete with local law enforcement, and the dual cords (power/USB) is cumbersome."
2,Not Good,"Had this thing for 3 months, doesnt cool my computer. To small fans right in the middle, not enough air to do anything. Garbage."
2,cools but not comfortable for laps,"This keeps my macbook pro cooled off while running things like skype or streaming video. I've had it for two years now and it still works great. Some lint buildup in the fan, but not so bad that it affects the performance of the device, and the worse of the lint is easily reached with a Qtip.But its not designed to be used with your laptop in your lap."
4,Great Buy!,Anyone who uses his notebook computer a lot will sure need this. It makes all the difference in the world. It keeps your notebook cooled and you can feel the difference. This really works. I recommend it!
3,Bought two - one was defective out of the box,I bought two of these units. They have two fans each. One had only one fan working out of the box. The other one works fine and seems to do a very good job cooling. I don't know how long it will last given the other one was broken day one. Another drawback is that the power indicator LED is obnoxiously bright.
4,Works as expected but plug doesn't fit in one of the MacBook Pro's USB Ports,"The product works well and definitely keeps the laptop much cooler however you can't plug it in in the left hand side USB port on a MacBook Pro because it hits the power cable. Also, you can't plug in an extrnal device that powers itself over USB into the same connection because this product draws most of the power needed (so you can't plug in a USB Hard Drive, this device and a mouse at the same time. It's either the mouse and the drive or the drive and the cooler or the cooler and the mouse, etc...)"
2,both units I bought failed shortly after purchase,"The connector on the left side of the unit is poorly made and soon becomes inoperative. I've had to pull the unit apart and solder the wire directly to the circuit board to fix the problem.Reasonably quiet unit, when set to 'Low' speed."
3,A couple more cons,The USB cable does not remain flush in the port. I have a Macbook and I find myself having to keep something on the cable to keep the cable positioned in such a way that the unit remains on. The second con is the the little rubber nubs that keep your laptop at a distance so that it can be cooled come out very easily and can be lost. I now have to contact the manufacturer about extra parts. This would be a fine product if manufacturer could improve on the minor flaws it has.
4,power connection issues,"I have it since more than 3 months. It worked ""very well"" until last couple of weeks when the power connection to the cooler went loose. I need to hold it in a particular angle for it to work.Its a good product and the instructions says that put the cooler on a hard surface which I did not follow. However, having a 'lap'top on a cooler which is to be placed on a hard surface does not make much sense. They can improve on the connector design.Also, the blue LED indicating it is working is way too bright. It feels like carrying a UV light source all the time."
1,Worked for about 4 days and then broke,"This product was working great, for about a week. After the 5th day, I went to turn it on so I could use my laptop and it wouldn't turn on. I tried on a few occasions and different USB ports and it still didn't work. I would not recommend this for people that actually carry their laptops around and don't just sit them on a desk."
4,Notebook Cooler,Does a great job keeping my 17 inch laptop cool. Only negatitve is it uses power from the laptop through a USB port which means it shuts off when the laptop shuts down.
3,It's good for the first 6 months,It was great for the first couple of months definitely kept my laptop cool for most of the time but then it started to get louder and didn't cool very well. Eventually it broke down completely... although it did somewhat last me for a good college year. Probably won't buy another antec
3,"No ""piggy-back"" plug","Two years ago when I bought my first fan, the supplied plug enabled you to plug another usb connecter to the back of the plug, thus saving a usb connection on your laptop. If your thinking of replacing your fan with another Antec fan save the connecter cord you have now. Love the fan but they have disappointed me with not keeping the same wire connection. Saving money I guess."
1,cable connectivity issues,"I was so happy for first few months with this fan. Cable connectivity was fine first few months but the cable started giving issues at fan side. They need to provide replacement cable. Fan is good but with proper cable connectivity, its useless. Choose something else, don't buy this, unless Antec starts providing better cable connectivity or replacement. When I started writing this review, I noticed that lot of other customers had same issues. I should have purchased something else."
2,No Lifespan,"4 stars for performance, minus 2 for pooping out after less than 6 months. I've had two of these. The first one died within the 90 day return window offered by my retailer, but I was happy enough it to get another one. Both were used only during the limited times that my laptop was actually at my desk. Eventually, though, the fans became unbearably loud and no longer cooled at all.Overall, I liked the flat form, the fan truly kept my laptop cool, and it ran quietly. Because of the short lifespan, though, I'd go with Logitech for a replacement."
5,Must have,"I worked for 17 yrs in the electronics industy. Heat and dust are not things that electronic devices like. I have a gaming laptop (ASUS G51J-A1 15.6-Inch Blue Gaming Laptop) and the battery drains in less than two hrs. This means that this laptop does get hotter than others. I've taxed my laptop with and without the cooler. This cooler makes a big difference! A good cooling unit will make any electronic device last longer. That's why a famous gaming console has the famous ""red ring of death"". All due to heat or lack of proper cooling in the console.This cooler is cheap for what it does. I'm getting more and I'll use it for my ps3 and xbox360. Now that I see how great this works, I would pay double for this cooler."
1,Shoddy Construction,"When I first received the cooling pad the USB plug on the cooler was loose and would not connect unless I held it in a certain position. I returned that one and received another one a few days later. On the second cooler the left fan did not work at all. I returned it for a refund, obviously Antec cannot make a quality product."
4,Antec does the job,"After over a month, I am very satisfied with the Antec Cooler and would order it again. Durability is still an open question, but at this price, I would be very happy to get two years out of it.PROSFairly pricedRelatively quietLight weightEffective cooling with my Macbook Pro 15""Well-designed to carry around with laptopPass-through design of USB plug frees up portCONS""On"" light is a laser-like blue LED from hell"
2,not built to last,"When it works, this product does what it's designed to do. However, the rubber pieces that elevate the laptop can easily pop out and be lost, and after a few months of use the power connector for the fans becomes loose and unreliable."
1,Broke after 6 months,"While it was working, it was fine. It kept my laptop cool, which is pretty much all I am looking for in a cool pad. However, the cable soon started not quite fitting correctly, causing me to have to jiggle it around to make it work. Of course, inevitably it died after a mere 6 months. There are much cheaper cool pads on the market with a useful life of less than 6 months."
1,Cable stopped working,"Just like so many other reviews, my cable only lasted a few months before no longer properly connecting with the cooler. Such a short lifespan feels like a waste of money."
3,Worked good for a while and then quit,"This worked good for awhile but quit. Not a big deal, but now just use it to sit laptop on for better air flow than on big arm of chair. Can't say I'd recommend it."
3,Three Years In,"I've had this cooler for three years. The first year was great - it was soft, and powerful enough to cool my laptop even when playing video games (and my laptop overheats when not running anything).However, after 1 year it became very loud and its power diminished noticeably. I kept it since I grew to ignore the constant hum, but it gets louder over time and is now extremely irritating. Also, the wire became very inconsistent - it does not connect unless the wire is completely straight. Lastly, the inside gets very filthy (probably explaining the loss of effectiveness).So, overall, if you purchase this item, do not expect it to last much more than a year."
3,Poor power supply design,"I have a Dell Inspiron and the cooler works very well.HOWEVER, the design of the USB plug (for powering the unit) is terrible. In less than a month I am already on line seeking to find a replacement. Their intentions were good - provide a USB that another USB can be plugged into so you don't lose use of the port (useful if you only have one port). The problem is in the design - the plug sticks straight out of the USB port - in my case in the back of my computer. I truly use it as a laptop (i.e. on my lap - or stomach if I am lying down), so there is movement of the computer. The USB plug bends easily and already something inside broke and it no longer works.If you use the unit on a desktop, it probably wouldn't be as much of a problem. However, it would have benefitted them (and me)to make a more right angle design with stress points for movement if the USB does come up against something. Or, just make it much stronger."
2,Does not last long,"I have had two of these now. The first one died after about 6 months. The 2nd died a couple of weeks past a year. I won't buy a 3rd one!!! The design is fair, but a widescreen computer hangs over the cooler, so does not cool the main area (upper left). It also has these little rubber things that you push into each corner, which are supposed to keep your laptop from sliding. After the 2nd day, I gave up on them, as they kept falling out, so, my laptop sat very precariously on the cooler, sliding with the slightest movement. I am now is search for a decent cooling pad.Just too much work, and not enough performance."
3,Worked at first...,"Picked up this cooler when it was on sale for $9.99. Really helped cool down my HP laptop, especially when using it in my lap. The usb/power cable for it sucks and now it no longer powers up unless I wiggle the power cord on the cooler's end, but it won't stay on, just flickers on for a moment then stops. Pretty useless now but at least I only paid $10 for it."
5,much better than my Belkin purchase,"My Dell StudioXPS 16"" system kept throttling back when playing games for extended periods. Had a Belkin unit previously, which worked ok but was intended only for sitting on a desk and I tend to take my laptop to my recliner with me - it's fan was also failing.Bought this one and so far very pleased. The LED other reviewers mention is bright but it's not bothersome to me. The fan cools my system enough for 6+ hours of gaming (with all settings maxxed etc) even on the low setting. The fan is the quietest I've had in this kind of product to date. I saw zero slow down or skipping issues when plugging my Logitech mouse into the USB port. The rubber feet it comes with do an outstanding job of preventing my laptop from sliding around or being unstable, even when layered on a lap desk.Especially when considering the cost (<$20), I'm very happy with purchase."
3,Not for all laptop computers,"Did not work real well with my 17"" HP. I had an over heating problem and this unit did not help much. Ended up buying a new laptop... not more HP laptops for me but that is another story. A friend bought one to use on his 15"" Dell and it works fine for him. I like the fact that it sits flat and is not real thick. Some of the others are more for use on a desk and not a lap. Try it and see if it works for you."
2,Didn't work right off the bat,"As soon as I opened the box and plugged it up for the first time, only one fan worked. I haven't even had the unit for 1 hour yet and it doesn't work right. Sending it back"
3,"Great, but difficult for MacBooks","Received this yesterday. it works great for cooling and can barely hear it on the low setting, high setting is only slightly louder - quieter than my notebook fans. one downside for MacBook owners: the usb cable for the cooler pushes the power cord out of its seating if you use the cooler with the fan blowing away from you. I had to turn it around so I could plug it into the right side USB port on my mac. the fan blows directly at me this way. There is one other downside. There is a blue LED light next to the power plug. The light is very bright! We turned off the lights in the room last night to check it and we could light the room with the blue light. I need to find something to use to cover the light. It is very distracting."
4,So Far so Good,Needed something to keep my laptop a cooler and read some reviews and liked this one b/c of size for fitting in bag and how quiet it is. Some reviewers said this item is loud but I have it on a high fan speed and I basically have to place my ear beside it to know that it is on and to be honest I used feel heat radiating off my laptop like crazy before but not anymore. The only reason I wouldn't give this item a five is b/c of the usb cord I would have preferred a standard usb connector like most usb electronics use so if it gets damaged It could be easily replaced.High recommendation
3,"Excellent, but bulky and cheap USB","It's good overall, but first, the USB cord is filmsy. I didnt know it has warranty, come to find out I have ordered 2 USB cords just incase it broke again, in my initial 3months. In addition, the AC port on the unit is not tight, after 1 yr, it worn out and pretty much have to shake port back & forth with the USB cord in it to get power into the unit. The rubber feet are good, but the size is too thick, should be slimmer."
4,Notebook Cooler,"So far so good, with rebate and it is as cheap as no name brand.Shipping and packing is good. According to study, as long as you have a cooler, the hard drive last longer because of the cooling factor."
4,Does the job,"This is a good laptop cooler.Because it has the openings all over it, it works better than others.The only annoying design is that the little feet fall out constantly."
4,Better than Targus!!!,Great for the price! Much better than the Targus cooling pad - that one died in two months. This one is great - cools the laptop and is quiet!!!! Only thing that is slightly annoying is that there is a blue light that goes on when it's on - but that's not that big of a deal. Great Product!!!
2,Good for a few months.,"I liked it until it failed.I thought this did a great job cooling my IBM T60. My laptop went from a smoldering high 40C to as low as 30C. I thought it was pretty loud, but I got used to it.Then the fans started to fail. I ripped it apart, and WD-40'd it, but its just a matter of time until it stops spinning completely. I'm back on amazon looking for a replacement."
4,Good Product,"This product is great for what I need, it's actually pretty quiet, my laptop (Toshiba 300) fits perfectly and does it's works.I'd recommended it!"
4,Quiet. But the blue light...,I got it from the lightening deal so it is cheap enough to not to review this worse than 4 stars. I read the reviews before I brought it and indeed the blue light is very very bright and will bother me when I use it when I sleep (too bad that my codes need to run overnight). But I just use a tower to block it and it is fine.It is quiet.
1,air flow matters! this one got it backwards,"My review might not help anyone since for some reason this thing has many positive reviews. I can see this working for laptops with single, small fans.Otherwise ANY laptop with two fans, or a larger fan will get fried by this thing and actually overheat, not cool down. The air flow goes against the computer fans and causes them to compete for air, making them work harder and less able to remove heat. This ""cooling"" pad caused my big compaq laptop to continually shut down due to overheating. As soon as I stopped using it, everything was fine.The best cooling method honestly is just a small desk fan pointed in a direction that carries the cool air underneath the laptop so that it accelerates the removal of heat, simple, that's it."
3,Great Product!!! But bad design,"I love this product but i jus realized that it actually pulls air from your computer. This works great with laptops with a fan that pushes air out, but not so well with laptops with fans that works like vacuum."
2,Not MacBook Pro Friendly,"I bought this Notebook cooler to help cool down my MacBook Pro which gets pretty hot when playing games on it. Unfortunately this Notebook cooler is Way too small for a MacBook Pro (15.4""). The rubber feet of the MacBook hang off the unit, but what makes it even worse is the Metal of the grate scratches to bottom of the laptop. If you have seen a MacBook Pro it is metallic like to begin with, and metal on metal makes for a lot of scratching....Not Good. The fans worked ok, and yeah the light is too bright in my opinion. A little black electrical tape could fix that though. Overall for my laptop, this unit is no good."
4,It's quiet and efficient...but...,"This is a very efficient and quiet notebook cooler. It really works for my laptop. However, the problem for me (my case), the USB connection for this cooler is at left hand side, the USB ports of my laptop are only situated at right hand side. The thing is the USD cord is very short which is a good thing, but just not good for my case. So, I have to put the USB cord cross the cooler on top of the fan underneath my laptop. You can't just turn it around since the vent of the warm air will blow to you....well, you may enjoy it in the winter though."
2,very awful and werid smell. I think that plastic is toxic.,"I just got this today and returned it already. There's a very strong and awful burning-plastic smell when I first opened the box. I suspect that plastic material is toxic. I left the room where I opened the box and returned after 30 mintues, that strange burning-plastic ordor was still in the air. I will not risk my health using this laptop cooler."
2,Worked great for awhile......,"When I first purchased this a few months ago it worked great.... However, the plastic tab broke on the cord storage area and now the USB cable no longer works unless you keep putting pressure on the part that plugs into the cooler. I would have expected it to last longer than a few months!"
4,Solid Cooler,"The cooler is great at doing what it's supposed to, keeps the heat away from the bottom of the laptop and also off of your legs. My laptop has no heat output, so something like this is crucial.The cooling fan is a little loud on this unit, and the blue LED is extremely bright if you're using it at night and trying to watch a movie (or sleep), but these are both small issues for what the product provides."
2,Don't waste your money,"Whereas the unit looks very nice, that's where the pleasantries stop. The rubber used on the feet has an extremely pungent smell. I could smell it BEFORE I opened the box. The rubber plugs used to raise the laptop above the face of the unit pop out quite easily. I've already lost two just by putting it in and pulling it out of my computer bag. I will put silicon bumbers in place of these; they stick on and should stay quite well. The unit is not too lap friendly. I had it on my lap in shorts and the rubber and my legs didn't quite get along! It does just an OK job at cooling the laptop. I had a Belkin before this one and will go back to it when this one dies. One word of warning about the Belkin, the connection for the USB cord will pop out of its plastic bracket. When I get a new one, I'll take it apart and put a dab of hot glue or silicone caulk over the bracket to keep it in place..."
2,Cord to Cooling Pad Breaks,"The cord to the cooling pad broke after six months. As with others, I have to ""hold"" it at an angle. If I remove my hand, the connection is lost. I thought it was the cord but had the same problem after replacing it. I wish I had read other reviews before spending the money to replace the cord!"
5,Great Buy,"After checking out the reviews of this product, I decided to order this and I'm glad I did. It cools my 17"" laptop just fine. The motor is quiet and I like the USB connectivity; when I shut my laptop down, the cooler shuts down as well. Good product, well built."
2,Disappointed.,"I just got the product today. By the way, it only took two days to ship, which was pretty cool. I opened it, plug in the things and into my laptop. One of the fans didn't turn on. I tried giving it a little push using a pen, still no movement. The other fan was working fine. I am disappointed that it is already broken out of the box."
3,"Smelly, but works well","Until recently, I wasn't aware of a product to cool your lap and laptop. I carefully researched other similar items, powered or passive and decided to try this Antec powered. It is ugly in design and smells heavily of plastic when initially used. It fact the smell lingered many days, slowly lessening (or I became accustomed). The 2 fans are extremely quiet even on the higher setting. My Sony 17"" laptop sits atop nicely and the unit is fairly lightweight in the lap. I do have to use a USB extension cable because my USB ports are on the right side. The Antec is designed for laptops with USB ports on left side. Overall, I'm glad I bought it. Just wish it didn't have such a strongly offensive odor.Note to Antec: Lose the strong plastic odor and make the proprietary cable longer for those laptops with USB ports on the right side."
2,"HAD TO RETURN TWO, THIRD IS OK","I have to tell you the disappointment with this product is great. I am on my third one. the four rubber stoppers you have to put in to raise the notebook do not stay in place, The cord which goes in to your USB port is very fragile, and the replacement USB port has cracked off on two of these.Cooling element works, if you do not have the rubber stoppers falling out all the time. I recommend buying a cooler that has rise built in. I would never recommend this to anyone ."
4,Effective cooling.,"It works fairly well on my wide-screen e-Machines laptop with a too-hot Athlon processor. I have to set the machine off-center on the fan unit, but the machine stays in place there. The fan unit itself has very grippy pads on the bottom that keep it immobile even on the board I use as a lap-table.I generally run it at high. I can hear it, but it's not obnoxiously noisy. It's similar in that mode to a quiet desktop machine."
1,Terrible. Simply terrible.,"I used it for three days, then it died. And it didn't even really work well for those three days.Got it replaced, and the next one died within a week.It made a good frisbee, though."
2,Doesn't get the job done...,"This product was durable which was something I was looking for. I didn't crush the fans every time I picked it up, but that was ultimately irrelevant. Two months into using this product, I realized that it would never be able to cool my laptop which is sort of the whole point...Two stars for durability though!"
1,Not Worth The Money,Read good reviews on these so bought two. The first quit completely after only two months. The second is now about 7 months old and has started making a horrible noise from one of the fans. Likley a bearing going out. I like the quiter USB powered fans and general design but I need the unit to last which these have not. I do not recommend.
4,Good notebook cooler for the average laptop/X360,This a very nice cooler in that it runs pretty well and is easy to carry around. You do need to clean it somewhat regularly as it has a tendency to collect dust. When the dust builds up then it makes an alarming noise. Otherwise it is very nice and a very efficient cooler. I have had mine for 6 months and that is the only thing I can think of which gives me pause.
2,Only one fan works,"Only one fan works on this cooler, therefore only half of the laptop gets cooled... boo!"
3,"Ok, but with problem","This is a pretty good notebook cooler. It's quiet and since using it we haven't had any more trouble with laptop overheating. The problem with it is that it has these 4 little plastic nob things that keep give the laptop a gap between it and the cooler. Well they come out easily and are easily lost. Currently we have only 3 left but we've lost more, just been able to find them. I wouldn't buy this again but I won't be returning it either."
2,Bad design,"After 2 weeks power cord or female end of cooler is BROKEN. You cannot rely on it to cool. I constantly have to mess with connection for it to work.I saw that more than 1 person had the same problem,sure wished I listened to that review.If you buy this you will be sorry,oh and the switch that changes it from hi to low broke day 1"
2,A few issues,"This cooler only has one small fan under all those holes. I was under the impression that it had more than that. Other reviewers were right when they said it creates a sort of suction effect. If you do not have something in between the cooler and your laptop to prop it up there is zero airflow which renders it useless. It has minimal power no matter what setting you use. The silver color finish started rubbing of within days. I've had this product for a year and it barely cools my laptop. I'm ready to toss it. It started having issues within the first two months. The only good feature is that the cord has a USB port so that you don't waste your valuable ports, HOWEVER it is so wide that it ends up blocking my second port anyway.There are definitely better products out there, keep looking."
3,Works against the notebook's fan,"If your computer exhausts air out the bottom, this fan will serve you well, as it moves air more quickly out the bottom.But most notebooks exhaust out the sides and back (like my HP), so sucking the air out the bottom works against the computer's fan, limiting cooling instead of enhancing it. (and probably wearing out the computer fan over time). Antec should change the on/off switch to a in/off/out switch, so it will switch the coolers direction to match the computer.Check the direction of air flow in your computer before buying a notebook cooler!Antec USB-Powered Notebook Cooler"
1,DONT BUY THIS,"bought it in oct 2010, its kinda broken now... the lights cooler always gets disconnected and the fan stops all the time..."
2,"Cheap product, poor design. Didn't last 6 months","As others have said, the cord is incredibly cheap and not durable at all. After about 4 months, the cable ceased to fit into the fan and power it. I rubberbanded it together and that lasted about a month, then it just stopped working all together.Also, my Macbook sat directly on the fan so that no air would flow and cool the laptop. I purchased those little plastic disks for the bottom of chairs to elevate my laptop so cool air would circulate and this seemed to solve that problem. I should have listened to the other reviewers and loooked elsewhere for a cooling fan.A lot of work for not that great of a product. Don't waste your money.I have contacted Antec for a refund (NOT a replacement, as I don't want to have to go through this again in another 6 months)."
2,bad usb cable,I have been using 2 of this product for many years. The first one lasted for 5 years till the usb cable went dead. I like this stuff very much. It did a great job cooling my laptop. So I bought a new cable from ebay and also purchased a new one from Amazon couple months ago.This new one feels better than my old one. But the usb cable does not have outlet (it means the cable occupies one USB port without giving a replacing port). It is bad because my old laptop only has two USB ports. I am very very disappointed that both cable died after one month use (including the one from ebay)! Why a solid build product comes with such a bad USB cable?? The cable costs over $15 on Antec website and about $10 on ebay!
4,Impressed so far! Quiet and effective,Very satisfied. Only gripe is the way the mini USB power cord connects to the cooler. Wish they had done a angled power plug. I am afraid it might break.I monitored the temp with and without the cooler while gaming for 3-4 hrs+. It made a difference of abt 10-15 degree celcius.
4,tOOK CARE OF HEAT PROBLEM ON MY CQ-50,"My Compaq CQ-50 had developed a overheating problem and it would shut down after about an hour.Did all of the cleaning steps, no help.Caller Tech Support to find my extended warranty was 30 out, and they wanted $99 to 'telephone only' troubleshoot.Was told if it a hardware problem, it would probably cost an additional $400. (new computer time.)Bought this cooling unit, spent 5 minutes installing it, have had no more overheating problems.This is great as I really can't afford a new computer at this time. Now I don't need one.Only minor complaint I have is that it is not a perfect fit and sometimes it slips off of the 'feet'.That is a 5 second fix to set it back level again."
2,Not bad while it lasted!,"Bought this last spring to go with my (then new) ASUS laptop. I figured with 4 cores and a decent GPU, I could use a cooler. The Antec worked pretty darn well while it was operational. Not to the point where my laptop fan would shut off, but it would usually be on low. The fans and the unit itself have proven fairly durable, but the USB cord stinks! By November, so ~8 months the unit would not stay on. The connection seemed to be loose, the blue light would go on for a second or two, then go off. I blame the USB cable. Bottom line is when I plop down $30 on a cooler, I expect more than an 8 month lifespan. I have several friends with this cooler who have not had this issue, but once is enough for me. I would not buy this again."
4,great cooling plate...few minor issues,I have owned this cooling plate for a little over a year now. It works great as far as cooling goes. My gripes are about the little rubber stoppers and the usb cable. The little stoppers keep popping out and I lose them. The usb connector keeps shorting out and power to the cooling pad is off. I have had to replace both these items twice so now I just gave up and am getting a whole new replacement from antec customer service. maybe this time those parts will operate correctly. It actually cools well when everything is operable.
4,"Great design, good cooling, a couple of small design flaws","The Notebook cooler is well designed to cool on either a lap or on a desktop. I had another cooler and it really wasn't designed well if you were actually using the computer on your lap. Here, there are two side vents for air intake (not directly on the bottom) so that if your holding your computer the airflow does not get interrupted. It's also comfortable to hold and works equally well on a desk.The one thing I really dislike about the cooler is the bright blue LED light on the side to tell you that its on. Its just distracting. A small, dim light would serve the same purpose and not be distracting.Overall, however, a good product for the money."
2,Medicore Strenght,"My computer was always getting extremely hot (the program Speedfan said from 75-80C). So I looked around at all the highest rated fans around and I figured that this should do the job. I was really hoping this really lowered the temperature. However, I got this home and found it lowered only by around 3 degrees Celsius. Not bad, but definately not what I was hoping for. The dual fans under the holes (yes, they hard to see in that pic) are fairly weak. Like the littlest amount of air you could blow if asked to blow wind at something. Besides that, it is solidly constructed and doesn't let hot air get on your lap."
5,Antec cooler,"The Antec laptop cooler worked as advertised. The laptop fan never starts when it is sitting on the Antec cooler. The base of the laptop remains cool, even with the Antec cooler set to LO fan. I'm happy."
4,cooling fan,I like the fan. I don't like the noise from the fans though. I really hate the little blue light that is on even when my macbook is in sleep mode.
3,"Does its job, but is only limited to smaller-sized Laptops.","This product does its job well. It has two speed settings, low and high. I always leave mine on high and it keeps my Laptop fairly cool compared to before without a cooler. The noise does not bother me the least. This Antec Notebook Cooler is perfectly sized for an IBM T43 laptop with a 15.1"" screen. On my Inspiron 6000, with a 15.4"" widescreen, the cooler is slightly small. Above, I posted pictures to this page.I have 3 of these in my household, only one has yet to be damaged. The USB cable broke off from constant unplugging. Going to the antec website, you can buy a replacement cable for 5 dollars plus 8 dollars shipping. I'm sure there is a better solution as I will find one at radioshack. Since I do not move this cooler around alot, I will find a power adapter that plugs into the wall.Overall, this notebook cooler does its job. I'd recommend only purchasing one if you can find it for under 20 bucks."
2,"Not for 17"" Laptops","I have a 17"" Alienware running a 3GHz Pentium 4 which gets hot. Although the cooler is a stable platform for the computer it doesn't reduce the heat on the left side. The fans are louder than advertized and must do some good as the computer's fans don't run as much. It doesn't draw enough power to have a noticeable effect on battery life. I purchased the cooler knowing it's only 13"" using the Amazon Visa offer so for an out of pocket cost of $0 it was worth a try."
1,Junk,"I purchased this unit and after 4 months, one of the fans stopped running. After 6 months, the whole unit stopped running as the plug into the unit's power socket is loose. Should be illegal to sell junk!"
2,Fair,I prefer ac to usb power. The cable is to short and I always have to connect my laprop to a power source just to run the usb. I would not buy this cooler again.
3,Decent cooling but bad power jack design,"The Antec Cooler does a decent job of keeping my 15"" Powerbook at reasonable temperatures. If your laptop doesn't have little pads or if the pads don't fit directly on the Antec (the Powerbook's don't) you may want to pick some up and stick them right on the Antec so it'll work with any laptop. The quarter inch gap between the bottom of the laptop and the cooler is critical for airflow.Also, the power jack on the Antec is connected directly to a small circuit board so if the power plug is ever under strain it can cause the soldering holding the power jack to the circuit board to crack. I ended up having to resolder the power jack back to the board."
3,Antec USB Powered Notebook Cooler,"This is my second Antec cooler. The first works great. It is quiet while moving a lot of air. The USB connector had a ""pass through"" connection so you do not lose a USB port. The second, the one just purchased still moves a lot of air. It is, however, VERY NOISY. It did not come with a ""pass through"" connection, so you do lose a USB port. If the second had been first, there would not have been a second"
2,Worked well...until it didn't.,"This cooler was good for my 15"" MacBook Pro, for about 8 months until it all seemed to go to hell. The little feet kept popping out and two of them eventually got lost. Then the cord that goes into the cooler itself wouldn't keep its connection, so it would just stop working. It worked really well before things started breaking down.UPDATE: And now the same thing's happening to my husband's cooler, which we bought a couple months after mine. Very frustrating. I switched to one of these:ThermaPAK HeatShift Laptop Cooler 15 inch BlackIt works okay, except that it only works for a limited time before you have to let it cool off again. We've discovered you can extend that period of time by putting it in the freezer for awhile. Now that our second Antec cooler has died, we'll probably get a couple more Heatshifts and keep one in the freezer at all times to rotate them in and out. At least there's no plugs to come loose or feet to lose."
5,Antec and a MacBook Pro,"My four year old MacBook Pro was chronically over heating. The Antec was an very inexpensive solution. This notebook cooler is now inseparable from my Mac, which has not overheated even once since purchasing this product. The Antec is lightweight and whisper quiet. The only minus is the small blue L.E.D. indicator light, which I feel is excessively bright."
5,Chill pad solved problem with computer shut downs.,"Bought this product after trying everything to fix my Acer laptop computer. It was running slowly, so I added more memory. It ran more quickly for a while and then started slowing down and shutting off several times a day. Always seemed to shut down when I was in the middle of a project! Getting the computer debugged, changing the start up, and other software repairs did not measurably improve the laptop's performance. In desperation, I bought the chill pad and my troubles were solved. A cooler computer runs better. Great product at a great price."
3,"Works well, but fragile","This cooling station does work very well at keeping laptops cool, but it breaks VERY easily - the cord is very fragile. The first time I thought I must have snagged it and not realized it, so I bought a replacement unit, and the cord eventually broke in a few months, when I was being downright anal about caring for it."
1,Works Great... until the cord stops working,"So my roommate and I both purchased this notebook cooler because it had great reviews. About three months in, the USB connecter stopped working for both of us. It only works unless I jiggle the USB cord endlessly, hold it in a certain position, move it around for a few seconds... but once it works and I let go, the blue light goes off and the fans turn off. I can't be expected to work on my laptop and hold the cord with one hand.And mind you, this is not due to a defective USB port on the computer - I own a MacBook and my roommate owns a Dell. We switched laptop coolers to see if it would work, but it doesn't. I'm not sure why the USB cord decided to malfunction all of a sudden."
3,"Does the job, but rubber parts are annoying","I enjoyed using the cooler for my laptop's overheating problem. But the rubber bits? They would never stay in. At. All.It got to the point where I just gave up this cooler, since the points allowed for better alleviation and air flow. I would recommend for its airflow, but not for its aesthetic appearance."
5,Great computer fan,I have been using this for a while now and it has been great. I really like that you can change the speed of the fan. I would gladly recommend this product to anyone
3,Check for cooling direction,While the Antec cooler is a very good product it does not serve every notebook computer equally. Before you buy this product ensure that your computer exhausts the hot air to the bottom of the computer. My computer's 5 fans suck air from the bottom and exhaust the heated air to the sides and rear. The Antec only limited the airflow rather than increasing it and resulted in a cooked CPU and motherboard. I still use it to raise the computer up off the desk but do not turn it on.
4,Keeps your lap cool too!,It works fine for what it is. They should have put a strap on it to hold onto your computer. I put my own large elastic. My husband dropped his and the tip of the connection broke immediately. It's nice that it runs off the usb.
1,Great...for about 6 months,"Loved the aluminum surface and variable speed option. Kept my Dell and my lap cool for about six months, then....nothing. Don't know if it's the cord or the mechanism; either way, the fans have stopped turning after a short amount of time with periodic use. It just doesn't last, so be wise & choose a different product."
3,Smells like ozone,"It does the job and my laptop (an HP Pavilion DV2000) is cooler, but there are a few disadvantages.1. It emits an ozone smell when operating.2. It's a little noisy.3. I can't use my high capacity battery because with that the laptop won't lie flat on the device. So when I want to use it on battery, I have to take out the old battery and put in the new, high capacity one. Inconvenient."
5,Simple and solid...,I was completely satisfied with this purchase....Keeps my laptop cool as a cucumber..also very easy to install and use..I have purchased two of them .....Both purchased were great....LDC
4,Not bad,"I had one of these before but the USB cable frayed. Not through a fault of the product more of my own mishandling. In fact I liked it so much that's why I bought it again. The price was pretty good. It's quiet and has a speed selection switch and seems to keep the laptop cool for my purposes. This new one has a bright blue LED that I don't remember having on my old one. I just face that side towards the wall, otherwise it is kind of distracting to others sitting on the couch if it faces the room. Overall a decent product."
4,Good cooler so far,"This is the first notebook cooler I have bought and it seems to be working good for the 2 months I have had it. It is quiet and fits under my 17"" notebook. I have had my notebook for 2 years and it never occurred to me to buy a cooler before. After researching several brands and models I chose to buy this one based on user reviews and various editorial reviews found at CNET and computer magazines."
5,Using it with my gaming system,"I was having problems with my PS3 overheating so I went shopping. I was looking for the cooler that attched to the side of the PS3 as it matched and I figured it wouldnt really be noticed. I was not able to find it locally and I was told there had been a few instances of the PS3 & cooler getting hot enough the two would get stuck together. Hmmm I thought thats probably not true. Anyhow, I didnt want to wait to order soemthing on-line and found one of these locally.Bottom line is I havent had an overheating problem since I started using this two months ago. I just leave it plugged into the PS3 so its always on when I use the system. It fits nicely under the PS3 and is barely visible in my TV stand. I do think the blue light is annoying but when your focused on playing a game or watching a movie you dont even notice the blue glow on the side."
4,Recommended,"I have had this laptop cooler for several months now and have been very happy with it. Some people complain about the blue power light, but it doesn't bother me at all. I also like that it has both low and high settings. I keep it on high while playing games, and although it makes a little more noise it keeps my computer cooler. When I'm just browsing I keep it on low and I don't even hear the fans. Probably the best thing about this cooler is that it works very well both on a desk or table and while sitting on my lap. I even bought one for my roommate for Christmas because he liked mine so much. One thing to keep in mind is that it won't work as well for smaller laptops. I have an older 13"" Macbook and it is just barely big enough. Also, unlike most other coolers (I think) it sucks air down away from laptop instead of blowing air up into it."
3,.,"This cooler does it job, I noticed a significant difference in the warmth of my laptop. It's blue light doesn't really bother me, and the sound of the fans are tolerable. However, after a few months of use, I find that the power cord doesn't work too well. The cord has to be pressed a certain way for it to stay on. VERY ANNOYING. Especially since I can't really tell whether it is on, with my laptop humming as well. Then the laptop overheats and crashes."
5,"Great cooler, a must have for any one with a laptop","This cooler is awesome, it does exactly what it says. It keeps my laptop cool and it matches with it so it makes it even look cool lol. I love this thing if your looking for a good cooler then this is it.....why are you still reading? BUY IT!!!.....DO IT NOW BEFORE THEY'RE ALL GONE!!!!"
2,"Good for cooling, Bad for battery","After the first time I used this cooler my laptop battery was completely drained and now no longer holds a charge. This could've been a coincidence, but this is the SECOND battery that this cooler has destroyed. I now have to continuously charge the battery for it to hold any kind of charge. I can barely use the laptop for more than 2hours without having to charge it again. I hope the manufacturer finds some kind of solution to this, because the cooler is really good and useful except for destroying the battery life. It is pretty bulky for anything other than keeping it on the desk, but it really does cool your laptop. There are two speeds, and the noise is pretty minimal, more like white noise, but its not too bothersome, just turn up the volume if you're watching a movie. The USB cord is designed to plug into the left side of the laptop, but if your laptop is like mine, with all USB's on the RIGHT side, it will reach to the right side."
4,Sturdy Cooler,"I've had this cooler for a few years and it has functioned pretty well. You don't get much air flow on low, but it is quiet. HI is louder, but not bothersome, sucking air from the top's two fans and out the sides.The only complaint I have is with the power cord. The cord attaching at the USB connector has come partly detached and pulled away and the connector attaching to the cooler sometimes makes connection sometimes not. All-in-all I think I got my money's worth. I wish I could purchase the power cord separately."
1,Dead after about 3 months,It looks like nice and I trusted the Antec name but one of the fans died after about 3 months. I can not recommend this. The warranty is 3 years but it does not cover shipping so in the end it's too expensive to deal with getting it repaired/replaced
2,Didn't last very long,"This unit stopped working within 4 months of purchase. While I had it, it was cooling my Dell Latitude D620 laptop fairly well. Then one day it just stopped working. I thought maybe the problem was with the USB cord, and sure enough it was. When I held the cord in a ""certain way"", on the cooler end, the fans would start up. Occasionally it even stayed on after I let go of the cord, and was very careful not to joggle the cord. Needless to say, this was hardly practical in the long run.I wonder if any of these devices are designed to last very long. It didn't cost much, so I am only somewhat upset. I need to buy another one soon. And keep my fingers crossed that it lasts longer than the previous one."
3,A great idea that could be executed a little better...,"I got this from Buy.com when it was one sale and had a rebate. The Antec USB cooler does serve a very legitimate purpose: heat is a brutal enemy to laptop users everywhere -- especially if you like to use them around soft-top surfaces like bed mattresses or sofa cushions. This cooler will allow you to set it on any surface without worry it will overheat.However, with extended use, I've found that the cord can wear quite easily, and more often than not, the USB power cord stops powering the cooler unless it is positioned exactly right (it worked perfectly about four months or so before doing this). And while some reviewers have praised the Antec Cooler's blue neon light, my friends and I have found that it is much too bright as a signal that it is running; it can light up a dark room quite easily.This product is something good to have, and it definitely outclasses some of the competition, but I wouldn't spend over $20 for it."
2,Do not buy for use with MacBook Pro,"I bought a Targus Chillmat for my MacBook pro, it worked great, so I figured, I would buy a second notebook cooler for the office. Antec came to mind, because of the good reviews and the stylish design. So I bought one. I was very disappointed!Pros:* Looks good, nice cable storage, usb passthrough* Fits nicely under my MacBook ProCons:* Does not cool my MacBook Pro nearly as much as the Targus Chillmat! I'm talking orders of magnitude here... I think the fans just aren't in the right places to chill the hot spots on my MacBook. I have tried moving it around, but really doesn't help much.* Louder than my Targus Chillmat, even when on 'low' setting.* No 'on/off' switch, only 'low' and 'high' setting toggle. Means you have to unplug it to turn it off."
4,"Good for some, Bad for some","I have a Dell Inspiron Notebook and a Sony Vaio PCG-GRZ630 notebook.It works great for Dell product since the processor is located on the middle of the notebook, where it's most warm. The fan is located on the bottom so when a cool air is blown at it, it cools off the notebook very quickly.With Sony, however, the fan is located on the side which does not meet the fan of the cooler. It does nothing but blow warm air by the time this unit is on.To make my point short: if you are using a more up-to-date computer, it will help. However, for Sony, HP (My friend tried and it didn't help his notebook either) it's better to use one of those personal fans that little girls like carrying around.The location of the notebook on the cooler is sensitive as well. Two fans are in the middle, so if you can locate the warmest part, it will help.It's USB 1.1 and 2.0 compatible, with a on/off switch is convinient. No power-outlet is necessary.Overall, good gadget, but not a necessity"
2,Not for the macbook air:/,"i was really hoping that this product would work, but for my macbook air, it made my CPU temps rise by a couple degrees C.the problem is that it expels air away from the laptop but this theory doest work for macs (or at least the macbook air) so i had to return it. the construction was solid and i liked the aluminum top, too bad it didn't work as expected"
3,Antec Cooler,"Item arrived well packaged, BUT on each of the TOP four corners, there should have been small rubber pieces to cushion the laptop and provide noise reduction...there were NO small rubber pieces. As I was replacing an existing unit, I used the pieces I had on this unit. Without instructions or prior knowledge, this unit would have been noisy and UN-USABLE. This unit was NOT new, so this is clearly a situation of BUYER-BE-AWARE."
2,Great if you like replacing stuff...,"I purchased a replacement for my original antec cooler after the connection kept failing. i had assumed this was due to my own errors of kind of haphazardly setting my laptop down without paying attention to how it was sitting on the usb cord. i bought a replacement about 6 months ago and this time, i paid very close attention to how i was setting my laptop down on the floor or wherever...and the cord's connection has failed again. it will randomly shut off, even while sitting on a desk without any movement on the laptop. i will be buying another cooling pad, NOT another one of these."
4,Excellent cooler,"Good solid portable cooler, better if it handled 17"" laptops, miss the USB pass through .... ................. ............ .. ,,"
4,MacBook Pro Users - Be Aware,"MBP users should know that while this product is a perfect size for the 15"" model and it definitely keeps your laptop cooler, there is an issue. The design of the USB connection has the cord attached at the back. In order to make sure that it doesn't block your power connection, you must bend the USB cord waaay down. There is still danger of your power connection not being completely in contact as it should be. Also, with the short length of the coolpad's USB power connector, there isn't an option to plug it in on the other side of your MBP.O, and if you plan to use this on your lap, look first at the contours of the bottom. Although the large feet make a great base on a hard surface, you may want to use a lapboard or something similar between the plastic edges of the bottom surface and your legs.Even with the minor issues (after fiddling with it a bit and getting things settled in) I am very happy with this product. It does the trick with my MBP, even when I play WoW."
3,Not too bad but durability issue,"I had this cooler for over a year and everything is satisfactory except for the USB connection to the laptop.After certain period, the wires get bent and the connection get hairy. I'm using it now all taped up..."
3,I had it for a year and had to buy another one,I had this product for one year and it was done. I noticed I didn't use the rubber things you insert in each corner to give space between the laptop and the cooling fan. I am not sure if that is why it stopped working on me. I got one for my aunt and another one for myself. Let's see how it works now.Also the rubber things fall out easily and I now (only a few months later) only have 2 left.Time will tell...
1,Disappointment,"I just received my cooler just three days ago and from day one, the port for the USB cable doesn't work correctly. I have to readjust my cable from time to time for the cooler to ""work"" (from previous experience with other coolers, its only an early sign that the port will die completely). And when it does ""work"", the fans have no affect on my laptop's temperature whatsoever."
2,not for lap use,This cooling pad works perfect on the table top. You can not keep it on the lap as it does not have any cushion material on the back and the cable keeps coming off. The length of the cable is so short that it hardly reaches the usb ports on my inspiron 6000.It is designed only for max 15 inch laptops.
5,Great,"My laptop gets hot at the front and the back, and this has managed to keep my laptop extremely cool."
4,"Does what it's supposed to, but I have some design ideas","My husband and I both use these with our laptops. This notebook cooler does a great job of keeping our HP Pavilion notebooks running very cool while conveniently not requiring a wall outlet for power. It's powered through the piggyback USB cable included, so you won't lose any usb jacks on your laptop. This cooler seems most ideal for a 15"" laptop, although I use it for my 17"" laptop without any problems at all. What I'd like to see however is for Antec to make a custom stand for this that will lift the notebook up to monitor height if you are using your notebook with an external keyboard and mouse. I like this design:Xbrand XB-1001 360 Height Adjustable Laptop Stand, but I find that all of the stands I like don't have built in notebook coolers, and I don't feel comfortable with the stability of putting a notebook cooler and then a notebook on the stand."
3,Objects are smaller than they appear,"I have a 17"" screen Toshiba Satellite laptop that LOVES to shut itself off from the heat. I figured the dimensions of this chillpad would be adequate (the base of the laptop is 16.5 x 11.5)...not even close. The chill pad is 16 inches.....diagonally. Actual dimensions end up: 13""L x 11""W. It fits perfectly for my older 15"" laptop. Also, my desk is a fold-down smooth-wood surface so the skids don't stay put too well, but normal surfaces should be fine. I also have the fans which suck up air on the underside of my 17"" laptop so I don't know if this would've impeded the air flow in the wrong direction. Just to let other ppl know out there who have the same Toshiba I do, it won't fit. I currently just have my laptop up on stilts (that is, 4 piles of CD cases!)"
2,"Bad design, terrible for big laptops, broke quickly","I'll keep this short and bitter. I have a 17"" laptop (Gateway 7811) that I play games on. Wanted something not too bulky to sit between the laptop and my lap and provide some additional cooling.This thing is a little too small for a laptop of this size but doesn't do too badly. The #1 main issue is the terrible USB plug design. The power plug piece broke due to cord placement. Overall, when working, it provided a very small amount of cooling (about 4-5 degrees according to speedfan). The inability to turn off the super bright blue LED, the cord storage panel on the bottom popping off frequently, and the overall cheap quality of design/materials all contributed to me hating this thing. But the terrible USB power plug design was really the main issue. That plug will snap or break, it's only a matter of time."
5,For owners of the XBOX 360,"Anybody who owns an XBOX 360 knows that those systems get hot quite fast, especially the older units. With this Notebook Cooler my XBOX 360 never gets hot. It's so nice that I may buy one for my Notebook PC."
5,It works !,"I had the over heating problem with my DELL INSPIRON laptop for the last one month, it turns off when it is over heated.I just bought this product from amazon a week ago(05/27/2008) and yes, it works, it exactly does what it is designed for,silently - cools the back laptop(dissipates all the heat)Yet to see the effectiveness in a long run.For now, i like it, it works."
2,Not worth it,"Well it lasted only 2 weeks before the USB cable wire started shorting out on me. I have to keep repositioning the cable for it to power up, very annoying. Did cool better than the Targus I bought at Wal-Mart however."
4,works well,"Have used one for over a year. Bought this one as a gift. Effectively cools notebook. Given only four stars because USB connector is bulky enough to block both USB ports on Dell 5150 notebook. Fortunately, the Antec USB connector provides an additional port."
2,Worked great for the first 2 months then started making noises,"I was very happy with this cooler at first. It kept my laptop runner cool as a cucumber. Some people have noted problems with the feet that elevate the notebook, but I've had no such issues there. I am though not happy with the very bright blue light that stays on when its in use. It's very noticeable and annoying to me. I ended up using a small piece of black duck tape to cover the light which has worked well, except that now theres a piece of duck tape on an otherwise aesthetically pleasing device.Now the big problem. After only having it for less than 2 months it has started making this horrible vibrating noise. It's as if the fans are not balanced or something. But whatever the case, it's a major killing point to what was a great item. I'll be returning to it amazon."
2,You get what you pay for!,"Cheap price cheap item, little rubber stoppers keep falling out all the time it is hard to move your laptop using this item, as for the cooling part it works, it is just very unconvienent to store and use!"
4,seems to help,"Seems to help.pros = easily handles 17 inch laptop, relatively quiet, now comes with rubber spacers so laptop sits 1/2 inch above cooler.cons = flimsy"
4,Works great!,"This cooler has become my laptop's second skin. Goes with the laptop everywhere, even on my lap!Yes, when the room is absolutely quiet you can hear the fan, but I have come to ignore it now. And the blue light from the left hardly comes in my way. For the purpose it serves, I think it works absolutely fine.My laptop is way cool now as compared to earlier. Definitely a good purchase."
5,Great buy,"Product is as mentioned on the description, customer service for Antec should get 5 star as well. Product works great and very quiet, great when sitting in your bed and working, it keeps your laptop from getting super hot. The only issue, that I would like to mention is that the rubber pointers where the laptop rests, fall off very easily, however may be thats a fairly easy fix. Overall the product is as what they mentioned in the discription."
2,Buy a better one,"Bought this late 2009, first day of use power supply socket is/was loose or faulty and have to hold wire from USB port at a certain angle for cooler to work.Fortunately i don't use it much, product doesn't drop temps much either, i would recommend a different product."
1,DO NOT BUY - - A COMPLETE WASTE!,"After purchasing a cheap cooling pad by Targus, and having it short out on me, I was recommended this Antec pad by a friend. Well surprise! Antec's construction quality is complete CRAP too. After a few months the same thing happened, the cord that plugs from the USB port to the pad shorts out. The only nice thing is that you actually know Antec is broken because the annoying blue light goes away, and if you have patience and are skilled at typing one-handed, you can fiddle with the cord until you get it just right and hold it so that the blue light doesn't go away, so you know the fans are on. I am so tired of this game, I just want a company who will make a product that lasts, instead of ripping us off with their cheap crap."
2,"Had two, both broke in months","I first bought one of these because my boyfriend's original cooler mat broke (cord got ripped out by our dog) and was so impressed I bought another for myself.The traction bumps are constantly falling out (and consequently got lost) and both our mats broke within a few months. The cords both failed for different reasons.Initially I loved how effective and quiet the mat was, but because two of them broke so fast I cannot recommend this to anyone."
3,ciiling is good,it's really good for the cooling thing .. but when it comes to standing the laptop on it it's not that good at all ..i recommend something else..
1,Worst crappy laptop cooler,"This is by far the crappiest laptop cooler I've ever used. I went through 3 of these, and they all broke down the same way. I only bought them 3 times because they were on sale, and I regret buying them. It works out fine at first, but you start to hear a really annoying clicking noise and soon it becomes an all time clicking whirling clunking noise like a mechanical room. It is SO loud and so annoying I can't keep it on anymore. And I went through three of these..... I should've just bought a more expensive much better cooler with what I wasted on three of these. DON;T BUY becaue it'll break down in no time and you'll start hearing the annoying noise. I even tried to take it apart to see what was causing the noise but it's so tightly put together there is no way of taking apart without destroying it completely. what a piece of junk....."
4,Notebook Cooler,"This product really does work!! I was having a terrible time keeping by 12"" Averatec notebook from overheating. the notebook has not overheated since using this product."
5,This chill mat rocks!,"I needed to buy something that would keep the processor on my laptop cool when my son plays a particular computer game. I bought this one and honestly, did not have very high hopes for the results. I am happy to report that the results that I got with this chill mat are extremely good. My laptop runs nice and cool, even after prolonged computer game playing. I would highly recommend this product to anyone needing something to cool the running temperature of their laptop."
4,Cooler works great but....,I did alot of research before buying my coolers. One of my coolers is one made of an aluminum base with 3 fans and sits at an angle. It works great but it is just not portable--to put on your lap. So I started looking for something else and I found the Antec. Read all the reviews and decided it could be held on my lap. The only problem is that I have a large 17 inch laptop. The laptop hangs over the Antec and that means the rubber feet on the bottom of the computer are not able to raise it above the cooler. It sits flush--no air flow. I remedied the problem by putting 4 rubber feet (that I bought at Home Depot) sticking then on the Antec. Now there is a 3/4 inch clearance between the computer and the Antec. Great airflow and the Antec Cooler does its job superbly. I would have given it 5 stars except for the issue of it fitting on my computer but I fixed that problem by attatching the feet to the Antec. Well worth the money!!
2,what JUNK!,"I've a 17"" custom made laptop. Is this even supposed to keep my laptop cooler? Cause it certainly isn't doing that job! It's very loud, and it just blows very little HOT air into it. My laptop is as hot as it was before I purchased this.What a waste of money! Oh, and did I mention LOUD?!!!"
5,5stars,"I got what i want with this item, I purchase it cuz my laptop turns hot... And this cooler refresh my laptop in a very good way...The only complaint is the blue light is very very shine! I simple put a little tape on it...Im very happy with this item"
1,Was great for two months,"The fan is great in its design but not so great in its longevity. After only two months, the cooling pad is already starting to make death sounds. Within a week, I'm sure I'll be back on Amazon.com trying to find a replacement. Perhaps it's just this unit.If it weren't for the short life, I'd give the pad a 4 out of 5 stars. The blue light it emits while plugged in is extremely bright and annoying, and there is no ""off"" setting or switch - you have to unplug it when you don't want to have it on). The size and shape, though, are great. I could use either laptop - a large and small one - without worrying about whether the fan could cool it or hold it comfortably."
3,Quality decreases over time,"The Antec notebook cooler looks cool and has good cooling ability.Over a period of four years, the quality has declined.The low/high switch no longer works.The fan starts out very loud and quiets down after a few minutes. Sometimes it gets extremely loud and annoying so I'll have to unplug it.The blue light is very bright and I cover it.The USB cord feels cheap.You'll need to use compressed air to dust it monthly to reduce the noise."
2,"this notebook cooler works good two weeks that they give me start trouble to me , sometime fan is not working totaly dead","notebook fan is working two weeks o.k and after two week fan give me a trouble , sometime its work and sometime is total dead, i am buying online, so i have no idea about warranty , some body want to buy this item go to any local store they give me a warranty , its a better"
1,Disapointed! Should of listened to other revews and not bought.,"It seemed packaged very well and worked good when I originally got it. After a few days I realized one of the fans wasn't working. Returned it and got a new one. This one worked for about a month and then the usb cord that hooks the fan to the laptop to give it power stopped staying in. I was too busy with school to return it to Amazon but I wrote to the company about 6 months later, still within the 1 year warranty. They want ME to pay for a box to put it in and shipping to have it sent to them so they can ""fix"" it. NOT WORTH IT. The other problem is the fans get covered in dust fast and there is no easy way to clean them, unless you want to sit there for a few hours with a toothpick."
4,best fan i could find for my needs,"After trying several fans i had to settle for the antec fan again. Yes again. my first one worked for about 9 months and then had a problem with the connection to the body of the fan from the body of the lap top. but when it works it works, compare it to the more expensive super fans out there and i did, this one works better. It keeps my 17 inch cooler then they did. i dont know why but it does. i will not remove the plug from the fan, instead i will remove the usb part from the lap top when i need to take the fan off so i dont put any strain on the plug, now that i know how sensitive it is. but it works well and i would recommend it except for that tiny flaw. but they ALL have flaws. its also very loud and i know that bothers some of you. i usually can ignore it. but loud it is."
2,AVOID!,Cord connecting the cooler and laptop broke within 3 weeks of use. Loved the design of the product and it acutally cooled my computer very well. However a broken piece of equipment isnt going to do me any good. Avoid this product even though it looks very nice. Dont be fooled people!
4,Does The Job,"I own a Macbook that tends to get very hot with prolonged use so I've bought enough laptop coolers to know that this is the best one in its price range. Sure, it would probably get beaten by $60 laptop coolers, but for a third of the cost, it really does do its job. This will be the second one I've purchased -- only because in the process of moving, I lost the little USB cord that you need for it to operate with your laptop."
2,Wiggling the wire....,I ordered the product and when did it stop working? Day 31 at 2AM. The wire is kind of cheap and now it has to be held in a certain position to even work so it does not help when I need it for school.... I am now looking for something else. My boyfriends is working fine but his laptop really never moves so I would only suggest this for someone who isn't as mobile with their laptop as I am.
3,Not for macbooks,"I bought this for my 13 inch macbook and its cooling ability is almost non existent. It did little to nothing for the temperature of my laptop. I would not recommend this for any laptop without vents on the bottom. I would however highly recommend it for any laptop with vents on the bottom due to the fact that it sucks air away from the laptop. It looks awesome and I like the variable modes, construction seems to be solid but because it did not cool my laptop it only gets 3 stars. Only recommended for laptops with vents on the bottom."
4,Better Safe Than Sorry!,"I wanted a cooling device for my Dell notebook. I trust Antec. When it came time to build my desktop, I chose Antec for the case and the power supply-quality, quality all the way down the line! Back to the cooler. When I saw that Antec made a Notebook cooler, I put my money on the table immediately. Why? Because this is a company that takes pride in the products it designs and builds. A three year warranty is also a sign that the company is confident in the product. Yes, it costs more than the other coolers, but it's an Antec product. If you are concerned about your notebook overheating (who isn't), buy a cooler to protect your investment.In my humble opinion, the Antec cooler was the only choice!"
1,Don't waste your money,"I purchased this for around 35 bucks at a CompUSA closing sale. It is lightweight, but the fans are kinda loud. One of the fans failed after about 6 months and the other one makes a sound like its dying ever so often."
1,An absolutely terrible book,This book is common sense. It had very few things that a junior in high school wouldn't know. The author keeps removing this book from its current page and creating a new book when people who buy it leave bad reviews. A completely garbage book.
1,126 pages of ego that will not help,"This book was a disappointment. It contained very simple tips that were ridiculously over explained. It spent very little time providing the reader with any substantial assistance. Instead the writer delivered common things the reader should do, such as don't drink to much alcohol or make sure and consume creatine. I also found it very narcissistic. Kennedy used 126 pages to say ""I'm better than you because college was easy for me."" This is then concluded by a list of grammatical errors made in writing and in speech that he found personally annoying. [...]. Good luck ~Bryan"
5,Valet Tray serves its purpose,"I like the color of the wood and it holds everything I need it to hold attractively. Now my wallet, keys, and such are not scattered all over my dresser."
4,I will never forget this book..,"Maybe because I listened to an unabridged audio version of this book, read in the authors own voice, I have a kinder view of the rather flat, unadorned, almost childlike, journalistic style that has drawn criticism... I found the author's direct, repetitive, style soothing and comforting and almost necessary, just for me to be able to endure the hideious reality of the narritive. I am going to buy this book, keep it, and refer to it everytime I think I am having a bad day. For some reviewers to criticize this woman for reaching out and choosing the wrong relationships is appaling. This book is a tribute to the will to survive, the power of love and the human capacity for forgiveness."
1,puhleeze,"I'm sure that any telemarketer would love to have a list of this book's fans, since they are clearly a very trusting bunch.Do they really believe that Ms Kim flew by Korean Airlines years before Korean Airlines was founded? Do they really think she watched ""The Elephant Man"" on TV with her husband years before the movie was released in theaters? Do they really believe she farmed rice in mid-winter (at the age of five!), and lived on a heated earth floor, and learned English in two days? Do they really believe she skipped a few years of school and still graduated at age 17?Don't they wonder at how neatly - and implausibly - the book's central event manages to combine the two most important issues of international feminism in the past decade: genital mutilation and honor killings?Most importantly, don't they realize why Doubleday still hasn't issued the book in paperback?"
2,Fictious book,"Elizabeth Kim should check her facts before deciding to write a book about the injustice in Korea. Yes, she may have suffered a great deal, but to fabricate and exaggerate what happened to her for the sake of sympathy is not accepatble. There is no such thing as ""honor killing"" in Korea and the author has spread this and many false rumors about Korea without checking what really happened. Also, her negative attitude towards life is depressing as she blames others for her misfortune in life in the past and present. A careful study of this book would reveal many contradictions; therefore, this book should be read as fiction."
1,A very doubtful memoir,"The book has a very intense beginning. I was astonished by what the author witnessed at a very young age. However, as I read on, I felt the book lack of any solid information that could supplement her claims/experiences. Not that I don't believe what she has been through, I just find it hard to believe that anybody can pick up a foreign language within a few days. Without any supporting references, I find the book extremely weak and consider it more or less a novel than a memoir.Lastly, given the author is a journalist, I am very disappointed by the author's story telling ability. It seems that the author devoted all the energy in writing the first few chapters which were the best parts of the book."
1,well crafted fiction,"Well, what can I say? This is a very well done piece of fiction that appeals to very sympathetic people who are possibly familiar with the kind of situation depicted in this story. Anybody who has lived in Korea during the same time period would think that the author is talking about some very foreign country. Publishing this book is akin to submitting a falsified resume. It's frustrating to find that this kind of work is possible in the world where Korea is very little known."
1,No Comment,"I am a ""naive"", caring person and this book made me weep! To read about a child who sees her mother getting killed by her uncle and grandfather then later being adopted by ""Cruel"" religious parents - depressed me a great deal. But as I kept reading the book I was suspecting the writer's honesty! Especially when in page 101 she refers to the mother of her adopted mother as ""How could anyone love that withered, malevolent old hag?"". Automatically, once I've read that line I re-visited the holly Amazon.com and read a couple of reviews and in there I've found a lot of people who contradicted everything this pathological liar said in her ""Ten thousand sorrows"" book, and who calls herself a victim.I knew about the term ""Too good to be true"" but only after I've lost about two hours of my life in this ""book"" I got to know that there must be a term ""Too horrible to be true"" too.Nice one ""Doubleday""! We'll see how am I going to buy your books from now on."
1,a little hard to swallow,"I just want to say that like Jemma I also found the hyperbole troublesome. For example, when Kim's husband throws the casserole out the closed window on their first night together. (Later she describes him as a compulsive neatness freak - just the kind of guy who would ruin a window just because he doesn't like zucchini!?) Kim says that the patio was covered in shards of glass, so her hands and knees were ""ribboned with cuts"" from cleaning up the mess. Hello? Never hear of a broom and dustpan? Who gets down on her hands and knees in a pile of broken glass? Certainly no one I'm interested in sympathizing with."
1,I've already read Angela's Ashes... next book please!,"Once you've read one sob story, you've read them all. Too many adjectives... not enough action to what she did with her experiences in her earlier years. I may be biased, but I'm tired of Korean, or pseudo-Korean writers writing about the same drab topics. From sex slaves to over-bearing parents... can Koreans write something more about universal topics in North America in lieu of the ""Korean Experience"", which has been played out to the hilt by so many writers before her? But I do give the author credit for not using the words ""Rice"", ""Kimchee"", or any other words that define Koreans as ugh, the white man sees us, in her book title. Hi Jewel."
4,A very moving story about courage and triumph over adversity,"I spent the better part of yesterday evening reading the book cover to cover. This story is such a moving drama..all of it true. Kim writes with such eloquence...she is both tender and objective, which is remarkable for a person who has faced so much struggle in her short lifetime. I gave it 4 stars as I felt that the story was a bit disjointed (especially toward the end). Otherwise, I highly recommend it but be prepared with a hankie as the tears will surely flow!"
5,Great book!,"This was an excellent book! I could not put it down. It isa sad story, but I really enjoyed the book. I read the reviewthat says that honor killings do not happen in Korea -I have a friend who comes from Korea who said honorkillings do happen but they are kept secret (often labeledas a suicide). I hope the reviewer who thinks he knows allabout the korean culture opens his mind a bit rather thanrejecting something so quickly."
5,Great Price,I was looking for a 1.8 in drive and came across this one and was completely surprised by the price. Dell charges more than double the price. Great company.
4,"good drive, but BE CAREFUL CHOOSING!!!","BUYER BEWARE - This page does not clearly specify the model of the drive. If you look at the individual seller options some comments will specify different model numbers. I thought I was ordering an MK6006GAH, but instead received an MK6008GAH, which has a completely different interface. It won't work in my laptop.The MK6006GAH uses an ATA/50pin interface (like the one in the picture), whereas the MK6008GAH uses a ZIF connector.Ironically, I already had an MK6008GAH from an old broken iPod, which I put into an external USB enclosure and it works great. Thus my 4-star rating... if you can actually get the drive you area looking for, it's a great little gadget."
4,It works what can you say.,"I bought this as a preventative maintenance item for my laptop. Everyone else at work had the same vintage laptop and many drives were failing.I swapped the drives, ghosted the old one, and am up and running."
4,Mini-harddrive,"This is a hard to find item for special mini-notebooks. This worked easily out of the box. Was difficult to install, but persistence paid off in the end."
1,wrong model,"for this shop,they send to me wrong models, and I am providing the return to them - I have already contacted the seller and he send me the instruction to send back"
1,I'm just doing this to get 50 bucks,I've never read the bible. I never will. there are far better fictional stories out there.
1,Defective Swimsuit,"I ordered this for a trip and it arrived in time however, the most noticable gromet was loose. I tried to fix it but that was not possible. due to the cost I did not return."
2,Pop-up Book of M.C. Escher,"I bought this book to use in my third grader's study of M.C. Escher and tessellations. The pictures that make up the pop-ups are too small to use with a group and might be even too small and non-vibrant for children at all. The narration was adult-like. For adult Escher fans this is probably good, but for children, who adore pop-up books, it was a disappointment."
5,IF YOU LIKE GOTHIC ETC... YOU SHOULD LIKE THIS,"This CD is really amazing, it is a compilation of a number of relatively unknown artists who deserve exposure. While not every song is wonderful the CD ,as a whole, is. The gothic genre it is hard to explain because it encompasses many different types of bands and sounds. Some songs are more ""ethereal"" while others are more hard-edged, so there is something for every taste. It is a treat to listen to because each song is original; it isn't victim to the pitfall that many single band CDs are, that is, no song sounds much like any of the others on the CD."
4,Had to mention Matrix,"my review was mainly to point out a great song on disc 2 that failed to get mentioned previously. while the rest mentioned are good, i find the best song to be Matrix's Dreams are Real. I have since searched for other music by this band. It is compilations like this that make great bands like Matrix rise to the occasion."
5,The Sisterhood Kicks Ass,"This Graphic Novel continues the story that began with the 8-issue mini-series from Epic Comics. At the end of that storyline, Boronwe had become a full-fledged warrior-sister within the Sisterhood and been sent into her first battles. Along the way, she managed to make an enemy of Vandalis, the powerful Princess of Swords, part of the ruling triumvirate.Vandalis arranged to have Boronwe put on trial for treason, but it didn't turn out as planned. Borowne was set free and a new Queen has taken control of the Sisterhood.In this GN, Boronwe is faced with a choice -- to take her chances as an ordinary warrior under the command of Vandalis, or to join the secretive and lethal Daughters of Death.Illustrated by the late Australian artist, Peter Ledger.For more details on this series, please visit: www.christymarx.com/ledger/sos.htm"
5,a must for any serious punk fan!,"This CD rocks! There isn't a single bad song on this cd. I usually get bored of cd's fast but this one never gets irritating! Also, if you like goldfinger, check out Blink 182. BUY THIS CD!!!"
1,Umm...am I crazy or something?,"I could be insane, but there isn't a single song on this cd I think is even remotely decent. I like Hang-Ups A LOT, so I went out and bought this cd (I got it in the bargain bin for 7 dollars). I listened to it once. I subconsiously intentionally lost it. Respond to skapiunk@aol.com"
4,old school,"I used to own this CD back in high school, recently purchased it because I just couldn't get the songs out of my head, even after all these years. I don't regret my purchase at all. I wish punk like this was still made."
4,Over-rated,"This is a good Goldfinger album, but the worst out of their full length albums. I think Hang-ups and Stomping ground are much better. Stand out songs on here are: ""here in you bedroom,"" ""Miles Away,"" and of course ""mable."""
5,Goldfinger is a great band! This CD was the greatest thing!,"Goldfinger is the best! My favorite songs on there are Mable,Answers,Anxiety,and Pictures. My boyfriend got me into that kind of music, and I cant stop listening to it! I purchesed The Goldfinger Cd-Goldfinger, and Its my favorite cd out of all 162! Goldfinger is great!!!!!!"
3,You like Goldfinger? Check out Home Grown.,"Not a bad album, but not a landmark to my ears. Some pretty cool songs, but others are sort of annoying...just my opinion. Trust me, check out Home Grown if you love Punk with Ska influences."
3,Best textbook I have this semester,"I disagree with the other review of this book. The she/her thing is not distracting at all. Compared to my Torts/Property books, this book is very well laid-out. There is plenty of text in between cases to explain the concepts. The main thing I don't like is that some of the cases they include are not on-point except for in dicta. Seems like they should have been able to find better cases that were more on-point. I think this book is also weak on its (jumbled) explanation of damages. Otherwise, I really like it."
2,"Book arrived in great time, but quality of book lower than expected","The book arrived in the amount of time specified, but the quality of the book is less than ""good."" After owning this book for no less than a week, I noticed that the back spine is separated...I don't think I will be able to re-sell this book because it is not holding up very well. There are not very many markings in the book, which is a plus, but the overall quality is a little disappointing."
3,This book misses the whole picture,"This book is well organized and the writing is quite clear. However, as previously stated, I felt the authors could have used cases more on point with some of the topics. Many times the author would explain a topic, however, the case used to illustrate that topic would not thoroughly analyze it or analyze another closely-related topic instead. I would have preferred more on point cases and greater information on the UCC.I do not understand the other reviewer who expressed frustration regarding the use of feminine pronouns as that is something that is common place in legal scholarship."
5,Book arrived as described!,Book arrrived as described and seller shipped quickly. Will do business with this seller again!
1,You get what you paid for,"I bought 2 sets of these for my 2003 S10 ZR2 with factory flares. From the pictures and description, it look promising and a great value. However when I received them I was severely disappointed. Basically made up of a thin hard cheap plastic, I thought I might try to at least see what they look like on my truck but they don't even fit!DOES NOT FIT FACTORY FLARES, even though the description says it will fit factory flares. Do not be mistaken, they do not. And since I opened the packaging to see what they would look like on the truck I cannot return.Don't even bother, a waste of money, as the saying goes... you get what you paid for."
4,Brief Review of L.A.,"A nice, concise guide for L.A. Hits the highlights of L.A. and surrounding areas but does not review the more unique aspects. Restaurant section is okay."
3,"JUNONIA.com has 1X - 6X sizes in black, white, ivory.","Being a plus size woman allergic to elastic, it's hard to find panties that have elastic covered legs and waistband.If you need larger plus sizes than Jockey offers, check out the Comfort Edge French Cut Brief at Junonia.com"
1,Buyer beware--NOT PLUS SIZE,"These underwear are not what I ordered. Nowhere on the package does it say ""Plus size"" or Grande or whatever designation Jockey is using these days to designate underwear sized for curvier derrieres. Even in smaller sizes like 6, the Grande/Plus underwear fits me better, and what I got from this seller ain't that.So, buyer beware when buying from this seller. You may not get what you think you ordered."
2,Less than average quality,"I thought by ordering Jockey I would avoid the generally poor quality of underwear that seems to be in the marketplace these days. Jockey is no better than the rest. The individual panties are not cut the same despite being marked the same size in a 3 pack, and they run small to size and do not provide correct coverage as a French cut."
5,Subtle tragedy of love (and life),"Chaucer's narrative mastery is more subtlely envidenced here than in the Canterbury Tales, but mastery it is. This poem is a wry but kindly perspective on the vigor and impetuosity of young love. The closest analogy is Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet. A singular work. Well worth your time"
5,Read!,"Look, ... i love snoop dogg! i love rap (westcoast foe life) so these guys must be really famous and u know why because they make pretty good! u must buy this movie if u a snoop fan! its all about..., and about snoop running a casino, im only 14 years old and its not offenseve at all,its a good interesting movie with entertainment to serve (sorry for bad spelling)any way just bye it and u won't regret it!..."
2,HIP-HOP CASINO,"This movie (and I use the term movie loosely since it's only 30 min. long) is pretty bad. Snoop Dogg plays a big time gambler who opens up a casino of his own with the help of the mob. Eventually complications arise and the mob is after him. The film is amazing in appearance as far as the characters dress and background scenery goes. However, there is no other real subtance to the film. The best part is after the film is over and two music videos are played. The second of the two videos is great (lots of nudity and the song is pretty cool to). None the less, if you want to see Snoop Dogg at his best, check out MURDER WAS THE CASE. Or if you just like movies of this type (short movie/music video) see STREETZ IS WATCHING (Only the uncensored version) starring rapper Jay-Z."
1,BITES..HARD HORE!!!,"I dont know why he wastes our time with his ""music"". He aint got no talent. That boy needs some help."
5,"I,TS ALL ABOUT SNOOP DOGGY DOGG!",I think that Snoop Dogg Is A very good actor because he has a lot of good sounds like B PLEASE
2,Nothing to Laugh At -,"This is a forced comedy with nothing to laugh at. The premise is funny and that is about it. I was hoping for belly laughs but hardly smiled. It was sort of ""Odd Couple"" mixed with a male duo ""Thelma and Louise"" .Nothing to lose revolves around corporate marketing man Nick (Tim Robbins) who thinks his wife is cheating on him when he comes home earlier than expected. He is devastated and does not care what happens to him once his world falls apart. So he just drives away ending up in the bad part of town. A robber named ""T.Paul"" (Martin Lawrence) then jumps into Nick's SUV and threaten him with a gun. For some strange reason he throws his billfold out the window and says you picked the wrong man on the wrong day. From there on it is a wild and goofy journey from the L.A. slums to the Arizona desert and then back to L.A. to do a ""Big Job"".The many fights and dumb scenes are just not funny or clever. The movie never clicks for plot or jokes."
3,I thought this movie was hilarious the first time I saw it,"Then I bought the video and after watching it more than a few times, I found that I was increasingly offended by the language and a few of the graphic scenes. Call me a prude if you will, but Martin Lawrence must say the ""F"" word about 100 times in this movie, I can take it a few times, but not constantly throughout the movie. Granted that is the Martin Lawrence style, but I wish he would realize that he would be just as funny if he took that word out of his vocabulary. Some of the scenes with the two psycho guys are too much for me too. If you don't mind any of that stuff, then buy the movie, all in all it is pretty funny."
4,From Bad To Worse,"In ""Nothing To Lose"" Nick Beam (Tim Robbins), a white executive from the suburbs of Los Angeles, is having a really bad day. To start with, he walks in on his wife in bed with another man. He's having a really rough time with his boss. And to top it all off, he gets carjacked by T.(Terrence) Paul (Martin Lawrence). Feeling he has ""nothing to lose,"" Nick decides to turn the tables on this would be carjacker and take him for the action packed thrill ride of his life.In this 1997 comedy, directed by Steve Oedekerk, you will get 98 minutes of gut busting laughs. If you like comedies with lots of action, hold-ups, high speed chases, and revenge, I would recommend this movie to you.I give this film four stars because, while it is a very funny film, it does have a lot of foul language. Therefore, I wouldn't recommend this film for young people, or people who prefer to keep young sensitive ears."
4,This is a super funny movie,Hilarious movie! This is a movie with some real life possibilities but is incredibly funny and not the stupid humor type.
2,"average buddy,buddy film","another one of those buddy,buddy films that is average at best.the White character is well to do and the Black Character has Po-Po problems.also Martin Lawrence is stuck with that 2nd rate Eddie Murphy jive routine to get him out of trouble.very predictable."
2,Winging it simply doesn't make a good movie,"Steve Oedekirk's tepid Nothing to Lose is a lame comedy with Tim Robbins and Martin Lawrence as an odd-couple buddy pairing who team up to steal $600, 000. Robbin's comes home early to find his wife in bed with his boss and runs away to the desert, taking car-jacker Lawrence with him, to think things over.The dialogue is hackneyed and stilted, the plot is horribly contrived and Lawrence seems to have been given freedom to improvise, which is is clearly not good at. He resorts mainly to doing his xenophobic 'Oooh white folks' thing while Robbins lumbers around like an idiot.None of the jokes work, the humor is far from clever and the set-ups are obvious. The bland photography and silly score are so incredibly 90s that the film, merely ten years old, looks heavily dated.There are better things that you could be doing with your time."
2,The sound is not true,"I'm a fanatic when it comes to sound and I could not be more disappointed with ""Nothing to Lose"". Not only does it not use the rear surround channels effectively (extremely low volume with echo), the subwoofer channel is not used! I had it cranked in several parts of the movie where the subwoofer should have been a no-brainer and nothing was there! In my DVD collection of 25, this one has to be turned up an extra 10 Db just to hear it. And no, my receiver or speakers are not damaged--I watch movies all the time. The VHS recorded version I have from Showtime sounds better. Why would Touchstone have released it this way?"
1,Incredibly Stuid,"If I could give this movie a negative 5, that would be generous. This ranks as the absolutely worst movie I have ever seen. No plot, no storyline, unbelievable situations, poor acting, etc. I own almost 200 DVDs, but if Hollywood were to put out this sort of mindless crap all the time, I would not own any movies. Folks, do yourself a big, big favor and pass by this movie. Want a tip on a good movie, get Save The Last Dance to include the deleted scenes save the ""Record Shop"" scene. That movie by director Thomas Carter dealt with real life issues in a sensitive and intelligent way-the director made you care about the characters. If you ignor my warning, you'll have ""Something To Lose""."
3,Worth a thousand laughs! Lawrence is at his best.,This is a hilarious story that had me laughing from start to finish. Language is strong but typical of Martin. Tim Robbins is outstanding as the straight guy but grabs a lot of laughs in his own way. The combo of Lawrence and Robbins is an excellent fit. The diner scene is outrageously funny and sets the tone for the rest of the movie.
2,"Decent, but forgettable",Good chemistry between Robbins and Lawerence. Recommended for late saturday nights.
5,What can I say?,Pairing Tim Robbins with Martin Lawrence was creative genius...I can't tell you how many times I've watched this movie...I always laugh like it was the first time..
5,CLASSIC,this movie is PERFECT..from the beggining to the end..point blank period...anybody who rate this movie 1 or 2 star is stupid...and i mean it for real
3,DISAPPOINTED,"I was disappointed that it was the widescrren version and not the regular version. I didn't order the wide scrren one bu t was sent it, so maybe that is the only version you have."
3,funny and entertaining,"The part where Tim Robin's feet goes on fire is hysterical. There are several other very funny parts also. If you don't mind alot of vulgar language and like a funny, entertaining movie, then you may like this one. There are alot better, without the bad language, but this is still a good movie."
4,"Sometimes laugh out loud, sometimes lame.","Yep. That's about it. I rate it four stars because the laugh out loud scenes are very, very good and there were four or five of them. The end is obvious and the middle is more than a little wierd with the revenge-seeking bad guys (it's almost like the director is trying too hard to make it surreal) but somehow the movie works.Definitely do not watch this movie with children - there are tremendous amounts of vulgar language, including a funny scene in which everyone is screaming obscenities and no one is paying a bit of attention."
5,Funniest Movie in a Long Time!,This has to be one of the best comedies I've ever seen. This movie had great music and a fantastic cast. The part with the spider and the hill billy are extremely funny. I've watched this movie at least 25 times and would recommend it to anyone.
3,It Was Cool,This a hilarious movie about a man that thinks his wife is cheating on him and a man that can't stop robbing every store that he visits. Tim Robbins plays a man with a good job but he thinks his wife is cheating on him and Martin Lawrence plays a man that can't get a job so he is always robbing cheap convenience stores. Tim Robbins is going on a rampage down the road not caring if anyone hits him or anything like that but now I got to leave
5,One of the FUNNIEST MOVIES of the decade!,"Teaming Martin Lawrence with Tim Robbins was a smart idea! This movie was hilarious from start to finish! It also has some surprising twists, and is a fun movie to watch, if you don't mind the raw language, which gets pretty grating at times. Highly recommended!"
5,Good bang for the buck,"There are many GBICs out there and many manufacturers ""recommend"" that you buy theirs (Cisco GBIC for a Cisco switch, etc).We've had no problem in using the NetGears we've purchased for multiple kinds of switches.For the price, they can't be beat."
3,gift,"a decent gift for a nephew with an inquiring mind. i don't know how he responded to it, and i did not read it myself."
3,Good - Not in depth enough,"This book was pretty good, great for a quick read on a vacation or in your spare time, but bad if you want in depth information. I probably could have written the whole book myself just with information available from the internet/movies. The humorous approach was nice and kept the mood of the book light."
3,I think I know.....,"I stumbled upon this item looking for information on the 3rd Season release. I've searched around on other sites and *apparently* this DVD set is the first 12 episodes of Season 1. It *apparently* is a Canadian release, but who knows. All I know is if you own the Season 1 set, don't buy this. Mind you, all this is second hand info, but I found it on a site I trust. I myself don't own this set, I do own the 1st & 2nd Season sets, though, and HIGHLY recommend them. Hope this helps."
3,Help Please?,"Sooooo..... is this part of CSI the series? If so, where does it fit in? Is it a single DVD that's got stuff that's part of what's been released in a set, is it something completely different? ...I'm a bit confused and don't want to buy it if I'm going to get stuff that's already in the complete series set.Anyone out there know?"
5,First Season CSI,"This number one rated show has twelve episodes from the first season and is unbelievable, this thrilling criminal investigation program uses all the technolodgy available and is one that will contain its emotional roller coaster all the way through the show. A must see for any Sci Fi buff!"
3,"Great show, really bad sound","My sister bought CSI: Early Cases. I'm watching the second episode right now. The show itself is great fun to watch, although I did have to get through the whole ""it doesn't really work that way"" thing (husband and dad are cops, friend is CSI).My problem with this set is that the sound varies wildly in volume. Anything with music is too loud, anything with speech is too soft. There is no happy medium. I've been watching it with the subtitles on (a nice feature) because the sound is so bad.The video looks good, but I probably wouldn't buy this for myself and I sure won't be buying the full series until I find out if the sound is better."
3,Darkness Tolls / Horror Express - Satanic Rites Of Dracula - Horror Hotel,"Satanic Rites Of Dracula the last for christopher lee as dracula,not as good as the earlier dracula movies but no regret as long it was acted by lee and van helsing (peter cushing) will give 3 stars.Horror hotel i found that the quality of the picture was not very clear but the movie was watchable.will also give 3 starsHorror Express was good as the two great hammer icon lee and cushing was cast in this movie,believe without them the shows would have been boring.AAA+"
1,Merriam-Webster Notebook Value Pack,"It was a great idea for a 6th grader who's learning to carry lots of things around from class to class to have a dictionary and thesaurus (with holes) that fit into his 3-ring binder.... Unfortunately, the print was too tiny for him to read without a magnifying glass; thereby, it's not usable :("
2,Disappointed,"Flag was fine but there was no sleeve for my flag pole, only 2 grommets on the end.which made it difficult to hang"
3,easy fun for kids,"I bought this for my son (8 years old)just for fun. It is inexpensive and works. Could be put in gift bags after a party. It is 'goofy' and fun. It isn't for playing with for hours, but it is entertaining. I bought 2 so he could race with a friend."
3,Another step to end the suicide myth,"I have read many books on the subject of Marilyn's life and mysterious death. This new addition was well reseached. But as long as the Greenson family and children keep silent. The truth of what happen on that August night will never come to light,and so the legend will go on."
1,THE WOLFE'S CONSPIRANCY,"The Wolfe's investigation about the last days of Marilyn Monroe is a rewriting version of the classic book ""Goddess"" (Anthony Summers). It's very boring and forget many of the importants pages of ""Marilyn. The biography"" (Donald Spoto). Wolfe follows the line of conspirancy and see the Kennedys like a killers (a fascinating line to the readers who don't know the reality)."
5,Marilyn's voice from the grave,"After reading this book, there's no doubt in my mind that Marilyn was murdered; and the Kennedys were involved. I live in Northern California, and am very serious about wanting her case to be investigated. I've loved Marilyn all my life and want justice. If you are serious about this as well, please email me. No jokes, only serious fans who want justice for Marilyn."
4,Big Piece of the Puzzle,Really well documented and exhaustive investigation about Marilyn's last days. This book brings new evidence and realistic facts about a possible (and probable) conspiracy that could have taken place in 1962 and reviews in detail what could have been the role of Marilyn's entourage in the murder. One of the most fascinating books about Marilyn because it finally gives a good example a journalism and avoids speculation about . Highly recommended !
1,murdered or not mr. wolfe doesn't tell real story not profitable for him,Nancy Miracle wrote the real story and Mr. Wolfe stole what he could the only real story is told and available through the marilyn monroe foundation marilyn monroe had a real life and that real life is available =through the marilyn monroe foundation only
5,Riveting Story!!,"I've read several books on Miss Monroe's life. This is the first book to provide evidence from several different sources to prove she did not commit suicide, but was murdered. What a sad way to end a sad life."
5,Thought-provoking,"Mr. Wolfe's book is the best book on the death of Marilyn Monroe that I've ever read. Due to difficulties in determining what actually happened, we may never know the truth. However, Mr. Wolfe has presented a compelling explanation for Marilyn's death. Some of the unanswered questions raised by Mr. Wolfe's book could still be answered even today IF the powers that be in Los Angeles County would convene an inquest and take testimony under oath. ... Marilyn deserves better."
5,Wow! Jump back! It's Def Leppard!,"This is a MUST have for any Def Leppard fan. I loved it from the first look. It has all the DL videos starting from ""Hello America"" all the way to ""Love Bite"" If you don't have this, get it!"
5,Historia,"The other review is all wrong, this isn't the movie, this is the original videos and they are great. Since VH1 and MTV don't supply me with enough Def Leppard this hits the basics and is a great addition to your Def Leppard Collection. It's a must have, see Steve Clark at his finest."
1,did not work,"This cable did not work, very disappointed. I just tried it last week so I suppose I won't get a replacement as I bought it a while back and have not had time to address the problem."
3,skip this one,"I thought it be great to have one cable for video and sound, but this cable generates lots of noise. Spend the money and buy seperate cables. As a vga cable it works fine, though"
2,Disappointed,"Very disappointed, the picture rolled and the audio had a constant hum. Going with HDMI and wireless speakers at this point. Unfortunately the restock fees and shipping did not make this item worth returning so I am out $21.00."
2,"Lacks poems from good poets, too broad sampling from inferior poets","This books is very disappointing. Many, many of the poets are 2nd rate and their poems take up valuable space. One can't escape the fact that this is a politically correct collection, though in all honesty it could have been worse. Many of the poets should have been referenced in an essay or essays in this long book. The authors should have used Oscar Williams' collections of American and British poetry as their model. Goia is a would-be formalist, but a decidedly inferior poet and his taste, given this anthology is bad. No poems from Katharine Byer, Christine Garren, Ellen Voight, or Edgar Bowers(no Bowers, what a joke!) or many other first rate poets with something to say and who say it well. Many will say it's just opinion, but the anthologists must be held accountable for their selections (and hence their opinions). Not worth buying at any price."
5,Great,Great resource book to go along with the Bible....Great references. I have about 10 of the series and will buy whatever it takes when studying the WORD!~
4,Lovely Overview of the Fae World,"I thought this was a very nice compendium of faery types for those who may not want to delve really deep into the lore. I have been reading on the faeries for twenty-five years, and certainly would recommend this to someone who wanted a good over-view of the subject. I very much appreciated Mr. Melville's respectful attitude toward them and this earth they sustain and protect. I felt very good after reading this book, and appreciate the reverence that went into the writing of it. Great illustrations too -- some of them reminded me of the work of Marc Chagall."
4,Nice and well put together book,"Melville did a wonderful job in puting this book together and the information in it, is absoutly stunning. Although at times I wish he had given more information on some of the faeries (Such as the Undines). The illustrations are pretty good, but I rather have a book with no illlustrations in it at all.This book has 5 chapters:Elementals & Nature Spirits (Sylphs, Devas, Elves, ect.)Faery Helpers (Brownies, Dwarfs, Domovoi, ect.)Tricksters & Seducers (Leprechauns, Pixies, Morgan le Fay, ect.)Angelic Faeries (Peris, Erotes, Lauma, ect.)Rituals & RecipesI give this book a 4.5 stars overall."
5,A Great Book for Children to Read,"This was the first Fey book that I had bought. It really introduced you to the different types of basic Fey.My children loved the book...don't say the their names in the house....call them the little folk.When I grew up, imagination was put away in a box. I don't want that for my children. I believe there is another diminison where these beings live.....Keep the Magick alive! Believe..."
3,"ok read, but not great","Not gonna lie , there are much better books on this subject out there.But what the heck give it a read."
2,nice language but little else,"There is such a thing as being too subtle and too dependant on symbolism. Ms Cohen uses foreshadowing that doesn't go anywhere. The reader is led to believe that the sisters will gain some insight into the mystery that has always puzzled them and it never happens. scenes that should pack an emotional punch just kind of lie there. Ms Cohen is a very talented wordsmith but it doesn't fell like she's emotionally invested in her material so how can she expect the reader to be? I left this book on the subway, I hope the person who picked it up enjoyed it more then I did."
1,Painful from Start to Finish,We read this book for my book group and out of ten people - not one of us liked this book.The plot seemed so overdone and the characters seemed very hollow. If you want a good book written from a child's perspective read Midwives - it was much better.
1,One of the worst movies I've ever seen,"Someone needs to tell the director that two people talking at the same time isn't funny. The joke with the lightning can be seen a mile away, and it's also stolen from the much better ""Caddyshack"". Avoid this unfunny, inept film at all costs."
1,Better Throw This One Back,One of the worst most unfunny comedies I've ever sat through in my life and I mean only once. Avoid at all costs.
2,Simpleminded fun,"Okay, so this is a film about extreme idiots. But it isn't quite as bad as the critics said it was when it came out. The characters are likeable enough. Kids may enjoy it."
4,My family and I enjoyed this movie!,"I realize that this film was a no-brainer, but the actors were excellent, and the fact that there was no profanity was certainly a breath of fresh air. This is one of the few films that I have seen lately that the whole family can watch. The screen saver on my computer constantly flashes, Gone Fishin!"
1,Strong cast delievers a stinker,Looking at who is in the movie you would think it wouldn't be a stinker. It was big time. Nothing seemed to work when it came to the comedy and since its a comedy movie that is essential of course. I had this film recommended by a guy at my work. Lets just say I am not going to take any more of his advice. He told me this was one of the funniest movies he has ever seen.
1,doesn' work how do I return it and get one that does work? Shipping cost almost as much as DVD.,I need to return this. What do I do since Amazon was not the sender? What can you say if teh product doesn't work and the shippind cost almost as much at the item. Please tell me how to ge this replaced ASAP. It was a gift to my son who just recently opened it and tried it in 4 different players. Noe worked!!!!
1,Worst movie I have ever seen! STAY CLEAR!,"This is the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. I don't know how they got Pecsi and Glover to be in it, they must have owed someone a favor. The entire movie seems like it was written by a 4 year old. The dialogue is painful to listen to. The movie starts out with 2 little boys fishing in a river. It then fast fowards about 35 years into the future. The only problem is they still have the minds of little boys. Imagine Dumb & Dumber with absolutely no funny lines or jokes and that is Gone Fishin'. If you just got a lobotomy you MIGHT enjoy this movie, but you would probably enjoy drooling in a corner better. I would give it a minus rating if I could but 1 is the lowest they allow. YOU'VE BEEN WARNED!"
4,Very Funnnnny. Good Family Movie,"I like comedy. A lot. This movie is a classic dumb, funny, gag comedy. I read some reviews about this movie and frankly don't understand how some people think. Get a life! Laugh a little. I guess some people think Joe Pesci has to inject four letter words into every sentence to be funny. This movie proves he doesn't. Great movie. Grab the kids. Family time. More movies should be clean and funny like this. Two thumbs and hands and arms up!!!Phil"
3,Good family entertainment.,"This movie, although not destined to be labeled a ""classic"", is not at all bad. It has some flat moments, but quite a few good laughs. No cussing, no nudity, no blood and guts, just lots of corny, slapstick action. I first saw it at the movies, and the entire audience *really* laughed. It's a keeper."
3,A sleeper of a slapstick family entertainment comedy.,"This video received little notice in major reviews but provides great family entertainment. A sleeper of a movie, it deserves better acclaim, and features great acting and comedy situations that keep going throughout the feature. Although some parts can be dull (Willie Nelson has a bit part that could be spiced up a degree), the overall film was very enjoyable and should appeal to the broader audience. Rated PG. Will be great when released on DVD."
5,Hilarious movie with two great actors.,"I really enjoy this DVD. It is one of the funniest, pure slapstick, movies I've ever seen. Joe Pesci and Danny Glover are at their best in this remarkable tale of travesty and luck."
1,What a WASTE!,"I almost hate to admit it, but I paid full price to see this in a cinema.When the movie started we thought for SURE that it was a gag... We kept waiting for the REAL movie to start. When the credits started rolling at the end, we knew that that WAS the movie!If I had to guess, Joe and Danny owed someone a HUGE favor as I just can't imagine either of them being excited about this FLOP!!!If this thing only had a price of $0.01 it would be over-priced!"
3,Gone Fishin',You'll either hate it or love it. Great cast of stars including a cameo by Willie Nelson (representing the would-be spirit of all fly fishermen). The Dumb and dumber movie of the fly-fishing world. VERY funny and a good family flick. Some reused stunts but a lot of creative ones too. A real good spoof on those that would rather fish than anything else. Don't pay attention to those negative reviews - check it out for yourself. A sleeper of a comedy. Waiting for the DVD version with cut scenes.
1,worthless item,This item was not as described. The disc itself was filthy. Movie stalled repeatedly and we had to go backward and forward to get it started again. Sad. Thanks Amazon for a great returns policy... never had to use it before.
3,"Dumb But Innocent, And That's Not So Bad","This was ""Dumb and Dumber"" without the crudeness and profanity.That doesn't mean it's an award winner: it's pretty stupid, but it is refreshing to see a movie in which both Joe Pesci and Danny Glover star and never utter a profane word! Unbelievable! And you can add Rosanna Arquett to that list, too, and she wasn't exactly Mother Teresa in a lot of her other films.The professional critics totally lambasted this film, which wasn't altogether fair, either. It is refreshing in its innocence (something critics know nothing about) and it has its funny moments. Best of all it's entertaining.Yes, this is ""Lightweight"" with a capital ""L"" but I've seen a whole lot of films that were the opposite and total garbage. At least you watch this with your kids and have some laughs. What's wrong with that?"
5,Gone Fishing,"If you like fishing, watch this movie, cuz it is funny. Them guys work all their life and they need a break to go far a way fishing in a different state. They had bad days and good days. Funny movie to watch."
2,"Good actors, average movie","The actors on the video are top quality in most projects but this movie is average at best. A few funny scenes, but underscore the word FEW. This movie does not display the talent that these actors actually possess."
5,Danny Glover and Joe Pesci together!,"Wow! It's Danny Glover and Joe Pesci all on one screen at once. On their fishing trip several hilarious mishaps come their way, but in the end, they end up having a good time after all. The Willie Nelson song in this film is catchy as well as the music in the credits scene. If you are a fan of both Danny Glover and Joe Pesci, buy this film even if you don't fish!"
1,worst movie I could think of,"I liked the idea of the reviews, so I thought of the worst movie i've seen in a long while and here it is."
4,A great explanation of the classic Alpine,"In this text, Robson provides an interesting and thorough overview of the classic Sunbeam Alpine and its younger brother, the Tiger. This text tracks the Alpine and Rootes Group story from long before its conception, through each iteration of the Alpine and the birth of the Tiger, their success in racing, and the eventual discontinuation of the Alpine/Tiger. This text is not suitable as a restoration guide as it does not contain enough pictures, but it is nevertheless an interesting read for anyone who may own or is otherwise interested in this relatively unheard of classic British sports car."
5,Everybody should dig this CD,"This wonderful trio recording provides an excellent showcase for Evans' piano. He is in peak form, whether examining a jazz standard (""Night and Day,"" ""Tenderly"") or adding a new twist to Sonny Rollins' ""Oleo."" His solo contribution, ""Peace Piece"" is the prototypical track for jazz musicians to study. Every track on this album is a delight."
2,William Cooper,"although there was some interesting information in his book, it didn't paint a very good picture of the late William Cooper. Mr Cooper did write a book called 'behold the pale horse, which I found more interesting. John CrippenBehold a Pale Horse"
5,Hardest Workout,"The hardest sets from Spinervals in one two hour workout set... if you can survive it.Race simulations, acceleration sets, super spins and more to improve your pedaling technique, increase your power output and build speed."
5,Spinervals 9.0 Have Mercy DVD,Great video!!!! Have mercy is right!!! Don't get this video unless you're prepared to suffer.
4,Nice,This is by far the best softball glove I have ever owned. It was pretty much game ready the day I recieved it. It is an outfielders glove but i have no problem gobblin up ground balls at pitch with it so it can be used for any position.I wish I would have bought this glove five years ago instead of wasteing money on two gloves that cost half as much as this glove. I ranked it 4 out of five stars because I know there has to be a better glove out there I just haven't used it or probably ever will.
2,Don't use this monitor for gaming,"If, like me, you enjoy playing a variety of computer games, don't get this monitor. With a large number of games, the monitor ""complains"" about the resolution. The monitor is plainly able to display a variety of resolutions just fine, but it plasters a banner in the middle of the the screen that says ""Not Optimal Mode. Use 1280x1024 @60Hz"". After two minutes, the screen goes blank. If you turn the monitor off, then on, you get another two minutes. If you wish to remove the banner from the middle of the screen, press the ""brightness"" button, then the ""menu"" button. But you still only get two minutes of viewing time. This problem so completely trumps any considerations of clarity, contrast ratio, and brightness that I won't bother mentioning those minor criteria. I HATE this monitor because it can display all video signals just fine, it simply CHOOSES not to!"
5,This is a great book,"This is a great book all the examples are alot more interesting when compared to the many other programming books I have read. I think every C programmer must read it more than once, every single line is valuable."
1,Another useless book from the ill-famous Russian copy-paster,"Another useless book from the ill-famous Russian copy-paster.1) Author is not an expert in anything he writes about. His level of knowledge is close to one of a sophomore.2) Book was unprofessionally translated from Russian, it's hard to read.3) Morale and legal aspects of many pranks and tricks are questionable for an educated and law-obeying reader."
1,full of errors,"Do not buy this book. The positive reviewers do not have any other reviews on amazon -it really looks like self-reviewed by the author.I've read this book, its full of mistakes. For instance, the authors says that TCP works by sending packages -- no comments, but for everybody else (beside the author) TCP works with segments. The list of mistakes is way to long. You should also note, that whenever a negative review is posted, a positive review (written by reviewers with no other reviews on amazon) follows. This book is very poor and a waste of money and time."
1,very out of date - would be good in 1997,"Full of ancient little code nuggets - like how to make a non-rectangular window in Windows. The author even calls MFC ""cutting edge."" Give me a break. MFC is barely being maintained any more - it might have been cutting edge 10 years ago. I'd suggest passing on this one - unless you want to feel like you're in a time-machine back to the C++ of the last century."
5,EXCELLENT AND VERY EASY,"I'm trying to find words to discribe it, only one comes to my mind - SUPER!!! Perfect!!! I recommend Hackish C++ to all!!!"
2,So he pranks around in C++ so what?,"I'm ashamed to say I bought this book. I read it in about an hour. He has a few tricks to teach us about how to make windows components dance around, dissappear, change etc. So what? Where is the meat of C++ programming in this book. He knows his way around the Windows API, so what. He knows how to freak out his co-workers. So what. Where is Scott Meyers when you need him? Where is Andrew LaMott ( <== spelling? ) ....I was expecting to see some C++ tricks and was disappointed. TCP/IP is great for sending/receiving stuff. So what. Where is the C++ stuff in this book. Look around for another book to show you some C++ stuff. This ain't the one."
1,These reviewers look like the same person.,"This book attracted me because of the high sales ranking and the reviewer ratings. But after reading these reviews, I thought that they are all liars.If you read the reviewers' other reviews, you won't find any. Think first before you buy this book."
3,A Decent Movie,"A simple plot and lots of special effects. The movie could have been better. The story is a bit boring and fake but will keep you entertained. The movie lacks the abilities of Spawn. It should have shown more about him and his costume, and it would have been better with his mask on more often instead of that burnt face. It will keep you entertained but, you will probaly not want to see it again."
1,They Made A Sequel?,"I can't believe this even made it out on video. This is the worst video I have ever seen. I kept thinking through the whole video, if only they had a plot, talented actors, and a good director. But wait, that is what entirely makes up a video! If I ever see another copy of this video, I will set it on fire so as to prevent others from the horror they would surely face. But since the director obviously didn't spend too much money making this movie, they didn't lose much of an investment. When I went on-line to give my review, I was flabergasted that they actually made a sequel to such a terrible movie. Trust me, I won't make the same mistake again. I urge you, don't waste your time on this video. It could be better spent watching grass grow or watching paint dry."
3,awesome/ok movie,I love SPAWN alot and the animated series through the comics are just phenomal but the movie itself was just ok not the best but just an ok movie for what it was back in 1992 the storyline was awesome I just hope that somebody will bring back the anit-hero back on screen by the way there's a reboot but the date is still Unknown.
4,Pretty awesome movie,It was pretty great. I remember seeing it as a kid in the 90's and even today its pretty sick to watch.It was a birthday present for my cousin and she loved it too. Now they just need to make a second one or new one for todays era.
4,Great Movie for what it is,"Most people see it as a cheasy 90's movie that had bad acting, but I thought the movie was great for what it was. It is actually based off of a comic series of the same name. I thought the movie was great because we see so many stereotypical super hero movies, and spawn was the opposite. His character is alot darker than most(he's a ressurected human from hell)and he actually start off doing work for Satin. Honestly this movie was just ahead of its time, which is why it suffered. Before we had Spiderman,Xmen,Jonah Hex,Captain America, and now even Thor is coming out, there was Spawn which came out in a time where special effects were nothing compared to what they are today. If you can get past the cheasyness, and the rough acting then Its a good buy in my opinion."
1,Appallingly horrible-please erase this movie from my mind,"The story line was terrible, and the clown did lots of immature not funny things like flammable farts. The special effects were really good in most parts but the Devil looked so stupid and fake that the only reason we stayed through this bloodfart of a movie was so we could laugh at the Devil some more. His mouth didn't move hardly at all when he spoke--we still imitate it to this day. A shame, I thought the person who played Spawn was a decent actor, and it was a nice change to see a black main character that isn't playing some negative sterotype. But that couldn't make up for the horrible storyline."
1,Not too good,"In the future there will be Art House revivals ""Horribly Camp Super Hero Movies"" and this will play along with Lee's Hulk and the original 60's Batman Movie. Hell lets make one now and drop in Batman Forever in there."
1,This movie is terrible,"I was really disappointed with this DVD. The visual special effects are definitely dated. The sound effects were good, but not enough to make this movie worth the time spent watching it.I can not recommend this movie."
2,It has an awesome soundtrack.,"I used to read the spawn comic book when I was younger and then I saw this film in the theaters when I was 11 and I was disappointed even then. The R-rated cut is a very slight improvement, but the R-rated version was still intended originally to be PG-13 so it doesn't do much.The best things to come out of this movie are John Leguizamo's ultra obnoxious performance as the clown (The clown was always obnoxious in the comics) and the metal/industrial soundtrack. Other than that it was kind of a turd.Bad plot, bad acting, bad special fx."
2,Ehh - They Didn't Do It Right,"If you watched the original animated series on HBO back in the day, then saw this you'd know what I mean. They just didn't do the movie right. Way too tame. And yes, I understand that cleaning things up so the kiddies can watch too means more money, but the original Spawn comics and animated series were DRASTICALLY more adult than the movie was, and as such, I was bored.Not bad by any means, but they just didn't do it right."
3,I use to really like it.,"When I was little and this movie was just released on video I though it was awsome, because of all the flashy, fantastic special effects, but when I got older I got wiser. The reason this movie gets 3 stars is because of the great special effects job. This is recommended to people who don't mind dumb screenplays, direction, ect. and watch action pictures just for the thrill of it all.The acting is ok, but the film is miss casted in my opinion. I don't think I will ever watch HBO's Animated Spawn series."
2,Needs Work,I first saw Spawn in 1999. It was interesting and enjoyable. The special effects were pretty good and Martin Sheen and John Leguizamo were convincing enough as bad guys but the story was just about death and vengence. You never know Spawn's feelings. Based on a comic book I thought it was going to be fantastic but it is too dark.
1,"Great Explosions, Terrible Plot.","If you're happy simply with big explosions in your movies, you'll like it, but if you want a decent plot look elsewhere. I thought this movie was terrible."
1,Spawnee me no likee,"Great if you like random special effects that almost lead to nowhere, overblown production, alot of noise, and a bothersome unfunny clown that laughs at his own clueless jokes. One sickening pizza scene will make you think twice about when to eat when you decide to watch this movie. Even the dialogue seems forced. Spawn fans may be ultimately forgiving, one way or the other."
1,Worse than Bats!,"This movie is disgusting, violent, not worth anything and there are many more reasons not to buy this piece of trash! Horrible video, do NOT buy!"
4,"Well I liked it, so there!","Geez, lighten up you guys! You all sound like trekkies debating TOS Vs. NextGen! This was a good movie, and I'll admit I didn't like it as much the first time, and I couldn't even tell you why. But I did buy the thing and enjoy it now. The commentary was revealing and lively, and the behind-the-scenes things (althought the same as the VHS) are good too. McFarlane is the most egotistical man on the planet, but ya gotta love him! This is no Tim Burton's Batman, but it'll do pig, it'll do. One thing I really didn't like was Martin Sheen's character, it blew. I've seen the animated one and he blew even more in that. I hope in Spawn 2 they have a real villain instead."
1,it was 2 thumbs down,"It was the is was the worst movie I have ever seen.It was about hell and death and bad things like that. I fell asleep the first time I saw it in '97 and my friend just bought it and I stayed awake, but the day I saw it was the she got it and that day she took it back."
2,Trash,This movie is possibly the worst movie I've ever seen. The only reason I gave it two stars instead of one is because I thought John Leguizamo was funny.
1,Worst movie based on a comic book character.,"When I watched this movie for the first time I was expecting something like The Crow, I mean Spawn is a character from hell, but boy oh boy was I disappointed. Spawn may rule the comic book and action figure industry but creator Todd McFarlane needs to learn a lot about the movie industry. The story was not well written, the actors' performance were so-so, and the special effects were nothing special. The only thing cool was Spawn's cape but you don't get to see much of that either."
2,Loved that Red Cape!,"While I loved the red cape and the demonic clown was disgustingly good, this movie was so weak. Character development was nonexistent. We never learned enough about Al Simmons before he is turned into the crispy superhero to really feel for him. We don't see him with Wanda to get a feel for why he would give up his soul for her love. The only thing this movie had was special effects, especially that red cape."
3,Spawn is OK; Great special effects,"I was truly impressed with Michael Jai White and would like to know if anyone has any information on him. If you like dark, satanic-oriented movies, and great special effects, you'll like this movie. Just don't go for the great dialogue. Please forward any information on Michael Jai White."
3,John Leguzamo stole this picture.,"The special effects were so-so, this was a movie that could really have used a lot of CGI help. But, John Leguzamo's performance saved this bland outing. His hilarious low brow humor, perverse, obnoxious, evil clown was just terrific. His performance made this bland production watchable. Very few actors can save a movie, the only other one I can think of is Gary Oldman, he's terrific also. Like I said John stole this picture."
2,The HBO Spawn was better,What trips me out is that most of the principle charecters were black in the comic book and cartoon. This is what you call covering their bases and to make it a PG-13 movie was the wrong move. That why a lot of people went to see Blade because it wasn't a PC type movie. Spawn lacks the level of violence and taboo storytelling that the previous efforts have. I wasn't impressed.
2,John Leguzamo steals the show again,"John is such a versatile actor you'd he would be doing more movies. He has the same range of talent that Johnny Depp has,but where Depp has delicate and androgonus features, John is rougher around the edges but their talent is so obvious. John stole this movie, the CGI wasen't up to snuff, but I think most of these types of movie rely to much on that and don't let the characters do the acting or tell the story. I enjoyed it."
2,Style over subtance,"Spectacular special effects, a spooky prduction design, and superb action sequences can't overcome a vague and confusing plot. Although watchable, you'll probably hate yourself the next day."
1,1 Star Blu Ray Release: Shameful!!!,"Spawn Blu Ray doesn't even have a menu, not to mention any of subtitles, special features...JUST THE MOVIE [and so-so transfer at that!]"
4,"Cool superhero concept, unfortunately with crude humor and dated visual effects","Spawn is a cool concept of a superhero--the story of Spawn and his demonic adversaries is interesting, and Spawn has an interesting array of superpowers. Keep in mind, however, that it is a dark story with a lot of crude humor. The visual effects are very dated as well. If you can enjoy the story for its creative elements and the unfolding of Spawn's superpowers, you will enjoy this movie (like I did). Otherwise, probably best to skip it."
2,Hollywood did again....,"This is movie is based on my favorite comic ""hero"" and it ends up sucking. I'm not even going to say anything except that1.They should have let Todd McFarlane write and direct this2.Hollywood should get shot for making this film3.PG-13? Are you kidding me...this ain't no kiddy comic man!This film was just terrible but I must say the CGI is terrific in this film but that's it....Unlike the comics or animated series you won't find..ProfanityGraphic ViolenceDisturbing imagry and this list go's on.Even in this ""Directors Cut"" there are only two major difference in this and the PG-13 one which is...Al says a naughty word!!! Oh my gosh! And the other one is him shooting that girl in the head...This movie flat out sucks...2.1 out of 5 stars....If you really wanna watch Spawn it's all hell and out of controll way watch the Animated Series from HBO.Thats All I gotta say...Lates"
3,Doesn't compare to the comic book.,"This film was well crafted from a collaboration of Todd McFarlane and director/visual effects wizard Mark Dippe. I'm not saying that this movie was exceptionally good nor all that bad, but it still could've used some work. Spawn(Comic book)is a very graphic and very detailed look at crime and mobsters, the movie however revolves around Jason Wynn(Martin Sheen)who has his mind set on world domination. The story was somewhat weak compared to the comic book considering that if the comic was put on screen, it would have an NC-17 rating slapped on it. The DVD however is a step up from the theatrical release because it is the director's cut. This has a very good amount of extras that I enjoyed watching as well. If you're a fan of visual effects you may want to take a look because this film is purely based upon effects rather than plot."
1,I feel shame,"This COULD have been a decent movie. The Story barely tells you about the charector Spawn and Al Sommions <SuperMan did it the best, and BatMan did it good to>, Costume ......<not as bad as the ones in Batman and Robin, but the siut just dont dont fit right> Story was bad to <for some reason I just felt bored with it>, The Only thing i liked was Clown and the Cape that was all."
3,Good but not great,"When i first saw this movie, I thought the special effects were terrific, and it really got me interested into the Spawn character. At that time i would of rated the movie as a five, but after watching the HBO cartoon series and reading the majority of the comic books, I now think that the movie wasn't that great, or at least I thought it could of been a lot better, it really doesn't do the character of Spawn justice."
1,The animated one rules. . . this sucks!!,"I loved the animated version of spawn! It gets really into things, by bringing you 3, 2 and a half hour movies, which have as much blood, gore, nudity, and bad language as you want, because of the fact that it doesn't need to be rated ""pg-13"". This movie however, tried to cram the whole story of spawn into a 2 hour film. Now this just isn't possible. for The people who gave this film good reviews, you outta see the animated series. And as for the guy who was tripping on acid while watching the movie: Anything can ""blow your mind"" while your trippin'. So there!!!!!!!!"
1,stupid stupid movie,"This is one of the most disapointing movies I have ever seen. It started out stupid and it ended stupis.The people that made this film only payed money for the speacial effects and didn't even think about the plot.John Legosomo is a terrible actor and in his charecter he tried to be funny,well he wasen't at all.The movie moved so slow I went to bed early especially when john leagozomo tried to be funny.The action scenes in that movie were stupid and the dialoge wasen't any good. The only thing that was well done about the movie was the special effects which they spent to much money on that instead. I would not recamdend this movie to anyone at all."
3,It was great fun but a bit jumpy.,"The special effects in this movie are out of this world. Lots of humorous scenes help this movie to stand out. But, unfortunately to many jumpy, skips, only makes this movie 3 stars."
2,Nothing to the animated series.......,"While the special effects were fantastic, the villians were constantly annoying, Spawn has the macho meter on overdrive non stop, and the series as a whole was a bad choice for a 2 hour movie. My advice? et the animated version."
2,sad...,"This flick made me angry and sad but also made my eyes pop at the same time. First off, the film scratches the surface of what the comic book of Spawn is all about. A thin plotline and even thinner characters almost ruined it. But then again the visuals remain among the best I've ever seen. To make a long review short, this is a classic case of style over substance."
3,One hell of a movie,"Spawn is great fun all the way.A movie that lets us suspend our beliefs.The special effects are cool and the fight scenes and action scenes are far out.It may not be oscar worthy,but hey,it's all in good fun."
3,Spawn movie,"I liked the movie , but as usual , Hollywood screwed up , just like they always do , so what if half of America doesn't get it in it's original form , Todd Mcfarlane is a great artist and writer , Hw got robbed when he let the movie be made , just like all the other comic to movies.Bottom line Hollywood will never get it right , Comic Book artists and writers are not treated with respect in Hollywood.HBO was the only one I think did a good job , skip this and get the animated HBO series."
3,FAIRLY MELONCOLLY FAIRLY COOL THE AVERAGE,this live action version of spawn simulates the orgin of al simmons and hellspawn. parts of this movie contain ground breaking special effects and computer animation but the action is somewhat the opposite(but there is quite a bit of it). on the partialy computer generated cover spawn looks quite agile and silky and awsome but in the film he looks like he cant even move his limbs out and he is very bumby and boring not to mention cheesy.but there is a cool scene were spawn leaps out of a large building in slow motion while shooting clips of bullets.people say the pg13 version is worse thaN THE DIRECTOR SCUT I WATCHED IT ITS NOT TRUE.I WOULDNT BUY THIS GO TO YOUR LOCAL VIDEOSTORE AND RENT IT THEN JUDGE IT.
4,"""You've been violated little girlie man!""","Al Simmons is killed by his boss and goes to hell. He comes back to Earth to take revenge on Wynn and to see Wanda again. With him is the hardly recognizable John Leugiazamo (I know I misspelled that) as a clown from hell. Leugiazamo has the best lines in the movie in my view. Al is soon called ""Spawn"" by the clown."
2,Should have been the best comic book movie ever made...,"...but instead the movie version of Spawn is nothing but a disappointment. The special effects and makeup are great, as is John Leguizamo as Clown, but there is a lot of overacting and the storyline is boggled and shameful for something out of the Spawn universe. It gets two stars for special effects/makeup, and John Leguizamo, other than that, it goes right down the crapper."
2,A rentable third rater,"The only thing worse than the odious characters is the tenuous plot...no wait, there's the anemic dialogue...no, the leaden performances, no, actually it's the heavy reliance on the special effects. (Plot? What plot?) Leguizamo's clown is over the top, while Spawn's juvenile emotional state is irritating at best. Everyone trapped in this celluloid hell, in particular Sheen, is undoubtedly better than the material, but oh, what dreadful material. Rent this from the library, and for goodness sakes, don't let your children watch this thing. Leguizamo's character's crude one liners are not for the young, nor are the heavy doses of special effects (Satan is simply nightmarish). Liked the cape...dissatisfied with the film."
3,What's the Difference?,"Ya know, I have seen both the PG-13 and R rated versions of this film, and I honestly could not tell the difference. Will somebody PLEASE tell me exactly how the two versions differ from each other! But anyway, the computer generated graphics were excellent, the soundtrack was dynamic, and the story was well written. However, Clown seemed like a pretty pointless and vulgar character to me."
4,Buy them all by Peggy Kaye,"I purchased this book after purchasing Games for Math, Games for Writing, and Games for learning. I was so impressed with her style and idea of learning through games. These books are true treasure troves. Day one of having this book, i had my children make Bingo boards with their spelling words. They were thrilled to do it, and we played a game after they were finished. One note though, the author does mention something about holding off on a select few of the games until they are reading, because it might interfere with the teaching method the teacher is using, and that parents aren't trained to teach children to read. As a homeschooling family i find that an ignorant opinion, which is why i rated it a '4'. Regardless, there are many great ideas in this and her other books."
4,Games for Reading,"Book was in great condition when it arrived, it arrived promptly and has been excellent for my daughter, she has enjoyed the games we have played"
3,good solid activities,Needs an update....but good low tech activities. Great addition to any elementary classroom or great for at home activites.....includes research based strategies
4,Better than expected,Must admit I thought this movie was iffy. Good movie with a couple of twists. A good watch that moves along quickly.
1,WOWW< BAD!!!!,"I'm tired of wasting money on movies that have actors on the take the money and run route!!!! Dont get me wrong I'm a huge Deniro fan, JUST that this is a BAD movie!!!!!"
1,Good actors don't always make a good film.,"I don't even understand why this was so bad, but it was. Bad meaning bad, not bad meaning good. Don't let the cover fool you."
3,Crooked Law Enforement,Typical bad cops doing bad things and one cuts a deal and turns from the dark side on a journey to the light...
3,freelancer's review,i was a good movie a bit slow at first but you soon see action 50 Cent as a conflicted cop solded me on this this one a good rent but i dont know if im running to get the blu ray.
2,Yes It's ok but,"I had a problem with Curtis Jacksons acting and I don't think it was the character he protrayed. Curtis never showed any anger, compssion, regret etc.. when you are acting you have to be able to show differint emotions through out the role that you are playing. He was very monotone in every scene.I thought the film was ok. However I would not recommend it to any one."
1,I've never heard of this... because it's completely lame,"1. I like checking out DVDs via Redbox and noticed this movie that I've never heard about... with one of my favorite actors (Deniro). Well, the adage is true, if you've never heard of it, there's likely a very good reason for it (ie it's totally lame).2. This is movie is so bad, I mean so bad, that I just couldn't finish it. I just can't believe how bad this movie is and more perplexing is how in the world did DeNiro get involved in this complete dud?"
3,Freelancers Just So-So,"I know Curtis Jackson (50 cents) is not a stellar actor but I like him anyway. Really wanted to like this movie alot because the top 3 cast members are some of my favorites. But alas, as stated by some before the movie is very predictable, the script gets boring at times, definately no Oscar winner here LOL. But I believe the movie was just intended to be entertaining and that it was. Your typical, corrupt cop bang bang shoot-em-up very weak plot type of movie. They are not trying to make a point so just enjoy."
1,"A better name for this movie: ""The Three Stooges""","Not only 50 cent needs more acting lessons, he needs intensive speech lessons too. Great acting from Forest Whitaker and Robert De Niro as usual, but 50 cent just dragged the entire movie down. Very lame story after all."
1,Deniro needs to work what else can it be.,50 is a great rapper one of my favorites but acting high school drama club at best. Great storyline Deniro is great as usual but hoky acting cancels all of that.
3,hmmm. .,this one was somewhat of an interesting plot. . but not memorable. Had an array of good actors in it.
2,Freelancers,I really didn't think the movie was all that. If you've seen one bad copy movie you have seen them all.
2,And,How much did they spend on making this?Seems to me that it's a bunch of unadulterated drivel.But I'll check it out at the library for free.
4,Action,"A good drama and action film staring Robert De Niro and Curtis Jackson or some may call him 50 Cent by his Hip-Hop Stage name, was a good cop bad cop film dealing with a corrupt police department in New York City."
1,Freelancers,Too violent and poor acting. I love Robert DeNero but lately the roles he has accepted have not shown his true acting ability.
3,Freelancers review,"I thought the movie was entertaining, but I was disappointed that Robert DeNiro didn't play a bigger role in the movie. I've been a fan of Robert DeNiro's for most of my life and I was hoping he had a greater role in this production. The action in the acting were very good, but because of the lack of Robert DeNiro's performance. I'm giving it a rating of three stars."
2,not that good,50 cent is not that good of an actor. Story was kind of ho hum. I did not like this flick that much. If you like cop movies with tons of violence with a tad of female nudity you may like this.
1,terrible,"confusing, noisy, unrealistic. too many characters introduced early on that having less would have made the movie less crappier. Poor use of De Niro. Maybe his skills are diminished, but he should not be taking these crappy type movies that without him in it would be direct to video or remove the swearing and cartoon violence could be a made for tv movie staring Angie Dickenson and Telly Selvellas. Save you time and money, do something else"
1,Way Bad!!!,Robert De Niro and Forrest Whitaker are two of my favorite actors but not even they could save this feeble/ predictable script. And to add insult to injury 50 cent is the main character. New rule: If singers/ rappers want to be on the big screen they should be able to act. I'm just sayin...
2,Great album - Wrong Lyrics!,"His vocals ... his music ... all is great! BUT, in his cover of ""One Tin Soldier"", he said the totally wrong lyrics and has changed the message of the story! Remember - in the 1st & 2nd verses, the mountain people have the treasure & the valley people ask for it, but the mountain people say they'll be glad to share it. Then the final verse should say ""then the VALLEY cried with anger, 'mount your horses, draw your swords' and they killed the MOUNTAIN people, so they won their just reward'"" Unfortumately, Bushman says ""then the mountain cried with anger ... and they killed the valley people"". That's not only backwards but it totally changes the message of the story! I can't believe that someone as good as Bushman would make such a mistake! I'm extremely disappointed."
4,Useful Guide for Managers Confronting Legal Constraints,"USING is a straight-forward, clearly written guide for managers who must consider legal constraints. Siedel presents a four point Manager's Legal Plan as a device for anticipating potential legal problems and then developing a plan of action in response. The unique value of this book is the manner in which it integrates a business perspective into legal risk analysis. Too often, books of this sort stick solely to a public policy analysis or a mind numbing survey of legal principles. Siedel uses interesting cses and examples to make his points. Some of his heuristics such as Fight versus Flight will stick in the minds of managers. Recommended for managers and MBA students.Thomas Dunfee, Professor of Legal Studies, The Wharton School"
3,A Literary Classic for Children,"El Cid tells the story of Castilian knight Rodrigo Diaz de Vivar. Born in a Medieval Spain ruled by the Moors, it tells of Rodrigo's disgrace from King Sancho's court and his tireless efforts to win the King's favor. He does this by repeatedly defeating the Moors and reclaiming territory for the crown. After ceaseless efforts, he becomes known as El Cid [or more specifically El Cid Compeador--""The Lord Master of Military Arts"".]The book is written for 'tweens and offers plentiful and colorful illustrations interwoven with large set type. This is a book that is made to be read aloud."
4,Gunk engine flush,"The gunk engine flush product is a decent product. I've tried both professional use and store bought products and noticed no noticeable difference. Of course I have not pulled a motor apart after extensive use to check clearances or anything. I go based on my own visable judgement. I think these are NOT miracle products but using them frequently on a 'as needed' basis can help. I use this primarily on my girlfriends 1996 Toyota Avalon. Which is just about to pass the 400,000 mi mark. Synthetic oil every 3500-4000 miles with this product when it slips our minds."
5,Gunk MF3 High Mileage Motor Flush - 32 fl. oz.,used this on all my cars with high mailes works great. no prb. my car has about 170thousand miles on it and still runs great
5,"Excellent reference guide, All inclusive","This is one of the first books I've read on cerebal palsy. It is the most excellent resource I've found thus far. It is factual, has many resources, pictures and little excerpts of parents real life thoughts on dealing with their child and their disability. Easy to read, not heart-breaking, but very encouraging. Helps you to realize there are many options out there and a lot of hope for your child."
1,This book is old information,This was the first book I bought when my grandson was diagnosed with spastic diplegia. I found no hope in it and continued looking until I found Advanced Bio-mechanical Rehabilition. Their web-site is www.blyum.com. We have been doing ABR for six months and the changes are miraculous. Finally something to actually help our kids physically instead of teaching them to deal with less and less movement as they age.
3,Don't get rooked,"This is a great strap, but the prices are what suck. Musicians Friend has them for 15.99. My local shop has them for 13.99. So shop around before you order. I can't honestly imagine spending more than 12 bucks on it. It's a gorgeous strap, but you can honestly get better quality ones without the pretty picture for less than ten dollars.Your paying for the picture, so make sure you absolutely love it before you drop your coin."
5,The Best Live Performance I Have Ever Heard!,"I have always been a big music fan and silverchair is my favorite band. I know sometimes when musicians have live concerts they dont sound as good as in the album, but in this case, silverchair has surpassed my expectations. The music is beautiful and melodic. Daniel Johns's voice is in tone, is pleasant to the ear, and strongly emotional. When he sings live, you can feel what he is feeling and the addition of the insturmentals make the whole experience awesome! The band changes the songs a little bit and I like that because they don't try to make it sound exactly like the album. BUY THIS DVD/CD COMBO, YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!"
3,Acceptable power source,"The first time I used it, I plugged my iPaq HW6515 overnight so it would be fully charged the next day. I didn't know it stopped charging after about 20 minutes. I was left with an almost dead phone the next day. There's a button on the USB cable, just make sure it is set so the LED is red. There is no documentation included, so I'm not even sure what this button does. I was a bit surprised to read a health warning on the label instructing to wash your hands after touching the product because it contains lead--not good.Another thing I did not like was that this is an HP supported product for the HW6515, but the charger doesn't fit as properly and securely as the one included with the PDA. Overall an acceptable product, now I am just waiting for HP to sell their own car adapters."
5,Can't stop using this awesome cream!,I feel like in the desert my skin has really been hit hard by the elements. This eye cream (and other line of products I am using from this company) has really turned my skin around! I admittedly had reasonably good skin to begin with but now I feel like my skin glows (and I have gotten compliments!). The area I keep an eye on the most -due to my age- is the eye area! This rich eye cream has really helped my eye area to look supple and less like a problem area!!!
2,Nothing Exceptional,"Mark Linley's views on positive thinking are good,but as for the sketches I didn't learn much more than I do just by teaching myself.It's very average in that there isn't that much to learn.And no way am I grabbing an egg and sticking plasticine nose and eyes on it.Bye!!"
4,Great features for reasonable price,"The photo frame can accept various memory cards, plays audio, video, and photos, has an internal memory of about 100mb, and has a remote control. Very reasonable price."
3,"7"" is ONLY 480x234 resolution","I got the impression from the reviews that this frame was 800x600 resolution. I should have known it was too good to be true, but I thought it was just on clearance. They actually make it VERY hard to find the resolution online for this model.Part of the idea of a digital picture frame is to look sharp, new, fresh, and high tech. 480x234 resolution DOES NOT look high tech, it just looks outdated. I am going to return mine and look for something better. I guess that is one of the downfalls of shopping online: you don't get to see it before you buy it. I read the reviews, but the reviews for the 7"" were mixed with reviews for other Aluratek frames that were other sizes... and that was not clear either."
1,Pass on this one,Most of the reviews I read for this Digital Photo Frame were good or better but I found it to be very difficult/impossible to set up and use. The instructions are a joke and the menu and function buttons are incredibly frustrating. I bought it as a gift but I'm going to return it... worse than useless!
4,Good Photo Frame,"For the price this frame has some good features. It has more internal memory then most frames, and it will let you connect directly to the PC to transfer pictures. The resolution is Good, but could be better. Like most frames the menu interface isn't very good, but I haven't seen one yet that is. It has a power on and off timer so you can set the time it should be on and when it will turn off. This is a nice feature if you are going to use it at work. Good frame for the price."
2,Disappointed,"I was quite disappointed with these frames. I bought three of them for family members for Christmas. I loaded them up with pictures and sent them off. I am a photographer and so I am quite familiar with photo quality. That was my main complaint with these frames. The photo quality was extremely poor and I know that the pictures that I was loading were crystal clear. I wasn't expecting perfection, but I thought it would be better than it was. The colors also were off also...too muted.If I would have had time to return them, I would have. I was, however, under the gun to get these out in time for Christams. I would suggest checking out the frame that you are interested in at a local retailer to see the picture quality. If you are happy with it, then go ahead and order it on-line if it's a better deal. I would not buy something like this again without seeing it in person first."
2,dmims,"Being a novice with digital frames, I found the directions with this product very confusing and the product was not very ""user"" friendly for me."
3,aluratek 7 inch pic frame,"i have had the item in use for a few days now, to navigate the menu and save pictures onto the onboard memory was difficult. the remote is chinsey and at one point it would not work, so i bought a new battery, it worked for a second then would not respond again, so i bought another battery and it did the same thing. then i put back in the old battery and it worked, my conclusion is that the remote does not make contact with the battery all the time. its an ok starter unit but if you are not on a budget spend a little more and get a better quality unit."
3,Not what I expected,"I guess after reading other reviews of this product, I expected a little more. Resolution was just ok. Getting around the menus is also a little cumbersome. I wish now that I had spent a little more money and got a larger frame with better resolution."
1,Don't buy this. Here are the deal breakers...,"First, the remote seems to not work at all. But even if it did, you do not want this frame for two reasons. It does not play the slideshow randomly (it only plays in the order the photos are loaded). But the kicker is this: there are three speeds for playing the slideshow. The fastest changes the picture every second, medium changes every three seconds, and the slowest changes every six seconds. What were they thinking? All three speeds are so fast that it'll drive you completely insane. Even at every six seconds the pictures change so rapidly that you barely get a glimpse of the image and then its gone. Do not buy this. Get one that plays randomly and allows the pictures to remain for at least a full minute, maybe even five minutes. Our other one allows for a minute, five minutes, even a half hour or hour. Trust me, after you've had one of these for a while, you won't want the images constantly changing. It's annoying and it's a distraction."
5,Works great.,"Bought this for a fathers / mothers day gift for my parents. They have been having fun loading pictures, seeing what all it will do."
2,Good But Not Great,"Bought the Aluratek 7-Inch Digital Photo Frame with 256MB (Black) for my Mother for Mother's Day. She loves it. I think it may be a little too complicated for the average user. It was easy to connect to PC and load pictures, but buttons on top don't work very well, and neither does the remote control."
3,Fairly good deal for the money.,"The Aluratek 7-inch digital frame is no great frame. However, it has decent resolution for the money. The remote control was a bit flaky and we often had to press the buttons multiple times to get it to work. I had problems figuring out how to start a slide show so I actually emailed tech support and they were able to help me fairly quickly. My biggest complaint is the remote control."
1,Bad bad bad...,"A few things really grind my gears about this purchase:1. Aweful long shipment time despite complaining to AMAZON customer service who never kept the promise.2. I was told if shipment could not make it on the date I want, AMAZON will refund me, BUT, AMAZON charged my credit card BEFORE the item arrive!3. WRONG shipment information on the webpage. When I first ordered it shows estimated arrival on 9th May, but after a few day it shows 15th May. This is CHEATING!4. Shipment was slow compared to other merchants. This one took 7 freakin' days to deliver!"
1,A very unfriendly approach to dog training,"Whereas Mr. Margolis has an abundance of video charisma WITH PEOPLE, his dog 'training methods' are VERY unfriendly. Why do dogs let him do this stuff? It's cruel."
1,"TOM BERENGER, WHAT WERE YOU THINKING ???","I purchased this video because i am a big fan of both Stephen Lang and Tom Berenger, both very interesting and creative actors...but to my horror, this is the worst piece of trash i have ever seen...and Berenger is not only the star, but the executive producer of this horror ! It is below the level of an Ed Wood film.....Stephen Lang is supposed to be a respected, world-renowned college professor, but he acts like a crazed porno star, and speaks with a "" trailor-park-trash "" accent.....i first saw this actor playing Hamlet in a Broadway production...boy, is his classical training going to waste here, I can only assume he was desparate for money....i can't come up with an excuse for Berenger."
2,"""womens"" watch??","I ended up having to give this watch to my husband (I bought it for myself). The face of the watch is what I expected, but the band is huge and I must have spent about an hour trying to adjust it, which was virtually impossible. I gave the watch to my husband - the band was too large for him (and he is six feet tall and medium build)! Being mechanically inclined, my husband also tried diligently to adjust the band, to no avail. So, overall the purchase was a waste of money due to the Fort Knox-like nature of the (non)""adjustable"" band."
4,5 books into one movie : nice try,"I couldn't agree more with the first review. I loved the books and how exited was I to find out that my yearly trip to Madrid (coolest city in Europe) meant I could see the movie I was waiting for over a year now !I loved it - however, too many battle scenes, not enough information on who, why and what and yes why is Angelica not blond ?? The end I found especially annoying... Viggo of course was fabulous - as always ;-)Well worth seeing but, reading the books first is a must.Manuela Rhea"
3,Questionning the Basis,"A really slow-motioned biographical picture on less known outside Spanish-speaking sphere historical figures of the pre-Rembrandt 17th century world, broadens viewer's knowledge with depicting a gloomy dangerous existence in absolute monarchy-ruled places outside more described then England/France, from a time perspective questions very grounds of a moral and ethics based on traditional values.Rather educative than entertaining work."
5,Luzianne Seafood Coating is the Best,"We once were able to buy Luzianne Seafood Coating at Kroger in Houston, but for some reason they discontinued it, and only offered another brand which is not good. We love Luzianne so much we order 12 boxes at a time from Amazon just so that we don't run out. Its delicious on fresh catfish and other fish as well. We also like the Luzianne Chicken Coating better than all the rest."
5,Perfect coating,"This is the easiest way to prepare fried fish ever. While fish is damp, just coat it with luziane and fry. It is delicious!"
3,"Decent album, with some nice surprises","Another decent album by ex and now current Maiden guitarist, Adrian Smith. However, I still think that ASaP was a better outlet for his solo career. Although that does not include the magic that Smith provided for Bruce Dickinson's later solo career. Anyway, the problem is once again a weak vocalist. The guitar tones are great, the band sounds great, perhaps a little forced, but the singer is not as good as Adrian Smith himself. I love the inclusion of not just fellow Maiden axe king Dave Murray, but also Scott Gorham of Thin Lizzy! If you are a Maiden fan, get this one, and then think about getting Psycho Motel's other one."
3,ok,"Bought two of these as gifts and they were happy with the camo of the white hat. Not that great of a material, will get""pulls"" if not careful."
1,Overpriced and disappointing,"Since the author touts himself as a descendant of Stanford White, one doesn't expect much in the way of critical perspective from the text of this book. More disappointing are the contemporary photographs - although reproduced at enormous size, they are oddly flat and lifeless. For a better book at a better price, check out ""The Architecture of McKim, Mead & White in Photographs, Plans and Elevations"""
3,powerpoint,"I ordered this so my son could use it for school, but he can't make it interface with the powerpoint 3 at school, so he's not using it. So, really can't give it an accurate review."
2,Gates doesn't care to help upgrade buyers,"Bill Gates does it again when he does not allow a former or earlier version of his software programs to interface or 'communicate' with a newer version. He has done this multiple times. EXAMPLE: He created versions of MS Publisher that do not open previous work done with a different version.Why would anyone in their right mind want to create projects or designs with one version of Power Point and then thinking to upgrade (that one would think would have greater capabilities on your work)...instead to find that all your previous work is no longer viewable or workable on the new version? What a huge waste of time!Want a clue...go to Apple and a Mac. With the student versions available to buy at huge discounts on software, and good interface and not having to fight with VISTA junk, and no interface between version updates with the more creative software of Microsoft...all Gates has done is drive us all elsewhere with his insensitivity."
4,Decent,"It is a decent product for home or student. Lacks some of the heavy duty elements needed for high level presentations, but if you don't need that, this is the product you want."
1,Another Microsoft bummer ! ! ! !,"Like Microsofts' Vista, this software is all hookum and no substances. There is no improvement over the previous Powerpoint 2003 program, which is what I hoped to find. In fact, the menu screens appear to be the only change and they have been made much harder to intuit and use.After a few days of trying this program, I gave it away to the Public Library."
5,For all Glen Yarbrough/Rod McKuen Fans,"Soft, easy, sad. All the hallmarks of Glen at his best without the snaps and pops of my well worn vinyl copy. Close your eyes and drift back to the other times."
5,A classic in every way,I first heard this collection of songs in 1965 while in college. Yarborough has to have one of the all time unique and distinctive voices. Combine that with the poetics of McKuen and it makes for a wonderfully rich auditory experience. Simply superb.
5,This is one funny book!,"My partner and I bought this book for a seven year old boy... unfortunately, we kept it for ourselves and he got something else! We read it in the store and laughed and laughed, then took it home and read it a few more times, then it ended up on our bookshelf. But now that I've found it here at Amazon, we'll be ordering more copies for all the kids in our lives. The story is VERY loosely based on Kafka's ""Metamorphosis""... a boy wakes up one morning to find that he is a bug. No one seems to notice, except for his best friend, who is quite concerned. Don't worry though, it all works out okay. The drawings are great and the text is fun for kids... and obviously for adults as well!"
3,Beetle Boy,The book Beetle Boy by Lawrence David and Delphine Durand is about Gregory Sampson waking up as a Ground Beetle. Find out what happens in Beetle Boy.
4,very interesting insight into corporate america,"A MUST READ FOR THE LIBERAL ANTI CORPORATE OUT THERE. AN EXTREMELY WELL RESEARCHED AND THOUGHTFUL ANALYSIS OF AMERICA AND ITS 200 PLUS YEAR HISTORY. THE BOOK IS A LITTLE BIT ONE SIDED ON THE DARK AND DREARY PARTS OF CORPORATE AMERICA AND OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM, BUT REALLY GETS YOU THINKING."
1,"Bad ideas, cleverly written","Gery Spence's ideas would turn these united States into a socialist dystopia. His ideas are anathema to liberty.Example: That Congress shall make no law abridging freedom of speech is set in the First Amendment. We can be certain that the founders meant political speech.Spence's solution: Eliminate campaign contributions, so that only thos who control a TV network or newspaper chain can influence the outcome of an election. While he rails against the big corporation, this one proposal gives unprecedented power to a small sub-group of corporations.Whether you believe that socialists or social conservatives control the media, this effectively silences those with opposing views. Stalin and Hitler would be proud of such an idea - and to couch it in the name of freedom is obscene."
2,Read the Books,"The first 2/3 of this DVD are quite good, though there are major scenes from the books that get only cursory ""check the box"" treatment here. That's largely the problem with this--it makes a valiant effort, but I think ultimately fails in capturing the depth and hugely comedic nature of these books. The last portion of the film--after the war-- is quite disappointing--a different actor now plays the narrator & some of the characters appear to have aged dramatically (at least one with very bad makeup) while others haven't aged at all. Bad choice. Unfortunately, I can't recommend this set of DVD's because the last portion of the film is so bad."
4,Left Wanting More!!!!,"I'm not even finished watching the series. I am halfway through the 3rd DVD, but since the first one I've been left feeling cheated. Definitely I see how it has been compared to Brideshead Revisited, but this one is just a tease when it finishes each Part. Each time I finish watching Brideshead I'm satisfied. Watching each Part of Dance is like getting a basic outline without any filled in information, unsatisfying - I'm left hanging. Thank goodness they included a ""cheat sheet"", but I'm still having a slight problem figuring out who each character is and where they fit in.After reading other reviews, I really dread coming to the part where Nick ages and they replace him with another actor. What a bummer!!"
1,A Dance to the Music of Time,"Spoiler....Disc 1-3 was excellent, HOWEVER, I was so disappointed to see that the actors did not age with the part, but the DIRECTORS REPLACED the main actors altogether. Make sure you get this fact into your head before you buy this series. In fact, I am sorry I bought it, and I wish I could throw it in the trash.I will not share this series with friends of mine that I pass along my DVDs to, who appreciate my collection of BBC Period TV series/movies. There are much better one in my collection to share. Monarch of the Glen and House of Elliott, Wives & Daughters and a ton of others. I don't want them to be disappointed and angry like I me!And I hardly ever bother sharing my opinion with others, buy you tell I feel very strongly about this series. I wish I would have read and checked out this series before I bought it. Some people like everything!"
5,Nostalgic,"It is just as expected. If this part of history interests you, this is a wonderful, romantic period piece that includes the development of a character disorder in one role, and a general examination of relationships and their growth through the years."
5,great battery,I have this battery in a Hot Dog Cart to run a 12v pump for Hot water. It holds power very well. I charge it every three days and have had no problems.
3,Check list type book,The good thing about this book is that it offers a step by step explanation of what to do to find and negotiates with sponsors. Nothing earth shattering here but it nice to have a check list to work on to make sure you are doing the job properly.
1,Not for everyone,"If you are a mountain bike racer who knows little to nothing about sponsorship, you'll be fascinated by this book. If you are not, you'll be disappointed. Not being the former, I am the latter."
1,WARNING!!!!,"Well, I took the time to ask the store associates about this product but that was a waste because the kid didn't know anything about it and couldn't answer one of my questions. So I took a chance and bought it anyway. Big mistake. This product DOES NOT WORK on ALL PS2 systems. I put the disc in and it just came up as a ""Disc read error"". I have a regular version of the PS2 ( not a slim one ) and it will NOT work on my system, yet the game stores sell this product with no warning. I called the Codebreaker manufacturer and they explained to me that it will not work on every PS2 system. If you do buy this, save the receipt."
5,Works Great even on the PS3,This product has worked great for me and if any one was curious it does work on the PS3 for your PS2 games.
5,overpriced,"i think that these products are waaayyy overpriced, they are made for outdated systems that not many people play anymore, and you can get this for FREE if you download it properly, i would pay $20.00 for this"
1,Be Aware of which Version you're getting,Be Aware of which Version you're getting as there are many from version 1 to 9.2. i have seen some for sale supposedly version 10 and 10.1. but what i ended up getting was a version 1 and not a version 4 as seller had stated. and when seller was contacted they werent aware there was any other versions available. the games we were trying to break into werent included on version 1 and we havent been successful to manually break into those games.from what I've been able to determine is that it takes a higher version to get into the games we want.
3,Codebreaker,"Vey nice cheats cd working great on ps2 , but if you are going to use it on the ps3 its not a good choice it doesnt work"
1,Corrupted Save Game Files,"To start off with, I will say that at first, this product seemed great. I beat FFX-2 within 20 hours, and had started on Grand Theft Auto when the game froze up. I took my playstation into a game repair shop, only for them to claim it was fine. The game was in mint condition; only the save files on the memory stick that I had used cheats on continued to freeze when attempting to load. The cheat codes had corrupted my saves, and I had to start the game all the way over. Needless to say, I was very dissapointed in this product."
1,THE PRODUCT ARRIVED ON TIME BUT IT DIDN'T WORK,"I received the Codebreaker Disc on time, but Pelican Accessories doesn't notice that there are two versions of Codebraker Disc, one from China and another from United States.The Chinese version that I bought them didn't work for my PS2 slim. In other words, I threw my money to the trash can... :-("
4,I dont like costume drama but this was great.,"Normally I hate anything that looks like costume drama but this film was way cool. Billy Connoly was excellent, hope he does more movies. The script is terrific. All the acting was first class. I expected this to be stuffy Victorian drama but was really surprised."
3,Subtitles ?,The movie itself is very good. However this copy of it is not!No setup and subtitles that are very distracting and can not be removed !Why are we not warned of this before purchase ? I would have gladly spenttwice as much for a good copy of this movie !
5,Behind the facts of history,Buy it. You will not be sorry. A different view of Queen Victoria - the 'mother' of most European royals pre World War I.
1,Who put subtitles on what was once one of my husband and my favorite movies?,Do not buy this version of Mrs. Brown. We owned the VHS version and have also watched it on Netflix over the years and finally decided to replace it in DVD format. The seller-Out of This World-or whomever-have completely ruined it. The DVD looks like what we would presume was a pirated copy. This is something we would not expect Amazon to carry. My husband remarked that the subtitles are so strange it seems as if it was for a hearing impaired person-since the movie is in English and the subtitles are in English-but that isn't the strangest part: there are subtitles telling you someone is clearing their throat; or a clock is ticking; or there is a clap of thunder! This is beyond annoying and you cannot remove the subtitles. This copy will go into the trash-it isn't worth the cost of returning it to Amazon. We highly recommend the movie Mrs Brown-but not this version-so get the real thing elsewhere and enjoy!
4,Movie was Outstanding but the editing was awful,Judi Dench is a queen no matter what role she plays. She is always delightful.Billy Connolly was masterful in the role of Brown. If you are looking for his styleof comedy it isn't here. I would love to see Mr Connolly in other serious roles.The movie was well done. My complaint would be the editing for the dvd copy. Very sadly done.Some of the sweetest parts are on the cutting room floor. It is a shame that this has to be done for dvds.
3,Excellent costume/sets - but a Boring Story,"The costume and set designers for this period piece should win awards for their designs. Dame Judi Dench was a rather gruff Queen Victoria, and Billy Connolly was adequate as John Brown. Overall, the story line was executed in a most detailed, slow and boring fashion which tarnished this otherwise gem of a film."
3,Mrs. Brown,"I was very disappointed in this movie. I would not watch it again unless I wanted to see the lovely landscapes and very good sets and costumes. The story could certainly have more interest if the dialogue was not so bad. It showed Victoria in her extream depressive and overbearing state in the long, long mourning for her husband and I don't doubt that everyone around her, children included, were made as miserable as she was. I suppose Judi Dench did the best she could, but there was no comic relief at all. Billy Connolly, again, did as well as he could with the material at hand. I, for one, would not have blamed the Queen for ""misbehaving"", but could they not have put a little humor in it?? No, can't say I would advise anyone buying it."
1,Not Happy,"I received this DVD but it's sub titled, which I did not ask for. Everything that is said by the characters is written on the bottom of the screen, which is very distracting. Cannot concentrate on movie because of the sub title written on the bottom. Very unhappy. Cannot even stand to watch the movie."
1,Bootleg; Don't bother with this seller,Awful bootleg copy; Subtitles + Only two selections on the DVD menu page - PLAY & CHAPTERS. Quality is fine but doesn't make up for the fact there are constant subtitles and the inability to fast forward or rewind shorter than a scene/frame. Really? I would have expected more for half the price of a brand new copy.
3,far too deferential,"The problem is that this film, like the victorian age characters it involves, is too reserved to take a stand. The friendship is portrayed as platonic, but maybe, just maybe -- something more. In the end, you wish it HAD been portrayed as something more, because that what the film needs."
1,Judi Dench,"I going to make it quick and succint... Why oh why are movies like this made??? such a waste of talent and money.... O.K. we get it Queen Victoria is broken hearted at the death of here husband.Then this noble man comes to her rescue to try to get her out of her gloom... Lord have mercy, bored is, well there just isn't a word in the english language to conveys how utterly stupid thischeaply made costume drama is. Don't waste your time... As Evelyn said on 2-1/2 men when Jake tried to explain Sponge Bob Square Pants... No. Life is just to short."
1,Just dont waste your time or money,"How can you say Boring quickly? Borrring! Terrible. Billy connelly was the light in the film. Judy Dench was good in her role, but her role seems the same in every film you ever see with her. Gerard Butler, well um, it was interesting the jumping in the water scene. Every little bit, yet seemed excited to be in a film. The writing was so, so and the acting not so good. As for the historical significance, it was a bit murky."
2,boring,"Pretty boring movie. Finding out that the ""journal"" had been ""lost"" made it heresay, though. The 2 top actors were the only thing that kept me from turning the movie off."
3,Mrs. Brown,"I enjoyed this film because it is a period piece, and it is based on a true story with which I was unfamiliar. The film was very well done and the acting -- particularly that of Judi Dench -- was excellent."
4,Mrs. Brown...,"I finally caught this movie on Cable. Very well done, very well acted. I'm going to get my copy. The only reason why I didn't give this movie the five stars that it deserves is for the following (significant in my eyes) reason:Upon the death of Her majesty, she had, by her request, buried with her, in her hand, a locket that beared the picture of a certain Mr. Brown! I found about this some time back by watching a story of Queen Victoria and Mr. Brown on (I believe) the History Channel! A detail like that should have been shared with the movie audience - but it wasn't! Most unfortunate!On a lighter note - when Mr. Brown referred to his sovereign as ""Woman,"" that just cracked me up! Still, it is an excellent film, and I recommend it to all - Four stars!!"
2,So Disappointed,"I'll make this short and sweet. This film is one of the best period works that I've ever seen. However, I've seen it both in the regular DVD format and in the Blu-Ray format. I purchased the Blu-Ray recently and was appalled at the quality of the picture. Very very grainy. Believe me when I say that you will be much happier with the regular DVD format."
2,Snooze,"Another British film that practically put me to sleep. I love costume dramas and British film. Too bad this was not a worthy watcher. Good acting, but slow."
3,price,it's too expensive considering the manufacturing cost. it would be less than a quarter . i want you not to charge too much
3,Serves the basic purpose,"I am a law student and this holds very large, heavy books. That's good. Adjustable? Not really. I would like to be able to manipulate the angle, and this doesn't allow for it. For the price it's fine."
4,Excellent book stand,Great product. Holds up giant anatomy books with ease! The book stand is also great for tablets as well. The foldable design helps save space for toting to and from school/wherever you need to be.
5,Great little book holder,"I bought one for myself and everybody that sees it loves it. I love it too. It's very light and easy to carry around. I like mine so much, I bought extra ones to give as Christmas present to my mom and other family members."
3,"Works well, but a bit flimsy","I carried around my book holder in my backpack for two years, and it always performed its task well. Eventually, the strain on the plastic pieces was too much and one of them cracked through. Then I realized that the metal does not go all the way through the plastic guides, so when it cracks it loses all structural integrity and the book holder is useless. Now I'll be looking for a studier, all-metal book holder that won't break so easily."
4,"Not a great bookholder, but an awesome laptop stand","Although this book holder looks simple--my first impression was that it looked like a bent wire hanger--don't be deceived: it is a versatile piece. Although I did have some trouble using the book holder for some of my larger textbooks (the stand was prone to tipping, and changing pages was difficult), I found an alternate use for it as a laptop stand. It has held up for nearly two years now, and works like a charm in that capacity."
3,wrong description,"I bought this book holder after reading good reviews, but it is really not so good. Mighty Bright writes in the product description 'Variable slope Adjustments (it really adjusts)', but the fact is that it does not. It has one fixed slope. I sent a email to Mighty Bright, who is the seller and probably the manufacturer of this product to explain me how I can adjust the slope, if it really does, as he says. It has been several weeks by now, but I have not received any response. Another drawback is that the wires are soft and pliable and tend to bend with the weight of a hardcover high school textbook. It seems that soon it is going to be out of shape. Yes, one good thing is that it does fold, so it is easily portable."
2,Not recommended!,"It can barely hold light notebooks, and it easily falls down with any normal sized book. Also it has no stability. Not good :-("
4,Very Good book stand,"Supports most of my books well, even the huge science textbooks. Makes reading a lot easier. For those who have complained about its inability to support large books, u need to adjust it well for best fit. One con is that it is difficult to flip pages on a 1000page book. Highly recommended."
1,It is basically just a coat hanger,"I'm very disappointed in this device. It's basically just a coat hanger with two plastic guides. The only thing it has going for it is portability. It can only hold regular sized hard covered books. Forget about any size paperback, it will not work. Even hard cover books are nearly impossible to align correctly and they slip and slump in all kinds of odd positions. Then you have to completely remove the book from the stand every time you need to turn a page and try to realign it all over again. I tried with over 10 textbooks and it didn't do well with any of them. For home reading I'm going to buy and suggest you buy a more substantial stand. The only reason to keep it is to slip in a backpack and take with you and hope you have the desk space wherever you take it to use it."
2,Not quite right,"I purchased this item to help ensure correct posture while reading and typing up notes. While it may serve for 'lite' reading, I found it to be cumbersome for larger books. It is cumbersome because it does not have the 'handles' that should hold the bottom of each side of the open book are not adjustable. The inability to adjust the 'handles' makes it difficult - if not impossible - for the unit to hold thick books that are opened such that an equal (and substantial) number of pages are being 'held' by each 'handle.'"
2,Not what I was looking for,"This product didn't meet the expectations I had after reading the product details and all the customer reviews. It holds regular hard-cover textbooks pretty well, but I have 2 wire bound textbooks that it doesn't support. Also its very inconvenient to turn pages (you pretty much have to take the book off the stand, turn the page, and then put it back in the stand), regardless of what kind of book you are using, which really defeats the purpose for me because I normally don't just stay on the same page.However, it does fold nicely and comes with a little sleeve that is hole punched so you can carry it around in a binder. I thought that was cool."
5,Does what it should.,"Holds up books and saves strain on your neck. I have had it for about 6 months now, and haven't found a book too small or too large. I'm in law school and it holds my constitutional law textbook, about 1400 pages and really heavy, with no problem. The little flares on the ends are nice for keeping the pages flat when you're reading."
1,flimsy holder,I bought this product because the book stand I have now is too narrow to hold my textbooks. But this product is so cheaply made that it can't even withstand the weight of my text book...what a waste of 9 dollars.
5,Deceptively sturdy,"This has been a lifesaver and a great purchase for the money. I bought this while searching for a way to prevent neck/back strain from spending hours a day studying (""studying injury"" lol). Out of the box it seems like it's flimsy and wouldn't be able to support any kind of weight, but once my huge calculus and physics books are on there it's solid and sturdy. It doesn't work as well with paperbacks and it's not meant for small books. For huge hardcover texts it's great though!"
5,BEST EVER!!!!!!!,This is the best ever. It is holding my organic chem 1200+ paperback book as I type this review. This thing is amazing!!!! Highly recommend
5,What a Relief: The Best Book Stand Ever is Back Home,"I owned one of these for years, after test-driving a variety of other stands. Then we moved. I lost it. Crippling. I tried to find it in stores. Failure. I finally occurred to me that I might be able to buy it online. I had it in days, much earlier than promised. It's sturdy, foldable, slim, droppable, adaptable even to the big fat books on American History and the Constitution to which I am addicted. Joy."
5,Book holder,"Exactly described, Stainless steel book holder. Very Sturdy and the price was exceptional. Very satisfied customer. Would certainly recommend. If the company sold a larger size I would also purchase it. Folding makes it convenient to stow away. I give A+++++++ and shipping also was fast."
4,Useful for School,This product is best for hard covered books; it doesn't work well with paperbacks. Very useful for when I need to do math problems. I love the travel pouch it comes in.
3,Not good for paperback,"This book holder is perfect for books with hardcovers only. If you plan to use it with a paper back, get one that has better supports."
3,"Great music, pointless lp transfer","Another transfer of an lp of early 1950s recordings on TK gives us only one tango not presented on their other releases, the title track Don Juan - and this spoilt by pitch wobble on the LP. Try ""Sus Mejores Momentos"" instead."
5,Great book for lovers of Mexicana souvenirs,"A whimsical and colorful book that has fancy fiesta ideas for turning Mexican and other kinds of Latin trinkets into impressive decorations. I highy reccommend this book along with the author's other one on Mexican crafts. I collect Mexican design books, and I've never seen anything like these books. I'm intrigued at the clever presentation of making your own items from memoribilia. Now I hope to give it a try soon."
2,Great - if you aren't a Northerner,"I bought this book, full of excitement. When it arrived, I was sadly disappointed. The book, although bright and colourful, is of little use. Most of the projects in the book require items specific to regions of the culture outlined (and relatively unavailable elsewhere), and often are things such as ""buy this item and hang it like this"". Other projects were quite campy and almost gaudy (the wrestlers' come to mind). Granted, I am in Canada, so perhaps I can't totally appreciate all it has to offer, but having studied Latin culture and interior design, I didn't feel this book correctly conveyed projects that were accessible to the average person. Furthermore, the common thread through the book was ""be creative and make up your own stuff"", albeit decent advice, one usually purchases a book in order to replicate projects or ideas outline with in."
2,Just not for me,"After reading the reviews from the other users, and looking at the price, I decided to try this product out. At first, it seemed to be doing fine, but after about a week of using it, I didn't notice any difference in my hair. Also, that great smell started making me nauseous.I'm sure for most people it would do well and I like classic products such as these, but I guess it didn't work out for me.If you're curious about this product, give it a shot. It won't cost you an arm-and-a-leg and you can see whether it works for you."
5,Remember those three little words......,"When I lived in Hawaii I spent a lot of time in the water. After awhile I noticed my shampoo and conditioner just simply didn't answer for the problem, then one of my friends told me about Three Flowers Brilliantine.I use it every day. It's non -greasy and talk about help for split ends! Three Flowers returned the shine and managability to my hair.Remember....Just a little goes a long long way...for healthy hair that shines like it never did before ...Just remember those three little words...Three- Flowers - Brilliantine....Paula Kate Prince-Meserole"
2,Paste is better!,Product arrived considerably later than other items I had ordered. I applied it to my wet hair afer showering and disliked it immediately! It's heavy and barely scented. The scent itself lasts only minutes. The paste is much lighter on my hair and its scent lasts for hours! Wet your palm before adding the paste (tiny dab) and then rub in. Holds well and smells fresh and healthy.
4,A very enjoyable soup,"I definitely consider these soups to be over priced but this soup is extremely tasty and well worth the Amazon price after their additional special sale is also deducted. The problem with most canned soups, and this is absolutely no exception, is that the salt content of one can fulfills 100% of every individual's daily requirement of sodium. And they don't even use Sea Salt or other more natural salts instead of the artificially man made damaging chemically altered salt. I know that this salt makes up a good portion of the volume and weight of each can but it is killing our society and should be replaced and eliminated. Someone must know how to 'can' a tasty, lower, good salt soup?"
5,All-Star Front Line,"You just can't beat this sound and feeling. Art Farmer and Gigi Gryce are a perfect match. They are an ideal tonal and stylistic compliment to each other, and conceptually are so in their element on ""Farmer Met Gryce"".""A Night At Tony's"" gives a great example of the essence of Gigi Gryce's composition and outlook on music - brilliantly jubilant, direct, innovative and yet not beyond the ear's reach. ""Blue Lights"" is a delightful minor blues; fans of ""Blues and the Abstract Truth"" should check that out. ""The Infant's Song"" is a wonderful show of arranging techinque - Gigi Gryce's counterline doesn't interfere with the tender melody played by Art Farmer - a difficult feat at a slow, exposed tempo. A must-listen for any alto/trumpet frontline."
5,You Like Jazz? Then You Should Pick This One Up Now!,"""When Farmer Met Gryce"" is the classic pairing of two astounding jazz masters: trumpeter Art Farmer and alto saxophonist/composer Gigi Gryce. They are backed either by Horace Silver or Freddie Redd on piano, Percy Heath on bass, and Art Taylor or Kenny Clarke on drums. This is bebop at it's finest played by some of the best in business. You won't be disappointed if you dig bebop. Highly recommended.Special recommendations if you dig this recording: ""The Art Farmer Quintet (featuring Gigi Gryce), ""Gigi Gryce And The Jazz Lab Quintet,"" and anything that involved Gigi Gryce. This alto saxophonist/composer didn't stay on the jazz scene that long, but he his body of work is remarkable."
3,Cheap Material,"I was looking for outdoor birthday party supplies. This 10' parachute was an excellent choice for city/apartment living. It would be ""more fun"" with a larger size outdoors, but the children adjust accordingly :) The material wasn't labeled, so I'm not sure exactly what it was made of, but it doesn't say machine washable. It felt ""waterproof"" so I would assume it could be cleaned by wiping with a cloth? There were no instructions for cleaning. Lastly, I worry it will tear on concrete (city-living). Overall, I haven't found a 10' play parachute for under $25, and this one was $20 at the time, so, for the price, it was better than buying a pinata for the party because we can use it over and over again."
5,Timeless Game!,"Every night our two-year-old says. ""Build"" - it's the blocks. We make doors, bridges and towers. She loves them and it's really helping with her manual dexterity. She's also starting to pay attention to balance and the different shapes and colors. Always a good idea!"
2,Is what you would expect for $2.35,"Copy I received does not include ""The Glove"", but has the classic and laughably awful ""Pieces"" instead. The sound in ""Craze"" is inaudible."
2,Don't Bother,"If you are thinking of being suckered into buying this, don't bother.The sound and print quality are execrable. This is a real no-no."
1,disappointment,"According to the review, this was supposed to be an all natural pill to help with cholesterol. Well it didn't do it's job at all... in fact I am back on Crestor again just to get my cholesterol in check. I do not recommend this product at all."
5,genius,"if you are interested in understanding the mind, brain or sciences, you must read this book. it's pivotal to our understanding of consciousness and mind. deeply insightful and inspiring. opens new grounds for investivation, research and understanding.i must say though- that i read this book in summer 2003 and the impression left was powerful. one of the greatest brain books."
3,The Science of Writing Over Your Knowledge,"Damasio has clearly mastered the art of big words and antiquated phrases to explain that which he couldn't explain in plain English. I think that if he had left the thesaurus alone instead of trying to write this book as though he were writing to college professors, I would have enjoyed it more.I don't think of myself as a dummy by any means, yet I felt I had to keep looking up words or presuming their meaning as I read his book."
2,Poorly written,"I studied the topic of consciousness for a biopsychology course, and this book served as my main resource. I enjoyed Damasio's model of consciousness, but it was a painful read. He regularly uses ineffective analogies to classical music and other high-brow topics. Worse, he stretches the information out over 400 pages, despite having written a 25-page review article on the very same subjects. Save yourself a lot of time, and just read that article:Parvizi J., Damasio A. Consciousness and the brainstem (2001) Cognition, 79 (1-2), pp. 135-160."
5,The Feeling of What Happens is Extraordinary!,"I've read The Feeling of What Happens several time over -- it's extraordinary. Ledoux's Emotional Brain use to be my ""most important book ever written."" Now this one is. These guys really are getting to the essence of who/what/why we humans are. Maybe in time to save the species.That emotion and consciousness are not separable and that origin of self comes from a representation of the body via body signals/emotions/feelings is almost obvious/intuitive now that I've read Damasio's book. He biologically/scientifically (and convincingly) explains consciousness without getting bogged down in the qualia/quantum theory mumbo jumbo.All psychotherapists/counselors should/must read this book. But most of them are too ignorant of the biology of emotions and consciousness, relying instead on the Holy Scriptures of cognitive therapy, to appreciate this book's importance.A must read for any one who is reasonably conscious. Phenomenal book. Thanks Damasio"
2,Old Wine in Old Skins,"Everybody knows that Damasio is brilliant, just ask him. His most recent book has many interesting ideas, but this particular volume counts heavily on previously recorded case histories of his (as far back as the early 80s) and other peoples work (as far back as the 19th century) for which he takes too much contemporary credit. 75% of content is already known to neuroscientists. The writing is too convoluted to be readable by my mother-in-law. Non-neuroscientists with BA degrees or higher and a philosophical inclination are likely to like the book best."
5,Live music from a hillbilly legend,"Cool and calm, guitarist Merle Travis picks out a smooth blues riff, as he eases his way into the comedy song, ""That's All""... This playful opening track is a good indicator for the high level of musicianship and breadth of styles that Travis tackled in his postwar heyday. The album also includes various hick hits of the day, mainly a bunch of hillbilly boogie tunes and the sweet instrumental guitar numbers that Travis was famous for. The tracks on this disc are drawn from radio appearances Travis did while working as one of LA's most popular Hollywood hillbillies, while helping to revamp the sound of postwar country music. The sound quality is very good, and the snippets of dialog and live asides are a great glimpse into what live entertainment was like before TV was king... especially the rare, charming flubs and the constant tripping over each other's lines. They don't let the human factor into show biz like that anymore! Highly recommended."
1,Damages the nail bed! Nails turned blue!,"I had this on my nails for 3 days when they started to really hurt and turn blue. When I took the polish off, my nails looked bruised. It felt like needles had punctured the nail bed. I do think the product is so heavy it cuts off all circulation and oxygen to the nails. My nails are on the thin side, so perhaps that is why I had that reaction, but I assume most people using this product have thin nails. Use with caution!!"
5,Best product I've found for damaged nails,I purchased this a couple years ago when I was having some trouble during dry winter months with my fingernails. They were breaking easily and just didn't seem healthy. This product really helped them to look better. Then for a couple years I wore acrylic nails. I just recently decided to give my nails a rest from the acrylics and was quite shocked to realize how much damage they did to my nails. I knew immediately what to buy. I once again bought this item and it is bringing back the health of my nails. It provides a shine while it heals and protects.
5,Best Nail Product Ever!!,"This product is the best thing out there for peeling, cracking, chipping, splitting, or anything else that affects nails. It is unbelievable. I have been using it for two years and it started working immediately. I have recommended it two many of my friends and they all are using it and think it is great. I tried everything on the internet before this. Now I am completely happy."
5,"Good bye cracked nails, hello sexy lady fingers!!!","My nails broke if the wind blows seriously! I never had naturally long nails. They break almost everyday when I do mundane things like opening a door, or cooking, or taking a shower! Yes, my nails don't discriminate, they break all the time, everywhere I am. I had pretty much given up on it, until my dear friend raved about Rejuvacote. She actually bought me my first bottle and I started using it, and I have NO PAIN. I see some other review where the person has pain, but I am gathering that having years of acrylic tips, it must have damaged the nails so much that anything just painted on now without the acryllic will cause pain. I rarely got tips, too much upkeep and maintenance. But this bottle does the same thing as gettin fake tips and you can be proud to show off your hands. This is a must buy item!!! Be sure to put on a coat every day for it to work right!! :)"
5,AWESOME!,"This stuff is THE BEST! I have never been able to grow my nails...I have paid almost $20.00 for OPI nail strengthener with no results! I put Duri on right after taking acrylics off with no problems. I know some people experienced pain but I didn't have any, fortunately. Get this, trust me, you won't regret it!"
1,Does not work,"This product does not work. My nails did grow a little but then would split and easy break off. Not to mention the brown spots that developed under my nails. It looked like under my nails were bleeding and then the blood dried. My nails started to hurt after about a week.In addition, I had to reapply it several times a day as it kept coming off. I definately would not recommend this product."
4,Good product,"I have been trying this product only for 10 days. For the moment my nails look and feel stronger. They say you have to use it every day and after 7 days take it out and start again, but I had to change it after 4 or 5 days because it started peeling"
3,"depends on metabolism, medications peels off too fast","I was very excited about adding Duri Rejuvacote Nail Growth System to my new regimen. Perhaps it depends on one's metabolism, or even (allergy) medications, but I find it peels off very, very quickly, same day it's applied. I try to wear gloves when using cleansers and cleaning. My nails are growing and growing very fast, thanks to a nail strengthener oil and nail growth oil on [...]. I've seen tremendous growth! Nails that had never grown without artificial wraps or such are now growing long and strong. When a nail breaks, it grows back very quickly. So, I incorporated the Rejuvacote to help, but it peels off around the edges too quickly, even without pre-applying oils. I will use the remainder of the bottle, but would not buy again. For me, Sally Hansen works better. It helps the polish last longer, does not peel with mere handwashing and looks nice."
5,Great Product,"I have spent hundreds of dollars on nail products that were supposed do what this one does. It's amazing, I haven't had one nail spit or break since I started using it about a month ago.Ladies, it is the best!!!"
1,It's just cheap clear nailpolish! (:(,"#1. It has FARMALDEHUYDE ! Per WebMD: ""Elle, a celebrity manicurist who writes a blog for Barielle Cosmetics, suggests her clients use polish that is free of formaldehyde, toluene, and dibutyl phthalate.""#2. How on earth does putting this on top of the nailpolish penetrate the nailpolish to strengthen the nail under it?! It doesn't! That just goes to prove that it's the many layers that keep the nails from breaking and not that it's actually doing something to nourish the nails so that NAILS themselves become stronger.I was shocked when i put it on to see that it's basically just clear nail polish and not something that penetrates the nail it's self to strengthen it! It's just a cheap nailpolish which starts chipping off within 1 day (even when put on clean dry nails as the directions say!)."
2,Duri Cosmetics Rejuvacote 0.61oz,"I never heard of this product until I saw someone on youtube use it & she recommended it. So I tried it. After for using it for a week, I noticed that my nails kept breaking. It never happened to me before when I used other products. So I stopped using Rejuvacote."
5,It works!,I have been using this product for about a month now and it is the best product I have ever used! I have tried about eveything out there to grow my brittle nails and this product is amazing! My nails are stronger than they have ever been!
4,Great Product,"My best friend from France recommended this product-I don't know how she discovered this- but it really works. After taking off artificial nails many times and coming back to them because I could not grow nice nails, I tried it again, using Rejuvacote, and, now, 1 month after, I can honestly say that my nails are hard and are growing nicely."
2,Couldn't endure the pain...,"I tried this after removing acrylic nails because of the terrific reviews. About 5 min after applying, my nail beds began to burn with intense discomfort. I thought this was just the product working, but the discomfort increased to PAIN and I finally had to remove the polish. Noticed red marks on the nail bed almost like the skin underneath was getting a chemical burn or something. I could not tolerate this product. A few days later I tried it as just a topcoat over normal polish, thinking my nails were just too thin from acrylic damage. Same reaction; about 5 min later intense burning began. Maybe it was because my nails were damaged from the acrylics, but isn't that what this is advertised for? Since my experience, I have read other reviews of others having the same experience. I know it works great for most, but for some of us we have a reaction to something in this. I stick with Nail Aid now; no pain and good results."
4,Very good,"I have very weak and peeling nails and after 2 months using it every day (almost) they had became lot better. It doen't make your nails grow like crazy but makes them beautiful and strong. It doen't hurt unless you have very weak nails which is completely normal, in that case you should only apply it to the tips of the nail for like a week or so.Pros:Dry fast on nailsLong lasting cause is very liquid (not as quimica alemana which is good but you only get to use half bottle before it gets thick)Good priceDoesn't change your nail polish colorSimple because is just one stepCons:I think it makes your polish chip faster when used as base coatCouldn't be wear alone because it peels fastI'll buy this again and again :D"
3,be aware Tila seeds can be challenging,"Tilia can be quite challenging to germinate, so be cogiznant of this fact when looking at seeds:Basswood seeds show a pronounced dormancy and generally germinate poorly regardless of seedbed conditions. The primary cause for the lack of quick germination is an impermeable testa. Using organic acids to digest the pericarps of the fruits and to render the testas permeable improves germination. Correctly treated seeds commonly average from 20 to 30 percent germination following stratification at 2 to 5 C (36 to 41 F) for 110 to 130 days. Germination is epigeal. Early harvesting followed by immediate sowing has also been suggested for overcoming dormancy of basswood seeds. Collections should be made when seed coats turn brown but before they become dry and hard, or more specifically, when the moisture content is 20 to 40 percent of the green weight"
1,badly executed,"This is such a good idea, and such a shame that it is so badly executed. I read the reviews and thought that as is often the case it must be user error, or people not reading the manual. Unfortunately that's not the case - this product is just bad. The software is flakey at best. The keyboard worked for all of three days and then no amount of reinstalling drivers, upgrading versions, reinstalling Quicktime could get it working again. The lessons were deeply dull. Do not expect to sit a youngster down and have them learn on their own. Hopefully someone will pick up the idea and do a better job."
3,Software Good! Keyboard Not Necessary,The software program is ok. Although I found it more difficult than their Emedia Guitar CD-Rom. Unfortunately the people who teach these lessons are highly qualified dull people (sorry if you are that person). I was debating on purchasing the keyboard separately or together. The keyboard that comes with it connects to the computer. I thought that this would help me learn faster but I think it is really not necessary to get a keyboard that connects to the computer. Any keyboard will do fine in aiding the learning process. I am going to buy Scott the Piano Guys DVD as well. I prefer the his hands on demonstrations.
4,Works Fine,"Works great as a learning tool, however, if I ever become a Mozart I'll be sure to get something better!"
2,Incomplete keyboard system,"Well, the keyboard looks OK, there ae MIDI cables to go from keyboard to USB adapter, but NO USB cable, so the advertisement is INCORRECT making this keyboard system INCOMPLETE."
3,"Software is good, Keyboard is weak","Tried it out before giving as a gift, software was good but was not impressed with the keyboard. Could have purchased a reasonable MIDI keyboard and software for less than I paid for the eMedia keyboard and then have the option to play away from the computer."
2,anchor man,"good ideas and concepts for a christian father, but the writting is not very good, sometimes distracts from the concept with wrong examples."
3,Basix Litter Bag review,"My home is clean and my car is a mess, that's just how it's always been. I love this litter bag because I can keep my car clean and just toss the contents in the trash when I gas up my car. The velcro is nice to have because you can anchor is just about anywhere but unfortunately the sticky side that adheres to the vehicle lost its stick and I can't hang it anymore, which is a bit disappointing. This happened after just a week, but I would still buy this product again."
2,Basix litter bag,"This bag does not work well in my car - an Acura. The sticky tape refused to adhere, and there is no good place to hang the bag, so it is no longer in my car. It had a very short life there because it wasn't functional. It closed nicely, but was all over the floor."
3,don't go by color in picture,"Okay product, I'm bummed because I got a new car and wanted this to blend, not be a focal point. Apparently you don't get a color choice. They sent me black,not the color depicted."
4,Basix Litter bag,needed litter bag to fit inside automobile/truck door area it was a little to large but made do with it
4,Read this!,"A brilliant, sensitive, amusing, personal and deeply profound look at the current attitude towards important environmental issues including climate change - it depresses, accuses, relieves, encourages and instills hope in any environmentally aware soul and should provoke a serious response in any 'business as usual' die hard. A brilliant read."
1,Dissapointment,"This film was onlt 12 minutes long and showed nothing other than bad black and white picture.For a couple of dollars more the film Hiroshima is avaible and is the best film i have on Atomic weapons, and i have many."
2,Corpus Earthling = 2 stars out of 5,"Not much going on in this episode, it's been 4 days since I watched it and I almost forgot it. The story of 2 rocks conspiring to enter hosts so that they can begin an ""alien invasion?"" is just dumb. The whole episode deals with Robert Culp running from the nasty rocks!?! The plot holes, among other annoying things make this episode one to miss. The only saving grace of the 50 minutes was the atmosphere.thank you for your time, David"
5,At last! A book on silk shading that has clear instruction!,"I have done embroidery most of my life. As many others, I started with stamped embroidery and then moved to counted cross stitch. But I've thrown myself into hardanger, blackwork, goldwork and other techniques and now I'd like to try my hand at silk shading. There are many better picture books out there that help with silk shading, which I consider a variant of crewel, but Ms. Zimmerman says the right words at the right time to lead you through the stitching. No color photos. But there are drawings of frames and close-up steps of stitches which really reveal the how-to's. To supplement (or, yes, replace) this book, see:Silk Shading (Essential Stitch Guide)Needle Painting Embroidery: Fresh Ideas for Beginners (Milner Craft Series)Shay Pendray's Inventive NeedleworkBeginner's Guide to Crewel Embroidery"
4,adorable,"The piano is beautiful. It's a nice deep red color and the keys are a good size. Plus, it sounds good too!"
1,Poor quality,"We got this for our 14 month old, but the piano arrived with a couple dead keys. Their website says this may happen and to gently shake the piano upside down to fix. We did that. The keys unstuck... until they were pushed down again. It's a shame, really, because it was such a cute little piano, and our son never got to play it even once. I feel that the company is a little misleading. The products are made in China, but with the website emphasis on German engineering and mentioning a Florida factory, we thought we were getting a U.S. manufactured product made of German parts. Clearly, the company has little control over the quality of their end products. We paid the $15 return shipping, 10% restocking fee (OUCH!) and promptly returned this piano. We got our son a glockenspiel, instead.Sonor Children's Glockenspiel Soprano Chromatic"
2,"adorable, but horribly off-key","I asked for this for my daughter's first birthday, and it is gorgeous. Unfortunately, it's really off-key and painful to listen to - think horror movie sounds if you try playing a nursery rhyme on it. My daughter doesn't mind banging on it, but she likes the big piano in the living room better, and given how this one sounds, I'll let her play with the big one instead. I'd hate for her to think that's how the notes are supposed to sound."
2,broke,"It arrived broken, we returned it. Didn't ask for a replacement. It may have been a one-time thing...I read tons of positive reviews (which is why I bought it), so perhaps it was just a fluke.Basically the keys on one side were completely loose so they didn't make any noise at all, and the keys at the other end were 'stuck' in the up position so you couldn't press them down. Keys in the middle worked fine and made a good sound. My bf is a musician and wanted an authentic toy piano sound, he was really disappointed but we didn't want it bad enough to try a 2nd time."
1,What a disappointment!,"We got it for our 20-month old daughter for Christmas this year. It looks beautiful and I love the color. The sound, however, is absolutely dreadful, nothing resembling piano. One key is not working at all. You can tell it's not made very well, although we do love the red finish. Our daughter is little, and she loves banging on the keys, so it looks like we won't be returning it, but to those of you who are contemplating buying this item - save yourself the utter disappointment."
1,great piano - screwed up online store,"The piano is awesome. But these guys tell you it is shipping, give you a delivery date and the day before it is supposed to be here - when your daughter is all psyched about her new piano - they send you an email saying ""we are out of stock"". Um. Didn't you say it already shipped? Jerks.Cancelled the order and got the piano from someone else."
4,Cute piano - kids like it,"This piano is really, really cute - we got the red one for our 2 1/2 year old for Christmas and he loves to sit down and play with it - sometimes he'll bang, but other times he patiently plays one key at a time, just enjoying the different sounds. Seems like a very well made, very sturdy product and looks great, besides. My only problem? One key seems to be a bit out of tune! Not sure if we caused this or if it actually arrived that way since I didn't play it right away, granted, it's a kid's toy and not a recital piano, but still - it's a little diappointing to play a tune and have it not sound exactly right! Kid doesn't seem to mind, though - and it's not THAT far off! All in all, though - really nice toy - worth the money."
4,Not too bad,"There really aren't any options when it comes to new toy pianos; I'm pretty sure that the Schoenhut piano and the Melissa and Doug piano are the same thing, with different paint jobs. But for what it is, this piano is pretty good. There's no way that it could sound like a real piano, because real pianos use very large strings; strings short enough to fit in a toy piano would make incredibly high tones that only a dog could hear. Most of the mechanical issues that other customers have complained about--stuck keys, key not striking the tone bar--can be fixed by opening up the top and doing some minor noodling around, as the company suggests you might have to do. Overall it's a well-put-together toy that can teach kids how real musical instruments work."
1,Poor condition,"The box was dirty and completely damaged. I did not had the time to send it back and the days passed, but I was surprised to receive a merchandise in such bad condition."
1,It is a fake.,My wife is using Laura for years. We always bought it in Europe. We can not find it here in any store. So we ordered it. What a mistake. Even the plastic wrap around the Box is not original and so poorly made.The perfume it self has hardly any smell only alcohol with something!?!!!??DONT BY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,German House meets oompah music,"I thought German House music would be very progressive, however this compilation sounds very campy and corny. Many tracks have accordion music blended in, making them sound more like German folk music. Not what I expected."
3,wasn't what I expected,"Half of the space in this book is devoted to unnecessarily large drawings (illustrations). The text is VERY simplistic, e.g., it's a good idea to be extra nice to your partner during this period and help out. BOTTOM LINE: This might be a very valuable book for many people, especially as either an introduction or a summary. For more details on babies, check out THE NEW FATHER (Brott)."
3,Very Basic,"Bought this book for my fiance. Our first baby is due in September, and he is completely clueless about baby care and being a father. This book has very brief simplistic information on a lot of topics, but does not give in depth info on any aspect of baby care. This is a good starting point but I think we will have to find another book that will give him/us some more complete and helpful information."
5,great band,"Bella Morte has a beautiful sound, no matter the type various types of music and beats they play with. I have not hear one of their CD's I did not love to death."
4,Impressive Album,"Man, my review of this album was awful...my apologies to all who read it :-)Honestly, this release is just fabulous...it's constantly being shuffled onto my cd player and consistently sounds new and exciting.Highly recommended..."
5,breathtaking!,"what can I say but that this group is something that seems to be chosen to descend on us from another planet with this beautifully crafted work of art!I truly have a cd collection that ranges from anything and everything...including some of the best known and least known ""goth"" and ""darkwave"" records and by far this one will always remain number one!cant say much more but say to buy this cd and you will not be sorry!"
4,Luxurious!,"Olay's complete body wash for extra dry skin is a soap-free formulation with Shea Butter and vitamins E, A and B3 which are supposed to penetrate the skin and condition the skin for 24 hours. It also is advertised as rinsing clean.This is a very pleasant body wash that turns into a gentle, nourishing creamy lather on the skin. The scent is hard to describe, it is very mild and does not stay on the skin. Perhaps a very light honey and floral scent? The lather rinses clean as advertised. Afterward the skin feels fresh and moisturized--but I still need moisturizer afterwards.Complete Body Wash is a high quality, mild shower gel which I recommend for dry skin. Watch out when you squeeze the bottle--the body wash comes out very fast and only a little of this rich gel is needed."
5,simply the BEST....,"this wash, simple, smooth, foaming and luxurious is simply the BEST. i have been using it for years and, when there are no sales on it and costco has switched to another 'shiny object', i turn to amazon! i get it 6 or so at a time...and keep it in every bath tub/shower in the house! guests love it and pay it forward!"
1,Forming the plural of substantives in English,"This review is for the title of the disc in question. Listen to what I'm about to say. To form the plural of a substantive -- i.e. a noun -- in English, in most cases you need only add an 's' or sometimes an 'es'. Two or more people playing the piano would be two or more pianists, not pianist's. To speak of ""Four Great Pianist's"" is to talk nonesense. Are the wheels coming off the wagon at amazon?"
2,Too much static and alarm,"This monitor didn't work for us at all! We heard a lot of static, and the alarm would go off too. It wouldn't work anywhere in my livingroom or kitchen. The alarm was always going off."
2,Degrading Over Time,"I'm trying to recall if this monitor was better when it was new (2 years ago). My wife thinks it was, but I'm not so sure. Nonetheless, I'm now shopping for a new monitor as our second child is arriving soon and this monitor has WAY too much noise and static rather than clean, clear signal at the parent/receiver end. The volume has to be set very low or we can't sleep with the loud hiss, and we're just in the next room down the hall; it's basically unusable at this point. I won't buy it again, and instead will spend a little more on something with better sound/range."
2,Great at First.. Hate It Now,"When I first got this monitor, it worked great. I could hear my baby breathe through it which was comforting. After about a year, it suddenly doesn't hold a charge and gives this horribly loud static noise at the slightest sound in the baby's room (even the sound of a car passing by the street). So now it has to be hooked to electricity to avoid that problem.Plus, the baby's room is on the other side of the house from mine. If my husband is walking anywhere in the house, I hear static and sometimes the alarm even goes off.Bottom line, I hate this monitor. And I'm shopping for something else."
1,Terrible quality,"We have the 49MHz Whisper Connect and love it (see our review of that one). We needed a second monitor to replace a 900MHz Fisher Price monitor that is 4+ years old, and decided to try this one out. We set the base across the room from our daughter and had her talk at her normal voice, and we could barely hear here with the volume turned up. We thought we must have a defective unit, so we returned it and got another, and we had the same problem. There is no interference or static with the monitor - but also no sound. We're very unhappy with it and would not recommend it."
4,It works and great for the money,"It's not the clearest or the easiest to use, but it does work. You can tell the difference between the baby and other sounds. It's pretty sensitive and we've been happy with it. I don't think you can go wrong for the money. If I were grading it by value for the money, I'd give it a higher rating. But I'm rating it based on what it does over others I've seen or heard about."
2,still looking for the right one,"I thought I'd try this monitor since it was a 900Mhz and had a far range. Well, I have problems similar to Sara's. When I used the alternate channel to avoid the intermittant loss of signal and beeps, I would get horrible static when my cordless phones rang or were being used. When there was no beeping or loss of signal it's reception was clear. That's why I gave it a 2nd star. This product is going back to the store tomorrow and I will continue my quest to search for the right monitor."
4,"Yummy, but too much sugar","This soup is delicious, but it has 7 grams of sugar in a 1-cup serving. I wish he'd cut back on it."
5,Best Can Soup EVER!,"This is the best can organic vegetable soup ever! I have tried lots of veggie soups out there and nothing compares to this soup, but you have to pay the price for this soup. As much as I love it, I am not always willing to pay the price for a can of soup. If it gets any more expensive, I will have to ask that a cook come to my house and heat it up for me, at that price! Great soup, but you pay for it! Wait until it goes on sale and then try it (not to often)."
5,"Fast, sturdy and small","I have been using this product for about a month (so far). It's metallic construction makes it heavier than other similar products in its category, but it also gives you the feeling of sturdiness and durability, specially if you move it a lot.The installation is super simple and in my case I had no problem with defective parts (provided power supply and the switch itself).This unit operates 24/7 in my home handling 2 media hubs and a desktop into the broadband Internet router.When the price comes down again I am likely to purchase another one."
4,Netgear 5 port router,"I love these, we can use them in remote towers (we run a WISP) and they just run and run unlike their cheaper brothers. The docs are kind of limited and such features as Spanning Tree Protocol either isn't available or they forgot to mention it in their very limited documentation, online as well. Don't let that defer you, this is a hot little item and the price is right, as they say on TV."
2,Not Gigabit Compatible,"Connected to Linksys E3000 router. NO GIGABIT connection. wth. works at 100mbps. but it's for the living room, and maxes out. idea was to have a gigabit link to the computer room. NOT worth the extra $ from a Fast Ethernet switch."
3,Works Well Most Of The Time,"This product does just what we wanted - allows us to expand our network to more than just the 4 devices that most routers accept.The only problem we've had is that our computers run fine for about a day, after which the internet connection seems to stop working. Rebooting the cable modem, router and switch solves this but it's a hassle we didn't have to deal with until we installed this switch.FYI: we are using a Netgear router and Linksys/Cisco cable modem."
4,Great for quick and easy expansion,"We buy these when we add peripherals and don't want the electrician to have to come out and wire more ports. They're small and mount easily to the wall. With no configuration necessary, it's easy to turn one port into 4 more without a whole lot of hassle. Being gigabit, we don't worry about compromising speed or expandability in the future.The loss of a star is since we had a FS16 break and NetGear basically told us to screw off as it was out of warranty."
4,Works perfectly!,I've located the switch in my attic and I've dropped 3 Cat5e cables to my upstairs rooms - and connectivity from all is perfect@
1,AVOID THIS PRODUCT,"not plug and play. not user friendly. not worth buying. imagine he worst purchase you've made, scale it back accordingly, and you have a 40 dollar 'worst purchase ever...' this thing just plain sucks. i bought it solely on my experiences in the past with netgear, and, I'll not buy net gear again. ever."
5,Easy as Pie,"I have a TV, Receiver and PS3 which is 40+ feet away from my wireless/dsl router. I didn't want to buy 120 feet worth of ethernet cables. Plus I would probably need it just for the ps3, but in the instance where I need my tv or receiver to update firmware through the internet, i didn't want to crawl behind my entertainment center to switch cables from the PS3 to any other hardware.With the color coded ethernet cables [...] I was able to plug them in and 'Voila!' automatic connection!Its:-Simple-No required ISP/Gateway numbers to register-Small/ Compact"
4,REBATE IS MIS-LEADING - $10 off NEXT Purchase of Netgear,Rebate is $10 off your NEXT purchase of Netgear equipment. This is NOT stated anywhere except the terms of rebate link. The posting is misleading. Item is excellent BTW. Use Netgear is you want the best and no problems.
2,port failure,"I really like this device when I first got it because it was a plug and go device. However, 8 months later, one of the ports has failed. None of the devices I plug into this port work on that port, but they work on the other ports. The warranty is only 90 days and I will now need to get another device."
3,not the best,Unfortunately this switch over heated on me three time forcing to replace it with my old switch. Not my best buy on amazon.
5,Fast and reliable Gbit switch,"the GS105 is what it claims to be a good fast switch It easy to install, and I had no issues at all. I ran out of ports on my router with gigabit ports, so I need to get something that would let me be able to still share files from my PC's at Gbit speeds. GS105 is the answer and the price can't be beat. Plus Amazon...enough said."
5,Excellent,"Snagless and pacey... not pretty but these things rarely are.Very Compact heavy and well built, worked without any issues."
3,Netgear GS105,"NETGEAR GS105 ProSafe 5-Port Gigabit Ethernet Desktop SwitchI have purchased several of these switches. The reason being that every time we have a close thunderstorm, they die. One good thing is that they work fine on a 12V battery. I am networked over 650 feet, with the switch in the middle, run by a trolling motor battery. If any other company makes a gigabit switch, I'll switch brands trying for longer life."
5,Works great - simple setup,"So pleased with this switch that I bought a second one! Very simple set up, just plugged it in, done. Worked immediately with both my Linksys router system and continued to work without a hitch when I switched routers to a D-Link."
4,"good switch, but really that necessary?","My place is pretty small and I just needed a switch to get my computer and laptop doing at the same time. This one works and works fine, but just feel like it is too much for a switch. I guess if you are a pro and get real fast internet, this might be good, but didn't notice a difference for me..."
3,"Functional, but...","I bought this to use on my workbench, and it's done it's job. The power connection seems like the weak point of an otherwise sturdy design. Mine comes unplugged/loose every so often from being moved around. Wouldn't be an issue if it was screwed to a wall in a closet. I do like the port lights right on the ports, as it's easy to interpret."
3,first one showed up dead,No real magic to this product. Does what its supposed to it ... be an unmanaged switch.I held back a couple of stars because the first one showed up dead i.e. had the well documented Netgear blinking lights of death syndrome. Excellent service by Amazon and the replacement has been working well for a few months now.
2,Three units dead after a 3 to 5 years,"I bought two of these switches five years ago when the price came down to $60 on sale. The first one started acting bad after three years. The second one started acting bad after five. Both have intermittent problems at 1000BaseT speeds (100BaseT is fine). My buddy bought one on the same day as me. His completely died after five years. Except for my very first Netgear router, this brand has not failed to disappoint. I'm sticking with the cheap Airlink stuff."
5,NetGear switch,Got the product I ordered. Came with all accessories in good condition. Works great. Would recommend this seller to others.
2,Huge tablets!,"The company is quite good. But, the size of these tablets are just ENORMOUS! I mean real horse pills. i tried cutting them in half to take them and choked as they are so chalky! So, good product, just difficult for most people to actually swallow and I take a lot of vitamins a day. These I'm afraid I can't manage."
5,Primary Target,"I've not only reviewed this book, I have very critically written it. This is one of the only Coast Guard action packed novels out there. Take a look at it, you won't be disappointed."
1,Worthless,"Cheaply made, hard to program, and only works at certain angles when pointed at the TV. Manual sucks, reads like it was written in chinese, translated into japanese, and then translated into English by a Spanish immigrant from El Salvador. Enough Said."
3,some additional thoughts,"my new 17 oz mug is pretty much what everyone here has been saying, but i'm not as excited about it as i had hoped because of two things:-the handle is too thin and awkward to hold. it doesn't give that solid ""mug"" feel i've been looking for.-unfinished casting seams are rough and annoying, particularly the one around the outside rim (where the two halves of the mold were apparently bonded together) and there's also one running down the middle of both sides of the handle. i guess i can sand those down but should i have to do that?although overall its a tough, pretty, lightweight, taste-free, functional, insulated mug, it isn't as perfect as i had dreamed (but what in life is?)."
3,Tervis Mug,"I thought I would love these mugs but for the price, I was disappointed. First, the edge around the top is not that smooth and comfortable for drinking. Second, the labels were difficult to remove that came on the cup and I wound up causing clouding trying to remove the stickiness. That wound up not to matter that much because shortly after minimal use the mugs became extremely cloudy and unattractive any. Probably would be better off with a solid color vs. clear. They work OK though, coffee does stay warmer than a typical ceramic or china mug/cup."
4,tervis tumbler review,it is AWESOME2nd one puchased-lifetime guaranteeI've had my 1st one since February and this new one (a gift to my Dad)since June...so far so good...
4,Good not great,Works well for keeping stuff at temperature. plastic and doesn't look all that good but not horrid (looks a lot better in the picture than in person). Overall does a very good job of temperature control; but I am not sure it will hold up in the dishwasher and it appears to be less durable than I would like for the price.
5,Mighty Day on Campus,"If any of you saw my other reviews you see my musical taste are all over the place. While listening to the sounds of the 50's and 60's Folk music snuck in and was very popular. While I would assume Peter, Paul and Mary were the most popular, the Chad Mitchell Trio was right up there with many songs and albums. This one happens to be my favorite. Its funny, its serious and its lively with great harmony and voices. I would recommend this album to all."
5,A True Folk Music Gem,"I have owned this album since it was first released around 1961, and it remains one of my favorites. The Trio is in superb form, with great harmonies and Chad's extraordinary soaring tenor rising above the solid accompaniment by Jim McGuinn (who later changed his first name to Roger and founded the Byrds). The fact that this was recorded live only testifies to the Trio's talent, as their sound could not be improved if it were a studio recording. This is a must for any fan of folk music, and will be a special treat for those who are unaware of the Trio."
4,Epitome of College Folk Singers,"Mighty Day on Campus is the epitome of the '60's folk singing phenomenon, bright, bouncy, irreverant and it is obvious both artists and audience are enjoying themselves. The Johnny compilation is well done while Swing on the Bell Nellie always makes me smile, even after listening to it for longer than I care to admit, both on vinyl and CD"
5,Mighty Day on Campus,"I love the Chad Mitchell Trio, and purchased this album in the 70's. When I saw it on CD, I immediately re-purchased it so I can enjoy it today, too. Back to the 'good ol' hootenanny days!!"
2,Cute but flimsy...,"The color is a nice, deep red, but the padding is minimal. When getting a hot pan out of the oven I can only hold on to it for a count of two at the most before it starts to burn my hand. I'll probably have to buy a nicer brand-name product for my kitchen needs and then use these as a backup. Great, though, if you are just using them to tie some colors together in a kitchen."
2,over priced,if a company is going to make a profit thats fine but dont leave the original retail tags on it. it was only $2 more on each mitt than retail but i paid a ridiculous amount of shipping for this item
3,"great book, but should have been better proof read","I was very impressed with this book. That is, until I checked out the entry on the United States. I couldn't believe my eyes - Alaska and Hawaii were not included in the map. Poor proof reading, at best."
1,Big disappointment,"I bought this book and find it absolutely useless. If you expect to learn something about a country this is not the book for you. It is a big waste of money. A huge heavy book that will gather dust on your coffee table. Very little information about the countries. I found it absolutely uselss and rather typical of the out-of-date information that Lonely Planet turns out today. If you are a traveler and want to learn something about the countries of the world, find another book. Very sorry that I bought it."
3,"Fine, until you hit a country you know","Look, this is a gorgeous book, but careless. So I get to Slovenia and find that a local drink is called ganje and a local food is called likrofi (or was it ganci). I don't remember about the latter because the mistakes I found were why I didn't buy the book but only browsed in it in a bookstore. In other words, somebody dropped the z with the little rooflet on top, which is a Slovenian letter, but which Lonely Planet was not up to. The drink is zganje, not ganje, but there is an accent on the z which I am not technically up to, but LP should be. And the food is zlikrofi, same accent on the z, not likrofi(or zganci,not ganci, if I misremember). This is an old problem with LP. You should see the howlers in the Italian Food book. What, for instance, dear Lonely Planet, is Italian for mushrooms? LP gets away with all this carelessness because nobody dares correct venerable LP and so they rest on their laurels. Believe me, there are worse problems with LP."
3,First reference prior to travel,"Interesting aaproach to travel info. Weather and best time to travel, for instance"
1,Was not Delivered,Fed Ex stated that the book was delivered on 2 Dec at 13:51 local time. There was two people at the residence duringthis time and we are absolutely sure that it was not delivered. Nothing else to say...James Phillips
5,Travel the world from your living room,"Contains wonderful pictures, facts and maps of every country on earth. I never get bored flipping through it. People are always amazed and look through it when they come over to my house, it is always sitting on the coffee table. Well worth the price, perfect for planning your next holiday or if you're just a dreamer like me, this book can take you anywhere. Another great release from the guys at lonely planet."
3,Great Pictures!,"This is a book that has fantastic pictures of all the countries in the world, but it lacks information about each country. I travel a lot so I like to keep travel books of all the countries I been to not only containing pictures, but also information. I thought ""The Travel Book"" would have more details of places to go and visit, but it didn't. If you are a demanding traveler I would only recommend this book as one to have with nice pictures, that's all. Thank you.Malala, Argentina."
2,Too Little About Too Much,"I borrowed this book from the local library and found it to be one of the most unwieldly books in existence! It weighs a freakin' ton and needs to be put on a table (instead of your lap) to look at. Totally impractical. Additionally, the photos for the most part aren't all that great. Information is minimal. What irritates me most is each country's skeletal map which doesn't show it's relationship to the rest of the world. Oh sure, you can go back to map of the world at the front of the book and read thru all the tiny names to find the country you are looking at, but you'll probably fracture your arm in the process. Individual maps could at least have shown the country within it's continent or region. A much better book for travelers is National Geographic's Journeys of a Lifetime 500 of the World's Greatest Trips. It may not include every country in the world, but it's much more informative, original and the photos are gorgeous!"
3,"Open the door and take a step outside. Try it, you might like it","I just received my book and as many reviews state, yes it has wonderful pictures.Update, I just returned from reaching my 22nd country and after having explored Central America, I changed my mind about this book. While the book lacks in detail, it is rich on ideas and places to visit. It's also a great way to say to your friends, I was here and here and then I went there too. Maybe it will encourage them to put on their walking shoes and go out to explore our world."
2,Misleading title,"Beautiful photographs and some creative suggestions, but certainly not a ""journey"" through each country. The entries consist of about 5 pictures, best time to visit, very short media and eating recommendations, and a (sometimes stereotypical) paragraph about each country. Its more of a picture book than a travel book."
2,A Disappointment!,"I was really surprised with the poor writing quality of this book, especially with the ""Trademarks"" feature. Two of the USA's trademarks were oversized people and oversized portions. What?? Talk about terrible writing and useless information. Some of the photos were good but overall this is not a good travel book. I would highly recommend a DK travel guide or the Random House World Atlas and Encyclopedia"
3,Good overview of the world,"This is a fine coffee table book that will give you a brief look at every country in the world. The pictures are quite remarkable.I was disappointed at the description trademarks of the United States--dangerous cities,loud people, gun lovers and the movies to watch ""The Godfather"" and ""American Beauty"". No mention of the striking wilderness and raw beauty of Alaska or the fabulous beaches of Hawaii. Obviously the author(an Aussie) failed to catch the essence of America--makes me slightly suspect of the bias in descriptions of other countries as well.All in all, an eye catching book that will make you lust for the road!"
4,Great dream starter,"This is a beautiful coffee-table sized book that gives the reader a ""taste"" of every country in the world. As a traveler, I love the pictures and the opportunity to learn about countries I read and hear about. It'a a great introduction and the references to movies, books and movies about the country are helpful too."
5,Informative,Beautiful images with informative and usefull information. Makes you want to travel more! Good value for money. Great coffee table book and gift.
1,Ugh,It appears that extra effort was made to capture the ugliest sights to photograph in each country.
4,Wonderful reference,"This book, in fact, is a very like a kind of reference book of geography rather than a travel book but you can use it to give you a rough idea of the countries you want to visit before you are really going to plan your trip.Anyway, after reading this book, you will know how large is the world and make you always dream of the next destination for the travellers."
5,Great coffee table book!,"This book is fantastic for the travel lover. Beautiful, colorful pictures highlight each of the countries. I saw countries I thought I knew well in a whole new light!"
4,"good, but nothing special","This book is huge, letter format and has a good quality. Every country in the world is introduced on a double page - this often leaves only the most obvious tourist sites for display, albeit with nice pictures.If you look for some inspiration where to go to and which country to explore, this book is well suited for you. If you are looking for more details, you will be disappointed. However, you can always get yourself excited for a particular country and then read more literature about it.You won't regret the money spent, but you may not be amazed by the book."
2,Dissapointed!,"Nearly no information and rather uninteresting photographs! Before buying the book I knew that it's a bit low in text but considering the size of it they could have fitted some more information. I thought that this book would have nice photos of landscapes and cities to get an idea what the country looks like but instead it has huge close-up pictures of people's faces, feet and other weird things. However, the few landscape/nature pictures it has are actually very good. There were also some spelling mistakes concerning local words. Are they just guessing how foreign words are spelled or what??"
5,just what i expected!,"the book came to me in the condition i expected and more! i had gotten a little message from the seller that said, ""thanks for your purchase, and i hope you enjoy this book as much as i did!"" i was very touched and i love the book so much!"
1,not what you think,The descroption of this product is very misleading. In no way does it ever tell you that these feet are made of plastic. Not sure I would trust them to hold a TV or any thing else that might be heavy.
1,Alternate feet,I like the look of the system and am excited to put the whole thing together. I read the reviews and have taken not of the feet being plastic. So I have taken the trouble to get wooden bun furniture feet and the plates to mount them. They are on the bottom of the combi-cube. The squat bun feet look cool with the dark alder cube. They are worth the effort to get a good base for the whole system and to feel like they will support several cubes built up vertical. So back to the assembling!
4,perfect mix and match,"My husband and I have been looking for a stylish way to house our cds and dvds as well as finding an entertainment system to house a 36 inch television. These really dont exist. With the Q-bits modular system, we can keep the center part that houses the television, vcr, dvd player and disc changer and add the the modular systems to the side achieving an entertain ment center look that fits everything perfect. I love the color because it also will go with many other home furnishings."
3,"These legs hold up, but be aware.....","These legs do the job, but be aware that they are molded PLASTIC, made to look like brushed nickel. I was a bit disappointed when I opened the box at home and found that they weren't actually metal, which I was lead to believe, from the description as ""brushed Nickel-finish""."
3,My memory surpasses the reality...,"Sharon Webb's trilogy was something I experienced years ago as a YA. I loved the idea of living forever and the way the futuristic society was portrayed. However, a recent reunion with these books has brought out some of the flaws in her writing. While the characters are still as real to me as they were, the plot suffers from lack of action and from a couple of spots where she loses my suspension of disbelief. I would recommend these books to YA's who are just getting into science fiction reading but not to anyone with more sophisticated tastes."
5,Great!,it is really good! the texture isnt exactly jelly but it is closeit came a day before it was soposto and it is just great!
1,Don't waste your money on this book,This book is the most ridiculous book I have ever bought or read. I can't even believe I wasted my money on this book. It is written for a 3rd grader and states obvious facts. It was a waste of money and time.
1,???????????,"If you are already familiar with Nature-based spirituality, this book isn't going to tell you anything you don't already know. Mr. Hardin fills up the pages of his book with flowery words, elaborates on every minute detail, and gives no practical down-to-earth advice for living close to the Earth.I think this book was written for entertainment purposes only. If you expect to learn anything from it, forget it."
3,Drum & Bass for Friends and Cocktails,"With hardstep so dominant in the d&b world right now, it is refreshing to hear breakbeats and bass with some sense of subtlety. The most rockin' track on this album (and the initial reason I bought it) is the collision of d&b and dancehall on track 5. However, that track is actually atypical of the rest of the material; instead it ranges from gentle d&b to down-tempo, with some dub-ish elements and pop-ish vocals also entering the mix. The result isn't entirely fresh but by-and-large satisfying. If you need a break from d&b a la Dieselboy (respect going out all the same!), and need an alternative to LTJ Bukem, give this a try."
3,Quiet coolness,"I say ""quiet music"" because it seems like even the more energetic songs on this album are subdued. But this album will grow on you before you know it. This music, if hard to define, is definitely original. Definitely a nice fit in the eighteenth street lounge label. I call it dub'n'bass. Check it out, you will dig."
3,"fairly run of the mill, yet still worth a shot...","well, I must say, I expected much more from a dj coming of the ESL label, since I love Thievery Corporation so much, but THunderball is NO thievery Corporation...there are a few fun tracks, but all in all the cd is fairly neutral and run of the mill...there really isn't much that distinguishes it from many other Drum and bass cds...but some may like it. Not all bad, but certainly nothing to fawn over..."
3,Not like her others,"I couldn't wait to get my hands around this newest Elizabeth Berg title, but I found it to be somewhat of a disappointment compared to the incredible strength and power of her previous work. Since the main characters are young sisters the comparison to Joy School and Durable Goods is inevitable. But What We Keep, at least for me, seemed to lack the sheer magic and subtle beauty of those two titles. The characters were not fully realized, the mother's motivation weak and ill-defined at best, and the prose itself did not have moments where my breath was captured and spirited away like her other works seemed to do on every page. I am not, however, a fair weather fan, and am still waiting for the next one after this."
2,What We Lose,"I may be wrong, but I suspect Ms. Berg was not abandoned by either of her parents. This story is a perfect example of what happens when you try to write about what you don't know. Lack of insight, credibility, and originality."
4,Explores the Complexity of Mother-Daughter Relationships,I thought that this book really hit on the issues affecting women in their relationships with each other. Whilst you sympathise with Ginny and Sharla you also feel that they are being unfair to their mother. It must have been a very hard choice for her to make. In is not until Ginny is an adult that she is able to see this. I was profoundly touched.
4,Different interpretation,"I think the author is sympathetic to both the children and the mother. However, some reviewers are more sympathetic to the mother than the children. The author shows that children do NOT want to be friends with their mothers (as one of the daughters says). Children need a parent who takes care of them and is there for them, and NOT remote and unattainable. Mature parents have to meet their children's needs first and thir own needs second. Marion had other choices-she could have grown and pursued her artistic interests while the children were in school and stopped being a false self without leaving the children. The author understands the children' suffering and does not expect children to nuture their parents."
3,Sending a copy to my mom!,"I was so disappointed to read the ""professional"" reviews above that really slammed this book. I read it this afternoon and no, it doesn't break any new ground and no, there's no profound life lesson to learn, but I found it a captivating read. It brought memories of my mom, my childhood and how the world revolved around me flooding back to me. Consider it a delightful summer read with no heavy lifting!"
1,A Different Take,"I usually enjoy reading EB's books as I find them insightful, humorous and easy to read in a leisurely fashion. I've read quite a few of the reviews of this book and have a completely different take. If I'd managed to raise two selfish, self-centered monsters who insisted their mother wait on them hand and foot, I'd be like Marion and lament going astray in parenting skills. How anyone could have compassion for these little manipulative twits is beyond me and only wonder why Marion didn't bail sooner. Not only are Ginny and Sharla obnoxious pieces of work, dear old dad is a major loser. Stiff, cold, inflexible, that's dad. I'd rather hang out with Marion than any of these other characters. I'll continue to read EB's books and hope they're more believable than this offering."
5,She did it again,"In What We Keep, Elizabeth Berg has once again perfectly captured what it is like to be a girl going through something hard. This time, the story is about sisters and mothers, too, and Berg has captured those relationships with delicate humor and insight that no other author does quite so well. It is poignant, funny, heartbreaking and happy all at once. My only complaint is that it was too short."
1,Who wants to read about a mother abandoning her daugthers?,"And feel bad in the process? Not me! As a previous poster mentioned there is no real lesson to be learned here. Bad choices are made, and you get to feel melancholic throughout. I'll be glad when this book is out of my house.For a happy read with the right values, I'd recommend The Number one Lady Detective Agency, by Alexander Mcall Smith. Enjoy!"
5,One of Berg's Best (and that's saying a lot!),"I am also surprised to see any negative reviews on this book. I have read all of Berg's books and this is one of my favorites. I love the sister relationship, and found the book a very realistic and touching portrayal of the way women, sisters, mothers/daughters relate. I read it when it was first published and the characters and insights are still fresh in my mind."
3,Not bad...,"Not bad, I prefer longer books though to really get into the characters etc. Didn't really get the character of the mother, who is so important to the book."
2,Unenlightened,"This book left much to be desired. The storyline wasn't great, and the main character was unsympathetic and unlikeable. The only reason I finished it in spite of this was that Berg has a beautiful way with words. I liked the way she put words together to create a particular feel or image, and look forward to seeing if she has anything better out there than this."
5,Very good,"This is a very good story. It moves you along, you aren't left bored at parts. She tells stories about women better than most..."
4,Casper's Review on a Heartwarming Tale,"This novel is an endearing relationship between a mother and her two daughters. Although the plot was semi-predictable, I enjoyed reading this book. The most enjoyable part of this book was the maternal bonds that exist despite their seperation. The story progresses well through Ginny's flashbacks on a plane ride to see her mother. Which in fact, she hasn't seen in 35 years, due to her detailed reasoning in this book. I highly recommmend this novel to anyone , from ages 16 and up, who are looking for a heartwarming tale."
4,What We Keep by E. Berg,This book was the August selection for our book group. It was liked by the majority. The narrative by the twelve year old character was realistic and touching. The relationships that developed were interesting and revealing. The end of the book did leave us thinking that the character may have been less than complete. We did find it easy to read.
4,BERG WRITES BEAUTIFULLY,"I am an avid fan of Berg, and in ""What We Keep"" she enhances my devotion to her expert writing.The tale explores motherhood, the bond of mothers and daughters, lost dreams, revengeful isolation, and reconcilation. Written with clarity of characters, impressive descriptions, heart-rendingly believable situations, this is a must read. The ending bares some unrealistic traits, thus the 4 stars instead of 5.Tori Amos's lyrics begin the book, and after the read they will haunt you. I can only wonder how much the lyrics birthed the book, but it is of no matter. The book delivers on nearly all counts. Well done, Ms. Berg, one of my new favorite author's."
3,Strictly Girl Stuff,"I didn't particularly like Berg's novel, but I thought the subject made compelling reading. It's like eavesdropping; we know we shouldn't listen, but we are fascinated by other people's problems. What Berg does well is to focus on a particular relationship, and show us that relationship through the eyes of an adolescent. In flipping through several of her novels I have noticed that she often uses a twelve or thirteen-year-old girl as the main protagonist, that most of her books are in the first person, and that they all deal with emotional crises of one sort or another: death, divorce, abuse, abandonment, forgiveness. These are the themes she illustrates through her stories. The writing is simplistic, but immediate; the reader gets a close look at what it's like to be a young adolescent girl."
4,This wasn't supposed to be literary hugs and kisses,"This is my first and only book read by Elizabeth Berg so far and I enjoyed this book a lot. The ending is a bit abrupt, but people like resolution, I guess. It's unfortunate that some people were expecting the same from EB, which I believe would be a huge sign that the author isn't creative and/or is in a rut. She could really take me back to her childhood and EB capturing the sisterly bond between Ginny and Sharla was a nice read. I read this novel in a women's lit class in college and approached it from a feminist standpoint. The dad wasn't the greatest by any means, but consider what time period this was written for. Martha, the woman seated next to her on the plane, notes to Ginny that ""people like 'differentness' in everything except their mothers."" If you approach the novel like that, you can empathize with both sides of the story and makes for a much more interesting read."
4,Another good vacation read,"Found this book from a used book cart for $1 while on vacation. It looked like a great vacation book and it didn't disappoint. I was really drawn into the story and could not put it down!The only major complaint I have is that the information revealed about the father at the end of the story was totally *not* believable based on his character as developed throughout the story. It was totally from left field and felt like it was thown into the story simply for effect.That aside, this was the first book by this author and I'm looking forward to reading some of her other works."
1,What We Keep,"Women friends raved about Elizabeth Berg and this is the first Elizabeth Berg book for me and the last. I thought writing style was very good, however, the story simplistic and shallow. I cannot believe that women readers find this risky or revealing dynamics between mothers and daughters of the 50s."
2,BOR-ING!!!,"Are you kidding me? I cannot believe what other readers are saying about this book. It was such a snoozer! I barely made it to the end, and only did out of boredom. It was predictable and slow. This is the only one of Berg's books I've read. But NO THANK YOU on any of the rest! ZZzzzzzz"
1,rating should be -20,"This is the worst book I have ever read. If you have the choice between reading this book or having a thousand ants eat away at your eyeballs, go with the ants."
4,A must have disc,Two absolutely fine musicians who warm my heart.Not many discs in my collection are played as oftenas this wonderful selection.
3,WWII Legal Thriller,Lt. Armando Grassi was shot. Why? He was disliked if not hated by all because of his abrasive personality. A blackmarket smuggling ring involving high ranking U.S. and British figures was operating almost carte blanche. Investigation of Lt. Grassi's murder leads to some seemingly unlikely participants. Justice is ultimately served to the guilty parties.
4,Too Big for DSLR and External Flash,"I just got the bag and was dying to love it, and it is a great bag. Just too small for a NikonD90 with 18-200mm lens and external flash. It all fits, but I think it will be too hard to pull it out and put it back on the fly. Also, I don't see my wife putting everything back the exact right way to make it all fit. Therefore, I think it is too close for comfort.I am returning this and ordering the 5m home. Hope it is not too big, but I would rather have a bag that is a too big than too small.Great quality and would definitely recommend it for a DSLR with no external flash. It would go in and out easily."
5,Crumpler is the best,You can never go wrong with Crumpler. The design looks more like a messenger bag than a camera bag. Nearly indestructible. My bag has seen a lot of wear and tear and it still looks great.
5,A good looking camera bag? Who would have thought?,"Excellent product. Bag is high quality, has good physical protection - from a company that cares about how people look. The only problem is that I have a Canon 5D w/24-105mm lens. I read reviews on other sites that said the 4M bag works for this, but IMO this bag is too small for that camera. I can't really close the flap correctly. Need to upgrade to a 5M bag. 4M is probably perfect for a Canon xsi or even a 50D/5D w/shorter lens. Crumpler - make one without velcro - it is really loud to open in quiet places. Otherwise, great product thanks!"
4,Good Seafood Book is Great!,"Like Wayne Scott, I don't at all agree with the other reviewer, who found Jane Brody's seafood book mechanical, or uninspired, or in any way disparaging the culinary pleasures of seafood. Brody is not writing for that seafood afficianado. Instead, she's touting the pleasures of seafood to the uninitiated--a role she also held before researching this book. She came to fish for health reasons, as so many of us have. And she gives us every reason to be glad we did! The recipes are delicious, well written, and simple. I'm thoroughly sold on it. And now I'm ready to try her other cookbooks."
3,Mixed feelings,"I have mixed feelings about this cookbook. I've owned it for years. I love seafood and am a fresh and saltwater fisherman who'll eat just about anything that comes out of the water.That said, there are very few recipes in this book that make me want to try them with my bounty from the lake and sea. I have several good cookbooks from my native Louisiana that I continually go to for great recipes to try.I can't put my finger on why this cookbook fails to inspire me. It has a great variety of recipes using a wide variety of seafood. It has good information, an easy-to-use layout, nice illustrations, etc. The reason this book is still on my shelf is for the USDA seafood glossary that gives a great overview of the nutritional and species information for a great variety of fish. I keep saying I'm going to cut that section out and get rid of the book, but I can't bear to mutilate any book!"
1,Not a good cow bell,"My cow does not like this cow bell. It's WAY TOO BIG. I don't know what kind of cow they were thinking of, but I've been around a lot of cattle, and I've never seen one that needs a bell that's this big.Also, I had to jury-rig a clapper (the part that rings the actual bell). This one came without one. I guess they want you to buy that separately (and probably pay separate shipping!)"
2,no inner piece! great size though.,I was so excited about this cowbell for my husband's triathlons but there is no inner piece to clang against the bell. You need a drum stick or something. So bummed because it is a great size. I wish the description stated you need an additional piece of equipment. Many if the other cowbells indicate additional equipment is needed. I returned it. Customer service was great & processed the return quickly.
1,This book is simplistic and poorly argued.,"&#65279;If you can read past the almost unbearably smug introduction, you will see that Ms. Shalit has written a myopic book based on half-baked research. Although she is well-read and brings a wide variety of authors and philosophers into her argument, too much of her research is simplistic and superficial (a few letters from women's magazines do not make a very solid argument). Her basic point may be worthwhile (after all who wants to see 13 year olds dressed like sluts?), but the execution nearly defeats its validity. It's too bad she didn't speak to more women who grew up before the sexual revolution, when date raped happened but simply wasn't reported and when girls who accidentally got pregnant had to quickly marry or face ostracism. I don't know about you, but I don't want to go back to the 1950s (let alone the 19th century) - my guess is that Shalit wouldn't want to either, if she knew what it was really like for women then."
3,Still hope in higher education.,"Right or wrong it is good to see a young person not in lockstep with Hollywood - Academia establishment. The ""we have finally arrived"" snobbery that took hold in the seventies has hindered development of the social sciences. Nice Job!"
1,Boooring,"Boring, boring, boring. If at least Wendy could make an interesting, never mind,persuasive, argument... Plus she's a poor writer."
1,This book is not G-rated,"I bought this book thinking it was something I could share with my teenage daughter to help reinforce the importance of modesty. What I found was ALOT of sexual content. And after a graphic and very disturbing description of the rape and murder of a young girl (was the author going for shock value) in chapter three I decided that the best place for this book is in the trash. Maybe it gets better later, but this is one reader who is not going to find out."
2,Interesting Read But Lacking,Found the book intersting but lacking in real discussion. Would like to have seen more argument/evidence for some sort of balance: should women be wearing bathing suits or burqas? The book did little to address these difficult cultural issues other than to leave one to wonder.
1,"""unfortunately shortsighted and knee jerk feminisim""",This book reads like the outpourings of a inteligent but immature girl who has read Cosmo too much and watched Titanic one time too many. Some idealistic but fanciful ideas based more on wishful thinking than proven social concepts.
3,I don't like wendy very much,"As someone very wise once said, ""the only thing more boring than someone who brags about how much sex they've had is someone who brags about how much sex haven't had."" why does Shalit deserve kudos for writing her book at such a young age? While I don't think the ""Don't knock it until you've tried it"" approach to sex is valid here, I do think it's gross for a prissy college grad to make far-reaching statements about societal ills and where their cures lie without knowing anything of societal ills herself."
2,Students of psychology reject it,"I am professor of psychology. I used this book in my personality class. There were about 60 women and 3 men in the class. The rejection of Shalit's ideas was total. This a new way to debase women. There has been much more violence toward women before, the students said, but it was hidden. I thought the class would kill me just for presenting Shalit's ideas."
1,Why is it one sided?,"The thing that gets to me the most is that Shalit believes that a return to modesty by women will correct all these wrongs in today's society. It is not a return to modesty she really desires, but a re-instatement of virtue. This cannot happen simply by wrapping women up in unrevealing clothes, but instead requires the education of MEN and the changing of MALE ideals. Too much concentration on what is wrong with women ignores the more important factor of the other sex. Miss Shalit also does not have the worldly experience to have a grounded opinion. Regardless of her young age, she appears to have never challenged her own views. If she had, she may have been able to make a more convincing and well rounded argument. As it is, she is simply regurgitating information she has gathered that explicitly supports her purpose."
3,Thought provoking and some very valid points,"The women's movement, which was designed to give women a more equal footing with men, has indeed resulted in an over-sexualization of women and a loss of femininity, and caused a whole other kind of harm to women. Although good things came from the women's movement - domestic violence and anti-stalker laws, better sexual assault laws (the victim used to have to prove herself innocent first), battered women's shelters, rape crisis centers, and opening doors to careers - we've also take a big step back, baby. Although I disagree with some of the writer's allegations such as eating disorders,(anorexia, for instance, was first identified in the 17th century) which often result from emotional or sexual abuse - it is indeed time for a return to some more traditional values. These days, the wages of sin is indeed death, and sex respect needs to be rekindled in younger generations of females. Modesty is indeed a virtue and it's time to rediscover it."
4,Outstanding analysis of an unnatural society,"Wendy Shalit has the gaul to speak out and challenge contemporary sexual society. She exposes a society which grades women by male standards, because being male is obviously more desirable. I am a 20 year old male and was inspired to find out how to act like a gentlemen (both socially and in spirit) by this book. Miss Shalit immodestly summarizes parts of the feminine mind and offers an eye opening and honest glance into the world of women and how they are treated. I heartily recommend this book to women who do not feel fulfilled as women, and to men who wish to both understand women and be real men."
1,This Book Is Not Based In Reality,"Wendy Shalit takes a one sided view of female sexuality and men,her perception is that of a young girl who believes every myth and sterotype about women.Women are the prey and men the preditors,women have this mythical oxitonsin which makes them vuneralble,it all makes me think that she can't imagine a woman being sexual and just plan enjoying it.Also the idea that the sexual revolution was only good for men,is obsurd,the sexual revolution freed women,it gave them more options and a much better sense of self and sexuality..and it wasn't any ""better"" in the 19th century,people have always been wild to some degree or another,even though no one was to talk about it..only real difference is that we talk about it now."
1,a naive and frightening attack on modern feminism,"bravo to bolshoi_otsa@hotmail.com for a very accurate interpretation of Shalit's book. After seeing her on C-span, I was impressed with how articulate she is but not with what she or her book has to say. Although it is IN THEORY a viable and interesting idea it promotes the sexual guilt that women in all religions have had to bear throughout history. As stated before, the way a woman dresses and conducts herself has nothing to do with date rape or rape. Rape is about power. Similarly eating disorders have less to do with body image than they do with control. Ms. Shalit should not be considered a modern feminist because her ideas are distinctly old fashioned. While I find nothing wrong with old fashioned ideals I have to remember that they obviously didn't work then, because here we are. Shalit also doesn't support birth control and sex education, and I have to wonder how much worse off we would be today, without them."
4,Modesty is Dignity,"Wendy Shalit argues that modesty is a natural virtue that protects women from being treated as sex objects by men and therefore leading to a loss of their dignity. She blames many problems in society including anorexia nervosa, date rape, stalking and self-mulitation to the loss of modesty that has occurred with the sexual revolution. I was, however, disappointed with the large amount of quotes from such magazines as ""Glamour"" and ""Seventeen."""
1,Hilariously self-congratulatory,"Now that no one reads Katie Roiphe or Elizabeth Wurtzel anymore the geniuses behind the bookselling business produce us the flip side of the coin: another smug and overprivileged young woman who thinks her shallow life experiences in elite schools qualifies her to make vast generalizations about American sexual culture. The only difference is that Shalit is attacking female promiscuity rather than praising it. Her self-congratulatory prose--particularly at the book's beginning--makes A RETURN TO MODESTY something of a camp classic (that title alone!).Here's a tip: if you're really interested in current sexual politics or in women and sexuality, try reading something by someone over thirty who has actually done some reading and research and who has spoken to women outside her immediate peer group and economic class. Shalit, like Roiphe and Wurtzel, is pretty thin stuff."
2,"Peek out from behind your veil, dear.","What sort of sheltered life has Ms. Shalit led? Reviewers give us some idea: born into academia, educated in a liberal arts ivory tower, and sprung fresh into the world, a fully grown messiah of a new feminism. Ms. Shalit's writing reflects her background: she reads texts well, and people badly. Her commentary on film and on intellectual debate, conservative and feminist alike, is extraordinarily sharp. However, when Ms. Shalit speaks of ""women"" and ""men,"" the abstractions she summons forth bear very little relation to the women and men I know. It's ironic that this neo-con prodigy, set to tear down the 60s and post-everything (feminism, modernism, etc.), is really, in the final tally, nothing more than a talented literary critic."
1,a return to man-pleasing ways.,"Get out your thumb-thick sticks, men, I guess you were right to begin with. I should just keep my mouth shut, wrap my body in cloth and get that clitorectomy we keep debating about. A Return to Modesty. Please. Not talking about sex to young women makes them think they are missing out on something very ""grown-up."" Remember why you started smoking? This book was obviously written by a woman who has yet to explore her own body."
5,Calm down!,"Easy there Johnathan Nitschke from California. Sour grapes can be very unhealthy. Don't get too stressed out. It's O.K. It's all good. This was an excellent book. Women, read it! You might learn something that could make you a much happier person. All this anger is very unhealthy."
3,"some good points, but...","As a conservative myself, I wanted to agree with everything Ms. Shalit wrote. But this young girl is so naive in the ways of biochemistry! She implores women to throw out the Prozac which makes them less 'feminine', less emotional. Does she even realize what Prozac is for? Men and women alike suffer from life-destroying clinical depression and chemical imbalances. Does she really want to see women lose their jobs because they threw out their prescibed medication and can no longer function in society?"
5,Essential reading for 20-something men & women,"Shalit's witty writing uncovers the excitement which comes with a God-honoring understanding of attraction & sex. I found this to be a page-turner -- with each chapter unveiling more of the mystery and excitement which come from unencumbered sex, love, and romance. She gives the subject justice and proclaims a series of revolutionary [but quite old] thoughts in a way that subtly shouts their truth. The best book I've read in a long time and a stimulating read.Also recommended as an accompaniment: ""The Closing of the American Mind"" by Allan Bloom."
5,"Incredibly funny, smart, and touching... An amazing listen!","My folks listened to the Chad Mitchell Trio when I was growing up and my dad had all these old original Trio records... this one was probably my favorite. Fondly associated with great childhood memories! Now that I'm an adult I can more fully appreciate the biting satire and hilarious lyrics present in almost all of their songs. The serious songs are haunting and touching as well. These guys have never put out a bad album. Another great one is ""Chad Mitchell Trio...In Action"", which contains the wonderful ""Story of Alice"" trilogy. Again, I have nothing but glowing things to say about this group."
4,Anything But Bitter,"This is pure 1960s close harmony folk singing. This album is representative of all their albums, containing a mix of traditional folk songs and humorous songs. ""The John Birch Society"" is an example of their political humor, which does have a liberal bias that you should expect in the '60s. ""An Unfortunate Man"" and ""A Great Historical Bum"" are excellent examples of their non-political humor. Unfortunately this album does not include ""The Ballad of Lizzie Borden."" If you like Folk music I can't believe you won't like The Chad Mitchell Trio, and ""At the Bitter End"" is a good album to get acquainted with."
2,"the recording they used is flawed with drop outs,","I have the original vinyl record, but am trying to preserve it, The sound quality of the download is marginal, there are numerous dropouts. The mixing was done poorly. I can only presume this was not made off the mastertape."
4,"McSe Core Exams : Examgear : 70-067, 70-068, 70-073, 70-098,","Solid exam preperation package. Software is easy to use & well documented. Adaptive exam style where you can't ""mark"" questions to return to later. Gives user a good idea how well they ""know"" the material. Also extensive practice exams. Of the amny certification prodicts I've used, this is one of the best."
5,The World Won't Like It!,"Kristi Karnopp, Wisconsin reader, 03/07/03:I read ""Today, Jesus Said"" and then gave it to my pastor for his opinion. He later said, ""Well...the world isn't going to like it. But! It's all scripture and ALL truth. I could find nothing wrong with it."" I believe I've found a truly anointed author and can't wait to read her next book interpreting The Revelation: ""Bind Up the Testimony, Seal the Law"""
4,Useful for High School Scene Study and Directing Projects,"These five short plays, which were originally produced at the Actors Theatre of Louisville, are great material for high school students. The casts range from two to five; the scripts are contemporary and unique, offering the actors opportunities for much interplay and range of emotion. They can be effective as a full evening of theatre or for scene study, directing projects, or competitions."
4,Nice and big,"If you want something with a lot of storage for necklaces this it it! Take the door off to hang it. The door with the mirror is most of the weight. The finish could have been better and thats why I gave it 4 stars. Its not bad but it I don't see 178 dollars worth of a product. This is definitely a supply and demand price point. Seriously... how many people do you know with something like this? If they have a big jewelry box its on the floor, and a smaller one is on the dresser or table. Wall mount is a smaller niche and they make up for that in price I guess."
1,beaware of the nail tip scratch your wall and not matching wall anchor,"While I was trying to mount the Jewelry mirror on the wall (doing some leveling and adjusting work), one of the tip of the nail which located at the edge and the back of the box made a lot of scratches on the wall. It is not supposed to be stick out from the box - badly quality control. After mounting the mirror on the wall, I found the two screws with the wall anchor is not really matched because the mirror was very loose on this two screws (no problem on the third screw because it was on the wall stud). I can easily take out the wall anchor after taking out the jewelry mirror and now I need to replace a better wall anchor and/or screw!! Finally, I made a call and nicely complain to the SEI and they hand up on me!!! Okay, the jewelry mirror may still good to use but just be aware the above problem."
4,Wow!!!,"I am a Fire Fighter and have been for 5 years and this is the coolest nozzle I have used on a garden hose ever!! This has all the options and more that a real fire hose nozzle has. The only CON is that you need a good deal of water pressure to use it, talking 80 pound per square inch or so. Other than that it is perfect!"
5,por eso es que funcionan los decretos de los Maestros Ascendidos!,"Gracias Padre Celestial por la Iluminación! La respuesta que tantas veces se busca....por que mis decretos no funcionan bien...Simplemente por que no estas haciendo los decretos de los Maestros Ascendidos, como bien te lo explica este libro en la página 103, (""Las palabras de un Maestro Ascendido llevan la totalidad del Patrón de Vida del Maestro Ascendido que las dictó. Por consiguiente, contienen la plena Victoria y Perfección de Maestro Ascendido""...) y teniendo tantos decretos realizados por los Maestros para toda situación por que primero no energizamos los mismos?"
3,dry and super simplistic,"i didn't really enjoy this one. it boils it down to very basic 3 word interpretations. it was so dry and it felt sort of gimmicky to me. i thought the point was to get a deeper understanding, not a surface level, quicky ""answer""."
3,Good However Older Works Better,"This Silber album is more alternative rock sounding deviating from the Neue Deutche Harte sound. Silber did this since they wanted it pure from the heart but results in not too original sound. This album killed the band pretty much since they had trouble getting a contract to release it and lagged in sales from lack of originality in sound. Not bad in fact the album is decent however their last album self titled ""Silber"" is in its own league. If you want something more American sounding you'll enjoy this then. If you're looking for the German NDH sound good luck finding their album ""Silber""."
5,Well made and easy to install,This pet door for slider is sturdy and well made. The adjustable height mechanism worked well. The installation process was pretty easy. The inclusion of the rubber sweeper and weather stripping helped maintain a pretty good air seal. Our dog and cat both use it and best of all I don't have to wake up in the middle of the night to animals asking to go out!
3,"Easy to Install, make sure to buy extra insulation","The good: easy to install, seems sturdy as it's lasted a month with my dog.The bad: Leaks like a sieve (as others have mentioned). Has dropped the temperature in that room by over 2 degrees even after I added extra seals/insulation. However, I live in Minnesota so this might not be that noticeable elsewhere.Also, lock mechanism didn't match up with my door. This might be because my door is wooden instead of aluminum? I jury-rigged a way to latch my door with the frame (bypassing the pet door).Unfortunately. there aren't many choices in the ""pet doors for sliding glass door"" market. It's not perfect, but it does what it needs to do."
4,Door Saver,"Door is great, but could use a little bit more on the sealing...had to buy extra seal for the other side of door. Other then that it has been great for my two dogs which can now come and go as they please, and for us that no longer have to get up to let the dogs out. I would but this door again if I needed another one."
2,Wouldn't work with our sliding glass door,"I bought this for my parents because they are watching my Westie for me for the summer. This product wouldn't work with the newer sliding glass door they have. It looks like its a quality product, but I'm not sure how I could have known it wouldn't fit before I bought it. I'm disappointed because I think it would have been really nice to have!"
1,Doesn't fit in replaced/new sliding glass door,"If this panel compressed another 1/2 inch, then I'd be able to get it over the lip of my door. According to the dimensions of the panel, this should fit...the tracks in my new sliding glass door are about 77"", but the lips are too tall and the panel cannot make it over.I replaced my sliding glass door a year ago with new vinyl doors, complete with dual-pane and argon gas (which helps in winter and summer as advertised), but these have big lips to hold the glass in place...hence the problem. Petsafe does not seem to have a smaller panel or a custom fit. Guess I'll look at a competitor..."
1,Very annoyed,"I bought a Petsafe Large Tall Deluxe Patio Panel for my dog. On the outside label it says that 1/8 inch, and 7/32 inch drill bits are needed for installation. I wasted an hour going out and buying the drill bits and when, today (Sunday), I take the wrap off the door to begin installation, the instruction manual says that I will need 1/4 inch and 9/64 inch drill bits!!! Not the 1/8 inch and 7/32 inch drill bits as stated on the outer label of the package! Not only that but the 7/64 inch drill bit that is supposed to be included was left out and so did not come with the rest of the door components. What kind of ""quality product"" is this?"
2,This door ISN'T for large tall dogs,"Although the idea of this door is a good one, the dimensions are not made for large/tall dogs. We have a 90# greyhound, just under 30"" at the shoulder. According the the description of this door, my dog should be able to fit through this door with ease. After installing the door it became apparant that there is no way that my dog will fit through this door. The top of the door flap comes 25"" from the ground and the door is only 10"" wide by 15"". If my dog, who is quite tall and thin could not get through this door, there is no way a 100# thicker dog could get through this door. I am disappointed because it's a lot of money to spend to be too small for a ""large-tall"" dog."
4,"Great for dogs, weather stripping needs upgrade","Everything as advertised. Easy to install.Easy to teach dogs (2 Jack Russells, 1 Shih-tzu)how to use it. Oldest is 14, youngest 8 so old dogs can learn new tricks!Only complaint is the amount of cold air it lets in. First, expect to use your own foam weather stripping between existing and new door. The stuff that comes with this door is pretty thin.I like the magnetic ""latch"" that holds the door in place when it's closed. BUT, there is quite a bit of gap that remains when it's closed and cold air pours in. Only an issue in winter in South Dakota.Willing to trade that for accidents though!Overall, worth the money. Best option for our situation."
4,Works great!,This is a great quality door. My husband watched the installation video online before installing it and was able to do it quite quickly without too much of a hassle. The only problem we had is that the adhesive on the seal part wasn't strong enough and it fell off about an hour after it was installed. We had to buy extra strength double sided tape to make it stick.
4,great buy,"This doggie door saved my dogs from being given away. Its a great product and I have seen it for much more at petsmart, walmart and every where else i looked."
