5,Simply the best!!!!,I'm an avid NR reader and this is truly my favorite one ever!!! I was so in to the story that I just couldn't put the book down for 2 whole days! A MUST read to all romantic fans!
2,Honest Illusions by Nora Roberts,I am having a hard time getting through this novel. There is such a long flashback of the youth of the main characters that I'm not enjoying it as much as I usually do her novels.
3,not so great,"This is one of my least favorite Nora Roberts books. It's not my least favorite, but one of the bottom five. I recommend instead her Three Sisters triology. They were all great!"
5,The best of all of Nora's books!,"If I could give this book 10 stars, I definitely would. This is the BEST that Nora's written. I've read this book three times and fall in love with the story and the characters all over again each time I read it. I love how Max teaches Luke to trust again after his unhappy childhood. I love how they don't want to steal from the people on the cruise because they fall in love with them, too. This is one book I didn't want to end. I just adored every minute of this book. I wish it could be a movie -- how charming."
3,NOT REALLY A ROMANCE---,"This was more of a saga about a family of famous magicians, who were also accomplished thieves. (Hard to root for the bad guys.) It mainly consisted of EXTREMELY detailed accounts of their trials, tribulations and heartaches. It had a few enjoyable moments but was drawn out WAY too long."
4,Best overall book on water,"This book covers all aspects of water on planet Earth; from physical properties to human drama, abundance to dehydration, and facts to emotions. I utilize it as a text in my middle school classroom.The pictures are as thought provoking as the words. It is these photos that enthrall my students."
5,Love it,always a big fan of VS Love Spell. Ran out of lotion so ordered more. As described ad awesome. Would recommend.
1,"Good product, Wierd customer/product policy","The USPS does not deliver mail to my rural area so they provide a free post office box. This product was somehow sent to my home address so I assumed it would be sent back. I emailed the company to tell them it would be sent back to them and to ask how I should handle it to get it sent back to me. I was willing to pay the shipping again. But, they told me that they would have to charge me a 're=stocking fee'. Maybe I can charge them a 'I had to open the package fee'. Pfff"
3,"Yeah, Alright","The candy is basically a hard caramel that wraps around a creamy, light, chocolate center. It is very chewy. It is sweet, but not excessively sweet - though it might be bordering there. Three out of five stars for me as I do not have any nostalgia for this product. I'm surprised that these got mostly five stars from people."
3,Not her best,"I feel this is kind of a set back after the great development We could listen to in ""Shonen Alice"" where not only the lyrics and the music, but Maaya's voice sounds more mature than it does here. I feel ""Loop"" is nearer to ""Hotch potch"", and it's the most J-popsey She's done since then (Sweet pitched, happy sounding songs). It *IS* noticeable the lack of Kanno, very much.Chances are you'll still love her, because, chances are that you think of her not as a singer but as an *Anime* singer, and this does indeed sound Anime-y, which is not bad, but I miss the maturity her music had gained since Easy Listening, Shonen Alice & Nikopachi.Oh, and the art is not as good either."
4,Excellent book - full of information,"I've had a copy of The Save Your Life Diet book by David Reuben, MD., for years. I am a snowbird and have decided that it would be easier to buy duplicates of my most favored books than transportating them back and forth from place to place twice a year, hence the purchase of this one. The book itself is full of important information on high fiber diet living written long before the current ""trend"" became so well known. There are some excellent high fiber recipes in the book. I do my own modifications to recipes calling for some items; for sugar I substitute local honey, for milk I use low fat soy milk, for butter I use high heat organic canola oil for recipes calling for heat over 350 degrees, or extra virgin olive oil for those under 350 degrees."
2,PARTICLES in MATTIQUE,"I bought seven bottles of L'Oreal Mattique as I can no longer find it anywhere. The first bottle I opened has particles throughout the liquid in the bottle. It's a pain to have to flick them off into a tissue. This NEVER happened when I could readily find L'Oreal Mattique retail. I am very disappointed. I'll try one of the other bottles to see if the same problem exists there. I find myself not using it. I wasted my money. Before it had been discontinued, it had been my very favorite makeup--non-oily, beautiful shade (Pale), and it was the one my dermatologist recommended. I have found nothing like it in any other makeup brand. I loved it. Because it has been discontinued, maybe this is very old, stale makeup, and the particles would be what happens with stale, old makeup. I wish I could get my money back."
3,"The last sentence should be "" to be continued""","One of the books in which every thing seems to be so perfect and good ,but in the end everything is ruined.It is one of the book, which I never wanted to end.It justs need a little sentence in the end and that is ""to be continued"" ."
3,Cousin 90 days you might still be reading,"It took me several months to finish this rather short book. The plot is fairly simple with nary a twist, the characters admirable but somewhat one-dimensionable. It seems to be an ode to conservatism--a longing for the ""peace of the old days."" As a fan of 19th century English lit, this left me wondering why Elizabeth Gaskell is considered a classic writer; admittedly I haven't read some of her better known works such as ""North and South."""
2,Cranford paperback,"I received the book quickly, which I was grateful for as I needed it for a literature course. However, yellowing pages on paperbacks always make it less than a pleasure to read because it feels like the book is disintegrating in one's hands. The fact that there was 'slight' yellowing was mentioned, but it was more than expected and I think when a person is willingness to purchase a book with any yellowing, this should be reflected in the seller's price, i.e. cheaper, which it was not."
4,Beautiful coffee-table book,"This volume translates twelve of the hymns of the Rig-Veda, printing one quatrain per page and alternating text and photographic pages. The quatrain is presented both in the original (Vedic) Sanskrit and in English. The result is a beautiful, meditative book that is only mildly an introduction to Vedic literature. As such I recommend it highly; as an introduction to the Vedas, I would refer you to Wendy D. O'Flaherty."
5,Lovely!,"This one is sweet, fruity fresh. This range is very rich and moisturizing. It stays on you till the end of the day. The smell lingers on you and the room for quite a while. Lovely."
4,Another childhood favorite!,"This was one of my favorite childhood books - read over and over again. I'd lost track of my copy, so was excited to find it still available! It arrived quickly and in great shape. I've already read it a couple times and it will remain in my collection of ""favorites""!"
2,"Boring, dumb story","I was trying to find a doctor book to go with my son's doctor kit christmas present and so I thought I would try this one out. It is so boring and dumb that I couldn't bring myself to even give it to my son. It is about a boy who keeps getting bandaids for everyone's owies. Yes, that pretty much sums it up. There is no more to the story than that and nothing at all relatable to being a doctor."
1,"Children Playing with Guns (not recommended for schools, etc.)","I bought this for my preschool class (along with Doctor Maisy, Corduroy Goes to the Doctor, etc.) for our doctor's office theme based on the good reviews, the low price, and the description on Amazon. I didn't see the reviews that mentioned the guns in the story - I wish I had read more of the reviews, because I can't use it in my class due to the children playing with toy guns on the first few pages."
5,"A tender, sweet story","Just would like to say that this story is wonderful in its portrayal of a boys being boys, a mother who has time, a brother who loves, plays with, and helps his little sister, and a Dad who indulges the eager interest of his young son (even if it costs him 10 minutes on the lawn job). My children love this story and don't think ""mom"" and ""dad"" are doing anything unusual--as has been suggested in some reviews. (too old fashioned in its view) The only exception is that Dad is using a funny looking lawn mower which only opens the door for some interesting conversation when the story is over. I highly recommend it!"
1,ew,"...not only sexist, weirdly ominous with the injuries, and sister's panties are showing, but most annoyingly its a rather long adverstisement for band-aids (early product placement for children?). I'm glad I don't live in the 50s, or whatever this is depicting."
4,"The best ""stock"" I've found in the grocery store","I have been on a soup-making kick for awhile now, and while I much prefer to make my own chicken stock, I do it so rarely that it turns directly into chicken soup. So I bought various chicken stocks, mostly organic, and really started to notice a difference in the resulting soups. I began to pay more attention to the stocks I was using: color, saltiness, depth. Kitchen Basics is the hands-down winner and I cannot use anything else now. It's not bright, scary yellow, but a darker, deeper color. The flavor and smell really does come across as natural, and it's not really salty tasting.I did put ""stock"" in quotes only because I'm still confused about it being stock if it doesn't have that gelatinous texture when it cools, but I do not know of any stock you can purchase that has that. If anyone does, please share!"
3,Great Examples and a fun review,My team enjoyed this. What was beneficial were the quirky examples. It felt a little long but overall a good item to have in ones library of training material.
5,Outstanding southern rap tune,"Outkast's 3rd single off ""Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik"", ""GIt Up, Git Out"" is probably my favorite. This single features Goodie Mob, and man, do they ever shine. The first verse by Cee-Lo the self-proclaimed soul machine is one that you would want to hear over and over, and Big Gipp tears it up on the 3rd verse. Not to say that Outkast isn't ill on this track, Big Boi & Dre rip it up on the 2nd and last verses respectively. The mid-tempo beat is one that you can just lay back and chill to, and the guitars in the very catchy hook add a nice effect too. Though this song is VERY long, at 7:27, it's also a VERY good southern rap tune, and one of my favorite songs from all time. Be sure to check out the full-length album, ""Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik""."
1,Did not like the cookbook,"I love Farm Journal Cookbooks, so I was very disappointed with this one. I collect cookbooks, especially the ones from the 50's and 60's so I was excited to get this one. The recipes are not appetizing and use way too much canned and boxed food, with very little fresh ingredients. I was hoping there would be recipes using leftovers or precooked meat and there are none. I have ""Pilsbury's Creative Cooking In Minutes"" and Betty Crocker's Family Dinners In a Hurry"" from around the 70's which have more appealing recipes, which I have tried and have liked. One sample recipe in this cookbook is for Chili Mac Casserole which uses one can of chili and cooked macaroni combined and baked in the oven for 20 minutes. Now, I like easy, but this goes way overboard. Most of the recipes are like this. There were only a handful of recipes I would actually make, and they were mostly chicken recipes. I do not part with any of my 250 plus cookbooks, but this one is not staying."
1,Poor scholarship,"I have often enjoyed this author's work; however, this time I believe that the author uses her evangelical Christianity to mask unexamined prejudices. I believe that, in this book, the author uses holy scripture and psuedo-intellectual gloss rather than rigorous scholarship to discuss race, gender, sexuality and the church. I find her arguments on sexuality shamefully dismissive. I hope that the author will reconsider this work."
4,"Great bag, not so easy to access your stuff once it's in it though...","Pros: I got this bag mainly because I needed somewhere to put my MacBook in. And for that, it's great! There's an inner pouch where you can keep your computer and it can be removed for those times when you're not carrying it around.Cons: The thing is that because of the way it's designed a lot of stuff can go in it (trust me), it's just difficult to access it afterwards. The material is also rather hard, so you better have flexible fingers and a lot of patience. Other pro: Water proof too! I just went snowboarding with it and it did the job very nicely. Didn't bother me once. Nice ergonomic shape.Pretty cool all in all. I'll still use my old JanSport for everything else though..."
3,"Great construction, storage not thought out","Although the bag is wonderfully constructed and fit very well, there is no place to store a file folder."
5,"liked it, loved it, want some more of it","I always wanted to get this movie but never could find it in stores.That's one of the many things I love about amazon, I usually can always find exactly what I'm looking for.Anyways the movie of course. ^^Its a great comedy, very dark, very elegant, and very disturbing at some points. If your similar to me a normal person and like to collect certain movies like edward scissor hands, beetlejuice, the goonies and such then this one is for your collection! I enjoyed it when I was a kid and enjoy just as much now! Its still got it. Goes to show you how vengefully crazy some people can get, and how very fragile we actually are."
4,Movies,I loved this movie! I hadn't seen it in years but what a funny movie to look back on. Great investment into a movie collection.
4,Goofy But Funny,"This movie is pretty goofy and far-fetched. But it's very funny. It's about a woman who goes insane after she loses another man to the same hot-shot broadway star woman. About 14 years later she gets an amazing makeover from a mystical potion and tracks down the woman. But she has taken the potion too. The potion restores youth and beauty and makes their bodies invincable to death. Causing them to live forever. Their violent and deadly cat-fights do no good to enflict pain in each other. This movie contains lots of dark humor, drama, and suspense. It reminds me of ""She-Devil"", ""Fatal Attraction"", and ""The War Of The Roses"". All in one."
1,Wait for a Special Edition,"I wish this DVD had the trailer. I worked in a cinema when it came out and the trailer had Tracy Ullman (as a bartender?)in several cut scenes about Bruce Willis' character being ""dead"" (which I assume was at/after the Party).I'll wait for a better edition and I suggest you do so as well."
5,Death,"What a great film with such good people in it. Meryl Streep is great like always and Goldie Hawn is funny as well. Isabella Rossellini is also good in this. I didn't even recongize her from ""Blue Velvet."" Death Becomes Her is really funny and wicked. The two ladies both die but come back to life with different problems and Bruce Willis is the guy caught in the middle of it all. There is nothing bad I can say about ""death."" It's a must see film. When I saw it in the store when I was younger, I always thought it was a horror film. Boy was I real off about that."
1,Great Movie - Lousy DVD,"I have to admit that I goofed when I purchased this DVD. I NEVER buy panned and scanned movies and haven't for many years. If I had paid attention, I would have realized that this is not the full widescreen movie that I expected and I would never have purchased it.Having said that, I also have to say that I LOVE this movie. It has a very funny story line with excellent makeup and special effects. Goldie Hawn, Meryl Streep and Bruce Willis are excellent in their roles. I would love to have the actual (as opposed to the chopped off panned and scanned version) in my video library.The picture quality of this DVD is terrible. You might as well have it on VHS tape or just watch the cable listings to catch it some time.If you love this movie, as I do, DO NOT BUY THIS DVD."
5,"Don't Wait For The Widescreen Edition, Buy This One!","This is one of the finest black comedies ever made, on a par with Alfred Hitchcock's ""The Trouble With Harry"", or Stanley Kubrick's ""Dr. Strangelove"". The special effects achieve hilarious comedic moments throughout the film.Much thanks to the review by R. Whitney regarding the fact that the movie was fimed using a ""soft"" matte, meaning that the aspect ratio for the DVD of 1.33 to 1 actually shows MORE of the movie than a widescreen version would. Many of Stanley Kubrick's films have been released the same way. Judging by many of the other reviews for this movie, I believe many people don't understand that they are actually getting more for their money by buying this version of the film."
5,CLASSIC!,I've loved this movie since I was a child (don't ask... for whatever reason I've watched it at least a million times starting at 6). It was a family fave. Glad to have it back in my possession. So unique. Nothing like a good old 90's sinical thriller/dark comedy. It's good every time. And the 'special' effects aren't too shabby for the era. Disc was in great conditioner and it came on time.
5,Death Becomes Her,Death Becomes Her is an oldie but a goodie. Even my 9 year old grandson loved it. I would say this one stands the test of time but I would love to see it remade.
3,Funny but not Widescreen,"This is a great movie and I just saw it again on HBO in Wide-screen format. I decided to purchase the DVD but could not find it in Wide-screen, only in Full-screen format. I checked Blue Ray but it isn't available in that format at all. Anyone know if the Wide-screen version is available anywhere, besides HBO?"
1,Horrible!,"This movie was so awful and so unbeliveable.....can they write something that affects people these days? This movie doesn't even come close to dealing with what's going on in the world today....next time I see a movie with either one of these actresses, I better make sure the critics say something positive about it!.....I will never watch this movie again"
4,Elvis isn't dead,"Elvis isn't dead, he just snuck out of hiding for a cheeseburger. I loved the idea of stars secretly in hiding after sipping a potion that gives 'eternal life'. This is a great comedy. The sparring between Streep and Goldie is full of hilarity.Chrissy K. McVay - Author"
3,A black comedy that is not really entertaining,"A black comedy that is not really entertaining. . .The special effects are very good--e.g., a woman with a huge gunshot opening through her stomach. Other than that, I find the movie grotesque without being really entertaining."
5,Death Becomes Her,"EXCELLENT MOVIE, NOTHING LIKE LIFE AFTER DEATH! GOLDIE HAWN PLAYS A VERY GOOD PART IN THIS VERY FUNNY MOVIE! EXCELLENT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,"A very good movie, terrible DVD video transfer.","This is a very enjoyable movie that is hurt by a terrible transfer to DVD. It looks a though the publisher used a VHS casette to make the DVD master. Until they release a decent DVD version, just by the VHS casette (or the Laser Disc, if you can find one)."
4,I love movies.,I love movis with Bruce Willis. I almost forgot about this movie but when I found it again I decided to buy it so I can watch it whenever I like.
4,Good movie,"I love this movie! However I was kind of disappointed when I realized this movie is Full Screen format and not Widescreen. So to watch it on my tv I zoom it in so that it takes up the whole screen without the people looking stubby, but it's not very HD. Besides that the movie is pretty decent quality."
1,this edition not for the collector,"I LOVE this movie, however, I'm still waiting for a widescreen edition. No true collector of movies would waste their time on this edition of such a beautifully shot and directed (and funny) film. I pray the day comes soon when this film is presented as the director intended."
3,death becomes her,"I knew what to expect from the movie, my kids love it. But it took a long time to arrive and I was afraid it wouldn't make it for Christmas"
3,Time between,Not laugh out loud humor but has its funny moments. I had seen this years ago and I just had to see it again. I remembered the ending when the two woman fall apart from the potion they took which was for eternal youth. Worth seeing once and then not again for a while.
5,Seeking Eternal life?,This movie portrays perfectly the vanity of women and the desire of all man kind to live forever. It is both funny and romantic yet has so many unexpected twists.....an oldie but a goodie
3,See right thru Hawn,"3 of 5 stars for the comedy movie Death Becomes Her. How can you not like a movie where Goldie Hawn walks around with a shotgun made hole thru her tummy--yep, you can see right through it. Oh, and when she sits down on a couch and the long wooden handle from a tool pokes right thru. This is a star packed movie (Willis, Hawn, Streep and Caine). The story line is that Hawn & Streep want to drink a ""foutain-of-youth"" potion (from Isabelle Rossellini). They both need Willis to do ""make-up"" and body repairs. Ultimately the girls decide the Willis needs to live forever also to continue taking care of them. Well, Willis has other ideas. This is a well written movie. Well acted and richly photographed. Funny and worth watching!"
3,funny and fun,A hilarious comedy that rests entirely on the shoulders of its stars; Meryl Streep is superb (when is she not?) and is matched in intensity and humour by Goldie Hawn. Bruce Willis is really great in his turn as a comedic actor. this is not a masterpiece by any means but it is a fun and a funny movie to watch nevertheless.
3,DVD Issue !!,First it's not widescreen format as many people mentioned.Second it's two channel. Actually 2.1 channel which is really bothering me since it's a science fiction film.Hope some day the dvd will be remastered and re-release.
4,"Interesting presentation, well delivered...","Interesting video that shows Hopkins delivering a motivating, rousing presentation in a very professionally-shot video that's worth getting. This would be a perfect video to show to your sales team to get them a bit more motivated about selling, and to review some of Tom's classic verbal sales counters and alternative phrases.I've enjoyed learning from Tom's training for many many years, it's nice to see him in a modern video shoot in an upscale presentation format. Excellent value since also provides an audio CD in addition to the DVD. Slick production.This would be something I as a sales manager would want to have on my shelf, to show to my sales team.. then have them role-play out alternatives and customized phrases for specific selling situations. Nice work."
5,"Great bookends but,,,,","Fine bookends, but when I went back to the page because I wanted to order again, the price actually DOUBLED.Whats up with that??"
2,"gray bookends - not like on the picture, and not like the black bookends","I read the reviews and the description for the black bookends, but picked the gray ones as it seemed to me that they was no difference between them, and I liked better that dark gray color that you see on the pictures.I received the bookends (very fast, I must say) last night and was disappointed at their color, for it is light gray, almost white.this morning when I put them on my bookshelf, surprise! there is no padded base! which, on my slippery shelf, doesn't make the books stable at all, and this is a problem because the shelf is on the wall, over the door."
3,It;s good but --,"If I had seen the Eldon Premium tall bookends first , I probably would not not have bought these but the feature of the extensions are still a strong selling point."
4,Pretty good for cheapies,"Not bad. They do their job, and that's all I ask. These are great if you are looking for something merely practical and not decorative."
3,A good debut album but suffers from terrible sound quality.,"This was Tommy Olivencia's first album and featured the lead vocals of Chamaco Ramirez and Paquito Guzman. While the music itself is very good, the sound quality is just terrible. This CD was poorly remastered from an LP (clicks, pops and vinyl surface noise are ever-present)."
5,immortal beloved,"I only wish more people could view this and pay attention to the very beginning, then they would understand the whole true story. The Beloved, (soon to be his bethrothed), whispered ""I am pregnant"" in his ear. BUT...He was going deaf and never heard her whisper that. That explains why he mistreated her all of her life. At the end, he finds out about it was HIS lovechild and it is too late.....What a fabulous movie!!!!Arrived safely, in perfect condition and I have watched it many times..MUSIC is divine..."
3,More theories on Beethoven's life,"A lot of people love this movie, for me is very good and well acted but I find other movies on the theme better, like Copying Beethoven, is a matter of opinion. Gary Oldman rocks as the man, one of his finest performances. and the overall story is good but a little to fanciful to my taste. Is a respecful portrayal of the master and his times."
4,"Beautiful color, wonderful story.","The blu-ray transfer on ""Immortal Beloved"" is excellent. Everything is distinctly clear, and the colors are vivid. The acting is very good. Story is touching with a great ending. Keeps you guessing. Recommended."
4,reviewer,**Actual Review Written over 7 Years Ago; Amazon changed the review date.If you look at this as a biography you may be disappointed.If you look at this as a movie you will probably be pleased.A great movie.
1,arrived scachted,"disc arrived badly scatched and will not play. trying to clean surface to get to play in dvd player, before returing."
5,musical treat,"Whether it was completely historically accurate or not, this film gave a balanced picture of a difficult man and a troubled life. The music he created was so splendid that one would want to think he was deeply happy. But his music came at the expense of his peace. The film was very nicely done!"
4,Imaginative and great performances,"In this fictional reconstruction of Beethoven's life, we will learn of the drama of misunderstanding his beloved (who is it?), caused by an abusive youth which impaired his communication skills with words. How Beethoven struggled with his gift as a music composer, while losing his hearring and showing the shallow admiration at his death of a man which was hard to live with.The performances of two Dutch actors Jeroen Krabbe and Johanna ter Steege is sublime, next to Gary Oldman and Isabella Rossellini.A thrilling love story with a surprise ending."
2,Wasted Opportunity,"Sophomoric and totally non-historic. This is an almost OK movie about one of the greatest men who ever lived. Beethoven's life is too important to let this movie rest as his biography on film. Nobody who knows anything about Beethoven the man or about Beethovens music could like this movie. The three women in question weren't even contenders, especially his sister-in-law Johanna, who he despised. Beethoven is written as a freakish eccentric. Gary Oldman's performance is superficial and cartoonish. The sets are nice, the costumes are nice, the music is nice, but so what? You get that in any period film. The greatest composer of all time deserves a great movie honoring his life. Oh please God, give us a second chance!"
3,"Great actor, awful plot.","Honesetly speaking, I love this film only because I am a great fan of Gary Oldman. His performance is powerful and adorable, and you will be helplessly fallen in love with HIS Beethoven. Yet, back to the movie and the plot...Hm. You have to admit, you just don't know why people would like to romanticise historical figure and make a great artist to be a character in those soap opera. Hm. No offense but this movie, to a certain extent, make things so superficial. The psychological twist of Beethoven's immortal beloved is omitted- everything was then become so awkward, and I can't help wondering whether or not shall I continue the movie~Just watch the performance of Gary, and forget everything about the plot. Sigh."
3,"The movie is great!!!!, but the shippment stinks","The movie is great, gary oldman is wow, the story is exceptional, I can give my comments cause I've already seen this movie before, but I haven't recived my movie, is it funny? is not, I placed in January 22 and was sent January 24, we'are march 2, I know it's an international Shippment but the order is delayed."
2,Terrible film--buy the soundtrack instead,"I don't really care how accurate it is biographically; I wanted to be entertained with a good story. This isn't it. It wanders all over the place. The premise is ripped off from Citizen Kane (detectivey-person must talk to surviving loved ones to find out a Big Secret about the Big Man), and it takes forever, goes off down a million side roads that are never resolved or resolved with a big thud. This Beethoven isn't a likable guy--unlike the film character of Amadeus, who was a spoiled brat but still kind of fun and sympathetic, Beethoven is a self-centered, sadistic monster, plain and simple. A single redeeming quality in him--or anyone--would have carried this film a long way. The Ode to Joy at the end is very well done, and the only reason I bumped this film up to 2 stars."
2,not entertaining,"First let me say that i am a composer and die hard musician. i just watched this movie to learn what i could about this supposed genius, and i could barely keep from turning it off, actually, i did turn it off. quite unattractive really. turns out Beethoven was an insane jerk and his lifestlye was not intersting to me at all. he may have been a great musician, but that is not really the focus of this movie. in fact, there is no focus in this movie, except that he was a jerk.If you want to watch a great movie about a great man, I suggest the ""The Endurance"". Enrest Shackleton will make you want to punch people like this Beethoven character. It will blow you away."
1,Do not believe this movie.,"This movie is totally garbage. Not one thing in this movie is historically correct. This does not come close to the other composer movie ""Amadeus"" which depicts Mozarts life. Do not come out of watching it thinking you learned something of Beethoven, except how his music sounds. It is obvious that the writers didn't consult any of the numerous historians that focus on Beethoven alone. As a music major, I am completely disgusted with this film"
1,This is not Beethoven....,"Beethoven is one of my favorite composers. I took an extensive Music Course dedicated to this fantastic composer. As much as I like Gary Oldman's acting, I could barely watch this film. This is not his life, this woman was not his love, this is NOT Beethoven. Watch Amadeus if you want to see a great film about a great composer. Another reviewer wrote that Beethoven deserves the same treatment as Mozart got in Amadeus. He absolutely does. He was a tremendous man, complex and misunderstood, but beloved by the ALL of Europe by the time of his death. His memory still awaits a film dedicated to his real life and tumultuous, brilliant, disturbed life.Better spend your time watching something else."
4,An interesting speculation movie,"Have you ever seen Amadeus? If you have, then you've basically seen the plot and style of this movie. This movie tries to re-create the life of Beethoven from his youth to his death and speculates on his love life, the ""Immortal Beloved"" in some of his writings.I don't want to give the plot secrets away, but you'll find the way that the pieces connect intriguing. It has you wondering for most of the film. And the director tries to weave together the music Beethoven creates with the events in his life, and the Beloved. To me, that was a bit of a stretch.One area the movie handles very well is the descent of Beethoven's mood and demeanor as he becomes increasingly deaf and frustrated. The only mistake (but you'll understand why they did it) that I know of is in handling the first performance of the 9th symphony. But it is forgivable. :-)Overall, this is a good movie, and a bit romantic. If you enjoy classical music you'll have an extra bit of enjoyment."
2,Not so great,"While watching this, I couldn't help feeling that the director was TRYING to make a masterpiece, rather than actually produce one. The acting is good, but not extraordinary. As far as the actual shots and music editing, I felt as though I was watching a made-for-TV movie. Many times throughout the movie, Beethoven's glorious music was just playing in the background, with no connection to the story. Absolutely poor music editing! Come on now, Beethoven deserves nothing less than brilliance..."
5,I loved this movie,I have to say that I absolutely loved this movie. It reaches every emotion and the music is beautiful. A must see.
5,Immortal Gary Oldman,"It's been a while since I have seen this movie. But it still resonates within me. Gary Oldman is one of my absolute favorite actors, and this movie is a testament to his abilities. Powerful, beautiful, classical. I loved this movie!"
5,The torment and the genious,When he died and left a love letter to his immortal beloved ... no one was quite sure who the person was. A semi-autobiographical tale of the mysterious muse whose identity died with its admirer.
3,Who really was Beethoven?,"A moving, visual masterpiece, but a little hard to follow. Also, the movie makers took some obvious liberties as far as telling the true story. Still, Oldman's acting, over the top as usual, is well done in the title role. Isabella Rosellini is also excellent. A little on the disturbing side (scenes of a young Beethoven's abuse at the hands of his alcoholic father) but very touching. And, the soundtrack, of course, is great."
5,Quantitative Evaluation,Video Merits:9/10; Audio Merits:8/10; Musical Merits:10/10; Cinematographic Merits:8/10; Overall Artistic Performance:10/10;DVD Extras:8/10; Recording Total Quality:9/10. Professor's Recommendation: Beethoven- Sir George Solti-Gary Oldman and B.Rose tetralogy yields a magnificient title.
5,A true mystery,"I am not amazed that this movie, after 13 years, continues to be one that continues to get such great notice. The life of Beethoven is one that will always get much attention from anyone involved in music, and this movie brilliantly depicts one of the greater mysteries of the Master's life. Will we ever truly know who the ""Immortal Beloved"" really was? There are several theories, and candidates, as to who this woman really was, and some claim Karl is the son of Beethoven by his sister-in-law; however, has it ever been proven?This movie creates in the viewer a frustration every time the Immortal Beloved is briefly glimpsed, shrouded in her veils, coming and going. Frustration develops and grows with every near miss Beethoven has in meeting his lover, a frustration the viewer keenly feels. This is done so well the viewer develops an understanding of the angst Beethoven himself felt in loving a woman he could not have.This is a movie I highly recommend for any Beethoven fan."
4,Gary Oldman does it again!,"This was a fantastic film, though, it was not as great as expected. Gary Oldman(Bram Strokers Dracula), of course, delivers noting less then a five-star performance! Powerful soundtrack, and interesting theory as to who was the Immortal Beloved - which still remains a mystery to this day. This film has its ups and downs, as does Amadeus - which makes it hard to pick 'the best'. I say they're both equally good. They just have different approaches to telling the story. But once again, It's Gary Oldman's performance as Beethoven, that really makes this film powerful, and you should check it out just for that reason! I highly recommend."
4,Romantic,"This movie, although grossly misintreprets parts of beethovens life, is not intended to be a play by play biography. Many of the factors about beethoven's life were kept true to form but others, as with all hollywood film, were fictionalized to make an interesting show. That it did. It is a wonderful romance movie with a very unexpected ending."
1,A Missed Opportunity - A reluctant 1-Star,"What a sad treatment for such a master! Beethoven was perhaps one of the most interesting people who ever lived and deserves (at least) the treatment that Mozart received in ""Amadeus."" The angle used in ""Immortal Beloved"" was so weak, it doesn't even come close to depicting the Maestro as he deserves. His story doesn't even need an angle. Just a straight-forward bio would have served his memory better; he was tempestous, egotistical, deaf and brilliant! This film is a dog. Please, someone, make a good movie about this great genius!"
4,Great,"This Movie is great! This Movie makes me Love Beethoven's Music Even more, it also makes me understand more about Beethoven's music ."
3,Critical Mass Under Football Stadium,This book didn't add anything I didn't already know about the Manhattan Project. Its DOE presentationis a black and white format including hard to see photos..lose lips sink ships-era!
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"The book is factually inaccurate, poorly written in various passages and didn't provide additional insights that one might expect from a book written recently."
4,Great item for Doctor Who fans.,Sounds and looks just like the 9th and 10th Doctor's sonic screwdriver. UV pen does dry up pretty quickly though.
5,Doctor Who,"I bought this as a birthday present for my husband, as he's developed quite an interest in the tv show. The sound effects are spot on, sounding just like the effects in the show. He's having a blast with this."
2,"Sonic Screwdriver - fun idea, but...","Got this as a gift for my husband, not as a child's toy. It has sat in the box since. It looks and feels very cheap, I'm not exactly strong & it felt like about to break when I tried to manipulate it so would probably not last long at all with a child. I see I've put 3 stars for durability by mistake & it won't let me edit. We haven't bothered to try to use it except for a couple of minutes on opening so I can't speak to durability but I don't expect much from the cheap flimsy feel of it! The sound effect is just a very weak buzz, we both said ""that was it??"" It's not even nice to use as a pen. It may end up on eBay but the buyer would probably want his money back! I'd say it's one of those things that seems like a fun idea but very disappointing in its execution & don't waste your money!"
1,sonic- waste,"What i ordered was the tenth doctors sonic screwdriver that extended with uv light,sound,and 2 different pen caps what i recieved was a tenth doctor sonic screwdriver flashlight with no pen and from the package discription no sound as i wouldnt be able to tell because it was cracked and doesn't do anything."
1,What IS this?!,"This screwdriver is the wrong one! It looks nothing like the one in the picture, it doesn't make the noise, extend, OR have a pen installed or have the pen tips! Even the packaging it came in looked nothing like in the pictures and description! I am INCREDIBLY disappointed and angry that I paid about $20 for a cheap piece of plastic that does nothing but shine a light! I would return it immediately if my brother hadn't cut open the plastic by mistake. It barely weighs an ounce!A warning to everyone who plans to order this, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE do NOT open the plastic if you ordered this and the package looks nothing like in the picture! The plastic packaging is about 2""/8"" and rectangular in shape. Return it! It isn't satisfying at all and is only a piece of plastic with a bright light at the end. I hate that I can't return it! SO DISAPPOINTED."
2,Junk,"Although this sonic screwdriver looks pretty cool, it is a peice of junk. It can easily be broken. My 7 year old son played with it for two days and the button to turn on the light/make the sonic noise broke off. We have yet to find the little button. (Not good if you have small children) I do not recommend this toy."
4,Sonic Everything!,"This was my 18 year old's favorite birthday gift this year! She carries it around to ""sonic"" things randomly - phones, radios, door locks, etc. Only had it less than one month, so not sure how durable it will be. Would be great if it was metal instead of plastic, but then the price would probably increase, too. Great fun for Doctor Who fans!"
5,Allons-y!,"This product was very easy to assemble and it's even more fun to use! However, I had to superglue the pen nibs because they fell off easily. I reccommend this to any Doctor Who fan! It's fantastic!"
2,Cheap build,"My kid likes it, but for that price I expected something more substantial, better built. It's fragile and doesn't do much (gee, an LED lights up). It's lame."
4,Not bad at all but a bit pricey,"Unfortunately, I found this cheaper at FYE last week, but I had already bought it months ago. This is a great prop, in scale with a typical adult. I love the UV light on the end though I wish the pen end weren't removable simply because I'm afraid it will fall off one day and get lost."
5,Best gift for any Doctor Who fans!,"I bought this for my friend's birthday the other week and I knew how much she loves Doctor Who and thought this would be an excellent present! In fact, I was so excited about giving this to her and it got me into watching Doctor Who as well. To be honest I wanted to keep this for myself!It works perfectly and she has so much fun carrying it around and keeps making the sonic screwdriver make sounds just like the show.It's very simple to put together and the instructions were easy to read.The 'invisible' ink works perfectly and it's just so fun to carry around!A definite YES to any Doctor Who fans!"
3,No wallet? Burned out light?,"Right, so I just got this today after coming back home... Needless to say, I was excited, but when I opened the package and put the batteries in, my face fell. It was sonic all right, sounds and everything! But, for some reason, the light wasn't able to light up. I have sent a request to return it for a replacement, but hopefully this defect was only just in mine. Overall, the toy construction is good, the detail is nice, and I really like the sound of it. The pen was full of ink ready to use! It's a good toy, but it's unfortunate that my bulb was already burned out."
3,Very poor quality,This Sonic screwdriver comes with a removable pen nub and a replacement ultraviolet pen nub. the cap clips to the nub better than the nub clicks to the pen making it very difficult to take the cap off the pen. every time i touch it i feel like it is going to fall apart in my hands. very poor build quality and bad design of the pen nubs.
4,My daughter loves her sonic,A nice product that does nothing but buzz and glow but that is what it is - it seemed a bit cheaply made and one of the parts keeps popping off but she loves it anyway
4,Too fun!,"I just got a matching pair of sonic screwdrivers for me and my daughter. She is absolutely thrilled and has been using it to open every door in our house.I had planned to buy a Gen 11 for her and this one for me, but the reviews for the newer one were so disappointing that I went for a set. The construction seems pretty solid for toy-grade plastic. It seems durable enough if handled with some care. In our testing the UV pen nib seemed a little dry. That's not a major feature for me, so it's not that big a deal. I'll probably spend some time figuring out a way to refill it, though.Lights and sound effects are dead on, and from a short distance it looks more solid. If you're a fan of Doctor Who this is a great addition to your collection, or your wardrobe, or your toolbox... depending on your level of commitment. I think any fan would love to receive this as a gift."
4,Super fun!,"The sonic screw driver was awesome! The sounds and lights are wonderful. The pen for the secret messages is not child friendly and the cover for the screw that extended the driver out fell off quickly, but for our child he still loved it! Right up to the point that he lost it so we will be ordering a new one promptly!"
4,Very much a toy - but still wonderful,"Shipping was very quick for this item. When I received it, I was a little taken aback by how plastic and toy-like it looked. (I think, in my fannish excitement, I expected a real sonic screwdriver.) It's important to remember that this item reflects the price- it does not look super realistic. But upon opening it, all my worries melted away. It's a ridiculously fun prop for a Whovian to have. Very worth it."
3,Cheaply constructed for the price,"So, truthfully, I expected something at this price point to be a little sturdier. It's very cheap plastic, and the extendable part just slides in and out with gravity. My husband bought this for me for my grad school graduation. I didn't want to tell him, but I'm a little disappointed in the quality, frankly. Having said that, my 7-year-old loves it, and if I don't keep it hidden, he's off with it.This is a ten-dollar toy. If you find it for ten dollars, you are golden."
3,Beware the scews,i did not by this on amazon rather on ebay but the thing i must tell you is the screw where you put the battery strips easily like REALLY EASILY i suggest go to ace hardware or ghanal lumber and buy a new one becuse i canged my batteried today and i cant becuse...well you know. still i would buy this item. alonz-y. =)
4,"Great toy, wrong one though","I ordered the 10th Doctor Who's Sonic Screwdriver, however I was sent the 11th. I'm not let down because the 11th is my second choice. But when I contacted the seller on returns/exchange so I can gift the right screwdriver to a huge Doctor Who fan, I did not receive a reply and was forced to gift the wrong toy. I would have liked some sort of reply, but I was not."
4,Love it..,"This is one thing that I am very glad to have ordered. Although when I had opened the package the sonic 'head' (if you will..) had quite some small blemishes to it. Overall it's pretty good... shipped fast, and is as described. I have no complaints about it as of now. I honestly hope it stays that way. I have been told by my little brother that I'm annoying with all my ""Don't lose the pen piece..."" and now he tells me that when I just touch it. Pretty fun in the end.I only gave the durability 3 stars because I tend to be clumsy and drop this all the time... I have yet to find out if it's as durable as some say."
4,Doctor Who Fun,Not much to say about this toy. I enjoy it. The inivisible ink included with it is neat. I may use it for my costume at one of the sci fi conventions.
3,"Fun, but not for little ones","I love Doctor Who, and I love having toys at my desk. When I saw this sonic screwdriver, I had to have it! When it arrived, I wasn't overwhelmed, but I wasn't expecting an aluminum toy, really. The screwdriver noise seems somewhat off, but is still fun. The light lights up and is pretty cool. What is odd is that the other end is a pen and marker, but the pen nibs are very easy to remove and don't write very smoothly either. I was dissatisfied that they included a pen portion to the sonic screwdriver, it takes away from the durability of the toy."
2,don't drop it,the doctors sonic screwdriver was a very fun toy/collectible but the plastic is fragile and cant take more than two drops on the floor and the emitter tip Broke first drop the the second drop the wires to the wire and the sound chip riped and it no longer works but over all it was very fun
3,Cool item.. a little on the cheap side,This was a great gift to receive for the holidays.I've enjoyed sharing it with my 2 year old son. He quickly learned that it was to fix things. For those of you that care this is a great non-violent toy.The ultraviolet ink and light don't really work well together. But the pen side is good.It fits well in the hand and seems durable from the playing we've done with it. The mold seams aren't sanded off very well.It is about $20-$15 too expensive.But it is fun and I like imagining I am the doctor with it.Now if only I could get a nice TARDIS.
4,A 'must' for Whoians in the family,"A good gift for preteens and up. It's made of plastic so it may not last long for a young child that isn't so careful with toys. But functionally, it does what it says. Love the sound effects."
4,SONIC ALL THE THINGS!!!,"I did receive this item a little late, but that was due to weather, so the seller is not at fault for that.Overall this thing is pretty sweet, a little light and plastic-y?, but sweet. the UV ink and light are awesome.If you are a Who fan and don't want to spend an outrageous amount on a really high end one, this is for you or that person you know."
3,not much for the price,"At least this one makes sounds, too bad you can barely hear them!! My teen wasn't too impressed with this one either, nor I, @ $20 + shipping!! Plastic, lightweight flashlight (blacklight).... China, God love em', kinda done buying their products!"
3,Good halloween costume prop,"Not gonna lie, this toy is plastic and feels cheap and will probably break easily...but it makes the sound and has a black light, so that makes it pretty cool as a halloween costume prop!"
3,Fun for about 10 minutes,"It looks like metal in the picture, but it's really plastic. It has batteries, it's easy to assemble. The light goes on, the light goes off. The pen writes. It's one of those things you open up and say, ""Cool, the tenth doctor's sonic screwdriver!"" and ten minutes later, you're done with it, and it's a souvenir. But it's durable, I'll give it that."
5,Great Gift for the Geekily Inclined!,"I bought this toy for a friend who I introduced to Dr. Who and is now obsessed. She absolutely flipped out when she opened the bag and saw this toy! Shes had it for over a month now and as far as I can tell it is still in perfect working order. I did notice that the ink nibs that fit into the hilt of the toy do not fit as tightly as I would like them to, but they arent loose enough to prevent using the pen feature if you are careful. The UV ink is a novel idea but what really stood out about this particular toy was the fact that the head extends just like it does on the show, and the cheaper versions of this toy that amazon has available do not have this cool feature. The best thing about this toy is the first reaction of the reciever! Get ready for screams of joy and hours of role playing as everybodies favorite time traveller."
4,A Great Timey-Wimey Thing.,"Without a doubt, the portrayal of David Tennant as the tenth incarnation of the time travelling Time Lord has been one of the most popular of the new series....and what fan of the Doctor wouldn't be caught without a replica of his sonic screwdriver...in lieu of the actual article, of course.First off, it looks great. The packaging...well, not so much. It was quite a effort to cut into it and get all the tiny bits (batteries, extra ink nub, etc) out...An awesome replica. A bit on the light side, but that was unavoidable. Lights and sound are a bit touchy as well, but with some practice, you'll be up to Time Lord standards in no time.A warning...it feels a bit fragile, but it's tougher than it looks. It sits on my stereo speaker next to the Tenth Doctor's Flight Control Tardis and really sets it off. A definate must-have for Tennant fans."
2,Sonic screwdriver not a toy for kids,"I got this sonic screw driver to add to my Doctor Who collection. For that purpose it was ok. As a toy for a child, it is a piece of junk. It is very cheaply made, the bottoms only work if you fiddle with them. A toy made of solid plastic and operated by imagination would have been much better. It really is cheaply made and would only last five minutes if played with."
3,"It's good, but it could be better....","I really liked this sonic screwdriver replica. The only aspects I was disappointed in were that it only operates at 2 heights: all the way down and all the way up, and that the sound was only at one pitch. I think if they made it so the pitch went gradually higher as you slid the extention up, then it would be a lot more fun and realistic. Otherwise, I really liked the toy. It's very Doctor Who. I would give it a 3 1/2 star review for fun if I could. I don't think it deserves to be shunted down to a 3, but I also don't think it makes the cut to be bumped up to a 4. I would recommend purchasing it though. Especially if you have kids that are into Doctor Who. I think they would enjoy it despite it's degrading qualities. Although it does mysteriously seem to get people irritated when you use it all the time.... Overall, I think it's a good purchase to make, for yourself or for someone else."
5,Fantastic!,"I ordered this sonic screwdriver to accompany a Rose Tyler Halloween costume on a Saturday evening, and got the package on a Wednesday morning -- excellent shipping! I'm very pleased with the product, too. It is made of plastic, as many reviewers before me have said, but I haven't had any of the breaking problems that others seems to have found. For the most part, my screwdriver has seemed very durable, and I cannot complain about either the UV light or the sounds. The ink pen works great, too! This will be a great addition to my costume this Halloween."
4,I love it but..,"I was so happy when I got it and so far everything has worked great but the UV ink :(. I spent a lot of money on this for being an amazing toy and one of the neat bonus features being the UV reactive ink. I've been trying to get the pen to work, dipping it in warm tap water like it says and nothing, I need a replacement and being in America trying to get the replacement from the UK is time and cost expensive. I love everything else just really wish my UV ink would work!"
4,"Camparison with ""The Eleventh""","Got this for one of my daughters and she does like it. However, my other daughter then bought the eleventh model and one advantage of that is it makes a lot louder noise. The noise of the tenth is very low. The tenth has the writing aspect but that tends not to be used after being impressed when trying for the first time. I am thinking of getting a real one:[...]Shipping for both was amazing. The eleventh came from the UK, which added to the excitement. Ditto for the Dr Who lunch box."
4,Heartbreaking,"When I first saw this product, I thought I'd finally be able to meet the Doctor... he'd arrive at my place, give me his sonic screwdriver and take me to his TARDIS to fight aliens whilst learning how to use it (all the settings, the functions, etc.) but its jut a toy. Plastic with an extendable tip. Cool toy... toys are cool, but just a toy."
4,I like it,bought it for halloween as i went as the 10th doctor. Everyone loved the screw driver and i have a lot of fun messing with it as I watch Doctor Who. the little cover to the slide falls off easy but its not a big deal as the base is till there it just exposes the screw.
5,Hours of fun!,I bought this for my daughter as I have made her a huge Dr. Who fan... She hasn't got to play with it yet. But I love it. I sonic everything.
2,Disappointed...,"I bought this Dr. Who toy for my 15-year-old's birthday, and after reading the product description and other reviews I was expecting this toy to be much nicer. My first impression was, ""this thing really looks more plasticky than I was expecting."" The light and the noise work my as expected, but it feels cheap and poorly made. When you extend the screwdriver the cap on the back often falls off and the whole thing feels a bit like it might fall apart. This feels like a $5 toy to me, it was definitely not worth over $30. My son was very excited about the gift when he saw it, and quickly went through the first battery, but overall I'd still say his impression was ""disappointed"" as well."
2,"Works, but not really well made.","The extending action is interesting, and the sound and light are accurate and fun. The size is accurate as well, but I'm a little disappointed with the quality. I like the fact that it doubles as a pen, but the pen nob falls off easily - more easily than the pen cap. The plastic construction looks a bit cheap. For the price I was expecting a bit more quality."
3,"Flimsy, but fun","Overall, it has a cheap feel to it. But alas, it was cheap. I wish they used a AAA battery instead of AG13 as well. It's just a fun toy to sit around watching the Doctor with."
3,Fun to pretend,"My 16 year old daughter thought this toy was fun to pretend and joke around with, however, it is not educational, and pieces keep breaking off. Defiantly not worth the money paid."
1,$30 pen,"I had hoped that for $30+ this item would be anything but cheap. It is an extruded plastic toy. The pen tips are approximately 3 cm long. You cannot utilize the toy for writing even as a novelty. Any pressure applied while writing makes the pen tip fall out. The cover piece of plastic falls off when actuating the slide. The toy does make the ""sonic screwdriver"" sound. The light is a near UV led.I need to say here that I did not expect a prop replica here but a partly metallic item for this money is not unrealistic."
5,Sonic Screwdriver!!!! Go Doctor GO!,"I loved this toy so much even though I bought it as a gift, I didn't really want to give it away. So I bought a second one for myself. :) Now I take it where ever I go and use it when doors are locked. ;) You should definitely get this item if you want to be a cool kid."
5,Doctor Who Fans <3,This product is amazing. I love it so much. I'm a huge Doctor Who fan and nerdfighter so this is fantastic. David Tennant FTW. The only bad thing is that it has a super tiny easy to lose piece to cover the screw. It's really nice over all. The screw is so small though. You'll need a super small screwdriver. Hehe a screwdriver for your screwdriver so you can use your screwdriver while you screwdrive. Hehehe
2,Meh.,"I ordered this for my boyfriend last year for Christmas, and was a bit disappointed with the result. The screwdriver is NOT realistic; it's plastic and very dull. The sound worked and was pretty fun, until it broke after about a month from use. Basically if you are expecting an exact sonic screwdriver replica, then don't go for this. It's really fun to play with though! Probably best for a child."
4,A fun toy for a costume party,The build quality is good and the lights and sounds are enjoyable - it was fun to take to the costume party.
3,"Not quite what I expected, but still cool","I didn't expect it to be entirely made of plastic, and thought that for the price that at least SOME of it would be metal or a durable material, but it wasn't. Also, the UV pen nibs were dried out upon arrival, which was also a pretty big downer. It was a little disappointing, but my girlfriend still loved it, so I'm happy."
3,"Looks nice, but very cheaply made","Not at all unexpected for the price, but this is definitely a toy and not a replica item. The slide piece is pretty loose, and the pen attachment is constantly falling out. Did work great for my Halloween costume, got lots of smiles from the whovians."
2,Pictures so much better than product,Unimpressive flimsy plastic casing and doesn't work for very long. Too bad because the pictures were so cool. Very lame.
4,So much fun!,"This is any Whovian's dream come true! Like many of the other reviews say, you need to be careful with the nibs because they are REALLY easy to lose. However, the blue light and sonic sounds are spot on. I also bought the 11th Doctors Screwdriver for my friend, and I'd say that this one is far less sturdy. Nonetheless, it's great (:"
1,poor quality,This toy fell apart within minutes of opening the box. Made of cheap plastic. It looked great but don't be fooled. I do not reccomed buying!
4,"cheap, yet satisfying",The product looks cheap and its completely made of plastic but its from doctor who. Who wouldn't love it!? :D
2,sonic? should be sson-sick,"Arrived properly packaged with no damage. Batteries included. Laser light doesn't work as a pointer, just illuminates the blue end cap and that is dim. The sonic sound is just a beep each time you push the button. After three weeks the push button has failed. You must wiggle it side to side to make it work. Batteries were checked and found to be fully charged at 1.5 vdc each. I've had christmas cards that sing louder. As a show piece that sits on the shelf... it doesn't measure up either. The plastic case has stamped impressions that would need to be (painted) detailed to allow it to be properly displayed. The secret writing ink did work and the blue light did allow the ink to be visible. A fun fact for the kids, but that didn't last long. I won't waste money on trying the 11th Doctor's sonic screwdriver."
2,Not worth your time,"I bought this after I had already purchased the 11th Doctor's Sonic Screelwdriver. This was is substantially lacking in quality construction. There is a plastic piece used to slide the screwdriver into an extended position, that will fall off without much force at all. The whole of the toy isn't even good plastic. I recommend this as a child's toy who is not yet a Whovian. When a prop quality version is mass produced I'll be certain to mention it here."
3,Cute,"The sounds are somewhat realistic, but the plastic on the slider and buttons is VERY cheap feeling."
5,Doctor Who - The Tenth Doctor's Sonic Screwdriver Review,I really like this product. It is very clever on how they make it able to slide up and down.
5,David Tennat's Sonic Screwdriver!,I think this item is best for people who are fans of doctor who or people who are obsessive about it.It love it and draw a lot with its pen attachments. My family enjoys it to but they probable sometimes get annoyed.It is the same size as the one in the show. It is plastic and lights up. Like David Tennat's it gets longer with a slide.I enjoy that it is the same size as in the show. It has a uv ink with light and normal pen. It gets longer.I only wish it was a little smaller for my small hands.
3,Cheaper than I was expecting,"The head really has to be forced to move and the construction of the body is a cheap plastic. The design is fine, but the material is cheap.The UV writing is pretty cool, though."
4,fun toy,"great toy for whovians, just wish it was metal instead of plastic... nothing has broken & whole family jealous of me when I got it, so it is a good gift for Dr. Who fans."
5,Toy for Adults,"This thing is great for what it is- a toy for adults. It's not a super accurate prop replica, and I don't think it would hold up against being played with by a young child. But, if you want a neat little toy from the show to have sitting in your office, it's for you. I imagine it would also make a good costume accessory to go with a Dr. Who Halloween get up, especially with the light and sound."
4,sonic screwdriver,"same size as shown on tv. has two sounds if u press the button twice.only let down is its made from plastic, be careful with children, as black plastic end is a little sharp...id recommend it for children over the age of 9"
1,very cheaply made,"we are big Dr. Who fans, and wanted to get the sonic screwdrivers of the last 3 doctors, BUT.... when we went to order the 10th doctors screw driver this is the only one we found. a toy. and a toy is just that! it is very cheaply made and it looks it too! we also ordered the 11th doctors screwdriver (the replica) that was very well made, and next to it, this one looks rediculous! would return it, but that is a pain, so it stays in the drawer instead of on the shelf with the other dr. who stuff. if you have a child that wants a toy, this would be the item for them, but if you are a collector of dr. who things, I wouldnt get this....... its a shame they didnt make a replica of this one like they did for the 11th doctor....."
3,It's Ok,"It's a toy for the imagination as it virtually does nothing but lights up and makes sounds.I suppose a child would enjoy it.Simple lights and sounds seem to fascinate them.Trying to write with this thing will take some time getting use to, because it is so big and fat.Why are there pen nibs any way?I don't ever see Dr whO using his sonic screwdriver to write with.A couple of things to note, It is bigger once you actually get it in your hands than it looks in the advertisements.BEWARE! You will not get the item in the discription.The description reads that the sonic Screwdriver is part of a package that includes a wallet with physic paper.It does not,People who buy this after reading the description will be dissappointed when they realise the discription is for another product that went out of production a year ago.And all you are going to get is just whats picture A lone sonic screwdriver.Even after numerous reviews citing this error the discription remains the same."
5,"I've created a ""Dr.""","I got this for my husband as a gag gift for his birthday - he loves Dr. Who. Now he runs about the house sonic-ing the door locks, the computer, the microwave, even the dogs. The dogs don't like it much, but he sure does."
3,Not as pictured,"Although it is in fact the doctors screwdriver, its missing the wallet.""Includes wallet with ""Wipe-Clean"" paper. UV ink nib and black ink nib""not included at all.Also, my ""invisible"" ink was dry upon arrival.Otherwise, it does have the look and feel of the 10th doctors sonic screwdriver."
4,Molto Bene!,"My wife, knowing what a gigantic nerd she married, chose this as a fantastic addition to the anniversary gifts we exchanged this year. I love it! I'm a huge fan of the show, and having my very own sonic screwdriver in my interior jacket pocket is such a treat. The interchangable nibs on the end are a bit difficult to open and easily lost, so I wouldn't recommend this as a durable toy in the hands of a child. But a man-child? Absolutely. The sounds are dead on, as is the overall look, although it's easy to be fooled by the pictures - this is definitely a toy with a plastic-y lightness that probably wouldn't survive a drop to hard flooring. In every other respect, it's a blast to goof around with, and I'd recommend it to any die-hard fans."
5,What a great Sonic!,I love my sonic screwdriver so much! It's great for costume parties and Doctor Who meet ups.One problem: It doesn't do wood.
2,"one worked, one didn't","Would have returned the one that didn't work, but didn't keep receipt. my girls were so excited to each get one. One I bought from a local record store, and it worked, the one I bought online, no sound. SONIC screwdriver, yeah, sound is important! My daughter was so bummed out."
4,From Abingdon Press:,"This book contains representative writings of early American Methodists illustrating their spirituality and lives. It presents primary source material from the writings of early American Methodists (ca. 1770-1820). The author topically organizes and sets each reading in context. Materials from Francis Asbury, Thomas Coke, Peter Cartwright, as well as rank-and-file Methodists are included. This book demonstrates that early Methodism was made up of both men and women and both Black and White persons. The primary material includes sermon outlines, journal and diary entries, excerpts from correspondence, hymnody and poetry, theological reflections, and contemporaneous historical descriptions."
5,Heroic Trio,I love to collect these type of movies and a big fan of Michelle Yeoh. I love the movie and had no complaints about the DVD. The DVD was in excellent shape. I receive the DVD as quickly as possible after I ordered it. Great customer service. I am willing to buy from this seller again. Thanks!
4,Love Sci-fi Kung Fu,"I had seen this movie on HBO at 3AM when i was 13... I've been looking for it ever since!now, 10yrs later, i finally find it and am able to get it!One of my many fave Michelle Yeoh flicks!Now, I just need to get the second one ... in english (can only find the original Chinese version)!Good story! Love the action (considering when it was made), and i love the 3 actresses in this movie- they were in a lot of other action and action-comedy movies.Actually, I think each actress has been in at least one movie with Jackie Chan!!Classic! Great buy!"
3,"WORTH WATCHING, BUT NOT FANTASTIC","Its not a bad kung fu movie, but its sequel, EXECUTIONERS, is better. TRIO has all the normal kung fu plot, comic book goofiness, and it has some decent preformances and entertaining fight sequences. Its nice to see the three actresses together, and thier characters suit them well. It has its moments where it drags, but not enough to hinder it too much. I would have given it a higher review if EXECUTIONERS hadnt been just a little smoother than TRIO. Still, they are both fine kung fu fantasies."
3,Heoric Three,Not yet sure if I like this movie or not. It is in Chinese with english subtitles so you miss a lot of the action just trying to read the lines. I can either read the lines and miss the action going on or watch the action and not know what they are saying. I wish all movies in the US would be in English.
1,Dubbed again!,"I love this movie, and it has three wonderful actresses in it who are superstars in Hong Kong film and in their own right, but this version, without mentioning it anywhere in the Amazon description, is entirely dubbed in the old dopey fashion. I can understand why a dubbed version would be sold, but why not have the original language (Mandarin, or Cantonese) as well? I cannot address whether or not this version is also cut, as some versions have been in the past, but the running time is 86 minutes. Perhaps Miramax/Echo Bridge should change their slogan to ""The entertainment alternative for those"" who don't mind us determining what they want to see. This review applies only to the recent DVD release which is said to be by ""Echobridge"" on Amazon -- the DVD has a copyright of 2011. Don't bother unless you haven't seen it and want an English language version only. If you do, I would rate the movie four stars."
5,Completely over the top Hong Kong Sci-Fantasy Kung-Fu Police Drama,"Dodgy sets, iffy acting, crazy stunts, bizarre characters, and a plot stretched to the breaking point and well beyond. What's not to love? It's supremely strange, deliciously silly, and utterly irrepressible. There are a couple of DVD releases, frankly with this sort of source material, find one that's inexpensive and don't worry about the transfer quality or the soundtrack."
3,comic book strikes again,Some fairly good martial arts action does not excuse a nonsensical plot and frivolous acting.
4,these ain't no angels,"The Heroic Trio is your typical over-the-top Hong Kong action flick, with outrageous stunts and action that will have you choking on your popcorn in astonishment (I guarantee you will never forget the decapitation cage or the motorcycle flying sideways through the air-- among other things). Though it has been compared to Charlie's Angels, this is much more a comic book fantasy, and if you accept it on the level of Batman or Spiderman, then you'll do just fine. My only complaint is that the women have an amazing ability to recover from their injuries. And the last line is a hoot; after accessorizing their outfits with capes, the one says, ""The press are coming; we have to look good."" (!!) If only more of the dialogue was that goofy. Still, after one viewing you'll be saying Lucy, Cameron, and Drew Who?"
2,One of the funniest movies I've seen,"I first sat down to watch this film as the late, late movie one night. It was such a bad film that I was cracking up the whole time. I love any film that makes me laugh. It's one of my favorites. From the lines that jumped straight from comic books to the wires holding people in the air, The Herioc Trio had me laughing all the way. I really enjoyed it."
2,The Heroic Trio,The bad editing turned me off to this movie. I didn't need to see the wires to know that they were using them. Thru the whole movie I spotted items that should have been edited out.
2,Disrespect of foreign films continues.,"Disney continues to butcher the work of foreign directors. THey bought the rights to most of the famous Asian action films, prohibit the sale of the original version, and then release a version on dvd without the original soundtrack, scenes cut, titles changed, etc. For a company that attempts to market it's own movies worldwide, it shows a total disrespect for the art of other countries. This movies is entertaining, but I would seek out a copy of the Tai Seng company version. It includes english subtitles. Anyone realize how easy it is to add a second audio track,not to mention widescreen and fullscreen on the same disc. Disney continues to refuse this. Don't get me wrong, I buy all of there major animated release, and they can show great care and respect for their own work, I just wish they'd cater to the collector as well as the Kmart crowd."
5,Please note!,"For those of you thinking of purchasing this DVD, please note that the dialogue is dubbed in English completely. For those of you who prefer it in its original language (Cantonese), give this a miss.Otherwise the movie is great and the acting superb, plus we get to see the late Anita Mui in action. What can you say... top notch performance from Michelle Yeoh, Maggie Cheung and Anita Mui."
3,MICHELLE YEOH IN A SPANDEX,"That's all I needed to see to make this a classic movie. Some very good fight scenes, but you have to be pretty hard-core into these movies to really like this. Also some very weird fight scenes. The final fight I have never made it through to the end, not cause it was too sick, just because I did't like it. But I did like the whole movie up to that point. It is great to see Iron robe yim from OUATIC playing a REAL baddie.The dubbing is a different story, this would have easily get a 4/5 if I could get my hands on the original language version. Seriously, this movie is like 86 minutes long, that is just a horribly done dvd, they remaster the picture to perfection, but can't give any type of other feature on this, how freaking hard is it to pu the original language on these."
1,Poor quality,"I ordered two frames, one of which came with the glass broken--and which Amazon promptly replaced. The finish on both frames is chipped at the corners, the backing on one frame is wrinkled, and the hangers are pieces of cardboard that are carelessly stapled to the frame. Junk!"
3,color is uglier when you see it,"Yes these frames do look cheaper when you see it than it does in the picture. The color was ""off"" somehow to me. And I didn't like that is did not come ready to hang for the price. But I could not find this size anywhere in stores so it had to do!"
1,Looks larger in the picture than actual size,The spatula and tong portion of this product is very small. Too small to flip a hamburger. It would be ok to use with french fries.
5,The best book for the networking newbie or guru,"Encyclopedia of Networking, Electronic Edition, contains nearly everything a newbie or guru would ever need to know about networking. The writing is extremely clear and really hits the mark in terms of not dumbing down the topics. Be sure to get the Electronic Edition which includes the entire book on a CD-ROM (it's less embarrassing to look something up on the CD than a five-pound book when you get a sticky question, not to mention that it's easier to carry around)."
1,Good News / Bad News,"BAD NEWS: I read the 3 existing reviews before I bought this book. I purchased it to use for my networking classes as a resource for writing papers and doing study notes by cutting and pasting from the CD Rom. It did not work. The help section gave implicit instructions on how to do this and referred you to windows help on cut and paste if there explanation was not sufficient. It still did not work, and therefore was of no value to me. (The content IS good, the function was the bad news).GOOD NEWS: These people are TERRIFIC. Without a hassle, they heard my story; are refunding ALL my money including shipping; sending me a label to return the book AND suggested I write this review!I buy quite a few books and Music from these folks. I wish I had purchased their stock way back when (along with many other people). They deserve my business; and I am ordering 2 more networking related books this date. No wonder they are successful. GO AMAZON!"
2,lazy day read,"The Provincial Lady series are enjoyable easy reads for a day in the sun or just lazing in on sunday. or best before bedtime. Best of the lot is the first one ""diary of a provincial lady"" the rest just follow the same vein so it gets a bit too familiar."
5,Koko Can Sing The Blues,Koko Taylor lets out all of her power onto this cd. She really shows that she puts effort into the blues. Buy this CD and I mean it. She is the only woman I have ever heard make such growls and have such energy. Koko Taylor is The Quen and get it straight. Buy this Cd and I know you will not be dissapointed.
1,Let's get retarded in here!,"Chris Burke is the actor with Down's Syndrome who was on the TV showLife Goes On. This is his album for children. I say that it's ""his"" album, but most of the singing on the album is done by Joe & John DeMasi. In fact, Chris can't sing at all. I don't mean that he sings badly, I mean that he doesn't actually sing. The few lyrics that Chris is actually allowed to perform are spoken by him, not sung. The album mostly consists of bad original songs, but there are also bad cover versions of The Beatles ""Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da"", The Coasters ""Poison Ivy"" and Nat ""King"" Cole's ""Nature Boy"". This is a terrible children's album, which I am sure that children will not enjoy. Here is the track listing:1. Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da2. Love Makes the World Go Round3. You're a Star4. Poison Ivy5. Rising in Love6. My Imagination7. Nature Boy8. Everybody in the Pool9. Eating is Fun, Eating is Serious10. Forever Girl11. Nobody's Chasin' Nobody12. All Walk Together"
2,CORKY???,"I honestly dont know why someone would buy this junk. Its a cd by the guy from Life Goes On. If your into bad music, by all means go ahead."
4,Let the Doctor take you to school,"A New Orleans musical history lesson that doesn't feel or sound like school at all. Actually, it sounds like a party in Dr. John's living room. Spirited piano and vocals in his inimitable style, and freewheeling arrangements of a number of Deep South R n' B standards - guaranteed fresh, hot, and steaming every time you stick it in the player. Plus, highly informative liner notes on each and every song by the good doctor."
2,"OK, but not GREAT (no matter what these guys say)","While Gumbo is in fact a nicely produced and carefully assembled set of Nawlins hits and classics performed with gusto by a GREAT crew, this album is in NO WAY shape or form comparable to Gris-Gris, which is not only a masterpiece of psychedelic blues funk voodoo magic charm, but a CLASSIC piece of music when stacked up against anything from ANYWHERE in ANY GENRE!! Get it? That means Gris-Gris IS New Orleans, not just of it or from it or about it, but the ACTUAL thing itself. You don't need to jump on a plane to get there when you hear that record, 'cause you already ARE there. I guess they could use the money and attention though, so get on that plane if you have the ticket already..."
5,tres bon Dr. John,I read one of the other reviews saying this album was not as good as...well this album is as good as it gets. I liked it.
5,Inspiration to be unique,"This marvelous book can inspire children (and the adults who read to them) to celebrate their uniqueness, and how doing so can bring freedom and joy to others!Has it affected my life? Well, this summer we are having striped vinyl siding put on our home..."
4,Not exactly the Anarchist's Handbook,"This pre-school guide to independent thinking has been a family favorite for decades. Lessons for the young, and for those unwilling to grow up. Our original copy was bought 'pre-tattered' at a garage sale in the 70's. I've just purchased 3 new ones as stocking stuffers for my adult children."
5,The Best of Pinkwater,"This was the first Pinkwater book I encountered. In fact, it was the only Pinkwater book I had as a child. I loved it then, I love it now. I've read and enjoyed many other Pinkwater books as an adult, but this one is still my favorite because of its sheer nonsense in the pursuit of happiness. I am overcome with giddy joy every time I read The Big Orange Splot."
4,Wonderful Book - but the splot isn't orange!,"My 3.5 yr old (whose favorite color is orange) got this as a Christmas gift. We all love this book! Both the story and the illustrations keep his attention, and the lesson is a very important one. I would love to give this book 5 stars, BUT the splot isn't orange! Maybe it's just our printing, but the splot in our book is red. My son insists that I read the book as ""The Big Red Splot."" We still love the book, and I would recommend it, although you may find yourself substituting red for orange as you read it to your little one."
4,Great book about being yourself,"It's easy to say this book is about non-conformity, but it's not, exactly. Our hero doesn't let the splot stay, doesn't paint his house to be a jungle, doesn't put up palm trees and sit outside drinking lemonade to be different. He does it to be himself.It's a more subtle message, and one worth sharing with any loved child."
1,Horrible !!,Not at all attractive......very disappointed.....2 different shades of white that dont look right. A waste of money.
1,Not a study guide,"This book contains only questions with short explanations for the answers. While this might work well as a second book, it can't serve as the core study guide for the i-Net+ exam. In looking over the book's description, I still can't find anything to indicate that this is the case, so be warned. The book also doesn't include a CD, which I usually find to be extremely useful."
3,Not for the beginner,"If you are looking for a starter course on Meditation this is not the book for you. If you already have a serious Buddhist background and have read many of the texts that are referenced this is for you.I have read quite a lot of Eastern Religion texts and had practiced years ago, wanting to get back into this I ordered this book and i am having to go back to other texts to read up on some of the ideas & practices that are referenced. I am not saying that The Dali Lama does not do a great job at explaining, but his Stages of Meditation is a manual for a Practice of Devotion that will take your life. To read it to try to get back into basic practices and meditate, quiet the mind this is not the book for you. I have not been able to get through reading it completely yet as I am having to reference many other things and it is so in depth on how to try to attain living the life of a Bodhisattva that it misses the mark for one who is not a lifelong Buddhist scholar."
5,Who cannot like the Dalai Lama?,"I am not myself much into intellecturalizing about Buddhist practice. But nevertheless, there is something helpful and healing in reading the Dalai Lama's books. In this book, as in the others, I found a few new ways to seeing things that I have been able to apply in my own practice. It is somehow good to be in touch with this good man."
4,Why to mediate?,Focused on the daily practice of meditation this book offers a concise vision on what would be a step by step achieved progress of our mind development towards our personal enlightenment (within the Tibetan Buddhism frame); the book is clear and written in a language accessible to everyone.
4,Stylish. Almost perfect.,"This is an extremely nice, substantial timepiece from Fendi that has a cool, manly, modernist vibe to it. The case has clean, machine-like lines and a sort of industrial aesthetic that contrasts nicely with the black leather alligator-esque strap that makes it appropriate for formal wear. Displays the 2, 4, 8, 10 and 12, with a small 60-second-hand-sweep dial located at the 6 o'clock position. The date is displayed in two small windows directly beneath the 12, with each digit getting its own window - not the most elegant date display, but unique nonetheless. Since this is a non-perpetual calendar, you have to set it manually at the beginning of each month or else it will keep counting in sequence all the way up to the ""39th"" of the month. This can be a bit of a hassle, but is the only substantial drawback to the watch (for anyone who is bothered by such things). Otherwise it's a definite winner."
5,Loved it,"I love the poetry in this book... folksy, funny and real. The poems have a down-to-earth spirituality that comes from a love of life and the great outdoors. I got one for myself, but ended up getting a couple more for gifts. A very good buy."
3,Great mulch maker if you baby it,"My hubby bought me this so I could mulch all the leaves, branches and faded perennials from my gardens. It does a good job with dry garden waste such as leaves, stems, or branches. However I have to feed it very slowly when I try to mulch anything that is stringy like daylily leaves, irises or grasses. These stringy items clog the motor FAST especially if they are wet. And stringy things tend to go through the chipper in one piece, thus defeating the purpose. The leaves and branches come out sufficiently mulched to decompose into a nice compost. But you can't fill the chute with leaves or it gets clogged so I basically feed it a handful at a time. Definitely wear eye and ear protection with this machine. A fine homeowner tool that beats having to rent one."
2,Not very usable.,"For a web usability book, this one is suprisingly unusable. The book is overdesigned, making it sometimes hard to read because of all the visual clutter on the page. It's also over-wordy. If only the author had taken Steve Krug's advice (which he mis-quotes in the first chapter) to cut out half the words, and then cut out half of what's left, this might have been a great book. As it is, its only contributions are from the design standpoint, such as not breaking the model of the web, and not making the navigation so contrast-y as to visually distract from the content. Otherwise, just about everything he says is said more succinctly in Krug's book, ""Don't Make Me Think."""
1,Usability - Physician Heal Thyself,"To be fair about this, I am not judging the content of the book, but the format of the book is horrific. The author presents concepts for implementing usable web design through a book that seems to ignor hundreds of years of proven usability principles for the printed word. Interesting design, or even attractive design, is not always usable design.The book looks like an undergraduate graphic design project - and not a successful one at that. While the author may have many good things to say, communication of those points gets lost in the design. His credibility for what he has to say also gets lost, because of the way he presents his information. I purchased this book for about $6 (used), that's a fair price for an example of what not to do. If you want to gain a solid understanding of basic usability principles, start with Steve Krug's ""Don't Make Me Think""."
2,Broken zippers and some frayed stiching are problematic,"I used to play out a lot...not so much any more but it is frustrating to load up and have compartments that wont zip closed. The bag itself is made of sturdy material, but once the zipper jumps its track there is no way to get it back in line. The zippers are not metal which is surprising for what I expected would be a tough long lasting bag. The side pocket sipper is totally shot. The circle pocket on the other side has frayed stiching around the zipper and will fail in the near future.I have had this for several years, but I take care of my stuff. I am currently looking for a replacement and this one came up in my search. This is not one I will get again. This is supposed to be upscale, and isn't cheap. Zildjan are the best cymbals in the world by far, but they should be more careful what they put their names on...."
3,not my cup of tea (or whiskey).,Readers of literary biographies will likely find more of interest in this book than I did. I am not qualified to comment on the author's analysis of Hemingway as a literary figure. The author of the book did not strike me as being qualified to delve deeply into the motivations of Hemingway as hunter. As a hunter myself and an avid reader of safari books penned during the colonial era in Africa I found this book to be a disappointment. If your interest is African safaris or hunting in general I would pass on this title. If your interest is in Hemingway as a person and particularly as a writer then you may appreciate the book. One minor point: I found the glossy pages of my hardcover edition to be a trial to read due to the glare. Better to have put only the photos on glossy pages.
2,Just ok!,"I have used this earpiece for a while now and it does work well indoors, but when outside and there is any wind both myself and the person I am talking to can really hear the wind noise. When I am driving my Ford diesel truck people on the other end say the background noise is so bad I should just stop using the bluetooth and go back to the handset. I paid full price for this a couple of years ago and hate having to throw it a side and get another one but I am shopping for another one that has better noise cancelling."
4,A moving look into the mind of an amazing writer.,This book provides a curious look into the life of the Colorado river before the Glen Canyon Dam. It is a collection of stories of life (and sometimes death). It is a good read
5,Down the River,"This book actually has special meaning to me. In the late 70's I attended a ""reading"" of yet to be published essays by Edward Abbey in Boulder Colorado. I recall he was in town lending support to protestors against Rocky Flats Nuclear Arsenal. Years later rummaging through a used book store I found Down the River containing those essays. I should have taken the other road...Cheer,George"
5,"A paradise lost, and a civilization headed in the same direction","Abbeys prose are strong, harsh, and often humorous. The title story portrays an early journey down the Colorado river through a splendid canyon that has since been buried by Lake Powell. It is a great adventure, but the story goes far beyond the whitewater and beautiful scenery. The brilliant style portrays a deep love of the natural world and a horror for what is happening to it in the name of greed and stupidity. Dancing on the Edge of an Endangered Planet"
4,Works as expected,"The pull up bar works very well. It's a bit tricky to install as the two brackets need to be at the exact same height off the ground for the bar to be straight, but if you take your time and use a tape measure, you'll be fine. My friends and I have been using it every day for weeks and it shows no signs of wearing. The grips can be moved with minimal trouble if you turn them while pulling."
4,Really good gaming keyboard,"This is a nice keyboard.For gaming it has just about anything you would need for FPSs to MMOs.The only downside of this keyboard is that it has no number pad or media controls and the warrior pad end of it doesn't have the function keys like the original warrior gaming keyboard.This can be used as the sole keyboard for a computer but I suggest having another standard keyboard for mundane things and using this only for text entry and gaming.Also this keyboard seems more well built then the warrior key pads and is far more versatile. So, skip the warrior pad and get this instead. Because other than those two little things this is great keyboard."
5,great gaming keyboard,"just want to say that it only took me a few days to get used to the timberwolf gaming keyboard...The more i use it, the better i like it!"
1,A Terrible Edition of a Wonderful Book,"This is an important and worthwhile study, and relatively unsung. I recommend reading the book, but you'd be making a big mistake if you tried to read it in this edition. I'm not sure how the book was printed, but it looks like a photoreproduction, and a sketchy one at that, of an old, tiny, and all-but-unreadable typeface. The publishing information indicates that it is an edition from India in the 1940s, and I'd guess that the original typesetting was pretty old by the time this printing was produced. In short, it looks like a photocopy of a worn-out setting of bad type. Some pages are illegible. A few others, near the beginning, are actually missing. Caudwell was a promising author before his early, tragic death, and he deserves better than this. So do you."
1,"not worth reading,much less buying","I was very disappointed in this book. I wouldn't have bought it if I had known that it was by two writers from the Economist. Sadly, they seem to share the typical Economist slants, and have no idea about what Conservatism is all about in America. They probably spend all their time in Washington DC and New York and think they have experienced America. I consider the book to be one long editorial, long on uninformed opinion and short on facts. The one thing this book won't do is lead readers to any understanding of the Right Nation."
5,Well Balanced Account,"Mr. Wooldridge and Mr. Micklethwait present us with a balanced, well researched and fascinating account of conservatism in America. They look at the roots of the conservative movement and how it has built strength in recent years. Both gentlemen write for the Ecconomist so they take a European perspective in their observation of our political and ecconomic systems. The writing suberb. Whether you are Republican or Democrat, conservative or liberal, this is AN IMPORTANT BOOK!!"
3,different but not like I would like,"the cd is very arabic, but its to many techno with the arabic instruments. its a cd more to dance to listen quiet. i guess that its not bad, but the cd itsn't the perfect music to listen when i want rest or creat an ambient exotic, its so jumping."
4,Laser Could be Better,"I bought this level with great enthusiasm. It had three laser levels on it that would greatly assist in many tasks. I was disappointed when I finally received the level and wanted to use it. After placing the level on a level surface I needed to mark, up the wall, several locations for holes that would be perpendicular to the surface I was leveling. I thought the level would show a laser line going up the wall that I could use as a guide. Instead, all it did was project a red dot onto the ceiling. This reduced the usefulness of the lasers, for what I had intended it for.Short of this little drawback, the level is excellent. It's well made and I get a great deal of use from it."
2,Movie is Great DVD is Disapointing,"I love this movie. Being a Mr. Mom myself with 2 boys ""and a Job"" I relate to this movie very much. But I am dissapointed in the fact that MGM does not have a wide screen version of this movie. I am also disapointed in the special features or lack there of. I am a DVD lover and I look forward to the extras that DVD's offer. But if you don't have a widescreen TV and an elaborate sound system and you like the movie than go ahead an buy it. Otherwise get the VHS"
4,First,"A delightful film of role reversal, as Michael Keaton loses his job and must stay home to take care of the house and kids while his wife goes to work. Keaton is charming and effective in the role, and a ton of great actors are sprinkled throughout the film. Certain parts are now showing a little age, but the film is still enjoyable. This picture loses a star because it is not presented in widescreen format. Check out Gung Ho for more Keaton action."
4,Funny and Entertaining,"I like Michael Keatons comedic acting, he reminds me of Jim Carrey a little. I think the movie is light but it makes you laugh. The things that happen when he is the mom of the house are done in a way that stand out and are really funny. The relationship he has with his family is so warm and easygoing. I liked when he plays coupon poker with the women. His wife who is played by Teri Garr is also down to earth and comedic. She takes on the male role of the household and becomes quite good with advertising. I liked the couples way of interacting with each other and with their real connection they had with their children. It was an entertaining film and it made me laugh. The things that would be fun to do if you had people who wanted to play would be coupon poker. That seems like a fun thing to do."
4,MR. MOM,"I have looked for this movie for a long time. It is a hard to find movie, because it is 15+ years old. I am thrilled to finally find it.Thank youcharld2000"
2,all you needs to know about Mr. Mom:,"Michael Keaton races with flippers on. and makes grilled cheese with an iron. and gets jealous when he thinks Martin Mull has designs on (oh yes, it's true!) TERI GARR. do we have to say it's written by John Hughes? wait for it to just come on TV."
2,Not Novel Enough,"8/16/03 VHS movie is ""sitcom worthy"" but not novel enough in my opinon for theatre goers. Actors are all good which helps to keep interest more in the actors and their ability to portray stereotypical roles in a stereotypical plot on middle class ,jobs and joblessness"
2,Generic Role Reversal Comedy That's Well Past its Sell-By Date,"The family man loses his job and swaps roles with Susie Homemaker in this base, straight-ahead '80s family comedy. Michael Keaton was just entering the thick of his early comedic career here, and plays the lead with enthusiasm despite an exceptionally thin script. Through physical humor and an overdose of energy he's able to wring as much life as possible from several one-note scenes, but can't completely revive such a narrow concept. John Hughes gets the writing credit, but this effort is missing both the sharp wit of National Lampoon's Vacation and the warm, beating heart of his brat pack classics. It's telegraphed, generic and dated; a few scenes still work but the rest are thoroughly flat and fake."
4,the hopefuls,"good album, catchy songs that aren't particularly original, but still fun to listen to. the band's name is now the hopefuls, not the olympic hopefuls. something about the word olympic being off limits."
1,Turgid melodrama,"I too had high hopes for this book and I have always had a soft spot for Norman/Anglo-saxon romance. Alas, this was a stinker.Varin is sent by the Conqueror to handle the situation at an important castle. Naturally the daughter of the house, Lady Eaditha is a spit-fire determined to hate the Norman swine.And she hates and hates and hates etc. Very repetitive and Eaditha is a childish, spiteful nit-wit.Varin is little better, being a sulky bear.There is a decent story lurking beneath this tale, but unfortunately the writing style used submerges it almost completely. Occasionally it grabs the reader's attention, but then the dreadful, over written, turgid style strangles it.Too bad."
3,Gothic Doom,"With a name like ""Rotting Christ"" you are certain to have many fans.....and many enemies. But when I listen to there music I am almost hypnotized and put under a spell. There music can be so relaxing and then sometimes you feel like getting up and moving around.The vocalist is not that talented. He sounds like a broken record but is able to pull it off to were it doesn't get on your nerves.""Dead Poem"" is there second best next to ""Sleep of the Angels"" which was there best work and nothing has touched it since. ""Dead Poem"" came with a extra (free) CD inside and it had almost twenty free songs. Hey that was really cool!If you like dark gothic doom metal then this is for you, but if you hate music that is dark and gloomy go listen to something else.Rotting Christ ~ 6 stars out of 10 starsFan of Rotting Christ, check out:Flauros: Monuments of Total HolocaustHarvist: A Gleam in the NightEngorge: Dead...F*ck...Blackness""Eternal Lies: Spiritual Deception"
4,Fun but sometimes tedious,"I really do like this game, it is fun and pretty neat. But some of the tasks you must complete seem pretty tedious. I do like that its not super action packed, because I'm not really into that kind of thing. I like games like the Sims3 and others, and this one is comparable action wise."
4,sort of fun,"this game is kinda fun. the graphics r great and it really challenges u. but i found at times i got really stuck and i would stop playing it for a while. also, sometimes i would get bored with it, and if u don't win a fight u have to start that part over. theres this one part where u have to gather all of the DA, which is about 21 kids. it takes awile. but alltogether, this game is pretty fun and exiting, and really challenges your brain."
2,HP AND THE PHOENIX,Spells are too difficult to consistently cast with the Nintendo controller. My daughters who love HP stuff are disappointed with the game and have no patience for it any more
3,"Not what I expected, but still fun!","I'm a huge Harry Potter fan so I thought the this game would be fun! When I had finally finished the instructions, which were long and detailed, I thought I'd be prepared for playing the game. I was very confused at times by which tasks to do first, and how to remember all the spell motions. It's more complicated than fun, sorry to say."
4,Collect Harry Potter stuff,"I like all Harry Potter stuff. I had to get this for wii. Already had it for ps2. No difference in the game set, same missions and all."
4,Better than expected,This was my first Harry Potter game and I found it to be fun. Using the Wiimote as a wand to cast spells made the game interesting. Trying to convince a new player to say the magic words outloud while playing is even more fun though.
4,Harry on the Wii,"My sons are looking forward to the other Harry Potter games coming to Wii, they have them for Gamecube, but would like the Wii version. the only thing my son complains about is that this is for one player and he wanted to duel with my other son taking on the role of another character. With the Wii remote acting as a wand, it gives the kids the REAL feel of Harry Potter, it should be multiple player."
2,Not user friendly!,I bought this for my 10 year old grandson who plays a lot on the WII and is a Harry Potter fan.....He was easily distracted and changed to something else rather quickly. This may be OK for an older player but I tried it and didn't like it either!
3,A shame it isn't multi-player,"My family has the Prisoner of Azkaban for PC, Goblet of Fire for PC, and Order of the Phoenix for Wii. We like the Prisoner of Azkaban a lot, possibly more than the OotP. Goblet of Fire is TERRIBLE. Order of the Phoenix would be much better if it had a multi-player capacity. Why can't you have three friends playing as Harry, Ron and Hermione, swapping about in the action? Also, I agree with the comments about the wandering around. It does get tedious. But my 9 year old loves it, as do all her friends."
4,"Good book, Makes learning SolidWorks easy","Overall speaking, this is a good book. The step by step (click by click) instructions makes learning the software easy and would bring a SolidWorks novice to a certain level depending on his/her CAD background. Highly recommended for people who don't have any Solidworks knowledge. I would give it a 5 of 5 if the author would fix some of minor mistakes in the book and add an index at the back like one other reviewer pointed out."
2,Could have been better,"I am In a class where we are using this as our text book.This book could have been alot better. For one thing it has a lot of mystakes, especially in the last few chapters. It does teach you many of the bassics of CAD. However, there is a lot of extrainious information that is unneccicary and tends to get in the way. Its very wordy. I did learn plunty from this book, but i think there might be better ones out there. The last two chapters had too many errors to make them very useful. Even my teacher could not figure out some of the things they were talking about, and he's been useing solidworks for years."
1,Membrell Didn't Work,I have osteoarthritis in my shoulder as well as cartilage degeneration. I tried the Membrell for 30 days and did not notice any difference. It didn't work for me.
2,They okay..,I tried it but it doesn't seem to be doing to much..Maybe you have to keep using them for months..
3,Not sure,So far can't say it has helped but will continue for a while. 6 weeks now. Will try for another 6 before giving up.
1,"Shame on you, Amazon - for even selling this homophobic artist's trash!","Come on, people....just zoom in on the little paragraph on the upper left side of the cover. Sizzla was dropped from the Tribute to the Reggae Legends concert this past February in San Diego (formerly known as the Bob Marley Festival), and it was because of his homophobic lyrics and attitude. Reggae music is supposed to be about love, but this moron (and Buju Banton as well) just doesn't get it."
5,This made my son think.,What more could I want? My son loves Dan Barker's children's books. The ideas are interestingly and simply set down without condescension. A great buy!
5,Original and Classy,"This is my favorite placesetting I have ever owned. Quality build, dishwasher safe, and it just looks great. Very classy and very original. Very natural appearance. Definately worth the price in my opinion for those who like quality dining ware."
5,Twelve Fingers Workin' Six Strings,"Hound Dog Taylor was born polydactyly - he had six fingers on both hands. One night in a drunken impulse, he cut off the extra digit on his strumming hand with a razor blade while leaving his fretboard hand with all six. For that reason alone, Hound Dog Taylor is the baddest MF to live in Chicago since Al Capone. While ""Scareface"" had machine guns to fire off in the streets of The Windy City, old ""Eleven-Fingers"" had his raw voice, gritty guitar, punk boogie, and sad stories to dredge up from the back alley dumpsters of Chi-town."
1,Purchase at Your Own Risk,"Some lamps are hit or miss. For me, this one was a miss. The lamp burned out after 167 hours. My projector is mounted in a cool and dry location and the original manufacture lamp lasted 3000+ hours. Keep in mind this lamp is manufactured by Polaroid and not Mitsubishi."
4,Great value,This bulb and housing was an exact fit for my HC-1600 at less than half the cost of a Mitsubishi bulb. After two months seems as good as the original bulb.
5,Great product,"Was just what I expected. Replacement was not too challenging. I was a bit concerned given the cost if I broke it while putting it in, but it was pretty durable and went in like a snap."
2,4.233 piston size and had trouble,"I read a lot of reviews and thought I would give Lisle a shot, but it scratched my piston, cheap handle, and it would not tightening up equally around the piston. I also bought a Proform 66768 Red Adjustable Piston Ring Compressor. I am very impressed with the Proform! However, I had to bend the proform to work but it is soooo smooth. No tapping required!"
3,Ring compressor 21700,Ring comp. arrive wet and rusty in the package. Product package was wet. Mailing package was dry so it seems to me whoever packaged the item knew it was this way and package it anyway. Other than that I cleaned the rust up and it worked fine.
1,Very Unstable in DivX Conversion,"Have owned the turbo.264 for about 3 weeks. I have an iMac Intel on the most recent version of OSX, and an Elgato EyeTV which is terrific.I upgraded the Turbo.264 software to version 1.3 as soon as I got it and it has worked well in converting EyeTV files to Apple TV format.BUT it has been virtually useless in converting AVI (DivX) files to Apple TV h.264. It continually crashes during the conversion process - and it's not being caused by the file format, because in subsequent attempts it will successfully complete a conversion. I have reinstalled the software and the hardware but to no avail. I am going to send it back to the vendor for a refund.I've read other reports of software crashes in quite a few forums.And it's not all that quick at converting."
4,Works as advertised!,Easy to install and works as it was billed. My only problem with it is doesn't work with some AVI files that I wish it did.
2,Support is HORRIBLE,"I can not comment on the product. Seemed to work twice, now it is dead. However, ElGato's support is HORRIBLE. Whatever their products I would recommend thinking twice before buying a product form them.1) Online support is all there is. I can find no way to actually talk to someone.2) Response time is SLOW. I filed my initial question, it took almost 2 weeks to get the first boiler plate try this try that (which didn't help) reply from them and now I am waiting for a reply back from my ""it didn't work tell me how to get an exchange"" email. We are going on 16 days and counting and my problem is NO WHERE close to being resolved.If you really had a complicated problem I don't see how you could get it resolved.I think they took a big hit from selling a lot of stuff at MacWorld 2008 and are having problems responding, but this is totally unacceptable."
4,Exactly what it claims.,"I bought this device to do video conversions on an older mac. Without the device it takes hours to do a conversion; with the device it takes about 1 hour to convert a 1 hour video. On my system this is about a 4 fold increase. On newer systems the change isn't so dramatic but is enough to still warrant purchase.The interface is simple and clean: drag and drop the files you want to convert, select the output quality and it does the conversion giving you a fairly good estimate of the time to completion. The only drawback is you can't set all the parameters you want when you convert. It comes with adequate settings ( 2 ipod settings, PSP, and Apple TV) such that you may not even need additional settings.Overall, I would recommend this product without reservation."
1,Handbrake is faster,Is actually slower and less configurable than the new version of Handbrake.I have a Mac Mini 1.8gHzI'll be careful next time...
3,Quick and nice,"I've tested this little gadget for a while and once I downloaded version 1.3 I got a few more options when encoding videos. I encode them with the ""iPod High"" profile at 1000 kbps for video and 44100 kHz/128 kbps for audio, which is the combination that has given me the best results for size and quality. I play the videos on a regular 24-inch TV using an Archos 605 and it works fine. However H.264 at a 1000 kbps on HandBrake will give you a higher resolution and a notably better quality.If your purpose is to encode your videos more quickly while you use your Mac for other things, this will be good for you. But if picture quality is more important to you than that, check again after a few software updates. I like it and I will hold on to it, as I'm not too obsessed with picture quality myself."
2,Quick and dirty conversion,"Potential buyers are advised to check out the numerous reviews and especially the end-user support forum at Elgato's web site that report poor quality, fuzzy video produced by this device.If you want quick encoding, you will get it -- but at a steep loss in quality. That's a shame for an encoding device at the price Elgato asks for the Turbo.264 and the Turbo.264HD. Handbrake produces much higher quality video and while it is slower, it is also free.Elgato needs to make some serious improvements in video quality."
2,"Seems to work, but not that great for a powerful MAC","I bought this for my 2.8Ghz iMAC, and found no appreciable difference between iMovie and Quicktime behavior. So for me, it is not worth the money.I am not using the Elgato proprietary software, and cannot speak to how well that will work. Also, I would not be surprised to find out that a less powerful machine might be bettered using this device, so it may have a fit somewhere, just not with me."
3,Decent Devotional,"Not sure that the Westminster Shorter Catechism warrents two years of daily family devotionals; seems to me that would drag. Most of the devotional thoughts weren't very well developed. Used the book as a guide in putting together a one-question-per-day devotional, and think this book would have been better suited developing each devotional more thoroughly in that format than stretching it out into so many days."
5,Training Hearts Teaching Minds,This is very well written and insightful book expounding on the shorter catechism. It clearly and accurately lays and reinforces a strong foundation in our belief in Jesus Christ and the truths of God's Word. It is a wonderful tool for teaching children of all ages as well as the parents. I highly recommend it!
5,A masterpiece of world literature!,"This is one of the best books I've ever read! The story of the ascencion and fall of a man, his sanity and madness, make us think about our human condition. Machado de Assis is undobted the best Brazilian writer."
4,Enjoyable CD,We enjoyed this cute CD when my kids were young and now we're sharing with the grandkids.
1,THE GIRLS ARE CUTE. THE SONGS AREN'T.,"The girls are adorable, but they can't sing for beans. They should just stick to acting and leave singing alone. They are not singers. This group of songs is not good."
1,I AM THE CUTE ONE IS A VERY BORING CD,"I HATE THIS CD SO BAD. The only songs that I love the most..Peanut Butter, Brother for Sale, Neighborhood Kitch Pots And Pans Rhythm Band, Identical Twins, Uh-Oh Accident, and Identical Twins. I say this not so bad after all. I still hate this CD though. I have been watching the twins since they were on the TV show called Full House when they were babies."
1,Cheap JUNK!!!!,"I had this less than 2 weeks, accidentally dropped it in the shower and the portion of the handle above the rubber grip broke off! I'll be investing in a more expensive wooden one next. This is a cheap piece of junk. Do NOT waste your money."
5,A pity no Amercian listener will ever buy it!,"I am Italian, so you might think I'm partial, no way! I listen to very little Italian music, I don't like Italian music, but this is one of the few exceptions. Carmen is a mix between Sinead O'Connor and Skunk Anansie, and is definitely worth buying even for people who don't speak Italian and therefore cannot understand the beautiful lyrics she writes. Her melodic skill is well above the average, and this is really a beautiful album. The music is pure rock, but her peculiar voice and her good composition skills make it very different from the average.Try it, you will not be disappointed!"
4,Amazing Talent!,"She is a real Songwriter, Artist and Musician, not some self proclaimed throaty diva who's voice comes from a voice box and can barely handle a guitar, their entertainment at best is only skin deep if you know what I mean (Shakira excluded). To be frank having worked with many celeb's, Carmen Consoli is one to watch. She has been performing since the age of nine and not only is an acclaimed songwriter/musician but an influential spark in the rock/blues/punk genre. Her sound is moving and electrifying, you really should experience her music.Noted trac's on this CD are 2, 4, 5, 7 and 10. I also recommend; 'Un Sorso in Più', 'Stato di Necessità', and the song 'Orfeo' (`return me to life') a live performance at the Greek Taormina is deeply touching and hauntingly beautiful, my favorite."
3,Never Underestimate Women,"I think Bridget Fonda does a really good job in this remake of the French movie, ""La Femme Nikita"". She's very believable in the action scenes and Gabriel Byrne & Harvey Keitel are always great in any movie. I loved seeing Anne Bancroft - she was, as always, superb! The best thing about this movie for me was introducing me to Nina Simone! I had never heard of her before, but when I heard her music (Bridget's character listened to her on her headphones) I had to hear more - I just love Nina's music! Some say the American remakes of foreign films never live up to the original, but I believe this one's worth watching - especially if you've thought women can't handle the tough jobs as well as men."
3,Point of no Return,"I saw this movie years ago, and remembered being completely thrilled after seeing it. It didn't fail to entertain when I saw it again last week. I don't imagine it was a blockbuster, and it's nice to have movies on the shelf that no one's seen before- provides new entertainment for a crowd who's tired of seeing the same thing again and again.For those who dig spy/assassin/sniper type movies, this one is a must-have."
3,ehh,"so this movie was okay... but mainly i was just confused . its the story of a woman (fonda) from the streets who is ""saved"" by a kind of mafia-like group who demand that she become both a lady and an assassin in return for her life . they leave her alone until they want something from her, so when she attempts to continue her life, she keepts getting interrupted by unfortunate phone calls at the most inopportune times telling her to go to the window and shoot the man in the blue hat with the uzi under the cabinet . so yeah it was okay . the original french version ""la femme nikita"" was better . but dermot mulroney was good as the deceived and confused boyfriend and gabriel byrne was better as fonda's assassin-trainer and boss . but still ho hum"
2,Completely pointless remake,"Decently acted, this American remake of Luc Besson's classic ""La Femme Nikita"" is still pretty flat, which is odd, because it literally copies the original nearly frame by frame, and the original has a truly magical spark and energy to it. If you've seen the original and then viewed this version, ""Point of No Return"" becomes an appalling experience that highlights the very worst creativity-by-committee aspects of Hollywood.Buy the original ""La Femme Nikita"", deal with the subtitles, and whatever you do, stay away from the dreary and over-dramatized TV series of the same name. ""La Femme Nikita"" is excellent, even if you don't like French movies (and to be honest the dubbed version on the most recent editions of that DVD is reasonably watchable), you'll like this one."
1,Hollywood directors treating its audience with contempt,"Having watched this film and its original French counterpart, <Nikita la Femme>, I have come to the conclusion that the directors of this (...) treated its audience with contempt. They think that American audience are usually don't like to imagine, speculate and think. Extra pointless scenes are added into this American (...) to make sure that the veil of mystery is lifted for its audience - which of course, defeats the purpose of thriller.Forget this film."
1,And if it ain't broke...,"What on earth posessed the director of this film to make it? With the exception of a few 'twists', this is a shot for shot rip off of Nikita, which is about a million times better in just about every way. I found myself literally closing my eyes in parts cos I just couldn't bear to see these actors make fools aout of themselves. If Luc Besson was dead, he'd surely be rolling in his grave. And LB, however much they paid you: it weren't worth it.And whose idea was it to have a nerdy harvey Kietel playing Victor the cleaner? Trying to capture the wooden efficiency of his vastly superior predecessor, jean Reno, kietel fails miserably & just ends up looking wooden. This was just a joke.If it ain't broke, don't try to fix it. I suggest you watch Nikita, & stay well way from this shocker. Cringeworthy stuff."
1,One star may be too much!,"Don't waste your time by seeing this film. Go see a real movie. Find the original ""La Femme Nikita"" for some real action and some real acting. I have been unable to watch a Bridget Fonda film since seeing this travesty. Maybe if I had not seen the original I would have been able to sit through this film."
1,La Femme Nikita for Dummies,"This movie was made for people who are too lazy to read subtititles. It has no heart or true vision. Buy the original on DVD. I only gave it one star ,because I had to."
2,"See the original, or see this version for Bridget Fonda","The Blu-ray picture looked better than I expected, although I noticed some edge enhancement in scenes with a lot of contrast. The movie itself is a nearly scene-for-scene remake of Luc Besson's Nikita, only with Bridget Fonda and without the pesky subtitles. Besson's original is the better film, but Fonda almost, but not quite, saves this version. The poster art was certainly cool."
4,Not a Bad Movie,"I think it is wrong to compare 'Point of No Return' to the original French film, 'Nikita'. After all, they are based in two different cultures at different times. That said, 'Point of No Return' is a very entertaining movie. Sure, it isn't a perfect film, but I don't know many that can not be criticized. Overall, it is a good movie. I agree with those who say that Nina Simone adds a lot of depth to the film. I first heard of her music through this film many years ago. What a gift?! That is worth watching the movie in itself. I would recommend this film to anyone."
5,DIFFERENT,"I LOVED this movie!It is an unusual plot with excellent acting, cinematography, and sound.If you want very realistic, non stop action with a different twist,and emotions that span the gamut, TRY this one out. I can't imaginehow you could be disappointed.This DVD will be one of my keepsakes. (Also, Bridget Fonda turns me on!)Rating: 10/10 5/5Bill SchaeferBerwyn, PA.ephraim@chesco.com"
4,Lots of action with good acting. Keeps you interested.,Bridget Fonda did an outstanding job as Nina in this movie. Action throughout with a bit of romance thrown in. You certainly don't know what will happen next and it will keep you in suspense. Good Blu-Ray quality.
4,"this is a version o french ""nikita""","Point of No Return is a wordwide blu ray version with many subs. Is a 1993 movie , because the age of the movie is for fans only.The point of the movie is: people change?"
3,Another descent American Action Film,"This film can be categorized as another good American action film. The neat thing about it is that there is no muscle bound male hero, or some major martial arts master. It is an ex-addict, cop killing, good looking Bridget Fonda.I find this film to be a good one when I am in the need of an action flick. Sure it may just be an average action movie, but watching Fonda run around killing people isn't too hard on the eyes.I found Point Of No Return quite refreshing.The DVD has a really nice menu interface. Too bad there aren't many features. A commentary would have been nice, but all we get is the trailer."
4,"This one was very good, but the French one in 1990 was better","I thought it was a very good rendition of the original movie, very interesting and overall a very fine movie to watch. The French version filmed in 1990 seemed more polished in it's delivery. The same director did this film, that was useful. I'd recommend it!"
4,"very good seller, and movie",This seller has gone beyond my expectations in dealing with a problem with the DVD. This is a good film.
4,From Street Punk to Sophisticated Killer,"There seems to be some kind of rule that dictates that critics pan any American remake of a French film. In this case, Point of No Return moves La Femme Nikita from the eastern side of the Atlantic to the states. I'm glad they did!Bridget Fonda stars as the punk soul turned hired killer, with Gabriel Byrne as her shadowy government agent/handler who offers her a lavish lifestyle in return for becoming a cold blooded killer. Fonda handles the role with ease, keeping you off balance with her transformation from street waif to lethal sophisticate.It all makes for a fast-paced thrill ride that relies on plot twists more than car chases. Okay, so maybe it isn't a major cinematic achievement worthy of the Palme d'Or at Cannes, but it's a very watch-able, enjoyable movie!"
3,Nice try,"Loved Bridget Fonda, but this really wasn't too impressive. Overly dramatic music, pretty campy. The various Nikita TV series are better than this."
1,Pathetic,"This is nothing but a lousy, flat, ""holywoodization"" of ""La Femme Nikita"" ripped off and stripped of the style, class, and suspense of that film while adding some silly bits. The Blu Ray version's lousy quality detracts from that to leave basic rubbish."
2,Get the original and enjoiy,"The french original has vastly more style and presence than this remake. Fonda, who does a very nice job in ""Kiss of the Dragon"", carries neither the street threat of the ""before"" or the conflicted calculating assasin of the ""after"". A copy in the worst sense."
1,"""return to the original""","Since I am a fan of the French version, La Femme Nikita, I was really excited to see and share this film with my family. Do yourself a favor, get the original. Part of what made the original so great was Nikita's transformation from a dirty druggie, to a sexy yet vunerable spy/agent. Bridget Fonda is soo unbelievable in this role it's appalling. 1) There is something about her personality and character that you really can't believe that she has suffered a day in her life. So she is no good as a drug addict 2) While I can see that people might find Fonda pretty, she lacks the hard core sexiness and strength that's needed to portray a secret agent. So she fails on both counts. The whole movie was so plain vanilla, it was sad. It's like expecting to go to a five star restaurant and get a five star dessert..and instead, you get the diet sponge cake that tastes like cardboard."
1,How many mistakes can occur in one book?!?!?,I am appalled at how many errors this book has that I found! The listing for Devil's Canyon's Primitive Trail has an absoultely ridiculous milage marker that makes no sense at all. The trail length for Tower Arch trail says it's 2.4 miles when the trail is actually 3.4 miles long. I got to where I would just go talk to the rangers at both Arches and Canyonlands National Parks about the trails rather than even open that book because it was completely unreliable. I am really surprised that it's a Falcon book because I thought they had better standards! Don't waste your money!!!
2,Poor choice for information on the Maze,"I bought this book to get information on hikes in the Maze area of Canyonlands. I was totally disappointed with the information that was contained in this 20 page section of the book. The hikes listed are uninformed choices that anyone spending a few minuets on the NPS web page can easily learn about, they are the obvious choices that are places to hike by on your way elsewhere in the Maze. It looks like the author may have spent little time exploring the Maze and has regurgitated some ""caned"" hikes here, give the book a pass if looking for information on the Maze. I would give it one star but the author has attempted some good organization and maps, he just needs to do some hiking in there."
1,Not helpful,"Poorly illustrated B/W maps, vague information, and not helpful for river runners at all. Elevation gain isn't even listed! Worst Falcon guide ever."
5,Les Brown Live,"We were very happy with this product and as usual, Les Brown has the motivational skills to get people to improve themselves."
5,"A Beautiful, Dark Album","It's been almost 12 years since I first heard this album, and I doubt there has been a stretch of more than a month during that period when I haven't put it on. It's that kind of album. I think eight different tracks have, for a time, been my ""favorite"" - with some that I initially dismissed slowly making their way to the top of the list. Dark (ala Nick Drake), often dense and beautiful (ala Doves), sometimes sparse and haunting (ala Elliot Smith), Parasite still manages to be uplifting and continually interesting."
3,Some kind of XTC in a bad mood.,"The singer is great. His voice is profound and the song titles ain't easy to be told , I mean, they are deep. However, I think that this band made its best effort on track 13, then the others try to follow it without the same result. Good music, kind of 80's drums and great instrumentation. Buy it."
5,Speaker for the Dead,"""They must not disturb the piggies""On the colony of Lusitania in far off space some scientists discover a new species of intelligent life.The colony was living peacefully with the new species nicknamed the piggies until one night when the piggies murdered a human.Ender Wiggin then arrived on the colony of Lusitania in order to speak for the dead.Then the government finds out what they are doing on Lusitania and convict them of treason and order the planet to be evacuated!What will happen to the citizens of Lusitania?What will the citizens of Lusitania do about being convicted?I really enjoyed reading Speaker for the Dead.Orson Scott Card really brings the charcters to life in this novel and makes it very dramatic.I recommend this book for anyone who loves science fiction and reading about alien species."
4,Wonderful!,"My review of this book is probably influenced by the fact that Orson Scott Card is my favorite writer, and I like anything that he writes. However, 'Speaker for the Dead' is truly a worthy succesor to 'Ender's Game'. If you liked 'Ender's Game', you'll almost certainly like 'Speaker for the Dead'.'Speaker for the Dead' lacks the emotional connection that one has when reading 'Ender's Game'. But the words on the pages are well written and the story is very interesting. Card is truly a master of science-fiction, and the 'Ender's Game' saga is undoubtebly one of the best series' ever written, and rivals such great works as 'Dune'.If you like science-fiction, read 'Ender's Game' and then read 'Speaker for the Dead'. You won't be disappointed."
3,Nowhere near as fast paced as the first.,"Once again, I would not put this novel in the sci-fi genre. It's an interesting study in human behavior intermixed with religious beliefs. The sci-fi aspect seems almost like an afterthought. I found this second one much too slow, with too much religion embedded into the story in fact. But my interest is still piqued enough to read the remainder of the series."
5,Human Insight Unveiled,"In Speaker, Card gives uncanny insight into humans and human pain though Ender's arrival on Lusitania. Ender's way of understanding and healing the complex situation of complete strangers is mindboggling. Simply by stating the truth, he both opens and heals the deep wounds of Novinha's family . If you have never felt that it is possible to ""know"" a situation or a person or to change the past, this is a great book to read. You will never think the same of raw honesty again."
2,Dissapointing after reading Ender's Game,"If like me you really enjoyed Ender's game beware: this book is quite different. I did not enjoy reading it, the attitude of the characters is infuriating and the author makes it seems as if the whole human race is made of idiots, except of course for Ender. A couple of intriguing concepts are introduced, but overall I was very disappointed."
3,Speaker For the Dead,I am currently reading Speaker For The Dead by Orson Scot Card. I am disapointed in the way the book is reading. I was hoping that the book Speaker For The Dead would pick up right were Ender's game left off. But instead the book starts off talking about new characters and personally it is very hard and is not reading very fast. after a few chapters into the book Ender finally comes into the book but does not have the charisma he had in Ender's Game. In Ender's Game Ender was a very tough and brave young man. By the end of Ender's Game Ender was a war hero and had a very good military mind. now Ender seems like he has become a woosie.
3,Speaker For The Dead (slow start),"I am now reading Speaker, and right now it is very hard reading. Other reviews that i have heard is that the book picks up in the middle of the book. In the very beging of the book there are characters that were not in Ender's Game and it has me a little confussed."
4,Not as addicting as Ender's Game,"The first chapter had me glued, and then it was a roller coaster of not wanting t put the book down. Overall, it wasn't as good as Ender's Game but was a pretty good book. Hoping the rest of the series doesn't go down hill from here."
1,No sequel is Ender's Game,"Speaker for the Dead, as well as every sequel to Ender's Game, is not worth reading. There is very little of the interesting, strange thought process that made Ender's Game excellent, and there is none of the military strategy. If you liked the military strategy, you won't find it in any of Orson Scott Card's sequels. You might as well just read a non-fiction book, such as Victory and Deceit, by Dunnigan and Nofi."
1,Could not finish it,Too much religion and preaching in this book. hoping to read something in the lines of Ender's game. I know Card likes to mixes religion in his work but this is too much to the point of being boring. I just thought my time could be used in something better.
2,stick with ender's game,IMPORTANT NOTE: STICK WITH ENDER'S GAME!!! this is just like the matrix...only the first one was good...don't dissapoint yourself by buying this book...i've been reading this book for 2 months...it is so boring that i don't even want to read it anymore...i got to page 91...it's still boring...BORING BORING BORING!!! i plan to read ender's shadow...try reading that if you liked ender's game
5,An interesting sequel,"After reading Enders Game I had high expectations of Speaker for the Dead. I enjoyed the book but found it to be quite different from Card's first in the series. There is not as much action and more philosophy. If you read for intrigue, irony, and plot you will greatly enjoy this novel. If you like lots of action, you may be disappointed. It is definitely worth reading for the sophisticated SF reader"
5,The best sci fi sequel ever!,"An amazing continuation of the heroic ""Ender's Game"" novel.Events so moving that the reader can't help but sympathizewith the characters. Written by one of the greatest writersof all time."
2,Sorry,"This book really didn't do it for me. I know it has won tons of awards, and I know most reviewers seem to cherish it, but that was not my experience. Ender's Game was a coming of age space opera with a conscience. Card balanced all of the elements to create a masterpiece. I am not sure what this book is. Apparently, Ender has become Doctor Phil and inserted himself into a Latin American soap opera (yes I know they were Portugese). There were certainly some interesting episodes in the book, but overall I was disappointed."
4,"Good, but there's just ONE thing.","I hate it when authors ""discover"" a new religion or culture or something and practicly BASE the ENTIRE book on that. This book is all portrogese, and I have nothing against them, but it really depresses me to see something like that happen to a great author like Card."
2,a bad book,"I'll explain by giving an example A sequel to this book could be this ""Ender goes back in time, saves John F. Kennedy, travels first to the moon, brings a Cure to Cancer, travels again through time and dies as Jesus"". Ender does everything. It's so stupid. I really liked the first book, I would've given it a 9, but this..I think this book should never have been written."
4,Solid follow-up to Ender's Game,Read Ender's Game on a recommendation and purchased Speaker for the Dead before I was even finished with the first book. Orson Card does a great job of pivoting from one story to the next that I was unable to put down Speaker for the Dead.
3,It's ok.,"After reading Ender's Game, this book was a big let down. It definitely does not live up to Ender's Game.I'm going back to read Ender's Game again!!!!"
5,This actually needs to happen,"I wish the things in this book would become accepted practice. I don't want to spoil it, so I will be slightly non-specific. The way we deal with death effectively covers up or erases the actual person. In Card's imagination, the opposite becomes possible."
5,More great work from Card,"The Ender Series and the Bean Series have just been incredibly enjoyable books to read, and Speaker for the Dead is no exception. It was a little tough transitioning from the plot and story around Ender's Game to the less action, more character driven books that followed, but after you get used to it, you really appreciate Card's ability to bring out the best in his characters."
4,an excellent argument for genre crossover,"this is the kind of book which renders genre snobs, who value ""literary novels"" as the only legitimate kind of literature writing, stupid. everything that makes a book great literature is present in the Ender series. a science fiction book can find a way to include all of the great themes of mankind since the advent of writing (The Iliad and the the Odyssey, etc.). This also happens to be a great science fiction genre book, and thank the goddess, it's not noticeably video game based. it's allegory heavy, but not so heavy that it stops the action. there is a lot here to think about long after you finish the book."
4,not as good as original ender but enjoyable,"This book does not have the battle scenes nor does the plot twist as in the original Ender story. But Orson Scot Card tells a good entertaining story. More points are fleshed out without becoming too mystical as Card sometimes has a tendency to do in some of his books. If you like Enders series, you will like this one. If your only exposure is original Ender you may find it slightly different and a little slower paced."
5,speaker for the dead,"Very exciting, the story was of Ender continued so the reader was kept interested. I will also read the next book in the series."
4,What I wanted? No - A great book? - yes,"I wanted more of a story of Ender as a child genius, that was the only disappointment to this book. This book was a little harder to read as it dealt with much bigger and thought provoking ideas. It is obvious that a lot of thought and planning went into the telling of this story. I truly enjoyed reading this book and look forward to revisiting it again in a few years."
4,Great perspective of co-dependence,"This book is one of my favorites. There is a Chapter called ""Jane"" that is soooo interesting. It explains co-dependency between a computer program and a human. It tells how the program goes into depression, then anger, and then forgiveness. The program ""retreated into herself"" and then learned to love from afar, just as humans do when we need to re-evaluate when we have become too attached to someone else. Very cool!"
4,Buy it for the Ideas not the Plot,"This books has some great humanist ideals and philosophy despite the political views of its author. Unfortunately the plot is predictable and you probably won't be blown away, but the idea of having speakers of the dead did give me a lot to think about."
2,A let down ...,"I loved Enders Game, and this book won just as many awards ... But, it just doesn't hold up.First, the idea of Ender, the most famous guy in the galaxy being able to hide his identity is ridiculous. Don't they have images and voice recordings?Second, the whole guilt laden, crucify oneself aspect spoke to a serious neurosis, not something to be celebrated. The friggin queen bugs were in his head! And, they wanted Ender to plant their spawn out in space where it could be the root to the force that wipes out humanity. He is carrying this hideous thing around with him and talking to it like Harvey the Rabbit.Sorry, I just could not make the leap."
5,this book speaks to me...,"This book was an interesting change in direction from Enders Game. The story is not very action packed, but it continues where Ender's Game left off and satisfies those of use who wanted more! Go buy this one as well as the first book and you will not be disappointed. (the other two books in the quartet are so-so. book 3 being like book 2 only weirder and boring)"
2,Not as good as Ender's Game,"Although Speaker for the Dead is a decent story overall and does have some great sci-fi elements, like relativistic space travel, I didn't think it was anywhere near as good as Ender's Game. I thought of it like Return of the Jedi if the rebels spent the whole movie pondering the social behavior of the ewoks.Of course we're not talking about Star Wars or movies here. Speaker for the Dead was just a peculiar departure from Ender's Game, which is one of the best novels I've ever read. I almost felt like Card decided he didn't really feel like writing another sci-fi novel, so he went with a biologist drama instead."
2,Ender's Game flew by...SFTD just plods...,"""Speaker For The Dead"" suffers from the same sophomore-outing problems M. Night Shyamalan's ""Unbreakable"" movie did--too much exposition of not enough plot. Whereas ""Unbreakable"" would have made a great 30-minute Twilight Zone episode, stretching it to fill an hour and a half was a bad idea. Same with SFTD. The big mystery isn't all that mysterious, and there aren't that many possible resolutions, yet it drags on for hundreds of pages longer than it should have.If you want more of the Ender Saga, skip the SFTD/Xenocide/Children of the Mind branch for now, and go with the much more Ender's-Game-like ""Shadow"" branch. THEN come back and pick up the other, and you'll be more satisfied with it."
4,A good book but not Ender's Game,"I would assume that most readers of this book would be those who recently read and were excited by Ender's Game. If you are a fan of Mr. Card's writing then you will probably enjoy this book - but BEWARE! It strays quite a bit from the light story telling and fun of Ender's Game and is a much ""darker"" book.I enjoyed it, but only when I looked at it on it's own merits and not as a sequel to Ender's Game. Unfortuately, Ender's Game is a must read if you are going to really follow the characters and story in Speaker for the Dead.I guess it's hard to follow Ender's Game - but did Mr. Card have to take such a turn away from what made Ender's Game great? Still a good read on it's own merits - just don't have Ender's Game-type expectations."
2,Tree People,"Ender saves the universe yet again. The new all knowing all seeing Ender saves the pig (vegetable people). A stupid immature scientist hides important data because of misplaced guilt. She then creates a miserable disfunctional family, and the soap opera moves sideways from there."
2,Average start and is downhill from there,"After reading Ender's Game (which I give 3 stars), I was just curious enough to try the next installment. This book was a major disappointment. The plot never seemed to get off the ground and I just couldn't get into the characters. This is a relatively flat story and nothing to get excited about. I will not be reading anything further in the Ender saga. There is too much good reading out there to spend any more time on this series."
2,Not Free SF Reader,"Extended eulogy journey.Ender, now many years in the future of the actual events of the Bugger War thanks to the usual effects of fast space travel.He is basically working as someone that delivers overextended eulogies or life histories for people after their deaths, and ends up on a planet where he may be able to do something to save a race, rather than destroy one.Unfortunately this is all quite tedious at times, and could certainly do with trimming and rather belabors the point excessively.2 out of 5"
3,The Real Story (after the prelude),"I have to say I enjoyed this one much more than -Enders Game-, there didn't seem to be as much filler. It is strange though because, Card comes up with these really cool sci-fi ideas but then writes his characters so well and fills the situation with such human emotion that the cool ideas get kind of overshadowed. I really like both aspects but for some reason they don't add up and blow me away. So in the end this is the kind of book that I would enjoy on audio but wouldn't really want read in book form (over a period of 4 or 5 weeks - at my speed).The next book is available on audio so I'll probably listen to it sooner or later but I'm not super excited about it."
5,Great book for Sci-Fi Newcomers,"Before reading Ender's Game and Speaker for the Dead, my interest in Science Fiction was limited to your basic Star Trek storylines. When I read the first few pages of both books, I was hooked. The writing style, the plot, everything was great!Speaker for the Dead really captivated me because it was more philosophical and alot like the social science issues I've studied.I think anthropologists, political scientists, and others could really relate to this book and get into science fiction. The ideas and concepts are brilliant, and Card's words just flow. It should certainly be a part of high school and college learning materials!"
3,A letdown,"Though well-written, this book is just a little too preachy and long-winded for my taste. I think it may been better as a short story. Though I really love a lot of Card's work, methinks I have detected a pattern, or at least a recurring moral theme, that seems to run through virtually every book or series he writes. This theme involves the issue of genocide. It appears in Treason, where Mueller contemplates the extinction of the Andersons, in the Alvin Maker series, where the extinction of the Prophet's followers raises the same issues, in Ender's Game, where the extinction of the bugs is the issue, and in Speaker for the Dead, with the contemplated genocide of the piggies and descolada. By Speaker for the Dead, I got tired of revisiting this same issue and it unfortunately continues in the next books in the series. Not recommended."
2,Ender Saga continues with new characters and a tired plot.,A ineffective plot with a few surprises. I barely finish this marathon of tedium
2,Wincing in pain,"If you can wade through all of the painfully cheesy heartstring pulling and redundancy/bad writing then you'll find a couple really cool ideas, the coolest of which is Jane, a sentient computer program which teams up to help Ender tackle his problems. The overall plot of the story adds to the scope of Card's universe, however I found myself literally wincing in pain throughout the book, eventually just skimming the last 100 pages just to find out the plot resolution so that I could put the book back on the shelf where it belongs. All said, you'd do better to get the Cliffs notes rather than damage your opinion of Ender/Card."
4,Excellent and well-written,"I enjoyed this book a great deal. I absolutely loved Ender's Game, and although this is a very different novel from Ender's Game, it is just as riveting. The author really stretches the reader's imagination. His characters look and sound so real they just about jump off the page. I have just two criticisms that prevented me from awarding 5 stars - First, I found the religious pontificating a bit much. And lastly, I found that it took me quite a while to distinguish between the many characters. (Ouanda, Olhado, Quim, Quara, Pipo, Libo and Miro.) Luckily the author provided family trees for the characters in the introduction. Another page that I needed to fold down for reference was the page that defined framling, raman and varelse. I'm afraid I'm hooked on this series, so excuse me, I'm off to buy Xenocide to see what happens next!"
4,Good followup to Ender's Game,"Although this book was not as good as Ender's Game, it is still a great read. For a long while I could not put this book down because of the suspense and mystery. The book starts out with the planet Lusitania, a colonist planet settled Portegeuse Catholics, where the only other intelligent race, the Pequininos or piggies for short, live. At first the piggies are regarded as an animal and not a real race. The people study them and are fascinated with their culture. But they cannot ask the piggies a direct question. Meanwhile Ender lives on the ice planet known as Trondheim. He is a speaker for the dead, but not the Speaker for the Dead because this book takes place over 3 thousand years in the future."
3,MOT AS GOOD AS ENDERS GAME,I LIKED THIS BOOK. HOWEVER I FEEL IT WAS NOT AS GOOD AS THE FRISTONE. THIS SEEMED MORE CLASSIC SI--FI. IT WAS STILL GOOD HOWEVER. AT FRIST I WAS GOING TO STOP READ IT BUT THEN I STUCK WITH AND I GLAD I DID.
2,disappointment,"Too sentimental, too much ethical blabla. Distracting use of Portugese.Not anywhere near the quality of Ender's game, Ender's shadow."
3,Imaginative but left me somewhat wanting.,"I was between 3 and 4 stars for this book because in a lot if ways it works as a decent sequel to Enders Game. The reason I gave it 3 was because it in no way measured up to the original Game. Overall, decent read, imaginative, strange, magical and sometimes a little boring. The major pluses for me are things to ponder like the way time is manipulated through starflight."
5,Awesome,This book was awesome. It was better then the first book. I hope they make this book series into movie.
4,Best in the series,"Speaker for the Dead is the best book in the Ender Wiggins series. You can't even put it in with Ender's Game because you can probably get away with reading either book as seperate stories. That's the brilliance of these two books: Just as in real life a man's lifestory cannot be told in one volume. He changes in the interveining years. I loved the theme and premise for this book so much that I ran right out and read Xenocide and Children of the mind. I regretted that decision. Both were long, boring and intolerable. By the end of Children I cared little except having time to read another more worthwhile book.Even though Speaker for the Dead continues I would recomend you stop with that one and read Orson Scott Card's other works instead."
3,Loved Ender's Game but dislike this book!,"Ender's Game (1985) is one of the all-time best SF books. It deservedly won the Hugo and Nebula awards. It's routinely read in schools and is a genuine classic. It's also a crowd pleaser- a book that nearly everyone likes.Speaker for the Dead (1987) is the direct sequel and also won the same awards. However, in tone and plot, it's a VERY different book. For the right reader, who likes thoughtful, slow-paced stories about culture and alien/human interaction (think Ursula LeGuin), this book is a gem. For everyone else, this book will be a huge disappointment. If you fall into the latter category, and haven't read Ender's Game yet, then don't let this (or Card's other work) discourage you at all from checking out Ender's Game.Which book is ""better"" is definitely debatable- but there's ZERO doubt that Ender's Game is the far more popular work."
5,Great Book,"Comes together well with Ender's Game. Card himself say's that Ender's Game is just a setup for Speaker, and he did bring together the series quite well.Also note that the people that gave this book a 1 out of 5 are very biased and seemingly uneducated. One even states that he didn't understand what some words they used meant. Being fictional words made up by Card, I would be able to understand this, except for the fact that the book explains what the words mean every-so often.Be warned, though. This book is more adult than Ender's Game. Not in a sex/violence way, but the characters display adult attitudes."
5,"Again, Card is magnificent.","Card maintains his throne in the oligarchy of good modern fiction. Speaker for the Dead is a marvelous continuance of Ender's Game. It is gracefully followed by Xenocide, then Children of the Mind (which I'm finishing now).Card is wonderful both for a great read and for providing true insights on life and living together.Perhaps what I'd most recommend, however, in Maps in a Mirror: the Short Fiction of Orson Scott Card. The hardback is out of print, but it's being re-released in four softbacks. There are stories are from all genres, and he provides his inspirations and insights for the stories, which is wonderful. Imagine - Card doing horror!"
2,Nothing happens!,"ENDER'S GAME was gripping and it recaptured the feelings of childhood for me. But SPEAKER FOR THE DEAD was disappointing: the plot is slow, the characters are boring, the premise is unbelievable, and the philosophy is pretentious.The most exciting moment in this book occurs when a small child urinates on the protagonist!"
1,Terrible,"This book was terrible. I really enjoyed Ender's Game, and have read most of the Foundation series, all of the Hyperion books (which were great), and love to find good science fiction books. I am not a science fiction expert, but do enjoy good stories. This was not in that category, I plowed through it- but finally gave up with 50 pages to go. Don't waste your time."
1,Very distrubing and destroys what the first book sets up,"The character Ender has grown some 20 years while the universe around him has aged 3,000 years since he fought in the Bugger War. What I loved about the first book is the strong connection of love between Ender and Valentine, which had moved me to tears. However in the second installment, this bond between brother and sister is ripped apart when Ender again decides to travel, leaving his sister behind. I couldn't stand to read the book any longer, and put it away. That bond that I looked forward to reading about was ripped apart, and I couldn't continue. It is a lousy book, which i do not recommend."
2,Not all that great,"Ender's Game was a much better novel in my opinion. Speaker For The Dead reminded me much of a drunk man trying to walk a straight line stumbling ever so often and taking breaks to explain why. I found myself glancing over entire sections of a few chapters simply because they lended no contribution to the storyline or were repeated for an empty dramatic effect. All in all, it was a rather plain and boring novel."
3,Not the same story as the original,"Card notes in a lengthy forward that this was the real story he wanted to tell, but wrote Ender's Game to set all the details first. I really enjoyed Ender's Game for what it was, albeit somewhat sad. This book is not like that. Some of the characters have remained, but the context is all different. Ender has lived another several thousand years at this point by traveling through space which slows down his actual aging. The concern is about researchers in a small Catholic colony-planet and their research on the native creatures. There are few meaningful events spurring on the reader which makes it drag along like a dying buffalo at times."
1,Oh My God!!! Not Another Horrible Scan Version!!,"I had recently complained to Amazon that Ender's Game had been scanned and then poorly edited prior to releasing it here for sale. Now I get into Speaker for the Dead, and if anything, this copy is even worse than the first book. I am finding that the same issues that plagued the first book are there, and now letters are even missing from words. The last few chapters really show where the publisher just gave up even trying to find anything...not that they seem to have caught the issues with words containing ""ru"" in them.I am getting to think that some of these digital presses are just sending straight OCR copies over to Amazon as quick as they get a file completed.Amazon...get some quality control going before you allow a book to be put up for sale!!"
3,An enjoyable but not great book,"Orson Scott Card's first novel in this series, 'Ender's Game,' was one of my favorite books. Unfortunately, 'Speaker for the Dead,' the second sequel to 'Ender's Game,' does not live up to the excitement and imagination of its predecessor. 'Speaker for the Dead' is still an okay book, but nowhere near up to Mr. Card's potential.If you haven't read 'Ender's Game' yet, you should, but don't bother reading this book (at least not yet). If you have already read 'Ender's Game,' and you really liked the characters, then you might also enjoy 'Speaker for the Dead,' but be prepared to be disappointed."
2,Horrible Sequel to a Great Story,"I loved Ender's Game, I hated this book. It was long, drawn out and predictable. It lacks the humor found in parts of Ender's Game and the tension. The only common element is Ender, who seems to have grown older, more serious, and more depressed. I actually went back and re-read Ender's Game. Could this be the same author? Unfortunately yes. The style is so similiar it has to be written by the same person. But, when Mr. Card wrote this one, he seems to have forgetten the human element, the compasion, the soul, of the first book. I finished Speaker of the Dead constantly hopefully for something, somewhere in this book to justify the read. I never found it. I hope his other series is good. I am going to go to that next, instead of finishing this series."
3,The second book is definitely second best,"Initially I liked this one better than Ender's Game, but the ending... well, it kind of petered out. It was a slower paced book, with a lot smaller and less impressive climax. By the end I was getting that ""okay, okay, get on with it!"" feeling. The concept of a ""speaker for the dead"" is very interesting and compelling, but that was explained at the end of Ender's Game and so it lessened the impact it might have had in this book had it been the first mention of it. I had time between the books to think it over and draw a lot of my own conclusions. I did, however, like the character of Jane quite a bit, despite her small role. I guess the AI personality was just very intriguing as a evolutionary concept. I'd still highly rate this book, but I'm back to thinking Ender's Game was the better story."
3,Not a first,"Not that it should be a surprise but despite Amazon saying this is a first edition it is in no way close to a first. It came out 20 years ago, it would be a miracle if they had a new first edition for so cheap. Great book however. I highly recommend the series."
3,"good, but less gooder than Enders game","I thought Andrew Wiggin was too much of a Jesus figure in this novel. His character was much more accessible in the first book.It's a good book, and you really should read it after you've read the first one. I just expected more from all the reviews saying this was better than Ender's Game."
1,Book Two Ender Series,"It's rare that I can't make it halfway through a book, but this is one of those rare times. This book takes us some 2,000 years after the first book. So the amazing characters we came to know in the first book are of course now gone. Instead we have a different culture, different characters, religion has been injected and of all things Portugese slang. Then to top that mess off, we have words that apparently Card has made up and require an online search to gather the meaning of. I had to just put the book down, as it felt like a mess of disorganized thought. I really loved the first book and had put off reading it for years, and was disappointed in myself for doing so. So read book one, skip this one unless you're a glutton for punishment."
1,Hate it,I loved lenders games but this is just horrible there's not even battle schoolD o n o t g e t
2,Barely worth two stars to me...BORING!,"This book was a HUGE let down for me. I read, and thoroughly enjoyed Ender's Game, Ender in Exile, and Ender's Shadow. This is the first book in the Ender series I've read that I really struggled to even finish. Boring as hell. So much time spent on this alien race, trying to figure out their mating habits, then some stuff about some portugese catholics and how their religious beliefs are very much against the idea of a Speaker for the Dead....which by the way was a fact that was repeated MANY times... On top of the absolutely boring as hell plot, at no point did I find a reason to care much for the any of the characters involved.I'm continuing on and reading more of the Ender series, since 3 out of 4 that I've read were 4 & 5 star books. That being said, I have no idea how this book got so many five star reviews. Usually I agree with the masses on book reviews, but this time I guess I'm swimming upstream because this book sucked.BORING!!!!!"
2,Huge Disapointement,"Overall this is not the story of Ender Wiggen it is a story of someone else entirely. If you read Enders Game and you want more, this is not the book to read. I hope Card comes out with a book that does a huge twist and says this story was actually about a man with brain damage who thought he was Ender and the real Ender Wiggen is part of a new series that is actually exciting.The best analogy I can give is the difference between Enders Game and Speaker for the Dead is about the same difference between Lord of the Rings and Twilight."
4,"good, but not great science fiction","Like most readers, I came to this book after reading Ender's Game.Speaker for the Dead is much more ambitious - indeed Card considersEnder's Game a preamble - however I thought that it was also far lesssuccesful. The aliens are really no more alien than some of the nativetribes of Oceania where to the Europeans when they first came intocontact. The idea of the speaker is somewhat interesting, but thestory of first (and second) contact is overall a bit unsatisfying. I findit much more likely that, if it ever occurs, the first contact will be morelike the one described by Stanislaw Lem than that described by Card."
1,"It began well, yet ended poorly.","I did not enjoy this book, especially the beating of children and the adultery of Novinha. I didn't know what ramen, raman, utlanning, and varelse were, either. Other than that, it was an OK book."
2,Not Satisfied,"This item was advertised ""like new condition"", the book had a corner cut off and the pages looked weathered and aged (they were discolored). I would not buy a used book from this supplier again"
1,Speaker for the Dead,"Despite what people are saying, this book really isn't that great. I mean it is okay, but don't read it if you expect something like Ender's Game. Some of it is very good and interesting, but the book is boring sometimes. It is worth reading if you really want to read it. Go to the library and check it out. If you did happen to read this book, whether or not you liked it, I don't suggest reading Zenocide. I am waiting to get Children of the Mind, so I can't say anything about it."
5,An absolutely increadible book,"Speaker for the Dead really changed my outlook on life. The ideas and relationships described in it are so unique and yet true. I encourage everyone to read this fabulous book, as well as the other four in the series (Ender's Game, Xenocide, Children of the Mind and Ender's Shadow) I would love to discuss this book with anyone who has already read it. My e-mail is LilGrape25@aol.com. If you have not already read this book I urge you to do so immediately."
4,A good sequel to Ender's game,"Speaker for the Dead is a good sequel. Ender's game was powerful because of the stunning plot twist ending. This book is more subtle. There's more character development, more subtlety in the plot."
5,There are some scenes in this book that broke my heart ...,"and then put it back together. This is a far better book than Ender's Game, which I also liked. It's more thoughtful, more emotional, more mature than any science fiction novel I have ever read. Novinha touched me deeply. The scenes at the beginning of her at the funeral and then of her isolation as a child and later an adult made me cry. Ender was also a more attractive character in this book than in Ender's Game. I've read both of the sequels to this book, but I don't find them as good as this one."
4,Good for certain people only,"So you read Ender's game and you loved it, WARNING! This book is a totaly diffrent genre. While it is a continuation of Ender's game it is written totally diffrent. It is a lot less action-packed but the setting varies a lot more than Ender's game. It does not have that militarisic style of writing where there are certain set objectives. It has a slow begginig and the climax is reached a lot latter on but if you read a book for the plot and not just for the action you will like this book"
3,Speaker for the dead review,"This is only the 2nd book I read from the Ender series but I think I much prefer reading Ender's Game than having to read this again. The book lacks action and drama. Speaker is told with compassion and is a power sequel to Ender's Game but Like I said, I much rather read Ender's Game. IF you wanted to read Xenocide, you got to read this.:-("
5,Great Book,It was a totally different book than I thought it was going to be. It wasn't as action packed as Ender's Game but it was still a book that you can't put down. Orson Scott Card is probably the greatest writer that has ever lived.
4,Worth reading,"What can one say about this book that hasn't been said before? ""Speaker for the Dead"" is fundamentally different from ""Ender's Game."" Those expecting epic space battles and wild technology will instead be confronted with science fiction in which the primary science is anthropology, which is a welcome change of pace. ""Speaker for the Dead"" is by turns gripping, moving, frustrating, interesting, preachy and grossly manipulative. It's not perfect, but what is?Wise readers will stop the Ender series at the end of ""Speaker for the Dead"" and pretend that ""Xenocide"" doesn't exist. Don't say I didn't warn you."
4,Impossibly Good,"At every turn (introducing a new life form, science of time's relativity, continuation of book 1, etc) I was amazed at this author's ability to stimulate.What an amazing ability to generate and relate fantastic ideas this man has. What an ability to to make it seem real!Having gotten dozens and dozens of audio books, and having read 100s and 100s of science fiction works; I recommend you get this immediately.4 stars is for the audible version's use of a less than stellar voice talent that really rubbed me the wrong way; however, they are minor to the overall stirring production."
4,100 Words or Less,"While ""Ender's Game"" was good (see my other review if you're bored), this sequel is outstanding.This novel is the rare occasion when a revisit outshines the original. The characters have much more depth. The story seems emotionally charged. The complexity of the plot is wondrous at times. Yet what really raised the book to a new level was the thought and detail put into alien culture clash.The only drawback was the science part ... meh. A bit too convenient, I thought. But the fiction part is well written indeed."
3,Speaker for the dead,An excellent bridge between the first and third book in the series! A little slow till the last 100 pages but an excellent book that ends well.
4,Very Interesting!,"The second book of the series was definitely a little more mind-bending than the first. This book was good but a bit slow at times and the lengthy descriptions of seemingly non-essential items were off putting. Overall, a good book, but no where near as entertaining as the first."
4,Not really a sequel,This could/should have been a completely different book from Ender's Game. I enjoyed it quite a bit save for all the crying. There was not that much religious over tones and not that much Portuguese as some other reviews led me to believe. The last fifty pages or so dragged on and on costing this book the fifth star rating.I recommend this book as long as you are not expecting more of Ender's Game.
2,This book is for spiritual guidance and NOT for learning facts about nutrition,"If you are interested in how food fits in with your life's purpose, then this book might be for you. This book suggests that you should ""be mindful more not of the body for the body's sake, but of the body that the temple of the living God may be the better channel for manifesting the spritual truths."" Many foods are mentioned regarding their inclusion or exclusion in your diet, but you're expected to take it all on faith since the book does not reference any studies, scientific or otherwise. The book also recommends to avoid microwave ovens for cooking but mentions no reason! Conventional ovens are OK. It also suggests you never eat raw apples. Basically, it's a bunch of advice on how to eat and live without any scientific backing. If you want modern advice backed by science, then try something else like Superfoods RX."
2,says OVERFLOW when inserted into Windows XP,"My CD rom looks exactly like this one, and it will not open on my Windows XP. I do not think this is right to sell this because it is an old piece of software, and you have to get it updated, but how?Thanks,Nancy"
4,would like a 4.5 star,"Easy to read, holds your attention, has many but not all the apparitions. Finished it in 2 days, good enough for a gift."
3,Good Buy,"I bought this toy for my son, he loves all toy story character and he loved this toy. Not educational but it is fun."
2,hard unflexible buzz,"i bought this toy for my son at amazon, it was delivered very soon than what was estimated, but when i recieved it i get disappointed for the small size, unflexible joints, its hard easily broken plastic made,unpractical (need of a table to fix nails to make it fly).when you compare it as regards price, size, and quality to that at disney stores, it is better to get a higher quality character with a cheaper price from disney store."
2,"I wasn't impressed with this mascara, because when ...","I wasn't impressed with this mascara, because when I pulled the brush out of the tube, it was so full I had to clean it on the sides before I could put it on my lashes. Also, I was not used to the larger brush size. I normally use Clinique and their brush size is a lot smaller and easier to apply. I wouldn't buy this product."
3,"I was happy with the product at first, ...","I was happy with the product at first, because it really does build up the volume in eyelashes. After a couple days, though, it began to clump my lashes together. I would continue to use this product, every once in a while."
1,Don't like it at all,"I read this was a really good mascara but I completely disagree! It's really gunky, uncurls my lashes, and clumps like crazy. I regret purchasing this product."
4,"The formula is really nice, goes on smooth, ...","The formula is really nice, goes on smooth, not clumpy. It doesn't really make my lashes much thicker but they look longer. It works as well as my usual brand, which I've used and loved for years. The only thing I didn't like is the brush. It seems to be a little too big and bulky. I find that I get better control with a smaller brush, which is important when you have thin lashes. On the other hand, my sixteen-year-old daughter used this product too and loves everything about it including the brush."
2,It really didn't do much for my lashes ...,"It really didn't do much for my lashes and left rings under my eyes. I wouldn't buy it with my own money, and wouldn't recommend it to other people."
5,Perfect!,"I bought this to replace the POS universal O2 sensor I bought earlier, and boy am I pleased! Perfect fit and application, and HEY! No more ck engine light!"
5,The Best MTG book EVER!,"This is surely the best MTG book in the series. It is dark, mysterious and very compelling. The characters of this book is well designed and the ending is quite unexpected. It also go to details in explaining the construction of Rath's stronghold and the phyraxian's master plan to conquare Dominaria."
1,New version of the review new rating 4 stars,"I've noticed that since the time I've read this book, I've thought about it on more than one occasion. It is odd that a book you read in your early teens haunts you into your young adulthood. After thinking about my initial reaction to the gore and unnecessary violence I guess I would sum this book with the fact that characters are incredibly well fleshed out. I recently finished Heart of Darkness by Joseph Conrad and that piece highlights the darkness in human's soul. The depth and evil in that book are actually brought to life in a book like Nemesis were evil fights evil and you root for all sides because of the sheer twistedness of it."
4,A good book but it needs a little improvment.,"The book's storyline is great, chracters are great , and the overall feeling after reading it is great. But the author portrayed about 4 different charecters. It got very annoying to go from chapter to chapter and switching main charecters. That was the only con but otherwaise I strongly recommend this book."
4,Works for me,I definately liked this one a lot. I did have a hard time relating the storyline to the card set though.
4,The best of the 3,"This book is by far the best of the Mercadian block novels. It has it all love, war, magic. This book is a must read for any magic fan. If found my self always wanting to read on the excitement never stopped. It did have its low points ,and got confusing at times but far less than the other 2."
5,and to think i might of passed it up!,"found this book during mandatory reading at school. awesome, vivid, epic battle scenes, dark romance suited well enough even for the toughest of kids (belbe is so hot!), and sad yet intriguing corruption make this book, and i am completely honest, the greatest piece of work i've ever read. thank you paul b. thompson, you have given us (at least myself) the greatest story ever told. oh, and by the way, the book goes great with metal bands like 'cradle of filth' and '3 inches of blood'!"
2,hard to use,"tried the cookie cutter on several different types of sugar cookie dough (homemade and store bought) but cannot get the cookies to really look like the moose shape. the shapes of the legs and the horns are too intricate and thin so that when the cookie bakes up, it becomes more of a chubby looking pony then a moose."
3,Spike Jones DVD's,From his TV shows. Quite dated but still fun to watch. He was an excellent musician & showman. Almost manic.
3,The BEst of Spike Jones,"This collection of zany musicians is fun to watch and, for older people, a trip down memory lane. It's best listen to one DVD at a time."
2,Spike Jones DVD Dissapoints,"I first heard Spike Jones madness when 10 years old in 1948 on a radio listener's request programme. I was hooked. My bed time was 7.30pm and the show came on at 8.00pm so I would creep into our lounge to hide behind a large armchair, in the hope that a Spike Jones number would be requested. ""Leave the dishes in the sink Ma, The William Tell Overture and Chloe"" were the most often requested numbers. I had a mental picture of his madness but this DVD was not up to that image, sorry Spike Jnr. The Spike Jones TV series was never aired here in New Zealand. One of Spike's comments on how to become a millionaire was printed in a local paper = ""The way to become a millionaire is to make a bigger and better mousetrap than the guy before""."
1,The Best of Spike Jones CD,"Can't believe I liked Spike Jones when I was younger. Acouple of the old classics are Ok, but I'm really sorry I ordered this one."
3,Usually Accurate and Helpful but likely to lead astray,"This is my first time using Clymer as well as working on this bike so take my comments with a grain of salt..As far repair manuals go the only one I've come accross with more errors and crucial bits left out is the Haynes repair manual for my Bimmer.It ranges from little things like the ""6mm"" allen bolts for the camshaft are actually 5mm and forgetting to tell you to completely remove the tensioner before trying to adjust the timing chain to big things like saying that alturnator and the piston needs to be removed to remove the cylinder when this isn't even true."
5,Excellent,I bought the repair manual for my partner and he rates it as excellent. Everything in it you need. Easy to follow instructions and illustrations.
3,Long live the Gurus!,"All you Hoodoo Gurus fans out there, if you can get hold of this CD single, it's well worth the few bucks it'll take. The Gurus always had kick-ass extra tracks on their singles, and this one is no exception. As well as 'The Right Time' off the ""Crank"" album, this one has two tracks unavailable anywhere else. The first is a Brad Shepherd instrumental, 'Road Hog', which is two and a half minutes of glorious surf/biker rock. It really points the way to what Brad would try later on the 'Big Deal' single, the awesome six minutes plus 'Concerto For Choppers'. After 'Road Hog' comes 'Wait For The Sun', a driving slice of Dave Faulkner rock with some seriously pissed-off lyrics. If you can't get this one, do yourselves a favour and get any Hoodoo Gurus singles you can- they are always worth it!"
3,Interesting Drills For Kids and Adults,I recently watched this DVD and found it pretty interesting. I was looking for drills to use for martial arts classes for children and I definitely found some good ones here. There are also some interesting drills for adults. I think this is a good resource to keep on hand for instructors of martial arts.
1,Disappointed,"Just as the other reviewers are saying: These drills were not very good, are very common sense, and looks like it was filmed in the 80's. I recommend you check out endlessmartialartsdrills over this product."
2,"Not so Fun, Not so Exciting","If you've done any martial arts before, this dvd is not worth the money."
5,Hard to find,I've bought this before here & I will buy again . Can not find anyhere locally so its great that I know I can find it here with no problems.
1,They fry to easy,Wnet through two in two weeks both had same problem. They short around the four pin power connection. WAste of time and money.
3,A Fast and Interesting Read,"Just finished reading this book and overall it was good, I would actually give it 3.5 stars if I could. It's concise and can be read in a day. Some entertaining stories and a few nuggets of inspiration.As a downside, readers may find the book more anecdotal and most of the ""Rules"" are common sense. However, the author does state in the introduction that this is not meant to be a ""how-to"" guide, rather like talking to an older mentor. Though the principles are common sense, I do agree with the author that it is the little things like having manners and being yourself that does make the difference.Again, a good book that would make a great gift for a young person starting out in life or an experienced person that needs some grounding."
4,"Fat men can be threatening, according to Bernie","I found this book in the dollar store over the past weekend. I've read through the book and found it enjoyable: Common-sense approaches to business that can be distilled in a few easy lessons. The chapters are short, the points of which are illustrated by vignettes peppered with familiar entertainment industry names. It comes down to this: Be true to yourself, work hard, treat people the way you'd want to be treated, and don't underestimate your enemy. Overall, a worthwhile and entertaining reading experience."
5,So cute!,I love this item and my weiner dog loving sister in law used it to bake with and they turned out awesome!
5,Product as described.,"Fast shipping, product exactly as described...! It made very cute cookies and was easy to use. The tail portion was tricky but overall it worked great."
4,"No, more crackling",Too bad Planet Waves doesn't make these anymore. It's nice to be able to move around with my guitar and not have that annoying crackle and pop with the Roland cable.Very fast service and shipping.Thanks
5,WARRIOR (America's Rock Band) Takes It!,"This CD is great! All the songs have great verses, choruses, hooks that go just right with the lyrics. Strong and compelling, I was impressed with this pop metal, rock n roll style that seems to have progressed to this time of age if 80's rock was allowed to progress to this time. That's how well this CD is! It is dated for now if not twenty years from now. Like Boston, Dokken, Led Zepplin, some things never die... and these guys belong with them! To hear the Gospel advanced in such a way as to make sense to anyone, WARRIOR has succeeded. I'm sure any age would appeciate this CD. Thank you guys for a little breath of fresh air. Look for to the next one."
1,Novelty CD at best,I heard I want a Wallmart Girl and picked this CD up.I wish I hadn't. After just a few listens I grew tired of the blandness. You can get my copy it the used bin if you hurry.
1,"Not too good. Fun for a few moments, but it disappoints.","The album is just lacking something that makes me want to play it a second time.I can recommend trying White Cross or Messiah Prophet is you like this style of music and want Faith based lyrics.I am also partial to Barren Cross, Saint (Judas Priest styled band), and even the first few Bride Cds.If you aren't as worried about the message, Dokken and a few other 80s bands will do.Hoping they grow with the followup as there is potential here (good musicianship and a talented vocalist) but the songs are just really lacking."
2,I tried - but too much cheese for my tastes,"I love 80s metal, but this was just too cheesey for my tastes.There is some decent guitar work in there, but it just comes across as too silly. Again, its a shame as there is some talent in this band.The cover is about the funniest thing I have seen in years too.Also, Don Dokken - how lame and unChristian is it to call someone names because you disagree with review?Shame on you.He didn't like the band. Get over it."
3,"Straight, even-handed analysis of the facts","I found this book at a library sale for 10 cents. And, I was quite impressed with the book. Edwards presents the case for UFOs and he does it based on facts from the Air Force, newspapers, and eye witness accounts. He doesn't speculate as to what the UFOs are - he lets the facts speak for themselves as they are presented. As a result, his material appears to be well founded and his writing style is very readable. Certainly a thought provoking book!"
5,A journey back in time,"The title ""Flying Saucers - Serious business"" is from an Air Force order issued to all Air Force personal on 12/24/1959. This is a very important book. The author Frank Edwards (a hugely popular journalist and radio personality) collected the information in this book until published in 1966. Here are the accounts early in the US Governments cover up with details on how UFO censorship changed over time. Many interesting cases are documented back to the 19th Century including many that are becoming forgotten today.What stands out is how much UFO activity there has been in this century, especially since the 1940s. Some major cases today (Roswell and Kecksberg) are only mentioned in passing while other nearly forgotten cases are detailed. This book is a UFO research missing link because it was written so much closer in time to the major UFO events from the 1940s to the 1960s by a man that spent much of his life collecting the evidence."
4,Flying Saucers - Here and Now!,"Author wrote this book following his ""Flying Saucers - Serious Business"" stating new evidence and new photographs, that is, cases that occurred during 1966 and 1967. The attempt is to let the cases speak for themselves. I have read most if not all of his books, and this is one to add to those one collection. Mr. Frank Edwards' book all let me with the impression to continue our search for the evidence and facts in each one of his cases, whether it be related to Flying Saucers or strange people or worlds. The truth is out there!"
3,Jacket was quite torn,"I ordered this book because it was described as being in very good condition. The book was in good condition, but I was quite disappointed that the jacket was pretty torn, and I will not be able to display it on my library shelf."
4,helpful,"This book is helpful to librarians who use picture books with students. I did find that some of the books were below level for the grade suggested, and some students complained about having ""babyish"" books read to the class. If I feel the books are below interest, or other level, I think of ways to make them more interesting. Of course, this defeats the purpose of having a lesson plan book divided by grade level, but it is what must sometimes be done. Some of the lessons require too much prep, but others are easy to implement. Although you will not use each lesson included, you will use enough to cover the cost of the book."
5,Useful!,I bought this book for my Dad who was interesting in building a spinning wheel. The wheel he made is beautiful and works wonderfully!
5,An imaginative and inspiring book on decorating with kilims.,"I found this book to be full of good ideas on how to decorate with kilims. There are many color illustrations of kilims used as wall hangings, tablecloths, etc., as well floor coverings, and detailed descriptions of how to hang and mount kilims. Also, there are quite a few good illustrations showing how easily kilims can complement other types of collectible textiles, folk art, and many styles of furniture from modern to antique. There are other books that give more information about buying, selling and value of kilims. This book is mainly for decorating purposes."
4,Nice album,"Nice album overall, Great interpretation of Bohemian Rhapsody by Bruce Dickinson(Iron Maiden's singer), making it a memorable version."
1,CROSSOVER DOES NOT WORK,"Some interesting tracks but this is a Caballe album and should be reviewed as such. Fans of other artists should look at their artists' own releases and not this one. Caballe is a great operatic soprano but the crossover does not work for me. The classical operatic training does not do justice to the songs which require an altogether different voice. Finally, the mixing is very poor. Clearly the tracks are recorded at different times, studios and with different equipment. This makes it difficult to balance the songs from an audio quality point of view."
3,Montserrat does it again!,"I haven't heard the whole cd. But I believe Montserrat to be one of the greatest sopranos ever. She certainly has great vocal beauty, power, and class. And she has probably the most unique voice in all of opera. Nearly every recording that has her voice on it is great.Bruce Dickinson does no justice to bohemian rhapsody in the duet . Bruce Dickinson is clearly one of the worst vocalists ever to curse the planet. I do like the band iron maiden but Bruce Dickinson just isn't even close to the greatness of Freddy Mercury."
3,Good not Great,"I like this mascara because it does not smudge easily (even though I tend to rub my eyes a bit throughout the day). However, WAY too much mascara gets trapped on the brush and I have to wipe it off 3 or 4 times before using it. Otherwise it just globs on and clumps your lashes."
3,Not as good as Almay,"I bought this mascara because I wanted to try something new and because of good reviews I read on Amazon, but after I tried it, I didn't notice any difference from other mascaras I used, so I am definitely going back to the previous mascara I used Almay Waterproof. It was much better, made my lashes longer and thicker and I could clean it more easily with Neutrogena waterproof make up remover. This mascara is just not special at all to me. I had better ones, so would not buy it again, just tried once."
1,i think this was a fake loreal?,"do they even make fake loreal mascara? the printing on the cardboard looked really cheap, and the brush, and tube did not seem up to standards."
5,Love this mascara!,"Mascara is an essential part of my makeup routine, and after many years of searching for the best one, this is it. It maximizes my lashes with beautiful, natural results. The applicator brush is perfect to get every lash; the consistency of the mascara is never thin, but smoothly substantial. I've used this mascara for many years, occasionally trying others but I've always returned to this specific one. I love it!"
2,not as described beware,"The speaker mic does not come with a volume control or a scan button,as described. Spend the extra money for model kmc 19 compatable with the protalk series, but not with this company."
1,terrible,"I first put in a 20 oz CO2 tank and it didn't fit. i tried using a 10 oz and it didn't fit. I finally got an old 9 oz tank to fit. I thought,""i can live with this,"" but then after a few matches the trigger guard broke. it wasn't that big of deal. but then after the next match i could hear the co2 leaking. I took it apart and couldn't find the problem. I now have to buy a new gun. I gave it a flat F"
3,"Good for holding all the quarters [1999 - 2008], but ..","Good for holding all the quarters [1999 - 2008], but fitting the quarters in their slots is *very* hard. I would still give this item 3 stars, since it does a good job of providing one comprehensive folder for all the state quarters [from both D and P mints]"
4,Collector's Essential Case,"This case will store your quarters from various years. Though the quarters are a bit tough to fit in the spaces at first, it needs to be this way so they will not fall out over time. I would recommend this case to any quarter collector who is interested in expanding his or her collection."
1,misrepresented,"I expected, as the cover indicates, 1999 to 2008. Open the book and it only has slots for 2002 to 2007! Totally misrepresented! Expected to give my grandchildren a total collection, to the end of 2006, with room for more. Not going to happen! Don't buy it!"
4,It does the job!,"It does the job and for the price, you really can't beat that. I had no problems putting the coins in their slots and no misprints. Yes, once the coins are in their slots, the backing will protrude to the shape of the coins rather than a smooth back. I myself didn't have any problem with that. It gives it character. I think that is meant so that you can push the coins out with ease if you should have a need to so. Either way, it satisfies my needs and that is to hold the coins in an organized fashion rather than sit in a jar or plastic zip lock bags. Thanks!"
3,Fifty State(District of Columbia and Territorial Commemorative,It's a good way to save the quarter collection-but for the price-I didn't like it that the quarter shape shows through on the back side. I'll probably order more because I'm collecting the quarters for my grandchildren.
5,I own several and will keep buying them!,"Whitman coin folders are a cheap, easy, and educational way to sort your coin collection. They are always of good quality and easily display your coins as well as information about them. I own several Whitman coin folders and I will keep buying more!"
2,Wouldn't recommend for young children,"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my 6 yr. old son. When he started learning about money last year in school, he was fascinated with the difference in each quarter and I thought this would be a great way for him to start a collection. Unfortunately, for the price, you get what you paid for on this one. The book in itself is sturdy but the slots to insert the coins is rather flimsy and you can see the imprint pushing through the cover when the book is closed. I found a much nicer book with a map of the United States at a bookstore for a dollar more than this one. I'd suggest looking for alternatives if you're buying this for children."
4,nice and sturdy,"very nice and sturdy booklet for collecting both ""P"" and ""D"" new fifty state quarters. a nice touch would have been if you could see both sides of quarters but it probably wouldn't have been as sturdy. holds quarters snugly.only little complaint was the state names are in black print (under each quarter holding pocket) on blue background paper which is a little hard to read."
3,Difficult to get quarters to stay in the cutout spots,It's okay but wish the quarters would fit into all the slots the way they work for a few! Not very high quality construction of the folder.
2,The coins don't fit in the holes,"This is a coin book issued for collecting and organizing the state quarters. The look and feel book is very nice but the quarters don't fit, at least most of the time. I have three of my nine grandkids collectiong coins and they want to put their coins into their book. It is very frustrating for a nine year old to push with all his might and the coins is still loose.It seemed to help when I put the book over a cushioned surface. But I still think the die cutters could be adjusted or maintained a little better."
2,"state quarter book, good if you want no frills and are extremely gentle","i bought this because i needed somewhere to put the state quarters i had acquired and this seemed like it would fit the bill. it was relatively inexpensive and held D and P mints plus the U.s. Territories which was pretty handy. But that was all that was good about it, i struggled getting the quarters to fit and when i did get them in usually the backing ripped out and therefore the quarter fell out. i had this happen numerous times and no matter how hard (or how gently) i tried, only a few would fit and what didnt fit ripped the cheap paper backing. I could have made a better folder out of a piece of cardboard, and it probably would've been 10 times sturdier. Spend your money elsewhere, its not worth the money."
3,difficult to put coins in slots,"I bought the H.E. Harris Official U.S. Mint 50 State Quarters collectors book. It has a nice appearance, but it is difficult to put the coins in the holes provided. I can't seem to do it. Is there a simple way to do this."
3,Made in China :(,"This three star review would be five stars, except this coin book is made in China.It is sad we have to manufacture a US coin holder in China."
1,Poor Quality,The binding on the book has holes in it and the back and front covers are warped. I am going to return this item and ask for a refund.
3,Nice for the casual collector,"This is a nice keepsake for those who casually collect quarters. If you are serious about your collection, I recommend the ""album"" version of this product by Whitman."
3,Nice but things to take note of,"This is a nice coin book but I just want to note two things interested buyers should be aware of: (1) When you push in the coins, it can leave coin-shaped protrusions on the other side of the leather covering, and (2) At least on my copy of the book there's a typo for South Carolina. For each state, there is a slot for D and a slot for P minted coins, and there is a label underneath (e.g., ""California-D"" and ""California-P""). On my copy, ""South Carolina-P"" is printed twice, instead of one for South Carolina-D."
3,"For mature coin collectors, not chldren","This coin folder was made in somber dark colors that lend themselves to serious coin collectors, not to children. I bought this folder for my daughter and have been very disappointed in the difficulty to get coins in using smaller fingers and children's muscle power. Also, after only two openings and closings, the glue started to release, letting the cardboard 'pages' separate. For an ongoing collection of quarters (many of which have yet to be minted and released), I foresee this being in pieces long before my daughters 'collection' is complete. If you are looking for something for your child to use, keep looking. This is not what you want or need."
2,Not a good folder,"I was very dissapointed with how cheaply made this folder is. The holes for the coins are much to small, and when you apply pressure to insert the coins, you end up tearing through the folder. The Whitman folders I purchased years ago are much better than these. I suggest you look for other coin folders. The printing on the cover looks very cheap and is not up to the old Whitman standards either."
2,Coins do not fit,The concept of having both the P & D mints in one book is great. My biggest issue is that the slots are too small for the quarters. Trying to jam them into the slots left my fingers in pain. I ended up taping the quarters down while I look for a replacement.
3,Nice Coin folder but ...,Nice Coin folder but not made for silver and proof editions.I would not buy it if I would know this.Openings are too small.Fit only regular commemorative quarter from Denver or Philly mint.
4,For folks who want both sets of State Quarters only,"This booklet holds both sets ""D"" and ""P"" quarters, which is fine if you want to simply house both sets, although, once you have the coins in place, you can't tell if they are from Denver or Philly. Regardless, I bought one for each of my kids."
4,sturdy/well made,"This coin album works great. The coins are a little difficult to get in the slots however, that means they will not easily come out. I did a collection for my son and plan on making one for my neice and nephew. It is a great thing to keep and for children to work on collecting each coin. I love that it has a spot for each mint."
1,Not useful for my purposes,"The back cover was somewhat dented, and it did not have a place for all of the quarters--only thoseproduced prior to 1006"
5,my husband loves it,"My husband has been collecting the state quarters and needed a place to display them. He was very happy with this, and wants another!"
4,Excellent value,"This product is excellent for the price. A friend bought another folder and after they placed all the coins most fell out. This folder keeps the coins in place. The only problem I found was that South Carolina is titled ""P"" on both the ""D"" and ""P"" lines."
4,As described.,"The product is as described.Not very high quality , but it does the job.The only reason for 4 star and 5 is the quality."
1,Fifty State Quarter Folder $7.99,"This is the worst item I have bought from you guys. The slots are too small and I have to use a hammer to make sure they stay put. Some of the quarters went all the way to the other side and this was without using the hammer, this messed up the look of my nice looking book. I should have only bought one instead of two at the same time so that I would have only lost half the amount of my money. I would not recommend this item to anyone. I am very disappointed with these items."
4,Nice and neat folder,"This isn't fancy, but it works quite well for holding our collection. It has places for quarters from the Philadelphia mint as well as the Denver mint. Sure makes you pay a bit more attention to your change!"
4,What A Life!!,"Leonard Bernstein was always creating something. He worked with and knew many people. He may have had problems but those are nothing compared to his achievements. This biography starts with his birth straight through to his death. I read in sequence up until his graduation from Harvard and then I skipped around. I have very little of a music background andbecause I became little bored, I found it more interesting to skip to the background of West Side Story, On the Town , the Black Panther party etc. I read everthing but not in sequence. After I finished this biography, I felt I really knew Bernstein and I liked him. I would highly recommend this biography. Bernstein's story is fascinating."
4,A balanced view of the myth and the man,"If you are interested in Bernstein, this is the biography to read. It neither raises him up too high nor tears him apart. Much of it deals with Bernstein's inner turmoil and how that impacted his relationships. Bernstein's humanity comes through very strongly. An enjoyable read, good pictures too."
1,"Sorry, doesn't look like it's for me...","I guess this is a really technical look at the composer's life without much backstage drama, because in leafing through the index, there's no mention of Carol Lawrence, Chita Rivera or Larry Kert, the famous cast members of the original production of ""West Side Story."" A short chapter is devoted to the musical, but without comments either from or on its legendary cast? Bizarre.Call me shallow, but I don't want to read something that dry."
4,Weather Wise,"If you know a child, or even an adult, who wants to get wise about weather than here's the book for you. A comprehensive and pictorial start for brewing meteorologists or just any lover of weather."
1,This would've been good material for MST3K!,"William Shatner has to support his life of luxury. Horses, girlfriends. He plays a Presidential candidate in this one. Although I can't say his performance has changed through the years; it was his over acting that makes this so entertaining. The ending where he battles the Jeff Speakman ""good guy"" character makes this worth it. Seeing Shatner jump out of a helicopter was like somthing out of his Captain Kirk era. Mystery Science Theater 3000 would have a field day with this one! The former program could be revived with all of Shatner's bad films. Now if only he would sell the rights........"
1,One star is too generous.,"Aiden Carvill (no relation to James, and portrayed by William Shatner) is a Senate candidate who is also the kingpin in a conspiracy of right-wing militias to take over the country. Fortunately, he hires a martial arts expert, former Navy SEAL, and survivor from the explosion of the planet Krypton, whose wife used to drive in demolition derbies, as an aide. When the FBI gets the aide to check on some incriminating info on his boss, he is caught, and the militias make the mistake of going after Superman and his family. The movie goes downhill from there, ending in the hero committing first degree murder. The other members of the conspiracy survive, but apparently are too intimidated by this man to take further action. The bad guy's influence in the Justice Department and the federal judiciary is similarly intimidated. The ghost of Ed Wood may have been involved, but is not mentioned in the credits."
1,A great story... but who's?,"Such a socially important event treated so opportunistically by the author. Full of hearsay and unsupported speculation. But then when there are no witnesses you can claim just about anything. And Wansell does.When I read sentences like, ""....and they may have...."" or ""...then it is likely that he...."" I suspect that it could be just a bit of imagination. And that is exactly what this garbage is.West committed suicide (??) before giving evidence in a court of law. Everything that he said before his death is questioned along with the evidence of his wife. And somehow Wansell is privy to all the facts.No doubt he will make a fortune with this rubbish. What is 560 pages could have been condensed to 100 with all the embellishment taken out. Do yourself a favour and research the facts from newspapers or other secondary sources."
2,wild speculation,"I expected more from this book so I was bound to be disappointed. I have read other books about these monsters, but I expected this book to have something different as the author had access to family and documents. There is no new information or insights. The book is full of; he might have done this, or this or this may have happened, or maybe even this happened.. The author seems to have no idea and is speculating at best. It is quite easy to think up different senarios, but this does not mean they are an accurate representation of what actually occurred."
3,Kids liked the Barney Movie,Your kids will probably like having Barney and Santa Claus in the same movie. If you don't like Barney then don't buy this movie :-).
4,Barneys night before Christmas,"My Grand daughter started liking Barney lately, so I thought I buy her this dvd she watches it all the time."
3,A great video but low quality sound,"I bought this movie for my son, who is one of Barney's avid fans. The story and songs are a great Christmas entertainment for children. I was however disappointed with the quality of sound... it keeps fluctuating and becomes very irritating after a few minutes. Amazon promptly replaced it for me, but the new copy was also faulty. Do not buy this Barney video... not worth the effort and money..."
5,One of the best books ever,"The Red horse is more an experience than a book. In reading it I felt inside the events of the second world war as if I was actually there.The author lived the events he narrates in first person, or listened carefully to other people's experiences, read documents, letters, newspapers in order for the story to be as close as possible to the real events.I once attended a conference organized for students in which Corti was speaking. The center of his speech has been the explanation of his love for truth as an evangelical mission.He said he took days reading letters just to be sure of how a node of a wagon was made in order to write it. Every single line on the book is checked several times for the sake of truth. It is classified as a novel, but it could actually be taken as historical book.Its reading makes you wiser."
3,Not one of my favorite books,I read a lot and sometimes it is difficult to rate books I have read as they are sometimes sending a message I don't like and therefore I condemn them and possibly others will feel differently.
5,EllieandBoo,"I love reading about the Amish and Mennonite people and this book is a wonderful read. Dorcus Smucker takes each chapter of her book and writes about family, friends, home, etc. Reading this book makes me wish I could live in the country."
4,"Ordinary Days, by Dorcas Smucker",Humerous stories and touching tales of everyday family life. I'm not finished but enjoyable read. Purchased on recommendation from fellow blogger.
5,Two of my favorites!,The workout is fast paced and has a great deal of variety. I have done it over 50 times and I'm still not bored with it. I would NOT recommend these tapes for your first step experience. There is little (to no) instruction given. You just jump right into an advanced step class.Gay is fun and energetic while remaining down to earth. No phoney-baloney peppiness from her! She is one of the best callers that I have ever seen and really seems to love what she is doing.I can't even loan these to my friends. I use it at least once a week.
4,Have you been to Delphi?,"Delphi is the place of encounter with truth. It is both a specific place with its own history and customs, and a general metaphor for all such places, inner and outer, at that time and in our time. Delphi is rediscovered wherever human beings question intently and receive - from a helpful person, from inner resources, from on high - insights that suggest not just an immediate solution but a sense of the path ahead, of a destiny that invites or commands the inquirer to be all he can.The question of what Delphi might mean for us now remains. This book probes for that answer, and each reader will ultimately decide the question privately."
5,The riddles of Delphi,"The oracle of Delphi,is all about the pythia or oracle at Delphi.It describes what Socrates,Plato,Aristoteles,Demistones and many other intellectuals,how and what the oracle wrote and predicted.The Oracle sat on a tripod in the inner sanctum of the temple.The riddles are very interesting in analizing them.There are many stories about the warriors of Sparta.Many remains have been excavated in Delphi at the Temple,however of all the writings only one has survived.""Know Thyself"".By knowing thyself we go into depth of what who and how we are as a person.I feel that if you believe in these things,reading the oracle's response is a vey insight of the inner person that we are.My feeling about the response of the pythia is that she was in a trance caused by sulfur fumes caused by a sysmic fault.The answers were given to her by the intellectuals and priests that were at the Temple.Plato was one of them."
1,"Poorly Organized, Look for a similar and better book by DDC","There is no Index or Table of Contents. The book is poorly organized alphabetically by the title of the subject. If you refer to the subject by a different title you have to go through the book page by page until you find your subject. For example ""Attachments"" is in the ""E"" group. It's a time-waster. It's a small book only 5.5 X 8.5 inches.DDC has put out similar books in the past, I have been using a book by Diana Rain of the DDC Visual Reference Basics series for Outlook 98. It is far more complete,better organized, has better graphics and is spiral bound, which is more convenient. I should've waited for DDC to come out with their Outlook 2002 book.That's my advice, skip Outlook 2002 From A to Z, and watch for DDC's Outlook 2002"
5,Recommended,"Like many customers here, I'm a research hound. After the NYTimes reviewed fireplace DVDs, I became curious and went through the reviews here on Amazon.This DVD was among the best-rated on Amazon and NYT's recommendation. It is also mine (without having bought or watched others).When - in an unusual cool winter in Florida and capped chimney in our house - you have the DVD running and keep thinking at times that the living room should warm up now because of the fire, you know your brain has been fooled. In this case, a good thing. It won't replace the sensory experiences of a real fireplace, but it will come very close, for very little money."
4,"Pretty nice, but not perfect","Overall the product was nice with the options of natural sounds as well as music. I have seen a little better options for fires than this, but the many choices should have you find one or two that you may like the best. They did try hard at finding some good serene fires and although some appear unreal, it is still very good. I prefer more natural looking fires myself, but if I had known this, I may have passed it up for another purchase. Overall, it is not bad and I do like it so I give it a four stars for overall nice program, but minus one star as the different fires were not what I had anticipated being that they looked unnatural."
1,Did not work for me,I had difficulty getting this DVD to work for me. After selecting video scene and audio it would cycle back to the beginning menu almost all the time. It did work about 5% of the time. My DVD player is less than 3 years old so I don't think that was the problem. I ordered a new fireplace video from a different maker and it works flawlessly. I played around with this flawed DVD for about two hours until I realized it was not going to work for me. I was frustrated and disappointed with this purchase.
2,Tops of flames cut off,"I have no idea why the tops of the flames are cut off... if not the flames, what are people who buy this product interested in? To make matters worse, it didn't fill up my widescreen television vertically - the result is black bars across the top and bottom, with the viewer thinking, ""those flames stop, but there's still room on the tv???""another nitpick - what does ""shot in HD"" mean for a standard definition DVD? maybe i'm ill informed about the benefits of ""shooting in HD,"" but as far as i can tell, it's like advertising that the price is accurate to 10 decimal places... who cares? $10.49 is $10.49 at 2 decimal places or 10.otherwise, it is what it's advertised to be - a fire on DVD."
5,Very festive for the holidays,"The playlist feature is nice, and I love the fact that there's a separate holiday scene that you can choose to use during the fall and winter months. The quality is as good as I would expect from a regular DVD (as opposed to HD/Blu-Ray), and I'm glad I was able to buy a gift that was made in the United States."
5,"The best use of a large TV, while not actually watching TV","I've thoroughly enjoyed playing the Ambient Fire DVD as background while doing other things. Having a nice fire going while reading a book, relaxing with a loved one, taking a nap on a rainy day, or any other time you want to hear the crackles and pops of a fire. Having the choice of 8 different types of fireplace, including a campfire, really expands the use of this DVD. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a way to utilize their TV while not actually watching TV."
4,Does what it should,"Bought it to simulate fire on my 42"" LCD and works great.I converted the video of my favorite fireplace (there are many) to a .mpg file read by my hard disk recorder, for an instant and more silent play than from DVD.The picture quality is great, sound is amazing. Too bad there is no HD version.The ""fire"" effect works just perfectly : you really ""feel"" like being seated in front of a real fire, and the relaxing and warming effect is almost physical.Last advantage : This chumney is 0 maintenance and occupies no room, which is a real advantage over real ones ;-)"
5,Best on the market,"In the first place, embience-creating DVDs are hard to find at the retail level. Those that are available are one-trick ponies, giving you one, maybe two options. Others that I've tried are poorly done, as well. That's what I love about this one. If you want a fire-place scene, this one is the best. It has many fire-place options to choose from, and they are well done. There's even one for Christmas. You also have an option to have sound, which can be several types of music (even Christmas) or just fire-crackling sounds, which sounds very real. We love this DVD!"
4,You'll really enjoy the ambiance...,"This is not the absolute perfect fireplace DVD, but I have no regrets about purchasing it. You'll love the options available (different fireplaces and sounds, etc) and the picture is great. My only wish is that each fire was shown from beginning to end, from initial roaring flames down to the dying embers, which is the only reason I didn't give 5 stars. I have watched it dozens of times, and I especially enjoy reading in front of it. PLEASANT, RELAXING AND REALISTIC... RECOMMENDED!"
3,Good for what it is.,"While I knew going in that the claim ""filmed in HD"" meant nothing (would require Blu-ray or HDDVD disc and player), I was surprised at the only average resolution. That being said, everyone who has been to my place while this DVD played, really enjoyed it and wanted to know where I got it. It fulfills it's role as a background and since I have no comparisons to other similar products, performs adequately."
3,"It's a fire DVD, that's for sure...","It's hard to rate this video, because really it's what you ask for-- a fireplace on video. However I was hoping for a higher quality video, not something that looks like it was shot with some regular home video camera. Despite that, the fire sounds are great and the ""Max Relax"" music is very soothing and I actually fell asleep listening to it! The ""Yultide"" music is ok, but I played my own music during our Christmas party. Overall it's a good video, despite the quality of the footage itself."
2,Too fast.....,"I do not know why no one has mentions that the fires are burning at a faster than normal rate - I did not find it at all relaxing, and am very disappointed in the DVD. Even the music seems to be sped up - as though the whole DVD was recorded at 2x speed. I playeed it on my computer and DVD player - both produced the same results. Any one else experience this?"
5,AWESOME Virtual Fireplace DVD,I absolutely LOVE this DVD. The fires are realistic and very soothing. It gives you many options for different fire scenes plus music or just the fire crackle sound. I play this DVD almost every night and sometimes during the day. It creates a very relaxed and soothing environment. A must buy for sure! :-)
4,It's okay.,"Not a terrible DVD, but I still find myself going back to my old original fireplace DVD. More a matter of personal preference than an issue of quality."
3,Its nice,I purchased this for christmas to hang the stockings on the entertainment center with the fire playing on TV. It did the job. The fire was much too blown out and bright which took away from the detail of the flames.
2,Not even close to HD video,"This says ""Shot in HD"" as if it was actually HD, its not. Its just ""Shot in"". Which means the video on the disc is of dissapointing quality if you own an HD capable TV. Not only that but the fireplace scene selection is bad, and there aren't enough long-play scenes to make this disk worthwhile IMO. I could do without things like a campfire scene, and an ugly candle scene. Its not a big deal to buy a candle and light it so I'm not sure what the benefit of seeing a candle on a TV for ten minutes is...Its a decent product, but, it could be better. With Blu-Ray just around the corner I would wait for a product supporting that format."
3,I Have Created The Most Trivial Thing In The World,"A fire is an elemental, and therefore trivial, thing.A video of a fire is still more trivial.Selling that same video raises the triviality by another factor.Having a web page devoted to the selling of a video of a fire is triviality to the fourth power.Now, I used a link on another site to get to this page: triviality to the fifth.I noted that people have ACTUALLY TAKEN THE TIME TO REVIEW VIDEO FIRE. T6.Bemused by seeing the comments, I decided to leave a comment commenting on the triviality of commenting on a video of fire. Thus achieving triviality in the seventh dimension.I believe that these words are, for the moment, the least relevant entities in the universe. I am humbled and exalted at once."
4,Not so sad but...,"Ok. Why did the let ""So Why So Sad"" become the first single? It's the one that's least good. Intravenus Agnostic on the other hand is terrific. It look's like they are going a bit comersial by letting ""So.."" become the first single, to ge people to buy the record, but all the other songs are really good, so I forgive them.Manics are political, you hear it in there lyrics, and you hear it in interviws, amd that's the best about them. The are one of the fue bands that haven't abandonned there oppinion. Stand up for it guys."
3,less than I expected,"For an ostensibly political band, MSP didn't seem to have much meaningful to say. Their political points seem simplistic and are stated with something less than depth and intelligence. Their views are their views -- this is not a critique of their politics. But I've heard their political points made much more convincingly on other discs. I guess Nicky Wire just isn't the thinker that Richey Edwards was.As far as the tunes go, I've heard better and worse. Some songs are interestingly crafted and really quite attractive; others shouldn't have been released. I thought the disc quite uneven, sometimes trying.This set seems a sort of step backwards for an important band. It makes me wonder if they didn't lose something more than a band member when Richey went away -- or at least that MSP might have now put a little too much distance between themselves and that formative time to attempt a ""return to their roots"", as this album is sometimes billed."
4,Back To Form,"This is a welcome return to form after the rather dissapointing 'This is my Truth...'. There's plenty of everything on this album, from the odd balled to real heavy rock. Sadly though, this is the only Manics album where I actually skip tracks. Both 'Wattsville Blues' and 'Let Robeson Sing' I find unlistenable. I also can't relate to the lyrics as much as previous albums, but the music more than makes up for this."
1,a ripoff,This item appears to have been produced on a home PC. This is a remix from some other source and is a terrible redub. It will not play on one of my blu-ray players and frequently drops out on my other one
1,The Music of the Music is Boring,"What a waste of cold hard cash. The album opens up with an infusion of ""not of this world"" sounds...and an infectious groove...but don't be fooled. Unfortunately for the listener...as the singer chimes in...""the Music"" becomes as annoying and agonizing as listening to your grandma belch and wease during an 18-hour car ride to Florida. Rolling Stones (for whatever reason) praised this album...apparently their reviewer also enjoys long drives to FL to drop off Granny.As the album continues...the vocal stylings started to remind me of the glory days of the mid-80's...and bands like Slaughter and the Bulletboys. Next the listener experiences a sense of deja-vu when you start to realize that each drum track sounds exactly the same. This similarity turns to boredom. Trust me...wait until you see this sucker in a cut-out bin at a local used record store...that's where mine is headed. The Music should take their own advice...and take the long road...and walk it."
3,Okey-Dokey...,"I've been here before...and I'm not ready to go back yet.Boy I've noticed a whole bunch of 5 star reviews with astonished listeners all just blown away... ... I hear a whole bunch of 6 minute jam sessions with mediocre musicianship and boring cliché rock tricks. Hey, the old tricks are the best tricks when it comes to Rock and Roll, and nobody loves them more than me (The Helicopters, Fu Manchu, Monster Magnet or Nebula) I love that stuff, it's near and dear to my rusty old heart, but this is something entirely different in that it's not played particularly well and not very smart in it's choice of ""tricks"" Everybody's gonna use them, hell I demand it in a rock album...but these songs lack any real ingenuity to the point where it's hard for me to stay focused on the music I tend to stop listening to the music and start doing essentially anything else, not a good sign. Good luck and buyer beware. (My copy is for sale)"
5,saw them live....THEY ROCK,my husband called them a rock band that grew up going to raves...i totally agree. saw them open for Coldplay in Pgh and they were amazing. these guys have got it.
3,One Of The Few Good New Bands I've Heard This Year,"There's nothing incredibly original about The Music. But they brought me back to the glory days of Fastway and Great White like no other new band has. Plus, this disc (at the time of this writing) is very affordable. Good job, blokes."
4,What a great surprise.,"At bought this cd because I had read a few reviews of it and some of them compared these guys to Chemical Brothers. I thought to myself, how can I rock band sound like the Brothers? Well I bought the CD and found out. With points that are totally filled with noise and massive crescendos they are like a rock out version of the chemical brothers. They have a great lead singer and at times remind me of a mix between Blind Melon and Jane's Addiction with some electronics thrown in. Definetely a good one to check out."
2,Average,"This album is not as great as the other reviewers have made it out to be. The musicians are talented and the music is creative, but after the first time you listen to the CD all the way through, it gets old really fast. There isn't a single track on the album that is really ""memorable."" There are some catchy bass and guitar patterns, but overall the album isn't anything to get excited over."
5,AMAZING.,"Quite simply the best and most exciting albums, by a new artist, since Oasis' ""Definitely Maybe"". I got it 6 days ago, and it has not left my CD player. Just unbelivable."
1,It's wonderful for maybe a month if you are lucky!,"I bought this blanket in November. I loved it. It was pink. It was so nice & soft & warm. At about 4 weeks it started blinking E3. You have to turn it off & hope it will come back on in a while. Then within a week it starts blinking E4. Then it never works again. Costumer service is real nice. You send it back at your own expense and they send you a new one. Well my third one broke, I'm not paying to send it back. I emailed them to refund my money. Hope they do. Their product is defective. DO NOT BUY IT!!"
1,Do not buy this product in any size,"I bought this blanket in a full size this winter...It worked fine for one week. Then the control mechanism failed...it froze up, buttons stuck. I contacted the maker of the blanket, and they offered to replace it for me....the one they sent me lasted 3 weeks...then the same problem began again. I email the maker and told them that the problem had occurred with this blanket...I have yet to hear back from them $136.00 down the drain. Don't buy it..."
1,American-made junk,"This product failed to work, straight out of the package. A huge disappointment. Save your money and buy a regular blanket --- from someone else."
1,SERIOUS TARD MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!,"Why do people like this movie????I can'tunderstand the affinity!!!!!!!It's so stupid andpredictable,if you're over 12 you know he's going to end upwith the girl,kenny out of jail and him off the big badhabit.The ironic part is,the movie appeals topot-heads and druggies,but it actuallysubtly insults them by denouncing marijuana."
3,half baked,it is a nice movie but thn who knws it could had been better a frnd of mine suggested it to m but i wont recomend any 1 to buy it u can only view this movie only once
3,3 1/2 STARS NOT CHAPPELLE'S BEST WORK ! STILL FUNNY!,"I did not see this movie until recently,so it is not an ""old friend"" like ""Up In Smoke"" is to me. There are some funny moments and the cast is very good for this type of picture,but Chappele's show is funnier than this movie. If your a stoner fan(like me) than you already have this in your collection."
3,HALF BAKED,"this is a STONER classic this is one of the first DVD's I ever owner. starring Dave Chappelle, Jim Breuer, and others this movie is a must have for any pot-head. it is a story of the trials and tribulations of 4 NYC roomates as they smoke and sell marijuana to raise bail-money to get they're friend kenny out of jail. Very funny, and a definate must have."
4,Great Movie,"This movie was terrific but I have to agree with the other reviewer who said that the features weren't all that great. If you're a Half Baked fan, you might want the full DVD, but if you're just someone, like me, who likes the movie then no need for the top notch edition."
4,Stoner movie at it's finnest,"This is by no means, a serious movie, nor it intends to be. If you understand this, you will enjoy this movie. Very pleasent to watch, as the colors and sounds are enjoyable, specially ""on weed"". Might give you a slight case of the munchies."
5,one of the greats,"thounght it was one of the best stoner films ive ever seen!they were actually hardcore tokers, made me laugh till i couldnt breath! EXELENT"
5,Silly,"if you take this movie for what it is, enjoy it in the humourous manner of which it was intended, you'll laugh the whole way through it.... Favorite lines include:""and some Funyuns man""""if he aint back in an hour, I'm calling Dominos""""fish, fish... I aint no fish""""no window love for you""Great movie.... not good for young kids, but your older teens will laugh til they cry.... remember it is JUST A MOVIE... dont try this at home!"
5,They Killed Killer B!,"If you want a funny stoner movie hands down this is it. Right up there with ""Up in Smokes"" Dave Chappelle will have you on the ground laughing."
4,Half Baked for a Reason,"First things first: if you have never smoked pot before, this movie, like most other of the stoner variety, will probably a)make no sense to you, and b)make you say, ""I will NEVER EVER try pot!"" If you have smoked pot, you will probably say, ""Dude..."" and then collapse into a fit of giggles. I'm sure there are people from the first group who will be amused, and people from the second who won't, but I've found that for the most part, it divides like that.Maybe this was a joke that went over the heads of some reviewers, but the reason that the plot is truly half baked is that it's a stoner movie. I've noticed that stoner movies tend to start nowhere and end nowhere, and this one's no exception. It expertly replicates that aspect of the experience of being stoned. Though I suppose I could be reading too much into the lack of actual plot. I know that I can't handle complex plot when I'm stoned, though, and this is one of the best movies to watch stoned, ever."
4,It is a crime to watch this movie sober.,"As a former marijuana smoker I liked this movie a lot. It was so funny to me cause it was a movie for people who smoke Marijuana. If you don't smoke Marijuana don't watch the movie, you probably won't get half the jokes but if you do this will soon become the buddha of your TV!"
5,Half Baked Rocks,"This movie is worth rewinding and watching again. Every Sunday at 4:20, I get comfortable on the couch while roasting one. Once in the proper mind set I pop in the tape and enjoy one the best comedies of the decade."
5,Groovy man,"Before I saw this movie I thought it was going to be a short pointless movie and it was neither! I found this movie to be totally funny. Each actor is beyond funny and the plot of trying to get their friend Kenny out of jail makes the movie even better. Every time i watch it, the movie gets better and better"
4,if you tried you know...,I have seen this movie 10 times or more. This is one funny movie if you know what cannabis is all about. and then again there are people that will say it's stupid. If you like hanging out with your friends and having fun you will like this movie. it is a simple movie and fun to watch.
4,very funny,this is one of the funniest movies i've ever seen. i hope a special edition comes out soon. there is a good chance because it has become very popular.
3,Hmmmmmm....,"Potheads!Hippies! 'Its all about the weed yo!' LOL...This movies alright, Its all about these pothead guys that try to earn money to bail their friend outta jail by selling weed....Its pretty funny 2!"
2,Half Rated!!!,"Half-Baked, a film about a couple of buddies who sit around all day and do drugs, is not only not worth while to watch, but it's filled with bad acting and a poor script with characters that don't seem to fit. When I watched it, I couldn't believe all the stupidty it produced. In every movie, I can find good for almost every scene, a way of understanding it and realizing what the director was trying to show his audience, but in this film, it was difficult to do that. I was very displeased in this, for it not only wasted my time, it made me think twice about renting another movie like this again. I would recommend American pie if your looking for a comedy. But for a film that does nothing but show drug usage, and shows no point in doing so, I'd recommend a more worth your while film, like Traffic or Scarface (Al Pacino)."
3,"Funny, but the jokes get old after awhile","This movie is quite funny, but the humour starts to die off after the first half hour. I mean, there are only so many stonner jokes you can do. Not something i would buy, just rent."
2,There are better stoner comedys.,"Half-baked always seemed to me to be a movie about weed, by people who know nothing about weed. I know it is a movie and it is fictional but hallucinating that you are flying from smoking marijuana, expecially from swaggy government weed is so far from reality it is not even funny. I hate it when movies and TV shows depict the effects of marijuana as if it is a PCP trip or something. It is just a pet peeve of mine because it sets the law reform movement way back because idiots who believe what they see on TV, think marijuana makes people see elves and unicorns.I have to admit the films does have some clever stoner puns and is very quoteable, ""wesley pipes"", ""billy bong thorton"" and Bob Saget's cameo line. Yet it does not make up for the rest of the movie being so cartoonishly fake. That is just my two cents."
1,Worthless,I paid for this DVD almost 25bucks and I could not watch it on my DVD or my PS3!!!!! I got hustle!! DON'T BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,Pissed off,Recieved this dvd in good time but am pissed off as it does not work here in australia due to region code. I would think that it would say it only works in th US before i purchased it rather than me throwing my money down th toilet for a dvd i can only watch on the other side of th world
5,"Funny, a cult classic","A great movie, if you have the right sense of humor. I thought it was hilarious, and have watched it about 20 times in the last week! It does get a point across about reefer, and that it can be bad. All in all a great and funny movie, i would recommend it!"
1,Cashing in,"I'm a huge fan of half baked as I'm sure most people are. Hoping to receive more hilarious footage and outtakes of everyones favorite stoners I found myself buying the new edition of this dvd. How could you miss with a list of added features such as..Five Minutes with the ""The Guy on the Couch""Different Types of SmokersGranny's Guide to Bakin'Well they missed big time. The guy on the couch.. some imitation rolling around for five minutes with a pillow covering his face as he rolled of the couch. Lame! Types of smokers.. animated and not even amusing. Granny's baking someone throwing a bunch of things in a pot like a cooking show. The whole thing was poorly produced. The only additional footage was things that they edited out of the film. ie originally they had Kenny calling Thurgood to do the whole scene in the movie where they visited him and tell him how they are going to get him out.This is a pitiful attempt to turn a buck off of Half Baked's fan base. I want my money back."
1,Terrible quality and wrong format,"The movie is great. This DVD is a copy of the video tape. The quality, however, is terrible especially if watched on an HD TV. You can clearly tell it is a copy of a video tape because of the lines on the bottom of the screen. Furthermore this is full screen (4:3) while the original movie was made in 2.35:1 format. I am wondering why amazon.com is selling this copy of the movie while Amazon.de is selling a pristine Blu-Ray copy of the movie in English (or in German with English subtitles) which plays on American Blu-Ray players. Furthermore, the copy sold on Amazon.de is in 2.35:1 format which is the format of the original movie."
1,The tresure of silver lake,"I am a little dispapointed. I can believe you are selling a cheesy copy of an old german classic movie like this. Yes it is in english, but the picture quality is very bad."
1,check out the cactus,I had one Karl May Euro western Rampage at Apache Wells and was keen to get more but heck what is thisrubbish check out the faaaaaaaaaaaaake cactus stuck at and in the line of fire the ones in the entrance to the airport in Memphis look more real the cast are annoying to the point of wishing they were all dead Lex Barker who I normally like is walking around the sets looking like he would prefer to be somewhere else not only a money waster but a time waster avoid this like the mumps Al Watts Radio presenter Australia
1,A mere pamphlet,"Really more a history , with some B/W pictures, plus a few tiny floor plans/elevations on the last page. Does not explain its construction."
2,Editorial issues,"This is a collection of meditations, musings and aphorisms by a cultured and somewhat awakened Westerner, one of the first wave to really encounter the non-dualist teachings. As such it depicts a number of classic themes and ideas, but in a very sketchy manner. It might have been groundbreaking 30 years ago, but now seems somewhat fragmentary. From the same vintage, Teachings of Ramana Maharishi, Alan Watt's Way of Zen, and Krishnamurti's First and Last Freedom are much better edited and written works. The insight is there, the sentiment is real, but as a book it leaves a lot to be desired."
5,"If it is Pokemon, they have to have it","It is Pikachu, or whover he is. Somehow the kids are convinced if it is a special Pokemon Edition GB they will better trainers. My daughter loves the cool colors, they seem better able to pick out their own GB from a pile, so I have been told. This is all I know, they love it. So get it in their favorite color."
1,I hate this! It has stupid little Pikachu!,I hate Pikachu! He is so stupid! This Game Boy unit has Pikachu on it! That is the purebred only reason I absolutely hate this Pokemon product! I think Team Rocket rules and I hate Ash! I am even crying because Team Rocket won't take Ash's Pikachu! I badly want them to and they don't because Ash thinks he'll die without Pikachu! That is so false and I don't like Ash one bit! My name is Justin Pikachuihate and I don't like Pikachu even one little bit! I wished I could get the one with all the starting Pokemon for Gold and Silver on it instead of this one with stupid Pikachu! I don't buy Pokemon products that have a single itty bitty thing to do with Pikachu or even have Pikachu on the box it comes in! Hence the name Justin Pikachuihate! I beg your pardon. Don't buy this one! It has Pikachu on it and that makes it the stupidest thing alive!
3,Swing... and a miss.,"I ordered this for a UPS under the impression that it would be the B.B. Battery so I wouldn't need to worry about the terminals being different. However I received a UB170 in its place which of course, has smaller terminals. Not a show stopper but annoying and not what I paid for. Also as others have stated it was shipped just in a bag.This company did contact me offering to ship the terminal adapters if I would remove this review. However, probably should have sent it with the battery in the first place if you are going to send something different than what was advertised."
1,was NOT a B.B. brand battery,"I purchased a B.B. brand battery but was sent a generic, instead. the photo and item name both mention BB brand but what I was sent was not the type shown in the photo (same size and voltage but not a name-brand item, that's my point). I would not buy from this seller again."
1,Batteries Failed in Rotax Kart Service,"This battery will not hold up in the Rotax Kart. I bought 2 batteries and neither lasted for over 30 minutes. Both failed such that the voltage dropped to ""0"" volts under any kind of load and neither battery would take a charge. This battery is junk for the Rotax application."
2,Wrong Battery Shipped,I placed an order for a 7.2AH 12V B.B. Battery. Recieved a 7AH 12V B.B. Battery. Waiting on response from company. First experience with company not so good...
5,Lovely Book,I picked this book up at the library for my 2 year old who is quite speech delayed. I had never seen it before and as we turned the pages we were thrilled at the marvelous pictures. She practiced animal soundss and found plenty of new words to try along with the counting. Wonderful. When my 4 year old read it with me she noticed a mistake. I don't know if Anno did it on purpose but my daughter noticed it immediately. Here's a hint. On one of the pages the number of animals is incorrect. Have fun!!
5,Endless enjoyment,My sons loved this quiet book and asked to count the items in the lovely illustrations endlessly. Anno includes a bit of whimsy on the final page if you are thorough in your counting!
3,good western,"italian western...Richard Crenna stars as a man who is called ""Noon"" because he has amnessia and has no other name.As he wanders the west searching for his identity,he learns that he is seeking revenge for the murders of his wife and child. With the help of an outlaw named Rimes (Stephen Boyd) and a beautiful woman he sets out to find the man responsible for killing his family...a Louis L'Amour storey...dvd quality...Front Row Features dvd says remastered picture and sound with features,however sound is good,picture is a vhs transfer,no real features to talk about except for chapter stops and two actors bio's...so good storey,hard to get dvd,try to get better dvd copy if possible but price only $ 12.99 for this copy."
3,A good story ruined,Have just watched the remastered version and thought I was in for a treat when the opening scenes stayed close to the book. But extremely disappointed with the second half when even expected dramatic licence went over the top for Spaghetti western pyrotechnics.I could only recommend to those whose challenge is to collect all Louis L'Amour based films as opposed to someone wanting a good western to watch.
4,Great Little Address Book,"If you like Anne Taintor, you'll like this address book, although you may think, like I did, that you have seen funnier Anne Taintor pictures that they could have used. I am really happy with this, though, and it makes me smile every time I use it. I love the photos and the snarky sayings.As an address book, it has enough space for me (20 spaces for each letter), and if you use pencil, you can erase addresses easily enough. There is also space for an e-mail address and phone number. The cover is slightly thick, so I think it would weather pretty well, and the size is small enough to throw in a purse."
3,"I guess I didn't understand the full definition of ""used""",The address book is great but I was a little disappointed when I received it. I purchased a used copy but I assumed that just meant that the cellophane was removed or something minor like that. I didn't realize there would be old entries in the address book. So now I have all these strangers mixed in with my family and friends. I will not buy a used address book again.
4,Must have!,"This is the smoothest, easily applicable liquid liner out on market. The brush tip allows for great control and line thickness, unlike felt-tip applicators. The formula glides on smoothly and has rich color to it. It's definitely a must have for your makeup bag."
4,Love the brush-tip eyeliner!,"Don't take away my preferred brush-tip eyeliner. I find pencils or felt-tip eyeliners are not for me. This type goes on easily, sometimes I have to wipe a little off the brush beforehand. Can't find the this nice dark brown in the stores, so I was very happy to find it online. Buy a couple at a time and the P&H isn't so bad."
2,Probably more for display,"This guy really doesn't do much. Ours is attached to a basement beam and well, he does fly around in a circle but other than that, well, you get the idea. If you are looking for a room decoration, however, this guy is fabulous! It looks super cool hanging from your Batman fan's bedroom ceiling along with Superman and the other JL figures. I do recommend him for display purposes but not for play. When asked why this Batman isn't played with I got ""He's just boring - all he does is fly in a circle."""
1,NOT for a 3 year old....waste of money,"My husband got it for our son disregarding the age recommendation. It's bulky, hard to use, and has SHARP spikes for the ""ears"" on the mask and the things on the gloves. We had to take it away for fear of the 3y.o. injuring the 1 y.o. with it. All it does is ""fly"" because the big bulky wing/cape setup doesn't completely come off to let you just play with the doll. It partially comes off and hangs there. The whole doll is strangly triangular shaped????Anyway, a waste of money."
5,FOZZY RULES!,"you like classic metal? i mean REAL metal from the 80's and early 90's? well, if u do, this cd is for u. you will not be dissappointed with the quality of this cd. you will enjoy every, EVERY, track of this cd. NO LIE!from the butt-kicking track of ""too kill a stranger"" to the blazing fast track ""freewill burning"" to the nostalgic ""big city nights"" and ""balls to the wall"", you will find yourself loving every momment of it."
4,Not being a wrestling fan...,"...I decided to pick up the original Fozzy CD at the request of a friend of mine (a real Chris Jericho fan). My friend new how much I enjoy old school heavy metal 80's and early 90's music and that would be one of the reasons why he recommended it to me. I loved that one and I love this one just as much is not more. Irvine or Jericho or Mongoos' or whatever you want to call him has an extremely powerfulvoice perfect for this genre. And the members of Stuck Mojo who make up the rest of the band meld perfectly with Irvine/Jericho/McQueen. I would not go so far as to say they top the people who originally sang these songs, but I will say this CD definately earns 4 stars in my book. I would give it 4 and a half, but alas I cannot."
4,The Next Big Thing,"It's kind of a shame that Chris Jericho can't divert more time to writing and recording his and my favourite kind of music, METAL, because he has done another great job here. His own selections stand up well with the metal classics he covers, and he covers them with honest sincerity that only a true fan of classic heavy metal can. The next album and I hope to hell there is one, should be all original material. There's no real mis-steps, Although I could do without the title track and ""Where Eagles Dare"". Why ""To Kill A Stranger"" isnt all over rock radio doesn't surprise, just makes me mad. I'm lovin' what I hear on this disc. Fozzy used to be a joke, but Jericho isn't laughing. He's serious, and the music is better for it. Great CD! Please purchase now!"
2,Outrageously hideous!,"This is the most outrageous exaggeration of ""prog"" metal(as the media and the masses seem to enjoy using that label)to ever be released. On top of that Jason McMaster is horrendous on vocals at best. Alan Tecchio didn't fare much better in the follow-up either. I give this 2 stars for 2 reasons. Number one (1) it isn't pop metal which was rampant in the mid eighties and (2) it actually it quite unique in it's own strange way as they attempt...I repeat, attempt to display musicianship by combining current trend thrash metal with fusion. But anyway, you know the stuff ain't good when you can't even enjoy it after a tokin' a bowl."
4,Great,"I will not bother to write a different review for each Zatoichi movie. I have all twenty six of his movies and have watched all of them multiple times. Although the believability of a blind swordsman is next to nill, Zatoichi makes it believable because you will fall in love with the character. Shintaro Katsu is one of my all time favorite actors."
3,"Overlooked, catchy song","This was a minor overlooked hit from the overlooked career of Billy Lawrence. Definitely a good song though with interesting vocal arrangement. Billy's voice is unique and not very powerful, but she seems to know what works for her. This single has only the radio edit and snippets of other songs on the album. The radio edit works better than the album version, cutting out the keyboard solo that really doesn't add much to the song anyway."
5,More electronic sounding AmAnSet is great!,"This album is a great release for AmAnSet. It more electronic than previous releases but it really works well for them. The tunes on ""know by heart"" easily blend into the electronic sound. her space holiday and AmAnSet were meant to work together. The two unreleased gems make this album really worth buying. ""These Days"" is a cover of a her space holiday song from ""manic expressive"" and desert eagle is from an old 7"". Get this album if you love amanset and if your tastes include electronic sounds."
5,timely,"Jeffers would not be surprised by the timeliness of his poetry as issues of globalization, war, terror, environmental carelessness, and hubris once again flood our daily lives. His poetry resonates with a distaste for the very ""inhumanities""--though he would consider them wholly human--that have brought us to this state of the world. The endless cycle which he mentions so many time is repeating itself once again, and his wisdoms and voice are gathered into a wonderful collection of his finest poetry.One reading Jeffers in search of hope for humanity will be sorely disappointed, as his inhumanism is present on every page. It is not hopeless, however; the beauty of nature and the wild god of the world persist despite man's best efforts to tame and abolish them. Poems like ""Vulture"" are the only glimmer of hope that Jeffers has for mankind: recognize our place in the world and embrace it. That is the ultimate existence."
4,pretty decent collection with minor wear on packaging,"As far as the DVD set itself goes, its a great collection of early Hammer films that resurrect the classic Universal monsters that we all know and love, added with gore, tits, and the acting talents of both Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee. It's got the first three Dracula movies, the first two Frankenstein movies, and The Mummy. My actual set that I received was slightly crushed since it came in a flexible mailer (bad choice, Goodwill). Other than that, I highly recommend this set to anyone intersted in horror films."
3,2 of 5 DVD's skipped,"ok, what can I say, i love classic horror films. I really like christopher lee but i gotta say that i was disappointed in the quality of the dvd. For example the mummy is a good film but the dvd skipped way too much. The Frankenstein films are really good. All in all get this colllection only if you really like old horror films."
3,"IT'S OKAY, BUT I HAD A BETTER SET IN MIND","My set would have been The Curse Of Frankenstein/ Horror Of Dracula/ The Mummy/ Curse Of The Werewolf/ The Evil Of Frankenstein/ Dracula Prince Of Darkness/ Dracula Has Risen From The Grave/ Scars Of Dracula/ Horror Of Frankenstein/ Dracula A.D. 1972/ Frankenstein And The Monster From Hell, with some sort of bonus features better than the ones in this set. Like commentaries and short behind the scene featurettes. NOW THAT'S A GREAT HAMMER HORROR BOX SET I WOULD BUY! And that's ALL I have to say about THAT."
5,Hammer Horror Classics,"I am a big fan of the Hammer horror films. While, the scripts were adequate, the actors were brilliant and top-rate, and managed to inject complete believability into what they had to work with. In my opinion, however, the primary genius behind these films was director, Terence Fisher, who managed to give these films a look and style quite apart from anything that had ever been done before, which very few people have managed to match in today's ""quick cutting, camera-whipping to the point of nauseum, get-as-much-information-as-you-can-to-the-audience"" filmmaking. Great horror is not about overt blood-letting, it's about classy style. Fisher, his crew and cast, had style."
5,Enjoyable horror,"Saw ""the Curse of Frankenstein"" in a theater 50 yrs ago. Made such an impact on me that i studied science and became a surgeon. So nice to see it again. Love that dark moody nineteenth century feel and unapologetic dramatic acting without the tongue in cheek slant or the too sexy young vampires. This six pack is a great bargain. These Hammer films are wonderful and enjoyable for women too."
4,Worked Fine After 2nd Charge Cycle,"Original Dell Latitude D600 Laptop C-MOS Reserve battery began to fail after 9 years (clock kept losing time). The replacement battery pack arrived in 3 days, and although the wires were longer than the original battery, it fit fine, albeit snugly. Per the instructions, the battery was charged for 24 hours. Unfortunately, the computer's clock continued to lose time. The seller, who was very responsive, advised to do a second 24-hour recharge cycle, which enabled the battery to meet expectations. If it hadn't, the seller would have replaced it.Under the unmarked, green, shrink-wrap packaging are six, 1.2 volt NiMH micro-batteries, wired in series, to combine for 7.2 volts. One can only guess if they're fresh, genuine, German-made Varta batteries, as were the originals."
1,good,"good, great, awesome, long lasting, waterproof, im probably going to buy more when i ran out so keep it coming and thank u"
4,Great Find,"Lights up and Looks great, I hope it keeps the umds in one place so my son can be more organized."
4,Just what I needed,I needed a carrier for my many various psp games and could only find carries for up to 6 games usually. Really nice for the price. The LED light it comes with I've used more as a night light than for whatever purpose it was supposed to have but it is still neat.
1,Yet another crummy BOOTLEG from Televista,"Why does Amazon let this company (Televista, aka Jef Films) keep selling its garbage wares here?Just look at that utterly junk quality cover art. Yeah, sure, it's a reproduction of the original theatrical poster - after being run over by a semi- several times, then soaked in a rain barrel for a week and a half. Still, it's better looking than the picture quality on the actual DVD itself.BE WARNED: Televista is a video pirating operation. They do NOT have the rights to any of the films for which they release discs, which are mastered from old VHS copies that they probably bought on eBay (or this site). DO NOT GIVE THEM YOUR MONEY - you WILL be sorry. Caveat emptor..."
2,a bad version of pinocchio,"this movie was just a b-movie in the form of pinocchio, but usually in b-movies the story line is laim so they trow in a lot of nudity to make it worth watching, in this case not enough to make it work watching, just a laim sorta funny money."
2,A bunch of fluff,"I am not impressed with this book. All she does is describe the situation everyone is dealing with with ADD and says ""oh well you just have to settle for it"". There are no concrete solutions in this book. Don't buy this book it's a waste of time and money."
3,Just OK,"The leather is nice, but unlike the synthetic versions, when the pouch is squeezed, it does not open fully, so it can be difficult to get change in and out quickly."
5,Hot looking boots,"What a deal first of all! and they look so awesome on! Very comfortable and easy to walk on, though maybe it's not for taking long walks but short ones, definitley!"
2,Bad Fit,"The boots were too big around my calves and I usually don't have any trouble with that. It was a pretty good deal, but I will be sending mine back."
2,not very useful...,"I own more than several books by the same author. They are all cute, well designed, practical and with gorgeous pics.But this book is... meh. Pics are pretty, but I can't apply none of them at my small condo. From the pics, I guess I will need major remodeling, landscapes, major purchase, etc... and I am Japanese, and lots of Japanese homes don't look like the pics, either... We are not that Zen like the text tells you, and our homes are cluttered and messy as well, but just much smaller than the US homes!I gave away the book to a charity bookstore. Sorry..."
5,best dog food container out there!,We have had this container for 5 years without a problem! We just got a new dog and need another container and it is the one we are going to get. Never a problem with cracking or the seal like the other poster has said. Rubbermaid products are the best out there for people and dogs :-)
3,Upbeat Liks Track - Rare A Capella Included,"Picked up this rare CD single in the Fall of '94, as a promo for their upcoming album Coast II Coast that dropped February of 1995. The track was produced by E-Swift, and contains a sample of ""Gimme Me What You Got"" by Le Pamplemousse. What's unusual about this single is that E-Swift samples ""Nautilus"" by Bob James, but it's not listed as one of the tracks sampled. If it sounds familiar, it's because it was also sample by Jeru on his solo debut, and Ghostface on Daytona 500. The CD single tracklisting:1. Daaam! (Radio Edit) (3:59)2. Daaam! (Album Version) (4:49)3. Daaam! (Instrumental) (4:49)4. Daaam! (Swift Mix) (4:31)5. Daaam! (Swift Mix Instrumental) (4:30)6. Daaam! (Acapella) (3:27)Overall this is upbeat party music. Not the best Liks song, but still a hard-to-find CD single."
4,"Short, but good collection.","Truth be known, there's a few better ""Stray Cats"" collections around. But, even though this is only 10 tracks, it does have what's essential. Included is ""Rock This Town"", ""Stray Cat Strut"", and ""(She's) Sexy + 17"", probably their three biggest hits. The other seven on here are all good though, and possibly recognizable even to the casual fan. This is great for the price, but if you need more, check out ""Greatest Hits"", or the lengthy ""Runaway Boys: '81-'92""."
5,What are they up to now?,"If you love these guys as much as i do, you owe it to yourself to pick up the ""Swing Cats"" CD. A repository of ex-Stray Cats' Slim Jim Phantom & Lee Rocker plus ex-members of the Polecats, the Swing Cats continue the Stray Cats conventions while covering artists as diverse as Carl Perkins, Hank Williams Sr. (""Mind Your Own Business"") and Benny Goodman, with vocals supplied by an array of guests. Quite Good!"
3,"good information, except when it is wrong.","I like the style in which this book is written. It makes it easier to learn about optics. I just wish that the formulas were all correct. Our professor had to give us pages of corrections pointing out errors in formulas, or error in simple math. I found a formula that used tangent when sine is what was needed. Since the angle was not small, this was a problem. Sometimes when I am looking at the examples in the book, I feel like a teacher going through a student's work trying to find where the student went wrong to get the answer that is given. I've never seen this many errors in a text book before."
2,Minding Bekoff,"The publisher's advertising states ""In 'Minding Animals' Marc Bekoff offers a thought-provoking look at animal cognition as well as the deep emotional livers of our animal kin. This book is an important contribution to our understanding of animal consciousness.""Unfortunately, only 25% of the book is about animal cognition. The remaining 75% is devoted to how Bekoff feels about animals. In other words, if you select a sentence at random, about 75% of the time it will be a platitude such as: ""Interacting closely with many animals on their own terms has had a large effect on my own reflections on my place in the universe."" Doubtless Bekoff is a distinguished scientist and an admirable human being, but for the reader who already loves animals and/or science, that kind of writing (paragraph after paragraph) is painfully tedious. I wanted to grab Bekoff by the collar and shake him -- Marc, just tell us about the bloody animals!"
5,Wonderful Book about one of America's Premiere Institutions,"Although the book is small, it contains beautiful color plates and detailed descriptions of the Rare Books collection in the Smithsonian Institution Libraries. The book also tells of the history of the Smithsonian library, and the museums themselves. There are sections of the book devoted to the different collections, including many rare book on science and technology, as well as art and the humanities.For anyone interested in rare book and manuscript collections, this book offers a great deal of information on the collections at the ""largest museum"" in the world."
2,3 songs good,"The other reviews on this cd are wrong,this is not a great albumby far.The production is clumsy and there are few good original ideas here.That said this clealy is a debut album and there area couple of good tracks,but nothing to shout about.Go buy ""blowyour headphones"" by the herbaliser instead!"
1,too small for a coloring book,This is the about 4 by 5 inches- the size of a small Beatrix Potter book. No where in the description does it mention that. Very disappointed.
4,A page-turner indeed,"Just finished the book this morning and will be starting on part 2 after work. As other reviewers have said...this book is about the characters and the story is told through them with the action being down-played. I love Star Wars and I love the various forms of ""Star Wars Action"" that we find in their novels. However, I recently finished ""Shatterpoint"" which I found to be filled with action, yet over-drawn and kinda ""boring.""Anyway, medstar-1 rocked and is a good, quick, easy, and most importantly ""enjoyable"" read. If you're a Star Wars fan...pick it up and enjoy yourself!"
5,Another excellent book in the Star Wars series!,"Especially since this book takes us into a part of the Star Wars universe never really explored in depth before. One could call it either an ""ER"" or even a ""M.A.S.H."" in space, even though it is much more than both. A fascinating and exciting read, just like: ""Stranger in a Strange Land"", ""Puppet Masters"", ""Foundation"", ""2001"", ""2010"", ""Rendezvous with Rama"", ""Ringworld"", all the ""Star Trek"" and other ""Star Wars"" books, ""Advent of the Corps"" and other great sci-fi or space operas."
2,Read only if no other Star Wars book is available,"Generally OK. But a weak series. Star Wars meets MASH in a ""Tales of the Cantina"" type character mesh. I gave it a 2 because something kept me going, mostly the wonder if anything at all was going to happen. The only thing more boring than this book, would be being a charcter in the book. If you want something really different from SW then this may be a 5-star for you."
5,Loved It!,"I was so happy when I found that it was Jedi Padawan Barriss Offee who was the Jedi in this novel. She was in Approaching Storm, and she left me wanting more of her after that one. Also, I-Five, from the novel Darth Maul: Shadow Hunter is in this, and I think he is such a character! I love when authors bring in characters you wish to hear more of, and that is what this book does. I highly recommend this book, and its sequel!"
3,M*A*S*H in space...sort of,"I originally bought this book based on how the back cover made it sound like it was MASH, Star Wars style. I love both MASH and Star Wars, so I thought putting them together would be awesome. It's not bad, but not that great either.This book is on the verge of making way too many MASH-like references, down to the main wise-cracking surgeon, to an alien phrase that's obviously from ""meatball surgery"". But before you get too critical, the whole idea has an interested message: even in a technologically advanced and sophisticated future, war is still violent and pointless.So all in all, give this book a chance. As soon as I finished this one, I went out to buy the next one. The middle drags a bit, but the end is pretty good. Overall an entertaining book."
1,Terrible!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I am not going to go into detail about this book because it is sooooooo bad! I am just going to say that this book is the worst starwars book I have ever read in my entire LIFE!!! There is like hardly have to do anything to do with battleing.p.s: May the force be with you all.
1,Capcom should be Ashamed,"This is the absolute worst Meage Man X game there is. The bosses stink. The armors are pathetic. The timer makes the game more annoying than interesting. DON""T BUY THIS GAME! SAVE YOUR MONEY! Hopefully X6 will be much better."
2,Correction,"Amazon.com's review seems to have been by someone who barely ever played any Mega Man game, much less the one being reviewed. ""Fourth"" is not the name of a character in the game; rather, it is the name of a set of armor that X can wear to improve his abilities. All Mega Man games have infinite continues except for the very first one, the Legends series, and the GBA titles. And it was always possible to destroy most bosses with your default weapon, it was just tougher that way (and it's still like that). I also have yet to determine how X5, which came out right between X4 and X6, qualifies as ""a long-overdue return"" to anything other than the frustrating level design that plagued some early Mega Man games. In short, this is indeed a very poor excuse for a Mega Man game, but not for the reasons cited in the product description. It's better than the old DOS PC games, though."
2,This sucks!,"I think X5 is a very boring game.It's just way to easy.Compared to X4,X5 really sucks.The bosses are pittifully weak,and these names really sucked.Axle the Red?What kind of name is that? The only improved thing is the music and the anime films in the game.So if you haven't bought this yet,I suggest that you just forget about it."
2,What is this series coming to?,This game flat out stinks. The timer is a stupid idea. The game is way too easy. X4 seems to get praised quite a bit even though it wasn't that great. X1 and X3 are the best in this series. Forget about X5.
3,A must get game for Megaman fans!,"This game is good but it could have been better and have been made longer and a bit harder. Overall the game is great if your a megaman fan but my advice is to get the megaman battle network ,the best game on GBA! The good thing about this game is that you get loads of new armors and colorful grapics and enjoyable levels, a bit hard at first but once your used to megaman style controls its easy."
2,"Misleading title, not what you think it is.","This was originally called hedge witch and is fine for what it is, letters about wicca that weren't meant to be a book. This is *not* the best guide to the wiccan path for the solitary practitioner that I could think of. Why would they name it this? I hesitate to query, but I can't help thinking that it was renamed this to cash in on Scott Cuningham's book 'Wicca: A guide for the solitary practitioner' which *is* what it says it is... probably the best plus being about the religion not just magic as a previous reviewer said was one of the good points about this book. If it wasn't so misleading I wouldn't give this such a harsh review. But it is not the best book a beginer could get. Blessed Be... Grail."
1,Best sleep I've had in years,"While TRYING to read this book I found myself unable to concentrate on what Rae had to say. She often defines things so oddly that's it's IMPOSSIBLE to undertand what she means. Paragraph after paragraph of useless information. I wasn't looking for confusing detail about what Wiccan ment to her. I wasn't looking for a book that consistantly put down Christain beliefs. All I wanted was a book that told me the basics around the Wiccan religion, how to practice the Wiccan religion myself, and then after I understood those then I might want to know some stuff about the history of the Wiccan Religion. This book gave me nothing but a good night sleep after boring me to death."
1,Dull,A very boring book with too much knee-jerk anti-Christian statements. Very little information is communicated through this book.
5,Liger Zero,Excellent quality...the metal and plastic feel sturdy.Figure comes with a decal sticker sheet and instruction booklet.You can use a Gundam detail marker for the lines if you want it to look like the one on the box.Getting it into a few posses is impossible thanks to some of the armor.Still a great buy and can't wait for my Jager unit to come in.
2,"I recommend buying another ""Reformed Pastor"" for Kindle","As soon as I looked at this book on my Kindle, I noticed that the letters were stuck in some kind of weird Helvetica font. I couldn't change the font to my preferred Caecilia Condensed. Also, when I compared this kindle book to another on Amazon, I noticed that it lacked the basic table of contents the other one had, so I returned this and got the other one that had the table of contents to allow for quick browsing of the book. Also, when I opened the more organized ""Reformed Pastor"" kindle book, I noticed that it allowed me to change the font into whatever I wanted.Summary: If you are looking for this book on your kindle, consider getting the other options that are available on Amazon. This one needs more polishing. The content in itself however is amazing for a 400 year old book!"
4,The Reformed Pastor,"While at times it is difficult to read the older style English in which it is written, there are pearls of wisdom to be found in this old gem for anyone in a pastoring role in a church."
2,Could have been...,"a better movie. There is nudity so it isn't a family movie. The subject of the movie is not too bad and could have been watched by most of the family if not for the nudity. I don't even know why it is in this movie. It did nothing for it except detract from it. The movie doesn't do a great job at explaining why the oldest son is so angry. The acting is fine but could use some fine tuning.A couple and their children live with the deaths of their previous family members during the war. A sad, sad story."
3,Better or worse?,"For those of you that have seen the anime and like it, be warned that the manga seems to be nothing like the anime, save for the names, and a little bit of looks.The manga series is only 3 long, and seems to focus more on ""upskirt"" shots, more than anything, to me. And the storyline does tend to go off on a tangent from the anime series. But overall, I believe this to by a fairly okay manga by itself.Just don't mix it up with the anime."
1,Proceed with Caution,"Kaplan is like a rapist in a bar looking for a naive girl who needs a ride home. They will tell you that they help people improve their MCAT score by an average of 8 points by enrolling in their program. A little thought can help one realize however, that this is far from the truth. In fact they have no ideal about how writting is graded on the MCAT or what sophisticated biology material looks like because they know that they can sell the old stuff and make the same ammount of money. They forget to tell you that an added pressure of 1200 spent dollars sits on your shoulders as you are taking an exam where PRESSURE AND STRESS DETERMINE ALL. Needless to say, real statistics show that Kaplan hinders more than it helps. About 85% of currently enrolled medical student's IQ was reflected in their choice to have not used Kaplan. Try this out for your self. Ask around. It is true. Proceed with caution before purchasing anything from this company!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Good Review of Science,"This book is a very good review of all the science topics if you have already learned them. I didn't find them very confusing. They were concise for the most part. Every so often, the author(s) would start naming body parts, or enzyme precursors that you really didn't need to know, but I have heard that other books are even worse. I think this book will reteach you just about everything you need to know for the MCAT. Good Luck!"
5,Great idea,We bought Leapsters for our twin 5 yr old sons. They are educational and fun and our sons absolutely love them! One problem is that they run on batteries and we had to keep changing them. We then found this item and we are ever so grateful. The boys place the leapster on the charger at night and they are ready to go for another full day of playing. What a relief! They used to get so upset if we didn't have batteries to replace and now there is no need. They have a fully charged leapster every time.
4,A Must Have Accessory,We bought our daughter the Leapster system for Christmas and purchased the charger to go with it to save money on batteries. It takes a few hours to charge it for 10 hours of play according to the directions...personally I think it lasts much longer than that. The only problem is you kind of have to wiggle the leapster on the charger to get the green light to come on. My 5 year old has figured out how to do this so it's not difficult. Other than that I think it's a great accessory.
4,No problem installing!,"Ordered mine in Nov '04 & came with new back plate which solves the problem others mentioned having (very easy install), but mine at least is very sensitive. Needs to be placed in the charger very gently, push hard & light will go out indicating full charge when it's nearly drained.Still, it's a minor glitch & the kids still enjoy it as a break. No, ours don't play it non-stop for hours (it's video games!) but they return to it 3 or 4 times daily for 30 minutes or longer & that's a lot of extra learning time!I think as more games are developed (and prices drop), this might well become a staple for kinder thru 6th."
3,"Wonderful accessory, but needs tweaking!","The Leapster Recharging System is a wonderful accessory, but it needs to be improved (and hopefully retrofitted for us current owners!). The contacts on the back of the Leapster don't maintain their connection with the recharging base. The charging light goes off several times before the Leapster is fully charged. The unit needs to be wiggled so it connects again, the light goes on, and it continues charging. We considered vibrations as the culprit, and tried setting it up in uninhabited rooms to no avail. We like the idea of not changing batteries, but we don't like babysitting this thing!!LeapFrog.......HELP PLEASE!"
2,Good if you only own 1 Leapster...,"Two of my sons have Leapsters, and we're planning to purchase another one for my third son this year. As you can imagine, we go through a lot of batteries. This recharging system only works for ONE leapster. It includes a pack of enclosed batteries and a new back to replace the original back of the Leapster being charged. I contacted the company to see if I could order another back and battery pack, but they do not (and will not) sell them separetly.I'm taking the Recharging system back to the store tomorrow, and I plan to purchase a regular battery charger and rechargeable batteries. If you need a charger for two or more Leapsters I suggest you do the same. You'll save yourself some money and you can use the charger for more than just one item."
5,A Must Have For Your Leapster,"We purchased a Leapster 2 years ago when they first came out. The recharger was not available then. I have gone through so many batteries with a now 4, 7 and 8 year old playing with it, especially on long car trips. I am so happy that I found it on Amazon, since I could not find it in the stores sold seperately. The kids know how to recharge this and their gameboys all at the same time. It is for my 4 year old girl, who calls it her gamegirl, but the boys love the games for the older kids."
1,Burned Up Unit!!,"This item we *thought* would be an awesome alternative to batteries but it wasn't! After a few weeks of using it, it actually burnt up my daughters Leapster, We were able to exchange the Leapster threw the company but still out the $25.00 we paid for the charger when we got it. I am not sure if I am going to purchase another one either. Company says there has been a handful of complaints about them...we will see if they actually upgrade them before I do actually buy a replacement."
3,BUYER BEWARE,"While it does charge very nicely, the attachment that fits the Leapster does not seem to have been made for it. My husband and I had a heck of a time trying to get the screws in because one of the holes just didn't match up at all. Don't bother trying to return it either because you'll just end up with another that doesn't match. We decided to just deal with it since once we attached it another way it held a charge very well. The unit itself is very easy to work with. I gave it three stars because of the ease of use and the length of time the charge lasts. If i went solely on the ease of attaching the adapter to the Leapster, i'd give it one to no stars because it's a royal pain to make it stay on."
1,Totally Confused,"We bought our daughter the Leapster for Christmas and the recharging station was nowhere to be found. We just went back to find that there are different stations depending on the different type of Leapster. After purchasing the one that Clearly corresponds to the Leapster we purchased, we got it home to find that our Leapster is the wrong shape - looks like our daughter will have to continue to be plugged into the wall when she's playing! (I know we can buy batteries...and probably will, but what a hassle!!! - not to mention an additional expense!)"
1,Be careful of which Leapster you have,"Please pay close attention to which Leapster you have before purchasing this product. This recharger does not work with the pink Leapster( or any of the smaller versions). I purchased this for my daughter's birthday to go with the pink Leapster I purchased. It was linked on the Pink Leapster page to add this recharger to the order. I did and when I got it, I found that it isn't compatible. I called Leap Frog and they said that the L-Max recharger is needed for the Pink Leapster. make sure you get the right charger for your system!"
2,Doesn't always work,"I bought the recharging kit last Christmas because I thought it would save me money in the long run. It didn't take long to install.. a couple minutes at the most. And yes, I used the silver backplate instead of the original one. At first it worked fine, but then I began noticing that whenever me or my son would put it on the charging dock, the light would go off after a few seconds. To keep the light on, we have to keep jiggling the leapster around which is really annoying. Because of this problem, my son rarely plays with it anymore and I can't blame him.. Who wants to deal with a toy that lasts a few minutes before dying because it can't charge properly? The company really has to fix this problem because it's really dicouraging to buy a recharging system that doesn't work."
2,Dusty and noisy,"These brakes are emit a lot of dust and make way too much noise, the basic model you get at autozone doesn't even have these problems. They will stop the car however."
4,della reece swing slow & chacha cha,If you're over 40 years old and haven't heard NOT ONE MINUTE MORE it's one of the nicest ballads i have heard in a long time.Ihappened to hear this song on a canadian station while driving. Ihad to look it up on the internet to find the album with this great song This song was recorded in 1961.Della Reese has a voice as good as Witney Houstin.
4,Excellent wallets,I give two thumbs up to these wallets. They hold enough disks to be handy but not so many that they become hard to use. Seem to be well made.
5,Steppin' Out reaches for the stars,"I'm a big fan of small combos and got into Diana Krall by accident. I first bought Love Scenes and fell in love with her voice and her piano arrangments. It was only natural to see where she came from so I bought her first album and can't stop listening to it. It's been a year since I got Steppin Out and I still cherish the tunes. Her arrangements are phenomenal and quite possibly the most beautiful song I've heard is track 10, 'Jimmie' a dedication to her father and her piano mentor.Beautiful as beautiful can be."
2,I was not satisfied with the quality,I was not satisfied with other L'Oreal products. I do not know what is wrong with that but that is not comparable to what I got before from the same brand but in store.
5,Winner of the WordWeaving Award for Excellence,"Through his impressive example, Grandpa teaches an older boy how to love the beach as they feel the water and smell the sea air. Indeed, Grandpa loved the wind, the woods, the city, the people, the animals and all things that inhabit those spaces. With his grandpa, the boy learns to listen, to feel, and to love his world, too.Featuring the distinctive, water colors of illustrator Maureen Hyde,GRANDPA LOVED will touch the hearts of the young, and the young at heart. The spectacular illustrations reveal the illustrator's impressive technique with surprising detail and realism, seeming to glow on the page as they accompany the simple message of love and memory. With a creative appeal to the senses and to the heart, author Josephine Nobisso shows how the love of grandpa lives in the lessons he shared. Simple yet wise, GRANDPA LOVED is destined to become a classic. Very highly recommended."
1,The costume was missing the hat,The costume is fine. The boot part is not great. The costume came without the hat which was disappointing for my son.
4,Pretty and true to size,"Fits great, sparkles in all lighting. Love it!Closest match to an old marcasite I had that my dog ate so I'm happy to have a such a pretty replacement. Thanks!"
1,Don't get this,"This guy messes with your mind and smiles in your face while he does it. It's not worth the money. I've read the book and purchased this dvd and it doesn't help at all. The only self-satisfaction I've aroused by having this book and dvd is when I dropped them both in the garbage. Try reading a good researched book by Dale Carnegie, anything else then a book like this filled with opinions, endless/useless personal stories about flying planes, and getting divorced by his wife. I should have known this guy was rubbish and a gimmick when I first learned of this book from a crappy talkshow. This is just Gary Coxe's next hustle, after all, he is an oppurtunist and if you look at his official site, he has a ton of self-help books (that don't help at all), cd's and dvd's priced all the way up to $300, this man makes me sick."
1,Broken...,It was good for the first two weeks! The stitching on the nylon belt is not that great. The part that goes under the door separated from the rest due to bad stitching...
2,All info not provided,I just got these and they all expire 11/11. What a rip off that the exp date was not put on sale site. These are for a first aid room and I will never use all of these by Nov. I should have spent more money and got ones that exp next year. Never again
4,good,received in good condition. but the expy date is very near so i would not able to use all of medication by the end of the expy date
3,Save a couple of dollars and buy the mail-order version,"Unless you need a pretty box, the mail order only version (One Touch Ultra Mail Order Test Strips, 50 CT) is exactly the same as these, but cheaper.If you're paying for test strips yourself, you should look at the WaveSense meters. (See:Wavesense Keynote System Kit) The WaveSense strips are roughly $9 per box less expensive. If you're using 8-10 strips per day, that translates to a $1000+- savings each year. The WaveSense meters also claim to be more accurate than other systems."
4,Item is as described,"Exact same as being described, But as it is date sensitive material, so expiry should also be mentioned while selling such things online"
1,Expires Soon,I ordered from this company because they had the lowest price on Amazon. I didn't read the reviews because I was in a hurry and it was very late. As others have said these test strips have a very short expiration date. My parents were borderline diabetics so even though I don't have diabetes and my blood sugar levels are good I like to check it once a month as a precaution. These strips will cost me over $4 per test! Walmart has a much longer expiration date on their strips. I will not purchase from this vendor again.
5,Great Price for a much needed item.,I was pleased to find my diabetic strips at a great price on Amazon. My order arrived in a timely fashion and in perfect condition. The prices at Amazon for my One Touch Testing Strips are a great savings to me compared to purchasing them locally. I highly recommend these to anyone needing diabetic test strips.
1,A Rip Off,The 100 strips that I received had an expiration date of July/2009 which means this purchase was a waste of money. I was upset and disappointed.
1,Expiration Date less than 3-4months,"There's always a catch on buying discounted items. Based from my actual experience, the expiration date is less that 3-4 months. This is not publish during the ordering process. Good if you will be using this product at least once or twice a day so that you can consume it within 1-2 month period."
2,wrong item,ordered this for my mom and it came in a different color box.dissapointed that it wasnt even in english and didnt work. i had to pay to send it and pay to send it back. rally pissed.
5,Love this brand,"I was recently diagnosed with diabetes and was given a One Touch kit from my diabetic educator. Since this is the only brand I've ever used, I cannot compare it to other brands, but I'm very satisfied with One Touch. The lancets don't hurt and the glucometer tests very quickly. This feature is very convenient in the morning when I don't have a lot of time."
4,nothing,where do i start?this cd sounds like a continuation of hivs lyset tar oss but this time the keyboards are more up front and one the trademarks of burzum the vocals are replaced by some extremely distorted vocals that sound more in line with industrial than black metal. but song number 5 is one that a lot arent going to like it is a 25 minute ambient piece while the other are just eletronic pieces but the first three are black metal although different
3,Wisdom,"The title here translates to Wisdom. In many respects, this is viewed as a sell out, cracking the U.K. indy charts. The music remains agressive but Varg distorts his vocals. Not enough tracks to be truly satisfying. A low point for Burzum as a musical project."
4,Good stuff from the Count,"Burzum is a killer act, no doubt about it. The production on this is horrible, but unlike other black metal bands, it doesn't bother me with Burzum because, in a very hard-to-explain way, it helps create the tortured, damning atmosphere. The one thing I don't like is the synthesized vocals instead of the screams on Burzum's s/t. Even though it's very repetitive, the 25-minute keyboard track is great. The first song, as other reviewers have mentioned, is fantastic. Burzum rocks; Oystein Aarseth can eat his decomposing heart out."
4,Very Moody and Very Eerrie and... very long...,"This is an amazing album! listening to this masterpiece almost puts tears to my eyes because of its very emotional and atmospheric sound. varg definetely know how to make black metal sound like its supposed to. dark, sad, angry, emotional, and of coarse grim. one complaint about this album is the 25 minute song its good dont get me wrong but it does seem to drag out for an awefully long time. but hey thats what makes burzum the one of a kind black metal band they are or should i say he is."
3,Pretty good if blacks your thing,Dunkelheit must be one of the best black metal songs. Pure atmosphere. Burzum is pretty much the best BM band (well guy).
3,....,long and boring since songs drag through 10-20 minutes each of ambience and slow emotional passages. Recommended only for die hard burzum fans.
4,John Carpenter's Vampires,"For John Carpenter fans such as myself, this movie is awesome. Pretty gruesome on special effects but done well I thought. And who could play a bad ass better than James Woods? The opening scene will have you asking for more and you wont be able to look away!"
4,Winches and Vampires...,"Where could you go wrong? ANY movie involving shooting a vampire with a crossbow and winching it by jeep into open daylight is woth a watching. It isn't particularly scary, nor the storyline very... complex, but it is an excellent movie for watching on a guys night. Yes, it does fall short of Carpenter's other work, and it is a damn sight far off from the best Vampire movie I've seen... but it's a fun movie to see nevertheless."
4,Not your traditional vampire movie,"John Carpenter has always been a hell of a director, and though a lot of his recent films have not been what many of his fans had hoped they'd be, Vampires will quench the fans thirst of a first rate Carpenter thrill ride. James Woods, Daniel Baldwin, and they're vampire hunting crew are employed by the Catholic church to kill the vampires plaguing western America, but when they discover an all powerful vampire named Valek, thats when the fun begins. It wouldn't be a John Carpenter movie without blood, gore, and body parts flying, and we get plenty of that here. Besides that if you think this is a traditional vampire film, your dead wrong. Every other vampire movie has a gothic, sensual feel, and this sure as hell don't. Its a straight forward action flick with vampires thrown into it, and although it wears thin towards the end, Vampires remains a hell of a movie."
4,Be careful when ordering this DVD...,"I'm not gonna argue about the quality of this movie, if your a John Carpenter fanatic like myself you see a lot of good in it even if it doesn't stand up to his earlier work. One thing about John Carpenter is how distinct all his films are. The look, the music, even the acting are all uniquely stylized. So when you order this DVD make sure to get the Superbit version which is the original 2:35:1 widescreen format, the other version is a crappy 1:33:1 fullscreen version. You can't watch a John Carpenter movie in fullscreen, it just ain't right. ORDER WITH CAUTION!"
1,Beyond Horrible!,"I just have to say that this movie was one of the worst I have seen in a long time. Admittedly, the trailer made it look good, especially the scenes with the head vampire. But five minutes into the film itself I had a feeling it was going to be bad, and I wasn't wrong. Like someone else wrote in their review, the characters are foul-mouthed and mean-spirited. And I don't think I have seen a more misogynistic movie in years. Poor Sheryl Lee. I, too, was confused over the neccessity for the ""Let's tie her to the bed naked"" scene. But my boyfriend said, ""Guys like that stuff"". Whatever. Overall between the mistreatment of women and priests, I found the film very offensive. The soundtrack sounded like a ""From Dusk Til Dawn"" rip-off. Thank goodnes it was ""dollar day"" at the video store."
4,very good vampire film,Carpenters Vampires is a interesting and entertaing film. James Woods (Jack Crow)a tough ruthless vampire hunter carries this film.Thomas Griffith as Valek the 600 year old vampire was a nasty killing machine. The only one I thought was lousy was Daniel Baldwin (Montoya)who looked like he had a bad hangover and his acting showed it.
4,Most Excellent Vampire Film!!!,Some of you are giving this film a hard time. When fewer and fewer vampire films are coming out I think we should give them a chance. This film is excellent. James Woods was COOL. The storyline was awesome. The vampires were great. The FX were great and the action was rad. I especially liked the way the vamps were dragged out into the sunlight. Give the movie a chance. I liked it a lot.
3,Cheesy but decent at times,"This movie had somewhat dull and cheesy dialog,a terrible villain,A stereotypical anti-hero,tough as nails,smart ass and just small name actors with the exception of James Woods.An example of cheesy and just plain stupid:Valek(the main baddie) kidnaps a Father and takes him to a wash,makes him show him a location on a paperbag map.Complete with a campfire!!! and decapitates the father? See what I mean?"
4,a really FUN movie!,"This film had excellent action and plenty of gore. I do agree with most of you; the climax could have been better--which is why I gave this 4 stars and not 5. Although not as exciting as BLADE, John Carpenter's VAMPIRES takes a more serious look (six or seven guys fighting the undead instead of just one). I thought James Woods and Thomas Ian Griffith put on outstanding performances. This would be a good Halloween movie."
1,"So much plot, so little movie","The premise of this movie is predictable for anyone who ever saw the original Dracula; however, John Carpenter must have been too heavily medicated to develop it beyond a camp and often vulgar attempt at teen romp by old (age wise) actors. Had the cast from Scream or even Dawson's Creek been used it could have possibly turned into something more than just watchable. This is good celluloid fodder for matinee or the ""budget"" movie crowd - but eat first don't spend the extra money on movie food. Probably its best asset will be that it will be the only new movie not rented at the video store on the weekend so you won't have to go home empty handed. It is the perfect nap movie. Catch the beginning, catch the ""zzzzzzzzz's"", and catch the credits - an afternoon well spent on a bad-weather day."
2,Nothing Like The Book...,This movie is nothing like the book... Its effects are okay but seriously lacking. Its whole story line is changed and the characters are nothing like in the book. I would seriously not watch this. Go buy the book!!!
3,"""Good Carpenter Horror Film!""","James Woods, Daniel Baldwin, Sheryl Lee and Thomas Ian Griffithstar in John Carpenter's 1998 horror film. A vampire slayer huntsa bloodsucker seeking a special cross. James is great in this andthis dvd has good picture and sound, but only commentary andthe trailer. I recommend this good Carpenter horror film."
2,not a good vampire flick,"i saw this movie in the theatre with several friends, all of us fans of vampire movies whether it be serious like nosferatu or cheesy like from dusk till dawn. We all came out pretty disappointed with this one. nothing new, the vampires in the desert was already done and over done by the dusk till dawn series. It tries to be somewhat serious, but isn't. It's not cheesy enough to entertain either. You'll see very uninteresting vampires, and very unimpressive vampire hunters. This movie did inspire a sequel, Los Muertos, starring Jon Bon Jovi as a the vampire hunter. That movie was so awful it didn't even make it into theatres and Jon bon jovi is wishing to erase it from memory. That's Definitely worth watching."
3,Compelling film from Carpenter.,"This film starts off wonderfully. Great music, great cinematography, and some good dialogue lead the viewer to believe it'll be a great film. The film's plot suffers, however, when it's revealed that James Woods' character is an a**hole. That really soured the whole film.Rental only."
3,The End Was Pretty Good... I Mean The Credits.,"Maybe because it was going to be over soon, it felt like this movie was more enjoyable at the end. The first half of this movie is pretty lame. I thought that James Woods wasn't up to his usual par. Daniel Baldwin was great, but that's because he is kind of a B-List actor and this is a B-List movie. It felt like it should have been on the USA Network or something. There were some cool things to this movie. The plot was pretty good, not the best story but fairly good. Overall I think it could have been better if it had better actors and was a little more scary. It was too rock & roll for me. I would have liked it more if it was creepy. They had a good premise to make it creepy, especially since the church was involved and I find the church to be creepy. Exorcism is a creepy premise too, but they wasted all of these things in favor of action. 3 stars because the ending was pretty good... and it was finally over."
3,Watchable - just,"But for the always impressive James Woods, and the occasional arresting piece of imagary from Carpenter, this wouldn't even get 3 stars. Although based on a book, the obvious inflence on this film was ""Near Dark"". Sadly its not in the same class as that film. Most of the time it plods along and you never really get involved with the characters.For the special effects freaks there are a few impressive moments where the Master Vampire 'Valek' literally rips people in two. But aside from that and James Woods this is not a Carpenter classic. That said it is miles better than the truly awful ""Ghosts of Mars"" that he made after Vampires.Its certainly worth renting, but only after you've done that, would I suggest you purchase, as overall you are only likely to want to see this once."
1,Possibly the worst movie ever made,Any film with the remotest pretention of success should at least attempt to allow the viewer to begin to suspend disbelief. This abortion of a cinematic debacle failed to make even the shadow of an attempt. Don't buy. Don't rent. Don't let anyone give you this monstrosity as a present. Don't waste your time or your money.
1,Not my thing,"I guess I'm really romantically corny about my vampires. This is no Anne Rice. If you want a good flick, check out Bram Stoker's Dracula with Gary Oldman, Anthony Hopkins. Watch Interview with the Vampire. I imagine this movie has it's fans, but it's gross voilence geared to a differnt horror audience than I. I am pretty sure my husband liked it, so maybe this is a guy thing !"
1,"Poor effort, an all-around bad film","From the very start you can tell this is one of those weird-acting movies where they don't go into any of the characters and yet expect you to empathize when they are all killed in the first ten minutes. Doesn't work, I'm afraid. The Catholic conspiracy is about the only good thing...the relationship between the hooker and Woods' right hand man is VERY bizarre. To top it all off, the head vampire is that annoying guy from ""Karate Kid III"""
2,John Carpenter should call it quits now,"Just like any other recent John Carpenter movie, starts out good but has a really bad ending. Loaded with lots bloody violence, but lacks allot of creativity, and the idea has been done to death."
1,Absolutely Ridiculous!,"This is the most ridiculous vampire movie of all time. I found myself laughing at the stupidity of the whole thing. Shame on James Woods for being part of such a third rate film (and THAT'S a compliment!). Definitely not worth the $5 I paid to rent it on Amazon Unbox. I highly UN-recommend this video. If you pay for the DVD, you'll be frightfully sorry."
2,Please Read the Book,"The book to this movie was AWESOME! It was by John Steakley. If you like vampire literature, GET IT! The movie? It was bad. And what's such a shame is that, had they stuck with the book, James Woods would have been perfect. There's one or two moments, and for that, I give it a star, where he very briefly shines through with the original intent. The rest of the flick was just Hollywood garbage and macho crap, nothing like the incredible book. Seriously, READ THE BOOK!"
1,#1 on my list of Worst Movies Ever.,"This movie amazed me, that I could actually sit through it. Even if you thought Anaconda was a great movie with a suprise ending, you'll STILL hate this movie.The method of killing the vampires was original and well done. And was the entire basis of the movie, trailer trash chases vampires, which aparently 'gives him wood'. Never even vaguely scary, with all the plot of a porno. Don't even bother!"
2,it sucks,"if it wasn't for the fact that the ""vampire master"" is hot and had the scene of him biting the hot chicks inner thigh, the movie would suck completely. it's garbage. i hate the rest of the retarded characters. hillbillies"
1,What a mess!,"108 minutes of my life have been wasted. It only gets one star because I can't give it less.This is THE worst vampire movie of all time. I've had bowel movements that are more entertaining.Do yourself a favor, don't rent or buy this garbage, life is to short."
1,Vampires sucked.,"John carpenter owes me 4 bucks. There were NO special effects. Just some stuntwork. The trailer is the best part. The vampires can't fly, they are only as fast as humans, and only ONE of them posseses superhuman strenth. The main vampire has a whole 2 lines in the WHOLE stinkin movie. And those lines were just 3 words long. If yo uthink im lyeing find out for yourself. The action is kind of boreing. And when he stabs the vampires with steaks they STILL dont die until they are dragged into sunlight.... man this was a lame movie. If you want a cool vampire movie.. Buy blade."
4,The Second Best Vampire Movie I Have Ever Seen!,"I haven't seen the new version of Bram Stoker's Dracula, but I don't suppose it exactly fits into this genre. It is horror with vampires, but it is more of the vampire hunter-type like Blade. Blade is the best of those movies. I don't like some of the special effects as much as in Blade, but it does have some pretty awesome scenes. Valek, the master vampire, is a very cool vampire. In the scene where he attacks James Wood's rag-tag band of vampire hunters he shows himself to be a very powerful monster. He cuts a guy in half using his hand like a sword, and easily kills the whole team of hunters except for two of them. He then pursues a truck down the road on foot at nearly 100 mph and leaps fifty feet into the bed. He is more of the old-style vampire, unlike Frost in Blade, who is a newer, hipper vampire. If you like vampires or just good action movies, you should see this."
4,Great vampire flick,"This is a great vampire movie with a good balance of suspense and blood. Some stories in the genre are too heavy on the character's personal stories and light on the gore, or vice versa, but not this well written horror. James Woods is a 'suave' and savvy vampire killer who lets his guard down with the most ruthless head vampire he's ever encountered. He finds out too late he's been double crossed...the blood suckers knew he was coming...but who is the traitor amongst the day walkers and why? Worthy of a space on my 'favorite horror' flicks shelf.Chrissy K. McVay - Author"
3,Vampires,"Well, this is a different, modern day take on the old vampire movies. It starts with a bang and continues almost non stop with only short breaks of explanation in between. A band of vampire hunters ""controlled"" by the church are on the trail of the leader of the undead. He is searching for an ancient cross that will give vampires the ability to walk in daylight. Amazingly James Woods has brought some gravatis to this production, though I cannot get rid of the feeling that he has his tongue firmly wedged in his cheek while this is all going on. Fun with much gore."
3,Read the book then watch the movie,As some may know this movie is based on a book that is very well done.The movie is good but alot is left out or dropped that was in the book.Overall this is worth a few rents.
1,worst movie ever made!!!!,"I wish there was a choice for zero stars, or a scale for how much you hate a movie, because this was the worst movie I've ever seen. I wish I turned it offhalf way through because I couldn't stand to watch any more, but I'm just too thrifty. I paid for it and damnit I watched it, painfully. The characters in this film are all mean, brutal, foul people. James Wood's character tortures a mild mannered priest for information, and he's supposed to be the hero! His idiot sidekick (a Baldwin brother) beats up a hooker, treats her like total crap through the whole movie, THEN says he's in love with her and they head for Mexico. The coolest person in the movie was the vampire! I hated all the characters and I wish the vapmires had killed them all. It would have been a lot more entertaining to watch the vampires deliver their own special brand of justice to these psychopath ""heros"". Save your time and money and don't see this movie."
1,What have movies come to?,"This movie is pure trash by a horror master. The action scenes were very rare and pointless and the dialogue was completely un-original and contrived. Don't waste any money on this, for it is pointless trash. Anyway, as you can see, nobody saw this movie anyway--it bombed at the box-office and with the critics. You either love this movie, or you really HATE it--in my case, that is what happened."
4,Vampiros: te va a poner los pelos de punta,"Vampiros es una pelicula que, aunque es tenebrosa, saca provecho de la sangre que derrama: nada es sin razon. Se trata de un grupo de cazavampiros que son asesinados por el master de los vampiros, que hace 600 años que sta vivo y fue el primer hereje de la iglesia. Los unicos que sobreviven son el jefe y su ayudante, aparte de una prostituta que forma pareja con este último. Ellos deberan matar al vampiro antes de que tome el poder de vivir a la luz del sol."
1,"Based on John Carpenter's Vampires? I DON""T think so!!!","John Carpenter's Vampires is one of the best Vampire books I've read. I was utterly disgusted by what they did to it! Don't watch this movie if you've read the book! Like so many book adaptations, They took the title, the main charactors, the basic story ""hook"" and threw away the rest (99% of the original story). Trust me, Don't waste your money by even renting this movie with a bunch of friends. It's not even worth 50 cents. READ THE BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Outstanding soundtrack saves unoriginal schlock gorefest.,"Please, JC, release the soundtrack on CD! The 5-star music just manages to save an average horror flick. It's simply not scary. Anyone who liked this vid would be gobsmacked by ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" -- same genre, much better and an equally brilliant s/track."
3,"What to say, what to say...","I saw this movie for the first time not becasue I like John Carpenter but becasue it is a Vampire story. The story itself was fairly interesting and I think that any vampire fan would enjoy this movie very much.***A WARNING***While I said that this movie is good, it is also VERY, VERY GORY. I had read that people who saw the movie ""Blade"" thought it was the goriest thing they have seen in their lifetime. I thought that the gore in ""Blade"" was absolutely nothing. This movie is something, trust me. This movie has everything, decapitations, neck-breaking, bisections and MUCH MUCH more all the while the blood is spewing. So please keep this in mind before you view this movie."
1,Lame,The story was a string of cliches. The characters dull and cardboard flat. The photography colorful but unengaging. This movie was a total waste of time. Don't add insult to injury by wasting your money.
1,Don't waste your time!,"This movie isn't worth the film it's shot on. Boring, boring, boring. John Carpenter has gone to the absolute bottom of the barrel for this one. Ever go to the movies and within the first fifteen minutes, just wish it would end? If that's what gets you off, then buy this DVD."
1,Quite simply awful,"I was completely surprised by how awful Vampires was. It's aJohn Carpenter film, a man who knows how to direct action sequencesand scary jump-in-your seat shocks. It's unfortunate that Vampires was a complete bust, an extremely unscary movie that never hits on the right note on whether it wants to be funny or scary. The result is that it's never either one for a moment. Only thing worth noting about this film is James Woods fun performance."
2,Fullscreen? Seriously?,"It blows my mind that that you can't get a widescreen version of this film that also has the commentary by diector John Carpenter. JS is well known for his widescreen compositions and his informative and entertaining DVD commentaries. BUT in order to get both you'd have to run the featureless Superbit dvd in your player while simultaneously playing the sound from the ""standard"" dvd on another TV. Absolutely astonishing that in the past 14 years there has been no upgrade to this work by a major genre filmmaker!"
4,Predictably Routine.,The movie is really predictable & the action scenes are almost standard stock. The vampires bursting into flame in daylight is hardly beliveable. But the movie does help in passing the time. Most likable for a Halloween night horror marathon featuring vampires & werewolves.
4,Decent,"This was a good horror film, and some interesting takes on the vampire genre. It certainly had a few moments of cheese, but Carpenter is a great director even when he is not getting it all right. Staying more true to the book by John Steakley would have helped. Still, lots of good actors with a good director makes this worth watching."
2,James Woods in Scooby Doo adventure,"For an actor who has appeared in quality productions such as Salvador, The Onion Field, Once Upon A Time In America and Casino, James Woods seems less than choosy with some of his other roles. John Carpenter's Vampires is a prime example of this. The film cannot be taken seriously on any level - it makes that clear from the outset, so at least avoids cheating the viewer. Woods copes well with the physically-demanding role but it's difficult to figure out exactly what is supposed to sell this movie. Humour is evident throughout, mainly featuring one-liners from Woods. The supporting cast are adequate but most of the viewer's time may well be spent wondering how many of the vampires got their start in the infinitely better produced Michael Jackson's Thriller music video. I'm sure the plot has also featured in at least one Scooby Doo cartoon, possibly to greater effect."
4,FUN!!!!!!!!!!!!!,There us only 1 word to describe this movie and that is FUN. This film is wicked!. I had friends over to watch this film and we were all laughing and screaming our heads off!!!!!!!!!!! BUY IT NOW!!!
3,action packed...good effects,"the head vampire in this movie is very good looking...that's what made me pay such close attention to it! the Whole stake in the heart thing to a 600 year old vampire was kinda weak though;in all actuality, valek could've stomped everyone's ass...it was severly lacking in reality and antagonizes vampires who are actually quite captivating"
4,the confliction between the idea and the director,"In fact I expected this film to be more bewitching but unfortunately I could not say: two thumbs up because the main idea was a bit ludicrous. Over all, this was one of the good and tempered films that I have seen. The most important reason for this idea is of course its director: J.Carpenter."
4,"Good, Gory Fun!","I like James Woods and I like Vampire movies and this film is very good. Lots of blood and gore fill this tale about a mercenary hired by the Vatican to eradicate vampires. Things go wrong, of course, when the vampire hunter gets set up to become a snack for a group of particularly vicious blood-suckers. Action-packed and entertaining all the way through."
5,John Carpenter strikes again!,"This film was the best vampire movie I ever saw in my whole life.I hate the scene at that party when the priest gets killed in front of your eyes.The master vampire makes Dracula look [bad].This movie really scared me.That Hooker girl,dame she is hot but I better not tell you she becomes UNDEAD!Jack(James Woods)who is the leader of a club who kills vampires.I am telling you once you have seen JOHN CARPENTER's VAMPIRES you'll never forget it.Even if you are undead.It is just a movie right?Ages 13 and up can see this do to violence and bloody battles,language,adult content,and nudity."
3,Best from Carpenter in a decade... not saying much,"Could have been worse-- a lot worse, given how far down Carpenter has slid since They Live. In fact, this is the first really decent piece of filmmaking I've seen from Carpenter in the last decade. James Woods and Daniel Baldwin work well together as the buddy-good-guys who aren't actually buddies (they love each other, but don't really like each other--- you know how that goes), Maximillian Schell is appropriately creepy as a higher-up in the Catholic church, Sheryl Lee makes a great hooker (assuming her role is supposed to be played as unsympathetically as it is, of course), and the action only stops long enough for you to draw a breath before it starts again. Not the best of the films we rented in the past week, but worthwhile, and a good deal of fun."
4,"Not deep, but fast moving and fun","This is a very enjoyable movie with one of the better horror/action movie intros I've seen. The movie keeps up a tense and very violent pace throughout and while you're never pondering any deeper issues through this movie it's a good bet this flick is at least keeping you on your toes. The ending was set up to be pretty good but I couldn't help but feel a little cheated by how easily the Vampire Lord was disposed of, especially after his rather gross introduction at the beginning of the film. It may not be for everyone but it's at least worth a look."
5,Another Great Movie by John Carpenter,"I am a big fan of John Carpenter's directing skills, and I collect vampire movies too. This one is among my top five. I really like the plot and the action. I hadn't thought that I liked James Wood, but he did an excellent job. If you want something other than the Hammer series - not that they are too bad - try Blade, Vampire 2000, Dusk til Dawn."
4,John Carpenter's VAMPIRES,"VAMPIRES, a film by horror master John Carpenter, tells the story of Jack Crowe, a man in charge of a team of vampire exterminators that travel throughout the country, killing bloodsucking vampires for the Catholic church. Jack's newest mission is to stop a 'master vampire' named Valek from getting his hands on a cross that will allow all vampires to walk in the sunlight and become more powerful than they already are. This film has action, horror, suspense, humor, and nudity --- everything that makes a John Carpenter film a classic! James Woods also gives an excellent performance as Jack Crowe, the tough-guy vampire killer who shows no mercy!"
3,"Silly, but kind of fun . . .","A high-tech vampire flick, directed with flair, and enough gore to fill the ocean. It's mostly cursed, however, by unsympathetic characters and that unfogivable part about the cardinal. Otherwise silly, but John Carpenter makes it fun. Gore misters should get their share here."
1,I can't believe I paid retail to see it in theaters!!!,"Where to start, where to start... Bad writing and even worse acting. The only good point was the general storyline was interesting, but it was so poorly executed that I can't even give it points for that. My advice...wait till you can see it for free!!!"
3,SO IT WASN'T ALL-THAT,"Okay I couldnt wait to watch the movie so I rented it.... It is an all right movie but why did they have to take a line out of INTERVIEW WITH A VAMPIRE...(now that my friends kicks a**) anyway yes it does, at one part the main mean guy is talking to James Wood and says something to the effect of "" He knows of no miracles"" something like that... it is basically the same thing Armond says to Luey when Luey asks who is the one who started it all (a.k.a the vampire) and what the meaning to it all is. Of course I will buy this movie when the price goes down... why? you ask? well thats because I'm a ""sucker"" for vampire flix (get it... sucker.....) All in all everything could have been better but the one thing that could have been improved more is the fact that they kill the vampires to fast, and the vampires kill the humans to fast there is no struggle!!!! It was to easy!!!! Thought I'd share my thoughts but you'll have to judge for yourself....."
4,This movie is OK but...........,I think blade was a whole lot better.If you gave Wesley Snipes those guns in vampie.....dang!!! Jack Crow and blade would make an awesome team!!!!!!!!The vampires in vampires looked a whole lot more you know mean!!!!!!
2,Why me...? Why did this have to happen...?!,"I've heard some people say this movie either ruled or sucked. While it had some really cool parts, I think the only thing this vampire movie lacked was that they killed off the vampires way too fast. We didn't get a long fighting scene much like From Dusk Till Dawn. Hence, this movie pretty much sucked."
1,1 star for Valek,"I must admit that I was captivated by Valek, and his quest to find the Berziers Cross. The idea of a vampire surviving in the daylight wasn't bad either.However, I found the acting and the plot to be mediocre. Lets give some credit to the vampires, especially to Valek : Jack could have never survived their first encounter. How is it that he is not only able to survive, but also able to defeat the vampires? It seems to be a weak plot: 2 slayers and a priest, able to destroy vampires of such strenght. Can someone explain to me, why it took the vampires so long to get into safety? Why would Valek take refugge in a place where he would be easily killed?As for our hero Jack, I must admit I was digusted by his character and his story, from begining to end. I also never understood, why Katrina laid naked in bed, or why she was punched and pushed around."
2,Great movie !,I thought I was getting a DVD and this was not one. Double check before you order. Great movie though !
1,"If there were a lower rating, I'd give it.","One of the (unintentionally) worst movies I've ever seen. The absence of plot, poor acting, bad directing, bad dialogue, bad EVERYTHING make this one unbearable. Sure, the movie gave me nightmares, but not ones of vampires and ghouls, no, rather ones in which I was to blame for this crapfest, sinking deep into a spiral of depression and turning to alcoholism...I can only Imagine what John Carpenter must feel like after every keeps telling him how this movie sucked.You want vampires?Watch From Dusk 'til dawn (1&3....2 wasnt very good.), Shadow of the Vampire, Bram Stokers Dracula, Blade..... but by all means, DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!"
1,My God this movie blew,I don't give out one star reviews lightly but this one merited it. The heroes of the film were completely unlikable as spent most of their time beating up a half conscious girl and freaking out at each other for no reason. This could have been saved if the actual vampires had been decent. They weren't. They were almost as easy to kill as the Dusk Till Dawn crew and had no personality whatsoever. If the director was going to go for the completely brutal and animalistic tyoe for them this would have worked but it was sort of an uncomfortable medium throughout. The head vampire was especially lackluster.
1,If it was possible....,"I would give this movie -100 stars.I can't believe that people have given this movie such a high rating. This is possibly the worst movie ever made in the whole history of man. James Wood as a leather clad gun toting vampire hunter is laughable at best. Daniel Baldwin needs to lose some weight. And the vampires seriously need a bath. Blaaaaah! That's all I can say...and that I seriously wanted to slice my wrists when I watched it on its opening day, Halloween 2000 (I believe). Oh god, why did I watch the whole thing? I guess I like punishment, I guess. Don't watch unless you want every intellectual thought ripped out of your head."
1,Don't waste your money . . .,"This movie is an extremely disappointing effort by Carpenter. Acting is bad, script is bad, plot is bad, music score written by Carpenter is bad. Could not watch to the end!"
5,LOVE IT!!!!!!!,"IF YOU LIKE VAMPIRE MOVIES, THIS IS FOR YOU. PLENTY OF SEXY SCENES FOR THE GUYS AND SIT ON THE EDGE OF YOUR SEAT HORROR. NOT TOO SCARY, BUT JUST ENOUGH TO MAKE YOU WANT TO KEEP STAKES AROUND....."
1,"Ouch, my poor eyes!",This was by far the worst Vampire move ever made. I am surprised that John Carpenter would be so broke as to put his name within 1000 miles of this film.
1,weak story and annoying characters,"I was hoping for a lot more. James Wood was so unlikable that I was rooting for the vampires. Wesley Snipes presented a much more balanced hard-ass character in Blade. If Woods and Baldwin's characters weren't such jerks to everyone, I'd characterize their treatment of Sheryl Lee as misogyny; instead I'll just call it offensive."
2,not the best thing I have bought,"This bracelet is technically what it is sold as. There were 2 tiny diamonds on the one I received and it took me forever to find them. The sapphires are very included. It does not look bad on the wrist and if you don't plan to have people looking at it too closely it is fine. It does have a nice over all look when being worn. The silver work is good, heavy enough to wear often. The clasp is really nice and has a safety catch."
3,"Its OK, but a bit clunky to use on a victorian","I have a brick victorian home with lots of wooden architectural details that need to be painted.Already mentioned in a previous review is that you cannot edit polygons once they are created. This a little annoying at first, but once you know it its easy enough to zoom in and make sure its just right before finalizing it.My main issue with the tool is that I have not yet found an easy way to copy a paint color/transparency/brightness/etc fromm one layer to another. I have to pick the color for each layer manually. This makes it take longer to match up the colors that I want to be the same, as I am still trying to determine if the trim should have 2, 3, or even 4 colors."
3,cute..but not very effective,"This is an adorable item and it fits my large dog well. HOWEVER, I did not feel that it worked as it should. I followed the directions and it was sort of cool for a little while- but not for long (less than an hour) and basically had no affect on cooling down my hot dog on a 90-degree day. I tried it on myself to test it out and it feels like a wet rag around my neck- after not too long a warm wet rag."
3,Not as funny as expected,"This book was an interesting read. I was hoping for more humorous stories, but they were entertaining enough for our purposes, which was to jumpstart conversation in our Bible study on the topics covered. Don't know that I'd necessarily recommend the book, though."
3,A best seller in the forties....,"This Above All is one of my favorite movies from the forties, and I have seen it many times. However, I had not read the book until now. The movie contains the best elements of the story, whereas the book tends to drag on a bit. If I had read it before seeing the movie, I might have been more impressed."
4,Gong - 'Floating Anarchy Live 1977' (Spalax)import CD,"This fabulous record was recorded at a festival gig in 1977 with what was(at the time)the very last ever performance of the original line-up of Gong.Must admit that 'Floating...' is just such a FUN disc to listen to.I was impressed with the way out intro ""Psychological Overture"" and ""Stone Innoc Frankenstein"".The only tune I recognized right off hand was Daevid Allen's ""Opium For The People"" where one can truly experience the guru's silliness.The closing song is worth the admission price itself.It's a fifteen minute epic that MUST be heard to be believed,""Allez Ali Baba Black Sheep Have You Any Bull Sh*t:Mama Maya Mantram"".Yes,this REALLY is a song title.A must have for all fans of cosmic,hippie and jam rock."
4,my perspective as artist,"Well....I might be a little bias because I'm on the damn album, but here it goes....I'll try to be objective.I feel FIREPIT is a great second album.....however, it could have been better. But I'd rather focus on the positive....I think the originals on this album surpass the originals on VOYAGE TO THE PALACE OF KALI.Uncle Al, as well as the 3 I wrote:""As good as you"", ""The fool"" and 'get out of my sight"" hold up well......in retrospect I suppose we shouldn't have done ""as good as you"" as a swing tune...being that the swing scene died just as the record was released, but hey....so what.It's still fun.......and that's what music should be about."
3,Buy the first one instead,"Voyage to the Palace of Kali is nonstop great ska. This one was a disappointment in comparison. Voyage to the Palace of Kali has been on my CD changer for years, it is so great. This one I barely listened to 5 times. Spider Nick is great, hope they come out with a new album like Voyage to the Palace of Kali!"
4,energitic,"Filled with great horn lines, a tight rhythm section, and driving drums ! There is a lot of energy in this band and it is clearly displayed in this particular recording. It is a nice step up from the bands first release. I particularly enjoyed the drum fills at the end of the songs."
4,A Christmas Carol--Illustrated Classic Edition,This book was all I expected and more. My children enjoyed reading the book and the illustrations were splendid. It is what the younger children can enjoy and want to finish before Christmas. Easy reading. It helped my children learn to be genereous and to see some good in all people. They have decided they do not want to be like Scrooge.
3,Not ready out of the box,"This does not come with a power supply. It has a BNC connector you will need adapters if you are planning on using it with an AV monitor or DVR that does not accept BNC. Wire leads coming off the camera are short, you will need an extension cable. Nice camera. They do sell it on Amazon with a power supply and extension wire."
5,The real deal,"This CD puts you at an up-close table and you can practically smell the cigarette smoke and dried beer on the carpet. Billy Joe is backed by a 3-piece rock trio (not to be confused with a country band) led by the late Eddy Shaver on guitar. Besides the tremendous songwriting, it's Eddy's guitar work that super charged the band's live performances during this era. His homegrown creativity of blending styles and tones is powerfully evident throughout this live CD. Billy Joe's resume is packed with songwriting credits affiliated with many Nashville artists, although his own presentation style of these songs is far removed from Nashville and sits right in the heart of a Texas honky tonk. If you can't stand the way Nashville does it, boy have I got the CD for you!"
3,"It's a little bit Country, and a whole lot Southern Rock","If you're into that, then you will be happy. I saw Billy Joe Shaver at Twangfest '02 and thought he was fantastic. This was due to his incredible talent, and the fact he was not backed by Lynard Skynard. I did not realize that's what I would be getting on this disc (not that there's anything wrong with Skynard). My error."
2,Difficult To Use,"I am sorry to say that I had to send the product back as I could never get the software to load properly. I was not able to sync the PDA.I will definately give the vendor lots of ""cudos"" as he spent lots of time thru e-mails and really worked with me to try to get it working.He was really great to work with and when I did have to return it, he took care of the return promptly.Too bad the product didn't work for me. Thanks, Pg"
4,Nice little item,"I bought one of these a couple of months ago - so I can't attest to the durability of these units yet.But - I can say that the SJ-20 makes a perfect little portable ebook reader - the screen is sharp with nice backlighting, and I really like the little jog wheel for one-handed operation. Nice design.I charge the batteries when I'm not using it - and have never had the battery run out on me.I do have problems with synchronization sometimes. You really have to make sure that everything is firmly and tightly connected, otherwise things seem to hang occasionally.I don't like the direction Sony is going with the SJ-33. The hard flip-top seems annoying. I prefer the soft flip cover of the SJ-20. So pick up an SJ-20 before Sony starts messing too much with the design."
3,"Nice implimentation, but not durable","The sony is a great design. Easy to us, and the jog dial works great. However, the unit is not durable. I had previously had a Palm III for 2 1/2 years (when the screen shattered). This unit lasted 8 months before the data entry module malfunctioned."
5,A great first PDA,"I am enjoying using my Clie, and am 100% happy with it. It's very small and light, with a bright screen (much brighter than the SJ10, which uses regular batteries rather than the rechargebable lithium unit the SJ20 has). It comes with all the software you need to sync with Outlook for Windows (including email), and even with a Mac (I have an iMac with Mac OS 10.1.5). It also comes with software allowing you to view and edit Word and Excel documents. It doesn't come with a cradle, but a cable instead --- no big deal. At this kind of price, you can get loads of use out of it for a year or two, then upgrade. And there's no need to be precious about it either, as I would be with a unit costing twice as much."
4,"Superb res, reliable and versatile","I bought mine refurb and after 2-yrs I'm still in love with my SJ20. Although it sometimes fails and auto resets, of all of my gadgets it's by far my best companion at the point I depend on it. Sony's decision of quittin' the PDA business was annoying, I have to say, but my loyalty to Clié remains intact, so whenever somebody asks me for a recommendation on PDAs I always suggest Sony Clié. Right now I'm looking for an upgrade, which shall be a TJ27 (the one that comes with built-in camera), and my beloved SJ20 will remain close to me in my fianceé's hands."
1,warning!,"After owning 3 Palms and one Pocket PC (... I kept dropping them), I bought but deeply regret buying a Clie. If you are a heavy user of ""tasks"" as I am, Clie's performance is so bad the PDA is unusable. When one makes any change in the task (...change date to ""tomorrow""), there is about a 5 second delay. For all the Palms this was instantaneous. Change ""priority""... same thing. Etc. This renders the Clie unusable.I will not complain about the fact the machine just flat stopped working after a month of use because I sent it in and they fixed it for free and quickly. I pointed out the above problem but they did nothing.This really disappointed me as I had previously thought well of Sony."
1,This is the worst PDA I have owned,"DON'T believe the hype. I am pretty techno-savy and this unit did not do what it claims to do. The hot-synch did not work properly, the battery had below average life, difficult to reset, poor help files. Oh, did I mention, Sony never sent me the rebate they promised."
4,Great PDA Great price.,"The Clie SJ20 is a great PDA. It opperates quickly and efficiently. The backlight is great and provides a perfect view of the screen. The unit fits in your hand very well. It is just the right weight and size. The one problem that I find is that the screen is fairly hard to see w/o the backlight on, unless it is under direct light. Every other feature and item of software included with this PDA are excellent. For the price and features the SJ20 is a great buy."
2,Another Cracked Screen,"Great basic PDA except for one thing, the screen cracked with very little contact, and it no longer works. I have seen this same comment from many others as well. Sony service is non-existant. Be prepared to baby this thing if you buy it."
3,Beginning of the commercial Roxette,"When I was reading the annunce of this album I begun crying: NO! NOT THE ROXETTE! MONEY COULD CHANGE EVERYTHING BUT NOT THE ROXETTE! I was hopening in the new album( ""Have a nice day"" ) but now that i've listened it I think that I've lost the old Roxette. This album is a stupid, horrible, commercial operation. Nothing else. The latin music sell very well in all the world and the Roxette had maked moneys without working very much. I don't believe in a music maded in that way. This album confirm what I'm thinking: words are changed and the songs lost the original significate( I'm italian, I can understand a lot of spanish ). Commercial operation, nothing else."
5,real romantic,"This is one of my favorite albums of all time. All the songs are fantastic, and it's real great to put on this album to get into a romantic mood."
5,Best album by Roxette,"This really sounds great! Songs in Spanish are much better, more romantic and harmonic"
3,Rather Disappointing,"As a long time student of military rifle shooting, I looked forward to finally obtaining a copy of this book. After reading it I am disappointed. As the reviewer below states, author C. Shore gives a respectable account of various small arms used during the Second World War. But his work is sadly lacking with respect to the actual British sniper in western Europe. One is left with the notion that the author was a serious firearms enthusiast who missed most of the fighting and tried his best to make up for it in this book. It pales in comparison to Herbert McBride's ""A Rifleman Went to War"" and ""The Emma Gees."""
3,general coverage,"I became interested in this book when it was mentioned in the American Rifleman. The issue covered the Lee-Enfield No.4(T). Unfortunately, the magazine article was the more interesting of the two. I have not read much on the British snipers, so the book sounded interesting. The writing is conversational and a bit wordy, similar the other books from the same time frame, and could have used more editing. I would have preferred more actual experiences of snipers vs an equipment list of various armies."
5,Even better than Maybelline Great Lash,"For years my favorite mascara was Maybelline Great Lash but I tried this mascara and found a new favorite! The L'Oreal brush is nicer and gives you more coverage and I could visibly see the difference in how my lashes looked. My lashes curled up nicely and I could see that they looked prettier, fuller and longer with this mascara then the Maybelline Great Lash. Maybelline is still a great mascara but this L'Oreal mascara is the one for me from now on. It's fantastic!"
3,Just ok.,This mascara was a tad dissappointing. It fans the lashes out nicely but did not add very much to them.
5,Great Books...,I bought two of the Encyclopedia Brown books for my granddaughter for Christmas. She loves them and I know she'll enjoy reading these two also.
3,Mixing fun with duties,"Like a ""My Man ( Mon homme )"", this story is focused on a sex-worker trying to change a life in her forties.High educated, Geisha-style-providing service female succeeded with a help of psychiatrists."
3,"""Just Okay"" Huppert Film + comment on bonus features","My fellow Amazon reviewer K. Harris has provided enough detail about this film - and thoughtfully - did not give away the ending. I concur 100% with K that, while Huppert is the reason to see the film, it's the writer/director's fault that the film doesn't gel.One thing not pointed out yet is the DVD includes an ""Interview"" with Director Jeanne Labrune, which is a TEXT interview about the film and it's characters. In some screens the print may be a bit small to read. Labrunne comes across - at least for me - as defensive in her feelings re: Psychoanalysts and the fees they charge.I hope this adds some helpful information.Steve Ramm""Anything Phonographic"""
5,Great,"I love this show, I wish it was still on the air. My kids and I watch this dvd set as much as we can, we never get tired of it"
5,According to Jim Season 2,Funny for the whole Family - a little bit naughty and 100% Jim - sometimes you wish you had the guts to say the things he does!! So if you want something to simply entertain you - this is the show.
3,Not 100% pleased,"Love the show, but this set of DVD's did NOT come with a list of the episodes (series sets usually come with a list of what's on the discs). Was this omission an accident or a way of saving a few pennies?"
4,almost as durable as an NOS mullard,"JJ electron tubes are among the most durable in the business.While a rectifier tube provides no change in the tone of an amp(only a solid state rectifier will slightly change the tone)because it is not in the signal path whatsoever,it's purpose is to convert the alternating current to direct current in the amp's filaments.So all that really matters is how long the tube will last and how inexpensive it is,and JJ is the most bang for the buck. I see no logic in spending 100 dollars for an NOS tube which will provide no change in tone whatsoever but possibly last slightly longer(or not)when 100 dollars worth of these tube will most likely last longer than any tube amp on the planet.solid state rectifiers only reduce the voltage sag which takes away some of the amps bass and response while tube rectifiers make the amp more touch sensitive."
1,Do not work effectively against german cockroach.,"It was waste of money and time. 3rd party seller, ACE hardware, took 10 days to deliver.It is not effective against german cockroaches. I found another product that kills instantly."
3,Saddie still has fleas,"Applied product, but our black lab Saddie is still itching and we still see fleas on her. Not sure what we think of this as of yet."
2,"balderdash, lucid",Feminist icon Angela Davis goes way out of her depth by claiming that the American women's suffrage movement itself was racist. The evidence she cites has no currency with historians of women's suffrage or of 19th century America. Her analysis of the current women's movement rests on much stronger ground.
1,DISAPPOINTED W AMAZON SERVICE,"Received book in good condition, expeditiously. However, order was botched with extra copies of this book and another book that was ordered. Experienced great difficulty when initially placing order and as of this date, was never resolved costing me additional monies for items I did not need. AMAZON is too big for its britches. I will never use again,nor recommend to my children, friends, relatives, and schoolmates."
5,Feminist Movement,"If you are concerned about thedirection of the feminist movementin this country then, by all means add this book to your collection. Angela Davis is without equals in terms of herwriting. She examines the exploitation of the black womantracing the oppression back toslavery. If you havent already becomefamiliar with the writings ofAngela Davis. She is last greaticon of the black liberationmovement."
2,Missing key scenes from novel The Magic Mountain,"This two disk / 2 part version is lousy. It misses some key scenes including the important scene in the snow and also the Settermbrini & Naphta's discussions, both key to plot of the novel. These scenes were shown in the 2 disk 3 part earlier film version. Also, Joachim seems to randomly die at the start of disk 2 for no reason. And the casting of Clavdia is questionable, as she does not appear to the gorgeous siren she's depicted as in the novel or in the earlier 3 part film version. And the casting of Hans is also questionable, as he looks like he is 17 instead of 24. Book > this movie version. 2 out of 5 stars. Disappointing."
5,Be RED or be dead,This is a must have for any true Devil fan. It is packed with historical info and pics. It also has a video stadium tour that is pretty cool. The game is a lot of fun when combined with a controller(keyboard begins to hurt your wrist). You can also create a player to put on the squad and build up so its got replay value. Loads of fun
5,The Ink of Heaven,"THE INK OF HEAVEN will truly touch the depths of your soul! You will laugh, then you will cry as each story and poem is read because this author makes you feel like she wrote each one just for you and your situation. The more you read, the more you want to read this book! It's so compelling that you can't put it down! I have been blessed over and over again by it's contents. There are many favorites, but my most favorite is ""TEARS"". GOD'S anointing is truly upon THE INK OF HEAVEN and CHAR B BRANCH. This is most apparent after reading the first story!This is one book you should buy several at one time to share with friends and family because once you read it, you won't want to loan out to anyone. (Trust me, people will want to borrow it after just reading the first few pages!) Don't miss out on the blessing you will receive in reading this book...Buy it today...Buy one for yourself and one for a friend!"
5,Incredible,"I loved this series. It allows the viewer to go deeply inside the Holocaust. The hidden camera footage of former Nazis was incredible, and I do not recall having seen anything like that anywhere else. I have watched the series in its entirety 4 times. There are just so many compelling stories. I have read some of the other reviews and I was touched by the one about the Polish underground. I would like to have seen more on that aspect. I do agree that Lanzmann focused on poor and uneducated Poles. He really should have balanced it by showing the incredible Nazi brutality toward Poles. Auschwitz was, after all, first used to house, torture and work to death Polish ""political"" prisoners. Poles were summarily executed with incredible frequency. They, too, were considered subhuman by the Nazi beasts. There needs to be a serious effort to lay open that aspect of Polish history."
5,The most important film I have ever seen,"I saw this film when it first aired on PBS some time in the 1980s. I think it is the most important film ever made - I have felt that way since I first saw it, and that opinion has never changed. It is simply the most important film ever made. At first, I did not think I would make the time commitment (shown over several evenings), but once I started watching, I just couldn't wait to get home from work each evening to see it. And I let nothing interrupt it.It is the most important film ever made. See it, and you will know why I say this."
5,Against Schindler's List,"An extremeley important film, both for memory and film history. Lanzmann once said that if he discovered a visual document about holocaust he would destroy it. Seeing Shoah, we understand why, and also the immense difference between film and a tv chronicle"
5,"Powerful, devastating testimony","I saw Shoah on PBS around the mid-80's and have never forgotten the experience. The documentary was shown in weekly installments. At first, I was just curious, but then I was drawn by the powerful testimony I was witnessing. I remember that while watching the last installments, I was weeping over the depravity and evil that was discussed by the aged survivors. At that time I was a Staff Sergeant with 15 years military service. We are tempted to turn away from the horrendous images and ignore the Holocaust as an anomaly or as something best left in the past. We want to move on. But listening to the stories and watching the faces of the survivors I knew that I must listen very carefully. I must not miss one moment of their testimony. Neither can you. Listen, watch, and learn what evil men can do to fellow man. It's a long, long film but it must be seen in its entirety."
5,A Documentary of Immense Power,"Lanzmann has fashioned a documentary that should be required viewing in every modern European history class, despite its length. Eschewing archival footage from the '30s and '40s, Lanzmann presents the slaughter of European Jewry through the testimony of the survivors ... surviving inmates, surviving guards ... even surviving neighbors of Auschwitz, who claim to have been unsure just WHAT was going on. For me, the most affecting interview is that with the Jewish Auschwitz barber who tells of how, in a period of 10 minutes, he silently shaved the heads of his wife, best friend and best friend's wife just prior to them being gassed ... none saying a word, so the barber can survive and offer his testimony. I wish I could give this film SIX stars ..."
1,Q:How can you tell if a big dinosaur film's due out soon?,"I haven't ever seen the original Land of the Lost series, but I can only assume it's better than this. Dodgy puppets, contemptable know-all kids, a cliched cavewoman and people in unconvincing costumes all battle to make this series one to forget. It was all obviously no more than a cash-in on the then soon-to-be-released Jurassic Park anyway. These two episodes, as if anyone gives a pedipalp, include a volcano, the green(!) larva of which is stopped by magic, and a rather pathetic 'knight', who looks about twelve and quite obviously isn't a real knight. There are a few good scenes, but overall this is aimed strictly at undemanding kids, and as they'll just laugh at the feeble special effects after seeing Jurassic Park what exactly is the point of this?"
4,nice growth chart,Pretty picture that is fun to use. Also a nice height. Has lasted well for the past 4 years. Only problem is that there are several seams - if you put a sticker across these eventually the sticker breaks in half even with little movement.
5,Very cute,"This is a super cute growth chart for little girls. I bought it as a gift, and I'm sure she will love it. Comes in a little cute box so it's easy to wrap."
3,"It Works, but Don't Expect Top Quality","This hex socket is made in U.S.A., but the quality is more like a typical cheap asian made products. I bought it for oil change on Mazda. I did some alterations to make it better. Last words, it works but that is it."
4,Life and Love and Property in the South of France,"I liked this book a lot. But a poor title, which does not reflect the scope of the story. I wish the author had been a bit more specific. For example: Date of the story? Did she ever marry Michel and why/why not? All told, it is a lovely memoir -- not of a couple either retired or wealthy enough who go to live out a dream -- but two working people, artistes (as their neighbors notice!), who sacrifice to have this old ruin and its surrounding lands all the while trying to accommodate his children, her parents and their respective careers. I enjoyed it a lot more than Mayles, who always seems so pretentious."
4,"The Olive Farm: A Memoir of Life, Love, and Olive Oil in the South of France","Ms Drinkwater writes a uncomplicated and enjoyable tale of her adventures in old houses,the French, olive oil and love. She brings the same pleasantness to the written word that she did to the small screen in All Creatures Great and Small."
4,a delightful book,I have read quite a few books of this type and it is right up there with the best of them.
5,"Lovely ""picture"" of the south of France","Having enjoyed Carol Drinkwater so much in ""All creatures great and small"", I was delighted to discover that she is an author. It is amazing to learn how she transformed a desolate old house in the French countryside into the beautiful centerpiece to a working olive farm."
3,Drippy,"For me, this book has too much information about the problems of being a stepmother in the television business, making arrangements in France and botanical details of the olive and not enough about France or French people."
5,Good product,I bought this for my daughter and she was very happy with it. It's new and just like the add said I was very pleased with there service and product.
1,Couldn't work as it promised,This is not fitting the viola and is basically useless. Returning it is a hassle. Don't buy this product. I'd prefer to go to a music store and buy it.
4,Nice collection of anomalies,"Stranger than Science is a nice little collection of anomalies. In more than 70 very short chapters Edwards mentions a huge number of unexplained phenomena from unexplained archaeological evidence to dreams that inspired inventors in their sleep.This is probably the only pseudo science I read as a child that is worth rereading now. Edwards has a writing style that is conversational and easy to read. Much of what he is saying is just thrown out there, but it is easy to sort out the rumors from the more backed up assertions. Sometimes he simply reminds us of oddities, like the inspirational dreams, that don't shake the world view but are good stories to tell. By the way there is no bibliography or index.This is worth a read if you are interested in unexplained phenomena. It is sort of an organized conversational laundry list of the weird."
2,NOT for the kids,"This book...which was passed around my school class in the 1960's...is full of ghost stories, tales of maybe-monsters and odd happenings. It scared us all silly, because we were unable to separate fact from fiction. In those days, there were no CSICOP organizations running around saving the credulous from themselves, so there was no one to tell us that most of the tales were urban legends and just plain bunk!Read this for entertainment.Keep it away from the little kids."
4,i haven't really read the book but my friend says its great,i haven't really read this book but my friend tells me its grea
1,"How to play Jimi Hendrix, Axis BoldAs Love The Complete GuitarDVD","Teacher, in the DVD shows how he knows how to play Little Wing instead of demo step by step how to pick the correct notes and figure positions, and the strumming technique. YouTube has clips that contain step by step demos. Strongly not recommend buying it.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001QIVER8/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title"
1,Excellent Content; Dismal Edition,"The publishers of this edition should be ashamed of themselves. The quality of this edition of Keynes' Essays In Persuasion is poor to say the least.There are numerous typos.The text is not justified properly; some words hang off lines, and there are irregular and gigantic spaces between words.The table of contents is missing numbers.There is no introduction to the author or the material.The page numbers are inversed.This is a low-quality, junior-high school effort edition, unworthy of the material it professes to have ""beautifully produced."" This edition is poorly edited.Reading Essays In Persuasion is certainly worthy of your time, but this edition is not worthy of your money."
2,Prints not properly aligned in the pages and sometimes missing,"I am not very happy with the book as the letters/print is not properly aligned on the pages. In fact, at some places it is so close to the margin that it feels that letters are missing."
1,Outdated,It's my fault. I should have checked it out more before I bought it.The information on these cassetes are a bit outdated. Some of it is interesting if you haven't heard it before.He comes across as a pastor speaking in his church. It is long and didn't hold my interest. I sold it at a yard sale.
3,"Love the bra, disappointed with durability","I really, really love this bra. It is one of the most supportive bras I have ever owned, which is impressive considering it is a nursing bra! However, my baby is 9 months old and I have bought two of these bras and both have had the wires poke through. Now I don't hand wash them like you are supposed to (what nursing mother has time to hand wash her bras???) but I wash them in a Tide Bra Bag which keeps them from getting tangled and mangled in the wash. For $50 I am pretty disappointed that they have worn out so fast, especially since I don't wear it every day, only when I go out or go to work. I will probably buy another one, but only because I can't find another bra that fits."
4,Good content; currently being updated. Great ideas.,"This textbook and reference work has great ideas and materials on the most relevant issues in dealing with these complex topics. Since this material becomes (partially) dated quickly, one might wish to wait for the new edition.Nevertheless, it makes a valuable contribution by covering extensively many of the major issues in this growing and rapidly changing field."
1,Disappointing,"Quite disappointing. Narrow in scope, and does not deal with many of the more important issues of the information age."
4,Good,well you obviously havent realized that essential mix wasnt his original music it was just remixes of others. So if you dont own or like his original cds like break to the dance vol 1 & 2 or generate. Which all 3 have lots of lyrics(most funky breaks do)dont judge his cds.
5,"Brilliant, and for a worthwhile cause","Let me start by saying I'm a smooth jazz fan. This album is just brilliant. Many different styles are here, from slow and peaceful, funk, fusion, latin, it's all here. The sounds are original and refreshing. Nothing is re-hashed. I can't tell you how much I enjoy listening to this album. The Rippington's Russ Freeman also helps out on the title track. If you go to David's website, you can read a little on the album's purpose and sad influence. Again, in a word, brilliant."
5,Refreshing Jazz,"I love this album. It has so many colors and flavors it is impossible to categorize. Yes, it's Jazz but then it's not. I love the fact that this artist has given the listener 14 original tunes instead of going cover crazy. However, the one cover tune he chose is amazing. Elton Johns' ""Don't let the sun go down on me"" It's the last track on the album. It is the best cover of it I have ever heard, truly a masterful arrangement.Every time I listen to it, the sound changes and I hear different instruments that I didn't think were there before. Do yourself a favor and wear headphones with this album it's a mental message.I'll report back on the other tracks later."
3,NOT VALE TUDO!!,"Let me say the production of this video is top notch. The moves are easily and clearly seen. HOWEVER, this is tournament-style jiu jitsu. 90% of the moves require you to 'pull guard'. This would just be asking for you to get your head kicked in real Vale Tudo/Pride fighting. The title is very misleading. NO STRIKING, minimal takedown training. Like I said, this video show some good tournament style jiu jitsu moves that require 'pulling guard'. I wouldn't recommend 90% of the moves be used in a vale tudo match."
1,Hideous!,"What the Marx Communist Manifesto is to the United States Constitution, this book is to human conciousness. ""Cybernetics"" itself is akin to doodling a moustache and eyebrows on the Mona Lisa. Reprehensible.If what's in this book isn't or wasn't more or less obvious in taking an ABET engineering degree, then one should have some self concern. Without misrepresentation, this book could be retitled ""Introduction to Phlogiston theory."" As with oxygen, the American Board of Engineering and Technology does exist."
2,Trilogy not thrilled,"All of these shorts star Denise Duff, and feature actors from the Bloodstone/Vampire Journals films.Unfortunately the connection is even closer. The last of these films ""Undead Evil"" is in fact a heavily edited version of ""Vampire Journals"" - they've shortened it to make it a 'new' feature.Judging by this, I would guess that the first film ""Spawn of Hell"" is also one - I haven't seen all the ""Bloodstone"" films, though.So, if you've seen the Bloodstone films, there's no point buying these 'new' films."
1,Minutes You Will Never Get Back,This trilogy appears to have been almost randomly created from the Subspecies Bloodstone movies. It makes no sense unless one has seen prior films.Kudos to the editor for the more than a minute long scene in the bedroom with the microphone hanging between the two actors. Even Ed Wood would have caught that one.
4,"Let me know, let me know","While Aaliyah didn't have a range as wide as Whitney Houston's or Mariah Carey's, she possessed a voice with such pure clarity. That's what made her remake of the Isley Brother's classic At Your Best (You Are Love) so beautiful. She didn't need any belts, runs, or whistles. Just a silky soul delivery that was as close to angelic as one can get. The Gangsta Child Remix was released as the video and radio version. There's a bit more music added to the mix that expands on the late night sensuality of the original. The repeated chants of ""let me know"" during the chorus are infectious. I'd steer clear of the Stepper's Ball Remix though. R. Kelly gets a few verses in and ruins the mood with his creepy ""stay awhile, child"" lines. Who can forget his shortlived illegal marriage to Aaliyah? How I wish I could. Anyway, let us never forget what a treasure Aaliyah's music was and will always be."
5,"Serious, dense, rewarding","Challenges the regular definitions of love not by replacing them with a new demonstration but by obliging the reader to ""see"" by means of the story how other, new, provocative concepts of loving can arise."
5,Dark Experimental Concrete,"Another great Recording by the mysterious avant-garde eyeball masked group The Residents. This needed bonus tracks, or maybe seperated into sections. overall an awesome jaw dropping expperience, in my opinion not their best, but overall extremely impressive!"
2,Bad choice for newcomers to the Residents!,"Don't be fooled! I know you're thinking, ""Well, I don't know, they sound like they're pretty weird, and this one is a bunch of covers of 60's pop songs that I already know, so...""No No NO!Let me explain. What's unusual about the Resdients is that they are unusual, NOT ugly. Their tunes are simple, accessible, and often quite beautiful. They are just oddly arranged.This album, believe it or not, is their LEAST accessible. They have made a collage of tiny shreds of many 60's pop songs, interspersed some vague Hitler references, and a hell of a lot of just plain noise. The result is angry, violent, unpleasant. Not like them in virtually any other recording. I can almost guarantee: if this is your first foray into this group, you won't be back. Try ""Not Available"", ""Duck Stab"", or the ""Commercial Album"" first!"
5,pointing & laughing at fascist pop media,"The Residents are awesome; this album is hilarious. They recorded their own musical tracks on top of top 20 hits, then took away the actual pop hit music, so what you're left with is just the bubblegum madness they re4corded over the hits. They also made a statement about the lack of individual worth of all these greatest hits by throwing them together into 2 long collages that are 2 epic ""songs"" made up of so many smaller ones without individual mention anywhere on this album that just kind of turn into one another without wsarning. This is my favorite Residents cd."
4,"Amusing, And Slightly Deep","The Residents by some accounts believed that rock and roll had been corrupted by big money - that it was precluding real artistic statement or rebellion, that it was opiate for the masses. Hence this album where they ridicule the form and tie it to notions of facism.The music consists of snippets of old rock songs, sung and played in ludicrous, ironic style. It's pretty funny."
4,Reflections,Great sound and clarity. Wonderful songs by Acker Bilk.A refreshing and relaxing mix of songs highlited by Stranger on the Shore.
3,A bit disappointed,I just bought this Uniden Tru8860 - charged it up the full amount of time required. It is a bit staticky and muffled. When I talked to a friend she could not hear all of my words and thought I was talking with a blanket over the speaker. Could not hear her that well either. The ring choices are a bit annoying and tinny sounding. I have put it back in the box and it is being returned tomorrow. My last Uniden which I had for several years was wonderful! Too bad the quality is not the same.
5,Excellent for beginners; useful for experienced quilters,"The book is very well organized. One can start a project or task from the book without reading the whole book -- every step is detailed and well illustrated. There are enough examples of useful items to encourage beginners, and to stimulate the more experienced quilter or fabric artist. It is delightful to the senses, and every fabric artist should have it."
2,A weak effort,"Can this be the same author who wrote the wonderful ""Range of Motion"" and ""The Pull of the Moon""? The characters in ""Say When"" are not well developed, especially the husband (WHY did he want Ellen back anyway?), and it had a typical ""Hollywood happy ending"" -- although none of the couple's problems seemed to be resolved. The parts of the storyline involving the daughter just seemed like filler; the reader gets no real sense of how Zoe is actually coping. Elizabeth Berg used to be a wonderful author, but this book is more like a sappy Harlequin romance than a moving novel that makes you feel truly caught up in the characters' lives -- if you want to read THAT kind of book, try ""Range of Motion""."
3,"Parts of this can be trite, but overall it's a good read","I've been a fan of Elizabeth Berg's since I was in high school. I enjoyed reading Say When. At times it can be trite, but at its best it's the touching story of a man whose wife says she has a lover and is leaving him. They have a daughter together, whom the man struggles to care for in the midst of his shattered world. Some parts of the novel seem very true to life while others seem a bit far-fetched. I don't want to include any spoilers but at times you get frustrated with the main character and wish he'd grow a backbone. Still, you see that his love is the glue that holds the fractured family together. Parts of the book read rather melodramatic, like you can see them in a movie or something. But still it's an interesting and fast read -- a good beach read!For more book reviews and posts of interest to readers and writers, please visit my Blogspot blog, Voracia: Goddess of Words."
3,It was okay,"I agree with the previous reviewer in saying that one of the reasons for divorce is immaturity. People are so quick to give up because of things that can definitely be worked out. I guess that comes from no patience with I definitely do not have.I can say that the daugther is this book, named Zoe did not help at all because she was so fresh to her parents and very rude, but you can't blame her that is the lack of discipline.Later...."
3,Good but not Berg's best,"I've read all of Elizabeth's Berg's novels, and while this one is good, I know she can do better! I was riveted to the story, but put off by all the descriptions of the characters' clothing. Isn't that the first thing you learn in writing classes? Skip the eye color and find something more insightful that what color shirt the character is wearing! Otherwise, it was an enjoyable read, although not as ""meaty"" as her other work. I found the man's point-of-view refreshing, and I enjoyed learning what Santas think behind the beard. The daughter's character was very annoying. She acted like a 3-year-old in some scenes, then like a pre-teen in others. Still, I love Berg's writing and would recommend this book to anyone who feels the same."
2,TOO EMPHATIC!!,"Elizabeth Berg's new novel ""Say When"" is a huge disappointment. Unless they are awarding prized for having the most ITALICS in current fiction; there are ITALICS on EVERY SINGLE page. Too TOO many ITALICIZED words! It's like having a TEN year old read it to you! I think she was TRYING to paint and ARNEST picture of a TROUBLED marriage from the viewpoint of the MAN for a change. But it just doesn't WORK."
4,Say When,"A fast paced sorrowful tale with a predictable ending. Characters were engaging and brave, sticking to their goals and objectives . Recommended by a book club."
3,Good read,"I am a big fan of Elizabeth Berg and have read quite a few of her novels. This is not my favorite. It is a satisfying, well written novel and involves you emotionally and fleshes out the dynamics of a marriage not working. In previous Berg's novels I've enjoyed like Open House and Pull of the Moon, I found a unique insight into the inner working of womens concerns and emotions. This book told from the husbands perspective did not deliver with the Ellen. She seemed selfish and unbalanced and hence Griffin seemed to me somewhat the same in wanting her."
2,It was... okay.,"This is my first Elizabeth Berg novel, and I have to say that though it had some interesting quirks, I didn't find it moving at all. The husband is erratic and spiteful and the wife is selfish and emotionally immature. Humor could very easily be derived from these personality flaws, but the narration style is so flat and removed that I didn't chuckle much. The daughter is a nicely drawn character, as are the restaurant owner and the waitress, but when the main characters are as unconvincing as these, I don't get drawn in. It's not a bad book, but it isn't a good book, either."
4,Another Fine Book from Elizabeth Berg,"I think Berg got this one right. Having been through a similar experience myself, I recognized Griffin's pain and actions. It doesn't matter whether you are male or female, this hurts and it hurts both genders equally. There is nothing more demoralizing than finding out that your partner has fallen in love with someone else while at the same time you have been oblivious. Hits you right in the gut, actually.This is a very realistic portrayal of the pain of separation and it's affect on all those involved. I remember well the sleepless nights and constant questioning and ""what ifs."" It is hard to believe that someone you have devoted years to could abandon your love.I disagree with those who felt that Berg's male point of view is weak. I think she did a fine job with this book and I certainly look forward to more of the same. I think a sequel to this one might be in order."
3,Where's the Beef?,"I am a Berg fan from way back, Pull of the Moon, What We Keep and Talk Before Sleep being my favorites. Say When didn't do it for me. There just wasn't a whole lot there, folks. Immature woman has midlife crisis, hubby reacts in saint like fashion, while spoiled daughter gets pulled back and forth. Had Berg not mentioned the daughter's age, I would be left guessing, as her behavior ranged from that of a 4 year old to what one might expect of a 16 year old. Didn't quite understand how wifey came to resolve her crisis either....it just sort of ended. And, what's with L.D. making another appearance? Are we that short on characters? Say When worked as a decent beach read, not a book you have to think about....not a book that will stay with me."
3,"A nice read, but could have been better","I bought this book with high hopes of loving it but it was hit and miss, the first half. I almost stopped reading it, bored with the script of Ellen leaving, Ellen's feelings, Ellen's selfishness, Ellen's everything. I couldn't connect with her like I have done with other characters Ms. Berg has written about. She seemed not to have the depth and empathy. Griffin's character got better as the book went on and seeing how he developed in his feelings about himself and his marriage and role as a parent.I'm glad I stuck with it, but have enjoyed other books of hers much more. The ending was expected but not too perfect as some novels are, with everything wrapped up with a bow."
2,"A long, meandering journey to nowhere","When couples separate, there is a reason. And one would think that a spouse, left suddenly when his wife announces she has a lover, would use this occasion to learn something about himself, about the wife, about their relationship. Yet in this book, Say When, it doesn't seem as if the husand, Griffin, ever learns. When his wife announces she is having an affair and wants out of the marriage, he is stunned, though the clues have been in the air for some time. Rather than trying to address what went wrong with their marriage, all Griffin can seem to do is alternately get angry then beg her to come back.Ultimately I didn't feel any of the characters changed in this story. Personally, I found the ending unsatisfying, and I saw it coming from a mile away. Griffin seemed smug to the end, never admitting his culpability in the marriage's undoing. In general, not a very satisfying read."
2,A man...written like a woman?,"In some ways I suppose this was a fine book, but I had trouble with the voice from the beginning. I just had a hard time believing that narrator's voice was male. Meaning -- it felt like a woman trying to write a man. Since I happen to be female, I surely don't understand how/why men think, but to me, Griffin's thought processes and memories seemed very womanlike. In addition, the ending was predictable and kind of cheesy.I've always thought that Berg is at her best while writing from the POV of a 12 or 13 year old girl. That's just my opinion, of course, but for some reason I think she tells a more powerful story when she uses that voice, instead of the quiet domestic dramas she creates when writing an adult."
5,My Perfect Mascara,I have used L'Oreal mascara for many years and have tried others but I always come back to my favorite.
3,"Entertaining, yet underdeveloped.","The script was witty and well executed by Pillippe and Gellar. I loved watching these two banter back and fourth about their conquests teasing eachother as they conversed, but I didn't find the love between Phillippe and Witherspoon's characters believable. It seemed to spring out of no where. They had a few heated arguments, one laugh and boom! They are in love! Is this like being on the play ground where the little boy hits the girl because he likes her? So Phillippe and Witherspoon fight a few times and we're supposed to believe tht Mr. Womanizer People User is in fact in love with this chaste flower and not meerly lusting after her? I don't think so."
4,yummy melodramatic adolescent goodness,"I was 14 years old when Cruel Intentions came out, and to my middle-school sensibilities it was absolutely the sexiest, most dramatic, decadent movie I could imagine. Of course now, I can see it for what it is, but I don't really enjoy it any less. Cruel Intentions updates the story of Dangerous Liaisons into a modern Manhattan prep school, and the story translates remarkably well. The youthful cast acquit themselves remarkably well, hitting just the right notes of entitlement and self-doubt. The story is melodramatic, but sharply written, not too long and with just enough mocking self-awareness to keep from being to ridiculousely serious. Cruel Intentions is a teen movie that teeters on the edge of eroticism (i.e. a remarkably chaste lesbian kiss), allowing its target audience to emulate the characters in the way that matters most; by allowing them to play at being grown-ups, while never losing sight of their true immaturity and inexperience."
4,"Frivolous reinterpretation of Les Liaisons Dangereuse, done very well.","For a movie on a really tight budget, using (at the time) B list talent, this one's done well. Les Liaisons Dangereuse is the precursor text, and updating it to late 20th century Manhattan does not damage the story at all -- the societies (pre-Revolutionary France and modern urban-extravagant culture) are eerily similar.The production values are high, the talent is well cast and works well within their roles, and the script is pretty solid. For a teen targeted puff piece of film, this one turned out to attract the attention of others."
2,Cruel Intentions,"A horrible movie, with bad acting (let me say that i despise Sarah Michelle Whats-it) but a heart-felt ending. Definitely not worth paying 8.00 or 3.75 for."
4,Steamy unpredictable fare,"I hadn't wanted to see ""Cruel Intentions"" because I thought it would be the typical teen fare. I was completely surprised by how good it was. Sarah Michelle Gellar and Ryan Phillipe are really good as step-siblings who are rich, bored, and scheming. Reese Witherspoon strikes all the right notes in her portrayal of an innocent sweet girl. The film will keep you guessing, and is entertaining throughout. A good film in the style of ""Dangerous Liasons""."
3,Watch it for SMG!,"watch this movie for sarah michelle gellar, if you're not a sarah michelle gellar fan. Don't watch this movie! Sarah Michelle Gellar doesn't get naked, but she has a lesbian scene and shows great cleavage! I admit, I was a little disapointed that SMG didn't get naked.There's this girl that has been a virgin and she had a boyfriend for years. Then there's this guy who likes to take girls' virginity away. In the movie, the girl was going out with the guy who had waited for her, and she just gave herself to the guy who liked to take the girl's virginity away, leaving the guy who waited, wasted years of his life and got nothing. A similar plot to this movie would be, Embrace of the Vampire. These 2 movies prove that if you have a girlfriend, you better make sure she's not gonna play you like a fool. That's what Cruel Intentions is about. The creator of this movie made this movie to point that out. :That don't wait for someone: because it could just be a waste of your time!"
1,The absolute WORST movie ever!,"How in the world anyone could like this movie at all is beyond belief! I love dramas and I was soooo disappointed in this ""thing"" that I could hardly stand it. It was almost laughable. It looked like a bunch of kids trying to pull of adult parts. This movie is nothing more than an attempt to profit off young fans of these young stars. I am not that ""old""...in my early thirties, and I found nothing entertaining about this movie. It was almost a comedy to see them try to act like adults in adult situations and try to make us think it is ""serious"" stuff. This movie, with it's lame plot and unnatural characters would have hardly went over with older actors playing these roles... much less with these actors... this was one big joke."
2,A Copy,This is a copy and I am not happy about it. Great Film. Gossip girl predecessor with better actors.
1,"Garbage, pure garbage...","This movie is poorly acted and even more poorly written. What on earth motivates these evil cretins? Fact is, we never find out. Awful, awful, awful. I actually walked out on this when it was in the theaters and later rented it, wondering if I had made a mistake the first time. I hadn't. Absolutely rotten movie, no redeeming qualities about it."
4,Beauty & Charisma,"Beautiful actors, amazing clothing and a perfect setting. New York City, is the location of this film. The whole time this film gives you drama, comedy, romance and action (well some action).Sara, Ryan, joshua and selma make a divine cast. My complements to the makers."
4,Well Done,This film is beautifly put together. Sarah Michelle Gellar plays a great role as the ever so perfect Kathryn who's brother Sebastion is a sly ladies man. Reese Witherspoon acts wonderfully also. Sorry if I didnt go to deep into the movie in this certain review.
5,"Cruel, very cruel","This movie was great! Ryan Phillipe acted well, Sarah Michelle Gellar looked beautiful as always, Selma Blair was hysterical, Joshua Jackson, well let's not talk about his character, and Reese Witherspoon was typical superb. Watch it!"
2,The title says it all,"This movie has to be one of the best good vs. evil movies that I have ever seen, and the most unpleasant and disturbing one. I watched it, and I thought it was an okay film about how evil people can be towards one another. I would not reccommend this to everyone...The plot is so trashy. But if your looking for a movie where the good guys win, go ahead, but be forewarned. There is plenty of graphic sex talk, and some of the scenes are really graphic too."
1,Dumb!,"This movie was just... not very good! The plot was okay, but the ending, and the acting were terrible. I would not recommend this movie, I think you'll be disappointed. But hey, that's just my opinion!"
1,lamest movie i've ever seen... well it's up there....,"lamest movie i've ever seen... well it's up there.... as the worst ""teen movies"".. what a waste of great talented actors..."
3,Put on the shields,"This is not a movie for children who think that the characters in this movie are ""cool"". This is for those people who wish to see just why our western culture is coming apart at the seems. There are so many metaphors in the dialogue connectiong something decent and what was once considered incorruptible with a horrid act that the character makes. Do not buy this movie thinking that it would be good for junior high students. This is for those who are sophisticated enough to realize the behavior is not to be copied."
5,BEST MOVIE EVER MADE!!!!,"Over the numerous movies Ive seen in my life, I must say this is by far the absolute best. Based on a controversial novel, Cruel Intentions has brought the word 'seduction' to a whole new level. Prepare to engross yourself into the world of the upper east side, where the only form of amusement for Sebastian and Katherine is to screw with other people's lives and see how many people they can bed. Both provocative and endearing this movie is far different then any you have seen. These people are brutal and refuse to sensor themselves to please others, which I find most attractive about this movie. Above all else Ryan Phillipe and Sarah Michelle Gellar make a phenomenal pair and truly engross themselves in their roles. This movie is a must have for all movie collections."
4,Mesmorizing,This movie is so addictive once you watch it once it is never boring to watch again. Just go rent or buy this movie it is so interesting
2,geller is stellar!,"I didn't think this movie was as good as it's predecessor Dangerous Liasons, the acting was much better in Dangerous too. With the exception of Gellar. She is really a good actress, but from what i have seen her in for movies, she doesn't pick them very well. unless they are picking her. She is wasting her talents in this movie. Reese witherspoon is the only other actor in the entire film besides that i feel has any true acting ability. the rest of the cast is wooden, and ryan phillipe maybe cute but he couldn't act his way out of a paperbag. i gave this movie two stars..one for sarah and one for reese."
4,like it lots,"I really like this movie, I know alot of people think it is cheesy, not I, it is over the top and I like it."
5,THIS WAS A GREAT MOVIE! A MUST SEE!,"I thought this movie was great! I mean the plot and story lines was excellent! The scenerio was so up to date and the lines in some scenes just put you in stitches! To top it off, the people cast in each role were absokutly PERFECT! I mean don't get me wrong. I'm not a buffy lover or anything else. I just think this movie was so fresh and up beat. I mean I have never seen a movie like this. I would definatly recommend it to anyone. Hope you like it too! -lotsa love- :o)"
5,the movie was fantastic,"with great acting and a superb storyline you cant go wrong with this film about a devious brother and sister who set out to destroy the reputation of the new head-master's daughter. i highly reccomend this film to anyone who wants to laugh, cry, and have a good time."
3,one of my favorite teen films before 2000,"this movie was short and sweet mixed with solid drama, a little comedy, and action at the end of the movie i watch this movie last year and thought it wouldn't be much but after the 15 mins mark it get very interesting how the teen relatives who i think were brother and sister were playing pratical jokes a everyone in their high school that seriously affected their lives the ending was sad but the peaceful song made up for it and including the girl who ruined everyone's lives she got what she deserved by being expelled from school"
4,all messed up,"This movie is definitly crazy not to mention completly random.I was shocked the first time i watched this movie.The bluntness and everything was hysterical,thats what i love most about the movie.All the characters are funny and unique and you will be either loving them or hating them by the end.Definitly a good watch for the younger population and those who are not easily offended.:)"
1,The Movie Stinks!!,I agree with Viewer from somewhere on earth that this is one BAD movie! BAD kids or really sick people will enjoy this movie - people like the Viewer from San Francisco (see review below) who's definetely bound for hell for her/his bad language and bad taste in films. Do yourself a favour and give this movie a miss.
1,Liked the happy ending,"Frankly, the plot of this film sucks various portions of the anatomy. However, as I watched, I developed a deep seeded hatred for the two main characters. That's why I like the ending. It's always refreshing to see two evil pr***s truly get what's coming to them. I felt almost a sense of satisfaction when Sebastian got bounced off the car. And I had to chuckle with delight when I saw Katherines face at the end. The ending was worth the two hours of monotony."
1,NO STARS.,"This movie was so bad, I wish I could have given it no stars. The acting was horrible and the plot was dull and predictalbe. I knew he was gonna get hit by that car, and I was glad. That whole sex scene between whats-her-face, and whose-that-guy was stupid. She's a virgin and it just felt that good? Gimme a friggin' break. And whats the big deal about the kiss between Selma Blair and that one chick who isn't that hot and has no talent? It didn't turn me on one bit. This is one of the worst movies I have ever had the misfortune of sitting through in my life. People who like this kind of movie deserve exactly what they get: CRAP!"
3,"A creative,unusally remake","Cruel Intensions is a remake from Dangerous Lisions. This movie was a unusal but funny,dramtized movie. There was some bad acting that I won't mention, but the movie was a pretty good remake. So all in all it's worth the trip."
3,it was good,"this movie was`nt nearly as bad as most people said but i was a bit disappointed in it ,even so it was a good movie the charecters got what they diserved but i did`nt like what they did with sebastien at the end"
3,Boz's Review of Cruel Intentions,"Cruel Intentions is a good film contrary to popular belief. It is not a great film but better than some of the films in the same genre that came out at that time such as: The In Crowd and Notting Hill. The film looks at the shallowness of the rich and others that is prevalant in our bars, dance clubs and in the mass culture in general. If you do not like Gellar, Phillipe, or Witherspoon do not even waste your time with this film. It is primarily a character study of Ryan Phillipe's character Sebastian. The plot is not spectacular but better than the In Crowd (2000). I am looking forward to seeing the sequels."
5,this rocks,i loved this movie and it's second best out of the trilogy.3 uis the best though no contest.
5,Cruel Intenions,"This remake is very good. Gellar, Phillippe and Witherspoon are great actors and the ending is sad. Very enjoyable movie."
3,I like the movie..but bad acting,"Bad acting plagued this movie...Ryan Phillipe and Sarah Michelle Gellar are lousy and rather unbelievable in their roles. Reese Witherspoon and Selma Blair turn out excellent performances that (thankfully) detract from the terrible performance of the show's ""stars""."
2,I was disapointed by this film.,"I was very eager to see the movie Cruel Intentions because it had a lot of my favorite ppl in it. However, it wasn't as great as it was made out to be. It was an unrealistic plot, which was all about sex, and they way you can turn yourself into this monster, this sex crazed monster. I would not recommend this movie for anyone under 18.....it is jus too much."
2,Disappointing.............,"This could have been so much better if they had cast the right actress to play the part of Kathryn. Sarah Michelle Gellar (""cool"" as she may be), certainly was not able to pull off this part. She came across as a 12 year old stealing a sip of champagne from 'mommy's glass'. Ryan's character came alive during the scenes between him and the ever brilliant Reese Witherspoon (who I might add, was the only actress and character worth caring about). Selma Blair just irritated as the 'naive' and downright pathetic Cecile. The 'kiss' between her and Ms. Gellar was completely pointless and had zero relevance to the actual plot (guess the far superior 'Wild Things' was the inspiration - huh?) Sarah may 'kick' as Buffy, but as Kathryn she limps. I've seen better."
3,Parental lock not compatible with some players,"Excellent movie, but the ""Parental Lock"" feature was not compatible with my JVC player. The ""Parental Lock"" feature allows the movie to be rated by the player. I.E. this movie has a PG version as well with the right settings on your machine.On my machine, I was able to view the full R rating, but the additional features were locked out."
5,One of the best movies on the earth!!!,"I would just like to say that this is one of my favorite movies of all time!!! Ryan Phillpe is so sexy, and Sarah Michelle Geller is great as Kathryn, who's a life-ruining b*tch. Reese Witherspoon, who is a really good actress, plays Annette, the good girl, and she does a GREAT job at it. My friends and I all love this movie and watch it a lot. Of course, my sister had to bring it to school last year and she lost it, so I'm asking for a new one for Christmas. Anyway, it's an awesome movie. Please please PLEASE buy it or at least rent it."
4,Cruel Intentions,"Well, I liked the movie a lot, it was...interesting. Its about two young and beautiful people who play with other people's hearts, and about a young lady named Kathryn, who destroys anyone who gets in her way. sahra, Ryan, Selma, and Reese give a wonderful preformance on screen and it is amazing! You'll also be pleased by the high quality in this DVD."
2,Oh. My. Goodness.,"I'll start off by saying that this movie had a lot of promise in the beginning. The dialogue (especially a lot of Sebastion's lines) was really witty and smart.But somewhere near the climax, the movie turned into another sappy teen romance movie. That really disappointed me. I was hoping for something a little more than that. And (SPOILER) what also really disappointed me about this movie was when Annette lost her virginity. Her character changed so fast that it was unbelievable! It would have been more interesting if she had stayed a virgin."
4,"Excellent Movie, But a Bit Disappointing","This movie was one of the best movies I have seen in awhile. It left me in shock and able to think about nothing else for three days. The stars shine, but are a bit tarnished. Gellar is at her sexy best, Phillipe is kind of believable as the womanizer, and Witherspoon is pretty good. The dialogue is wonderful, with the banter between Gellar and Phillipe very funny. The movie has gotten bad reviews, but I thought it was wonderful."
5,"truly a ""Bittersweet Symphony""","The movie was, to say the least, completely awesome. As an actor, I was simply awestruck by the work of the actors. The story was well written with severy creative plot twists. I loved the ending, and I wish more playwrites could captivate the creativity presented in this movie. I especially loved the way they played ""Bittersweet Symphony"" at the end. I highly recommend it."
1,Don't waste your time...,"Heres the whole flick in 10 words: Several rich snotty highschool brats being mean to each other. Some idiot at my group rental summer house rented this pile of feces, and insisted that about a dozen of us sit and watch it. After the first half hour I made the conscious decision to get absolutely heinously drunk, because I had to do something to take my mind off of how badly I wanted to plant my foot up the rear end of the idiot who rented this flick. I actually wasted over 2 hours of my LIFE on this video, and I urge others not to do the same."
1,Horrible acting other than Geller,"This movie is pathetic, if you want to see it done well, try Dangerous Liasons. That one won Oscar's and had an incredible cast. J.Malkovitch, K.Reeves, M.Pfeiffer, G.Close , and U.Thurman. This one just stinks."
4,Cruel Intentions,"I loved this movie in High School and I still love it today. On Blu-ray absolutely everything looks great. And of course it is always fun to see Sarah Michelle Gellar and Joshua Jackson (that's right, he is in this!) out of their usual roles. Love it!"
3,An Un-Cruel Review,"Cruel Intentions, a movie about sex, lies, and truth, delivers a pretty good on/off screen chemistry between Philippe & Witherspoon. (It has to be good, right? They ARE married!) Selma Blair plays a good ditsy-minded girl, who plays a new sexually active woman in the movie. Sarah Michelle Gellar played a great [actress] in the movie, which you'll find very amusing. It's also kinda funny how she wants to hook up with her cousin, (Philippe) and totally mis-lead his girl (Witherspoon)The end has a cool climax where Witherspoon rats SMG out about everything she's done. You'll like it, on way or another."
4,Great Movie!,"I loved this movie. I don't own a dvd player, don't think I will anytime soon, but when I saw this movie in the theatre, I loved it. Everyone was both funny and sexy / charasmatic. This movie was the bomb, and when it comes out on video (hopefully in widescreen), I hope to get it before everyone else does in my neighborhood!"
5,"Great Acting,","When I 1st saw this movie I realized it had no genre it was a whole mix of things. This is really good - since I'm the very first person to review I can tell people that this is my second fave movie of all time. Sarah Michelle Gellar plays Kathryn na dits possibly the best shes done! I can recommend this flick to anyone dirty, naughty, funny or people with class."
5,"It was an awesome movie, Ryan Phillippe is incredible!",I saw the movie in the theater and can't wait until it's available to buy. Ryan Phillippe is my favourite actor and played the part of a seducing sex maniac very well. The chemistry between Ryan and Reese Witherspoon was remarkable and I only hope that they star in more films together. My favourite part was when Katherin(Sarah Michelle Gellar) gets hers in the end. The ending was perfect even thought I wish that Sebastian survived so that he and Annette could be together. It is definitely my favourite movie at the moment.
3,A Watered Down Version of a Great Film,"By the time I saw this movie, I had already seen ""Dangerous Liaisons"" superbly acted by Glenn Close, Michelle Pfifer and John Malkovich (omission of Keanu is intentional). In a nutshell, it just does not compare. Even though the story is the same, Dangerous Liaisons is wittier, better acted and does not rely on pseudo-porn to keep you watching. The three star rating goes to the story, which is great. However, if you want the real experience, go for the original, Dangerous Liaisons, which doesn't alter the ending and is also available on DVD (probably cheaper too)."
2,A Movie on Corrupted Teenagers,"A teenage flick banking on popularity of the currently hot stars (Gellar, Phillipe, Witherspoon). The movie is full of bad morals and bad role models. Most of the movie only focused on sex, deception, obsession and rich kids who are lazy, show-offs, rude and oh, just morally corrupt. ""Dangerous Liaison"" was at least tolerable because its characters are adults playing deadly games and the costumes were gorgeous. ""Cruel Intentions"" is just not a good movie to recommend. The 2 stara are for the fine acting by Witherspoon."
5,Seduction at it's Finest,"This movie was so amazing and I was extremely attracted to the theme. The story involves alot of seduction and betrayal. I call that the perfect mix for a teen movie. I am a teenager myself, and I found it to be quite interesting. The cast was great, and I think that made the movie even better. It was a movie involvong every type of character, the good girl, the evil whore, and to top it off, one guy for both girls. I would reccomend seeing it, but watch out because the content is a little intense sometimes. I hope you see it and enjoy!"
3,Quality of AV is there. Story is only ok.,This movie was ok and the blue ray was good but I don't think I would recommend you buy it. You may want to see it but I would not go to the expense of buying a movie that I think I will only want to watch the one time.
1,P0rn for the un-resourceful,"Are you too dumb to hide your own p0rn? Well, by golly, here is a film for you. ""Look ma, its based on a french movie!"" Well, hot dang, that means culture! Culture! Culture Culture! Do you know what that means, you heathen barbarians? Back, back! Instead of watching insipid MTV remixes that take actual peices of art like Dangerous Liasions and distill them into approximatetly 8 minutes worth of vaugely arousing footage, why don't you go into the yard and flagellate yourselves? Then those of us who are superior intellectually can easily avoid wasting our valuable time with snot brained rat rectums like yourselves by simply avoiding anyone with blood pouring down their backs! Go watch some real cinema, like A Pure Formality or Long Day's Journey into Night. Or at least watch Night of the Hunter, and learn something valuable, like how to beat a fish to death with an ore."
1,Brings bad to a new low,"Soap opera for 6th graders, to call this movie bad would be an insult to bad movies. This is clearly made for teens who really, really, really, wish they were cool. Here's a hint: if you are watching [stuff] like this you are not cool. The cool people are out doing stuff while you sit in front of your TV watching Dawson's Creek and wondering why you are getting heavier."
3,bad influence on kids,"Sarah Michelle Gellar was gorgeous in her brunetteness. I didn't like the other actors in this movie and I didn't like this movie. It's a glossy movie that glamourizes meanness and Sarah Michelle Gellar's downfall in the end is so unlikely that I betcha some untalented and unlovable rich girls are out there right now sleeping around, taking drugs and sabotaging working girls like Tara Reid, Mischa Barton and Lindsey Lohan with initial false friendship. Sometimes we watch things we know ahead of time that we won't like because it's popular (e.g. Devil's Advocate) because we know it is going to have a social influence. Only by being exposed to the information, will the subsequent patterns of behavior be recognized."
1,uck!,"I found this movie to be very slow moving. The acting was far from par. At times I just could not wait until the end so it would be over, and when it finally got there, I thought that the ending was DUMB. I was also appalled at the amount of evilness."
1,Only for Sarah,She's the only one who cares in this picture. I did not like the movie. Except fot her (Sarah Michelle Gellar) the movie is really bad. But I loved to see Sarah in a different role. Bye
1,Still shocked,It is one of the most weird and saddest movies I've ever seen. I cannot forgive those who made it that they did not state clearly who is evil and who innocent among characters. It can easily serve as model for empty headed youngsters how to become mooks and (...)be proud of it at the same time. I must praise Reese Witherspoon for genuine acting but I still shudder with the very thought of it. Hope I won't know anybody like them.
4,A cool twist on Dangerous Liasons,"I thought the movie was great! If a movie can get teenagers interested in classic literature, it's great. I thought it stayed true to Dangerous Liasons, it just modernized it. In a word- fun!"
4,Enjoyable trash,"I liked the movie very much and if you do not take it seriously, you will enjoy it very much. Phillipe and Gellar are great as competing rich kids."
5,"Fantastic, a MUST buy!","You must buy this film. It has one of the best DvD featuresaround and that's not even to do with the film (there's loads todo). If you don't buy it in DVD then buy or even rent the movie. The acting is superb and the plot is constantly changing at every turn. The characters and their emotions are constanly changing, the acting is brill. This film has comedy and drama, Cecile is the most hilarous character ever and I loved to hate both Kathryn and Sebastin (RP is so cute! ) but I didn't like Annette. The soundtrack is fantastic even without the movie. The ending I believed should have been different but even though. Dialogue is great and funny. There is more than just sex in it (which parents don't seem to understand! ) (infact there's hardly any nudity and the thing is that there is suggestiveness of sexual stuff) Don't miss this once in a lifetime outstanding film, which provides a modern translation of the ideas of Dangerous Liasions for modern day teens."
1,Bad software on this DVD will harm some DVD players,"Just diagnosed by engineers at JVC repair centers, this DVD can cause certain makes of DVD players (like my JVC) to freeze and be unable to read or play ANY DVD. Beware. This is (in my opinion) the equivilant of a VIRUS! Some Toshiba and Sony DVD players are also susceptible."
1,Cruel movie,"I don't care at all about the infamous lesbian kiss in this picture. This is a only a detail ina horrible movie that is horrible because the screenplay is horrible. Philips is at his worst as an actor, Whiterspoon is ridiculous. THis is so bad as ""CLUELESS"". Skip it, it's a typical modern garbage."
1,Horrible Acting,"This movie was pretty horrible. The plot wasn't all together terrible, but the acting was just awful, and it ruined what could have been a pretty good movie. Personally, I don't think it is worth wasting your time on to watch."
1,CRUEL INTENTIONS INDEED !,"The producers of this movie really had crel intentions when shooting this lousy picture. The acting is horrible, the actor are irritating (mainly Ryan Philippe), there is not one convincing scene in all the picture. Only two times in my life I walked away from a theater in the middle of a movie, and one of these times was in the middle of this parody of a film. No, I'm not a little bit ""shocked"" by supposed sex scenes (I watch porn movies! ), but simple shocked by one of the worst scripts I've ever seen."
5,SOOOOOOOOOO Sad,"My favorite part of the movie is Reese Witherspoon. She is my favorite actress, and was great in this movie. Ryan Phillippe is not only really cute, but a great actor. The entire movie is really entertaining, but I must admit I would change the ending."
3,"Entertaining, but juvenile","Cruel Intentions takes an intriguing plot and makes it ridiculous by putting it in a highschool setting. It is something of a mid-teen fantasy movie: it makes your average highschooler feel very adult when faced with ""peers"" Kathryn (Gellar) and Sebastian (Phillippe) playing the games of lust, deceit, and sexual ruination as if they really had any idea at 18 about real life. Phillippe manages to pull off his character, but Gellar is completely unsuited for the role of the psuedo-enlightened highschool student. The plot is much more suited to the setting of Dangerous Liasons, on which this movie was based.Having said all of that, if you can get past the juvenile nature of it and watch the movie for what it is, it is still reasonably entertaining, and will still serve to occupy you for it's 97 minute runtime."
2,Not the best...,"A viewer from Maryland below wrote ""Why are thirty year olds watching this movie and then putting it down?"" Do thirty year olds not have the right to review a so called ""teen flick"", which by the way I don't consider this movie to be. I didn't like this movie myself simply because I feel that it was a bit silly. I was in the mood for a drama and the case didn't tell me that I should look elsewhere if that was wanted I wanted. It promoted itself as an interesting drama...for all ages."
4,people should see it for what it really is...,"""Cruel Intentions"" isn't the best movie out there but I find it strange that so many people hate it so much. As I see it, it was without a doubt meant to be a teen movie, so it shouldn't be judged by great theatrical standards. It was a good teen flick. Why are thirty year olds watching it, then putting it down anyway? They should have known it wasn't meant to be a great drama."
3,A SATISFYING REMAKE,"A modern version of ""Dangerous Liaisons."" Convincingly told, suitably suspenseful, and they cleverly play out all major events in a late 20th century fashion. (Note: I never read the book; I'm just going by the John Malkovich movie in the 80s.)Sarah Michelle Gellar and Ryan Phillippe play step-brother and -sister, pampered, awash in luxuries, indescribably vain, and obsessed with their own prominence in their social world. They see themselves as modern Roman emperors presiding over the Coliseum of New York's upper crust. They are intelligent, perceptive, imaginative, and rabid.The movie spins out a nicely complicated web of relationships, the classic cross and double-cross, and it becomes downright harrowing to see these beautiful young people doing each other in like wolves crazed by famine.Lastly, the scenery is quite satisfying. The architecture and furnishings of their home, Phillippe's car, and indisputably Gellar's wardrobe."
3,Cruel Intentions,"I love teen movies, like Can't Hardly Wait & Wild Things (which really isn't a teen movie but oh well), so I decided to watch Cruel Intentions, it had a good cast so that excited me. So, I'm watching it and it's not really that good. I was kind of bored, I thought it could of been so much better but I had expectations up too high. I think Wild Things is much better and enjoyable than this one. And the ""lesbian"" kissing scene in this one, is not very tasteful at all, it has bubbles of saliva, and it was kind of gross watching because their spit and stuff. But yeah, the movie isn't great. The idea was okay. If you have to see it, I say RENT IT."
3,"First is good, second is eh...","The first Cruel Intentions was such a good movie, Actors you actually hear of, & can relate to(kinda), Sarah M. Gellar, Ryan Phillipe, and Reese Witherspoon were good charactars... The second one is not all that great, for some reason the story seems to be identical to the first, As much as I like the first, I wanted something different for the second, The charactars also had the exact same names, but they are clearly different people, They should have gotten the same actors if they wanted that!!!!!!!! No wonder it was a straight to video release, no one wants to pay to see the same film twice, stick with the first one, and I just got the 3rd(hopefully its a DIFFERENT story), but if I hadnt seen the first, I might have liked the second, but the reason I didnt is because it was the same story with inferior actors/actresses playing the roles, so 4 1/2 stars for the first, 2 1/2 for the second, It averages out to 3 1/2 stars."
5,I was really curious about what was in that ... diary...,"i just saw this movie and it was awesome!!! the wait was definetely worth it. some people might consider this movie offensive but to me it was anything but that. it's very blunt which is one of the reasons i love it. Ryan (my favorite character), Sarah Michelle, and Reese did a GREAT job acting their roles out. personally my favorite part of the movie was the end cause of that song bittersweet symphony and it totally took me by surprise. this movie is definetely one of my faves now!"
3,Carmen - 'Fandangos In Space/Dancing On Cold Wind' (Angel Air),"A nicely assembled reissue of Carmen's two critically aclaimed lp's on two discs. 'Fandangos In Space' ('73) and 'Dancing On Cold Wind' ('75). Carmen was a short-lived ensemble that apparently fused progressive rock with flamenco music, not something that many bands have tried, let alone succeed. Not your typical Angel Air release, but if you enjoy good Spanish dance music, you should get something out of this 2-CD title. Line-up: Robert Amaral - castanets & vocals, David Allen - guitar / his sister Angela Allen - keyboards, John Glascock (Jethro Tull) - bass and Paul Fenton - drums. Might appeal to fans of Triana, Fold Zandura and Cetu Javu."
2,The Art of Russian Massage,"I was born and grew up in Russia, and I had some training in Russian massage. I am also a certified massage practitioner here in the US, so I purchased the video with the purpose of reviewing of what I learned in Russia. I found the video not entirely useless, but only somewhat helpful. I wish instead of demonstrating cupping and honey massage Olena would focus more on the Russian massage techniques and demonstrated the application on the full body, not just the back."
5,It can't get any better...,"Okay... token cliche comparisons... Radiohead and Coldplay meet the gentler, more emotional side of Massive Attack with a splash of The Verve. I haven't bought an album that has touched me this deeply since OK Computer. Buy it, put it on at a good volume on your favourite stereo with the speakers a good distance apart, lay down on the couch and forget about the world for the next 50mins or so as you lose yourself in swirling, emotion-saturated melodies that remind you how beautiful music can be."
4,give it a few listens,itll take a few careful listnes to appreciate whats going on in these songs. theres a subtle brilliance to it that many people overlook.
5,Fantastic Debut!!,"I keep hearing Elbow lumped in with Coldplay, Travis, Radiohead and I don't understand why. Elbow sound absolutely nothing like Travis and have little to do with Radiohead. I loved Coldplay's ""Parachutes"", but I think ""Asleep"" is even better. ""Any Day Now"" is a phenomenal opening track. Other favs are ""Powder Blue"" and the beautiful, ""Newborn"". Nicest love song I've heard in a while. Definitely more than a touch of Peter Gabriel in that voice."
5,Really really good.,"Much better than Coldplay, and better than Doves. Most of these songs have the enormous bass sound of a Massive Attack, which sound just incredible on headphones (or I'm sure on a club system). And the singing is just wonderful. Big sweeping songs, that don't really sound like anybody else. While Thom and the boys twiddle their knobs Elbow has stepped in to make the first great cd of the millenium. It's released here now, it's cheap... do yourself a favor and pick this one up - it'll stay at the top of your pile for a long time. Stunning."
2,Not as good as his other books,"I love Gavin Edwards's other books. 'Scuse Me While I Kiss This Guy, When A Man Loves A Walnut, and Deck The Halls With Buddy Holly were hilarious and had great illustrations. However, I was really disappointed with this one. The ""misheard lyrics"" seem much more contrived (does anyone really hear ""my goat knows the bowling score"" instead of ""Michael, row the boat ashore?""), and the illustrations (which are the real meat and drink of these books) were not only unimaginative and badly done, but many were blatantly sexual, which I feel goes against the simple, childlike atmosphere the illustrations are supposed to create. There's nothing wrong with a blatantly sexual misheard lyric, but my problem is with the illustrations. I'd been looking for this book for a long time, so you can imagine how disappointed I was by it.If you're looking for a book on misheard lyrics, get his other books. They are hilarious, and I love the pictures in those."
5,Hilarious!,I have almost all of Edwards' books and I can read them over and over. To this day I still find humor in each entry. These books will always be an enjoyable read. Thank you Gavin Edwards!
1,worst use of paper ever,"After hearing only a few of the terrible excuses for a ""mondegreen"", which is the technical term given by the author to describe the misheard lyrics, all of which were blatantly made up by the author because of the terrible examples given, I was astounded that this book made it to print. One horrid example is from Bob Marley and the Wailers, ""Jammin'"", We're jammin'-I hope you like jammin' too. His example is as follows, ""Pajamas-I hope you like pajamas too"". I find it hard to swallow that anyone could possibly make such a grievous error. I can't find anything funny about something so obvoiusly aimed at folks who have never heard the actual song. I hope Edwards has not made too much money on this book, as it weakens my belief in the intelligence of our country. I will end my review by saying money spent on this book would be better invested in toilet paper. I can't believe trees died for the publication of this book."
1,This Book is Heinous,"This book, no offense to the author, must have been written for simple minded folk who have little interest in music or in intellectual reading material. ""He's Got the Whole World in his Pants"" is one example of the mindless lyrics Edwards obviously makes up himself, as no single person in the entire world would ever mistake the lyrics of that song for something different. What a waste of time. I mean, seriously, this book is supposed to be a collection of ""misheard lyrics"", but I think that Gavin is the only person who could ever possibly hear them the way he presents them. Let me give another heinous example of this guy's contrived lyrics: ""Michael, row the boat ashore"" has been cleverly replaced by ""My goat knows the bowling score."" Stop insulting my intelligence Mr. Edwards, this stuff is not amusing, it's downright horrendous."
3,Political not Military History,"A thorough review of the religious and geopolitical, but not militry, history of the Iran Iraq war. The author provides little critical analysis in what is an almost textbook like format. There is extensive coverage of the political issues and of the internal battles fought by both of the combatants, especially Iraq, to maintain internal public support. When one reads how well Hussien managed the internal political challenges of the Iran Iraq war, his survival of the Gulf War seems less of a surprise. The economic issues of waging the war, an issue often left out of military history, is well documented. There is good analysis of the involvement of the superpowers and the legal and illegal sale of arms to both sides. There is only very minimal coverage of military strategy, tactics, and weapons and only a cursory description of the campaigns."
3,Decent Shoe...,This is a decent shoe for those of you with a wide foot. It is a good deal for the price but it isn't the best shoe for cushioning. The foam in the sole is rather stiff and breaks down very quickly. If you can get it for $60 or less I would buy it (including shipping). It isn't worth more than $60. Good enough but not great.
4,"Although I'm not very big into make-up, I ...","Although I'm not very big into make-up, I found this liner very soft and subtle. The color stayed on all evening and didn't smudge. The pencil sharpened well and overall, I'd have to say this product was great and I'd definitely recommend it to family and friends."
4,I'm very impressed with this product. It has ...,I'm very impressed with this product. It has almost the same quality as the expensive stuff I got from the department store. I think I'll switch to Le Plum Prunelle after I'm done with my current one.
3,Much faster meters now available,"I bought this meter for a relative so that we could have a single source for our supplies. (I already have the same meter.) The results appear in about five seconds, which is sufficiently fast for our needs.I'm not so paiently waiting for a non-invasive meter. I understand that several are being developed and should be on the market in a year or so."
5,Carry this in my purse,"My mother have owned many health food stores she is a chinese Herbologist,Iridologist, and Colon Cleanser.When I was 4 years old I attempted to cut and orange by myself and Sliced down my left hand between the index finger and middle finger.My brother poured this onto my open wound on the way to the hospital and it helped stall my blood loss before the stitched my hand up."
4,healing powder,"I bought this to help my cat with an ear issue. It was not that easy to work with, somewhat messy. Once I learned the combination of powder to water it was easier to deal with. It did seen to work, though."
3,Yunnan Baiyao Powder,Wasn't real happy with the way it was suppose to work. Package was to small and the powder was hard to mix.
1,powder,the smallest bottle I have ever seen and NO it didn't stop nail from bleedingWould not puchase item again
4,Not every track is a hit but you can't go wrong with that voice,"Soulful, playful, and the kind of voice you don't hear anymore. I'm only in my early 40's and I didn't grow up listening to her but once I discovered her there was no going back."
5,A great album with a guest appearance by Carl Weathersby,An enjoyable album with the added bonus of Carl Weathersby fans getting to listen to his guest appearance on the recording. carlweathersby.org
5,Excellent tea!,"At first I was skeptical about buying tea online, but this online store was a good find. Darjeeling teas are difficult to find in stores, especially those that are not blends.We drink our tea without milk (though I like to sweeten mine with sugar). I am not a great connosieur of teas, but my husband loved it, and I liked it too.The company also sent us a sample of their nepalese tea, which was also surprisingly good.Definitely a quality tea."
2,Beware,"Beware. This recording is a reissue of Kubelik's 1959 recording with the Vienna Philharmonic, originally issued by Decca, clearly identified as such, and with identical timings. It is not as described in Mr. Gomes Pardo's review, which is either fantasy, or may possibly refer to a completely different recording, with the Czech Philharmonic, which was made in 1990. The two stars do not refer to the quality of the recording, which is good for its time, but to the misidentified provenance in Mr. Gomes Pardo's review."
1,Unedited Brain Dump,"I am sure the author is an excellent designer, but he has no business writing. His lecture-like tone reprimands us in the first section to think about our audience, something he forgot to do in his writing.I would have expected New Riders, the publishers, to have someone read this book who was actually trying to learn something from it. It can't be done. I am a reasonably computer literate person, setting out to design my third business oriented web site, and hoping to learn how to use CSS to make it all work better. Halfway through this tome I have learned nothing.Avoid it if you want to learn CSS."
2,This guy needs an editor: first impression,I've just begun the book and have already found numerous errors or problems that a competent editor would have caught and corrected. Schmitt does NOT write very well and needs help with his prose.Also note that the related website with examples from the book no longer exists.
3,"Not terrible, not great.","The book is okay. Its not as good as some others, but its not poorly done. The section on multiple column layouts was probably the best. Its not going to be the only book you buy on the subject or the one you go to first, but its not terrible to have for an occasional reference. Some of the constructs put forth in the book have since been replaced by the css wizards over at alistapart, so some of the techniques are a little dated & overly complex."
5,explaining CSS web pages,"I finally got CSS web pages explained. The book begins with an overview of html web pages and folds in the information about CSS web pages in a way that even a beginner can follow. I thought it was GREAT. The humorous style of the author helps to make a ""rather dry subject"" intersting. I would love the author to tackle other technical subjects."
4,jump in the CSS pool with a splash!,"Excellent overview of CSS. That said, the appendix of CSS delimiters is too brief in its description of each one.What was cool about the book is that it immediately got me coding, designing a CSS update to my website. What was uncool was that as soon as I started to branch out and explore new coding ideas, I found it very difficult to find out where I was going wrong when problems occurred. So now I'm shopping for more books!Again, though, an excellent overview and a very good stimulus for coding on your own."
1,Save Your Money,"I've been working in the computer business since 1984 and can honestly say this is the worst computer book I have ever seen. As you all know this is really saying something, as there are multitudes of poorly written book in our industry. The prose of this book approaches childishness at times. More to the point, the book is poorly edited with numerous errors and mistakes throughout. Many of the errors are inconsistencies between progressive code examples that often extend to the associated text. A full chapter is dedicated to technologies that are not yet available to any browsers. The book is simply not ready for publication. Save your money. I wish I could get mine back from Mr. Bezos."
2,Take note...,The companion website for this book no longer exists! Major turnoff for me. I'm returning the book tomorrow.
4,It opened my eyes to a world beyond HTML,"I agree there were many spelling typos but they were obvious and did affect the real meat of the topic. The real message of the book was how to have simple html markup styled by css in various ways. I loved the many examples,they were very nicely explained step by step with the code and the screen shot all close together. It showed how to do multi-column layout without html tables. I thought css just let you change fonts and colors but it is really so much more. I rarely read tech books all the way through, but this one I did."
4,Great Book But Not For Beginners,"This book is a great resource to move your knowledge of CSS ""to the next level,"" but I would not recommend it for someone who has never worked with CSS before. As suggested by the title of the book, it fairly quickly dives into using CSS to layout and design pages without much background on the how's and why's of CSS elements. Overall, a terrific book. I knew how to do very basic CSS (font manipulation) and this book helped me get into more advanced techniques (element positioning, page layout without using tables!)"
5,Excellent Primer,"I am an experienced Web Designer and 'HTML terrorist'. I've been hearing the buzz about CSS for so long but never really knew what it was. I thought it wasn't much more then a replacement for the <FONT> tag. After reading this book I have defiantly changed my mind.This book will get you thinking about CSS and give some good background and examples on why its the way Web Designers SHOULD be designing their sites. Its excellent reading to clear your senses on what CSS can offer and get your creative ideas flying.If you know nothing or very little about CSS this will give you the necessary background, and skills to start writing your first styles. Approach this book as a primer, and you will get the most out of it.It's about time inferior Web Practices that penalizes your users instead of rewarding them went the way of the Dodo."
1,Far more errata than the author admits,"Horribly written and contains far more errata than the author admits to on his website.Rattle this inside your melon for a while: ""Instead of beginning with the design as a means to get to the content, stylize the information you are trying to convey in terms of visual presentation by examining intensely at the message that got to you this point.""If anyone can parse this sentence, would you mind letting me in on it?It is followed immediately by this: ""Look at the tone of the material you have and how a visual design will best serve your client, your client's audience.""One cannot 'look' at the tone and of course ""your client, your client's audience"" should be ""your client and your client's audience"".New Riders should be ashamed of putting this book on the market unedited.Save your money until Molly Holzschlag's book on CSS is available later in March. It is bound to be better than 'Designing CSS Webpages'."
2,started off good but then failed to bring in the home run.,"Part one of the book starts off good, giving good advice on how to develop an all CSS page/site. Part two is a good introduction where he walks you through writing bits of CSS, and applying the css bit by bit to see the page take form. Part three through five was a big disappointment. From out of no where, the author delves into somewhat advanced javascipt and starts throwing up css w/out any additional walk throughs or explanations - he just refers you to buying some other book by another author. Very frustrating! I unfortunately don't fee I completely got my money's worth on this one :-("
1,Very Confusing,I found this book to be very confusing from the beginning. I stopped reading it and am returning it tomarow. They dont get specific with thier examples. Bad Book!
4,Who doesn' t love a Bulldog,"I bought these as a present for my best friend that has a Bulldog. She loves them and wears them all of the time. I might need to buy her another pair, before she wears these out!"
4,Adorable and Comfortable,"The shoes are made of very thin material, so they are very light weight and comfortable. Shipped fast."
3,A good (if not biased) story of Normandy,"As with most Osprey books, Normandy 1944 offers a concise description of its namesake. I was disappointed, however, with the POV of the author -- decidly British, thus focusing on General Montgomery and Caen. I recommend it for those who wish to learn about the battle outside of the Omaha and Utah beacheads."
4,A quick and dirty summary of Normandy,"We are taking a group of graduate students and professors to Normandy this year for a staff ride of the D-Day landings. This will be the required book for everyone, but supplemented by a long list of more detailed books. It is fabulous for a quick overview of what happened, and my favorite thing about Osprey books is the maps. The maps are worth the price by themselves. Not as good as other Osprey books I have used but still well worth the price as a visual supplement to your further readings."
4,This is D-Day...,"""Normandy 1944"" is a nice hardcover edition from the Osprey campaign series. Veteran British military historian Stephen Badsey is the author of what is a concise introduction to the Western Allies' invasion of Nazi-occupied France.The book follows the usual Osprey format, with an introduction on the origins of the battle, the opposing commanders, armies, and plans, and a narrative of the actual Battle of Normandy. His coverage extends from June 6 through late August 1944. Along the way, he offers some interesting commentary on command relationships and a few of the lingering controversies of the battle. Badsey writes from a British perspective, although his account is fairly well balanced.""Normandy 1944"" is highly recommended, even in used condition, as a compact introduction into one of history's decisive moments, suitable for the general reader or the student, and nicely illustrated with photographs, maps, graphics and other illustrations."
4,A great introduction to low-fat cooking,"After my husband had emergency heart bypass surgery and we were suddenly plunged into a low-fat lifestyle, I looked at almost every low-fat cookbook in print. This one is my favorite. There are full-page color photos and a complete nutritional analysis for each recipe. The recipes are easy and taste good, and don't use weird ingredients like pureed prunes or carob powder. The Lemon Meringue Cake with Strawberries was a big hit - I plan to try out the Chocolate Swirl Cheesecake, too. Overall, a very easy introduction to a different way of life."
5,Wonderfully Simple and Tasteful!,"This book is packed not only with yummy recipes but also with great information regarding Cholesterol, Fat, and Calories.Just tried the chocolate brownies and they are wonderful!!! They definitely don't taste low calorie and low cholesterol!Each recipe is listed as being either Low Fat, Low Cholesterol, and/or Low Calorie so no matter what your diet needs you'll find recipes you love. Most of the recipes are low in all 3 areas, even the desserts!!!This book is worth it for the nutritional information alone but please make sure and try the chocolate brownies!!!"
3,Disappointing,"The recipes in this book would not convert anyone to low fat, low cholesterol cooking. A more creative and tasteful collection can be found in the American Heart Association Low Fat, Low Cholesterol Cookbook."
5,"Easy, tasty recipes","When my husband found out his triglyceride level was dangerously high last month, I began shopping around for easy low-fat cookbooks. This one is as good as the original Betty Crocker cookbook. It has colorful pictures of each recipe, the ingredients are found in every grocery store, they are easy to make, and every single one we've tried has been good!"
3,"Ok, but not the best. I hope.","I needed to find a low cholesterol cookbook so that I could start amending my diet. I thought that this would be a nice start because it is a Betty Crocker cookbook. I would say that about half of the recipes I have tried so far are tasty. The other half are downright awful. The reference section is thorough and helpful. The pictures are large and colorful, a good guide to what the end results should be. We have had the most success with the breakfast section, and the least success with anything that includes pasta. Since my family already loves wheat pasta, this section should not have been such a problem. Overall, the cookbook will stay in the collection, but from now on I will be very picky about which recipes I choose from for family dinners."
3,Cookbook,I didn't find very many recipes that I would want to make. I was a little disappointed being from Betty Crocker.
4,Cookbook review,I have found several receipes in the cookbook that I have cooked and my family has enjoyed. I also had my mom try some and she ordered the cookbook for herself. The only thing that I would like to see would be to have alternates for people cooking for less and for people that don't tolerate a lot of spices.
4,Good healthy food,I enjoyed this cookbook because the recipes are low in cholesterol and taste good. My favorite is the Turkey Stroganoff. I replaced chicken once which worked out great. I recommend this to anyone who is watching their cholesterol or just trying to stay healthy.
2,"Tasty Recipes, But Not Much from Scratch","I found a few good recipes in this book (like guacamole and salsa), but for the most part, if you prefer cooking with whole foods, I'd stay away. There are a handful of really tasty recipes in here, but I'll probably only ever make about a quarter of what's in here."
3,this one is better than some,this one I'd have to say is better than the others i have bought but still I will most likely give away because its not worth using space on my bookshelf.
2,A waste of 1 hour in a 2 hour movie,"I liked the dialogues with Costner and Hurt. When you bring in Demi Moore as a tough cop, of course never tying her hair back or wearing loose clothing, it fails. The movie could have been 90 minutes; they just need to remove the Demi parts. I did not realize that all movies need to appeal to teenage boys."
1,Absolutely wretched.,"Out of 1000s of options at the vid store, I rented this last night, mainly on employee suggestion. My friend and I discussed turning it off at around the 30 minute mark, and unfortunately we did not, and plodded through it. This movie is so bad it's beyond belief. Moreover, William Hurt...what are you doing in this garbage ?!?! Costner I can understand, but you..."
1,Hard to Believe Just How Bad It Was,"If this is not the most disagreeable movie experience ever, it certainly ranks with the top three, and stands alone as the single worst viewing experience. The story almost saved itself before the horrible ending."
1,Evil Total Trash!,This is one of the worst movies that I have ever seen. Are Kevin Costner Demi Moore and William Hurt hard up for money or what? I could not believe this movie was released! It was total trash and the film makers that put this kind of movie out should be ashamed of them selves. Can't you come up with something that inspires people in the world? Does it have to be this kind of evil worthless total trash? If I ever run into any of these so called actors I will spit at them for being in this film! I used to be a fan of Kevin Costner Demi Morre and William Hurt! No more!Take some responsibility for what you do in your life! Donna Wencka in Tampa Florida
1,Should be taught in film school as.....,....one of the worst screenplays ever written. Unbelievable would be an understatement - what were they thinking (which might be a clue) - that they don't have a brain! Complete trash! Everyone collects their paycheck here - another example of what Hollywood has become - braindead!
1,Terrible quality.,This movie was from France then translated into English. Terrible!!! Needs also to be the uncut version which is what I actually ordered. Too much of a headache to send back.
3,Good Psychological Thriller,"This is actually a 3 1/2 star movie, and would have been 4 stars except for the totally unwelcome presence of Demi Moore, one of the least talented actresses around today. Her role was completely superfluous, and had it been completely cut from the film, the movie would have not lost anything. That being said, this is a very interesting concept and the performances by both Kevin Costner and William Hurt are excellent, all the more chilling because both downplay their roles. There are a couple of scenes where the violence is quite graphic, but most of the film dwells on the more interesting psychological aspects of the character."
2,Draggy.,"I like the genre, and I respect what this movie attempted. Perhaps it's because I don't like Kevin Costner, or perhaps it's because he was meant to be as uninteresting and unappealing as possible, but I found this movie to just drag and drag on. Another candidate for blame in making the movie an awkward and confused two hours: Demi Moore. Why? That's all I could think every time she appeared.The film seems undecided between making Moore a central focus, an almost equal or equal storyline, and relegating her to entire secondary status. It comes closer to the latter when it comes to screen-time -- but there's been no proportionate scaling down of script and plot. Moore plugs on with lines and scenes that suggest she's an equal lead but doesn't get the corresponding recognitions in other elements of production. The end result is that the movie seems busy and her attempts to give her character a fuller personality and more complex motives are distracting."
5,love it,"I wanted to see this move when it came out on the theater, but never had the time. I enjoyed all the evil things he made and his creepy subconcience"
3,Interesting character study,"We enjoyed this flick, it kept our interest throughout the film . We especially enjoyed the relationship between Mr. Hurt and Mr. Costner. The movie is definitely dark and leaves you thinking about the ""why's"" of the characters and the next generations. A possible prequel, or Mr. Brooks 2? If you enjoy thrillers, and a little gore then take a chance on the film."
3,Two Hours to Kill,"Maybe I've gotten spoiled. I can appreciate the obvious talent that the main actors (Kevin Costner, Demi Moore and Dane Cook) have shown in previous movies, but aside from the occassional glimmer this particular movie provided it seemed a rather run-of-the-mill nicely funded flick. The kind of thing you watch one afternoon when you can't think of anything better to do than to kill a couple of hours. Out of the three, Demi Moore seemed to do the better job of becoming her character. I guess maybe I was just hoping for more thrills. For that in recent movies, I'd recommend ""Shutter Island"" instead."
3,Mr. Brooks DVD Review,"A good movie, which would have been even a lot better if it had a more appropriate and suspenseful musical score."
2,it was ok,"the film was interesting,but predictable. Kevin Costner was cool and William Hurt was interesting in a Anthony Hopkins kind of vibe. Dane cook just didn't show me much in this film and Demi Moore's was ok,but the film tried to take on way too many things and just was all over the place. too many storylines and not any real answers. this film should have been really good,but it fell over it's ownself before it got going. this film reminded me so much of the Showtime show ""Dexter"" except Dexter catches who he is after. this film just leaves alot of tracks but so many things are left with a question mark."
3,I nice change in the genre.,"This IS Kostner's best performance. And, the serial killer thriller has a fresh approach with some stable tried and true twists. I'm not actually a fan of this genre and I rented it because nothing else was good at Red Box. I'm glad I did. Might even buy it when it hits the 5 dollar bin."
5,My wife is a great fan of Kiven,It musr be a great movie because my wife has watched it several times. I would say it is avery good movie. Kiven is a very good actor.
5,Scary good,"Kevin Costner, Dane Cook, Bill Hurtand the young girl all did a great job acting.Marg Helgenberger's role was pretty limited, butshe looked good. A few shocking scenes."
3,Wasn't as good as you might think.,"Feeling generous I might give it three stars, but it only deserves 2 1/2. The problem was I can't figure out to tag the half-star."
2,Failing to Deliver,"""Mr Brooks"" was a disappointing film. It had a good cast with Kevin Costner and Demi Moore in lead roles and a wonderful co-starring role for William Hurt as the alter ego to Mr Brooks. In fact, the film started well but thereafter fell apart.My major criticism of the film is that it just became plain implausible and far too contrived. Perhaps many people are credulous and just accepted the plot. I couldn't manage this part. By the time the film ended, I felt relieved. Murder had been heaped upon murder with each twist of the plot becoming increasingly unrealistic.Overall, given the quality of the cast, this film left me feeling cheated. Potentially, it had much to offer but, in the end, delivered little."
1,A Morally Deranged Film.,"_Mr. Brooks_ is a film which glorifies killing. The killing in this film is not done for a higher purpose, it is not done in self-defense, it is done purely ""for pleasure"". Kevin Costner, who plays the killer, is made to appear cool and suave. His character is made to appear likeable and noble. As such, I cannot recommend this film because I find its general premise disgusting."
4,smart serial killer; dumb cop,"If it hadn't been for the dumbest cop ever born (the one played by Demi Moore), this would have gotten one more star.Anyway, Costner does a marvelous job as a tormented serial killer addicted to thrill killing while also holding down a great job and doting on his wife and daughter. The daughter, however, may be a budding serial killer herself, and he wants to save her from becoming like her father.William Hurt also is in full creepy mode as a manifestation of Costner's dueling personality, while comedian Dane Cook plays a would-be killer who wants Costner to tutor him in how to do it and not get caught.There is some intrusive techno music and a Matrix-like hallway shoot-out that could have been done better. However, these are quibbles. I had a bigger problem with Moore's distracting divorce battle, impulsiveness, and general arrogance."
3,"Half Good, Half Bad","It started off really interesting in an American Psycho kind of way, but then it just seemed like everyone was or wanted to be a killer.I must say that Kevin Costner and William Hurt put on a very good show. Demi Moore and Dane Cook are simply miscast in my opinion. Danielle Panabaker plays the same character she does on the television show Shark, but she is cute as a button, so she has that going for her. Mr. Brooks never really bored me, but some of the dialogue and situations seemed too unrealistic. The hallway shootout towards the end is a fine example of this. When did Demi enter the Matrix? You'll know what I mean when you see it.Overall, not a bad film, but one to wait for on DVD."
4,suspense,I have never seen Kevin Costner play a role like this one and I enjoyed it from begining to end....great movie....I loved it....
3,diffrent than expected,"to me this wa way better than anthony hopkins ""fracture"" jim carries ""number 23"" and hally barry ""pefrect strangers"" but not no moive of year or anything. i jumped quite a few times thought it kept my full attention all though a few scenes i was a little loss on"
3,Imaginative thriller,"Not your usual run of the mill serial killer film. This has shades of alfred Hitchcock and Dexter all rolled into one. Costner is man who is addicted to killing, fueled by his alter ego, william hurt, who only he can see and converse with. Demi Moore is the detective on the case, and Dane Cook is the only witness to his lates crime, and trying to blackmail him by asking him to teach him to kill. All in all a decent film that manages to keep your attention."
5,Mr. Brooks,"Mr. Brooks arrived on the date is set to, in new condition, and is an excellent movie.The only comment I have is GREAT!"
4,Good deal,"Loved this movie, but couldn't find it for sale in my traditional places. Found it here and it was cheap so it was a great deal. Shipping was painless, came when it was supposed to. Was a little disappointed that it has a blockbuster cover, but also that I didn't think to look there. Overall good experience with this purchase."
5,I liked it,"I liked it. what's the fuss?entertaining, kept my interest. even jumped a few times. had some humor, some surprises, boobs, blood, tension, intrigue.I liked Mr. B and his imaginary friend. and liked the wife, the kid, the cop, the weird neighbor - Mr. S.surprised me at the end. lots of twists. lots of new things that kept it interesting.great pop-corn, cuddle on the sofa, Saturday night, no kids home flick. not for kids under 17 says Gramma Sally!thanks. sweet dreams!"
4,The voice in the back seat,"This is a most clever murder mystery thing, with enough surprises and twists to keep you glued to your lazy boy. John Hurt is always a pleasure, and he gets to dig in deep into a very different character. It's good to see Kevin Costner in a subdued but powerful role. Demi Moore has a role where she can ""act out"" as a trait of her character, something she is good at. This fim is enjoyable and intriguing."
3,Finally under actors unite!,"To put it plainly I had to watch this film just to see the two greatest under-actors of their generation get emotional, William Hurt and Kevin Costner. The movie is mostly unmemorable but it is still very entertaining for its genre, which is a psychodrama character study of sorts. If I were to buy this movie its simply to see Hurt and Costner exchange lines again the plot and supporting cast were to weak to make this movie a ""4 star"" or higher."
4,"Wasn't What I Expected, But It Still Rocked","I was certain Mr. Brooks would get caught in the end, so that was my first surprise. The second was seeing Kevin Costner playing a bad guy. Despite being an evil serial killer, he was still a ""nice guy"" evil serial killer. Costner just can't shake his everyman nice-guy image, even when he plays such a despicable character.I guess my favorite part was when he helped Demi Moore with a personal problem. Plus, the way it ended with the dream was a nice little twist. How Costner took care of business (as in a frame) contradicted what I expected to happen. That said, this was a pretty good ride and I recommend it."
2,Kevin Costner as a serial killer?,"I ask you. Can you imagine clean-cut Kevin Costner as a calculative serial killer? Can you imagine the eclectic and cerebral William Hurt as the intellectually aggressive alter-ego of said serial killer? Well... maybe! But can you see comedian Dane Cook as the over-zealous protege of a serial killer? Last but not least, imagine the dishie Demi Moore as the romantically disgruntled intuitive investigator on the chase. Please!!! Without revealing the storyline, if you can imagine that cast of characters in those roles you may enjoy this movie. If, however, you are a fan of good casting, you may want wait until this movie hits HBO or Showtime before you buy it."
4,Mr. Brooks,"The film is one of my favorites.....I'm not a Kevin Costner fan per se, but I did like him in this one. I was happy to find the DVD on Amazon at a good price. Thanks."
3,Commercials!!!,"Fantastic cooking as one would expect from Monsieur Pepin. However, the commercials throughout are obnoxious, and disappointing given the price of this item. At the beginning of each episode, Jaques' shameless use of the sponsor's food processor cheapens his performance considerably. Tant pis!"
1,Pay to see commercials beside the recipes.,I have always enjoy Jacques Pepin cooking. I was very annoyed to discover that there were so much commercial ads content present in this video. I pay for this in full and there is no subsidy by commercial company so why do I have to force watch commercials in it is beyond me.Apart from that I love the simplicity of Pepin's recipe. Easy to follow recipe is the best and this dvd has many. I will enjoy better minus the commercials.
5,Amazing French Chef!,"If you are not familiar with Jacques Pepin you should be!!! His baking & cooking methods are essential for good technique. I can't say enoughabout this amazing chef. He has taught me so manyways to make perfect french bread, perfect desserts and entrees. All of his videos are worthbuying!"
4,works great on Honda Pilot,"The utility trailer I tow, is level with this straight ball mount. I found I needed to put a little more weight forward on the trailer to stop the ""chucking"" (up and down clanking) that I noticed when the weight was centered on the trailer."
5,Great!,Bought this for my daughter for Christmas to hold her wireless transmitter for her head microphone. She sings and dances so the transmitter needed to stay attached while she danced. Straps are a good length and seems to fit well. Can go under clothing without being noticable. Holds the transmitters firm and doesn't fall out.
5,No heresy to tout this book as one of Peters's best!,"One of Peters's best plots. Despite Cadfael's absence in the middle of the narrative, this chronicle kept my attention. This is a deeply religious experience as Peters examines some of the origins of Christian dogma through her characters. As always it is Peters's style that sets it above the common mystery. Trurly one of the best of the Cadfael series."
4,One of the Better Cadfaels,"I enjoyed this Brother Cadfael story. It has a lot of the standard parts that one finds in this series, but with some interesting twists. It is one of the better ones of the series."
2,Flat Inverted Theology,"This is not a book I can recommend. There was no depth of character, or plot. I expected some twists and turns, but it was all predictable. The characters are indelibly flat. Of greatest disappointment were the heresies, for the author just seems to pass by them as unimportant. There are some major Pelagian defects in the thoughts of one of the protagonists, and the magnitude of the defects is swept aside by the characters we are meant to bond with, who decide in favor of the heresy through simple platitudes! The primary character, Cadfael, seems to contribute but little to the book or the mystery, and I found great difficulty in caring for any of these characters at all."
1,A good value at $1.29,"If you want a rubber spatula that's rather small, with an inflexible blade and a thin, rough wooden handle -- and you don't mind paying four times what it ought to sell for, then this is the spatula for you. IMO everyone else should look for a better product or a lower price."
1,I Should Have Paid Attention to Your Face,"Horrible. I did not not like the face on the album cover. I should have been sensitive to my own first reaction. This album is incoherent. It is something that you might ""imagine"" Yoko Ono doing. If you happen to like incoherent, improvisational jazz, you might find something redeeming in this tracks. I could find nothing that I liked. Period. My worst purchase in a long, long time. Going to the used CD store immediately ... hopefully they will give me 25 cents on the dollar, if I am lucky."
3,Keep the Spear Burning,"This really isn't all that bad. Yes, the sound isn't all that great. If you have 5.1 surround or better, this won't do much for you. As for the show, it's a great performance from the band recorded at the Vermont Reggae Festival. Having been to this festival a bunch of times, I can tell you it's always a good time. Winston and the band seem to be having quite a good time on stage, and it's well shot. Great setlist with classics like ""Columbus"", ""Marcus Garvey"" ""Days of Slavery"" and more. I picked it up for 8 dollars and it was money well spent. Yes, the sound is below par, but the footage and the show are not. Worth getting. Unlike the ""Back to My Roots"" DVD, you get the full concert here. For years now, Burning Spear has been releasing CD's and DVD's on his own, away from major labels. If the sound was mixed in 5.1, this would be 4 stars for sure."
3,Calidad mediana a baja,"Compre este DVD porque Burning Spear es un gigante del reggae. Al ver las especificaciones decia que el audio no era el mejor y que habia sido filmado en un festival. Revise lo que decian otros compradores y tienen razon: Las canciones son buenas, puedes emocionarte, pero la calidad del video y el audio no es buena. Ademas de eso, la ocasion, el concierto, es mas parecido a una feria o algo, mucha gente que no tiene ni idea de que hace la banda alli. El estrado es pequeño, en fin, comprenlo si es que son capaces de obviar un sonido mediocre. La calidad de Burning Spear, su dominio del publico y demas cualidades que lo han convertido en un clasico no se reflejan en este DVD. Una pena."
3,Somewhat disappointing for a Burning Spear Concert,"This concert has a few problems. First, Burning Spear's vocals are not loud enough in comparison to his band. Second, his band sucks! While Burning Spear sounds pretty good, and he sang some good songs, his band was NOT on the same page. His band sounded like they were trying to be a jazz band, not a roots reggae band, and it threw off the whole concert! The lead guitarist was especially bad and jazz-like. I recommending buying the ""South Africa/Live in Pariz Zenith"" DVD before you buy this one. The Paris concert in that DVD was so much better than this concert."
3,"I originally gave this 1 star, but I admit that I was wrong....a must have!","I gave this a single star rating when I first watched it (the video quality isn't very good at all, but the sound is decent). I love the play list on this one, and Burning Spear really sounds fantastic. This one took a little while to grow on me, but I do recommend it for any roots lover out there. Rastafari!!!"
5,It works!! No more static getting in/out of the car,"My Subaru has always gave me a static shock when I would leave the car and then go to close the door. Is it caused by the static built up from me getting up and out of the car? Probably. I went back and forth on trying this for years but always thought of it as ""Snake Oil."" I saw a parade of police vehicles go by one day and noticed that all (must have been 40 police vehicles) had them. That convinced me to give it a try. I found an easily accessible (and long enough)bolt under my car that I could use and the whole job took under 5 minutes.6 Month follow up: Its been 15,000 miles and its still holding strong. The last 3 inches does drag on the ground but there has been very minimal wear since it does ""float"" when at higher freeway speeds."
4,"Best Claire Burke ""flavor""","I purchased this multi-pack of Claire Burke Frangrance Warmer Refills in the Original scent to go with the Warmer Plug-Ins I purchased (Claire Burke Electric Fragrance Warmer Plug-In). I was excited to be able to find both at Prime eligible sellers since I cannot find them locally anymore.This scent, if you have never smelled it, is a warm noted scent that is reminiscent of aromatic pipe tobacco, cedar and a bit of lavender (I know this isn't how the manufacturer describes it but that's what it smells like to me). It's very clean smelling, not floral-y at all. It has always been my favorite Claire Burke home fragrance.The only reason I didn't give it a five star rating is because the Warmer Plug-in these are used with could give off a bit more fragrance, it kind of gets lost in a larger room (see my review of the Warmer Plug-ins for more details including room sizes)."
4,INDISPENSIBLE JAMAICAN HARMONY,"After purchasing the Heptones' first full-length album ""On Top"", I was sure that there could be nothing else in their catalog that could compare. Happily, I was wrong. ""Fattie Fattie"" is more of the same. The three-part employed on this album is the most intimate, subtle group vocalizing (sans proselytising) you'll find in Jamaican music this side of early Wailers. The title track is great - how can you find fault with a song that begins with, ""I need a fat girl""? Get In The Groove is an early version of dub that came as a total surprise. It is difficult to choose a favorite track on this record; it is IMPOSSIBLE to pick a sub-par track. Check this out if you love street corner soul harmonies over a rocksteady rhythm. The Heptones are not well-known in America (outside of the West Indian community & Jamaican music afficionados) but anyone who appreciates rocksteady will be overjoyed to discover both ""Fattie Fattie"" and ""Heptones On Top""."
2,not so great condition!,"I bought this book used, it said it was in ""good"" condition. I had never bought anything used from Amazon before, but I thought Id give it a try. I got the book and it smelled really bad. It honestly smelled like an old persons home! The cover had several tears on it as well. Not very happy with it."
5,Ancient Israelite Religion,"This is readable, and a useful tool for becoming familiar with the ancient Israelite religion written by a well-known biblical scholar."
2,Don't waste your money,"In the Accidental Hermit, Murchie tries a little too hard to be clever. The laughs, such as they are, are stale and predictable. She could have brought an interesting perspective to a situation many dream of, but was too busy trying to be funny. I was disappointed and wish I'd just looked at this book in the library rather than buy it."
2,too small,"The Dover Fine Art Stickers books are very small: about 6""x4"", containing 4 pages of 4 stickers each. The stickers are okay in appearance, but are small, each less than 3""x2"", and when peeled away from their backing sheet do not have a great deal of adhesive power."
1,Disappointing,"When my favorite sifter finally wore out after years of use, I was happy to find an identical one still available. However, I quickly found out that it only looked the same. The spring mechanism was too weak to allow the sifting blades to return to position after squeezing the handle when using more than a half cup or so of flour. After less than a dozen uses, the plastic part which attached the spring to the blade broke. Unfortunately, it appears as though Kaiser has instituted the same sort of ""cost takeout"" process used by many companies to maximize profits at the expense of quality."
2,Plastic...,"This can be a good sifter if only Kaiser does not use plastic for the movable parts... alas, mine can be jammed easily if I fill the cup to half its height and the reason is because the plastic ""stick"" that links the squeezing handle and the rotary can be bent pretty easily.I would say that if you only want to sift a small amount of confectioners' sugar onto pastries, then this sifter is fine. However, I personally would not recommend this sifter over any others I have used. (i.e., get something else...)"
2,get an old fashioned sifter,"I've had this sifter for about 15 years. I bought it at Kitchen Etc. The sifter never worked correctly from the start. You squeeze the handle and the blades move but they don't retract because it get stuck on the part that connects the handle to the blade. It doesn't seem bent or anything. So what I ended up doing was squeezing the handle just a little bit (1 cm) very quickly so that it sort of works but it can be tiring.This morning I'm making pancakes and having to use the sifter for the confectioner sugar. I'm just fed up with it that I'm on Amazon to get a new sifter (I'm going to get the old fashioned one, Mrs Anderson 3 cup sifter with crank) along with some new steak knives.The only positive about this sifter is that it still looks good 15 years later. No sign of rust, the screens are in good shape. I've put it in the dishwasher without any issues."
2,Never really entered my rotation,I thought I'd like this but it's almost flavor less to me. All I can say is that the music is experimental (not all experiments work) and hazy (like my recollection of this band).
4,Sturdy Ball,"I recommend to use a ball pump instead of the pump that comes with the exercise ball.It took awhile to pump the ball. It was deceiving at first, thinking that it was a smaller sized balled they gave us, but if you pump the ball enough, it'll eventually stop growing at 21"", actual size of the ball.It's pretty sturdy. Only starting to use it now, but so far so good."
4,Gets the job done.,"You get everything just like the picture shows. The actual ball was a little different than I expected, but it gets the job done and seems to be of quality."
3,Back to basics,"I bought this to make portable my toddler's lullaby music, so I wasn't much interested in the headphone aspect. Its compact size is good, the radio sounds better than the tape. Tapes sound really ""tinny"" but my 2-year-old doesn't notice. However, tapes sound better with the headphones. It's pretty basic and wasn't oversold on that point. Count me as 3.5 stars, but there weren't half stars on the scale."
4,V-E-R-Y Tricky,The previous reviews cover the darkness of this score pretty thoroughly. But I'll add another observation. Read the title's first letters in sequence. VEC-BATMAN-MCI. Huh?
5,wow...,"I couldn't possibly hope to write a review as eloquent as most of the others. I gather that I'm not the typical listener of music of this genre.There's really not much I can say about this soundtrack. Its artistry is beyond what words can describe, but how ""beautiful"" and ""magnificant"" will suffice.I've been a fan of Hans Zimmer since I bought the Gladiator soundtrack, on a whim. The pure enjoyment I've gotten out of the countless times I've listened to this CD, since I firt bought it, makes it probably my favorite of all of the CD's I own."
5,Beautiful music!,"I watched this movie twice, and in my opinion it's the best from other batman movies. The music is excellent, but it would be nice to hear some bytes through amazon."
3,batman,"Great score, disappointing length...It feels like its missing some of the big movements. Probably in the mixing, but still enjoyable."
4,HANS ZIMMER IS THE BEST IN THE GAME,"First of all, hans zimmer is the greatest film composer in the game right now! He compares to JayZ which compares to John willams! THe man who said Hanz Zimmer isnt a composer, is retarted! Im sorry for being honest! I personally saw Mr. Zimmer and Mr.Howard make this production and i believe they did a good job! Liked the movie, liked the soundtrack, but could have been a little better to become 5 stars. Best soundtrack of all times i believe is ""GLADITOR"""
3,Why?,"All the discussion about both composers' contributions overlooks one question: why did this film need two composers to create its music? Zimmer has worked with others before but all of them were with his company, Media Ventures. Howard is not in that category. And this question relates to what happened to Zimmer on Kingdom of Heaven? He was announced as the composer but in the end Harry Gregson-Williams did it? What's going on with Hans, my favorite composer?I thought the music here was interesting and occasionally haunting, but it seems to work better within the film as opposed to on a CD."
5,Just as good...,"I bought the CD right after I saw the film and the only time I do that is if the movie and the soundtrack are on the same level. I don't care about the bad reviews. A lot of people liked the movie and so did I. Even more amazing is that the score is just as good as the film, like James Newton Howard and Hans Zimmer watched it first without any music and then writing the music based on how the characters felt during a specific sequence. The result is a dark, brooding, air-tight score that doesn't only sound great in the movie theatres but also inside your car if you are one to listen to neo-classical-oriented musical juggernauts."
5,Excellent Score,"I love Hans Zimmer, and I think that this collection really embraces the mood of the Batman movie. Very angsty. It is unlike Zimmer's recent releases; it is much darker, less empirical. Excellent all around, as it tells a story in and of itself."
3,"Good music, but......","..they left out some of the best parts from the movie!!! Where's the ending score? The music at the ending credits was the best of all. What happened to the music during the scene on the train and the death of Ducard? Had I known this to be the case I would not have purchased it? For the the music itself I give 5 stars, but I have to subtract two stars for the CD and the missing music. I can only hope that there is a future ""extended"" edition in the works."
5,ABSOLUTELY AMAZING,"As a dynamic soundtrack collector, I must say that Batman Begins is one of my all time favorite scores. With the combination of Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard, how could anything go wrong?The score is dark, scary, beautiful, and full of action all at the same time. It has awesome synthetic base added to some songs which I happen to love very much.IT SHOULD BE UP FOR SCORE OF THE YEAR, THAT SHOULD GIVE YOU SOME IDEA OF HOW GOOD IT IS. WHEN I SAW THE LIST AND THIS WAS NOT ON IT I YELLED AND CURSED THE OSCAR IDIOTS. THEN I GLANCED DOWN TO NOTICE THAT NEITHER KING KONG, STAR WARS, BATMAN BEGINS, HARRY POTTER, NOR THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA WAS ON IT. I AM UTTERY AMAZED AT THE OSCAR FAILURE THIS YEAR.I HOPE YOU BUY AND ENJOY THIS SCORE AS I KNOW YOU WILL"
1,AWEFUL!!!,"From the overly precocious track titles to the absolute lack of memorable themes, this is possibly the worst Batman soundtrack since Nelson Riddle's theme music in the 1960's TV show. The bass line throughout sounds like it was ripped off directly from Mozart's Symphony No 40, and the rest is just mood music which rumbles around in the background. I don't get any excitement or chills, but just laughs at how amateurish this score sounds. I expected nothing more from Mr. Zimmer, though. Too bad the next one has him at the helm again. I just wish they would bring back Danny Elfman, or put some other more accomplished film composer in the driver's seat. Zimmer should have stuck with the British techno scene...Long and short of it is, save your money, this one just isn't worth it..."
1,"Batman begins is bad, you music is very bad","The music is bad, the film es very bad. Warner is killer of Batman leyends. Puajj."
