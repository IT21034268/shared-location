5,This book has helped a lot.,"I'm 60 pounds overweight on a 5'2"" frame. This book is helping me get the proper exercise without hurting my joints."
2,Book on water aerobics,"This book is okay if you want an introduction to water aerobics. The illustrations are drawings. A short book. A few good ideas for workouts are here. I suggest you look at other books on the subject to learn more. Like the title suggests 78 exercises, and little more."
4,Didn't know what to expect but it was a great help,"I bought this book to help devise a workout program to help me get fit, manage diabetes and lose weight. I wasn't crazy about getting into a bathing suit but I had to do something and developing arthritis in my knees made walking a less attractive choice. Getting in the pool has been a real boon. I started out with the basic exercises but this book allowed me to expand that with specific exercises that help keep the routines from getting boring. I don't mind the line drawings. I just need information on how to do it and the type of illustration doesn't matter. I especially like the routines for specific injuries or problems. It isn't fancy but it's informative."
5,One great book,This is a great book. The only one any one will ever need wanting to start any type of water exercises or therepy. Great detailed picturesthat show you exactly what to do. This book is good for the beginner as well as the advanced water exerciser. I shared it with my therepist and she thought it was a great book too. She even incorporated some of the exercises into our program.
5,EXERCISE IN WATER,"THIS IS A GREAT BOOK. THE ILLUSTRATIONS ARE GOOD, AS ARE THE EXPLANATIONS. I DO WATER AEROBICS, AND THIS HAS DIFFERENT EXERICSE. NOT TOO CUMBERSOME."
3,UWS TBD72 truck tool bos,"Built quite well. The only thing that needs improvemnet is the assembly part.The hinges were rivited on and they were not tight to the box. This caused thelids to be crooked and on the latch side in front has a 1"" space in front and the backis tight to the box. I'm going to redo the lids and get the hinge tight to thebox, this should line the lid stright on the box. I think UWS could do a little betterjob of assembly. Other wise this is a wll built box."
4,Every software tester should read this book!,William Perry hits on many aspects of software testing and how it is impacted by other phases within the software development life cycle. This is one book that anyone involved in the testing arena needs to read. The success of test group cannnot continue without Perry's ideas.
2,Unreadable,"I read the first chapter, and am tempted to throw the book out. The author cannot write a clear English sentence to save his life."
3,400 thread count sheets,"These sheets are nice, but average for the price. They are beyond wrinkled every time I take them out of the dryer and they tend to stay looking wrinkled (except pillow cases). But they are soft and I like the look of them. I'm not disappointed by this purchase, but next time I'll spend a little more $$ and get high thread count sheets from a department store."
5,Very Informative Book,"This book is very informative and interesting to read, for either preachers or people who are interested in the Bible. This book is written by chockful of good Theological writers for New Testament studies who are also good speakers. Any student going to seminary school should try this one. Check this book out!"
5,Cool!!!!,I gave this product 5 stars and I'm glad to be able to find the series. Delivery was fast and it came brand new. I would recomend this to any anime collector. Another great ABe product!
1,all about drugs,The author wants you to believe that he has had this wonderful enlightened journey reaching a new spiritual level. Actually it's a story of someone taking native mind altering drugs and trying to make you believe it is more than just a chemical reaction.
2,Not that good,Was sad for too long for me. Needed something to go right.Not as good as the first two books
5,Jarrow Trilogy,Read all three books one after the other. An amazing author who has the reader hooked from page one. This author is definitely on my top 10 list.
5,Child of Jarrow,"A very worthwhile read as good as the first book very hard to put down,now reading the last one in trilogy and loving that to."
5,"Beautiful women, semi-plausible plot","I don't expect much from the types of movie my husband watches. But then again, there are films like ""Amazon Jail"" that pique my interest and make me look. Well, I'm glad I looked at this one, because there were at least ten beautiful-body, beautiful-face women (without gigantic implants!) on screen. And it showed them to be strong and plotting against their oppressors, an older couple. True, the Oppressor Man had a horrible, 1970's mustache, but that didn't take away from my enjoyment of the film. The story and the lovely ladies carried it. You should definitely give this one a chance."
1,Garbage DVD - junk quality,$29.95 for this load of junk is way too much. Only extra is a bad trailer. Lousy quality. I won't buy any Blue Underground garbage again.
1,No use !,"Don't buy this book! Its useless, neither for beginners nor for advanced people(anyway). I went thru this book in couple of hours, found ridiciolous simple mistakes in it, Book has ""for Syntheis"" in its name but found so many rubbish pages full with some stupid simulation results. Well, one can find better docs on the Net just for free, instead of buying this book."
2,After Years of Waiting,"Considering the people who made this film (which I have tried to find or even a showing), I was expecting something as great as the work they have done on other projects. Maybe it's dated and I've seen the message too many times since, but I was very disappointed. I could go on scene by scene, but I will spare you that. Even the song (which I first found pleasant and haunting),eventually made me yell in my head ""STOP ALREADY!"". I wish I had seen this when it was released - maybe I would of viewed it a lost treasure."
4,Pretty good,"I checked this book out of the library, but a few pages were ripped out, so technically my review is not a complete review. Nevertheless, the book was a good intro into the history of gunships. It briefly steps you through the AC-47, AC-130, AC-119 (which did actually come out later than the AC-130, despite the fact that the C-119 was a much older airframe than the C-130), and a few more small scale planes that were ""converted"" into some sort of gunship.Also mixed in are a few stories of going on missions with the aforementioned planes. There were a few examples of the AC-47 smoking a few NVA's and there were some stories of AC-130 missions.Recommended for anyone interested in C-130's, close-air support, Vietnam airpower, or Air Force planes in general."
3,Spooky,This was a great find for me. My husband was very pleased with the quality and condition of the book. Thanks Amazon.
4,Great weekend fun!,"This book has long been a part of my weekend life here in central Wisconsin. It has been a blast traveling around the state and looking first hand at what is found in the pages of ""Ghost Towns of Wisconsin"".As an example... The location of the ghost town ""Gratiot's Grove"", it's just 3-4 miles south of Schullsburg just south-east of the intersection of Rennick Rd. and Cty. Hwy U. There are still some cellar holes visible and if you use your imagination, you can see where the city roads were using the size of the massive oaks as an indication. I found Gratiot's Grove using the book. There is also the Gratiot house which is on the north side of Rennick Rd. It's the 4th oldest private wooden structure in all of Wisconsin. It had partially burned sometime in the 1930's but the main structure is still intact."
3,Hero was just toooo strange........,"The first half of the book is all about the relationshp with the hero's brother, and then when the relationship between the h and H begins, the hero doesn't speak. He almost seemed to be autistic, not traumatized and don't think that was the author's intention. Seemed like a missed opportunity here but it just took too long for there to even be any real dialogue."
3,The Mini-Me Beatle...,"What begins as a touching memoir of a father/son relationship eventually rings false. I had a hard time believing some of the dialogue from the seven year old son. We are supposed to believe the son had developed deep emotional insights from listening to the Beatles over the course of what seems like only a few months. The author has created a fantasied ego projection of the ideal son, one that shares his love of the Beatles. Instead of ""Two of Us"", a more apt title would be ""I Me Mine""."
3,Essential? Yes! Comprehensive? No!,"This is a concise, if not thorough, collection. All the big hits are here. In fact, only three of the Shondells Top 40 hits (""It's Only Love,"" ""I Like the Way"" and ""Do Something To Me"") are missing. In addition you get James' lone solo Top 10 hit ""Draggin' the Line."" [Footnote: James was still only 24 when ""Draggin the Line"" was a hit--he was only 16 when he first recorded his biggest single ""Hanky Panky""!] Like other Essentials releases, Rhino has simply taken an earlier compilation (in this case 1990's 27-track Anthology) and repackaged the material. This is only an improvement if you want nothing but the big radio hits--and they're all here, but at 35 minutes my only complaint is that the lesser hits weren't also included."
4,great pop collection by one of the best singles bands of the 60's,"'mony mony', 'hanky panky', 'i think we're alone now', these were all early great Tommy James hits included on this cd. Then cam 'crimson and clover', 'sweet cherry wine', 'crystal blue persuasion', 'gotta get back to you' and the odd but likeable 'ball of fire' are also included on this cd. Tommy James wrote great pop singles and delivered them like he was delivering a great song. This is what probably made Tommy James a great pop songwriter, he wasn't too ambitious and seemed happy with creating great singles. So if you want all of these singles on one cd remastered, this cd is for you. Pleasant music for listening to while driving."
4,Excellent Nostalgia,"The Tommy James CD arrived on time and was everything I thought it would be. I was missing ""Crystal Blue Persuasion"" from my library. It brought back a lot of memories from late night studies in College listening to music in the background. This was one of my favoritese."
5,MUY ACTUALIZADAS!,"Y hay programas de dietas para todos los gustos ,YO las voy vambiando y no me fastidio...Y SON EFICACES EN SERIO !"
1,Just another low carb diet.,"This is just another low carb diet with minor variations from Atkins, Zone, South Beach, etc.... It allows no room for error. I have tried all of these low carb diets and they are not for me. They are very restrictive (when do I ever get to eat a cheeseburger, pasta or a milkshake ever again???), and I cannot live my life like that. For an easier plan that allows you to have some carbs everyday and makes every Sunday a ""cheat"" day, check out Franco Carlotto's book ""Carb Cycle"". I've been able to stick to the Carb Cycle diet plan and have lost weight on it."
2,diet book difficult for me to use.,I purchased this book with high hopes of help to get new methods/recipes for losing weight. I read the theory behind it carefully and did some of the recipes. Many of the recipes needed products that were difficult to find without a health food store. I ordered some and eventually started a different diet that was much easier to use. I was successful in following it and lost the weight needed.
1,How can you eat this stuff?,"Like the rest of the reviewers, I have tried most diets over the years. From low carb to low fat, from protein-sparing drinks to fat burning soups. Few of the diet plans have delicious recipes but most are palatable. Most of the recipes in this book are either tasteless or disgusting. One would have to believe in sadistic self-torture to eat this stuff. In particular, such recipes as Nutola should be declared illegal. If you lose weight on this diet, it will be a testament to the resilience of your stomach and colon. Please try some other plan."
1,Bunch of slop,"I've only bought two diet books in my life and this one was pathetic. If you are an informed health and consumer, there is absolutely nothing new in this book for you to learn.There are three food groups: proteins, fats and carbs. Like most diet books today, when you toss out carbs you leave the other two. This book says eat all you want of the fats but make that good fats-avocados, yada, yada, yada. No chicken skin, lean turkey, no pork. Trust me, move on and don't buy this book."
2,atkinslike,"Being brief. It is atkin's like. I don't think eating that much fat is good for a person. I never really got into it. Try YOU on a diet. by michael f. roizen and Mehmet oz, it's an amazing diet. It works. I wish I could return the book."
4,Interesting but complicated,"This is a very interesting book and based on research. I liked reading it. But the recipes were sometimes a bit too much work. I can't think of many people who would have the time to cook the way they suggest at lunch time. A section on quick and easy menu choices would better suit most people's lifestyles. Also, the web site mentioned on the back of the book, where I went looking for more suggestions, was not available without a password."
3,"If all other diets have failed, try this one.","The Rosedale Diet BookThis diet works. It is the only book that makes it clear that excess protein can be turned into sugar and then into fat. Like all good things, it comes with work, but when all else has failed, this one will work for you."
1,don't waste your time,"Read Mastering Leptin by Byron Richards. It gives the scientific research conducted regarding leptin, which The Rosedale Diet is sorely lacking. The Rosedale Diet seemed to me to be a ""fad diet book"", whereas Mastering Leptin is an informative book on how the body is utilizing food for health and balance with all the research behind it! Again, don't waste your time or money on The Rosedale Diet......I did!"
1,Hopelessly impractical,"The diet is an Atkins variation, more limiting and restrictive with fists full of supplements to take that he sells. It also comes with the usual dietary myths, i.e. after 6 weeks of no carbs, no sweets, no fruits, no starchy veggies, you'll adjust and be repulsed by the dessert tray and your palate will awaken to the full range of flavors found in celery...... Don't count on it.The diet leaves you with very very limited choices (spinach and almond salad 5x week?). No question weight loss will follow. I just don't believe anyone with the tremendous willpower to follow this diet would need it. Few people would be satisfied on a permanent diet of limited lean meat and green leafy vegetables."
1,Kindle price shouldn't be same or higher than paperback price,"Publisher collusion (not Amazon's fault): The Kindle price for this book (at the time of this writing) is higher than the physical book price. The only explanation for this is collusion on the part of publishers. There are very little supply-chain costs related to the e-book version, and those cost savings should be reflected in the retail price of the e-book version, which is effectively set by the publisher via their wholesale price to places like Amazon. Competition should prevent this from happening, but because there are only a few major publishers, they are able to control prices in this manner. I will not support publishers who do this, and instead buy a used copy of the physical book so that they will benefit only minimally from their anti-competitive way of doing business."
4,The Rosedale Diet,"We are currently on the diet and it seems to be working. However, the book has some conflicting data in it...as far as what you can eat each week. It does have meal plans and menus which are helpful...not all the recipes are usuable (they aren't that good)."
5,The Rosedale Diet,"Dr. Rosedale really did his research! This is one of the best books I've read on nutrition, how our body works, and what we need to stay healthy and slim. Very informative, interesting and enlightening."
1,Helen fails to REFRESH an old topic,"This book does not serve its purpose as a definitive reference. I was able to read it cover to cover in an hour or so while sitting in an airport and found nothing remarkable - the striking part is that the book dismisses objects, methods and properties which the author does not understand or have experience with. REFRESH, for example (which is treated dismissively in the book) must be used in order to refresh a changed collection in a multi-user environment or update a collection in a rapidly changing single-user environment, or the field that you expected to be gone will still appear; or the table that you just built using DAO won't be in the collection.I was disappointed that Oreilly allowed such a book to be published. I had concerns about the author's technical ability before the book was published. Oreilly should have had these same reservations."
4,More Reference than How-to Book,"This book covered the most I've seen on DAO. It does not cover ADO at all, but mentions that another book covering ADO is in the works. The book is really a reference book, listing out each and every command. It works best as a lookup for specific commands. If you need to learn DAO get another book, but once your into it and get into trouble, this book might just help."
5,An excellent resource and reference book,"To say that this book is useful is an understatement. It combines in one compact volume a complete and understandable reference to DAO which now never leaves my side (even a bedside read!). Most of the references are punctuated with code samples written in such a neat way that it makes my own coding look cumbersome and tortuous. The book is worth buying for the code examples alone. Helen's book is enabling me to write succinct, direct code and to expand my knowledge and use of the DAO object"
3,Limited Resources,"When looking for books on this topic, I was struck by how little was out there. I bought this by default. He does a good job of explaining the issues surrounding mobile databases and some of the solutions. It was adequate for my paper. I have 3 stars because the illustrations are one line drawings and the book was written 6 years ago which is a long time in the computer age."
3,kind of boring pictures,"I got this book for our family for Christmas. The pictures that pop out are usually the same as the picture that made it,if that makes sense. There is a picture made up of shamrocks...the picture inside is a shamrock. There is no surprise in the picture, which to me isn't as fun. I dodn't appreciate the topless mermaid picture on the title page and last page of the book, I don't think that perticular picture is kid friendly. Otherwise the book is what I expected."
4,Soberias reflexiones sobre la psicología de la mujer,Divagaciones en torno al retrato del Marqués de Santillana
1,Odd and forced,"My kindergartner came home with this book from the library, we often will buy a book if we love it after reading it. We are a family of book lovers, and this one just totally misses all marks. I GUESS if you have a really large fondness for cows and anything cow-themed you might find it cute, but for the average person it wasn't very holiday-ish, it seemed like a really forced effort to parody a classic Christmas tale and was just weird rather than creative. The story isn't smooth, and it just sort of ends. Check it out at a library if you are interested but save your money and buy something else."
2,ON THE DOWNHILL SIDE...,"AFTER VIEWING THIS DVD, I'VE COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE REO OF YEARS GONE BY WAS MUCH BETTER. THESE GUYS LOOK OLD AND HAGGARD. SOMETIMES TRYING TO RECREATE THE PASSIONS OF YEARS GONE BY DOESN'T WORK. THE MUSIC JUST DOESN'T HAVE THE SAME PUNCH AS EVEN A FEW YEARS AGO. THE SHOW SEEMED CONTRIVED AND OVER REHEARSED.IF YOU WANT A GOOD SHOW, BUY THE ARCH ALLIESDVD WITH STYX AND REO. EACH DO A SET AND THEN PLAY TOGETHER AT THE END....SORRY GUYS BUT MAKEUP AND LOUD CHOPS DON'T REPLACE THE REAL DEAL....."
1,REO SPEEDWAGON,"This video doesn't even work, when you go to play it, there is no sound! I will be returning it and reconsidering using amazon for my purchases anymore. This isn't the first time I have had a problem with a product I have puchased."
4,time is an enemy,"its a good concert but time catches up to everyone. if your looking for that old feeling of reo its not there. but if you like the band, this will be good watching of an old rock n roll band still trying to get it out there. its a good show but for me just a bit of a disappointment. love thier music but sometimes you just have to say time is up. good show worth the price."
1,Very light weight,I found this very disappointing. Although the hits are there the execution is very weak. Obviously done on a budget and a very small one. Don't waste your money. Buy Foreigner instead
3,reo,"Oh the passage of time. If only this recording had been done 20 years ago or so when Kevin's voice was much younger. Don't get me wrong here, I would still pay to hear Kevin sing. You must remember that much of Reo's music is powerfull, melodic, vocal, Rock and Roll music. At his best, Kevin WAS the best. This particular concert has excellent sound, crisp and hi-fidelity. Picture quality is flawless. The production is unsurpassed, this by the way is what helps Cronin out immensely. The vocals are definitely dubbed, the band is really singing live but on top of pre-recorded music and vocal tracks. The end result....very good. REO still Rocks, highly skilled musicians at their best. Great rendition of Golden Country definitely a highlight. I recommend it."
3,Good but not great,"For me... this one was a 3-4 star product.Cannot be 5 stars without Richrath and ""Live Every Moment"".Amato is very good, but he isn't Richrath.I know they are still trying to record new music and sell new albums... thus their inclusion on the DVD. But that ship sailed LONG ago. There were at least 2 filler songs here that should have been cut and replaced with something older.On the upside.. Cronin's energy was great. Doesn't seem like he has lost much if anything. His crowd interaction was good. Camera work was fine.Playlist was solid except as noted. The last 3 songs were fantastic. I thought Roll with the Changes was hilight of the concert. I do miss the longer verbal lead-in to Ridin the Storm Out."
4,"The ""Other"" Great band from Chicago",Saw them live many many years ago. They still sound and sing GREAT. the Video and Audio (5.1 SS) is Fantastic.
3,All the pretty colo---skips---rs,"I bought them because they look cool especially the black CDR, but this CDR is one of the below average CDRs I've tried. I burn Mp3 songs and play them on my discman. When I go outside for a walk, my music cd tends to skip alot. After finishing the whole box, I switched back TDK or Sony."
1,S L O W compaged to my other flash drives,"I picked up an OCZ Rally2 Flash Drive because it was on sale at a local store (Micro Center). I am in the process of loading my backup folder (containing numerous sub folders each with numerous MS Word documents with large amounts of graphics).I loaded the same folder to a new Patriot XT Boost and the OCZ Rally2 at the same time. The Patriot XT Boost was done in less than a minute and about 20 minutes later the OCZ Rally2 is indicating 11 minutes remaining.I have consistently had better results in terms of speed and reliability with my Patriot flash drives, but the OCZ Rally2 was so much slower, that I felt I needed to warn others."
4,Cheap & Fast,"I have only had the drive for a day, so I cannot comment on longevity. The drive is faster than anything else in it's price class. The light is a little bright, but not distracting. When transferring the light flashes like a strobe light. I took one egg off since I do not know about durability or longevity.My tests were made with an Athlon 3000+, 1GB RAM, ECS KV2 Lite, Via 8237 Southbridge (USB Controller), and Antivirus disabled.Read Files & Folders (1.06 GB)OCZ 4GB Rally2: 27.35MB/s2GB Generic Sandisk: 18.23MB/sWrite Files & Folders (1.06GB)OCZ 4GB Rally2: 8.42MB/s2GB Generic Sandisk: 6.51MB/sWrite File (.99 GB)OCZ 4GB Rally2: 9.94MB/s2GB Generic Sandisk: 7.01MB/s"
3,Not as Good as My Kingston Data Traveler,"I bought this based on reviews touting its speed. I expected it to be faster than my Kingston Data Traveler- Well, i am disappointed. I did several timings and it is actually slightly slower than the Kingston Data Traveler. It also has no place to store the cap when you take it off; no doubt it will be lost soon. On the plus side the cap is tight fitting so that certainly no dust can get in and probably no water."
2,Photo fun but filled with factual errors,"This is not the first of Mr, Reuter's books I have purchased. They are invariably a lot of fun to look at but he needs to check and perhaps cross check factual sources. I always discover some errors and although these books may not be on a par with ""History of Western Civilization"" they are none the less a source of information for readers and should be factual in every sense. Otherwise I love his books, they take you back to some wonderful memories."
2,I'd like to see more sexy bodies,"I was deeply disappointed when I received the book, since I was expecting to find more beautiful bodies of Hollywood-actors. However, almost of all photographs in the book are neither sensual nor aesthetic. Yes, I admit that a few of them are well-built and muscular , but the editor could have collected better photographs if he really wanted to do so. And I wonder why most of actors had such poor-looking bodies, and why they didn't exercise themselves in weight training, swimming, etc."
2,Disappointing,"I was pretty disappointed with this book. I found the pictures to be lackluster and nothing special. Clearly the author has a ""thing"" for young twinkie types. If you feel the same way you might like this book. The guys who do it for me - the hairy daddy types like Sean Connery, Sam Elliott and Tom Selleck - are given the short end of the stick here, as it were.I also found the commentary to be a bit snide and leering. As I don't consider myself a prude at all, I don't quite know why I feel this way. But occasionally I wanted to tell the author to get over it!"
3,Nice but fragile,"This is a great looking ""bobble head"". Ceramic, very detailed and just plain fun. The outer box is pretty nice also as it has the album cover picture and pictures of the headknocker all around. The inner packaging seemed to be sturdy as well with a hard styrofoam box surrounding the piece. Unfortunately the arms were broken off when I opened the box. I could not even find the little Eddie that should be suspended under the devil. Now I have to decide if this is worth shipping back to England or just gluing on the arms and forgetting about the little Eddie."
1,Product received damaged :(,"The product shipped quickly and was exactly as shown, however, both arms and hands were broke off! My husband was very disappointed!"
3,Good Audio - Not great design,"As far as the audio quality is concerned, I'm well satisfied with this headset. I use it almost continuously when I'm working in my office. The head band, however, is not very well made. It uses a friction mechanism that does not hold it in position so unless you can use it fully extended it may not work well for you."
4,new headset,"This is a really great item, priced good and in good working order. Arrived in tip top shape and in a timely manner. I LOVE IT !"
4,Uniden headset for cordless phone,Great product. I have problems with my elbows being bent to hold a phone up for more than a few minutes so I started using a headset quite a few years ago. The only complaint I have about this headset is there is no volume control on the headset itself but other than that its a great headset.
1,Garbage. Connector designed to break at tip,"This is the worst headset I have ever owned. I bought so many of them over the years I don't remember anymore how many went bad. At least 10. The reason I keep buying them is because all other manufacturer headsets don't work well with a Uniden cordless phone. Uniden requires a specific impedance, otherwise voice quality is not good.Calling Uniden is worthless. They are of no help.I actually think they design the tip of the connector to break because each one has stopped working properly where the wire connects to the 2.5mm plug.I'm not buying anymore Uniden phones or headsets."
4,Great to be hands free,Headset is comfortable and works well. I can still get things done around the house while talking on the phone and this is a great help. Only drawback is that microphone is mounted on plastic mouth piece and this limits adjustability for the distance from mouth to microphone.
1,Get the AT&T 90800 Mini Headset,"The Uniden HS-910 Headset is poorly made, the headset that I recommended in my prior review is the AT&T 90800 Mini Headset, Amazon.com sells them, costs less, too."
2,Don't make my mistake,"I decided I wanted a headset so that I could talk on the phone while doing work or cooking around my house. I looked at both this Uniden headset and the AT&T one that is also sold on Amazon. Even though I read the reviews on here that said this headset can easily break I went ahead and bought one for cheap off the Amazon.com Outlet. I used it for a few months and was pretty happy with it. It was comfortable on my head, easy to adjust, sounded good, and I never got any complaints from people I was talking to.Then it broke.So now I'm about to shell out some more money for the AT&T headset and I figured I'd share my new found wisdom with everyone else."
1,Lucent Tech Headset,"I have seen the headphone that is described here, what a bulky, flimsy, poorly adjustable thing.The one that I received with my Lucent Tech 900 Mhz Analog Model 9107 works great on the Uniden 900 Mhz DSS Model 9960 that I have. It is an interesting design, a loop that clips the earpiece over the top of your ear, not around your head, with an adjustable microphone angle. Hard to describe, but very, comfortable. Do not know if they are sold separately, but highly recommended."
5,very satisfied customer,Great style. Great comfort. Great sound. So convenient and makes my multi-tasking even more easy and fun. I get a lot down these days and I can talk at the same time. No juggling! Whoooa!
1,Uniden HS910 Headset for Cordless Phones,Uniden HS910 Headset for Cordless PhonesI have used this product for less than a month and it has quit functioning on me. I can hear the speaker but the speaker is unable to hear me. How do I exchange this product and get another one. The previous one lasted about a year.Thank you for your assistance in this matter.MSG DAVID W. EZZELLUS ARMY SOCKOR KOREA352-436-4112
3,Uniden HS910 Headset for Cordless Phones,"Excellent product while it lasts. I have yet to have one of these last for more than four months. I usually purchase a few at time so that I always have a spare for when ever it no longer works. Because the telephone is so uncomfortable to hold, a handset is a necessity and this is the best one to have. Unfortunately, it does not last for too long."
1,No sale,"I used it once and my sister long distance couldn't even tell. I have used Plantronics plastic tube-type microphones at work and the sound quality was better the sister said.It was weird to have a very lightweight headset on my head -- instead of a phone clenched between my head and shoulder. But! I knew it was something I could learn to love quickly.The mike was not quite long enough however... call me a big mouth! It didn't reach around in front of my face. It was very much to the side. Just in the peripheral vision... again something I was sure I could get accustomed to.But. The next time I plugged it in, if I touched the cord or the phone or moved there was massive crackling. I gave up after a few more tries. I should of sent it back (Amazon is SUPER about replacing items) but didn't really think about it until the warranty had expired.I am ready to try again. But this time will read all the reviews before purchasing."
2,Great sound quality - poor durability,"This headset is my second. The first was from VTech - it cost more (back when I got it) and buzzed and was overall very useless. This one was great - clear, no buzz, no echo. But then a wire inside must have broken because the microphone no longer worked. And this was within the first 6 months. :-("
3,Uniden Headset - Good for Big Heads,"Have used for two weeks and headset works well. Head band is too long if you have a small/normal sized head, expands to a very large head size, but not possible to make it smaller. Not comfortable to wear on the head for long periods of time (several hours). I leave the headset around my neck between calls, and that is perfectly comfortable for 2-3 hours of phone calls per day. Volume good, no complaints on my voice quality from callers on other end. Boom mic has good range of motion, can swing easily out of the way while on long holds. TIP: keep mic directly in front of mouth (not off to side) for best results."
5,WATCH OUT,The gang's bangers have been sent back to their native country. Where many are usually arrested once they get off the plane. Now is this not a prescription for disaster! A Young man without a country! Welcome home says Al Qaeda........ New Recruits who already know the back way into the USA. READ THE STORY AND DO YOUR PART TO STOP TERRORIST.
5,Benjamin Kritzer,"To read Benjamin Kritzer is to make a new friend, both with the loveable title character as well as with the author who shares so warmly with us the endearing tales of his childhood (loosely disguised as fiction).How fun to read of first loves, classic movies and quirky families told from the odd and imaginative point of view of a nine-year old Benjamin. Rooted in the always intriguing backdrop of 1950's Los Angeles, His tales brought me back to the simpler time I've often heard about and helped me to look at La La land with a new reverence for it's history and for that of all the people, BK especially, whose personal histories are rooted in this town...and it's movie theatres, of course."
2,too many old chestnuts,"This book only has a handfull of good puzzles. Not surprisingly the best are about cars, that's what I expected from this book.What I don't like are the ""filler"" problems in the classic logic&math genre; seen too many of those around in countless puzzle books. The hokey photos and silly puns just don't make up for the lack of originality of the puzzles -sorry fellas.I hope the next book of cartalk puzzles will have more original puzzles."
4,A Visual Treat,"The illustrations are the strongest element in this book. The language used to tell the story does not flow or inspire. In fact, the text seems a bit clunky and difficult to read aloud smoothly. Buy it for the illustrations, then improvise the telling of the story to your child."
4,Stunning!,"A cat thinking he is the center of his owner's whole world? Do not all cats, and possibly dogs as well, think that? Well things change once Marshmallow comes into play.Studying the art and poetry in the book is stunning. It is a fun little tale of a family growing whether they want each other at first or not. Very sweet, to read for Easter holiday, spring or any day!"
5,Marshmallow,"I have been looking for this book since my children were in elementary school, but it has been out of print. It is a perfect elementary ""picture book"", that makes you and the child cuddle and read it over and over."
5,great for baby gifts,"Hi,this book is great for baby showers, and its an amazing gift.great for kids and enjoyable for adults."
5,Good book,"Good book, not for a beginning reader though. I would put it at about a 3rd grade level give or take. Good story to read to your kids if they aren't old enough to read it on their own, very sweet."
5,Great Gift idea,Ended up buying 2! Would recommend to anyone looking for a gift or just a lovely apron to hang in your kitchen.
3,"Intermediate, not Advanced","I would give this 4-5 stars as a begining to intermediate book, which it is. This is a small book, perhaps pricey for its size. I would get this book after you do Pimsleur and a Living Language beginner to intermediate CD package."
4,I love it!,We use this phone outside by our hottub and pool. Takes the worry out of dropping it accidentally.
5,"Perfectly functional, great sound and range",Great phone. I bought it of course because it's waterproof and was happily surprised by both the clarity and range. Good value so I bought a second one as well. The buttons are intuitive and the screen is sharp.
1,Great phone - just do not get it wet,"After five minutes of use, while wading in the pool, the phone failed due to an apparent leak. Ironically, the directions tell you what to do if water leaks into the unit. Would not recommend permitting the phone to be submersed."
2,Oops! Didn't survive the rain here!,"We accidently left it outside overnight, and it rained. Has never worked since! I took it apart and dried it out. Left it off the charger until it was decharged. Put it back on the charger and it charged, but still won't work. Not so ""water proof"" for us."
2,This phone sounds like you're in a tunnel.,"When you are talking on this phone, the person to whom you are talking sounds like they are in a tunnel. It works the same on the other end. i.e., on a speaker phone. Also the phone is very unattractive. I haven't had it long enough to rate the battery life."
5,Uniden water proof wireless phone,"I have been waiting a long time to find this phone at the right price. Finally found this one through Amazon. It is refurbished, but looks and feels brand new! The features are exactly the same as my regular wireless uniden phones. I was able to add this phone to my existing set of phones that include the TRU9480 base. This phone is compatible with a whole bunch of different 5.8 bases, so go to the uniden website to make sure you can use this phone on your base. It does come with it's own base however, but then you need to have a phone jack near by. In my case, there is no phone jack outside, so this is a perfect fit. One more thing, the seller has a website where you can download the users manual, but I was not able to find it for this particular model which is a WXI477. I did find the TWX977, which is identical and I used those instructions to register this phone to my existing base."
2,extremely short battery life,"Within the last month I purchased a new cordless phone, model WX1477. It has never gotten wet. It has never even been close to being wet. I find the length of the battery life to be extremely poor (less than 3 days). My previous cordless, a Panasonic, could go for two (2) weeks without having to worry about returning it to its charging cradle. All the other features of this phone are great. It looks gorgeous. The speakerphone is louder than my Panasonic was. But keeping this Uniden in the charge cradle is a real drag. A less-than-average cordless."
3,Forgot to send parts,"The phone itself is great! I had to purchase the plugin and a battery. I got the phone and was still unable to use it for a week, due to I had to wait to receive the parts they forgot to send. I had to purchase them from elsewhere and was very displeased with the seller of this product."
3,Angel unchained/Cycle Savages,"This movie was viewed by me as being a fashion statement from the era inwhich it was produced. Having been a biker as far back as 1967, I can reflect on the dress code for the movie as well as the motorcycles used as being accurate. I enjoy watching this movie DVD."
3,It's good but not very.,"I saw this book in Beijing and I bought it because it's Disney's.But when I went back to the hotel and read it, I felt that it is not very good, especislly the story ""Oliver&Company;"".The pictures are not very good, but the stories are acceptable."
2,"2 stars, only because it's Disney","The only thing that sells this book is the fact that it's based on Disney charachters we know and love. The stories in the book are so shallow! My four year old likes the pictures, my ten year old wants to know why the only ""christmas"" thing mentiond in the book is presents! Not worth the money!"
5,My favorite movie of all time,"No need to write a review about the movie here, but this poster is a great work of art that depicts the movie in a rather funky way. I like it, and I have it framed next to my computer desk in my room. It makes me smile every time I look at it.“I’m videotapin’ this for scientific research. This bleep will be on the Discovery Channel.”Haha."
1,Disappointed product,The shipping was fast and the customer service was excellent. I was just very disappointed in the product itself. The product claims to give energy and reduce appetite yet after drinking the tea I never experienced a decrease in appetite or any energy. Wouldn't buy it again.
3,so-so,Tastes ok. A couple of cups gives a slight buzz. Doesn't really kill my appetite like I was anticipating.
2,disappointed,"I recieved the toy a week before Christmas and the batteries needed to be replaced. As I went shopping for the new batteries that the box suggested, I had a very hard time finding a store to compare numbers/letters. When we finally figured out what should work-I got home and they in fact did not fit the toy. The batteries cost $18 total and in my opinion, the toy should have never been shipped needing new batteries. At this time Mechanikat still sits quiet."
2,Not the HBO version.,"I thought that this was the same as the episodes we've watched on HBO, but it is a different narrator. Some people prefer this one; unfortunately, my 4-year-old is not one of them!"
2,Boring,"this one is narrated by I think, the author, who has a monotone, boring voice, and the stories are sleep-inducing too. And she loves Harold. But refuses to watch this video. But the condition of it was great, smooth transaction, good seller."
3,Review of the Movie,"This 1932 movie is about a brilliant lawyer, who is well-liked by his community, who is only somewhat successful financially, but very successful in wining cases. He wins a big case and is offered a partnership in a prestigious firm. He is also offered a job by the political boss of the area, which he turns down. He is a ladies-man who doesn't realize that his secretary loves him and is very jealous of the women he dates. All goes well until people get him implicated in a crime. Why are the people trying to frame him? Will they succeed in destroying his reputation? Will he be able to stay on top? Does he want to remain on top? Or does he prefer to return to his old life? Will he realize that he can be happy with having his secretary as his wife?"
3,Interesting but disappointing.,"I am a fan of NIN ever since Head Like A Hole.I was interested in some of the songs like Closer, Heresy, and Into the Void................but they forgot the major songs like ""Hurt"", ""We're In This Together"", ""Where Is Everybody?"", ""Star****ers INC."", and ""I'm Afraid Of Americans"" (I know David Bowie did it, but Trent did the song alongside him). I beg Vitamin to give a favorite composer of mine a chance to do justice. I've listened to his stuff and I think he can justify the wrongs that were done on this CD."
2,Way too cheery and staccato,"This album captures none of the mystery and darkness of Nine Inch Nails' music. I love classical music. I love string quartet music. I love Nine Inch Nails. String quartet music can be dark and mysterious--listen to some of the stuff the Kronos Quartet has recorded. The interpretations on this album are extremely literal, and that's not a compliment. The players shouldn't be attmepting to make their instruments into electric guitars, they should be interpreting the music using the excellent qualities of their own instruments. Most unimpressive. The string quartet people have put together tribute albums for a number of other artists I like, but I won't be checking them out due to the low quality of this album."
3,"Worth checking out, maybe","I didn't think it was all that bad, then again, perhaps it could have been better. The adaptations were okay for the most part, yet hearing the violin sort of made some of it, (especially on Closer, sounds more like a fiddle) feel like square dance music or something. Quite funny! I guess it would be difficult to try to make the songs sound as intense as the originals and perhaps fans do expect too much. Strings really does bring a different sort of moodiness to the music, sort of a more chaotic feeling. I'm not so sure how to rate this! 3.5 stars, I guess. It is different and it is a tribute to NIN which does make it worth while. I would listen to it again just for the novelty of it."
2,More reliable sources are available,"Kent Hovind is not a scientist, biologist, or archeologist. He was a Christian school teacher who begain collecting and compiling information and theories about creationism and evolution into a series of lectures and sermons. Some of what he has to say is good, while some is rejected by even creationists. Dr. Hovind is also a believer in conspirarcy theories about the UN, the US Government, and 9-11, and is a tax resister (which led to his conviction on tax evasion charges). While this has little to do with his work on creationism, it does call into question his credibility.If you want to research or study creationism, I recommend that you pass on Dr. Hovind's work and check out material by organizations like Answers In Genesis and Creation Ministries International. They employ real scientists and are much more reliable sources of creationist material."
5,Firm and fits perfectly,"We are expecting our first child in a few weeks and needed a mattress to go in the new crib. After reading reviews and recommendations we decided to try this one out. When I laid on the mattress it was firm, not crinkly, and comfortable. It also fit the crib perfectly. Hopefully our little guy will enjoy it!"
2,"Doesn't hold up to ""the toddler""","I love Colgate. Both of my sons have had a Colgate mattress (the Visco-Classica 2-in-1). This mattress was a replacement for the one he had used since birth (we purchased it just prior to him turning 4). Now 9 months down the road all the ""stuffing"" is coming out of the mattress. For a couple of months I have had to use packing tape to keep it all in. My son likes to jump on his bed occasionally, and this mattress just couldn't stand up to it. If you have a tame child who will use the mattress just to sleep, then you should be fine. However, if you have an active little child like mine, you'll do better with a mattress with a damask cover that won't rip and get caught in the springs of the bed when he (or she) jumps on it."
4,Not As Bad As The Reviews Would Indicate,"A bank robber, Basinger, wants to go straight but she is forced to do another big bank job because her son is kidnapped by a bank-robbing kingpin. The story has many twists and turns. Although it is a bit far-fetched, the story is entertaining."
2,"Lamebrained, suspenseless thriller wannabe","Kim Basinger, who has been sprung out of prison after six years, realizes she has to go on one last heist to save her son from kidnappers. What could have been a competent, exciting actioner (with such such a good cast and occassionally interesting intentions) is just a substandard mystery-drama that most people won't like."
5,very good,"Kim Basinger is a very good actress and she proves her worth in this film, This movie is well worth the purchase."
4,real mccoy,"awesome movie nice packaging this is a service i want it, pretty neat perfectly factory seal i like it. great job!!"
2,Nice trademark Mulcahy visuals but substance is lacking...,"This 1993 film by legendary Australian film director Russell Mulcahy is unfortunately like much of his later work: A missed opportunity.As usual with Mulcahy's work it is the visuals here that really keep you watching along with imaginative staging and great editing.The script isn't all that bad either the basic plot is as follows:A woman is released from prison, an expert bank robber who wants to settle down and go straight, but her parole officer and her former employer try to get her to pull one more heist.The main problem I think the film has is the unimaginative performace given by leading actress Kim Basinger. She is not as sexy in this film as she can be, she is not as interesting as she can be and in fact she looks bored.Val Kilmer offers a little bit of comedic relief but eventually grows tiresome as the film enters it's final act.I'd give this film two out of five."
5,I have never thought of some of these issues before,This book was required in one of my classes. It brought up issues related to those tied to a University and those for Ethnographers that are independent. It was worth the read for the background information alone.
5,THE REINACTMENT OF THE WAR,THIS BOOK IS AN EXCELLENT ACCOUNTING OF THE PEOPLE AND EVENTS THAT REALLY MAKE THE JOHNSON COUNTY WARS. IT WAS COMPLETELY ABSORBING.
1,Worthless,"I bought this wireless adapter for my newly constructed computer over a year ago. I have painfully dealt with the poor signal, constant drops (sometimes 4 times a day). I am happy to say today I'm ordering a new adapter. I'm done with this company forever. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. This thing won't even make a decent paper weight."
2,Computer Freeze,"While installation was a breeze, I stuggled to get it setup due to WEP security. The biggest disappointment was that although once connected it had blazing speed but hungup the computer. It would freeze and require a hard reboot. I attempted to work thorough email support due to long wait times on calls. That was no help, ended up returning the card."
2,Netgear Wireless Card non Compatibility W7 or at least with Emachine PCI slot,"I purchased this wireless card, because I decided that I didn't want to deal with a USB and heat issues on my PC.I installed the 1st card without success. Amazon exchnaged it for a 2nd card and I suffered the same results. Windows 7 gave me a generic wireless card driver which the Netgear card and Emachine never successfully installed the card. I couldn't analyze wheere the source of the problem is, but it wasn't the wireless card itself, but somewhere in the inoperbility. Netgear or Emachine Support couldn't straiten it out. I returned the 2nd card to Amazon and didn't receive my full money back.I ended up going to a Netgear USB as my wireless solution."
1,Dont event try it -,"This device is huge.The maxrange is just a jokeit does install properly on windows 7 x64 Sp1no problem installing it. windows picks it up and installs it easily.the max range is garbage.i too got better connection from a cheap usb dongle than this huge, huge! device.Go dlink.i will be returning this back to best buy.dont buy it!"
1,Netgear WN311B,This produst was installed and worked good for about two weeks then it died. It was however easy to get RMA to return.
1,Worst card for Windows 7 64-bit,"Have had nothing but trouble since purchasing this card a while ago. PC will freeze randomly, lots of clicking & popping coming out of my speakers, and the card will just randomly stop talking to my home router.Even the updated Broadcom driver through Windows update bricks the card until you roll it back to a previous driver.Disabled the card and viola, problems went away. Won't ever be buying a Netgear product again."
1,Warning Stay Away! Garbage,This piece of junk has cost me HOURS of stress.Troubleshooting this device from hell...It's ugly too and doesn't match my black and red theme.I got it after I moved for temporary wireless until I can wire this house with Cat6.I probably will never buy any Netgear crap again.The Linksys router and Motorola modem were getting blamed by me for the issue of a dropping connection every minute or so.Not to mention the ISP.Sorry guys!It wouldn't have been my first choice but I only had Best Buy to go to.Fry's is a bit far away from me now.I should have gone to Frys and gotten a decent card!Would have saved me so much trouble.At least now I know.Netgear seriously wants people to unplug the computer take the card in and out and go through all this drama to install drivers?!No fricken way!Yes I did that but it didn't work but why should I?Nothing else I've dealt with requires that level of nonsense and then continuously fails.This product has no redeeming qualities.Stay away!
3,"Easy install, but proprietary software malfunctions with Vista","Detailed:Another decent offering from Netgear. I bought this as an upgrade to my mother's computer. She is digitally illiterate, so ease of operation was a critical factor in selecting this hardware. It's being used in a machine with Windows Vista. The propriatary wireless connection management software clashed with the Vista wireless management software, causing poor connection quality due to frequently dropped signal and a need to perpetually re-connect manually. After re-installing the Netgear software and reconfiguring twice, I just uninstalled and used the integrated Vista software to management the connection, and there have been no problems since.Summary:If you're using Windows Vista, it's easy to install and use, but only if you don't use the Netgear software to management the wireless connection."
3,WPN 311 & Windows 7,"I brought this adapter after reading the specs on NetGear's web site. The site indicated that this adapter was Windows 7 ready. It took a lot of machinations to get Windows to finally recognize the adapter. When it did it mistakingly identified it as a Broadcom wireless adapter. This was after swapping the adapter for a new one, changing slots on motherboard and trying different drivers from NetGear's web site. Finally got the adapter to load under Linux and after returning from Windows 7 to Vista, Wwindows finally did recognize the adapter.I have seen no added advantage from the existing adapter I had installed which was a WPN111."
1,Garbage,"This is probably one of the worst things I have every gotten.I was trying to improve signal strength and it appear and the antenna would be helpful. The signal strength of this thing is pitiful. I had better signal with a cheap usb adapter than with this. Plus setup is difficult. When you get it set up there is no way to save your selection as to whether to have their software or windows manage the connection. Every time you do anything with your connection there is a pop up which asks you if you want Netgear or Windows to manage your connection. This thing is going back. By the way, I bought it through a brick and mortar store but I want to warn anyone on Amazon who was thinking of buying this. The name Rangemax is a joke."
2,Constant Signal Drops,"I just started working remotely from home and one of the IT guys at my company recommended it... I don't know why because it is junk. I've been working from home using this adapter for almost 3 weeks now and I finally got to the point to where I had to send my husband to best buy and get one that works. I'm supposed to be working right now, but the thing doesn't give me enough signal strength anymore to be able to connect. I connected just fine on the laptops, but I can't work all day that way because I have to have dual screens. I'm even having connection issues while writing this review. I can't think of a reason why this would be useful for anyone. It jumps anywhere from 5mbps to 39mbps in any given moment. It's just unstable. Get a dLink."
2,Save your money,"I've been dealing with this sort of equipment on PCs for many years. This unit is about the worst thing I've encountered. From its convoluted install proceedure to the constant droping of the connection to a well thought of router - one which our two laptops have no problem with, this device is a real pain and is going in the trash!I don't know if the issue is with the hardware or the driver (yep I've upgraded), but if a unit can't work on a brand new computer running win7 32bit who needs it? I suspect netgear has a ship container full of this flop and is just waiting for the inventory to hit bottom."
5,Great product all around!,"Installation was worry-free. I made a mistake and installed the card into PCI slot (instead of installing drivers first), but it still installed drivers just fine. I'm using 64-bit Windows 7.With a movable antenna box it is very flexible and allows you to achieve best results. I placed antenna in front of my PC tower in the direction of the router and immediately got all 5 bars (occasionally dropping to 4).Speed test delivered exactly the same speed as when router was hard wired to my PC. During testing router was about 20 feet away separated by 1 wall. So far I haven't noticed any drops in connection. My router is NETGEAR N300.Make sure your motherboard has a PCI slot (many motherboards nowadays only have PCI-Express slots which will not be compatible with this product). This is probably the only downside of this adapter.Summary: great, versatile product delivering same speed as when PC is hard wired to router. PC must have an ""old"" PCI slot."
3,Whines alot,This toy was for my granddaughter and we sent it in the mail to her so I am not sure how to rate it. I did have it at my house for a couple of days before shipping it to her and I must say that it was quite annoying. Everytime you walked by this thing it would whine like a puppy. While being cute and cuddly it was also annoying.
1,ugly,"This toy is ugly and it has a HUGE head. All it does it make this awfuly annoying and nerve-grating whining noise.Hope I did some help,KP"
4,Teaches Children Empathy!!,"Even though the concept for this toy is simple, I believe you can truly use it as a teaching tool for young children. The Sad Eyes and the theme of ""Rescueing"" an animal along with the irresistable whine helps to teach children about Empathy and being kind to animals! You can help your child actually go online and adopt the pet, which is fun and also a learning experience! I also love that the company donate's a portion of the sale to Leash on Life, an animal Charity! Every time my daughters Rescue Pets whine I cant help but want to hug that thing, it really does pull at the ""heart Strings""!"
3,Cute but irritating,"This toy is cute and it's fur is soft but the whining can be irritating. It makes the same sound each time which is triggered by touch or motion near it's right eye. I set it off just by walking by it. I assume that the whining can be stopped by simply removing the batteries but the toy comes with the batteries already in them. I can't disable it unless I open the packaging. Since I purchased it as a gift, that's not an option. Just moving the package around triggers it. The concept is nice though."
5,Great 2Pac song!,"I like this song because it shows that rap isn't all the drugs, violence, and sex talk that everyone thinks it is. It packs a good message and I'm sure everybody will enjoy it. Check it out!"
5,2Pac is the biggest legend and Changes is his greatest work,Changes is a great song written by a great man. he talks freely about the value of human life and how the war of the middle east is the same as the war on the streets. Its an allround great song and if you like 2 Pac go out and buy his greatest hits or at least this single
5,2Pac is my alltime fave rapper and iI love ''Changes'',"2Pac is my alltime fave rapper and Changes is my favorite song in the whole wide world.I also like the songs called Life Goes On,California Love, How Do You Want it,and Unconditional Love. If you love 2Pac, i suggest you go buy 2pacs Greatest Hits right now because thats pretty much all i listen to!"
2,A disgrace to his name,"I'm sure Tupac was a great man and I mourn his death. He was one of the few great rappers and probably the only from the West Coast. This song, however, is booty. If you know his other works, it doesn't take long to realize that this song is just a bunch of passages from other songs grouped together and placed on a sorry piano riff. If your only looking to buy ""Greatest Hits"" for this song, look elsewhere. ""Changes"" does not represented the late, great Tupac Shakur."
4,More Please!,"Wow - what a great first! Joyce Yarrow does a fantastic job of keeping action and intrigue moving throughout the book. Her character, Jo Epstein, is a very real, likeable person with amazing depth. Throughout the book, Jo maintains a tough ""New York"" type exterior, and her investigative journey jumps through action packed twists and turns. Although she is determined and no-nonsense, she reveals herself to be deeply caring as well. Jo has an eccentric ability to gather clues and solve the case, and in this book, even with the help of listening to the dead. The book became more interesting and captivating the more I read, and I couldn't put it down until I was done. I'm looking forward to Ms. Yarrow's next book."
4,I remember Cinerama!,"This is Cinerama was the first effort to produce a truly wide-screen movie. Three projectors and three screens all sychronized together made the viewer feel lie he was really in the movie. The roller coaster ride was stunning, and the journey around the world made this a real movie first. Today we have digital movie screens (are there still movie projectors any more??), but for the time in which this movie was made, it was a great adventure."
4,Good old days of real wide screen movies,"This really brings back memories, the video quality is very good considering the age of the print..The audio was OK sounded a bit flat at times, but all in all a good product for the price."
2,historic novelty only,"ONCE WOULD HAVE DONE IT. I really wanted to see this historic film.It's horribly dated, and the vignettes are really quite boring.LAME.Only for the most passionate film enthusiasts."
4,No Subtitles,"I am very glad with this Blu Ray and the quality is very good, however I have one complaint and that is it has NO Subtitles. Therefore I didn't give 5 stars. I hope the companies read this, I already have mentioned this a million times but until now it doesn't help."
4,..and more reviews:,"Here's a new site online that opened two weeks ago with more reviews, photos, and Cinerama history: thiswascinerama.com. Enjoy! Comments and discussion welcomed."
5,This is Cinerama DVD,For those who enjoyed Cinerama when it was released in the Cinemas this DVD will bring back memories and has beenre mastered in Smile Box format to give it a realistic effect how ever this format does not have the same effect on TV's under 24inches and tends to blur. If you have a home cinema great effect Looking forward to future Cinerama releases
3,"Great quality, thin story","I didn't see this one as a youngster (had to travel 250 kilometres to see Cinerama). Story is very thin. Had a laugh at the dressed up water ski ladies at Cypress Gardens.....not very same as the real circumstances (I have been there...). Again, thanks for the great restoration work. I do want to see the next one on blu ray, ""Seven new wonders of the world (or something like that...)."
5,The best movie format ever!!!,"I was born in the 1950's, but I never got to see a Cinerama movie. But now I have a home theater HD system with 7.1 surround. I just got the movie, ""This Is Cinerama"" in the smilebox version on BluRay. I was so impressed with the video and DTS HD Master Audio soundtrack in 7.1 surround. The Smilebox really gives the illusion of the wrap-around screen effect with real depth and perception. And the 7 channel sound puts the voices exactly where they are seen on the screen. I have watched it twice in the same week I got it in the mail.I also got the Cinerama movies ""Windjammer"" and ""How The West Was Won"". They are all equally impressive in the Smilebox format. I was so impressed, I did an atricle in tribute to Cinerama on my own website at k3dav.comThis is a must see movie, and a deep wish on my part to bring this wonderful format back to life with new and old movies. Call or write the movies studios in Hollywood and ask them to do movies in the Cinerama format."
2,cut in half,When I received the package I found that each tube is cut in half. Now I have to have them welded together. This will cost hours of time plus paying for a welder. They could have roll-folded them instead of cutting. So much for saving money by ordering online.
3,I have not found this to be very useful for my needs,"I own two Cobra CPI 480 power inverters and was hoping to use this as a sort of extension cord for the short lighter (power port) Cobra provides. Unfortunately the Cobra inverter doesn't like this extension cord. It chirps and doesn't provide AC power when this cord is used.Overall it seems well enough made, and if it worked with my Cobra power inverter it'd be great.Some smaller stuff works with it (phone power charger), but sadly not the device I need. My review is 3 stars as I'm neutral about it. For my needs this wasn't a good choice, for someone who needs to extend a phone charger it may be an ideal solution."
4,Good cheap 12v extension cable,Cable works great for to go from dash to back seat for child's TV in a mid-sized car. Only con is that the cable does not unstreach and retain its shape.
4,Not A BAd Deal For the Price,This product is not bad. BAttery lasts long enough for a 2 hour conversation. Sound is not bad and The telephone has good features!
2,I went back to the cheaper disposable ones,"I tried to like this, but I found I had to constantly clean it. The filter would become brown or green and the flow would slow within just a few days at some sites in Canada, within a week or two at many other places. It was a pain to scrub the cartridge over and over. It didn't keep the water clear at one location in Alaska that had brown water, I thought it would do a better job. My filter cartridge developed a hole in it after about a month, not a crack, a hole that looked like it thinned from the inside out - like a manufacturing defect. All in all, the Taste Pure ones work better for me."
4,Excellent vest for daily wear,"I have been wearing this style of Rothco vests for many years now.In very strenuous day to day wear, they last approximately 6-9 months before little things start to creep in (slight tears at seam convergance points, little tears in the pockets)I keep EVERYTHING in it, wallet, keys, change, watch, pda, pocketknife, few tools, sidearm, pocketwatch, business card holder, etc... so it's QUITE loaded all the time.One of the best vests I've ever found, and I continue to buy 2 every year."
5,Vest is Great for tall Trunked People,"I got this vest primarily to keep all of my tech gear handy when I to volunteer audio/video production work. I was looking for a vest that didnt ride up around my mid section as many of these type of vest do for me. The reason for this is that I have a very long trunk and shorter legs. As a result I end up shopping in the Big an Tall section even though I am only 5' 10"". I took a chance and it paid off.I will now probably be getting the same type of vest in a different color than black for when I am out with my family.great vest and it fits great. Rothco makes a concealed carry vest that is based on this same design that will soon find its way into my closet."
5,a good value,This vest has so many pockets that even I can't fill them all. I love it. It is a high quality product at a good price.
5,"Great, durable backpack",Unless your cat pees on it. Then it stinks. But I'm buying the same bag in a different color; I love it so much.
4,Pretty Good - Except for handle,The picture doesn't do this bag justice. The colors are way cooler than this picture. I really like this bag. I pack it with about 40 lbs of books with no problem. My only complaint is the rinky-dink handle on the top of the bag. There are times when I just want to carry my bag without putting it over my shoulder but the handle hurts my hand because it's so tiny and cheap.
5,Great Buy!!,I've priced this product at various other department and sporting good stores - Amazon came through again!!! Price/Quality is just was I had expected from Amazon LLC.I'll be back again and again...
5,Plenty-o-space!,"Had a hard time finding a decent backpack that would accomodate all my son's books and 'five-star"" binder. This one fits the bill. Plenty of space, great durability and four months later still looks great. All that you would expect from a JanSport product along with a great price! Son also prefers the messenger style bag now as it allows him to easily add or access things quickly when in a rush to the bus."
4,Interesting product,Bought this bag for work and its real nice. Made from good material and the bag is spacious. Has a suitable number of compartments. Its good for students to carry books and also good to carry a laptop around. Bag has a real nice design. Great buy
4,well made,"well made, large enough. gave four stars for difficulty to unlock for my daughter, otherwise happy with the purchase."
3,Nice... but...,It really is a tad too big for books. There is a lot of space for books to slide back and forth and I carried some full-sized textbooks around.
3,"Great capacity, Poor weight distribution","I can easily fit my laptop as well as several books in this bag, but if I carry more than one textbook along with my laptop, it is painful to carry the bag. Regardless if I position the bag across my body or on just one shoulder, it does not seem to distribute weight well or offer sufficient support. If you don't have a lot to carry I would recommend this bag. Easy to organize the supplies that I need to carry with me."
2,Weber 566002 Q 220 Gas Grill,The Weber 566002 Q 220 Gas Grill works great with throw away gas bottles. Beware that the grill has nothing bout problems when you hook it up to a 20lb gas tank. I have had nothing but problems and frusration with this grill. Until Weber comes up with a fix for this incompatibility issues with its regulator I would strongly advise against purchasing one.
5,Weber Q,"I have to say that this grill was everything it was advertised to be. I am not mechanically inclined, and I had it installed in less than 5 minutes. After that I was off and running. It heats up wonderfully and food cooks very evenly. Couldn't be happier with my purchase."
5,Excellent portable gas grill,"I will make my review short since so many before me have detailed all the attributes of this wonderfully portable gas grill.This is one fantastic grill considering its' purpose in life. We take this grill everywhere, kids ball games for tailgating, camping, plus we use it more now than we use our charcoal grill when grilling at home. You can cook alot of food on the grate and that is usually what's lacking in other portable grills...grilling capacity.But one thing to keep in mind when hauling the grill after you've used it...empty the grease catch pan before you put it in your vehicle! We learned this lesson the hard way and our Suburban smelled like brats for 2 weeks after the spill!!Absolutely the best portable gas grill on the market today."
3,Beware of Shipping Breakage!,"Before you order this grill online, read the comments, and notice how many people received broken grills. I just got this from Amazon, and of course I read AFTER I ordered about the shipping problems.Of course mine came today, and is broken. The packaging inside the box is horrible, not prepared at ALL for shipping. This is not Amazon's fauly, it's Webers. The plastic tables (which are fairly cheap already) definitely cannot take the stress of being rattled around, and break.The grill will hopefully be great, but I'll have to buy it locally, as it's pretty clear that it's a risk to buy this thing online. Wish it was packaged better."
5,Great Grill,"I have had this for a couple days now. Limit use but so far but I'm very pleased. Easy set up, great even cooking. I have had cheaper fullsize grills and this blows them away. As posted elswhere you need to heat it up for 10 min then back it down to cook. Also the 14.1 cylinders are at Home Depot at the Plumbing pipe section in the torch supplies and are cheap so get a couple. All in all with the cart and tank adapter, which I'm going to get this is a great home and travel grill."
2,Not Hot Enough!!,"On the plus side this grill is well constructed*, heats evenly and will undoubtedly last. Serious drawbacks should be considered before the purchase of this item. 1)* The fold out leafs are plastic, warp easily and offer little support. 2) The tank support provides only for a narrow disposable cylinder and needs to be removed for a wider one. 3) The grill simply does not provide enough heat to cook any thing rare to MR without having to move the item perpetually around the grill to get the grate to sear it. Forget about Tuna or any other high grade Fish Searing as well as a great rare to MR steak unless it's over two inches thick.I expect more from a no frills single burner grill costing $ 180- I can get the same poor results from a $50 grill. I will be seeking a refund."
5,"Pretty good grill, but it is the customer service that gets the 5 stars","I've had this grill for 3 or 4 years now. Nothing special. Better than any other small grill that I have owned. The big deal to me is the customer service. I called Weber stating that I wanted to buy a new burner and regulator but I couldn't find them anywhere. They asked for the serial number and my address. One week later, brandy new free parts. Sweet. Customer service rocks!"
4,Great Grill for RVers,"We are full time RVers and avid Food Channel enthusiasts. We were very concerned about performance, space, ease of setup and cleanup. This grill is not as small as some, and doesn't have the performance of others, but gives us a lot of bang for the buck (and cubic inch). It also cools down quickly after use. By the time you eat and clean up, it can be placed back into the cargo compartment. While I am not in love with the type of propane tank the grill uses, you can find them anywhere and they are cheap. We also purchased the grill cover and the stainless steel tool set. It would also be great for an apartment with a small patio. I would purchase it again."
3,"Good grill, beware of propane bottles","The weber Q is a great small grill, easy to set up and use. One note, it does not use the standard 16 oz propane bottles that are for sale everywhere. It uses a taller, thinner 14.1 oz bottle that is not as easy to find. I found the bottle at a local hardware, but many of the larger stores (i.e. Home Depot, Target, Wall-Mart, etc do not carry this 14.1 oz size"
5,Perfect for my pontoon boat.,This is my second Weber Q. Took my last one to Mexico with me last winter and used it so much I decided to leave it at my condo there and get another one for a pontoon boat. Grilled five steaks at once on it last week and they turned out great even with some wind conditions. I been cooking with weber grills for over thirty years and love them.
1,12000 BTUs is too few,"I had been grilling every week, winter and summer, for over fifteen years when I bought my Weber Q grill. Its burner is too small to heat sufficiently, especially when it is cold outside. At only 12,000 BTUs it cannot generate enough heat to get the cover even moderately warm and consequently, it does not grill well. It is too large to be truly portable, in the way of tent camping. And the side shelves are too weak to hold a plate of hamburgers without bending precariously."
2,"Overpriced, underpowered, faulty","Our Q200 arrived with a faulty ignition system. Since purchasing we saw a review of this item in the local paper, and their's also had a faulty ignition system. We reported the problem to Weber which quickly sent out -- a replacement, but sent the part for a different model. So we are still lighting by hand. The Weber does cook food well, but remember that unless you spring for the Q300 you get only one burner, and no warming plates -- fine if you are cooking a few burgers, but a problem if you are cooking multiple items. It means that you have to magically cook everything so that it is done simultaneously in order to keep all items warm. I can only assume that all the positive reviews come from people who have never cooked with gas before, and are thrilled at the easy and even cooking that this, and most gas BBQs provide. But anyone with experience with a larger home unit providing multiple burners will find the Q Series a frustrating experience."
2,180 bucks for that???,"Don't get me wrong, I'm sure the Weber Q grill is a quality grill that grills up food very nicely. But for $180 it's surprising the lack of features it has for a portable grill.For a portable grill, it's heavy. Does it have a built-in stand that collapses into a handle and wheels, so that you can wheel it around? How about interchangeable cooking surfaces, so you can do more than grill? How about 2 burners so you can cook at different temps?I'm sorry, I might pay $80 or so for a portable gas grill with this limited set of features. I think the other $100 is for the Weber name stamped on it.If you'd like to look at something a lot more versatile and feature rich, check out theColeman 9949-750 Road Trip Grill LXE (Red)."
1,No customer service,"if you ever have to call Weber customer service you are in trouble.They employ the nicest sounding, most polite people on the face of the earth but they are clueless.They are worse than the the strictest script reading overseas CSR's because they are convinced that you are stupid and the key to your intellectual salvation lies on the scripted response sheet they have in front of them.If you have mechanical or engineering experience that indicates what they are telling you might be wrong, well you are just a silly man!!"
1,Never Got To Use It?,"I purchased this item on Amazon. Received it and plastic of the grill leg was damaged. Amazon was great and sent a replacement, no questions asked. The replacement was all so damaged. Once again, without question Amazon offered a replacement or refund. I took the refund. Weber needs to pack better or find a company that ships better?"
4,7 Years and Counting with My Q,Had mine for 7 years or so with no issues. Works great! I recommend the stand and 20# propane bottle conversion hose. I use mine as my home grill and have cooked hundreds of meals on it! Gave it 4 stars because the table flaps could be sturdier.
4,Great little Grill,"We had this grill for 2 summers and just loved it. It was easy to use, clean, and move and was plenty big enough for us and our friends at barbecues. My only issue was that the fold out sides were a bit iffy for heavier plates of food ( like the plate loaded up with steaks) but we just ended up using another table. The main unit itself was great and cooked our food really well."
2,Worked Great Initially...then problems....,"We purchased the Weber 200 based on it's compact size & the good reviews that we found here on Amazon - and was pleased w/the grill's performance for approx 6 months until we decided to convert/using the convertor hose w/a 20lb LP tank. (The smaller portable tanks are OK but are not recycylable in our area.) Once we started to use the hose/tank combo, the safety mechanism on the regulator would be triggered, causing low flames/temperatures. We tried 'resetting' the grill MANY, MANY times, but did not have much luck. Too bad- have to throw away a good grill into the landfill and get another one (charbroil next time perhaps?)"
3,HANDY FOR TWO,"WHILE SMALL, THE WEBER Q200 IS EASY TO MOVE AND SET UP. THE SIZE IS RIGHT FOR TWO OR THREE PEOPLE . IT SHOULD BE USUABLE THROUGHOUT THE YEAR."
5,Meets expectations,"This is a great grill. I got mine a week ago and have used it extensively. It goes together very quickly and I was able to use mine right after taking it out of the box. It cooks extremely well. I have made burgers, chicken, eggplant and salmon on it so far and have been extremely happy with how even and fast the cooking has been."
5,Still amazed and very happy!!!,"A few years ago I purchased the small, portable Weber grill...about $50 at the time. I felt that it was good for what I wanted, but always desired something a little more...and, I ultimately found it in this Weber Q.Easiest grill I have ever put together...and I have done at least 6 over the years. Although the most of the other grills had an electric start button, they never worked properly. I always had to use matches. This Weber Q, however, starts without any problems.The cooking is extremely thorough...no uneven areas of uncooked or overcooked meat. The small cooking guide that came with the unit is very accurate in telling cooking times.Would I recommend this item? Definitely!My husband didn't understand why I wanted to buy it...we already had the small grill and it worked well enough...but now, after a few weeks with it, he sees that I made the right decision and is quite content with it.I love it..."
5,Good Action Flick!,"I gave this movie 5 stars because it is very watchable and will not disappoint Van Damme fans. There are several flaws to this movie though (Van Damme seems to be able to walk around and drive pretty well considering that he hasn't used his legs in 7 months), but overall there's great action scenes, good looking girls, a decent plotline, and some surprisingly good acting. It is not the greatest action movie of all time but it does the trick if you're in the mood for an action movie and it will definatly not dissapoint Van Damme fans."
5,Van Damme at His Best,"Jean-Claude Van Damme stars in this bone-chilling, action picked thriller as Anthony Lowe, a down-and-out detective addicted to heroin whose days always seem to go from bad to worse. Lowe is coming out of a drug deal in which two officers were killed and the primary villain, the drugs, the money and the surveillance tapes are still at large. Lowe is also dealing with his wife, who has just informed him that she is pregnant-but the child is not his. After a gunfight in which Lowe comes very close to death, he falls into a coma. Whilst on the road to recovery, Lowe finds himself in a very personal battle to make amends with his kidnapped wife and to take revenge on his assailant once and for all. His boss formerly refused to employ Lowe as a detective again, but, the teenager Lowe paid to research for information comes out with nuggets of gold which would stop the criminal activities for a long time to come. This brings Lowe back his credentials and his old job."
3,interesting love story,"This book has an intersting story with characters who you can believe. you have to love the man with a badge, matthew and with our heroine, you see sparks once they come together. she is given a second change to make something of herself. there are times when it is slow reading, but it also is a good book."
5,Really nice smaller watch,"My husband does not have big arms or hands and we have been looking for a smaller dress watch for awhile. Since most mens' watches today are enormous, heavy, too thick, very much in the way, it has not been easy to find a watch that was the right size and had a brown leather band and had the look he wanted -- but this one has it all. The downside, if this matters to you, is that the calendar is that little dot right above the 6 and it is small, can be hard to read. Nice looking on, works great, price was right, too."
5,Great watch. Love it.,"I have had this watch for over a year and I love it. I am female, and the size and look of this watch works great for me."
5,Thank You!!,Amazing book just as described. packed and delivered as promised. Will use this book for yrs to come and a welcomed addition to the book shelf.will use them in the future and would recommend them to anyone!
5,Great cheese book,I bought this book for my husband who loves cheese. He is enjoying all of the wonderful information and learning of cheeses he didn't know existed.
5,Great book for Cheese lovers,Great cheese reference guide. Not a complete encyclopedia (check out the world encyclopedia of cheese) but a great recommendation of the personal top 200 cheeses by a well known specialist in the field.Well worth it.
3,Good book,This is a very informative book but if you have any eye trouble the gray print makes it hard to read.
2,"not good, not bad","I have several other years of the SBK series' review and this was the worst. Comparing the production values from the '01 to this year: No rider interviews, no production bike reviews (steve parrish) and (this was the worst) no on-board camera footage; despite the fact the packaging and Duke Video say otherwise. The racing action is reasonably good and the commentating is reasonably good. In summary, a copy of what you'd see on TV with the on-board camera footage subtracted. Big let down for the price they're asking."
1,stunk,"Hess stinks, very monotonous vocals, only has one range. Bought to hear the pedal steel, but it is not worth sitting through her to try and achieve any listening pleasure. A real dud, I threw it out."
2,A 1-hour Breeze,"Trouble is, Tony Martinez is no devil. He comes across, in fact, as the ultimate boy scout in a shark-infested business. Part instructional, part ever-so-careful not to offend anyone, Martinez writes in a conversational, run-of-the-milll average-guy style that allows you to skim to the sections that may mean more to you. On the one hand, it's banal and boring and on the other, there are nut n' bolts insights that should be helpful for a rank beginner.As someone involved in the business for many years, looking for some hidden insights or juicy info, I was disappointed. But I DID learn a little more about the way pilot season works and for that reason alone, I found this very brief tome to have some worth."
5,A must read for actors early in their careers,20 word reviews - book reviews in 20 words or lessValuable information for new actors along with tips on managing your career once you've found an agent.
4,How to Dissent Effectively,"Christopher Hitchens has become known as one of the most independent thinkers in American punditry, so it is not surprising that he would write a book like ""Letters to a Young Contrarian."" In this short volume, Hitchens describes the mindset one needs in order to dissent when necessary, outlines good tactics to use when in opposition, dissects common arguments employed against those who oppose status quos, and provides great rejoinders to those arguments.Hitchens is mostly a man of the Left, but the book is very useful to conservatives today--during the Obama presidency the status quo is frequently a liberal status quo, so in 2010 it is conservatives who must often be contrarians."
2,"Not Gore Vidal, alas.","Other reviewers have certainly pointed out the book's and Hitchen's stong points, but I think that they're too generous. The remarkable thing about Hitchens is his rise to such great fame and authority on what is really a meagre spread. He likes to tout his receipt of the mantle from Gore Vidal, but he's neither as gifted as a writer nor as searching in his critique. It's possibly an unfair comparison, but it's one that we're invited to make, and given the contrast, the invitation seems more aggrandizing than accurate.This book, while fun, ... Well, to my eye, that's its strong point. It seems a bit of a knock-off and perhaps has it's audience among the fresh-faced and fawning.If I were looking for someone more in the line of Gore Vidal I'd suggest John Ralston Saul. Compared to Hitchens, Saul's observations and analyses are often more readable, delivered without the abrasion, and are part of a larger, coherent fabric."
3,on a practical level,"This is supposed to be a book for young people - I'm assuming by young they mean late high school or college.I am a high school teacher and I can tell you that Hitchens' repeated use of foreign phrases without translations (such as ""saeva indignatio"" - p. 8 and ""dei sacrificium intellectus"" - p. 23 and ""cette 'fugutive du camp des vainqueurs'"" - pp. 91-2) and his continual references to the 60s and the Cold War without any background will lose nearly every young person who attempts to read it.If by young, they meant 36 years old, than this 36 year old found the text to be interesting and challenging. However, I have to give it a poor score because he will fail to hit the stated target audience - and he will miss by a long shot."
5,Ode To Reason,"I have a bookshelf where my favorite ""desert island"" books are lined up. This jewel will soon be there. It is a polemic against on that fuzzy thinking that dominates so much of the chattering classes. It is a constant warning that we must be on our guard against mediocrity. And yes, it is an ode to Orwell and his relevance today.It is written in an economical style that is a pleasure to read. It makes it points -- the danger of intellectual compromise, the fakeness of religion -- clearly without falling into the pitfalls of heavy theory.My only quibble is with the title. ""Young Contrarian?"". This is a wakeup call to all those readers, many of them a little older than ""young"" -- who have found an intellectual comfort zone that offends nobody."
4,The Hitch on How to B*tch,"How to Lose Friends and Alienate People, courtesy of Christopher Hitchens. Mr Hitchens is always a joy to read. While this is not to my mind the best of his work, it is a solid addition to the library of any respectable skeptic."
5,Life Changing advice and comments,"For people who feel they have never fit in with many groups of people, introverts , or people who dont agree with societies so called "" truths"" This book shows you that being in the minority/minority opinion , doesnt make you wrong, or a freak . Most of the time it means that your seeing things more clearly, and in most cases that your right. This book has many gems of life changing advice. The main Purpose of this book is to get you to speak with your own voice, and not be afraid of confrontation or opposition , becuase when you speak in your own voice, you will never be the only one."
4,Stirred but not shaken,"Recently stumbled onto this little book that wants to make a stir, somewhere, somehow. I think that wanting to become a national best-seller is on the list for Hitchens, i.e., to write something intellectual, controversial and garner broad public attention (like the Closing of the American Mind was for Mr. Bloom). Both authors are roughly in the same camp and enjoy the fine art of biting.But I could be wrong in my impression and perhaps this is just for those rebels on the fringe who enjoy free thought. But there is something ambitious about this book. If Thomas Paine could write pamphlets and be famous, why not Hitchens! Not to detract from what Hitchens is saying throughout the book, it is a good message, and the cover gives us the right image of the rebel (Bogey and Dean). But will America be stirred, provoked? Probably not and controversy remains more in the hands of the irrationally rational, eg., somebody like a David Lynch. Still a good biting message!"
3,Okay,"Not really impressed with the animation, and since this has a previous storyline I didn't quite catch on until half way thru"
3,Some Knowledge of Original Series Needed,"Winter of 1992 I was introduced to an English Subtitled tape of Sol Bianca... Yes, it was good, it had its interesting points... Sol Bianca 2, however, seemped to ramp things up a bit.( And left you in a seriously big lurch at the end, making me wish there was more out there)However, that clifhanger ending of Sol Bianca 2 was what made the previous reviewer's comment about Jun's association with the ship click in my head. I've got the first tape, looking forward to the remaining 4 episodes."
3,Nortenos a Morir,"bueno pues no ese a esribe muy bien en espanole so voy a escribe en enigles well i really like you music expecially your cumbias,Que Dios Los Biendiga a todos.#1 fan"
2,Cheap but USELESS,"I had a old zenith that lasted over 5 years and was great. I thought this zenith would be the same but it was far from being as good as its older models. Although low priced, this zenith LACKS A LOT. First, there is no display. Five separate squares light up for various functions such as play and record but they don't let you know whether your rewinding or fast forwarding so you don't know when you've finished winding the tape. Furthermore, the cassette tape is a hassle to load into this VCR. You can't just push the cassette into the VCR in any ole way. The loading bracket in the VCR is so loose that the cassette has to be pushed into the VCR at a perfect 90 degrees. Otherwise, the cassette gets stuck at you have to press the eject button and pry the cassette out with a screwdriver. Overall, this poorly designed VCR is hardly worth the price. Your better off trying another VCR at the same price."
5,Very good kinife,"Smaller than a regular size SAK, but just as useful. Because these alox models have no toothpick and tweezers, they have a very thin profile. I'm, gonna try using the tip of the nail file as a toothpick and see how it works out. Great basic toolset."
4,Almost perfect,"I bought this as a backup for my larger pocket knife, and in that role it serves admirably. I carry it with my keys and it's gotten rather dinged up (that aluminum isn't very durable) but it's only cosmetic damage, so who cares?. I find myself using the tools more than the knife and they work well, the nail file makes a decent prybar. One problem (and the reason I did not give this five stars) is the file, WTF? I mean seriously? I don't know how many people pull out their SAK and give themselves a manicure, but I doubt they are a majority, I would have preferred a pair of scissors, even if it had added a little bulk. Scissors have far more utility for everyday use.Edit Dec22: I also just noticed that the nail file contacts the upper edge of the knife doing more (cosmetic) damage. Bloody nail file."
4,Good pocket knife,"I've owned the Soldier, which is larger and has an awe, for some time. I really like the Soldier but wanted something a little lighter and smaller, more pocketable. The Cadet is very similar, no awe but has a nail file. A very useful knife to have in your pocket all the time. Only upgrade wish would be a locking knife blade while keeping the size and weight the same."
4,Just the right size,"I was could not make up my mind between this one vs the Pioneer. I am glad I went with Cadet because it fits just right in the little coin pock of my Jeans. I like the minimalist approach to everything I carry, wallet, led flashlight, and pocket knife."
5,Great little knife,"I bought five of these, one for me and one for each of my groomsmen. The Metal sodes are much nicer than the normal red plastic sides for Swiss Army knives, in my opinion. They were very well received."
5,Aretha Gospel Greats,Aretha has a voice of an Angel.. Awesome CD. Fast shipping and the quality of the CD was excellent. A must have for your gospel collection..
2,Not what i expected.,If you are a fan of ms.franklin then you should buy it but if you want to here good gospel music then keep your money.
1,Dull Knell,"Love the singer, not the song, or something like that. Unfortunately his CD did not ring my bell; but I am not a big fan of church music unless it's Bach. Because I had enjoyed the Hollywood version of gospel as showcased in the interesting film ""The Apostle"" I decided to give this CD a listen. Unfortunately I found much of the CD to be poorly orchestrated, slowly paced, with Aretha being dwarfed by the loud enthusiastic choir. So if you are not an aficionado of this genre of music you probably won't like it. Enough said."
3,lug nuts,these lug nuts are right on. Lug nuts just like any other I guess. Hope the metal is not recycles tuna cans!
5,FROM LA TO TX,"I'M FROM LOUISIANA AND I ALREADY LOVE THA SOUTH MUSIC.WHEN I FRIST HEARD SOUJA SLIM FIRST CD I JUST BANGING IT ALL DAY. I GOT ALL HIS SINCE.THIS ALBUM STR8 ANG FROM FRONT TO BACK,I HEARDTHE SINGLE ""PAY FOR IT "" AND LIKE BUT WHEN I GOT THE CD THAT WAS JUST THE BEGINNING.LOVE THE BEST OF THE BEST.GET ASAP WON'T BE DISSAPPOINTED""TRUST ME"".HOLLA"
1,Awful!,I expected more than a handful of moves done quickly but over and over and over and overad infinitum! It drove me mad!
2,"Not the kind of ""easy"" I was looking for","Yes, this yoga DVD is ""easy"", but only from a fitness standpoint. You won't be out of breath, and it's easy in that way. However, I was looking for yoga that was easy in a flexibility way. I am so inflexible that some of the poses were still too hard for me in this DVD. I made do with blocks and straps, but I wouldn't call it ""easy"" for someone as inflexible as me. However, the thing I really didn't like about it is that she goes through the poses way too quickly. Yoga is supposed to be about being in the moment and really stretching out a muscle. She goes so quickly that by the time you've gotten into a pose, she's already telling you to get out of it. This does not make it harder, per say; it just doesn't feel very ""yoga-like"". How can I stretch a muscle when I'm only in the pose for less than 5 seconds?"
2,A disappoinment,"When the title said it was ""Easy"", I was expecting at the least some instruction. I had intended to give this to a friend of mine who could benefit from yoga and was receptive to trying. However, this video would have had just the opposite effect on her, I'm afraid. There is little to no instruction, it seems rushed, and does not show yoga as relaxing, as it should. If you are truly a beginner and want instruction and a real flavor of what yoga is and can do for you, this is not the video you want. Also, the introduction is too long and is bothersome."
2,Easy Yoga by Suzanne Deason,I was looking for a beginner yoga tape and thought the title easy yoga would be what I needed. I have never done yoga before and this tape does not explain the various moves and breathing required. This may be a good tape for someone with a knowledge of yoga.
4,The title says it all!,"Y&T; was and is one of the greatest rock bands of alltime and it's ashame they don't get the credit theydeserve. I first heard them in the 80's before thebig hair metal explosion and they are far superior.This albums while not as great as previous albums isstill a great rock record and just like before waslike nothing else out there. Songs like Cold Day inHell, Fly Away and Don't know what to do are greatrock songs and show Dave plays guitar like no one else.But it also has a classic slow song No Regrets that willmake you cry and I say it's a Y&T; classic! So give it achance if your a fan or not and enjoy a great rock band."
3,Half way there,"I suppose this cd is about half way there. It has some good songs on it Long way down, quicksand, 21st century, confusion, and no regrets. The rest of it is pretty fair for y t. I would still get it if your a big y t fan."
1,Too bad!,"This album is just not any good! Nothing of the earlier Y&T is present and that's a pity. Turn to ""Struck down"", ""Earthshaker"", ""Black tiger"" and ""Mean streak"" instead."
2,Y & T rocks,"Yesterday and Today have always been a great rock band. It's just too bad ""real"" rock died out. This album has everything you could want. Explosive guitars, great vocals, screaming solos, and pounding drums. If you want rock, go with Y & T."
2,Publisher went to press without allowing for a final edit.,"I was a contributing photographer for this book. At the last minute, a major contributor failed to meet his agreement. I was contacted through my website, CopCruisers, and agreed to submit photographs in 24 hours. When the pictures were submitted, the publisher agreed to select the photographs and allow me to write the captions. Next thing I knew, the book was in print. The author, Ian Kerr, could not have had time to identify the pictures, much less do the captions justice. I believe the editor/publisher was commited to a delivery date and cut every corner to meet it. The result was a less then satisfactory outcome. For my debut, I was very unhappy. Publishing is a business, but this English publishing company went too far."
1,Awful,As a prior Police Officer I often look for picture books on the subject. This book was worse than poorly done. Grainy quality photos with wrong/idiotic captions. The one thing that made me laugh out loud was the picture of an unmarked cruiser without any cop detailing at all (SO IN EFFECT IT WAS A PHOTO OF A CHEVY IN A PARKING LOT). How stupid!
2,"Interesting, but not very well done.","Kerr has compiled some interesting photos of police cars but the overall quality of the book is not as good as some of the others already on the market. Many of the photos are poorly reproduced, and there is an overabundance of NYC cars. A couple of the photos are wrongly captioned, i.e. he identifies a Ford as a Dodge. It is also obvious that Kerr is not a U.S. police officer as some of his terminology is different than used here."
4,Works great with MacBook Air,"I purchased the MacBook Air for the portability and wanted to find an equally portable mouse. The Kensington Pocket Mouse is a great product and works well with my MacBook Air. The mouse is small and is easy to slip into a small pocket on my briefcase. My only complaint is that I wish I'd seen the Pocket Mouse with the retractable USB cable. That would be the perfect traveling accessory, in my opinion."
2,unstable cursor,"I've had two of these. The first became almost unusable. The second is similar, but not so bad -- so far. The cursor is unstable, and sometimes drifts when not in use. After a month on the second one I replaced it with a LogicTech mouse, which was about the same size and price, much more reliable, and easier to travel with because the cord winds onto the mouse and clips snugly with a clever clip-on USB connector."
5,Great little mouse,"This is a great mouse if you don't use your laptop's track pad. Easy to use, long usb cord, and can be used on a PC or Mac. I love it"
2,Difficult to install,"Had a hard time installing this on a WIN-XP Home Acer Aspire one Netbook.The normal let machine search for drivers try but it failed to install.Tried downloading the manufacturer's software. Running it clobbered things. Blue screen of death.Finally after getting the PC working again, I installed the driver from a list called HID Mouse. Works OK now. Frustrating.Interesting that I plugged the same mouse into an IBM laptop and it just worked."
2,Not a wireless mouse.,"Don't go by the picture posted by Amazon. Its not a wireless mouse. Its USB wired mouse. Works well, no complains. But if you are looking into buying this because as wireless mouse (as shown) in the picture then this is not for you."
3,"Good while new, although cursor jumped","Pro:1. very long cord (I no longer have USB ports in my keyboard, so this is essential)2. Two button, one scrollwheel design easily adaptable for right or left hands3. compact size and low profile comfortable for small handsCon:1. skipping cursor2. a little picky about tracking surfaces3. Cord attachment isn't sturdy, even with careful use. Began getting wobbly after second year of ownership, necessitating holding cord still between middle and third fingers while moving. Had to replace mouse before third year."
5,Great travel mouse,"I've had this mouse for 1.5 years now and use it when on the road, during off site presentations, and when working at home. It's compact, comes with a stuff sack, and best of all works on my thigh while I'm trapped in a crowded airplane."
3,Doesn't work on some standard desktops,"My main gripe about this mouse is that it is somewhat picky about what surfaces it will work with. I have other optical mice that work fine on my standard grey desk; however, the Kensington Optical Pocketmouse just won't work on that surface. It will work on mousepads and many wood surfaces, however. It's a decent mouse otherwise, but I expect more versatility from a device designed for travel."
4,inexpensive and great performance,I have used this with my ThinkPad for several months now and it has been flawless.
5,Works fine for older notebooks,"I put this card in the PCMCIA slot, installed the Win98 drivers, and I was on the net in no time flat.This card was just what I needed for my old IBM Thinkpad, since it doesn't have 32 bit card slots.No complaints, works like it should."
5,Children's counting book,"This little counting book is one which we read to our children many years ago.We now have two grandchildren and our adult children wished they had that book which we read to them for thier children.Thanks to Amazon and some thoughtful pack rats, this out of print childrens book is working it's majic on another generation."
5,Love Chicka Chicka,I bought this for my classroom. I wanted the Scholastic version of the movie and this is it. My students love the song and so do I! Nice bonus that there are several other movies included on the DVD.
3,decent product,"was a little disappointed with what this was. I thought it would keep the attention of my three year old and she was actually a little bored after the chicka chicka boom boom song was over. Quality was good, just not excited about the dvd"
5,Wonderful DVD,Helps with letter recognition in a fun tune and video. You won't be able to get the song out of your head. Kids LOVE it.
3,Works but they're awfully flimsy,"This product works ok but all these drip trays would be much better if they made the plastic tray out of rigid plastic. It would be a lot easier to keep them straight and level. As it is, they're so flimsy they bow and hang down on the sides. I'm thinking of gluing something rigid to the bottom of it to keep it straight."
2,Toilet Drip Tray did not fit.,Maybe these would work on other toilets but did not fit my toilets. I tried to install one and broke it. I did not return these just pitched them in the garbage. Just be sure it will work before you try to install it around the supply line. That is how I broke the one I got.
2,Un libro muy pequeno,"This book is tiny, in comparison to it's English counterpoint. Still very good information. I am a nurse and I use this book to loan to parents that I work with. It's so small it's almost difficult to read.Esta libro es muy pequeno, la edition en inglese es mucho mas grande con mas information. Todavia esta libretto tiene information buena y importante. Soy una enfermera y lo di a mis clientes. Es tan pequeno que es casi dificil leer lo."
3,Satisfactorio pero no excelente,"El libro cumple con lo que promete: te da una introducción a la técnica del lenguaje de señas para bebés, pero sólo incluye algunas señas y te sugiere que compres un diccionario de señas para mayor información; tiene tips y técnicas para enseñarle las señas a los bebés y hasta algunas canciones populares en español, en general es bueno."
4,Great for certain phones - TRUE STEREO,"I owned a pair for 1 year that I bought for my VX8100 and they worked great for an in-the-ear headset. I accidentally left my old pair on a plane and am now purchasing a second set. I generally dislike earbuds, but like the fit and feel of how these securely fit. The bass is a little weak compared to larger headsets and an in-line volume control would be nice, but overall great and easy to roll up and put in the pocket. These are TRUE Stereo, so if your phone does not put out 2 channel audio they will not work correctly and you may get only a single side to play. Most 2.5MM headsets are mono out of both sides."
5,Excelent ear set,"We received the product on a very timely manner. The ear-set is exactly what we wanted, nothing fancy, just to use in the car while talking over phone and driving, and no need for charger/battaries is a huge huge plus."
2,Only worked for a couple of weeks!,"I recently wrote a review where I gave this product 5 stars, because it was working so great and was so comfortable. Unfortunately, within a couple of days of writing it, the headphones stopped working correctly. All of a sudden, only one side (the left one) worked. Also, I wasn't even working out or anything, so I never did anything to cause this to happen. I was simply sitting on my couch relaxing when suddenly one side stopped working. This is why I can only give this product now 2 stars- one star for each week that it worked!"
3,jabra stereo earbuds,"they are great earbuds, they are soft to fit around your ears and great sound and they last a long time but the soft rubber ear pieces that fit in your ears come off to easily and get lost and then you cant order more and the headset it useless."
5,Best pair of headphones for any 3mm phone,"I was very impressed by these headphones! I use them all the time! I wanted a pair that wraps around my ear, because I hate the buds. Plus, they came with 2 different rubber attachments for the earpieces (to increase comfortability to each customer.I took a chance and got 3 pairs, to get free shipping. I gave one pair to my mother who absolutely loved them as well. They are the best pair for phones that you can get anywhere and very reasonably priced! If I had need for more, I would choose this pair!"
1,Not Compatable,"Before purchasing this headset, be sure to test compatibility with your phone. Music through this headset was only audible through only one ear. the talk/hang-up button toggled sound in the other ear when held down but didn't perform any of the usual functions.I was under the impression that there was some sort of headset standard, apparently that is not the case."
4,Beware of clones...Get retail product,"Beware of clone versions of this product. They look almost identical and even have jabra labelled, but it will also mention ""special model"" on the label. I order a pair online and the sound quality was brutal. However, went to Best Buy and got them and the quality was great, still have some issues with the connector into my cell phone. (It has to be in just right for the sound to come out at max quality.I would recommend"
4,Jabra C220,I bought these for use on my cell phone. Comfort wise its great but I had to play around with it a bit to get the max sound.
3,Good but not great,"I purchased these for around $20USD. The dual jabra gels are nice, but the longer gels seemed to relay the sound better than the 'stubby' ones. I have since lost the long gels, thus forced into using the stubby ones until I can track down replacements. If you use a 'phone to standard 3.5mm adapter' don't expect the hands free button to work. I tested this on an smt5600 and a v3i with no success. If using for strictly music these are reasonable headphones at a good price(They stay seated in your ears while running as long as you keep the cord tucked). Bass is rather low, but overall decent sound quality for the price."
3,They are decent except a lil weak in design,"The gels fit a whole lot nicer then most earbuds,the part that goes over your ear can be a lil annoying if worn for a long period of time but its not that bad.Biggest problem for me and i have owned 2 pair of these headphones is the wiring.If you ever drop your phone or accidentally jerk the cord a few times you will end up with a short in the wire.When that occurs you only get sound out one headphone,the 2nd one will only work if you play with the wire but wont play consistently.If they could fix the weak wiring i would give it a better score,til then i shop for a replacement."
2,Poor Quality,Sound is good on this headset but manufacturing quality very poor. Returned the first set because the connector came apart. The replacement set Amazon sent had the same problem which I decided to fix with super glue. I think I would look elsewhere for my next headset. I've had good luck with Jabra in the past but bad experience here
3,"Jabra C220s - decent sound, not fully compatible","I bought these for my Motorola E815 phone, which has a built-in mp3 player. They are fine for listening to music, although bass response is somewhat lacking (could also be a product of playback from the phone). They will mute when a call comes in, however, the music does not resume at the end of the call. I have to open the phone, go back into the Sounds menu and start over again. Geeshhh. I guess I will have to buy the Motorola earbuds (HS120)."
2,This review is for usage with Palm Treo 750,"I wanted this item because I wanted to go running and use my palm treo as a music player. Everything about this product is excellent, it fits in the ear and comes with an adapter that converts the 2.5 to a 3.5 input. The only problem is I got screwed by its sophisticated adapter. There is a screw pattern towards the bottom of the jack thats used to screw into the adapter. This is good in that the adapter will NEVER come off and its shut tight but when I try to plug it into my palmtreo (2.5mm) it doesn't go in all the way because of the screw pattern. In order to use it for my treo I have to use the adapter (3.5mm) and then use my own adapter to convert it back into 2.5mm. It works but I had to modify it and when I go running I have to make sure my phone is fully charged if not it will die fast because of the two adapters."
1,Not compatible,Does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125. Only 1 channel works unless the button is pressed and then the 2nd channel is present only faintly.When connect to my laptop audio (via the included adapter) it worked correctly.
1,Work great - for six months maybe,"I've bought two sets of these because they're one of the few 2.5 mm stereo over-the-ear headphones i could find for my blackberry mp3. The first set worked almost a year and then one of the earphones stopped working all together, leaving me with one ear for ""stereo"" sound. The second set worked 4 or 5 months before the exact same thing happened. Before they stopped working, the sound was great. But I wouldn't but them again."
2,Not for use with HTC 8125,"I bought these to replace the uncomfortable earbuds that came with my T-Mobile MDA (AKA the HTC 8125, HTC Wizard, Dopod). The sound is good unfortunately it only plays through one ear. The HTC 8125 (and other HTC products) use a proprietary 2.5 mm connector that has 4 conductors. Even though I have found 2.5mm 4c connector headsets evidently the conductor order is different.Bottom line, don't buy these to use with an HTC product."
2,Only for Stereo mp3 playing phones,"I got this for a friend that is a bit hard of hearing. This sound is great, but will not work with non MP3 phones. I wish it had said this in big letters on the ad."
3,You need an adapter (that ma not exist) for most phones,"Cons:Because it designed for 3 channels (left & right speakers, Microphone) on a 2.5mm plug it does not work any phone that was designed from 2 channels (single speaker, microphone). There is no adapter provided for people without the newest phones designed specifically for a 2.5mm 3 channel plug.Hope this clears-up the issues everyone is having with Jabra's product.(...)Pros:The ear buds are extremely comfortable.It comes with an 3.5mm adapter to use with standard audio equipment.Sound quality is excellent.Microphone clarity and pickup is very good."
2,"Comfortable, but ...","When I read the review about the Jabra C120S, I found some similarities to the kind of problems I have with the Jabra C220S, so I decided to write this review.I bought this headset for my phone equipped PDA. I will let you read the pros about this product as it is mentioned in the item description, and will only mention the cons to save you time:* First thing I noticed is that the cord is relatively short...at least 8"" shorter than a standard headset cord.* When I inserted the 2.5 mm jack, I heard one side speaker working. The other was not. I had to pull the jack about 1/32"" out to be able to get sound from both earpieces.* The auto answer button is not functioning at all.Other than this I do agree with all the Pros mentioned above."
1,This product doesn't work right,The first time I used this product I went for a walk.. At first i could hear nothing then i jiggled the wires around a lil and then i got distorted music and no words.. So I then tried to answer a call with it and it didn't work i could not hear the other person and they could not hear me.. I would not ecomend this product to anyone it is a total rip off. I am very disapointed..
2,mono sound,"feel awesome, but only one side of my brand new pair works. so bummed that i can only get sound in one side. gonna buy a new pair and hope for the best."
4,Good book but a strong background on calculus required.,"This book will tell you everything you need to learn on differential equations. It covers thoroughly the methods for solving first and second order differential equations. The book also extends into Fourier transforms. I used this book at MIT for the differential equations class and found it very useful. Within its contents, matlab exercises are present and some simple projects which lets the student apply its knowledge. The only problem with the book is that it can be hard to read at certain points. Also the author assumes a strong background in calculus."
2,"Even worse than ""Dutch""","I found this effort even worse than Morris'es Dutch fiasco. At least in that book, Morris really made an effort at analysis of Reagan.Listening to the books on tape version of this book, at least, it seemed more like a mere listing of accomplishments and citing of diary entries. There was no follow-on analysis of TR's actions.Morris needs to find different work."
1,Awful reader voice destroys interesting story,"I love Theodore Roosevelt. I liked Morris's first book. I listened to it on CD during long commutes, and Morris's inflections and imitations of TR were very entertaining. Then they got Harry Chase to read the second installment. And it is HORRIBLE. He just drones on and on in this nasal near-monotone voice. I can't even finish listening to it because I just can't stand his grating, boring voice, despite how much I want to hear Morris's take on the rest of TR's presidency. I'll just get the book from the library and read it for myself."
3,Fair,"This is actually a book my husband read. He's very into presidential history, and he was a big fan of Morris's first TDR book. However, he found this book to be less interesting than the first. It was a more scholarly look at TDR than the first book, and it just did not hold his attention as well as the first book. Yet I know when the third book in this series comes out, he'll be there to get that one as well."
3,Lost in prose,"After reading McCullough's TRUMAN and Steven Ambrose EISENHOWER I looked to this book with interest in a facinating president. McCullough and Ambrose books are equal to Theodore Rex in academics but were more readable than Morris is. While it contains great detail about the life and times I did not get to know the man, Roosevelt, like I had Truman and Eisenhower in the other books. The book is more appropriate as an academic history than a readable book that anyone can pick up and read."
1,Not a fan of this author,"I heartily agree with other negative reviews of this book. I have voraciously read most of David McCullough's books, along with a host of other authors' historical works, and I so wanted to like this book. It lived on my nightstand for months, and unfortunately its only virtue was that it routinely put me to sleep after a page or two every night. I had borrowed it from a colleague, and eventually returned it only partially read. Lest one think that my ""boredom threshold"" may be a a bit low, realize that I have stayed up nights reading many English gardening books that I find ""thrilling"" by comparison to this book! Clearly I'm not planning on seeking out any additional works by Morris."
4,Fun for the political historian,"This book is well researched and interesting if you enjoy political--and to some extent, military--history. It is also a fast-paced read, because throughout the author chooses to frequently shift scenes. My one criticism would be that the author does not dwell on Roosevelt's home life as much as a social historian might hope. He does offer some interesting anecdotes in that direction, but the biography is primarily a study of the President's two terms in office."
2,Where is Edith? Where is Bamie?,"Mr. Morris totally dismisses two of TR's lifelong most trusted advisors, his wife Edith and his older sister Bamie. We get two pages on Edith and a few scattered mentions of Bamie and his younger sister Corinne. Despite the fact that Alice was rarely on good terms with her father before her White House marriage, we see more photos and read more of Alice (who TR referred to as his ""liability daughter"" and his other daughter Ethel as his ""asset daughter"") than we do his beloved partner and wife Edith. Perhaps Edith will receive better treatment in Morris's upcoming third and concluding tome on TR's life and careers.TR did not live through eight years in the White House in a vacuum from his wife, sisters, and ""other"" children. Yet, one would never know this from reading ""Theodore Rex"". If you want to learn more about how his family influenced him and was affected by his decisions and mood swings, read Kathleen Dalton's recently published ""A Strenous Life""."
1,Trust others at your peril,"Wow, there are either a lot of Morris family members writing reviews or people who like ponderous prose. Granted, TR's presidential years were full of trust-busting and nature conservation -- not the stuff of thrilling biography -- but Morris is able to squeeze the life out of even the most interesting events. His self-important language, misused vocabulary, and pathetic metaphors will leave you howling in pain. If you like good biography, read McCullough. Run from this book."
1,"Ugh, heavy book","...Suffice it to say that I consider this to be an endless, horrid book. I think Ed Morris is a poor writer who continues to inflict murky, long, tiresome tomes and inspire the same sort of writing in his fans. My main complaint is that he's doing this to T. Roosevelt, who is one of our more exciting and interesting Presidents. The recent book by Auchincloss or ""The Last Romantic"" are finer books, if not what those interested finally deserve."
1,"TOO MUCH FLUFF, TOO LITTLE SUBSTANCE.","Theodore Rex is boring, ponderous, plodding and uninspired. Too much fluff and too little substance."
1,Reads like a novel rather than academic research,"After reading several books about the Founding Fathers and other Presidents, I was excited to read about Teddy. Now in most books they discuss personalities, events, and impacts of decisions. This book read like a cheesy novel with unncessary flowery language. There are lines that were shown as dialogue, when the information was probably gleened from several correspondence. He writes about facial expressions during conversations. Morris even wrote about what they thought during events. Most writers would state, ""He would recall later...""If I had wanted to read a novel, I would have. I was disappointed not with the subject, just the way it was written."
1,Very Little Facts only Prose,"Considering the length of this book, the reader should come away knowing a great deal about one of our greatest presidents. Unfortunately, Edmund Morris is writing in the same style as Michael and Jeff Shaara. The only difference is that the Shaaras lists their books as fiction. This book is filled with Morris' opinions and musings on what T.R. was thinking. This book was a waste of my time and should not be listed as a historical biography. If you want to read a book on T.R., then pick up Mornings on Horseback."
4,"Very readable, but is it all true?","Subject: Review of Theodore Rex, by Edmund MorrisThis well-written biography could convince even skeptics that Theodore Roosevelt was the most interesting man ever to be President of the United States. The book draws the reader into many interesting events during Roosevelt's presidency, adding colorful personalities to the mix. Nonetheless, Morris' use of a fictional character in his biography of Ronald Reagan encourages suspicion. How does the biographer know what Roosevelt was thinking in so many situations? Without exhaustive research into the author's sources, the typical reader will never be quite sure."
5,Captivating,"Edmund Morris' history of the Roosevelt Presidency is fantastic, one reads about the time and events of as well as Roosevelt the man. Unlike ""The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt"" (which focuses on the maturation and personal development of Roosevelt) this concentrates on his Presidency. If one if more interested in the events and politics of the time, this is the book to read. However, I found reading both volumes (The Rise of... followed by Theodore Rex) allowed the story in the latter to be far more interesting and complete. Theodore Rex is a must read for history fans."
2,Needs More Editing,"After the wonderful first biography, this book was a letdown. While TR is a great subject and there are some entertaining anecdotes, this book bogs the reader down with too much detail, to the point where it was truly boring on too many occasions."
3,A bit disappointed,"After reading The Rise Of Theodore Roosevelt, I anxiously started Theodore Rex. I must admit to being a bit disappointed. Either the story of TR is not as exciting once he became president or Morris became bored with his subject. Theodore Rex just doesn't crackle with life as The Rise of... did. It is still a good read, not just up to the high standard set by The Rise of TR."
5,A must read for both content and style of author and subject!,"This is the first of the three books by this author that I read from a friends library. Since my great grandfather rode with the Rough Riders I have always had a passing interest in Teddy Roosevelt. Now after reading this book I am all in - could not stop until I read all three books on the life of Teddy Roosevelt by Morris. Morris seems to be the best biographer out there for T.R. and it's no surprise that he won a Pulitzer prize!Since I am writing this review months after reading this book, I will not go into more detail except that it is a must read for anyone who enjoys biographies and/or wants to learn more about one of the most unique and energetic leaders in American history!"
5,"It started with Leadership: past, Present & Future by Carlos M. Rivera","After reading the book Leadership: Past, Present & Future by Carlos M. Rivera he talks about Theodore Roosevelt as one of the best Past Leaders, and at the back he has a list of recommended great books one of them is The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt By Edmund Morris and this one. When you read Leadership: Past, Present & Future is like the best of Theodore Roosevelt and you want to learn more about him and about others leaders in the book. After reading the 3 books I have learn to admire him more and more."
5,Fit as a Bull Moose,"This is one of the best books ever done on a US president. Morris, after a less than satisfactory turn as Ronald Reagan's biographer, is in fine form and I cannot wait for the next volume in this series.Morris brings a real understanding of his subject in this book, the second in a series, projected to include three volumes. Prior to Morris, there were any number of fine books that dealt with TR's era, but each had its failings. I am happy to state that at last Teddy Roosevelt has found a biography that is worthy of his greatness.The strengths of the book are easy to list. First of all Morris knows his subject. He also understands the era and is very good about providing context. This last quality is something that is necessary in all great biographies, but is lacking in most of them. I cannot wait for the next installment."
3,"A great subject, but simply too long.","TR was, by any estimation, one of the greatest Presidents in U.S. history. His reforms were sweeping, well-timed, and continue to generate change. However, I was not greatly impressed with Morris' treatment of the subject. Particularly, there was a bit too much description of events that I viewed as having little relevance. For example, sometimes several pages would be used to describe minute details of a particular hunting trip. TR was an avid sportsman and I agree that these types of insights can give a better picture of the man. However, when this treatment is applied to every event, the book just tends to get longer and longer.My only gripe was that the book often got bogged down in minor details. If it were a bit more concise, it would be a must read. As it stands, I consider it good but not great."
2,Dull and disappointing,"I have twice tried to get through this book, but I'm finally giving up for good. The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt (Morris) was a spectacular book, so I really wanted to like this one, too. I don't know what happened, but both Teddy and Morris got incredibly dull this time around. The book just moves at a painfully slow pace and includes way too much irrelevant detail."
3,Strangely and surprisingly ... dull,"Put together one of today's most interesting biographers with one of American history's most interesting and dynamic figures and you get ... a surprisingly uninteresting book. Although I loved the first volume of Morris' Roosevelt biography, this one leaves me flat. I think it's because the story of the ""making"" of Roosevelt is just so much more compelling than his years in office. Like any politician, TR must lose his bluster and bravado and become ... an administrator, dealing with sensitive political matters large and small. TR's just not as interesting when he's engaged in day-to-day politics, a tame version of his former self."
2,Fiction?,"""Theodore Rex"" is not a bad book, actually it is quite entertaining. However, the irrelevant detail that describes the life of ""Teddy"" is in no way substantiated by footnotes, nor - in all likelihood - could it be. It is therefore a very questionable biography if after all, the reader is constantly kept guessing what is true and what is Mr. Morris' invention.I would therefore suggest to list it as ""Fiction"""
2,gave up,Gave up after the second chapter. Writing is just too flowery and I read lots of bios. Will look for another bio about TR.
2,Where is Teddy?,"I came to know Teddy Roosevelt intimately in The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt. In Theodore Rex, I learned about many historical facts I cared about and many more that were so trivial that I wondered why Morris included them. His prose is flowery and his research is exhaustive, but where is Teddy? I couldn't put the first book down. This book I put down often and didn't want to pick it back up. I missed Teddy in this book. He inspired me to be a better person in the first book. In Theodore Rex, I learned more about history and less about the man and his family."
1,Print too small,"I am 46 with good eyesight, but I am not willing to spend the effort trying to read this book with the small print.I am hoping the hardback is better."
2,Irritating reading of a fine book (audio edition),"An excellent treatment of Roosevelt's presidential years, but seriously -- fatally, in my opinion -- compromised by a highly irritating reading. The reader is responsible for a number of audio books, and this one shares the same shortcomings of voice, interpretation, pronunciation, and mannered mimicry. Read the book; choose another audio volume."
3,A great man and an a good book,"Just wanted to add my two cents in agreement about the overbearing writing of this book. It often got in the way of my enjoying the tale of America's larger than life leader.Along the same lines, there was a large amount of frustration with the overacted narration by the reader on the Audio CDs. He spent the whole time doing a Teddy impression that soon wore thin.However, anything that can bring such a great and interesting person as TR to life is still very worthwhile even overlooking a few faults."
4,A beatiful but not very objective biography,"""Theodore Rex"", written by Edmund Morris, tells in a beautiful and involving way the story of Roosevelt's presidency. Probably this book will become the standard text on this part of Roosevelt's life and in fact it is written not only in a wonderful style but it is also very precise and based on a careful and meticolous research. Anyway I have found quite annoying the tendence of the author to mix historical facts with invented descriptions of places or of the character's feelings. I think this technique, while certainly makes the book more interesting, reduces the objectiveness of the narration. In any case the work is remarkable for the way in which it makes the reader understand Roosevelt's actions and personality."
5,Is Morris going to complete the trilogy?,Is there any word as to whether or not Edmund Morris is going to complete the planned trilogy? I'd love to know more about TR's hunting trips to Africa and South America as well as the election of 1912...
5,America's Churchill,"Mr. Morris introduces another generation to a great american, a renaissance man who broke tradition to create the modern, activist presidency. In superb detail we see Theodore Roosevelt as politician, statesman, diplomatist, speaker, conservationist, naturalist, philospher, linguist, scholar, public servant, military commander-in-chief,and negotiator. The depth and breadth of his knowledge while president is amazing. Only Winston Churchill was his equal, in my opinion."
5,Genius,"Morris's TR books are not the best presidential biographies I have ever read -- Caro's LBJ series receives that honor. But the TR books are certainly the best written.Morris is essentially spinning a yarn, telling the tale of an astounding and unbelievable character who, incidentally, happened to be a real person. Morris writes like a great epic novelist, and Teddy Roosevelt is the perfect protagonist.Theodore Rex, and its predecessor, are unlike any other biographies I've read. They move quickly and flow freely, and come off like a great action adventure. These are biographies for lovers of the genre, yes, but also for those who would think they couldn't stomach cracking the spine on one."
5,"Separating ""public opinion"" from ""public interest""","Teddy Roosevelt accomplished so many things I never knew of until reading this book, which tells Roosevelt's story in a consistently entertaining manner. In addition to really painting a colorful picture of Roosevelt, Morris does a great job of capturing the times in which Roosevelt lived, making the book a great primer on America and the world at the turn of the last century.Roosevelt did a nice job of separating what the public wanted from what would do it the most good. He was a long-term thinker and a person who could weigh both sides of an issue and find the solution that took both sides into account (often with the end result of making everyone mad at him rather than just one side.) Rooseevelt negotiated treaties and intitiated projects (like the Panama Canal) that changed the direction of world history.Fantastic book for fans of history and biography."
4,PLANTLIFE-Rosewood Geranium,"I gave this product by Plantlife onoly 4/5 stars because while I love how it makes my bathroom smell, the scent of the soap doesn't stay on my hands like I would wish it to. Still, it's a great soap and smells nice when I'm lathering up. I think I will explore more of Plantlife's soaps for my hands. I will not trade in, however, their Rosemary Tea Tree brand! That is perhaps the best soap I have ever used in my life! I use it everyday in the shower!"
2,Could have been funnier,I wasn't too impressed with this collection. It was bearable for one car ride and now it's been re-gifted to someone else.
1,S'il vous plait- save your money! Merci,"Well, I just have one word for this film-boring. Some of the scenery is good, but that's about it. So, save your money, go rent something else."
5,Wonderful Scholarship!,"Martin Grams once again demonstrates that he is one of our leading scholars of vintage radio drama. The Sound of Detection is THE total source-book on all-things radio related to Ellery Queen. If you are a mystery fan, an old time radio fan, or just interested in how a literary propety transfers into another medium, this is the book for you. Bravo, Mr. Grams!"
4,VOYAGE TO GREAT DETECTION,The booki is full of information and great reading experience. I give it only 4 stars because of the lack of photos to make this volume even better. BUY IT!
5,"Fabulous ""float away"" music",I use music to change my mood from stressed and overworked to carefree. This album is ideal for that. Plus I love the creativity of the artist.
4,still has an important message about war,"The lead story was ok, but I especially liked the ""RED LAUGH"", and the strong antiwar message. Not much has changed in 100 years."
4,TNA Sacrifice 2010 review,"The 3 way tag bout(Team 3-D vs. Beer Money Inc. vs the Motor City Machine Guns) was a pretty good/solid 3 way. The TNA Global title match between Rob Terry & Olando Jordan was a dull & dry match. The X-Divsion title match between Kazarian & Doug Willams was a high-flying,hard-hitting showstealer. The TNA Women's title match between Madison Rayne & Tara was a solid/back-and-forth bout and the same goes for the Jeff Hardy-Mr.Anderson match. The TNA World tag team title match between Ink Inc(Jesse Neal & Shannon Moore) & The Band(Kevin Nash & Scott Hall) while having some flaws,it was still a good match. The Aybss-Desmond Wolfe match while goofy at some points,it was still a solid bout. The Jeff Jarrett-Sting match was a 14 second stink-fest. The TNA World title match between RVD & AJ Styles was a heart-stopping,nail biting,high-flying match of the year candidate. I give this PPV a 8 out of 10."
4,A good Claudia book...,"This was a pretty good book about how Claudia dealt with reality and trying to get all her friends to mingle. She did it pretty successfully, but she almost got into big trouble, due to a few mistakes. I won't reveal them here; read it and see!All in all - a pretty good read, although this book could be longer..."
4,no.1_book_lover,"I loved the book! It's just as good as all the other Babysitters Club books. It's got new storylines too. I won't spiol the fun, read it for yourself."
1,Great idea but poor performance !!,"As binoculars, it focuses fine but the only way it would ever be comfortable to hold to your face is if you had No nose! Handling is very awkward and your nose gets in the way because of the way the camera is positioned in the center of the binoculars. As a camera, it's not!! Your pictures do NOT focus in on what you are seeing through the binoculars. It produces blurry pictures no matter what the distance. It also does not auto-balance the light, your pictures will also have unnatural shadowing unless you are in very bright sunlight. The enclosed instructions are also very little help in picture taking and troubleshooting..."
2,Poor Performance !!,"This works great indeed if you didn't have a nose. Pics are blurry unless U have VERY bright sunlight, otherwise..dont' take pics. Not what I expected.Would not recommend."
3,Only for begginner sysadmins !,"For a begginner-to-intermediate sysadmin this book is a valuable resource, but for the professional already administering hunderds or thousands of servers it is of no real use."
1,Do Not buy this book.,If you want to read this book or any other from this author just buy Troubleshooting and Servicing Modern AC and Refrigeration systems all ESCO press did was reprint the same info word for word from the above mentioned book and put into three other books by the same author. I bought three other books by this suthor and its the same book.
2,could have been better,"the worst thing about this book is it went into detail on the wrong things.. i.e. liquid amplification, etc.for 20 bucks it's okay.. but the author is supposed to be well known in the refrigeration field and the title of the book was on refrigeration and charging and should have stuck to a solid foundation on how refrigeration works and how to charge.. in depth that would have given valuable information.. subjects that should have been covered in depth are airflow, humidity, heat load, etc.. how pressures and temperatures move heat and how to accurately measure when a unit is properly charged and what affects making that determination, i.e. heat load etc.. all in all like i said 20 bucks is not much to spend and it mostly gives you that in value.. so it wasn't money wasted.. it just could have been a better book.."
1,Stripped down Troubleshooting and Servicing Modern Air Conditioning and Refrigeration Systems,"This is a subset of Tomczyk's other book for Esco.This booklet is some chapters from ""Troubleshooting and Servicing Modern Air Conditioning and Refrigeration Systems"".Cheaper to buy the full thing. Smarter to buy something else entirely."
2,outdated,"The book has some useful information in it but it is outdated not organized well. Ironically, the cover shows a picture of refrigerant 410a and gauges for 410a but the book does not cover 410a and has zero charts for 410a. I recommend buying a different book."
4,Good for group study,"In the past I have read the full devotional version of this book and like it a little bit better. I am using this version as a group study for a Sunday School class, so for that reason I like the workbook because we are able to write in it, however I miss the two additional days that have been left out. I have been typing out the things that Day 5 requests we pray for from the original book to give to my class. I felt that the last two days from the devotional had so much to offer."
3,surprised,I was very surprised is the nicest way to say it. I got it for my mom as a Christmas present and she opens it and the first two lessons were already done...
5,Woman of the Bible.,A purchase for my Daughter and she was delighted that it was received the same day of the order. One could not ask for better service.
3,Sifting Through,"Syswerda's ""Women of the Bible"" is stronger on ""what would you do if"" and ""what do you think her feelings were"", and weaker on God's activity in the woman's life and solid Biblical lessons to be learned. A huge number of women are included, and if you sift through, some useful information and discussion starters are to be found. I would use it in conjunction with a more God-focused study guide."
3,Good Women in the Bible workbook.,"This workbook is good for a suppliment to the BOOK, Women in the Bible. I was wanting the BOOK, not the workbook. I even looked at the table of contents to verify it was the same as the one I needed. Well of course they matched. I didn't understand this was a softsided workbook not the main book that has additional informational insite to the stories covered. Ultimately the $15+ I spent wasn't really a good buy without the actual BOOK to go with my new WorkBook. I would have boughten both if I had known there were two pieces to the study material. Thanks, SP"
4,Love the book,This item came very quickly. I have had no problems with it. Nothing was damaged and it still works. I am happy with this product!
4,Women of the Bible,"After personally using the companion devotional book last year, I recommended that our ladies' Sunday School class try this workbook in between other studies. Since each week focuses on a different woman, we can easily continue later with the following chapter. So far, the response has been excellent. The questions provoke personal comments from the whole group, although occassionally I find the queries to be oversimplified. The accompanying history and scriptures show that much study went into this book.There is no ""leader's guide"" for reference, which encourages me to look at other resources as well. The section in the devotional book, which I really liked: ""Her Sorrow & Her Joy"" is not included in this workbook. The novelized version of each woman's story is also only in the devotional, which is fine, since we don't use that in our group."
2,No new material,"This workbook was designed to be used in place of, not in addition to, the ""Women of the Bible"" book by Ann Spangler & Jean Syswerda. The ""Women of the Bible"" book contains five devotions for each week. This workbook contains the first three days devotional for each week (the exact same material that's in the ""Women of the Bible"" book)."
4,women's review,This is a great book for my Sunday School class and alsosmall study groups. Time for study is not too lengthyand discussion needs about 45 minutes.
3,Takes forever to get through!,"Some of the women are so obscure that it seems like the author is really reaching to get enough information to make a study. Our group found that some of the study questions required little to no thought at all which didn't help to get the discussion going. The real reason this book only gets 3 stars is because, if you meet once a week, it takes an entire year to finish!"
1,why ?,"this book is for feminists and catholics.Christians should be studying Christ.studying women of the Bible is a waste of time that could be better used.There are important issues in the Bible that need study, butthis book is not focused on those."
5,Ingenious!,"Great invention. We use this on our common first floor bathroom. Would love to have one in every bathroom. It doesn't overpower the room with a heavy scent, works very quietly, cleans up easily. I highly recommend."
4,Works quite well!,"My wife was dubious about this product, but I got one at Amazon anyway, and it turns out to work so well that we ordered another one from another company on the web, who proceeded to ship us a Breeza Warm instead (for the price of a Breeza). Other than the cord, we like the Breeza Warm even better, though probably not for the extra money.We power our Breeza with Sanyo Eneloop AA batteries with D-cell converters. Have had it for a month, and haven't had to change/recharge the batteries yet."
2,"Too vague, could not understand any of her patterns",I was very disappointed in this book. This is more of an autobiography than a knitting book and the one pattern I would have loved I could not follow for love nor money.I would not recommend for the average knitter like me and would only think that very experienced knitters could enjoy this book.If your interested in the life of Elizabeth then this is a lovely book.
2,Underwhelming,"I was quite unimpressed with this book. The look is very old fashioned and dated, and the garments pictured are lifeless and dull looking. Not an inspiring book at all, even if she is a knitting guru!"
2,Not as good as expected,"The instructions are fine for knitting sweaters without seams, but the chattiness and stories make it hard to find the useful bits."
1,Disappointed,"I did not realize that this book had been published so long ago. I was disappointed by the patterns, illustrations, and was not very interested in knowing Zimmermann's life story."
4,Mainly for EZ devotees,"This book contains many patterns that I don't have in other EZ books. About half the contents, though, are EZ's autobiography. There are EZ-style patterns for: moccasin socks (re-footable socks), fairisle yoke pullover, dickeys & hats, mobius, bog jacket, pi shawl, norwegian pullover, various mittens and an aran coat. While I have the pullovers and some (not all) mittens in other EZ books, I have no other copies of the remaining garments.The patterns are generally presented in EZ's conversational style not in the detailed style preferred by some folks."
5,This was a gift,"This was a gift for a seasoned knitter. She had requested it; so, I am certain that it was well reviewed in advance."
5,Good reading,"Not only do you get Elizabeth's innovative patterns and ideas but this makes for good bedtime reading with her ""Diversions"". Loved it."
2,sweaters,"This book was not at all like I expected. First of all....most of the book is stories about Elizabeth. I was wanting more information about seamless sweater design and instruction. If you want to know more about Elizabeths personal history then this book is for you. If you need instructions for sweaters, I would suggest Knitting without Tears or Knitting workshop. I am re saling my book."
4,"A strange episode, thats for sure.","I wouldn't call this the best episode ever...but a good one if Troi is your favorite actor. It starts off rather abrubt, but I liked it overall."
1,Arrogant Biographer,"I liked other works by James Atlas and so ran out and bought this book as soon as it came out. I was so disappointed, since Atlas writes with a subtext of superiority--amend that: sometimes his competitive streak IS the text. Nothing I say can hold a candle to Lee Seigel's great review in The New Republic where he shows, and I agree, that Atlas--straight-laced member of the Ambitious Generation is doing a hatchet job on the masters of yore, in this case Bellow. Do not buy this book if you are a Bellow Lover."
1,The Biographer as Parasite,"This is not a biography, it is a way for the author to advance his own career, using Saul Bellow, a really distiinguished novelist, as a stepping stone. Why would you pick a subject to write about if you disapprove of him? Yet every page of this book reeks with the author's smug sanctimonious alleged superiority (morally?) Very bogus!"
2,bla bla bla,"For some reason many of the authors we read are very interesting people, more interesting then the books they write. Dickens and Hemingway to name just a few. In this case Bellow's books are way more interesting then his bio. There could of been a lot more about his books and a lot less of the author tip toeing around what a terrible selfish egotistcal and boring person Saul Bellow is. That he pretty much used relationships to get writing material and feed that ego. Any way read his books, Bellow is a great writer, I think, and wait for Bellow to pass on to his just reward. Hopefuly someone then will write a good Bio."
4,Four Stars,"I have all of his CDs, so obviously I'm a fan. My opinion is: I like it. Three of the songs -- San Marco Moderna, Red Moon and Tempest -- will be added to my 'Best Of' playlist immediately. He continues to discover unique new lines and syncopations that blow me away, but like I said, I'm a fan. The CD has 4 or 5 songs that I would call very good and the rest are certainly listenable. I'll take that ratio in a release from any artist. Much better than Flesh on Flesh, which I'd give 2 1/2 stars. I'd say its the best since Orange and Blue, which has been my favorite."
5,Triumphant return to electric guitar!,Al Di Meola is back with his Electric guitar. The whole CD is great especially tracks 10 thru 14. Thank you Al for bringing back your electric sound. These is the CD that all Al Di Meola fans will love. Great job!
5,Great jazz-rock fusion,"It is pretty neat to see a musician who, after releasing many albums, produces something that may be his very best, and this after a long career of magnificent music. I wish he had more imitators. This album is so rich that it takes months to explore all of its facets."
2,"Far, far from his best","Sorry to disappoint...I AM a big Al DiMeola fan, and I did not like this CD. If you want to describe it with a few words, there is no music in it - yes there are few (well, lots) fast passages on the guitar, lots of which you normally find in studies written for students to practice your fingerings, but all in all it sound to me like very, very unnaturally assembled bits and pieces that form an amalgam of no music. It is like if you get 10 - 20 studies for a guitar, cut random pieces of them and then randomly assemble them - the chance you get similar music are very high.I have listened to much, much better pieces of music from Al DiMeola from his earlier recordings. Very few pieces from this CD are worth listening to them."
4,"good, but could be better","I recommend reading the installation instructions on the daproducts.com web before buying this. Installing takes some time and careful handling. Once you get it on, the Da Products protector is much clearer, sturdier, and easier to clean than the vinyl sticker screen protectors. This protector is fairly thick with vertical edges that extended about 2mm above the face of my Canon SD450. The protector would be more attractive if the edges were rounded or beveled."
5,A must have,I bought this product after i repair my broken LCD of my cannon sd550 and i must said it's just great and the only think that i regret its the fact that i didn't buy it with my camera.
4,Decent Clear and Stylish,"Well, I have had a lot of speakers. These speakers as far as design goes are a 5 but if you like really deep bass they aren't the ones to go with. For Jazz or classical music they are super clean. My rap cd's sound weak on the bass end. I was thinking about returning them but man they match my office perfect and sound clean clean clean."
1,These speakers often have a grounding problem,After trying to fix a constant hum. Ive realized that many other people have also had problems with the same hum. After connecting them to my cd/diskman and the sound pursist. I am certain that the speakers are defective.
1,Sounded Great when they worked. Don't work anymore,"Acquired these with my Dell computer 2 years ago. Speakers had very impressive sound quality. Thoroughly enjoyed them. But now the subwoofer makes a horribly distorted deep bass sound that overpowers all other sound. It's so bad the speakers must be turned off. This speaker set is too expensive to have such a rotton service life. Speakers should last a lifetime. I see from other reviews that other people have experienced the same failure I have, even sooner. I hope the problem is reparable."
1,"Bought Them 14 Months Ago, And I'm Shopping For New Ones","I'm part of the group that has had no luck with these. They worked in the beginning...then something fried inside the sub...returned them, got new ones...Same thing happened...now they are unuseable. They start to go when you hear the light crackling...then it moves into the bass distortion mode...now they just hum loudly with intermitent loud crackling. I'm now shopping for new speaker and when I saw that they were still available I just wanted to see what other folks were saying about them...WOW, I'm not alone! They look cool but they have a quality issue for sure...hit or miss I guess, a gamble for sure!"
2,"Looks great, sounds great but lacking durability","Like many others, I ordered these speakers with my new Dell. They look great with the PC and I was very pleased with the sound...that was for about 9 months. I don't think I 'overworked' these speakers but the left speaker is blown. It hisses with most songs but oddly goes away sometimes.The other (smaller) annoyance is that it's fairly easy to knock the speakers over. They are front-heavy. They need more weight on the back of the base."
2,"Great Looks, power not as great.","This speaker system has great looks, and great high sounds, but does not have any power in the lower bass sounds and a very weak mid-range sound. It does not live up to what I thought the system could be when I purchased it. I am pretty disapointed with the system, and am already looking at a 4.1 system by Klipsch, I listened to it in the store, what a great system!! Much more power than this one. (But 5 times the cost!) This system has great looks, too bad the power could not be as great."
1,Good Sound... For Three Months,The sound was very good when I got these speakers and were for about three months. Then the bass started creating a horrbile muffling sound that would sometimes go away for a bit if you hit (I'm not making this up) the top of the speaker in just the right way. Nine months later the speakers just stopped working. Do NOT get these speakers.
2,Adventurous unique buddy book,"Very imaginative, very creative. But there's definitely a young male adult audience feel to the thing. Which is fine if you like that thing, which I don't. I kept waiting for the big lesson in there, or some big meaningful connection between the stories. The second one where they climb mount everest was my favorite. The last two were my least favorite. They got too weird and dark and I've no idea where the author was going with them.I read this on vacation. I don't think I would have finished it half-way through the Shambhala story otherwise. It would be a good idea for a TV movie for young adults."
4,a little light reading,"This is Nepal as it was in the 80's A throwaway novel, when compared to his masterworks like the Mars Trilogy, this entertaining read is highly recommended for anyone who has trekked [or dreams of trekking] in Nepal. He evokes the Kathmandu of the late 70s and 80s perfectly - from named restaurants and hippie highpoints to the bustle, muck and medieval layers of Kathmandu and its environs. Descriptions of the town and trekking the nearby mountains ring true, although the plot itself is too thin to support much examination. It's a fun book, in the style of The Ascent of Rum Doodle."
3,Cheech & Chong & the Temple of Doom,"I have offered an alternate title for Kim Stanley Robinson's Escape from Kathmandu. As all us hard sci-fi fans know, KSR is a serious writer, the James A. Michener of sci-fi, even. Now we know what he does for fun. I had a marvelous time with this book, laughing out loud upon occasion. I think I may have gone to college with the 2 expatriate heroes, but like them, I have some brain damage and cannot recall. Whether you are a die-hard KSR fan or in need of a good beach book, this one has it all: Wonderful characters, cliff-hanger plotlines, humor and (gasp!) redeeming social value. Read and have a blast."
5,Very good item for the price,This life vest is pretty comfortable and also looks pretty nice. Used this today for the first time and am pretty impressed. Very much worth the money.
5,A pocketful of convenience,"There is a lot to praise in this little pocketful. Setting it up is a breeze, even with the terse documentation provided, and I got started using it within 10 minutes. Read and data transfer rates are good enough for home or amateur, even office use, though a multimedia professional may want quicker times. The small footprint means you can easily fit it on crowded desks and carrying it around is easy too. And carry it you will - the reason for buying this gadget of course is to ease the load on your digital camera. Using the camera to transfer images to a computer is a waste of battery time and even if you use the adaptor, you really don't need the camera's electronics to run the transfer. Instead, leave the camera in its case, slip the card into this reader and you are on your way. A small precaution: As with all USB devices, this reader draws power from the computer so before you unplug, check that no read/write operation is under way or you may lose data."
2,"Out of Date, look for newer version","This book provided good information, but too many laws have changed concerning personal finance and debt problems. Look for the 2008 version of this book and other good books from nolo and other sources on debt, money troubles, personal finances, consumer law, etc."
5,Outstanding but don't fudge on your measurements...,"Miracle Suits and Shapewear, do everything they can to make you look 10,20 to 30 pounds less. I have been a big fan for over 10 years.One catch though, they are exacting in size. Meaning you will have to buy a bigger size then your use to. If you have a 36 inch waist, you will need to buy the XL or 2XL check the charts."
3,black and tight!!,"I got the large and removed the tag,so I can't exchange now..in the future I will go to the store and try them on at the mall..this will fit me when I get smaller so,I will use it than..now is to tight and it does suck in my tummy but,my thighs look big since,it makes them hang out like they have whole new world lol..if your around 160 lbs I say get the XL just to be safe..I am around now that weight range and wear a large so,I guess is not the same for damm shapewear..last and first time I order damm clothes online.that includes shapewear...the size chart is way off..my waist is 32 and my thighs are 45 so that shows you NOT ALL CHARTS are for REAL WOMEN..just for school girls on crack."
2,Not a proper gift,"I am a Final Fantasy fan, and want to buy a related gift to my girl friend. From the picture, this necklace looks good and it is not expensive, so I ordered it. However, the actual item looks very poor. The blue gem is made by some cheap transparent plastic. There are even some obvious flaws on it. I never expect something with high value for this price, but at least it should have a fine appearance. If you want to buy a serious gift, do NOT buy it; If you want to wear something related to Final Fantasy, you should think twice for this one. Well, I doubt I will ever wear it."
2,It Nice but it not from FF X,It a nice Necklace but the box says it from FF7 Advent Children not FF 10 like it says on the name here.
2,chain was broken,the chain of the necklace was broken and had to be replaced with a connector. Probably because of the delicate metal. Caution before buying.
1,Weak.,It broke on the third day. It broke to the point it can not be fixed or switch chains. The fake crystal looks cool.
5,Thorough Confidence Building Book,These two books were very well written and really ensure that you'll know what you need to to pass the exams. I bought the book by Michael Meyers and I was just very disappointed with it. I'm very glad I got these books. They are used by many schools to teach and you just can't go wrong with them.
5,excellent,One of the most through books on the subject. Gives all the need to know information in an easy to follow format. The test that comes with it on the enlosed CD is very real life and should put people more at ease about the actually certification test. Would reccomend itto anyone looking for a study guide for the A+ certification test
5,Wow! This Series Got Me Through the Exam,"I have nothing but praise for Certification Insider and this Exam Prep/Cram in particular. The information was quite thorough and yet easy to understand. I felt quite prepared to take both the Core and Windows exam. The ""study alerts"" and ""tips"" were extraordinarily helpful and I passed both exams in the FIRST TRY!"
1,Sophomoric,"The book's premise, in the hands of an expert writer, might have played out as a decent thriller. But handicapped by Meltzer's sophomoric, borderline 7th grade prose, his latest rambling, semi-coherent, ambiguously convoluted ""novel"" fails to engage.In giving credit where it is due, the singular accomplishment that I would begrudgingly confer upon Meltzer is his somewhat realistic dialog. Whereas some novelists construct stilted, obviously manufactured conversations, Meltzer's banter rings strangely true.However, even this comes at a price. The reader is bombarded with a barrage of sniveling, whining, pseudo-sarcastic repartee that constitutes over 50% of the book. So even though there is a tinge of verisimilitude to the dialog, it gets old rather quickly."
4,Brad surprised me again,"This book is another nail biter. I love books about the government, and Brad never fails me. His books are each from a different viewpoint, and they are all entertaining.This book had so many turns I couldn't keep them all straight. But I loved it.The characters I think are well rounded, and one can definitely gather their background even if it isn't listed.The setting descriptions are well planned, and aren't as boring as I usually think.If you want a book where you think you know the answer, but you want to be wrong because it's written well enough to fool you, this one's the deal."
3,Interesting,"This is an interesting political thriller with good and bad sides. Although it starts off quite promising it does ""slow"" down and looses its uniqueness.Having said that, it does not mean that this book has no merit. The characters are well developed, it is well writen and it flows. All in all an intersting read."
3,"Shameless Da Vinci/Masonic link, but decent book","I like Meltzer's books and I was really looking forward to this one. Especially with the idea based around a Masonic/Da Vinci theme. But....the Masons basically make a cameo appearance.I might have given the book 4 stars had it not been for the misleading *suggestions* that this would be another book along the lines of the Da Vinci code, etc.Overall not a bad book, just don't expect the Masons to play a leading role..."
3,Bait and Switch - But not (totally) bad,"I bought this book because I thought there would be Masonic stuff in it, secret codes, the usual Dan Brown stuff. Not much of that here.Wasn't a total waste of time though.Good points:I didn't see some of the plot twists coming.Meltzer, being a local, gets the local topography correct. Nice to see that attention to detail.I like plus-size redheads.I liked the combination of Wes' first-person point-of-view and the rest of the book being in the third person.Lots of behind-the-scenes details.Bad points:Too much ""Poor Wes"" stuff. His friends are obnoxious. Nico requires too much suspension of disbelief. Lots of disconnected plot points, most noticably the alleged Masonic stuff.Everyone says his earlier books are better. Will have to read those now, and imagine what this book could have been."
3,"A Little Bit ""Out There"".","This is my first Meltzer novel. While it moved pretty quickly, it was still about 100 pages too long by my estimation. The novel centers around Wes Holloway, a Presidential aide who was disfigured in an assassination attempt that killed another aide to the President. After eight years, Wes' spots the victim and begins to try to uncover the mystery surrounding that day. What he finds is a government conspiracy, deceit and a cover-up."
2,The Book of Fate,"This was the first time that I read this author. I was intrigued with the Masonic reference and was extremely disappointed in the scarity of masonic references. I also felt the book started slowly and gradually gained speed, but by that time, I just wanted to finish. In fact, I almost put it down mid-way."
4,Very Good- New Author for me,Saw the author's History Channel program by chance anf enjoyed the program and purchased this book for my Kindle Fire. Read and enjoyed the book and will read more of Meltzer's books. This was an intiqueing story based on free masonry of which I have always had some interest in. My father and several family members have been Mason's and since it was so secretive my childhood interest has survived to my old age!Whether the story is true or fiction it is a good read and strongly reccomender for anyone who likes mystery or spy stories.Enjoy.
1,Idiotic and Juvenile,"I decided to read this book based on the fact that I mildly enjoy Brad Meltzer's TV show. Like my title for this review says, the book is idiotic and juvenile. It is literally like a college kid writing a terrible political conspiracy book aimed at 8th graders. The plot sucked. The characters are crap. We have to suffer through every character having some dumb named like ""Rogo"" or ""Dreidel"". This book was the lamest thing I've read in YEARS. As far as I can tell, Meltzer has zero talent as a writer."
4,Great service,"Great book, excellent service, thanks for a wonderful transaction. Book is in first rate condition, the Wife loves it. Thanks."
1,Awful!,"Reading this book was like listening to nails dragged across a chalkboard. It was so bad I cringed. Meltzer has created the wimpiest protagonist imaginable. You just want to punch this character in the face and scream, ""Man up!"" The plot itself is hardly ""thrilling,"" but its banality is far surpassed by the grating dialogue -- complete with pointless character bickering, constant interruptions, and repeated statements of the obvious -- and enough adverbs and adjectives to make Mark Twain roll over in his grave. I can't believe how bad this book was. One star is being kind."
2,The Book of Fate,"Mr. Meltzer did not put his best foot forward with this book. Some things were stretched way beyond anything believable when it came to time and ability to accomplish tasks. In the beginning, I felt sorry for Wes but as time played out I was sick of his incessant whining about his disfiguring injury. The continued focus on his injury was almost an insult to Mr. Meltzer's readers, as though they would forget how this injury had ""handicapped"" or diminished Wes. I also found myself wishing that Mr. Meltzer had fleshed out some of the other characters a bit more so the reader could understand what was driving them to engage in certain behaviors. On its own, The Book of Fate was somewhat disappointing; however, as the precursor to The Inner Circle, it was helpful in establishing some background."
2,Great for a Plane,"I was expecting so much more from the jacket copy. That should teach me. The book was really just a ho-hum conspiracy book that's great for a plane ride when you don't have to concentrate and if you leave it behind, you're not broken up."
2,Wrong order,"All of my orders are for Kindle. This one was sent in ""pocket book"" form. I have Macular Degeneration and small print is difficult for me. That was my major reason originally, for buying a Kindle. I also have a problem with another book. I would like to review Diagnosis Death by Richard Mabry, MD. I ordered the entire book after reading the example. I was charged for it but never received the full book."
2,The Da Vinci Code with the Flu,"Having read Identity Crisis and appreciating the close attention to detail that Brad Meltzer spent on that book, I was very disappointed by The Book of Fate.The style and plot line reminded me too much of The Da Vinci Code, except the story was weaker and the characters were not developed at all. Even the title itself seems inappropriately named, as the plot focused more on the boring cat and mouse chase between the Three and the book's protagonist.Overall, I expect great things for Meltzer and look forward to his future works, but this book was not worth the time or money I spent."
2,Pass,"I hated how the author would start a sentence and then all of the sudden -From the descriptions this sounded like a very good book, but after 100 pages I can't take Wes anymore.Well, on to the next -"
2,Done with Brad Meltzer,"After The Zero Game and The Millionaires, I thought I would give Brad Meltzer one more shot. He blew it.Everything has to have a twist in his books. Backstabbing out of nowhere with no foreshadowing, unbelievable and ridiculous plotlines, and useless characters haunt everything he writes.Political/action/adventure thrillers have enough quality writers, I am glad I didn't waste any money on this book. Thank you soldiers for leaving behind paperback novels all over the place in Baghdad!"
2,Long and lacks credibility,This is based on the Unabridged audio book.This book has little to do with the free masons. That is just one of many disappointments.My second problem was the way the author dragged the story out. This would have made an OK story at two thirds the length. Much of the filler was spent over dramatizing the anguish of the main character. If I was actually reading the book I would have skimmed over those parts. That is hard with CDs. The reader added to the problem by over acting these parts.The ending was preposterous. I suspect the author thought he was being creative by coming out of left field with the unveiling of the secret. The main reason I did not think of this option is because it made no sense.
2,Not very good.,"The publisher's description of the book leads you to believe that this is another book about the Freemasons. While exciting in premise, it fell far short of delivering on it's promises. The plot gets jumbled at times, and the book was longer than it should have been.The one thing of note however was the character development. You see several, flawed characters go through things that change them along the way. Something that is always great to see that is done in so few novels of this genre."
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME,"I hardly have enough time to write a review let alone read a 500-page book. However, I needed an escape so I picked this one up on someone saying it has sold a lot of copies and was in the DaVinci Code family. Last time I ever listen to him. (I should have read the online reviews first.) This is nothing but a sophomoric dime novel wrapped in a title to allure in readers. The book is filled with fluff that is neither well written nor compelling. I was really hoping for some kind of twist at the end. It is repetitive and stale. Perhaps this is my angst being vocalized but I just wasted an enormous amount of time. Even if I put in the spoiler for the story and you still read it, you would look back and say it did not matter. But you should know...it has next to nothing to do with the Free Masons or The Book of Fate. First time and last time I ever read this author. To the author: Be Honest! This is the perfect example that ""You can not read a book by its cover."" Arghhhhh!"
3,Average Read- Deceiving Description on Book Flap and Title,"I have only read the Zero Game by Meltzer and found that to be a pretty good read; however, The Book Of Fate was a disappointment. I was excited to see that this book contained historical references and such, but found them to be miniscule at best. Not to mention the entire book was sort of bizarre after an intriguing beginning. I probably would recommend this book to bought in paperback."
1,Waste of Time and Money,Previous Meltzer books were good reads. This one sucks. Don't waste your money buying a book that has no business anywhere near the bestsellers list. Even one of those formulaic books from Patterson and whoever would be a better use of your time and money.
2,Confusion in the highest office,"Wow! I was so happy to get to the end of this very confusingbook. There are no heros, no one that you can relate to. The main character is a shaking, sweating mess of a man that you can not idenify with at all. There are so many sub plots that you need to keep notes. I hope he goes back to the style I am usedto."
5,A Road We Do Not Know,"This book is an excellent history of General Custer's command of the 7th Calvary and the Indian tribes engaged in the battle of the Little Big Horn, the most famous and controversial events in American History. I highly recommend this book for any American History buff."
5,Meltzer's best yet,"I've read all but his first two novels. This one is the most fun. I felt more tension and more compassion, too. And it has a happy ending. The Mason's thing is played up in the marketing but the plot would just fine without it. His publisher must have decided to play up the Masons to sell more books, what with the success of the Da Vinci Code and all."
3,Meltzer is good...,"...and doesn't make the characters SO unbelievable as to ruin the book. Attention to detail is always good, and the story keeps you invested."
1,A bait and switch job.,"IF there was any significant mention/reference to Thomas Jefferson and or the FreeMason conspiracy, maybe I missed it as I nodded off during this too long, weak plot waste of good forest product. Skip this at all costs and pray they don't make it into a TV movie. The book description leads one to believe there might be a story here, there isn't. A Total waste of time!"
4,A solid first impression of Brad Meltzer,"This is my first reading of a Brad Meltzer novel, and I can say that I enjoyed my read of ""The Book of Fate"". Based in what I would describe as a ""National Treasure/Da Vinci Code"" Lite, you follow the store of Wes, and aide for former President Manning. From an attempted assination attempt on President Manning's life, to befriend a gossip collumist, to lies and betrayls on many different levels, Book of Fate was a solid read. I did find the continous back-and-forth from one part of the story to another a little on the annoying side; a chapter can last 2 pages, then the very next chapter dealing with a different part of the story last 4 pages, then reverts back to the first part for another 3 pages; the book was still a good read. I look forward to reading more by this author."
1,Self-pity,"I should have written this review right after I finished listening to the book on audio. I waited in vain for the promised mysteries of Free Masonry which the author hints at in his preface. Alas, it was all in the preface... As it turns out, The Book of Fate is a rather bland, uninspired story with a bunch of unlikable characters, which didn't help. The main protagonist, in particular, had the unfortunate and major flaw of wallowing in buckets of self-pity from beginning to end... Not recommended."
4,A Political Thriller,"Meltzer takes the symbols and codes of the past and their meaning to show us how they can be twisted to justify a religious fanatic's murderous deeds. Manipulated by men in positions of government power, the assassin kills and manes the people he is told are evil and doing the work of the devil. Greed being the basis for this manipulation, the plot continues even after the assassin is caught.Meltzer gives us an insightful story that seamlessly interjects historical facts with possible ill-gotten government deeds of the present. A very well written political thriller"
2,Skip this one,"Decently written, but this book had so many holes I can't even cover them all. If you're looking for a Dan Brown-ish puzzle (which is what the cover makes it sound like), you'll be very disappointed. The actual ""book"" is only referenced by the crazy guy and never even explained. That being said, the plot is paced well and keeps you reading. There are just so many good books out there, than an average one like this should be skipped altogether."
3,Solid Read With A Misleading Title,"A secret service agent,Wes Halloway, was shot in the face during what looked like an attempt to assassinate the president. Wes survived, but another agent, Boyle, was killed. Eight years later, Wes is still a secret service agent for the now former president and literally runs into a living agent Boyle. After years of blaming himself for the Boyle's death, Wes will do anything to unravel what really went on the day of the shooting, even if it endangers his life and others.A well-written mystery, it was interesting watching the puzzles come together. Although I think the title is a little misleading; the Book of Fate is only mentioned about twice, and I thought there was going to be maybe a little something paranormal about the book. Turns out there is no real Book of Fate. It's just something a crazy person mentions. So I was a little bit of disappointed, but it was a somewhat entertaining book."
3,Book of Fate,The book was a three star for me.....because I wanted to finish it. There were some holes in the plot but it isn't as bad as all the poor reviews make it out to be. I did figure out some of the mysteries which was good for me. The ending seems a bit rushed but okay and could have been better.
2,Misleading Title,"Unfortunately I felt this book to be tedious and rather pretentious. I wanted to like it and kept hoping it would pick up momentum,but it really never did. It needed tightening up and the title truly is misleading. I was very disappointed."
1,MISLEADING PROMO X 2,"I don't think I have ever read a book with a more misleadingtitle and promotion!The ""Book of Fate"" title has nothing to do with the story - It is mentioned in a confusing way but it doesn't tie in to the plot.The Masonic angle - I'm not sure why it was brought in at all! It had nothingto do with the story. I can't believe he did research and then used so little of it in this book. It was more of a marketing ploy - I guessit worked this time-however I don't think I will risk wasting my time on any of his other books - ever."
1,Awful,"It took me 3 weeks of 'pick it up for an hour, put it down for three days' to plow through this book. The only reason I finished it is that I have a compulsion for finishing anything (books, movies, tasks) that I start. This one was absolutely painful at times. The plot bounced around with no cohesion, the storyline was full of holes and was, frankly, beyond unbelievable, the characters were either weak, pathetic, unlikable or all three, and the interweaving of the Mason angle was absolutely idiotic. There is no way I would recommend that anyone waste irretrievable hours of their life reading this book. Sorry Brad, I liked your other books. Hope you can return to form."
2,Agree with many other reviewers!,"I'm sorry to say that I agree with many other reviewers so far. I have really enjoyed Meltzer's other books, but this one was just too much. I would have let him get away with some of the typical complaints (whiny main character, etc) but it was just so long (qty of pages). I pick up a book like this for entertainment value (I know it's not going to win any awards) but I really just stopped being entertained and wanted to know ""what's the point"" after a while. And that conversation in the final chapter/epilogue with the ""whose getting nooky"" convo between Wes and Rogo was just bizarre."
1,"An unabashed Meltzer fan, thoroughly disappointed.","In this book I felt as though Meltzer relied too heavily on the mystique surrounding characters that hold positions of high esteem within the book world. In his previous novels like 'The First Counsel' and 'The Tenth Justice' he used characters who occupied very prestigious positions in Washington to spin exceptionally entertaining tales. This time around the main character is a hollow shell of his predecessors and the fact that he is connected to an ex-President of the United States does nothing at all to make him appealing. Possibly noone was there to tell Meltzer 'No!' this time around and the result was a book I put down for good after a very tedious 150 pages. Pick it up Brad, I actually bought this book so next time around you owe me buddy."
2,Two Stars Only Because I'm A Brad Meltzer Fan,"I've enjoyed Brad Meltzer's other books so much that I TRIED to like THE BOOK OF FATE but just couldn't. I was so excited because it was long and I felt I'd be engrossed in this hard-to-put down thriller. On the contrary, I finally just gave up trying to follow the plot and returned the book to the library. I would have been mad if I had bought this book. However, I still look forward to Brad's next offering because he is an outstanding writer capable of producing another real page-turner."
1,I wanted to enjoy this book,"But I didn't.In fact I disliked it intensely.The premise sounded interesting and Mr. Meltzer is known for his stories of political intrique. But the plot was lost in a maze of ""facts"" about the Masons (which had nothing to do with the story), adjectives too numerous to stomach(5 adjectives for every noun- when 3 would have been too many), adverbs and metaphors not only too numerous, but thrown in for the most inconsequential portions of the narrative.I won't be reading Mr. Meltzer again."
3,Not typical Brad Meltzer,I normally love Meltzer's novels and can't wait to buy the next one but this one was just OK. I will probably still buy his next one because the previous ones have been so great.
5,Its difinitly Fate with me its awsome,Brad Meltzer in away like himingway in his writing that u feel the reality of the breath the walk his ability of writing is totally briliant.
2,Glad I only paid a buck for this at a garage sale.,"Ordinarily, I enjoy suspending disbelief for the sake of diversion when I read these thrillers, but for the most part it wasn't worth it. There was a lot of inane details that ultimately didn't mean much and, as a previous reviewer mentioned, the use of cryptologic references that alluded to Jefferson and the Masons was really just a cheap trick that led nowhere. This was my first Meltzer, and I sure hope that his other stuff is better. Of course, my appreciation of it may have been negatively influenced because it was sandwiched by 1776 and the World is Flat."
3,"Misleading title, good book.","The masonic stuff consists of brief delusional side thoughts of one character of many. AND that is nothing you haven't heard in the first five minutes of any entertainment/documentary show about the Masons. What's good is the convincing detail about the world of a US prez and ex-prez and the support staff. Meltzer is a writer who cares about the craft of writing. I hate to knock other writers but if you've read some of the other best selling authors and you care about good writing, the experience is grating. Not so with Meltzer. Great writing, not hack stuff. Even the main character is not your normal stock character. I feel the author succeeds at being good and original on many points. I don't know why it was sold the way it was."
4,great book,Great book with a good story line and able to keep the reader interested.I highly recommend this book like every other book form this author
3,Book of Fate,"It is slow in places. I could have quit after only a couple of chapters. At that point, the narrative gave me no reason in itself to continue."
3,Not My Favorite by Meltzer,"I've read a few books by Brad Meltzer, and this one is my least favorite. I wasn't crazy about the characters and the plot dragged out.This is one to check out at the library, not buy."
5,Great read,This is the second book of Meltzer's that I have read. They were both interesting and fast pased. I live a book that I run to read.
1,False advertisement,"This book has nothing to do with the Masons or the book of Fate. It is a gory thriller with rather predictable outcomes and an anticlimactic plot. Much of the disappointment that the book creates is due to the title and description. For those who are interested in a well-crafted conspiracy drama that cleverly weaves historical fact with fiction, don't waste your time on this book!!!"
1,More Like The Book of Cheap Marketing Ploy,"I admit that the cover and back flap are what drew my attention to this book. The sad thing is thats what the publishers were counting on. One would assume that since the cover contains a square and compass, that the Freemasons would be invovled. One would also assume after reading the back cover of the book, that there is a 200 year old secret involving Thomas Jefferson. Well ladies and gentlemen, you would be wrong. The Freemasons are ""mentioned"" in this book a grand total of 3 brief times. The 200 year old ""secret"" is glanced over so briefly near the end, that I actually had to go back and reread a chapter to realize it. Basically what you have here is a cheap and shameless attempt to cash in on the ""DaVinci Code and National Treasure"" craze. What you actually get is a less than average political thriller... Shame on you Meltzer."
1,did they glue the wrong cover on the book?,"This book truly inspires anyone to become a writer. It shows anyone can do it. The premise of the book is based on ""DaVinci Code"" style intrigue, evidenced on the cover, which never seems to occur. The characters are shallow and one-dimensional. You never care what happens to the self absorbed characters. You are asked to believe that political operatives at the top of the game fall for reporter tricks, etc. Total nonsense. I would encourage readers (and Mr. Meltzer) to go read Michael Connelly, Daniel Silva or even Stuart Woods."
2,Not enough research,"It's funny - he talks about his 3 years of research in the Masons....yet the recurring scream Wes hears (way too many times in this book) is in ""C Minor."" Here's the problem, any minor musical research would have told him C minor is a chord or a key signature, and requires at least 3 notes...every time I read about the C minor scream, I kept thinking ""moron."" You can't scream 3 notes, or a full scale, which are the only things designated as C minor.Wes was an annoying protagonist....well into his 30s and unable to stand up for himself...even at the end.Book was OK, but certainly not brilliant....and way too long....random dead people everywhere, and no discussion of what happened when the random bodies were found....If he spent 3 years researching what was an unbelievably minor (no pun intended) part of the story, he could have gone for realism a bit more in the other 450 pages!"
2,Not worth the time,"I was really looking forward to reading The Book of Fate because I had heard so many good things about the author. After the first 50 pages or so, I knew I was in trouble. What a complicated and mostly boring book. It took me many days to finally finish it. Everytime I'd start it, I'd fall asleep. What a struggle. Don't waste your time or money.After lots of research on some of his other books, I'm going to give Brad Meltzer another chance. He has to be better than what he showed in The Book of Fate."
3,A good vacation read,"""The Book of Fate"" is another post ""DaVince Code"" novel. As books go its not that bad, but plot wise it does run a little thin.The premise of this novel is fantastic, when i first heard about it, I couldn't wait to read it, however the second half of this novel falls quite a bit flat.If you need a novel for a plane ride or beach read i don't think you'll be dissapointed. But if you're looking for a novel that will challenge your way of thinking as the publishers claim it will, look somewhere else, they're lying. Its a fun, easy ready, but thats about it."
5,Audio Book,"Nice price for unabridged edition of this book. First read of this author, and I recommend his books."
3,Some Good - Some Bad,"The book cover claims ""two-century-old code and penetrate the secrets of Masonic history"". But there really isn't but a smattering of that - and the story doesn't hinge on it at all. Mostly cloak and dagger - the reader knows more than the main character, so you know killers are closing in. The escape of the phychotic shooter (who made an assasination attempt on the president) seems contrived just for the climax of the story. The ending was a bit predicatable. The author did present a wounded hero who is struggling with his brush with death. The best friend character was comic relief in an otherwise serious story. It is a modest suspense novel - not epic but worth the read."
2,The quintessential 'Monkeys with typewriters' pop novel,"Like so many ""thrillers"" these days, it appears to have been written by a committee on a tight deadline.Plot holes abound, minor characters enter and exit with no real purpose, some sequences end too quickly while others go on interminably. And the topper -- ""let's put in some references to Masonic codes and secrets to capture the Dan Brown fans"" -- that's such a blatant marketing ploy it makes your head spin.By about the 10th time Wes started to cry, I wanted to off him.That's it for this author."
1,Borrrring,I was so looking forward to reading this book. It sounded like a good read. I forced myself to read 100 pages hoping it was just a slow take off. Not so. Don't bother.
3,A well-paced political thriller,"I found Wes to be a compelling protagonist, and his personal journey was satisfying overall. I appreciated Meltzer's attention to detail, and his ability to write gripping action set pieces. Rogo may be the highlight of the book as a truly memorable wingman."
4,Fun to read with a few good twist,"After reading Meltzer's Millionaires I was a little disappointed in this story. But, I have come to respect his work. As a whole Meltzer's average story beats other authors good stories hands down. This story has a lot of good content as well as a nice development of the motivations and actions of Wes Hollow as President Manning's aide. I was worried that this book would be an attempt to replace The DeVinci Code by Dan Brown but I was very happy to find out that it wasn't drowned in secret/hidden meaning or secret society hunts. This was a great story it mythology related to masonry and tied it to a set of believable events. The plot twist and search for a mole within this novel will keep you reading page after page. I can't say more about the story without giving away some of the mysteries that make this book so fun to read. I give this book 4 out of 5 stars."
4,Complicated plot,You won't figure out the end of this book until the last page. Just hope there are no people in our government like the ones portrayed in this spellbinding novel.
1,Poor writing can't save this story,"First, I'll freely admit, I only made it through 1/3 of the book, so my review must be judged with that in mind.This was my first story by this author, and I hate to say it, but his writing style did not fit well with me. For starters, his decision to write in the first-person drove me absoltely nuts. Many sentences included I over and over, at first I noticed it, then it got tedious, then it started to drive me nuts. I know there are somewhat conflicting opinions on first-person writing, but from what I understand it takes a real talent to make it work, I don't think Brad has that ability.Second, and this is harder to nail down, but the more I read it, the more I felt like the writing was forced, or just didn't read well. It was like an out-of-tune guitar, the tune was correct, but it sounded god-awful.Its sad to say, but I think the only reason this book made it to the top of the list was because it is knock-off of the Da Vinci Code, or at least Da Vinci-esque."
2,"This is no DaVinchi Code. Borrow, don't buy.","After listening to the NPR review I couldn't wait to get my hands on a copy of Meltzer's new book. The NPR review stated that Meltzer does meticulous research for his books and that his books are lies that try to sound like the truth. The book is sold on the premise that there is a mystery involving the presidency of the United States and that the Free Masons are somehow involved with the fate of everyone. Meltzer fails to make a convincing argument.The book seemed under researched and poorly attempts to tie loose ends of secret societies together. It makes very little mention of the masons with any substance or character. The idea of fatalism is a great idea for a book, but after reading Meltzer's version the great idea remains. If you enjoyed the DaVinchi Code by Dan Brown, you will be let down. If you want a relatively quick read that is implausible, superficial, dime store-book entertainment, this book will not disappoint."
2,I am so glad I got this book at the library! SKIP IT,This book had a good premise that soon went bad .it is bloated and gets to over 500 pages with boring filler.I found Wes to be whiny and frankly his character drove me nuts. His self pity and lack of action got very tedious.It can get back to the library fast enough.
1,"Confusing, Strange & Boring","My Headline says it all. This book starts out with so many unknown characters that it is confusing. Then it gets strange. Then it gets boring. I tried to finish it, but finally gave up to read something worth my time."
1,Yuck! Glad I didn't buy it!,"Meltzer's earlier books weren't bad at all. But this one!!! The protagonist is a loser; talks and works like one. Sets a poor tone for the rest of the drivel. The plot wanders according to fate, no contact with the author.If Warner Books stays with him, I hope his next offering is much better!"
1,Piece of Crap!,"This book is poorly written, predictable, formulaic, juvenile, and a complete waste of time. I am just as angry with myself for investing the time into reading this book, as I am at the author and publisher for putting such a piece of crap out there for mass consumption. Save yourself some time and go read a third grader's essay at you local elementary school--it will be a better use of your time than reading this book!!This book makes me wish Amazon would allow a rating of zero stars."
1,Disappointed,"I've enjoyed all of Meltzer's other books. I could only force myself to read 3/4 of this one. There are too many other GOOD books out there to waste my time on this muddled, boring, tedious book. I hated all the characters, the plot was confusing and far-fetched. I didn't like the fact that he tells whats going to happen before it happens, and then tells about it again when it happens. Hopefully, Mr. Meltzer will read these Amazon reviews and realize his fans would like him to stick to the formulas that have worked for him before."
1,Waste of time,"This book was flat, flat, flat. I read a review somewhere that said it was the best thing since sliced bread. Don't remember where I read that, but I wish I remembered so that I could sue them for the hours of my life that I lost to this terribly dull and uninteresting book."
4,A great chase,"A tremendous look into the world of an ex-president. It has a very involving and readable plot. I never did understand the how the ""Book of Fate"" or the Mason's were involved, seemed like a calculated superficial plot element intended to cash in on the ""Davinci Code"" craze. But it was a very engrossing and plausible ameture vs spy plot. Very well written. I am still happy to have read it."
2,"Two attempts to listen, to no avail...","Usually I enjoy any audiobook that Scott Brick narrates. He killed this one, I have to say.I purchased ""The Book of Fate"" on the first day it was released in anticipation of a good story of the Freemasons. After starting this audiobook two times, I can't even get through CD #1 because of Scott Brick's slow, choppy, monotone narration. And, as the previous reviewer noted, the story is just too long. Could be more interesting if there were less of it! I have no desire to hang in there for 14 more CDs.This one will go back on the shelf for awhile. Perhps it will peak my interest at another time.Get it from the library and/or get the print version. I am sorry I rushed to purchased this one. Fortunately, I had a discount coupon and didn't pay full price!"
1,SHAME! on you Brad Meltzer!,"Shame on you Brad Meltzer. This is an UNFINISHED work that you allowed to be published. Cover to cover this is an AWFUL book. The plotline is steady enough, but seriously. You lead the reader down a number of interesting threads that NEVER go anywhere. The Masonic backdrop? You know the cover of the book? NEVER goes anywhere. Please at least do a droplet of research (see Freemasons for Dummies). Your main character...I was left really not liking the guy at all in the end.BRAD MELTZER...do the right thing. Recast this book! It is far from finished. You have cheated your readers. A good start...but you are a year away from publication quality. Oh yes, and shame on you Warner books. i won't forget."
2,"Confusing, at best","Too many ""what if's"" in this book make it a lesser read. The author spends so much time spinning different scenarios, that by the time the mystery is actually solved, I didn't care anymore. I thought maybe it was just another ""what if."" The main character, Wes, is such a whimpy, low self-esteem character, that I had a hard time relating. (Okay, I know, he was shot and that would get me down, too, but MOVE ON ALREADY!) And the ending Epilogue section was just pointless and full of filler. I would not recommend this book for anyone looking for a ""thinking man's"" thriller."
2,Too many unanswered questions,"This was written well and keeps you interested. However, it starts out like the Da Vinci Code and ends up like a simple story about theft.We are never told what the ""book of fate"" is, if it actually exists, and if it did how it was used. The tie in with the masons is laughable."
1,Not impressed at all,"I bought the DVD DR from Digital Innovations in the hopes of restoring a couple of discs that I had that weren't working properly. After using the DVD DR. on them (One was a DVD, the other an audio CD) Neither disc is in any way usable. The DVD became completely unplayable, and the audio CD never showed any improvement, even after several attempts. I followed the directions, and even went online to see if they had any further advice on their website. I would not recommend this product.TJG"
5,Very good adn real entertaining.,"What team was averaging 18,100 fans before his arrival and after his arrival over 35,000? The New York Mets and the person to whom this attendance-doubling feat goes to is Mike Piazza. Watching the way the Mets have performed since his arrival is one of the reasons they are one of the top ball teams in the National League.Since his arrival in New York, Piazza has taken his team from mediocre to the NLCS and nearly pulled off one the biggest upset in baseball. Piazza abilities behind the plate are as impressive as his interaction the fans of New York outside the gates.Over 125 pages packed with stories and photos, this is one book for every serious Mets or Piazza fan. The book only covers Mike's time in New York, so if you are looking for the definitive biography this is not he book. Price under $25.00 this book is certainly a good value for the money."
5,ASIA IS BACK-WELL WORTH THE MONEY,ASIA IS BACK!! The Original Members of Asia show after 25 years since release of the 1st CD and this CD shows they have not lost a thing.Wish they had recorded in different country as they would have had a much more enthusiastic audience.
3,"Good music, terrible mix","I cannot believe that this was recorded in japan, where audio standards are well known.The producer and the engineer mixed this with their A..Didn't the band listen to this tortilla prior to its launch? unbelievable.Vocals are way up, drums and keyboards are lost. Bass is muddy.The song selection is a good asia/ELP/Crimson/Yes mix. Wetton can still sing quite good. Howe plays several new runs here and there. Good for hardcore fans and newcomers, otherwise, get the fist studio album and you are done."
3,Needs a remixing,"I saw the reunited Asia in concert in Toronto on Canada Day weekend and this recording doesn't do the band justice. Carl Palmer's drumming at the Toronto show was astounding...he was the driving force behind the performance and his kit sounded incredible. But I find the drums are buried on this recording...I have to strain to hear some of his rolls because they're simply muffled. As well, John Wetton's vocals are too far ""up front"". The music needs to be a bit louder to achieve a better balance.All that said, this is still a good performance and the ""unplugged"" versions of Don't Cry, The Smile Has Left Your Eyes and Ride Easy are fantastic."
4,Like coming home,"Wow it is great to hear the original line up again, and John Wetton's voice seems stronger than ever. Some sound just like the original songs and others sound like arrangements that would have been worth seeing live...we can only hope thet are up to going into the studio and creating some more magic!!!"
5,Outstanding!,"I was a bit more than pleasantly surprised upon my first listen of this fantastic album. Meticulous in every respect, you'd be hard pressed to find four musicians that top these gentlemen. I love their rendition of ""video killed the radio star"". And truly the finest rendition of ""the smile has left your eyes"" they've done to date. I too consider John Wetton one of the finest vocalists on earth. And Steve Howe's guitar and mandolin playing never sounded better.The press and public did them ""dirty"" a few decades ago, but Asia has staying power and excellent material to see them through. I'm ecstatic that they're back again. I met John Wetton in May 1996. You won't find a finer gent anywhere. And his guitar and bass playing coupled with Downes and Palmer move like a well-oiled music machine. Great album (er`oops CD). Buy it and ride easy."
4,Surprising & Enjoyable....,"The vintage tracks from Yes, ELP, & King Crimson alone were nearly worth buying the record. I never thought the Buggles were anything to brag about since their only claim to fame was being the first video.. you know the rest. They played that tune just to appease Geoff Downes who really never had any success on his own. It was evident when he tried to hold Asia together after everyone split. Anyway.... wish they would have recorded a show in the states somewhere, probably wouldn't have drawn what they did in Japan though. Wish they would have put Starless & Bible Black on here. Like I said up top, they earned some serious cool points for Roundabout, In the Court, etc... & did Steve Howe a solid by letting him do his virtuoso thing. Should have went all out on Don't Cry... forget doing the acoustic version."
2,Ho Hummm,"Straight up, this is a rather dull sounding and boring cd/dvd. Steve Howe's guitar (as good as he is) just simply sounds boring and has no life whatsoever. Bass sounds good and all, drums are good, vocals, so so, but over all this is just a one time listen if you're a fan and put it away forever. Disappointed. If they had some life and punch to their live sound, they'd be pretty awesome. But it's just not here at all. Only 2 stars because I will never have a desire to listen to or watch this again, although it was cool to see them on dvd. Highlight of the concert is Carl's drums in the middle of here comes the feeling."
3,Fantasia Live,I purchased Fantsia Live in Tokyo double CD cause have a few albums on Vinyl of King Krimsom & Yes and Steve Howe has a reputation for being an excellent guitarist so bought Asia's first CD in Years Phoenix and wasn't disappointed and as for the double CD Live in Tokyo Good if you're a fan 3 and a half out of 5 .
5,ASIA Live in Tokyo 2CD 2007,"The Original ASIA line-up back together for the 25th Anniversary!! Wetton's vocals are indeed up to par and the musicianship is as good as ever! This 2-Disc live set also includes intriguing covers of ""Roundabout"", Intersection Blues"", ""Fanfare for the Common Man"" and ""The Court Of The Crimson King"" not previously released on CD by the original line-up (Like ""Video Killed The Radio Star"" was on ""Live From Russia""). A must have for any fan of the original ASIA incarnation and their 3 releases (before Thrall replaced Howe and Wetton's departure, and the subsequent line-up). One can only hope that these four re-unite and create new studio music for us die-hard fans! Add this to your ASIA cd collection as fast as you can!"
3,Differents Keys!,"This is really a great book if you love the musical and you just want to play the music for fun. I bought this book to prepare for an audition to be in south pacific. I practiced for a few weeks and was very comfortable with the songs in the book, but when the actual audtion music was handed out, it was in different keys. All of the things I practiced had to be changed and it made it very stressful. This book is a really good representaion of the music, but it is NOT in the same keys as the original score."
1,NOT A KARAOKE CD!!,"If you want a great cdg disc of Queen songs to use in your karaoke machine, THEN DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM! This disc is not only lacking the video portion of a karaoke disc (no lyrics for screen,) THE SONGS ARE NOT PERFORMED BY QUEEN! This disc sounds like some guys got together with a kids Casio keyboard and re-recorded Queen songs in their basement.Again, if you are looking to sing Queen songs through your Karaoke machine, THEN DO NOT BUY THIS MISLEADING ITEM!"
2,Please enter a title for your review,"When I saw this listed I was hoping it was a new album from the band that made Hot Saki & Bedtime Stores and Sorry, but it's just a new generic creativityless emo/metalcore band. The vocals are kinda powerful but kinda overproduced. They're actually the only instrument that is produced well. The guitarist cycles through an indiscriminate showreel of generic mosh, melodic, and dissonant metalcore riffs without ever coming close to an original idea or even doing justice to the conventions of the techniques he's using. It's just a really weak redundant album."
2,Kung Fu or Kenpo?,"While not a badly done book, The title is misleading. The techniques in this volume are very basic, what one might learn in the first 3 months or so of study. What is shown is clearly American Kenpo, and bears very little resemblance to any form of Chinese boxing. Basic blocks, punches, and a few kicks Nothing on history, this book would probably be of greatest value to someone with no martial arts experience who, due to circumatsnaces (such as living in a rural area where no teacher was available), had no other option for study."
4,This is a really pretty set.,"This set comes with lots of claires jewelry,and many accessories from claires.And this set looks like a real claires store, no kidding.strongly recomend this for eny girly girl.P.S end the bratz/my scene warLENZIE:)"
4,"Stylish, comfy, basic","I was looking for a comfy, black heel and these Aerosoles wedges are perfect. Also, a great value for money."
5,WhAt Is ThAt?!?!,"How to describe Nuclear Rabbit's genre? It's kinda funky surfin'skankin' trashy cartoonesque. Sounds crazy,uh? Well,not really,'cause NR melodies always sounds great and needs just somenone-judging ears to appreciate it. For all Mr.Bungle,FNM,Primus,and System of a down fans. And for this album? It is the most complete NR's CD. Jean Baudin's bass tapping techniques are just so cool,he plays it with so much simplicity that it's abberant.Sigaty on drums is also particularely talentuous on this CD, withvarious tempo changes and his habitual speed. And this is singer's most demanding work ever...ever! From tiny songs to fat metal,he can handle everything... A most!"
4,Better than Vicuna,"After the Slim's show in November w/ MSI, i got this CD and as a whole its pretty good. Bassist Jean Baudin certainly shines out w/ his custom 9 - string bass in most songs. Probably the best song by Nuclear Rabbit ""My Girl's Got Guts"" is on this album along w/ the screaming ""Crane to the Head"". I haven't heard Mutopia yet, but start off w/ this Nuclear Rabbit CD"
4,a form of flattery unsurpassed,"if nb can't be rightly praised for their originality why not the way they immitate the chops and vocals of mr bungle? i'm lucky to come across this band because like many fans of bungle's ou818, easter bunny, etc., disco volante and california was a bit of a disappointment. i would recommend this band instead of system of a down or the more lackluster bungle clone, tub ring, whose bungle-esque experimentation with odd time signatures and genre bending sound contrived and un-organic. check out vicuna brings you back to the mad ska heyday of mr. bungle!"
2,Obvious and Common Platitudes,"Competent advice on raising children to be responsible and successful individuals is invaluable, and Wayne Bryan is easily qualified as a tennis pro having raised two very successful tennis players. The bulk of the book focuses on the efforts needed to steer children in the right direction using positive reinforcement, goal setting, and motivation through encouraging passions.The book loses some luster on the quality of its advice which ranges from the well known to the obvious. I'd question any parent who did not already understand the value of positive environments, inspiring passion in children, and steering kids away from drugs and other harmful habits. The challenge is how to help promote these ideals constantly, an area where Bryan's book is lacking."
1,Bloodrights,"I loved Faraday's Orphans. I was surprised at how bad this was. There's scarcely an original bone in the body of this pseudo-medieval, lumberingly written tome. There's a princess trying to get her kingdom back. There are thewed warriors and sexy assassins and all such things. The structure actually has its interesting points, and the author avoids the worst genre cliches, but the writing was so dull and mundane that I found the book unreadable."
4,A solid fantasy book.,"Bloodrights by N. Lee Wood was enjoyable. It had all the elements for a sucessful fantasy read. This included good action, characterization, and well paced. If you liked N. Lee Wood's first book The Return of the Mahdi, then you will probably find this book enjoyable."
4,Good build quality and exceptional tv reception,I own this antenna and I have to say that it is much better than I expected. For the price I didn't expect much in terms of good tv reception. All local tv stations do come in relatively well and the adjustments allow you fine tune the channels. Another great feature is the double RF outputs. You can connect the antenna to 2 video sources and skip the cable routing. The overall design is excellent and I can definitely see this antenna last for years to come.
2,You get what you pay for,"Simple to hookup. UPN and WB comes in crystal clear. PBS and PAX comes in fuzzy, but clear enough to see what's going on. NBC and CBS does not come in at all.Better than nothing and for the price, I guess I can do without CBS and NBC."
3,Great Value,"Not the most impressive antenna in the world, but it can't be beat for the price. Overall, a great value."
3,Shovelware publishing from FOE,"I think this book is a great idea, so three stars. ... Here we have yet another collection of chapters by designers who haven't communicated with each other, and apparently don't have a strong editor with an overall vision, so the book doesn't develop an idea throughout. That's fine if you like the rockstar approach, but why not just look at these guys' websites instead?The problem with this is that there's just nothing new here. Everything here, and I mean everything, is available on the web, especially if you make contact with people and learn from work they've done.Still, it's nice to see a somewhat unusual topic get a whole book, and Golan Levin is a genius, full stop, so I'm glad he's getting noticed."
3,Detroit Rawk at its best,"Two years ago, I saw these guys almost steal the show from the headliners White Stripes. ""Raw and Rare"" is a perfect description for these guys and gals and this disc will help tide over fans for their next album. A collection of mostly live tracks from the ""Lack of Communication"" material. These tracks do sound thicker and livelier than the studio versions and a better indication of the band's explosive live perfomances. Also included here are a couple killer covers. ""R & R Nurse"" is great reworking of the Compulsive Gamblers tune and ""Take a Heart"" is 7 minutes of pure Rawk. The album concludes with two specially recorded tracks, but are pretty much throwaways.As a fan, I really enjoyed this CD, but if you are new to the band, I suggest trying ""Lack of Communication"" first as an introduction to this band."
2,Stealing,"I love the Von Bondies and how they just rock your socks, but you can't steal David Bowie as Ziggy Stardust's stage artwork. That lightening bolt in the circle was either painted on Bowie's forehead or on display behind the stage. That's his lightening bolt, the same design. I know lightening bolts are common, but if you look at David Bowie's use of it, it is in the exact same shape as this cover. I guess I enjoy their homage to D Bo, I can only hope they mention that in the liner notes."
2,Not Totally Satisying!,"Despite the claim that this caters to the needs of plaintiffs, defendants and medical consultants, this book is primarily geared to the legal practitioner who needs a comprehensive background knowledge in medicine and clinical practice. This is so obvious when a major portion of the book is dedicated to ""Medicine for Lawyers"". The book gives a respectable overview of the nuances of medical practice. This may be helpful to the uninitiated prosecuting or defending a malpractice case. Those already deep into the practice of medical litigation will find it trite. I find it too expensive for its contents. There are other books on the subject matter with more meat at less cost."
3,A Dissapointment,"Yes, the beadwork is wonderful. If you are new to beading, I would highly recommend this book. Unfortunately, people who have been interested in beading for any amount of time will find that many of the pieces pictured in this book have been previously published in other books and magazines. I was disappointed that I had seen so many of these pieces before, pieces that I already have in my beading library. It is curious that the editor did not request unpublished material instead of filling this book with so many retreads."
1,"Speaking Respect, Respecting Speech is virtually unreadable","The book is all but unreadable, choosing to toss names and names and names at the reader instead of addressing any of the issues behind the names. The author lists conflicts without taking sides or even bothering to explain the deeper issues behind the conflicts, leaving the names and quotes empty and meaningless. This may sound like an exaggeration, but it was physically painful for me to read this book. If you are looking for a book on the topic of free speech, I would recommend that you look elsewhere."
4,Gear keeper,We use these at work to keep our scanners clipped to our belts. Works great! No snags in line and supports the wieght.
4,oakstand,"I liked the nightstand, it was made very well, but it wass too short, so I had to send it back."
2,HP writer,"I bought this back in October 2001, and since then I've been trying to find a software that support this writer, but with no luck, as Easy CD creator, WIN onCD and Nero dose not support this drive. I sent several emails to HP requesting if they know about a software that support their drive, but they suggest to use the software that comes wiht it, which is a very bad one and is not powerfull at all :(You get a lot of buffer under-run problems with it, and I got like around 20 coasters from this writer. I wish that HP have a burn proof tech. in the new version of this driver."
3,Very Good Burner,"I bought this drive back in December of 2001 and since then, it has been working very well for what burning tasks I had to do such as files, photos, music CDs etc. The HP software that came with this drive offers limited applications. I've used Easy CD Creator after doing some downloads from the web, but I couldn't use memory sticks for my computer's USB ports or dirvers wouldn't recognize them. No other burner softwares supports this drive."
1,cashin' in,Q: Why did the punk cross the road? A: Because Ian told him to. Flex your head and spend your cash on something better.
2,Some killers but a lot of mediocre music too,"I've had this box set in my CD player for a month now. As much as I hoped it would grow on me, it has not yet. As brilliant as Minor Threat and Government Issue were, the reason why you probably never heard of a lot of these bands is simply because their songs weren't very good. I doubt many people will hit repeat on their CD player to hear the generic noise of Gray Matter or the insufferable Rites of Spring multiple times. That said, there are some good singles strewn throughout like Marginal Man's ""Missing Rungs,"" Circus Lupus' ""Pop Man,"" and Embrace's classic ""Money."" Dischord is an unassailable indie label, so it is no surprise that they would choose to democratically showcase all the artists on their roster rather than focus in on a few popular bands. Still, much of this music simply makes no impact at all."
4,2nd cd is the best,"the first cd is dischord as a hardcore label. the second cd is dischord as a more general indie/punk label. there are a bunch of great bands on the second, like lungfish, fugazi, q and not u, and the warmers. there are also a bunch of great bands on the first, like minor threat, government issue, shudder to think, and rites of spring.it's a $25 value for a pair of mix cd's plus a rare/unreleased disc that i haven't really gotten into. it's worth it just for the experience of listening to new music that probably won't disappoint (mostly). if you hate hardcore, this might be too expensive to be worth it.it costs 2 cents more at dischord, but they don't charge for S/H, ever."
5,"Okay, you really, REALLY need this.........","Anyone with any passing interest in punk or hardcore needs to order this box set. 74 fantastic tracks, and not a single bad one.The names speak for themselves: Minor Threat, Fugazi, Void, Scream, The Nation of Ulysses, Jawbox, Rites of Spring, Beefeater, Lungfish, The Faith, State of Alert...... practically every good band to release anything in the DC Hardcore scene in 20 years, aside from Bad Brains.Great packaging too, the booklet is great, even if the intro by Henry Rollins is a little long. Great value for your money, you gotta get this if you like Punk/Hardcore. Order it from the official Dischord website though."
2,"If I could get batteries in, I think they would be great!","I got these scissors from my sister. I only have the instructions and the scissors themselves, no packaging. The instructions show how to open the handle and put the batteries in, BUT I can not get it open. I've had other people try to open it, BUT no one can do it. So, if I could get the batteries in I think they would be great.If there is someone out there who knows if there is a secert way to open, or maybe it's so simple I'm missing it. HELP, I would really like to use them"
1,This is not what I purchased,"The game I ordered was tetris, instead I got 2 demo games. Neither are full games. What a rip. It was a gift for my daughters birthday. A total waste of money."
4,It's Tetris,"It was a new take on Tetris, ten years ago. These days it's outdated, but for $10 through San Francisco Goodwill for a near-perfect copy, it was well worth it."
3,Great team - crummy DVD production,"Being a Pens fan I was looking forward to the release of the season highlight video. Although all Pens fans will enjoy watching the DVD, the production was poor. Audio mixing was downright awful. There was plenty of good local TV video available that would have made a much better presentation for the segments in the DVD. It appeared as though Warner Brothers may have wanted this to look like a DVD made with film not video tape by slowing the frame rate down. The video quality was mediocre, however. If you are looking for something you would expect from NFL films, you will be disapppointed.Nonetheless, for Pens fans it will be enjoyable. Too bad the NHL does not have a better deal with someone other than Warner that could have done a much better job of presenting a great and memorable season."
2,Disappointed,I purchased this to send to my brother in Australia thinking that it contained all 7 games of the Stanley Cup 2009 against the Red Wings. It doesn't.
2,Just the boring...,"The title is right, it is just the facts but it is also just plain boring. I tried to use this video for a criminal justice class on courts and it was a snooze fest! Yes, it had some good info but was delivered in a monotone fact and picture way that made the students stare blankly. I did like how it went over in plain terms details of the supreme court through the course of history but GEEEEZ, even I wanted to fall asleep! I would recommend maybe using the video with a lesson plan in a start/stop type. Do lecture and activities then use the video to drive home a point in 2 min increments. The hard part will be that it does not have a scene selector so you will need a program to cut and take what you want."
2,doesn't stick,Product wont stay stuck to ceiling - keeps falling. We put stars up a couple of years ago with a type of sticky putty that came with them & they are still up. the tape squares with this product don't hold at all.Also it doesn't stay glowing as long or as brightly as original stars.
5,Truly a gift...,"David Drake presents not just a play of incredible power and honesty, but a lyrical poem of universal truth and an insightful history lesson. No, this is not your typical Aristotelian drama, but that is partially why I love it so much; the other huge reason would be Drake's challenge to the complacency and the overwhelming lack of anger in the gay community. There's plenty to be angry about for anyone -- gay, straight and in-between -- and Drake presents his rage and his humanity in a form that is accessible, moving and real. This play is a gift to anyone who loves dramas that expand the realms of possibility or who have ever felt the activist spirit churning within."
5,"Great price, great songs, great introduction...","The Staple Singers sing classic bluesy gospel music and they mostly swing, when they sing. Most of these sides were recorded in the 60's, but his cd gives a good overview of thier passionate style, and Mavis Stpales takes a few soaring gospel tinged solos."
5,Inspirational book,"Great book, chock full of inspiration. Product as was described, arrived on time, great service! Would recommend this shop. Thanks!"
2,"About Swordmakers, not swords, not swordmaking.","This is a book about German swordmakers. It contains very little information about swords in the technical sense, e.g. construction methods or design evolution. There is a listing of the swordmakers names, dates of swordmaking and family connections. There are many pictures of Solingen factories and other historical venues. There is a list of maker's marks which does not seem to be complete nor is it presented as such. There is not much in the way of pictures of swords showing types, characteristic designs, patterns or maker innovations. The photos are of questionable quality and most of the pictures are illustrations with little provenance. Some interesting information on which makers also exported to the U.S. is included. As is usual these days, there is no appendix or detailed Table of Contents. A good book for historians but not so good for the collector."
2,Specific Book for Specific Purpose,"This is a fair book. Overall it does provide history of German blade-smithing and lists most of the German sword marks. The book provides good facts, but lacks completeness of the sword manufacturers and is missing a number of sword-makers. The sword illustrations are terrible, the photos are very few and are of poor to average quality. The bibliography is absent and some facts are somewhat questionable. If you are a collector or dealer, like me, this book is OK at best. The author could have done a much better job."
1,I didn't get a thing from this book.,"This book seems horribly dated. I question the authors own credentials based on the environment we are seeing in today's Internet economy. Particularly in light of Dottie Downturn with IPOs losing steam and the medium is growing increasingly competitive and a feeding frenzy of larger corporations with ties beyond the Net has absolutely started. This book did not give me the information I had hoped. Yes, I get the concept of building a solid business plan, but this offered nothing more than any other generic business plan book for me. Where's the substance for our eComm-driven environment?"
2,Not for Choir Practice,"I bought this unit primarily for use rehearsing our church choir. We use split track accompaniment CDs which have each song divided into multiple tracks for rehearsal purposes. This unit does not handle the transistions between tracks at all. It skips very badly at each track break. Also, it developed an electrical problem shortly after I purchased it last year. The RIGHT (Music) channel does not have nearly the volume the left (Vocal) channel has."
2,Sounds ok if you can't sing,"I bought this a few months back for a friend of mine. At first glance this system looks very professional but as soon as we turn it on, it was a different story. The speakers sound very flat. No bass/tremble at all. Save yourself some money and get a standalone karaoke mixer and an amplifier with 2 good stereo speakers. Not recommending this product at all"
4,Fun!,This was a great deal. We looked at this same machine for double the price. We have played it at home and took it to a park for a BBQ. Everyone loves it! It is pretty easy to use. The only complaint I have is that one of the microphones already broke.
4,"Great purchase, fun, easy to use.","Love it! Easy to setup, easy to use. The sound quality is excellent. The only fallback that I have found is that it does not play dvd karaoke. No problem though, we just hook up the dvd player and all is well. We had been using a smaller karaoke system (Singing Machine)until we wore it out and decided to upgrade to more bells and whistles and this has it. Well worth the money."
3,What Happened?,"I'm a huge Knapsack fan, mainly that of their last album ""This Conversation Is Ending Starting Right Now"". And it's a fairly easy comparrision of quality and music type between that album and the Jealous Sound EP. But.... What I dont understand is what happened with the new album. Just listen to the ""Anxious Arms"" version on the EP and then to the remake on the new LP and that explains it all. The Jealous sound has become slower, lower, less engergy, and well....basically... just plain boring."
5,Amazing!,If you liked the EP you will love this full length! 12 amazing songs with a unique sound to each of them. It is a must buy!
5,one of the best things I've heard this year,"This album has been well worth the wait since the first EP came out. Blair Shehan's works his usual magic on what I think just might be his most consistant release to date. All 12 tracks are strong and its tough to pick a standout. The lyrics seem to be a little easier to follow as well, while Blair's voice is just as unique as ever. He has the ability to put emotion into his songs while relaxing you the same time. The guitar work is equally strong and sing along's are common place. Indie rock (or whatever you may call it) at it's very best.. pick this one up"
2,Hope for Them,"&#65533;Hope for Us&#65533;, which opens The Jealous Sound&#65533;s long-awaited debut (their only EP was released in 2000), is one of those classic introduction cuts that set up high expectations for the songs that follow. kill them with kindness offers 11 other tracks of varying modern rock quality &#65533; none as must hear as the opener. After the faux-Anglo phrasing of &#65533;Hope for Us&#65533;, Blair Shehan and John McGinnis trade vocals in the style of Dashboard Confessional, Blink 182, and Green Day. Nothing makes me push the reject button. In fact, &#65533;The Fold Out&#65533; and &#65533;Troublesome&#65533; light up with power pop energy. And &#65533;Recovery Room&#65533; is like good slow Sebadoh. But nothing compels me to listen obsessively, either. But I await a sophomore effort in the hopes that they find the magic that is evidently close to their grasp."
2,snap broke...good until then,"I like the features of this case and it did well as a slimed-down wallet/pda combo. However, the neoprene material doesn't slide in and out of pockets very easily. Also, the male end of the snap broke off after 1 month, as it is attached to the neoprene which stretches...not very well designed..buy something else, imo...kiva822"
4,Father Flye,"I did enjoy this book. The personal stories told by former students was a look into the life of a favorite priest and teacher. The author found an entertaining way to shed light on one man's devotion to education and to God. In this new book, Hampton pays him tribute and tries to explain Flye's humourous, exasperating and often puzzling behavior. One thing is clear in this work by Bill Hampton, Father Flye made a lasting impression on his students and tried to foster in them a thirst for knowlege, respect for mankind and love of God."
2,"Good product, poor support","The E-100 is a good product but limited by the terrible support from Casio. None of the support numbers that come with the E-100 give access to a human for ordering purposes. It is impossible to find a modem for this so that one can access the internet. It is impossible to order anything via Casio's 800 numbers, brochures or online site. I have never been so frustrated in trying to spend money to upgrade a product only to be met by resistance by a company that doesn't want my money.I will never buy another Casio product after this experience."
3,Quality but still missing something,"The Casio Cassiopeia is a fine product. I enjoyed the time while I owned it. I took it back because of Windows CE. Several of the applications have no way of closing them. They don't have a close option in the file menu nor do they have the ""X"" box in any of the four corners. This was very annoying because it made you go to the equivalent of the close programs dialog box (like hitting alt-ctrl-del) every time you wished to close these programs.Things I did like were the voice recorder. I also enjoyed Outlook and the other MicroCrap applications. Sometimes MicroCrap suprises me."
1,it dosnt work like you think it works,ibought mt casio e-100 before acouple of weeks istartd working with it and isaw that there was alot of problams starting like chaning colors and the bettary is finished in 3 hours or so . ireplaced my casio e-100 with the compaq aero 2150 and ilike it very much itell dont buy it
2,Palm 5 vs. Cassiopeia,I have had both the Palm V and Cassiopeia E-100. The Cassiopeia is empressive when demoed but when it actually comes down to what you will use the Palm V is a lot easier to use and carry around. The Cassiopeia display doesn't work well outdoors cause you can barely read the screen and the battery runs out in a day or two ... where the palm 5 you can carry around for a month or so.
4,Great mp3/vid player but NOT a good game system.,"The cassiopeia E-100 is a great mp3 and video player! (very easy to use the win CE player) All you have to do is go to casio's website and look up E-100 and they have a link to Microsoft's download page for the winmedia player for CE.After that you just install the player on the cassiopeia; drag and drop all the mp3s you want in to the /my documents folder and when you run out of space on your E-100 just get a compact flash card (DIRT CHEAP on EbAy) and drop it into the expansion slot and your ready to go! The onlyproblem with it is there is ALOT of problems loading games on itso if your looking for a ""gameboy/pda"" get a Palm IIIc (I also have a Palm IIIc and that is a GREAT game system but that cant play mp3s)"
4,Pretty Neato,"I bought my cassie when it first came out years ago, when it was $500, plus accessories! I still don't have a desire to get anything more. There is one exception. If I ever need to go wireless, and although I could add the necessary accessories to my cassie, I might rather buy a new, smaller PDA with built in communications capabilities, like the Blackberry, or even one of those PDA phones."
3,"Get the E-125, NOT the 100","This is very bad, do not buy the 100, go for the E-125 it has more programs for it and is much better with 32 mb ram. I like the cassiopeia but the e-100 is way outdated, can't wate for the next line cuz it only gets betterThis is a very useful palm pc though, you can play movies, some games and read any e-book. It runs on very old windows ce 2.1 which they stopped making games for. Even Casio.com doesn't list anything about the e-100. but if you can buy it for under $100, it could be worth it if you just wanna listen to music and watch old simpsons episodes."
1,"All flash, low practicality","At a cursory, window-shopping level the Casio E-100 shines with its color screen, easy touch pad, and smart initial layout, but once you use it you realize it suffers functionally versus the Palms.It is too bulky for your pocket or even a jacket. The power switch is awkward to use. The power runs out quickly and needs to be recharged, so if you travel internationally it can't simply be plugged in whereas the Palm uses AAA battries that can be gotten anywhere. Despite being CE based it doesn't sync up with Outlook any better than the Palm. It has much less flexibility with capturing addresses and data which with the Palm can be better customized.Stay with the Palms, because Amazon will not take it back after 30 days if you don't like it,"
4,Taste Good But Not So Filling,When I think of a cereal bar I usually think of a quick breakfast. If I grab one of these for breakfast then the stomach would be growling long before lunch. They do taste great though. The multi-grain gives it a nice flavor and great cereal texture.
3,Great for someone who wants to do their best in school,"I reccomend this book to anyone who wants to do their best in school, and wants to improve their study skills. It has many tips in it and talks about many different things, from eating the right foods, to supplies, to how to do different things, like outlines."
3,Helpful in some ways but some unnecessary tips,"I think this book was good and well-researched, but some things were unrealistic. I felt that some of the tips encouraged dumping your straight B and below friends just to befriend the straight As peole. Tips like listening to classical music were kinda lame. If you listen to classical music, you should do it because you want to, not because you want to get straight A's. It was a well-researched book, but.. at many points unrealistic."
1,Pass on this,"I used this adapter for about two weeks, when it stopped working. I paid $75.00 for this product, which, in my opinion, is worthless. I suggest you pass on this one."
5,An Awe inspiring book.,"Jolie Otter is a woman who is in an abusive marrige. But, like a Phoenix rising from the ashes, she survives. D.B. Cowell touches on a subject that not many people have the courage to talk about, let alone write a book about it. I highly recomend this book to anyone who has lived or is living this hell. It is a survival guide. Otter's husband can break her heart but not her spirit. Jolie is a role model for abused people everywhere. It truely is an awe inspiring book. Please buy this book."
2,Nothing earth shattering,"I purchased this used to acquaint myself with lap booking ideas. There's not much in here that isn't available for free on the web, so unless you're getting it for ultra cheap, I'd skip it."
5,"Really, really good","I love this song! Listen to it, buy whatever! It's fantastic! It's gotta be good if it did really well in New Zealand!"
3,Item was chipped,"Although this is very pretty, when ours arrived, it was slightly chipped at the bottom. I would of kept it anyway and placed the crock so the chip didn't show but I also felt like the diameter of the crock was a little on the small side to hold the amount of utensils I had hoped. I ended up returning the crock. I do really think that the color is beautiful and that it is a really nice crock if you do not have that many utensils."
4,Cute but a little expensive,I purchased this utensil crock because I wanted something that would match my kitchen decor and not be plastic. I got the Sunflower color and it is a really nice looking crock although a bit smaller than I was expecting especially for the price. I'm not sure it was worth 35 dollars I paid for it but it is cute so I'm going to keep it. Probably could have found something similar somewhere else for cheaper though.
5,Parrothead Pottery,This was an EXCELLENT addition to my friend's parrothead kitchen. The colors are bright and add a touch of PARTY to the room!
4,Good Quality,This piece is very roomy and fits all of my spoons and spatulas. Looks very nice on the counter as well. Fiestaware makes a very good product.
1,Pretty,"This was pretty, but arrived cracked from the vendor. Sent it back and didn't replace as the color blue was much darker than pictured."
5,very interesting,we have all seen the finished products of any artist but knowing what goes through their mind is fascinating at times. It shows us the human side of the artist which makes him more complete as a person - very nicely done
4,Nice and the smell is not strong,The smell is ok but not what I expected. It has a very mild smell which some moms would love but i want it to smell more like a baby. I actually sometimes put in on myself to remind me of him when I'm at work.
5,Awesome Baby Cologne,"This is an awesome product! I love rubbing this stuff on my son after bathing him. It's not too high scented, nice and moderate and long lasting scent.After putting this on him I can still smell it on my hands for hours even after washing my hands.Really great product and recommend this for babies of any age."
1,I dont like the it !,"I had in my mind the memories od the Johnson cologne from when my kids were litlle, so I got this one for my grand dougther and the fracange is no really nice or durable I call my aunt in my contry and she sended me 3 bottles from Uruguay they are really different ! so nice and fresh I really do not understain why here the baby perfume is so different, also ther is no varaity a list you get something imported,"
5,"clean, smells like a baby but great for adults. lasts","I think anyone clicking on this probably is looking for a clean but not overwhelming scent. Probably you like the Johnson's lavender or sleepy time items. This cologne is for you! You can splash all over yourself after the shower and it gently fragrances your fresh clean clothing, leaving you feeling great all day."
4,Smells just like a baby!,"Having a boy has been a different experience for me than having a girl. Playing sometimes means missing his nap which makes him a complete crab when it comes to bedtime so we will occasionally skip the bedtime bath routine and head straight to bed. He's a boy. He likes to play. Playing + no bath = no baby smell.Johnson's Baby Cologne to the rescue! It's great for those days when he was just too tired for a bath. Just a couple of little splashes of this on him and he smells fresh and clean (albeit he's not but is that the point here?).I was a little worried that use of this might cause a rash and/or irritation being that my kids all have very sensitive skin. So far, so good. No signs of any reactions to it other than ""gee, he smells great!""Pros - Smells just like a baby does after a bathCons - Scent doesn't last terribly long although I have a feeling that might be a direct result of the way we use it"
1,Only recieved 1 bottle not 6,I ordered the 6 count and only recieved 1 bottle. I could have went to the store and bought it cheaper. SHAME ON AMAZON!
2,OK Phone - Terrible Company,"The Phone sounds good. The looks are a bit industrial. The size of the base is very large. Some of the operations are a bit mystical. If someone else answers the phone and you want to get on the same line and talk too or if your answering machine gets the call first, you need to push the line of the call once, wait for 2 seconds and then push the line again. If you have guests you need to train them on how to use the phone.Worst of all is the customer service department. If you call the 800 line it may take as much as 6-8 hours to get through. When I called and asked for a supervisor, I was put into voice mail. When I asked to speak to someone in sales or at least management, the receptionist gave me the message that customers can only talk to customer service and shouldn't bother anyone else. At this point I never wanted to buy another Uniden product."
4,"Needs to add ""1"" When Memorizing Caller IDs","I received this phone from my wish list for Christmas. So far so good, except for the fact that when it ""memorizes"" a number from caller ID, and you try to dial it later, it hasn't added the ""1"" before the area code. Thus you can't dial properly in the U.S. I'm looking for a fix to this problem. Otherwise good sound quality and reception."
4,An excellent value,"The 9800 is the only model I found from any manufacturer that combines digital spread spectrum, caller ID, speakerphone, and a digital answering machine all in one model. Having used it for a week now, I am happy to say it works great. And- at an affordable price.I basically doubled the range from my old (quality) analog cordless, but the real benefit is the clarity of the signal - no more static interference - none. I love it.The look and feel is nice, too, and the buttons fairly intuitive. It took almost no time to set up and go - good manual.The answering machine has all the right features, and I like being able to 'skip' a message (not easy with the old analog). The sound quality is a little weak, but adequate.I may try the headset attachment at some point. Overall, the best cordless I have ever had and I would recommend."
3,Good reception.. some basic problems,"Overall, the phone is good. However, I would not recommed it to a friend for the following reasons:1. The phone hangs up when you try to hold it between your shoulder and your ear. The ""Talk"" button needs to be relocated so you do not accidently disconnect2. Answering machine speaker is too low and not clear enough."
3,GOOD SOUND QUALITY EXCEPT FOR ANSWERING MACHINE,THE BASE IS VERY AWKWARD AND BULKY. SOUND QUALITY IS GOOD BUT THE ANSWERING MACHINE SOUND QUALITY IS TERRIBLE FOR INCOMING AND OUTGOING MESSAGES. THAT'S THE BIGGEST COMPLAINT.
1,EXS 9800 has good and bad qualities,"Good: -this phone has great clarity at long distances -hard to find all these features in 1 phone -easy to operate Bad: -messages are difficult to understand, muffled -my handset went dead yesterday, 3 months old, it's not the battery, so now I already have to send it in to Uniden for repairs.All and all, I would not buy this phone again."
2,Uniden EXS 9800,"Good reception, nice features, but poor digital recording playback quality. Microphone finally gave out after 1.5 yrs and decided not to buy another Uniden with this technology."
2,Random political tirades,"I really did not enjoy this book. The heroine comes across as exactly what she fears she may seem to her ex-boyfriend: emotionally cold. I could not at all identify with her, nor feel for her.It was slow going until the plot even remotely captured me. The storyline about the politician and his illegitimate child seemed forced, and an annoying distraction from the main character's own story.Most of all, though, I was annoyed by all that needless political tirades that seemed angry and out-of-place. France and Germany have sunk to ""second rate"" countries - what does that mean? Just because they do not agree with the Iraq war? ""Second rate"" how exactly? And since when is ALL of Europe blaming the Jews for EVERYTHING? That is so trite and superficial. And of course the stereotypes. The German journalist is a sturdy stocky middle-aged lesbian, and the French one wears f...-me shoes everywhere, even in rougher territory. Oh please!"
4,Any Place I Hang My Hat: A Novel,"It took several chapters for this book to engage me. Once I dropped into the rhythm of the story I enjoyed the contemporary setting, keen wit, quirky mental asides and frequent subplot references to Grandmother's proper use of etiquette. An enjoyable romance novel with good character development, enough tension and humor to keep an active mind interested as well as intelligent enough to hold the attention of a non-romance reader."
2,Boring,"By page 75, things still had not gotten off the ground. Just too boring to continue. This is the first Susan Isaacs book I haven't finished."
2,"Slow, clumsy read - I finished it just to see if it'd get better","If you'd like a complete plot synopsis, you can read one of the 40 other reviews on this book. I'll just say, the book is wordy, clumsy and gets in it's own way. Sometimes it feels more like someone's therapeutic writing than a story. I agree with another reviewer's assertion that the author's own insecurities and issues are full on display. There is a lot of agenda going on in this book. It's not a bad book, it just feels like there was no editor involved. Things repeat over and over and drag on. I liberally skipped paragraphs and sometimes pages just to get to the point, and kept reading just to see what happened and hoped that it'd get better. It didn't really. To the author's credit, I cared what happened to the character enough to keep reading despite the main character being a total narcissist."
3,"Not a BAD book, but....","This book isn't bad. It's a perfect light read for when you're tired and don't want to think.That said, it's a bit too glib. I started to feel as if the main character didn't have much good to say about anybody -- and if that's what being a hip New Yorker's about, I think I'll pass. Also, there were times when her description was intrusive, and a couple of scenes that could have been cut without any pain.A nice bit of fluff. I don't see myself thinking about it all now that I'm done, though."
3,Not really a page turner,"I am a big fan of this author, and in general, liked the book. However, although I did my share of laughing throughout, I found that the mid-portion of the book lagged and was too wordy. There were times when I truly felt the protagonist's angst and I liked the ending. Her descriptions of Tatiana and that family were hilarious and the sub-plots were interesting as well. This is probably the only one of Isaacs' books that I could put down before finishing."
3,"Some hilarious moments but as a whole, somewhat flat","Susan Isaacs' novel contains quite a few hilarious moments and delightfully sarcastic observations. It skewers all sorts of familiar types -- officious press secretaries, dull suburbanites, privileged WASPS who drink too much -- but does it in a knowing, enjoyable way. This book is fun to read.However, Isaacs' plotting is more than a bit episodic, and her treatment of love and romance is cliched. What could have been a hilarious comic novel amounts, at bottom, to an amusing instance of chick-lit."
1,Heavy-handed political tripe,"This book drove me batty! Amy broke her arm, as they say, patting herself on her back for being so intelligent. However, Isaacs just keeps telling us that Amy's another Einstein, but she doesn't show us her brilliance. And the politics! Give me a break! I felt like I was reading an article in The Nation. If that's your taste in politics, you'll feel right at home. It's nonstop liberal politics throughout the book, so be warned."
4,Shining Through is Superior,"I buy every Susan Isaacs book in hardcover the day they hit the bookstore. While this book was excellent, and very contemporary, Amy cannot hold a candle to fabulous, brave, funny Linda Voss.I give Shining Through to all of my girlfriends because it has everything. If you liked this book, click up and order Shining Through. Skip the Melanie 'licking her lips' Griffiths/Michael Douglas movie. it didn't come close to capturing the atmosphere, feel, or soul of the heroine.Back to Hang hat, this would make a good movie. I could see Julia Roberts playin the heroine - but she is a little too old now...sorry."
1,A new standup comedian,"I have thoroughly enjoyed Susan Isaacs' books and looked forward to reading this one. After 50 painful pages or so, I closed the cover with the relief that I was permitting myself to abandon the rest. Susan seems to be competing with Janet Evanovich, a writer I do not enjoy. When people have mentioned Janet, I say, ""Why not try Susan Isaacs? She has wonderful plots into which she weaves the most fantastic humor. I find myself suddenly laughing aloud."" Unfortunately, in this book the humor appears to be the main thrust with whatever plot there is taking backseat. She simply tried too hard to be funny. I did not choose the book to read one-liners, but that is what I got."
3,A Copelling Story,"I really enjoyed the story in this book. I thought the main character was very well developed, but the other characters were a bit one-sided and dry. It took me a while to actually get into the book, but once I did I was not disappointed. As other reviewers pointed out, the book is predictable, and a out of touch with reality, but overall not a bad way to spend an afternoon. I loved the literary snap shots of New York the book offered, and I can see how Issacs has become such a popular novelist."
1,What a disapointment!,"I have never written a review on a book before, but must because this book is a big letdown. I have read all of Isaacs other books and found them to be great funny reads. She was out to lunch on this one. I kept expecting something important to happen in the book, but it never did. Awful and Boring! The main character was so unlikeable I kept hoping she wouldn't get back together with her boyfriend. She didn't deserve him. If you are like me and have read all of the other books by her, don't automatically buy this one counting on a great few hours of reading, I did and it wasn't."
2,Not Good for USB Drives that Need Power,"It wasn't clear (at least to me) from the write-up in Amazon that the cord isn't thick enough to supply power to a USB hard drive. Says so right on the package, but too late. So BEWARE if you were hoping to use this cord with an external USB drive (as I was)"
1,I couldn't even bear to finish this series.,"To sum everything up at the start, I didn't find a single redeeming element in this particular series. The characters were all goofy and I didn't find myself liking any of them. The animation was weak and the art style B-grade anime fare. The storyline was also weak and goofy, and after three-quarters of the show it still didn't redeem itself. I still didn't care what was happening or what was going to happen.Now, I haven't watched the OVAs where this rehash was supposedly based on. Maybe I should, because I've heard and read from reviews that it is better. I'm not picky when it comes to anime, but even I couldn't get into this one. Be warned."
3,Eric Roberts is a lawyer?,"Eric Roberts has always been multi-talented and this movie showcases that. Crime fighter, boxer and all around good friend, Roberts works as a defense lawyer for an organized crime boss (Dean Stockwell). His sucess in the courthouse means trouble for him and his wife (model, Tatjana Patitz). Although the plot is typical, there are several familiar faces in this movie. As always, Roberts plays the part well and overall, the movie was a pleasant suprise."
5,Wonderful Classic for Modern Math Users,"Be you a mathematician or not, you should defintely own this classic algebra textbooks! It is the best in history I have ever seen. Nowaday's books on high school and beginning college algebra are like trash! This is the one to read."
5,Doug,"Boschert's gripping narrative, vivid descriptions and heartfelt style, make Talon a powerful story of brutality, courage, love and tragedy in twelfth century Persia.At an early age, Talon, the lead character, is taken as a captive deep into the sinister world of the Assassins; the historical ancestors of Al Qaeda. As Talon grows into manhood he encounters several tests that will challenge his humility, friendship and his sense of what is right and wrong.Talon's struggles are pure excitement.While Talon is fictional it is clear that vast amounts of time, energy and travel were expended in collecting research for the period.Boschert has written a novel that you cannot put down. Talon and Boschert's future works have earned a spot in my library. Now James, when can we expect the sequel?"
2,HP F50 Review,"DON'T but it! I bought an HP home PC almost two years ago, which included an F50 monitor. The monitor itself has great clarity and color and a nice aesthetic quality as well. The problem is a horizontal line of pixels burnt out about 1 1/2 years after I bought it. So basically I have a horizontal black line running dead center throught my monitor. When I called HP Support they told me my monitor needed to be replaced. I find this unacceptable after only a year and a half of use."
2,Ive never liked HP...,"I don't own this moniter myself, but I used it for a while at my friends house. When I first used it, I didn't think it was a flat screen, because it wan't any brighter or sharper than any other moniters. When you stare at the text and the pictures you can read it, but theres nothing really special to it. The bad part is when you scroll. When your scroll down, all the text, pictures, ect...become VERY blurry. It just looks like a big blob. If your a person who likes to scroll and read at the same time (like me), than this isn't the right moniter for you."
2,Are you Serious?,"Are you serious? While this may be somewhat fun, It's hardly a quality Kung Fu Flick. Sure they're all a bit fantastical and unrealistic but this is over (or should I say under) the top. The special effects are worse than usual, the fight scenes horrible and the cinematography was bad even for a Shaw Bros. movie. Closer to a Tom Baker Dr. Who ( which I actually like) than a Kung Fu movie. Not a movie for a true Kung Fu fan!.......will I watch it again?......you bet'cha!"
1,Worst thing ever,"This is basically a shooting competition video, but way worst. I could have made a better movie with a camera phone."
1,Unsafe to Use with any carseat,"NEVER use any extra padding in a carseat unless the seat came with it. Although I applaud the innovation and idea, truly needed, the design is seriously flawed. Reading the other reviews I see everyone says, ""I had to loosen the straps on the car seat..."". This puts your child at serious risk if in an accident as the padding will compress and suddenly the straps are not tight enough. Same goes for coats and buntings, they should NEVER be used with a carseat. For your baby's safety just use blankets or even get one of the seat covers that just go over the top of the seat, but anything that interferes with the straps is a BIG safety risk."
1,NOT A SAFE PRODUCT!!!,"This product is not a safe product and should not be used with your child. Not only does it give additional padding that was not intended, nor tested with your safety seat, but it also voids the warranty of the safety seat. NHTSA (National Highway Traffic & Safety Administration) is the government agency that sets standards for child safety seats and states that ""after-market products"" should not be used. It also does not meet FMVSS213 standards as stated in the manufacturer's description."
4,baby bundle me,"This was very good at keeping my baby warm in his car seat and saved me the trouble of putting on one of those snowsuitsto go out, the only concern was that it was maybe a little too warm on milder days, and you can zip off the front, but for those sub zero times you zip him up put on a hat and you are good to go."
1,very disappointed,"i ordered this item in november 2005 and still have not recieved my bundle me, this item is at target. in stock. if you want the jjcole bundle me i would highly recomend getting it else where. my experience has been very unsatisfactory. my baby is already 2 months old and could have used the bundle me considering i live in upstate new york where the winters are very cold and bitter. i have seen the bundle me and think it is a wonderful product. i just wish amazon would ship me my order. mean while they are tying up my money and will not let me cancel my order because of an order error. if i could cancel my order i would go to target and purchase my bundle me but amazon will not refund my money or even worse cancel my order. think twice before you order!"
5,excellent product for cold winters,no more struggling with blankets getting caught in the carseat base or dragging on the ground. This is a fantastic product.
5,I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!11,"My husband and I love this product. We have a 5 point hardness and it works great with it. My son is always comfortable a cozy, and we love that if it gets too warm we can take the top off or unzip it a little more so he is never overheated. We love it so much we plan on buying the toddle one as he get bigger."
5,Makes traveling easy,I purchased this product when I started having to haul baby around in the winter months. It is easy to use and allows you to quickly get baby ready without putting on a whole other outfit. We just throw on a hat and sometimes and folded blanket under the top flap for extra warmth and go. Works well for us.
5,Infant must have!,"Love this bundle me, I used it all winter last year, and have purchased the toddler one for this year. Easy to clean, just unzip blanket and wash, and very easy to install.Velcro openings hold harness in place, and no more dirty blankets dragging on the floor."
4,WORK OK,"I DON'T DO A WHOLE LOT OF DOUBLE CD RECORDINGS. ONE CD WILL HOLD A LOT OF MUSIC DEPENDING ON WHAT TYPE OF MUSIC IT IS. THESE WORKED OK FOR WHAT I NEEDED THEM FOR. THEY ARE SOMEWHAT AWKWARD TO OPEN AT TIMES, AND THE JEWEL CASE COVERS GET MESSED UP WHEN YOU DO OPEN THEM SOMETIMES."
2,How do you remove the CDs form the trays?,"Bought a package of ten and probably will not use them due to the extremely tightfit of the trays. Tried pushing the middle in, pulling on the CD edges (not a good move).CDs nicely snap in but have fun getting them out of the trays. Perhaps it is me but I triedmany ways to safely complete the task. I gave up and ate the transaction.I will never buys these again."
3,So-so,"The quality of these jewel cases is so-so at best. I bought them to transfer my double CD albums to take up less space in my CD rack. I was expecting the same high quality case that you get when you purchase a double CD album. But these aren't them. The plastic is thinner, all around. Therefore they aren't as stiff, so the CD booklet you might put into them causes the case to bulge. Also on the spine there were sharp edges. I took a nail file and tried to file them smooth, with only slight improvement. If I had known they were of lesser quality before I purchased them I might still have bought them, but then at least I could've lowered my expectations."
1,These will crack your CD's!!!,"I've purchased these double CD cases before. The problem is that the center piece is too big for the CD. As a result, you end up forcing the CD onto the piece, which in turn creates cracks starting at the center of the CD in various places!! I have a pile of CD's now that I have to reburn because of these cheaply made cases. STAY AWAY!"
2,Service OK,"Shipping was fast but some of the cases appeared to not be new or they were scuffed, one was broken at the hinge. The packaging was not good at all. i kept them because I needed them or I probably would have sent them back. But again, the shipping was fast. Would still order from you again. Things happen."
5,Good Quality!,"Finally, dual CD cases that actually work! I had trouble with all the ones I bought before. For example, I had ones that clung too hard that I was concerned they would crack the CD as I was taking it out. These ones from Fellows are just right."
1,Where is it?,"Ordered 50 jewel cases from J&R. Sent me an entirely different item than ordered, sent me a case for an Ipod. Called them told me they would send me a label to return and to take it to ups. They told me they would not ship out correct item until they got their item back. She graciously told me they no longer had a 50 pack but they would send me two 25's at no additional cost. Ordered this item more than a week before Christmas have received no notification of shipping and of course no item.( I sent item back as instructed right after Christmas)"
4,Only one case out of 30 was damaged,"I tend to agree with Miss Griswold that J&R; should do a better job of packing these things. In my case, I ordered a total of 30 CD cases (3 packages of 10). I have only discovered one cracked case so far. It was a small crack too.I would also add that these CD cases have a cheap feel to them. I've seen better."
3,Just okay,"These cases are just okay. I have a lot of Maxell double CD cases, but I've had trouble finding them, so I bought these. They don't grip the CDs quite strong enough, so the CDs sometimes fall off, and the centerpiece tends to snag the paper label on the back of the case. If you're just storing CDs, these will work fine, but if you want to access your CDs regularly, they aren't that great."
4,Double jewel cases,"The procudt was as advertised, at a reasonable price, and delivered in a timely manner."
5,Well-organized video for all,"If you are sociology student or just trying to explore more knowledge on society and human interactions, this is the best video for you. The videos give you insight on the way we live, how society is organized, family structure,racial inequality, wemen's right, civil right,and many other relavants topics covered in colleges and universities today. It is 22 video lesson, very entertaining, and it featured real life scenerio.The video cover various interviews with experts, sociologists and other historians. I do recommend this DVD set for students who may no have enough time to read those bulking textbook and who just want to have some knowledge in sociology."
1,Really not that useful,"We found this book more annoying than helpful. It includes the words for many songs, but not the music, so if you don't know the tune, you can't sing the songs. The recommendations for infants didn't include anything we hadn't thought of before.We much preferred Baby Days."
5,A great resource idea book!,I get a TON of ideas from Wonderplay by Fretta Reitzes. I'm a home daycare provider and I'm always looking for ideas to do with my daycare kids. I don't know what I would do with out this book. It'a MUST have for home daycare providers and parents of small kids
2,Not really worth it,"This book is just barely okay. There are only a couple ideas that even come close to being original. Also, there isn't much explanation of any suggestion. Skip buying the book and do some brain-storming. You will come up with everything in there."
5,great book,"this is a great book. It gives great ideas to ""play"" with your baby. This book is also good for caregivers or librarians."
1,not all that creative,"I have to agree with some other reviews, that it wasn't all that creative. I was hoping for more inventive ways to have fun with my toddler, but was sadly disappointed. Thankfully I also got the Toddler Busy Book, which was WAY more helpful and I use that ALL the time."
2,a little disappointing,"i really decided to buy this book because i wanted to find some activities i could do with my child that would help his development. but i was disappointed to find out that there was like 3 pages of stuff for children ages 0 to 6 months. this book was advertised as having stuff from birth to toddler, it shouldn't have misled people about what was in the book. i mean all there is for under 6 months is some rhymes and a couple of activities. i thought there was going to be some stuff about activities to help them reach their developmental milestones. i mean their are probably not many people that don't know the few rhymes and games that are in the book."
3,Want it to be longer,"I bought this for my son who wants to be an inventor. It was very imformative and given at the appropriate age level. However, when the video ended my son asked me if that was all. Even though the information provide was excellent, I suggest that other people take into consideration that it is short and general knowledge your child my already know."
5,A Ball of Love & Rockets,"This was great I thought it was a wonderful trip back into retro land and left room for the newer tracks(included).The videos feature on this dvd is almost the same videos I use to record onto vhs when they did get airplay on the video media channels.Actually to watch the Hunted Fishtank,The bubblemen video, and the solo videos was an added bonus. Watching the evolution of Love and Rockets was even better because watching a band grow is always a personalized treat.The gift that keeps on giving Sorted Best Love & Rockets."
5,Finally!,"This whole collection rocks! -Haunted Fish Tank: this program is so gosh darn funny.- Take the advice of the men from Bauhaus/Tones On Tail/Love And Rockets: DON'T ROCK, WOBBLE."
5,THE FIRST CHAPTER WILL [horrify] YOU!,"This is a great wrap up of serial killer John Wayne Gacy. I absolutely was riveted to the story. I couldn't believe how sick this [man] was. Thank goodness he is gone. There was nothing redeeming about his Life.Cahill, the author did a wonderful job making his life story seem so real feeling as I read.I will say the first chapter was so gross, what with the describing the little red worms in the soil in the crawl space. (Shivering) highly recommended"
5,Highly disturbing but one of the best true crime books,"I have read many a true crime story and this is the top of the draw. The amount of detail brings to mind IN COLD BLOOD and THE ULTIMATE EVIL. Cahill, instead of rushing to print like Cliff Linedecker, has really placed you inside the sick mind of John Gacy; it will disgust, shock, frighten, and, curiously enough, please you with how well written it is. It will make you feel unclean but you keep on flippin pages. If you can manage to find a copy of this book, get it. I had originally gotten a paperback but had to replace it with a finer hardcover edition. ORDER THIS-NO REGRETS HERE!!!"
3,good parts,this book is not too bad it has some good parts but it also has some slow parts that drag on and on.
2,Irritating read,"The way this book is written, using John Wayne Gacy's own words and multiple lies in a conversational form, gets to be both tedious and irritating. I've read over 200 books in this true crime genre and this is only about the third one that I've set aside before I finished it.No doubt Gacy was an interesting character and the book, as much of it I read which was about half, does make that point quite well. But listening to his lies being repeated endlessly (Gacy was a real talker) is disruptive to not only the inner ear but also to the story."
4,Buried Dreams,"Is an excellent read. I have read many books on John Gacy. I find that this one goes more into detail of what John Gacy actually felt about his crimes and the manipulation games he played with the police and society in general. It is well written and proceeds in a logical sequence. Although very sad to read about the ""crime time"" it does not continously dwell on it, more so on Gacy himself. I would recommend this to any true crime reader."
5,Scary book!,"Bought this book in paperback many years ago but it got lost in the shuffle of moving or someone borrowed it and never returned it. Was looking online for some books and ran across this one and just had to buy it. Gacy was a real freak! Very scary man. A real monster. His last words were : ""Kiss my ass!"" 33 young men died at his hand. I hope he enjoys hell!"
3,Not really worth the money,"I purchased this powder from a beauty supply store thinking it was some kind of special powder made for body waxing. It's not, it's just unscented talcum powder. You can use any talcum powder you like, it doesn't have to be a brand name.That being said, powder is a must have when using soft waxes. It makes a big difference and it's worth the extra step. But unless this goes on sale, just get any store brand baby powder and save some money."
4,good buy,"Works very well to use before waxing. Just need a little bit so it goes a long way. Some of the pre and post waxing products seem unnecessary, but I would recommend this!"
3,Good,It really helps with smoothing and degreasing the skin. I highly reccomend this product to anyone with sensitive and or oily skin
2,Makes no sense!,I used this as directed and the wax sticks on my legs still...don't know what to do? Maybe I'm doing st wrong? But I think not...
5,Great movie. Kids loved it.,I got this movie four days ago. We have seen it about 5 times. Sometimes twice in a row.Boys are 6 and 4. I think that says it all.
4,Sweet R 'n B,"""honey to the bee"" 16 year old Billie's 4th UK single, is possibly one of my favorite tracks from her album, also labeled Honey to the B. The song is getting rave reviews, loads of people saying it ""smothers like Madonna"" or something like that. Well, I dunno about Madonna, but Billie has produced a wonderful R 'n B single sure to beat the socks off of Britney Spears and the likes. This song is fab! Be sure to check out Billie's other singles and her album too!"
5,No llores Mis Recuerdos,"the words in this song, are similar to my life, and how it is now. My life is stable at this time."
2,"THIS ITEM ARE NOT WHAT I EXPECTED, WANT TO RETURN IT","THIS ITEMS WAS NOT LIKE WHAT I SAW ON THE PICTURES BEFORE ORDERING, THEREFORE I WOULD LIKE TO RETURN THIS ITEMS PLEASE, INTRUCT ME HOW."
2,Reticule broke within 2 months,"Read all of the good reviews and liked the scope initially. Seemed like a good value for an inexpensive scope. It was mounted on a Marlin 795 22 but while shooting the bottom reticule broke. Not sure how that could be since I thought they were etched into the glass, but the bottom line is now significantly shifted to the right. It will cost me about half the price of a new one to get it fixed or replaced by Simmons. Too late to send it back to Amazon."
4,not a bad scope,"First of all eye relief is around 20"" or so and you can't adjust it. I shoot it on my Volquartsen/Ruger Mark III competition pistol. It looks great and performs well at 50 to 100 yards. I guess for the money it is a good product from Simmons. I would have given it 5 stars, but it has to be dead center of eye to see clear crosshair... Get a good set of scope rings as it doesn't come with any. I have attached a picture of my pistol with the scope mounted"
3,Two planes of focus issue,"Ok for a rimfire scope except that it cannot be in crisp focus on a target and the crosshairs at the same time. At 35 yards, it is very obvious - crosshairs are almost invisible. At 100 yards, with the target crsiply focused, the crosshairs are blurred. None of my quality scopes do this (Leopold, Nikon), and I don't notice this even in a cheepie Barska 3x9."
3,Nice scope but awful rings,Its a nice scope for the money. Its for a .22 rifle so don't expect an amazing scope. Reticle is clear. Has nice eye relief too. This scope does come with rings but they are really bad. After 50 rounds of steady shooting the rings loosen and slide on the mount as well as on the scope it self. The screws for the rings were a joke. Even with the proper size screwdriver the screw head was deforming. So my advice is to not use the rings and get some better ones.
3,Nice but does not fit all 22's,"I purchased this for my marlin 22 mag bolt action model 0.25M. The bolt hits the scope alittle and I have to use it on my other gun or get higher rings. Nice scope for the price, but at 8x magnification it gets alittle blurry at closer ranges."
3,Rings do not fit.,"The Scope is just what I was looking for. Nice quality, not to expensive, looks good, and easy to sight in. The scope does come with mounting rings but this is were the problems arose. The rings would not fit on my rifle, I tried two different mounting platforms and they were both to big. The rings appear as if they were designed for a air rifle. I was disappointed, I know need to order a pair of rings that will fit on my rifle."
5,"nice scoop, sighted in very easily.",very happy so far with this scope. Easy to sight in and comes with mounting rings. Once sighted in I was able to keep shoots in a 1 in. circle at 30yds and at 50yds about a 1 1/2 in. circle.
5,Great Price for the Features,I bought this for a Marlin 60 and wanted a good name that I could count on and that would hold up for years to come.The free shipping from Amazon made this the place to purchase it. The eye relief distance is really nice and target acquisition is pretty quick. If I need another scope for a rimfire rifle...this will be it!
2,Hard to see through,Based on the reviews i bought this but i find myself constantly adjusting my eye to see through this scope properly.If my eye is not centered just right i cant see anything .I would not buy this again.
2,fair scope,"Got scope in june. Have about 2500 rounds down range. Sighted in fine and holds zero on my 10 22 ruger (.22lr). Lately I have noticed one of the crosshairs is falling off recticle. No big deal is the vertical axis. My only big gripe is the + / - focus on the eyepiece keeps changing so you have to reset it every mag or 2 (i.e. 10 -20 rounds). More of an annoyance than anything. Note it is a cheap scope with fairly clear lenses. 2 stars for these reasons 1) failing crosshairs, 2)pain in my a** eyepiece magnifier."
3,Cross hairs not adjustable,"I purchased the scope for my new Ruger 1022. I purchased the 1022 scope mounts, but they did not work as well as what came with the Simmons scope. I mounded the scope, but could not get the crosshairs to move at all. I am not an expert, so not sure why they did not operate and allow me to adjust. I had a laser barrel sight for accuracy, but that was no good since I could not get a scope adjustment by turning either windage or elevation."
5,Great buy.,Great value for the money. Easy to change the settings with the knob handles and the quick acquisition eye piece is a nice feature.
2,A disappointment,"This is the first Simmons scope I have ever ordered. It seemed like it would be ideal for my new full-stocked Ruger 10-22, however, I could not get it to adjust correctly with my laser bore sighter. I gave up on it and replaced it with a $20.00 Barska Colorado 3x9x40 which adjusted perfectly and had clearer optics. I bought another 10-22 as a gift and tried the Simmons again and with quite a bit of effort was able to get it boresighted. The adjustment is very ""mushy"" and is tough to set. Time will tell whether it will actually work. Conclusion: No more Simmons scopes for me!"
1,Amazon Description Wrong - not AO,"For anyone looking for a scope with an Adjustable Objective (AO), this is not it. The description says this scope is AO and the parallax is adjustable on this model but it's wrong.The AO model with adjustable parallax is Simmons Part #511072, this is Simmons Part #511039. I ordered this scope a couple of days ago and had to return it."
1,originator,"My wife, Rebecca, is the source of this book. Marilyn and Becky co-wrote it in our living room over several months with Rebecca as the main source of reference. I made many pots of tea as they spread upon the floor and wrote down what they had experienced. Angie Murdock was also a major influence. Ruth Mitchell's name got stuck on this by sheer political nonsense. She had nothing to do with writing, theory or research."
3,"Good instrument, except for intonation.","I was pleased with the timbre of the instrument and the action of the keys, but about 1/3 of the keys were noticeably out of tune. (I used a chromatic violin tuner to test the pitch of every reed) This wouldn't have been an issue if the instrument was in decent relative tune with itself, but the some notes were right on the correct pitch while others differed as much as 30 cents from the correct pitch. That being said, it isn't impossible to tune melodicas, just very laborious. Everything else about the instrument, case, and accessories was satisfactory."
2,Maybe it Was Just a Defective Melodica.,"Excited to purchase a Melodica after hearing one played, I looked online and found this one. It had great reviews and looked promising. Shortly after opening the box I was disappointed, several keys were slightly out of tune and any chord sounded bad. It took huge amounts of air to play more than a single note. The high F does not work and the high C barely produces a sound. The other keys work fine for producing single note melody lines but overall i'm disappointed. Maybe I just got a defective Melodica."
4,Decent,"Plastic melodica, feels a bit cheap (as was expected). Sounds fine, keys all work and seem in tune. Not going to find better for the price. Holds it's own in jams with more expensive instruments no problem."
2,out of tune,"I went with this because of positive reviews, price, and reputable brand name. It's the last time I'll buy an instrument online. Some of the notes were in tune, but really, all of them need to be in good tune, or it's no fun to play. The sound was nice, the case was lovely, everything else was great- but tuning is crucial. I suspect other reviewers either only played single-note melodies and didn't notice how out of tune it is, or lucked out and got instruments that weren't as bad as this one. I returned it and am now looking for one I can test first in a real store."
4,Very practical,"I purchased this melodica a month ago, and I definitely don't regret it.I've never been passionate about melodica's sound, but we all should agreethat is is a very practical instrument.It is easy to carry, and you could get a nice sound if add some reverb to it in your recordings.It came in a beautiful black case but the first C is quite sharp. That's the only thing that disappointed me. The rest of the notes are well tuned.I recommend it."
5,Sweet!,"I'm very happy with this melodica. The sound is great, the action is nice, and the case is good quality. Oh and the price is perfect."
1,Fatally Out of Tune,"I read other reviews and knew that the tuning might be an issue but was surprised at how out of tune it really is. Tuning ranges from -5 to +15 cents over and under standard tuning (C=440). Playing a G major chord sounds like nails on a chalkboard. I'm looking into tuning it myself, but it seems like a laborious and potentially destructive task. I'm disappointed."
2,ignore the picture,"i ordered this cause i saw some1 playing it and i liked the sound.THe guy played the Hohner 32 student melodica and this shows the picture of that.- Instead they send me a different Melodica.. ""instructor"" 32... Its ok for $40 but not what i thought i was getting"
3,"Bush on War, Terrorism, and Freedom...","2003's ""We Will Prevail"" is a compendium of President George Bush's public speeches in the first two years of the Global War On Terrorism. Put together by National Review, it features minimal commentary in the form of a short foreword by Peggy Noonan and an equally short introduction by Jay Nordlinger, both veteran Republican speech-writers.Bush's controversial presidency won't get a serious non-partisan review for years, if not decades. A quick scan of the reviews associated with this book indicates the huge span of current opinion. Only time will tell whether Bush's policies will ultimately work for the best. Nevertheless, the speeches captured here will be a resource for future biographers, some of whom may decide that Bush was a more effective public speaker than he is usually given credit for being."
1,Give me a break!,"Reading these words was actually painful. You can almost hear the hypocrisy behind every insincere phrase. Just a book to make money - nothing new, enlightening or truthful here - sadly."
3,Informative,"While I tend to lean to a more liberal worldview I believe that is necessary to know where the president of our country, his administration, his PR department, and his speechwriters stand.Whatever one may believe about the President's policies, it is impossible to deny that the man is not an eloquent speaker. This is no fault of his own, though it does give impression that he is unintelligent. This is an underestimation by anyone on both sides of the fence. If you want to remove Bush from power, the best place to start is to ""know your enemies""."
1,Don't waste your money,I can't believe I wasted my money on this book. It's exactly what you'd expect. Copy/paste any of his speeches and you can make the same book.
1,I don't know about that ...,"If this guy is so into the survival, or, as he would say, the ""prevalation"" of America, how come you can carry scissors on airplanes again? Is he so sure it's just high-income Republican-voting ladies who HAVE to cut their nails enroute? What's to stop some more gangs from our Saudi ally from taking over an airliner? And how come you can STILL bring containerized freight into just about any American port, unchecked? In spite of what (Republican) Mr. Kean may say about it? How come this prevalator has allowed Alqaeda to enter Iraq? That little stinker, Saddam Hussein (his daddy's ally), had been doing a pretty good job at keeping them out. And how come the Pakistanis STILL have the ""Islamic Bomb""? Who do you think that bomb is going to be used on?I don't know how free we'll be, with George ""Patriot Act"" Bush Jr. around, but Little George sure has a different idea of how to ""prevalate"" than anybody I ever met."
3,"Good picture, but not very reliable","I had this TV for about 2 and 1/2 years, and the picture just went blank. The TV shuts itself down after few seconds. I had a local TV repair service take a look at the problem, and he said that I need a new tube. He said he would do it for $1,200. I like the over all picture quality and the design of the TV set, but having the tube last only 2 and 1/2 years is not acceptable. I'm very disappointed at the reliability of Sony TV."
3,Sony doesn't stand behind product.,"Enjoyed my new tv for 17 months, give it the highest ratings. Then the picture went black. Sony said you should of brought the extended warranty. After paying $2400.00 for a sony tv (the best brand on the market or so I thought) why should I need a warranty. The dealer has had the tv for 3 weeks. They want $248.00 for trouble shooting and now they say they still can't fix it, need a new board for $300.00 Total of $548.00, plus the $50.00 we already gave them. Was ready to buy one like it for the bedroom, not anymore."
1,"Problem with Sony 36"" XBR HDTV","I purchased a sony 36"" XBR in June 2002. Almost after a year, the TV is giving me problems. Sometimes there is no picture, but audio is fine. After waiting for a day or two without turning ON the TV, it would magically turn on and after working for few hours, the picture will vanish but audio is fine.Its very disgusting to know that after paying a good decent price for a SONY TV, I would have to face such a problem and that too almost in a year of purchase."
1,Worse TV Ever- Will never buy Sony again,TV worked great for first 18 months and now picture goes black after 1 hour of viewing. Warranty is only for 1 year. Can't find tech able to fix it. Really heavy to move too!
2,Sony XBR TV dies twice Picture perfect when it worked,"I got the Sony KV36XBR450 in March 2002 It only had the 2 year Sony warrenty. Did not think I would need an exteded warrenty having bought several Sony TVs over the years.It lasted only 2 years 11 months.(2-2005) It would try to turn on then shut down and only the red light in front would bink 4 times and repeat. I had it serviced $419, and it worked fine until 12-23-05 9 monthts after the repair,when it did the same thing. No sound no picture. Now I have to decied to throw more money at it or throw out this two hundred an thirty-eight pound paperwight."
1,Huge disappointment,"I bought what was supposewd to be the best. After 2 years, i am having problems with the set turning itself off after a brief time. Local technicians say this is a common problem, but don't seem to know how to fix it. I'll never buy another Sony."
3,"Beautiful Picture, but Heavy, and Serious Problem after 4 years","I purchased this TV in June of 2002. About August of 2006, it started to have intermittent problems of displaying a distorted output of the selected input along with parts of the output of the second tuner. Would come and go, normally after the TV had been on for a little while. Makes it impossible to watch TV when this is happening. I've been told by service company to expect $500 repair bill.When working, the picture is beautiful. This set is very heavy, about 235 pounds, which presents challenges in getting it serviced. No one wants to move it."
3,"Good picture, but board went out after only 3 years","I've enjoyed the picture quality of television but noticed perhaps a year after I bought it that it turned off every once in a while. It didn't happen that often so I basically overlooked it for a while. Then after a couple of years it got to the point where it turned off more frequently until I had to replace the board which cost me a little over $300. I've had other televisions for much longer without any maintenance at all. Aside from that I've definitely enjoyed the picture, but I would expect any television that costs so much to be more reliable."
1,Great Picture...When It Works,I guess I should consider myself lucky. My TV lasted 5 years before the problems started. No video but the audio works. It happens randomly. I paid $500 to get it fixed and three months later the problem was back. I beginning to think that Sony bought a faulty component from a 3rd party because I bought a similar sized Samsung HD tube TV for my mother-in-law and after 6 years it's has the exact same problem.
4,Sony KV-36XBR450 is Great But has Flaws,"I've had this television set for about six years now. The picture quality is great, but anyone who has this television knows that it has problems. I have two problems mine; one is that it powers itself off when warm and the other is that the monitor (picture) won't turn on sometimes. My set has been repaired numerous times - I have had the power supply circuit and capacitors replaced. The total cost for all the repairs were about $750.These defects are likely to be engineering design flaws, one in which Sony should have corrected through testing (if they do any at all). The technology in Sony product is great and Sony claims that ""we stand by our product"" but I have yet to see any of their product lasts in the long run."
2,don't get this for the DIY porta booth,"I bought this when I was building a Harlan porta booth. His site had warned against using the 'cheap stuff' now I know why. This stuff is visibly less dense than the name-brand foam. It did very little to dampen ambient sounds in my office/recording area. I found an old panel of the real stuff in a closet. It was just enough to bend in a U shape around the mic in the box over this cheap foam. That actually made a noticable difference. Now I'm going to pay the extra money to fill the top and bottom with the expensive foam. Instead of saving a buck, I wasted time and $27 on this stuff."
5,50 was the last COOL album; Hank is still a force,"He can cover songs or write them. The title track and his tribute to Waylon make this worth the money. The rest is just gravy. Maybe there's a little corn in the gravy, but it's the best in a long time!gailordtaylord@yahoo.com"
3,Some beguiling photos,"Especially the cover...but not very deep.BTW, it's ""TURN ON, TUNE IN, DROP OUT""! Not ""Tune in, Turn on, Drop out"". It amazes me how many books on the 60s get this wrong. And splash it across two pages. Even Leary's bio ( IHAS ) got it wrong. I mean, just logically, you must turn something on before you can tune it in. No wonder folks think we are crazy! The Fugs wrote a great song--""To, Ti, Do"" ( abbreviated by me ). Any real 60s vet would remember that. You can read Dr. Leary's explanation here:[...]There are other goofs in here as well. But the book is still worth it for a sort of general overview of the world-wide mayhem current at the time. Yes it was great.""Memoirs of a Taos Hippie"", ""Be Not Content"" ( maybe the best but good luck finding one for less than $150 ), and ""Ringolevio"" will put you right there."
1,"Soulless, dull.","What is supposed to be a celebration of / tribute to hippies and 60s counter-culture turned out more like a soulless, dull chronology of drug busts punctuated by lackluster quotes about LSD and illustrated with photographs that are tantalizing yet unexplained, therefore contextually irrelevant. I wanted more about the human condition."
5,Hippie,"Hippie by Barry Miles *****One of the greatest and most interesting coffee table books in history. Hippie is bright with vibrant pictures of the hippie movement, which in this book is depicted as more than just a small gathering in San Francisco, California in the mid to late 1960's, but something that was much bigger and basically covered the entire globe.Packed with great and intelligent quotes from those who were actually there. Interesting bits that some may not realized were in connection to the movement and what a massive impact they had on the world. Intelligently written showing both the goods the movement did as well as the bad. Both sides of the fence are shown, those who were for the movement and those against. Barry Miles is one of the worlds best biographers and Hippie is just another trophy on his wall. Highly recommended."
3,"Great photos, Good Quotes, ""Blah"" text","First of all, the 3 stars are all for the pictures in this book, which are excellent. I love the layout of the book and the design is great. The photos have great colour and context. There are a lot of great quotes from important people of the era as well. I think really what's lacking here is the actual text of it. None of the articles are really that great or in-depth and you don't come out of it feeling like you learned much, sorry. That's what disappoints me about this book, especially since i didn't get to actually LIVE in that era."
2,"Blah,Blah,Woof,Woof","Pretty worthless unless your picture is in it (mine wasn't) and there wasn't enough skin to compensate. But then there wasn't as much skin and sex in the 60s as the media and gov't. feared back then. But one must maintain the status quo, mustn't one? Of course, if one is wealthy enough to purchase coffee table mags and have the classy coffee tables to put them on...maybe one just missed the whole point of the 60s.So sorry"
5,Amazing,"More space is devoted to pictures than words, and both the pictures and words are well chosen and convey the '60's superbly. This book should be used for high school history classes... but then there's too much drugs, sex and R&R for the stuffed shirts running the schools..."
3,B positive,"3 1/2Jones offers an impressive array of neo-bop work here and plenty of proof for leadership ability, but can't quite seal the deal on all-around excellence despite genre expertise; ever present grunts don't help either."
3,Got the job done,The book was required for me at school. Showed up in time and in good shape. Some differences with what the instructors taught though.
1,First Responder textbook/workbook,"I was unhappy with this purchase because I specifically typed in TEXTBOOK, not student workbook. I went ahead and ordered the product, expecting TEXTBOOKS. Imagine my surprise when I received WORKBOOKS and did not have enough time to try again to order textbooks before the class began. I don't plan to order class supplies through Amazon again."
1,This one is DOA,"If you are looking for a good EMT book, I would take my business over to the Brady series. Did the editor actually look at this thing? I would have to say no! Forget about it, move on."
1,Agree - poor quality,I agree with the other reviewer here. One side failed to work after a couple months of what I would consider very light use. The other is now starting to fail intermittently.
1,Garbage,Very flat and tinny sound -- so I wouldn't recommend this unless you plan on using these mainly for talk radio or spoken-word podcasts. Otherwise these are very cheaply made. My pair developed a loose connection in one earbud after ~1 month of gentle use and I discarded them. Not worth it.
4,A Classic That Still Speaks To Us Today,"Norman Vincent Peale speaks to troubled souls with words of encouragement in Christ Jesus. Using stories from people in his life, he tells how faith brings the hope we need. Though the book reminds us of a time gone by fifty years ago, the human needs it speaks to are still crucial to us today. Read it as a devotional a chapter at a time, or enjoy it straight through as a tonic of hope for a better life. You will most likely want to read it over and over."
2,"Proofreaders, where are you?","The April Woo series has become a favorite of mine, but The kindle version of The Silent Bride is so filled with typographical errors that it becomes difficult to follow the story line. It became a game trying to figure out what a word should have been. Lack of editing cost the book two stars."
1,I don't recommend this drive or any Pacific Digital product,"Despite having all the system requirements, my pc started to freeze after installing this drive. Every time I turned on the drive, I had to reboot and lost everything. I tried calling Pacific Digital, but you can't actually get through to talk to someone. It asks you to leave a voice mail on a machine and I didn't get a call back until after I had already gotten so frustrated I returned the drive. Their online support is unhelpful too. They claim to have an online chat available, but the hours are limited and try as you may, you can never actually get through during those hours. I will never buy Pacific Digital again!"
1,Shipping wt 35 lbs?????,"Almost bought this thing, as I own a 928. But then spotted the shipping weight. 35 pounds???? Is it made of Uranium?? What's it packed in, a lead bar? The toy itself weighs a few ounces."
2,Should be more sturdy and hold the stand too.,"We bought the Weber Q plus the rolling stand because it was portable for our RV. We also bought the rolling duffle under the impression it would hold the stand AND the grill. When we got it home we discovered it would only hold the grill, not the grill along with the stand. If it had about 5-6 more square inches of room it would hold both and would package up nicely to be stored away when traveling to and from home in our RV. I also agree with the person who wrote that it should be more sturdy."
3,Its OK but should be cheaper for the quality,The bag its a little too big for the grill Q220. I think it should be more fitted to the grill. When you roll it I feel that the grill just moves around with more of a chance to break. If I knew the grill was going to fit loose in there I would not have bought it. I think the price its a little high for the quality. I guess you are paying for the Weber name.
2,Would be great if it didn't have so many problems...,"I think this program would be great, but it kept freezing up, made multiple copies of the same picture some how, and the categorization of pictures didn't seem to make sense.I think it definitely has potential, but needs a little fine tuning."
1,Photo Finale,"We ordered this product to make a slideshow for our wedding. I don't know if we got a bad program or not, we were unable to add music to it like we should've been we got errors and it closed the program out. We send it to the manufactor for a refund."
2,Soft Ware,"This soft ware had a big build up but my computer came with photo software on it, poor product."
5,adorable dogs,"this pups are so cute!plus they are so real. I want them all!I would save up my money for these puppies.thats my advice to all kids.boys,girls,women and men."
2,Boring toy... even for a dog lover!,"After my 5 year old got this in her hands, we filled out the Adoption papers and named him. That was pretty much it for this toy. It whines so much that she has asked me how to turn it off. It is supposed to whine when you pet it, but it is very sensitive and whines if you walk by it. There is no redeeming value to this toy other than being a stuffed animal. Save your money and just buy a stuffed dog and name it."
1,this is not a very good toy,"I just bought this today and this toy is this only entertains you for 5 minutes and after that five minutes is up you will be bored Ido not get this toy get a care-bear cub instead people!!! ps this only wines,moves head back and forth,and wags tail"
2,Nabakov is not a literary critic,"I got this because a former student was using it in a class. It's a collection of lectures Nabokov gave at Wellesley, where he taught for some years. Hard to imagine, but this excellent 20th century novelist was a very poor lecturer with (to me) a fairly naive critical eye. He goes on and on, for example, about the ""genius"" of RLS and Jekyll & Hyde, then dismisses Joyce's Ulysses with ""he was a good writer."" All in all, not a book for your Nabokov collection."
5,great american novel,"The Round Barn takes us back to the days of the great american novel by authors of the past. Ms. Wizowati really gets the characters lives of their own and tells a good story too. Very few novels stay with you long after reading, this one does. I think we will be hearing from this author for a long time to come."
3,Written and edited by functional illiterates,"This book has been written and edited by functional illiterates who have trouble with tense, number, etc. Many of the references to figures, etc. are incorrect. Several of the C language examples are incorrect. On the other hand it has information I've not been able to find anywhere else."
1,NOT VERY GOOD,BOUGHT THIS FOR BAD TASTING WATER WHILE CAMPING IN RV. BEEN CAMPING 4 TIMES WATER STILL TASTE BAD EVERY TIME.
1,Not worth the price,Another tedious listing of the differences between different types of firearms. Brings nothing new to the table.
2,Hardware overview,"As many reviewers have said before, this book is not about handgun defense. Rather, there is some interesting information about the technical and historical aspects of handgunning. This is very odd, given the title of the book and the notion that the author makes in the book stating that tactics are more important than tools. Still, he concentrates almost exclusively on hardware.The book is well written and interesting to read, but if you are looking for a book about effective handgun defense, don't buy Effective Handgun Defense."
2,Misleading Title,"Whoever decided to title this book ""Effective Handgun Defense"" must have been reading a different book.While an interesting read, it is less about what I was looking for (information on Handgun Defense... go figure) and more about things I already knew (differences in calibers), found somewhat interesting if irrelevant (history of gunfighting), or the completely bizarre (rules for being a gunfighter???).So yeah, 1 part useful information that would fall under the category of the books title and 9 parts ramblings of someone who may have a little too much lead in his blood.If you're looking for information about what you should know/learn/do prior to getting a conceal carry permit, or a guide to how to better increase your competency with a defensive handgun then this is not the book for you.So far 'The Concealed Handgun Manual: How to choose, carry, and shoot in self defense' has been the closest to what I'm looking for."
2,Not really a book on how to defend yourself with a handgun.,"While I enjoyed a lot of the book, I bought it to learn how to effectively defend myself with a handgun. If that's what you want, skip this book and get the Gun Digest Book of Concealed Carry, or the Gun Digest Book of Handgunnery. I feel that I was misled by the title."
2,Misleading Title - Comprehensive Guide To Conceal Carry,"The book title is very deceiving. I bought this book because the author has high praises for the CZ75b combat pistol, which I own. The author goes into detail into the historical origins of today's pistols. This book depicts highly desirable pistols and calibers, and some tips on how to select a good holster and concealment. It does not describe any type of gun handling or pistol shooting. Although the author describes felt recoil on various calibers.For me, effective handgun defense should cover awareness, weapon concealment, drawing, and using the pistol. The author only covers one of these four areas. I would have given this book more stars if the title was different."
2,Jewelry Making by Tim McCreight,"While this book has a great deal of viable information, I found it a bit cumbersome to follow along without the addition of illustration, photos or other diagrams to illustrate the techniques being taught. I personally find it much easier to learn a technique when there are visual references to corresond with the steps.All in all, it seemed a bit outdated compared to the other instructional books on the market."
3,Rare view of this time in history,"Positive side: Rare view of this time in history.Negative: Not very well written, but the young woman was not a professional writer so makes sense. It is best seen as a descriptive diary.Negative: The font and printing is difficult for me to read. Came close to giving me a headache each time I picked it up to read. Always seemed 'kind of blotchy"" and the letters would run together.All in all, if you have a real interest in this place and time period it is worth the read. If you are looking for a well written story - look elsewhere."
4,down the Santa De Trail and Into Mexico,I liked the historic significance. A true accounting of a perilous journey and a hard but normal life for travelers in that area.
2,Washes off too easily,"The selection of colors is good, I would just put green in the large compartment, since it is usually the most important color. The case is flimsy, so if you are going to have it on you while you low crawl and/or combat roll, it will break. Having the mirror is nice but it does not stay in place and gets messed up in paint.Now the most important part: paint itself is easy to apply and provides decent coverage, however it is extremely vulnerable to water and you can wipe it off with your hand. If you plan on actually using it as a camouflage you will have to reapply it every couple hours, because it literally drops from your face with sweat. Also if your face is already sweaty it's much harder to apply it. And if you put the gas mask on, you can say bye-bye to your face paint.Overall, it is useless as a camouflage, but it might be good for kids - easy to apply and clean, 4 colors let you make some cool schemes and it should last for a while."
5,camo face paint,"Great camo make up! Easy on - creamy and goes on and blends easy. Comes off with just water, which is nice as well."
4,Perfect,This worked really well for my kids Halloween costumes. The makeup was easy to apply and came off with little effort.
5,A Sexy Page Turner,"SPIES LIES AND LOVERS is a fast-paced, delicious book that absolutely drips sexual tension, featuring a heroine with enough guts for three men. Tip: if you miss the handcuffs scene, you'll be sorry!"
5,Great Prose and Characters,"I have trouble staying with a book all the way through, but ""Spies, Lies and Lovers"" really grabbed me and didn't let go. It is a very fun and thrilling read. The characters are real and the descriptions of their thoughts are very well written. The flow of action is vivid. The story is very sexy - without being crude. My highest compliments to Ms. Hayes. She is a truly great writer! I am an aspiring writer, and I have honed my skills from reading her prose. I am going to order and read all her works. Keep up the good work!"
2,Works great out of the box but it has a short lifespan.,"The SMC EZ6506TX, like all switches, is pretty much a no-brainer piece of computer equipment - you plug the cables from your computers into the switch and it just works (even easier with this switch since you can also use crossover cables to connect your computers to the switch). However, don't expect the switch to outlast your computer. A friend and I both had one of these die on us after about a year and a half of use. Considering that I've purchased switches from manufacturers far less well-known than SMC that were cheaper and are at least still working, I have to wonder about the quality of SMC's engineering and manufacturing. SMC may make some decent products, but if you're looking for a switch that will last you a while I'd stay away from this particular model."
3,Whiney whimpering annoying,"I went to buy this Rescue Pet for my child, but didn't even get out of the store with it. It whimpered the entire time in my cart and on the way out to the car. The sound was so annoying, I took it right back into the store to return it. If noise bothers you, don't buy this toy."
5,Healing Drum Kit,"The Healing Drum Kit is an excellent purchase for those who want to know about drumming. The materials included, besides a small drum, allow the purchaser to understand the natural relationship between drumming and human nature. Both the written and disk materials are easy to understand and to apply to actual practice."
2,not what I expected,"This set is so simplistic that it seems more appropriate for a 5 year old child and I failed to see any ""spiritual"" connection at all. I did not learn anything from it although the moderator has a pleasant voice and the little drum is cute. I would recommend this for small children to keep them busy for a half hour without supervision or in a child's classroom for something to do when they can't go out onto the playground. I've played it twice and I'm done with it. For me, at least, it was a waste of money. But I most certainly would buy it for a child."
3,"Three and a half stars, really","Lady Bell is a charming regency romance. Williams uses humour, mistaken identities, and a rather sweet take on the regency. The heroine, Arabella, goes to London with her brother and his best friend in order to embark upon a season and hopefully get over a recent dissapointment in love. Along the way the trio stops so that the young men can view a cockfight at an inn. While wandering unescorted through the village, Arabella meets the Earl of Magdalen, a man just as dashing as the fellow she had last been interested in. The Earl mistakes her for a cyprian and makes his interest clear. The rest of the book has some fun moments as she keeps her true identity from him but continues flirting. Very sweet, a few moments of suspense wondering when he'll figure out who she is, and a fair amount of friendly fun between all the main characters. All in all, the story is enjoyable but without any high tension or danger."
4,As described,This bookshelf came as described. The only thing I have to complain about is the time/effort it took to assemble it. It is very sturdy!
2,legendary lee wylie cd,"the long shipping time was disappointing, but the fact that, after careful cleaning of the disc, the same (about 5) glkitches and skips persistis more disappointing. the music, as was expected, is wonderful.amazon's sale presentations for the product are fair and accurate.gk"
3,Good tunes but lacking originality,"Honestly, The Crescent haven't made a bad CD. Songs like ""On the Run"", ""Test of Time"" and ""Streets of Tide"" are bouncy jangly tracks. In fact, this CD is a decent listen from start to finish.My problem is, it isn't anything new. After a few runs, things blend together in a massive La's, Oasis, Real People cocktail that tastes pleasant enough but leaves you well, just wanting more.Still, it's not a bad CD to plop into your rotation. It just needs a moderate dose of shelftime in between playings to sound fresh again."
2,Description totally inaccurate,"This case is inaccurately described. There are no interior compartments, side or rear pockets. This is nothing more than a single compartment case with a small interior mesh pocket just large enough for a memory card."
4,Don Cherry deserves an Oscar nomination for his great yearly perfomances...,"here, in his videos and on Coaches Corner.I like wathcing him even more than JohnMadden on Football (well...John only doesNFL Football, and that's part of the problem,because I'd rather watch the Ar.FL or CFL)!Keep up the good work, Grapes, Tim and Blue!"
4,Good strategy forecasting planning guidline!,"The book divided into three parts.Part one is a review of the issues around forcasting strategy and planning and the role of HR in these.Part two deal with the component parts of the strategic human resource forcast.Part there is concerned with the human resource plan,which is outlined.In essence the book will answer the questions:How can I help my organization to be more successful through the best use of HR?How can I get HR on to the strategic aganda?How do I deal with the end to end process of HR forecasting and planning?How do I persuade my organization to take these models on board and include them in it's own strategy setting prlcess?How do I implement the processes?How do I manage them on an ongoing basis?Was this review helpful to you?"
1,Bad batteries or charger.,"The batteries would not charge. In the event of a power failure, all station presets are lost and it cannot be used as a portable radio."
3,"Trail blazin', ya'll.","Hot damn! Karate keeps evolving their style completly oblivious to current music trends or any demands of their fans. The press for this album said it was going to blend and alternate bertween styles ""like a good mixtape"" (which inaccurate, thank god). More of the groovy jazz banter and vivid lyrics found on Unsolved, but with a bit of a punch at times. I put this on for one of my friends and he described it as ""sexy."" If your Advanced Jazz Theory teacher dug Fugazi he's be in a band like this. Reccomened for 20-somethings who read E. Annie Proulx, music majors, and Geoff Farina's wife."
3,Good computer - Poor support,This computer is a good performer. Unfortunately it suffers from Toshiba's poor support. The technicians know less than I do and are unable to troubleshoot anything besides the most BASIC of problems.
3,"Good laptop, bad keyboard","The Toshiba Satellite P105-S0722 is a good value. I was looking for a desktop replacement for my primary personal computer. After reviewing offerings from Dell, Ibm, HP and IBM determined that for the money the Toshiba was the best if my budget was less than $2000.Good features: (1) speed, (2) everything works, (3) good screen; (4) very good video card, I run the native screen plus a 24"" dell monitor with no problem.Poor features: Keyboard layout is strange. For a touch typist the smaller than usual right shift key is a problem. I would have perferred if the 10-key was removed and a larger keyboard was available.Bottomline: This is my first Toshiba, it was good but did not awe me. When it comes time to order a new computer, I will probably look at either a Dell or Alienware and pay extra."
3,baby not named,"This baby book has a lot of names to look through but I was looking for somethiing bigger. Even with all the names it is still missing a huge amount and some of the names it has is completely unusable by anyone as far as I can imagine. Coupled with the fact it took 2 weeks to get to us from 2 states away, I wish I had picked up a different one."
3,Not enough common names,My daughter was discouraged in trying to select a common name. This book seems to focus on more of the unusual and foreign names.
2,Lacking....,"I was surprised how much this book was lacking. It didn't even contain names that I considered to relatively common. Also, it only lists a name under its most popular spelling (under that lising it will give alternative spellings but still...) I ended up buying a different baby name book. This one just didn't cut it."
3,Quick reference no real insight,After breezing through this book I realised that you get what you pay for. The book leaves you wanting for more. It provides different spellings and short one word descriptions for names. Enunciation and a real look into the names you are trying to find just isn't there.
5,15000+ baby names,Easy to use and informative. Has a wide range of names with various spellings and meanings. Definitely recommended and useful.
2,Just okay.,"Does not have a lot of names. I was disappointed with the limited selection and would prefer a pronunciation guide. Nothing new, interesting or exciting here. Information is limited and shortsighted."
3,Common names,"The book is ok, a lot of common names to choose from, nothing ridiculous. I did highlighted a few names but I was looking for something more unique"
2,Same information available on baby web sites,"May be an okay starting point for your first child as an easy skim through but definitely not comprehensive enough. It was just a long list of names with their origins and meaning. The top most popular girl/boy names were useful (as our avoid list, but outdated by now) and is something you can quickly find online. Would be better to start at a baby naming web site and go through the list. Haven't found the best baby naming book, butThe Baby Name Wizard: A Magical Method for Finding the Perfect Name for Your Babyby Laura Wattenberg doesn't seem half bad - The Baby Name Wizard doesn't include origins but does include similar styled names, sibling name suggestions, popularity, etc."
4,Norton User Switches,"I have used Norton for ten years upgrading occasionally. Each version that I got was more screwed up then the last one I had. Each version would not allow use of certain modules, but I was able to trick the software into letting me run the modules that I needed. Finally the 06 version was Dead on Arrival (DOA) I finally called it quits for Norton. V Com did some things that Norton could but would not and some things that Norton did not know how to do yet. V Com is cleaning up the mess that Norton made of my computer. This is the best software that I have come across in a long time."
2,Fix-it Pro 6,"I have had this software for about a week. At first, it seemed to be working like it was advertised. I keep my computer maintained anyway so I didn't see huge performance help. However, when I ran the registry cleaner, it did something to my computer for which I had to go back to a prior windows restore point. I was so frustrated with trying to solve the problem that I have not reinstalled the software. Personally, I think there has to be better software out there. I don't have a lot of experience with other utilities but I have tried TuneUp Utilities 2006. It seems to be better suited for PC Maintenance and especially the touchy registry cleaner issues. TuneUp did not mess up my registry and has a better user interface. My overall opinion of this software is to look elsewhere."
4,Better than Symantec,"This software is solid, much better than the newer Symantec's Norton SystemWorks, which seems to slow down a PC until you got one of the fastest CPUs. The software comes with a $20 rebate on the box."
2,Network connectivity issues after install,"I bought this software two days ago, Installed it on my laptop and all of a sudden, my network connection was messed up. I could not figure how to connect to the wireless or wired network. My other computers were still able to connect, so it was a problem with the computer with Fix It installed. After much work, I finally uninstalled the software and right away was able to get back on the network. I am not sure if there is some kind of firewall setting with the software, or if it was just the software itself.Anyway, I am unsure whether to reinstall this software or not."
1,Sheer Poison,"I ran Fix-It utilities on a fairly clean, fast PC and, as soon as it went through it's general scan and fix-it routine, the machine slowed to a crawl and the internet connection (DSL) no longer worked. Using Windows System Restore, I was able to bring the machine back to where it had been.I thought, perhaps it was the machine, so I tested it on another fast PC at another location and exactly the same thing happened...no internet connection and a number of applications not functioning. Again, System Restore saved the day.Evidently This utility is a bit overzealous in cleaning the registry files and it left us with a number of non-working applications. I am returning it immediately (the first return to Amazon). Obviously, I am not a company flack writing a glowing review."
1,Don't buy it even if its free after rebate,"Don't buy this software even if you get it free after rebates. It corrupts your windows registry and makes things worse for you. You will feel your computer is far better after uninstalling this software.Instead, just follow these steps to keep your PC fast:1. Run Disk Cleanup (provided by XP)2. Defrag your hard-disk regularly3. Clean the registry (there are lot of free software available to clean your registry).That's all that you need to keep your computer fit. No need to use softwares such as Fix-IT"
4,Super,"I purchased this on the advice of the technician who ""fixed"" the woes of my computer. It is thus far working well!"
1,WARNING!!!!,"I installed the product hoping it would help me with all the errors I was getting (I have Windows XP). Well, 2 weeks and $200 it's what it took for me to have my computer repaired. It would not let me log on to windows, I got errors I've never seen and it completely messed all my files. BIG waste of money. I had to re-format my hard drive and my computer is only 1 month old!!!"
3,VCOM Fix-it,"I bought this to be able to easily clean up the registry. I was disappointed that I wasn't able to clean unnecessary registry info easier. Maybe I haven't found all the ways to do this, and in that case, it's also not good because I've really tried and it's not obvious like I'd hoped."
1,Creates More Problems Than It Repairs,"Purchased Fix-It Utilities 6 a few weeks back and installed it on my desk top running Windows XP. Immediately after installation I ran the program and repaired only the minimum errors as recommended. However, many programs on my computer would not run and could not access many files. Called VCOM for help ,but their solution did not work. I was even unable to get system restore to correct the problem. I had to re-format my hard drive and re-install all my programs and files. I cannot recommend this registry repair."
5,C+ Programming,Receive item ask described and posted on the internet. I'm please to get what I was looking for.
4,Great for minor arthritic pains,"While taking this product, there is no doubt that the morning joint stiffness has been greatly reduced. It may not be advertised for this, but it sure does help."
3,Good product,"I just started using the second bottle of this Supplement and even though it's hard to say if it is actually working or not after such a short period of time, I believe that it is a very good supplemental addition."
5,Fun--But Be Careful of Wind,"This is a very interesting Air Hog. The only problem is that on very windy days it will go very, very far if you give it the full 50 pumps stated in the instructions. On its VERY first flight (a very windy day) it sailed up and away and landed in the woods at least three to four hundred yards away. Luckily, it only took us a half hour to find it. We (my dad and I) suggest that on windy days you fly Twin Fury on as few as 20 and no more than 30 pumps. It does excellent stunts even when pumped as little as this. Ours has done really good banks and sidewinder stunts and has almost done complete loops and still maintained flight without crashing to the ground."
4,We'll find it after harvest,"This plane is amazing. We were getting well over the 300 ft. advertised distance per flight. Flight control is a crap shoot. You have no idea where it's going to land. The control surfaces were laughable. You should have planty of room to fly, preferably standing in the middle of a 400 ft. radius treeless circle. On the first day of flight, the aircraft made it to the bean field. 10 volunteers and 2 hours later, the search was called off (and we ""saw"" where it came down). Black is not the ideal color for this toy. Perhaps dayglo orange or some color that beeps would be a better idea. I'll look for wreckage after the combine does its thing this week."
1,total junk,"i bought this router to replace a craftsman ""all in one"" rotary tool that i paid $[...] buck for and lasted me 7 years. this router vibrates so much you cant even control it. it was so bad i sent it back after using it twice. it is not worth $[...] dollars never mind $[...], for that price i can get a nice trim router. i am a contractor and know good tools this is not one."
1,base is junk,"The plastic edge trimmer base is cheap junk.I ordered this router for all it's acessories, doesn't plunge cut,no stops,angled routing would probably be risky to your material, accurate setup a challenge,no detents for specific angles or markings for that matter.The base for circle cutting is wobbly and vibration would most likely make it come loose.I ordered one the first one came with a broken trimmer base as did it's replacement and the third broke while using it for the first time ruining my project. Better off going to HF paying $25 for basically the same junk if you feel the need to throw money away."
4,"Good listen, but not Marco Antonio Solis","I bought this for my wife, who loves Solis. This is a really good album, but quite a bit different from Solis' solo works. Recommend for true Solis fans, a good album you should not do without. For non Solis fans, this album stands by itself as a completely different style of music."
4,Good but with one Minor Flaw.,"This GE Slimline VHS Rewinder is good. It is nice to use this to rewind video tapes back to the beginning instead of having to use the VCR and wear out the heads! My only complaint is that some of our old blank media video tapes that are little longer, bigger and bulkier than most other VHS video tapes do not fit in the rewinder. Actually they fit but the rewinder door but very snugly and the door will not close, it just pops open and if you can't get the door to close you can't rewind the tapes. But all in all a good product."
5,good night gorilla,the dvd was new and reviews by the 5 year old twin grandsons is A+100. sound and illustrations excellent from my viewpoint. wonderful childrens' stories enjoyed by all who view.
3,Liked goodnight gorilla but not some of the other books,I bought this for goodnight gorilla which i was happy with but it comes with other books some of which I don't think I'd want the print version of and are radically different in plotline sophistication over goodnight gorilla. these should be bundled with age appropriateness.
4,Not Bad for Beginners,"Swingin' to the Big Bands is actually a pretty good aerobics video for extreme beginners who don't mind a little bit of danciness. It's fun to do, and the class shows some good examples of what ""real people"" look like when they get fit."
1,Austin ain't got that swing,"This has to be the all-time worst workout video I've ever viewed. The swing music sets a sleepy pace for the workout. Denise Austin neither describes the moves nor does any cuing whatsoever-- her comments mainly consisted of ""Try to do as much as you can"" and ""Woo!"".The choreography was embarrassing-- Austin was frequently off tempo, and you could tell that the backup dancers were trying not to laugh. The worst part was the samba segment. Austin kept getting distracted by the wandering saxophone player and mugged for the camera nonstop, with the effect that the rest of the dancers wandered around behind her in a samba-like fashion. The stretching was inadequate, and I barely broke a sweat.I can't imagine that anyone would get anything out of this video-- the elderly (who I imagine this is targeted to) won't be able to follow the routines, and anyone with a modicum of fitness would be too bored and annoyed to care."
3,Small!,"I ordered this for my son's 4th birthday to burry at the beach and it is literally the size of my fist, The chocolate was good quality but the chest is very thin plastic and mine arrived already popping open at the seam. I wish I would have just purchased chocolate coins elsewhere. I ended up getting a chest three times that size made of wood with real hinges and everything at hobby lobby for $5. And this ended upp being 20$ wasted due to the ten dollar shipping fee. If it is just the chocolate your after it tastes nice with a slightly nutty flavor to it, but overall this was just not what I was looking for."
3,cute but tiny,These are cute but they are so tiny for the price i doubt i would buy again. but I needed them for baby shower
3,Not QUITE what i expected,"I work for the YMCA here in Cupertino and we had a BLAST on Valentine's day giving away a ""Big Kiss"" at a rafle, so we thought we would give away tresure for St Patty's day. I looked on Amazone and found this. I haven't tried the chocolates and don't plan on it. This review is for the pacage only.When it came and i pulled it out of all the styrofome peanuts all i saw was the coins in a flimsy plastic box. I thought it was a hard plastic chest with a i top that swing open on hinges. NOPE!!! the chocolates MAY be good, i don't know, but the chest leaves a lot to be desired, especially when you are looking for quality"
5,Excellant service,"I was concerned that I might not be able to get these chocolates in time for Christmas, but they did a great job of shipping them out quickly."
2,shop for something better,"..and save a load of money. We've had this system for some months now and are learning to truly dislike it. The sound is not natural, the controls are confusing and for the price, it has to be the worst value in home entertainment on the market. Of the two stars I give it, one is for the ruggedness of the remote and the other is for my admiration of the company's slick marketing that got us to shell out the big bucks for this featureless turkey. My advice? Get something else."
5,Great System,"I heard this system in a store and it sounded great so i brought it home and hooked it up... it still sounded great. U can make a really exaggerated bass or bass that just picks up when it needs to. I went through probably 5 different setups with the speakers and to be honest it totally changed the sound quality. So anyone who gave up on their system and said it sounded bad, should have tried rearranging their speakers a little. all in all, great system"
2,Junk System,"I bought one from circuit city and hooked up in my home. In Store, it sounded great, but in home it is not really. What I realized is because of the selective clips, it sounded great in stores.In the Bose Outlet Stores, they will show a demo in a soundproof room with proper speaker adjustment. It requires a kind of closed rectangle shape room. In real life, not all the apartments will be having this kind of living room. That is why you wont find any bose stores in town.Many of the remote control functions are missing in the system including Closed Caption, Slow, XX Frame forwarding, eject and etc. All these are there in $35 DVD Player.Overall I dont recommend this system. I had Panasonic scht900, paid about $500. Definately there is diffrence between the panasonic one and bose one, but I dont feel its worth for that money. Dont go for it."
1,Overprice Junk,"Bought it hoping it would sound nice in one small unit big mistake. speaker lack on low's (bass). Speaker's are poorly design come people no metal encasing not even going to talk about how the cone of the speaker was made. The amp in this unit sound like it is only pushing 15 watt's. Bose overratetechical specifications. This thing only cost them about $300.00 to produced. come people you could have put at less $1200 into making this thing. to make this simple return the Bose, and when with a Pioneer vsx-d912 Receiver, Pioneer Elite M-10 2 ch Amp and polk 3-way floorstanding speakers (RTI12BK) also there home theater speakers, With pioneer dvd burner. sound way better then the bose lifestyle 28. take my word test the bose and other system there before buying the lifestyle you won't like it. people who have this system a good rating must be hard of hearing or it they first system. STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS OVERPRICED JUNK. NEVER BUYING BOSE AGAIN."
2,"Great Sound, Crazy Price!","Bose makes great audio products. The Lifestyle 28 produces an incredible sound with high volume and no distortion at all. These speakers are only different from the old ones in that they are smaller and have bigger decibals for volume. But the price is simply ridiculous. For half the price you could get a Klipsch Synergy system, true power with perfect fidelity. The price you are paying for the Bose speakers are just for the fact that they are small and easily conceilable, not because they have the best sound (because they don't) or because they look great (because they don't)."
2,I am not impressed,"For [the money] you can be totally blown away by a speaker system. Try getting a Harmon/Kardon 7.1 45 WPC Reciever with Infinity floorstanding with sub, infinity center, and any high quality surround speakers and you will be absolutely impressed and you will ask yourself why you ever thought Bose was right for you. Bose - Better sound through advertising?"
2,Bose LifeStyle 28,"The system came well documented with everything needed for a complete set-up. This made assembly and dis-assembly very easy. We watched 10 DVD's. It ""hung"" on two DVD's. The power of the system was very disappointing. We had the volume control near maximum to hear well. The bass was very weak. The highs and surround sound feeling were pretty good. We did have a problem with customer service that was a show stopper. We returned the system believing we could find something comparable at a lower price with better customer service."
5,God's outline for the Christian Life.,"Arthur W. Pink's unique ability to bring God's Word to practical application for the Christian believer is best described in one word, ""conviction."" Practical Christianity starts with the process of salvation and walks you through how to live a God pleasing life. Pink's Calvinistic theology will drive you to your knees in prayer and repentance and then show you the blessings God has for you in this life and the next. This is a must read for every Christian."
2,The Pink Wall of Text,"If Arthur Pink were around today, he'd be one of those people who goes to online forums and posts what is known as the Wall of Text. While there's very little wrong with his work doctrinally (there are times, though not in this book, where he shows his Theosophical background), Pink is mainly effective in saying in 50,000 words what could have been more aptly said in just 50. After a while his talent for saying the same thing 100 different ways over the course of six pages becomes tiresome and the intelligent reader starts looking for relief. It's OK stuff, but how anyone can say it is ""meat"" or ""gold"" is beyond me. It's done much better and with much more intelligence by other authors with far better credentials.Bottom line is, don't confuse being able to leave (some) readers hyperventilating with an indication of quality."
5,Women's history and food... two favorite topics in one book,"I love this book! It explores and celebrates the rich cultural diversity of the south, through the eyes of a young girl and ten aging women who share their memories...and their recipes. (There are twelve different versions of cornbread...yum!) As the author writes, ""...the South was never only black and white, but was always a rich rainbow of ethnic groups..."" So you'll find represented here African-American, North European, Italian, Mexican, Cajun, Appalachian, Cherokee and Jewish traditions."
5,Best Visual Guide to Feng Shui,"This is a beautiful coffee-table book on Feng Shui, with literally hundreds of excellent color photographs, drawings, diagrams and other illustrations to help make visual sense of the concepts. One of its greatest assets is that it generally supports the excellent writings of Sarah Rossbach and Master Lin Yun on the subject, while some other illustrated volumes I've seen completely contradict them. Gill Hale knows his subject and writes with common sense and authority. The book is arranged logically, with chapters on clarifying your personal preferences (or type), placement of the home on the property, treatment of each major room, a major section on Feng Shui in the garden, the uses of water, color, sound and other enhancements and cures, and a concluding section on Feng Shui in the workplace. It features a wealth of design ideas that can be incorporated into real-life settings without costing a fortune."
2,A dictionary of Feng Shui in Chaos,"The writer seems to have collected a large set of Feng Shui facts. Lots of cool pictures. The order of information and lack of continuity between subjects makes me think that the author does not know feng shui as much as she thinks she might. For example, try switching positions of the last two columns of the table of relationships of the five elements."
5,Excellent potty motivator!,"As a mother of three (the youngest being boy/girl twins)I've had my share of ""toilet training"". After reading this book, (MY Potty Activity Book by Tracy Foote)I was impressed by all the information and activities packed within the 63 pages. Each activity is useful in familiarizing toddlers with the ""potty learning"" basics. The perforated pages allow for easy removal after completing the activities. Included is a wonderful reference section utilizing 45 ideas to help you transition your child from diapers to ""big pants"". Your child will love having his/her own potty progress chart (included) as well as feeling a huge sense of pride when they receive their potty graduate certificate after completing the activities. Wonderful book that entertains while it educates!"
2,Not overly impressed,This book is a bunch of hand drawn pictures. My son was bored with it after the 1st sitting. It's too large for him to hold on his lap while he is on the toilet. Fine while he's @ his play table but that's not why I bought it.I consider this purchase to be money down the drain.
2,So-So,"Month or so after buying it, one of the legs ""slips"" like loose ball lock or something. I can use it at half height with no problems.Not for heavy cameras."
2,"typical,nothing new","says it will create a cover for the canker. it does, but only if u dont eat,talk,or move your tounge around your mouth. so in reality, it doesnt do anything but numb the pain for about 2 minutes. worthless"
5,AQUI VIENE LA RESE`A DE UN LECTOR DE WASHINGTON,"QUE ME PONE LOS PELOS DE PUNTA...¡PORQUE DICE LA PURA VERDAD !Es un hombre que tiene una amante...y nos dice por qué:Porque el ama a quien lo considera el hombnre más importante del mundo, el mejor amante, Y QUE LE DEDICA TODO EL TIEMPO Y LA ATENCIÓN...QUE NOSOTRAS, LAS ESPOSAS, OLVIDAMOS DEDICAR A NUESTRO MARIDO !Hay que escarmentar en cabeza ajena leyendo este libro que nosENSEÑA LA OTRA CARA DE LA MONEDA : QUE NOSOTRAS MISMAS SOMOS LAS QUE EMPUJAMOS AL ESPOSO A LOS BRAZOS DE OTRA con nuestra indiferencia, con no dedicarle tiempo o interés, MUCHAS VECES PORQUE NOS HEMOS CONVERTIDO EN MADRES DE TIEMPO COMPLETO...Y EL MARIDO YA SÓLO NOS SIRVE COMO PROVEEDOR !¡Aguas, muchachas !NO DEJEN DE LEER ESTE LIBRO: PARA VENCER AL ENEMIGO ( A LA OTRA )PRIMERO HAY QUE CONOCERLO...¡DEFENDAMOS LO QUE ES NUESTRO !"
4,Nice Power Console,"Does its job, I guess. I'll find out for sure if the other electronics in my house ever get surged. It is very nice looking and goes well with my other AV equipment in my home theater. One small complaint is that the lcd display is pretty cheap and some of the numbers are not very visible at all. It reminds me of what a calculator looks like when you apply pressure to its screen and the numbers become illegible. This sorta pissed me off, so I exchange it through Amazon thinking that I may have just gotten a bad unit. When I got the brand new one it had the same issue so I concluded that they must all be this way. All in all, its not a huge deal to me because the rest of the unit looks good and seems solidly built. You can't really read the display anyway if you are more than a couple of feet from the unit."
5,Good Holiday CD,I am far from a music critic but I know what I like for Christmas music and this CD is outstanding. The Singing Hoosiers are excellent in their performance.
5,Yowza!,"Very lively and stirring arrangements, using appropriate forces. You will never hear the like of Little Drummer Boy arranged as Ravel's Bolero--some benighted people dislike either or both--which is truly creative. Played this disk twice through on super-audiophile system once while writing my cards and once in listening chair and could not hear anything but joy. Much improved over his other Xmas effort and the John Williams Joy to the World misfire.."
3,Good Christmas Music,This item was a download and after some assistance from the IT Dept we were able to get access. Thanks to the IT Dept.
1,A Poorly Mixed Bag,"As with their earlier Christmas Pops album, Telarc has diluted the beautiful instrumental and choral numbers by including soloists and the King's Singers all of uninteresting and inferior vocal abilities. And to compound the crime, with this album they have expanded the number of these inadequate tracks which significantly affects the overall enjoyment of the album. You can skip this if your taste is for classical music or classically trained vocalists."
1,Worst product ever,"I hardly write review but i have decided to write this to help and caution others about this product. I had most of my hair when i started procerin just some thinnning and decided to take procerin to make my hair thicker. Within 2 weeks of using the product my hair got significantly thick and i was so happy. However, after a month and half of taking this pills I had the worst shedding ever that my scalp became visible to others. i continue taking the pills as i thought it was the shedding period. however after a year of taking this pills, the loss never returned. It has been 10 months since i quit procerin and the loss still havent returned. the only thing procerin did was to speed up the growth of my existing hair while i was losing more hair. I hate procerin ... Pls if u love ur hair stay away from this pill as u will most likely lose more hair...."
3,Started to work but,Started to work but after a while was not as effective so switched to sthg else (Nioxin). Retrying it again now to see if it can still be effective as now Nioxin is not working all that great! Trying it with the foam (Procerin) this time.
1,"Be aware of what they are offering, don't trust them!","I purchase the 3 month supply kit, but I've just received 1 packet that last for just one month!! I paid $55 instead of $20 to get the three packets, but it seems that it doesn't worth it."
2,"The company is scamming you, but it still works",Its apparent that anyone reading these comments will clearly understand that this company is ripping everyone off by mislabeling one bottle for a 3 month supply. I ordered this also and received 2 bottles instead of 3 so it should be extra clear to anyone interested in ordering this should Only buy the 6 month or 1 month supply.The reason I did not give it one star was because when I contacted Amazon they credited me with $21 within one day.Also after finishing the 2 month supply I noticed considerably less hair fall...a lot less. Which to me seems to be the biggest problem.
3,It's a 1 month supply!,"Guys,Look at the pictures of the 1 month, 3 month and 6 month supplies.Having ordered all of them, I can tell you that you get the same quantity for the 1 and 3 month supply,while you get 6 bottles for the six month supply.Someone made a mistake!The bottle says 90 tablets (which might have confused someone), but you're supposed to take 3 per day...So don't buy this item.I tried contacting Amazon about it, twice, but they weren't very helpful.Try the 1 month or 6 month instead.As for the results...I don't know. I'm not completely bald, but my forehead goes all the way to the center of my skull :)I've been using it for two months now, and I can't say I've noticed any change...I actually think I've been losing hair faster these last couple of months (or maybe it's just because I expected some magic to happen when taking the pills).I'll post again in another couple of months.I actually took 'before' pictures so I can compare."
2,Drop the violin,"Interesting bass and drum playing, but the screeching violin gave me a headache. And this is by no means ""the great jazz album of 2003"". I want my money back."
4,Read-n-grow: Preschool teacher's opinion,"We have been using the Read-n-Grow picture Bible for our Bible story time every day for a long time in our Pre-K classes. In fact, we had completely worn it out. I purchased this one as a replacement.After we (the teachers)""read"" the story, the children stand up and we go around showing the pictures. It helps the children get a more accurate picture of how it might have looked at that time.If there is a discrepancy between the picture and the actual biblical account, we explain that there were no cameras then, so this is the artist's idea of how it looked. The children are free to come and look at it during Center Time.The pictures are in a comic strip format, so it is easier for them to follow the sequence of the story when looking at it on their own."
4,Great Book for a Soup Lover!,"Lots of back stories and sidebar information. It's a wonderful reference on soups, and I will keep the book in my library, but it's not every going to be a go to kind of book"
3,Poor customer service,"I purchased 2 sets of these speakers previously (1 year ago ) and had a problem with one speaker on which the grille started to rust.I contacted the manufacturer directly, explained the problem and the customer rep told me that there was going to be a charge of $10.00 for this item, plus shipping and that they would get back to me when they had located the item. Well, no one got back to me.I feel that this should have been a warranty item and in view of the charges I opted to repaint the rusted one myself.Other than that the product works well and the price is low enough not to get too exited about it, so I purchased another set for spares."
3,Get what you pay for.,I was looking for an inexpensive set of outdoor speakers with decent sound. A little disappointed in the quality of sound but of course the price was right. If I were buying all over again I would identify a speakers which I could listen to first and I would probably spend a little more money.
4,Not his best,This is a very good concert but not his best. I enjoyed it and would have given it a 5 star but I have another that I like better.
5,Very Great DVD,"I watched this DVD three times and I've only purchased it a week ago. Engelbert's voice was so good in this concert. The song selection was amazing. The 30 minute tour of his home was personable, entertaining and shows how modest and kind Engelbert really is to his fans. Highly recommended, make sure this is one of your DVDs."
4,Make me laugh,"In this crazy world we live in, sometimes we have to test our emotions to see if they're still there. Whenever I feel the need to see if I still have the ability to just laugh and giggle, I watch this movie. It's not the juvenile type of humor and some of the subject matter isn't funny at all; however, if it catches you at the right time, it sure can crack you up! I don't particularly care for Jim Carrey, but he's got his moments in this film! The truth can hurt...but it can also humor you!"
3,This Is One Of Carrey's Best!,"I think that this is one of the best Jim Carrey movies ever. It's got all the laughs you could ask for. The funniest part of this film, is when Carrey tries to lie to himself.Kids, teens, and adults would really enjoy this film. I suggest you get it as soon as possible. But only if you haven't seen it yet. Jim Carrey has a 24 hour curse. Meaning, he can't lie."
3,Jim or Cary? I can't decide,"Funny movie. But put in the mother's position: I would have no idea which one to pick. I guess I would have to get with Jenny's ex-husband instead. Forget custody of the kids, I'd take custody of him. But, back to the topic at hand. Both studs play a tug of war through the whole movie."
3,Jim Carry at One of His Best,Jim Carry is funny in a lot of movies but this one is not the best one that he was in. I would still by it and I guess that you will watch it more then one time!
4,Fast becoming one of my faves,"Very funny with a good message. I appreciate the fact that it is funny, but still presented in a responsible manner. That is, it isn't too racy that you would be embarrassed to watch in mixed company. The movie praises virtue, it does not ridicule it."
4,A solid Jim Carey comedy,I highly enjoyed this movie. My favorite of Jim Carey's comedic performances. The scene with the pen alone is well worth picking up this movie for. The only Jim Carey movies I like more are his more serious ones like The Truman Show or Man on the Moon.
3,Not funny,"I probably would have given this movie two stars, but I guess that it isn't way below average. I just don't like it because it isn't funny. Jim Carrey movies are supposed to be funny, but this one doesn't even make me laugh once. Some people I know like it, so maybe you will think differently of it, but that is my opinoin."
3,Aren't all Lawyers Liars?,"Aren't all lawyers and pollitians liars?Of course they are!It wouldn't be America without them.In this film however,Jim Carey's son makes a wish on his birthday that his dad cannot lie for one whole day...now the fun begins.This is a great family comedy,with a little moral/ethical message worked in there as well.Courtroom catastrophies turn into huge laughs while Jim Carey's character struggles and is forced to be honest for once in his life for one whole day.Jim Carey is as damm funny as a stand up comdeian as he is with physical comedy,and in this film you see it all.This is a great film for the family and certainly deserving of multiple viewings.Highly reccomended by me,kid tested,Jonny Rotten approoved.And the moral message?Well,maybe if we all lied a bit less and were a little more honest with one another,everything would be a bit easier to deal with,and life made more pleasent?"
3,Liar Liar Collector Edition DVD,"This review is in reference to the collector's edition DVD.I love the movie and I thought I would spend a little extra getting the special edition DVD vs. the regular DVD, but I don't really feel it was worth it. The ""outtakes"" are only 30 seconds in total. ""Bridging the comedy chasm"" was about 15 minutes long and wasn't terribly exciting or insightful. My recommendation is to skip the collector's version"
5,friggin hilarious!!l,i love this movie! i feel this is one of Jim Carreys better moview wehre you are learning a lesson and laughing your ass off at the same time! definitely appreciate this movie and what its teaching its viewers about liars ;)
3,Liar liar dvds,My DVDs do not work can u please contact me says on the screen wrong region. Contact via email please
4,Recomended only for Jim Carey fans,I have seen better from Jim he tried to hard to have a family one here and be funny at the same time wich he is but he is not regular Jim Carrey and I don't know why in this case some of his other movies are the Jim Carrey movies of choice.Action 7 Story 10 Direction 8 Action 6 Entertaining 8Overall=39/50 Still 4 stars however wich is nice
3,"Forcing Lawyers to be truthful, what a concept!","A story about a lawyer that can't lie! Of course all states have rules that a lawyer must be disbarred for allowing a false statement to enter the courtroom. This movie takes the notion that most people share, that lawyers are paid liars, and creates a humor comic devise. A lawyer that must tell the truth!The movie is even family friendly.I Didn't see this when it first came out. It was much better than I expected. Not as good as pet detective, but it is an interesting premise, and Carrey did a great job carrying it off."
4,Excellent Comedy,"This is one of Jim Carreys best. He's a successful lawyer who's divorced and his ex keeps urging him to stop disappointing his son. That is until his son makes a birthday wish for his Dad not to lie. An attorney who can't lie?! Very, very funny!"
2,Way too extreme for a comedy,"I am a HUGE Jim Carrey fan, so naturally I was expecting a great movie. When I popped this movie into the VCR and actually saw it, it was alright for a few minutes. Who can't like the 'I've Had better' part? Unfortunately, the movie doesn't know what it wants to be...a comedy or a family film? So the rest of the film is just a long running gag with Jim's off-the-wall shenanigans. Jim Carrey is way too cartoonish to be considered heartwarming. The film might have worked if Jim's character showed a little emotion, but he's too much of a jerk to really root for. If you are looking for a funny, charming comedy that you can let your kids watch, get Mrs. Doubtfire...and if you're a Carrey fan, stick with Ace Ventura."
3,Liar Liar...ummm So So,"I saw Liar Liar and I though it was ok. This was deffenitaly not one of Jim Carry's best! Yes, it did have it's funny moments but a lot of it just talked about sex. And if I want to see a movie I mostly want it to be funny! And Jim Carry is funny in all his movies including this one but this was not his best! So I would say,""yeah go see it"", and if you like it buy it but don't buy it if you haven't seen it yet! thanks for reading!"
3,Is this comedy?,"I am a little disappointed about this movie. I expected this was comedy before I saw.But this movie isn't so funny for me except a plane scene. I think if you don't expect too much about this movie, you'll enjoy."
2,Premise of movie is a lie.,The idea of a pathological liar having to tell the truth for 24 hours is okay. However the saccharine ending in which the divorced parents get reunited per the child's fantasy wishes is ludicrous and unfunny. I increased my rating from one to two simply because the movie portrayed lawyers in the correct light.
1,Uses religious profanity,"Liar Liar had some good acting by Jim Carrey but - to me, as bizarre as it will no doubt seem to some - the use of religious profanity (specifically, taking the holy Name of The Lord God Almighty in vain) ruined it for me."
2,very average,i've found Jim Carrey to be very overrated.all his films are really dumb&lame.just like the Wayans brothers films.this film had a good idea but formula sets in and what little interest that was there is gone.
2,USUAL CARREY FILM SOME LAUGHS BUT OBVIOUS,"Typical and offers few laughs but this obvious film by Jim Carrey is by- the- numbers comedy he did better films like THE MASK,DUMB AND DUMBER,ACE VENTURA:WHEN NATURE CALLS,THE TRUMAN SHOW,AND THE MAJESTIC.this one features lawyer Fletcher Reede always making lies and ignoring his son's life also jealous of his ex-wife Audrey and her sensitive boyfriend Jerry.but the film loses steam on Carrey's frenetic mugging,slapstick,and crude humor of sexual and blue pen jokes."
1,?,"Um..you call this a film Carrey? ... I ""WAS"" a fan ofCarrey, Cable guy :Great film. All the pet detective ones were good aswell.But this was really shoddy.It was not funny in the least, Carrey acted like a complete plonker and over did every moment to make the film worse...and that cheesy grin that just announces that its about as funny as root cannal hahah. Well he nearly lost my audiance all together untill he redeamed himself with the trueman show and man on the moon.Hey what was wrong with cable guy....it was his best. Someone does something great like cable guy and truman show and it gets smacked in the face with a wet kipper.But when they do something ... like this sad excuse for a film, it is applauded. ODD, VERY ODD."
5,WATCH THIS MOVIE,"tHIS IS THE BEST Jim Carry film in the WORLD if u want to laugh watch this film here are some tips tips: do not eat drink smoke or do somthing that u have yo consentrate because beileve me you will never before also keep youngsters 4th grade & down away at times because all though this flick is funny there is sex related humor and crude launguage in it, and remember to return it on time even though yoyu want to keep watching it , that is if you rent it of corse. This is a MUST SEE film....It is a father son film mainly though"
3,this movie was great but sick,this movie is not a movie for any child under the age of 8.this movie was sick but it was very funny
2,Not his best work,"I think that this movie was funny; however, it wasn't Jim Carrey's best work. The plot made little sense and was a bit corny. Carrey's courtroom behavior was extremely funny. The rest was just a bit stupid. Funny comedy is great, but stupid comedy makes you want to stop watching."
5,This movie KICKS A$$ !!!!,"This movie is so cool. Jim Carrey is the best actor in the world!!! If you havent seen this movie, make sure you do SOON!! I guarentee that you will find this move hilarious."
3,"A wholesome,funny,family movie.","The hugely popular,though frustratingly underachieving at times,Jim Carrey,is on top form here in this wholesome and genuinely funny family comedy.He stars as an unscrupulous lawyer with a penchant for being a stranger to the truth.He gets his just desserts,however,with some hilarious results,when his neglected son makes a birthday wish that his dad has to tell the truth for 24hrs.Good,old fashioned type entertainment for all the family,a fun movie and especially so for fans of the manic Jim Carrey."
4,"A very funny, mad-cap, zany, high-energy movie!","Okay, so Jim Carey overacts - just a bit, mind you, in this otherwise hilarious movie about a lawyer dad who has lived his life telling one lie after another; causing him to continuosly break promises to his five year old son. However, once his son makes a birthday wish that prevents his dad from lying - the fun REALLY begins! In the style of Jerry Lewis, Jim Carey brings plenty of physical comedy to this movie. Liar, Liar is jam packed with funny, funny lines, and Carey's facial expressions, high energy level, and comedic timing lend themselves perfectly to the script. I guarrantee if you watch this movie, you will laugh! I'm not lying when I say, IT'S A GOOD ONE TO WATCH, OVER AND OVER AGAIN!"
4,Tell the truth,"This is a solid movie. There are bloopers at the end of the movie and I imagine it would be funny to work with Jim Carrey. I was wondering what it would be like if for one day everybody in the world had to tell the truth. I imagine it could hurt a few relationships, but it would probably improve most of them. It would be fun to see a politician or celebrity have to be totally honest for a day. Jim Carrey turned down the role of Dr. Evil in Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery to be in this movie."
1,Unbelievably awful,"This film is absolutely awful,yet again they have made a film featuring Carey that is nothing other than him pulling faces and making stupid noises,usual plot of single mum and gooey child and over acting dopey boyfriend,Carey playing unattentive father,this is the second Carey film i have attempted to watch when theres no drying paint to watch,did not even manage to last twenty minutes of this one before switching off....avoid like anything...please...."
2,THIS IS WHERE CARREY'S MOMENTUM SLOWED DOWN,"IN THIS MOVIE, A LAWYER [JIM CARREY], WHO'S A CHRONIC LIAR, MAKES A PROMISE TO FULFILL HIS SON'S BIRTHDAY WISH, WHICH IS TO BE HONEST ABOUT EVERYTHING HE SAYS FOR A WHOLE DAY. THE PLOT IS KINDA CLEVER, BUT THE MOVIE AIN'T THAT FUNNY. I PERSONALLY THINK THAT THIS MOVIE WAS MEDIOCRE AND THIS IS WHERE JIM CARREY BEGAN MAKING NOT SO GOOD MOVIES. BUT, IF YOU RENTED OR BOUGHT THIS MOVIE, IT'S NOT A TOTAL WASTE. AT LEAST IT IS REMOTELY INTERESTING."
1,possibly the worst movie i've ever seen.,"I must say that after watching this movie I was almost compelled to believe that lying and cheating causes only temporary disasters. This is not reality, but this movie seems to encourage and advocate that even if you live a life of lies, you can make it in this world and everything will be hunky-dory. The fact that Jim Carrey basically destroyed his son's life but then makes everything up to him at the end when he finally keeps his word with him is hardly worth believing. And then, that he is able to get back with his wife in the end, after sleeping with numberous other women, and blatantly degrading her as a human, was to me, the funniest part of the flick. I found myself laughing not at the humor, but at the cold reality of how cruel and corrupt this world can be. This movie only encourages corrupt living and seems to attempt to rationalize that lying is A-ok as long as you tell the truth, once in a while. F-."
1,Doesn't work on Xbox!,I just got this for my son for Christmas and we are truly disappointed. It doesn't work in our Xbox. I did not say Xbox 360 but Xbox. The screen reads that this game is not supported. It makes no sense since this is allegedly for the Xbox.
4,Non-adjustble strap makes these feel more like slippers than shoes.,"I ordered a size 14 pair of these El Rey Sneakers because I liked the design plus the convenience of not having to worry about getting shoe laces caught in my bike when I head to class. Still, the top strap is non-adjustable, but rather just a rubber band that goes around the top of the shoe. This makes these sneakers feel more like slippers and they don't give the snug/secure fit laced shoes normally give. I ran two miles in these yesterday just to see if they'd ever fall off in an emergency. They didn't, and I don't suppose they will. But they're certainly more loose-fitting than I'd like.Aside from that they're pretty comfortable. The rubber grip is great for my scooter deck but don't trust them on wet surfaces."
5,"Great product, and even greater timing!","Wow! I was so surprised to come in today (Tuesday) to find my shoes waiting for me! I had ordered them the previous Friday, and I wasn't expecting them to arrive so soon! But there they were!Anyway, with regard to the shoe itself, my feet are wider, so I found the middle split kinda split a little further than I expected, but that's nobody else's fault but my feet's. The shoe looked exactly as I had envisioned it (and as the pictures indicated). I would definitely buy from this seller again!"
4,El Rey,"Pretty much what I expected. A pair of sneakers delivered on time. Thank god. Had the not arrived on time, I would have had to walk to Los Angeles with no shoes."
3,Great casual shoes.,The only thing I was dissapointed about was that there was some brown markings on the white sole. It wiped off no problem. But brand new shoes shouldnt have to be wiped off straight out the package. Other then that they are great!
5,Great Product,"I absolutely love Puma shoes, I've owned about 7 pairs over the years and they have always been quality items. With this pair, what you see is what you get. Simple black shoe with black rubber band across the top. They're comfortable for an average day's worth of walking, but I wouldn't wear them for times when I know I will be on my feet for hours. They're designed more to be casual with a simple/minimalist appearance to them, which is what attracted me to buy the product. I'm very happy with this purchase and looking forward to buying another pair of Puma shoes in the future."
3,before sponsorship?,"I ordered duckmen videos 10,13,14 for my husband's birthday. This video was before their Benelli sponsorship, which may be why the video quality is very poor. You can't hear them talking and the video isn't the best quality. The ducks are far off and whoever is videotaping is standing behind a tree for a good part of the video, so you get a lot of tree bark. The video is just like if you had taken a home video of yourself duck hunting, which is fine, but you get spoiled on high quality videography w/ the later Duckmen videos, where you can see the ducks coming in and what type they are, and hear Silas and Jase arguing (that's definitely worth listening to!)."
5,Terrific for a child eager to learn to read,This little book points out the many ways your child is already reading. It is a tremendous confidence builder for a child who is ready to learn to read in earnest. My 5 year old has read and re-read it and it provided a terrific gentle introduction to the subject.
4,tattoo magazine,I ordered this for my nephew and so hope that he will enjoy having it delivered to him overseas! Thanks for your efforts.
3,eclectic and a fun but short read,"Not Taibo's best work but an insightful view into differences between anarchists and communists of the 1920's and 30's. Overall a fun, short read."
5,The Baby Classic - A review of J&J's Baby Shampoo,"I remember my mother using this shampoo to wash my hair when I was small. And no doubt her mother used it on her hair. It is just the sort of classic that gets passed down from generation to generation.However, as a nervous first time mom, I took nothing for granted and looked into the 'no tears' claims myself. Sure enough, most of my mom friends swore by it; and I was reassured that it was gentle by the fact that the hospital used it too (even on the preemies].And now, having used it extensively (LOL), I can say this is an excellent shampoo for babies and young children. It has a nice light scent and cleans well, even on the dirtiest kid days.Five Stars. The classic baby 'tear free' shampoo."
5,Wonderful!,"The most outstanding facet of this book, I found, is the way that it was put together combining numerical facts with historically accurate details. The book gave lots of information without making me feel like it was only full of statistics. It's a true biography, combining both Bob Feller's private life and the public's view of his career. I would suggest this book to not just baseball fans, but any fan of history as well. Its a definite must read."
4,Pleasantly surprised,I was given this book as a gift from a good friend. I thought it might be full of baseball statistics - I found it to be not only informative but entertaining. Many times during my reading I had a smile on my face or was laughing about a comment Mr. Sickels made. It was very enjoyable reading.
4,Very entertaining,"What you will get in this book is a very entertaining, well-written drama about one of the great pitchers of his era. A truly American story that needs to be remembered.What you will not get in this book is the (unfortunately) typical game-by-game descriptions that permeate so many baseball histories these days. You know the tedious, convoluted kind of writing I'm talking about: ""Smith grounded out. Jones hit a long fly to left that Weaver caught on the run. Williams lined a single to left. O'Neal bunted Williams to third. Shore dribbled a liner past the third baseman Davis, who threw to Larry at short to double up Jackson, who had pinch run for Doyle, who was still suffering from a hangover."" Fortunatley, this book has none of that."
3,THE NOMAD QUEEN,"This was an excellent fantasy novel published in April 1993 about Sheela Queen of the Thorgon's (a northern barbarian tribe). The story begins with the defeat of Thorgon by Rhodia, and centers on Sheela's growth as a queen and her quest to gain allies needed to free her people. Unfortunately, after she gains the first of her requisite allies, the book ends with ""Chapter One"" of the sequel, ""The Palace of Evil"". Because the sequel slated for July 1993 was never published, it leaves the reader with the frustration associated with reading part of a novel."
1,Disappointed,"It didn't help at all. I was really hoping it would, but nothing changed after taking the whole bottle. I was very disappointed."
5,GREAT PRODUCT,The review for the newer model of this processor helped me decide to buy this older model and boy am i glad. I have had the older one for 22 years and finally broke it and had to have a new one and what fun it is to have a new sharper blade. Works great and is so easy for small jobs. This is NOT a big processor but is great for chopping an onion or making hummus. I have used my sister's bigger Cuisinart and this little guy is so much better for small jobs.
1,Use Common Sense - this is not an almost $20-quality album!,"I would give the book overall a 5-star rating - but the two that I have were bought for MUCH cheaper. This is now way too expensive to recommend! There is nothing special about the book - it's cute but rather than spend $19 just buy a plain one, I promise your baby will not know the difference. The handle is nice but again not worth it! I looked to find the same photo book offered for less on Amazon but did not see a way to buy it for less. There are several cheaper options available from other sites.Boo to Amazon for changing suppliers on this product and not using common sense!"
4,Play with grownup stuff without breaking it! WOW!,"I bought this album for my son's 1st birthday. He adores it. He likes to point at the pictures of his Mama & Dada, the puppy, Sade kitty, and his relatives. At the same time, the treasured pics aren't getting full of apple juice and cheerios. A brilliant idea!"
1,Lousy product,"I'm appalled by the lousy quality of this photo album. Ugly plastic that makes the pictures look blurry, absurd format, stitches so badly done that you can't even put the photos inside entirely... Plus you're supposed to ""tuck a small plastic flap"" behind the photo... what plastic flap? No plastic flap. Remind me to tell everybody NOT to buy this product. The people who manufacture it should be ashamed!"
5,Really cute!! Very bright colors!!,"I gave this to my infant grandson for Christmas (with family photos in it). Don't know if he liked it (<:but I thought it was really cute!! It was difficult to slide the pics in...but that's a good thing, because he won't be able to pull them out!"
2,don't let the battery run down...,"or it will erase everything on it. and when you try to restore it from the memory stick backup, the datebook and phone numbers are restored but all the third party applications need to be reinstalled from scratch. in the 21st century with cheap static RAM (compact flash, smart media, memory stick!) this is inexcusable. oh, and another thing, you can't run an application from the memory stick. and the mp3 player doesn't read ID3 tags. overall this thin is a bunch of hype. i wish these handheld companies would take care of the basics before sticking on a digital camera or some other useless feature. still the palm platform is not as mature as my 10(!) year old Apple Newton..."
5,The Best Handheld yet,"I absolutly love this thing. I have had a Palm VII before this and that was great too while it lasted. It just didn't have enough memory and it had a black and white screen. I was about to buy the latest Palm the Palm m505 with the colored screen but when I saw this I was just so astonished by its magnificence I had to have it. I just love the mp3 player, the high res color screen, its super small size and its stylish looks."
4,Hold Button for MP3,"As a correction to my previous review of 7/12/02, I just discovered that the Sony Clie PEG-N760C does indeed have a ""hold"" button which locks the keys while the MP3 is playing. This prevents the MP3 player from stopping if any of the buttons are accidentally depressed; and -- by turning off the display -- it keeps the batteries from draining too quickly.I apologize for this omission in my earlier review."
2,Not very impressed,"When I first got this Clie, I was very impressed. Overall it is a good product, but putting songs on the memeory stick was a huge hassle with Sony's check in/check out program. I finally found out how to attach it as a drive to my computer and then you can just copy songs very easily. One month after I purchased this product, Sony came out with two new Clie's, though they seem to be priced to high, I felt cheated. I would recommend getting a Palm m515. First I like the idea of media cards where you can upload a map or whater you want. Also, most other accesories are geared towards a Palm product. I wanted to get a cheap GPS add-on for the Clie and it doesn't exist. Altough I have seen one for a Palm. Once again, I feel cheated out of a cool feature. I think I will sell it on Ebay and get a m515."
2,"Bought it, Could not find accessories for it, Returned it!",I bought this handheld after seeing its impressive screen. I tried to find accessories for it (like a case without messy velcro) and could not find anything. It wasn't even because they were out of stock...they don't sell the decent accessories for it in the USA. The only way to get half way decent accessories is to find someone in Japan! I found myself wishing that I stayed with the Palm pilots (every where I went they had TONS of neat accessories to pick from). I returned the clie and bought a Palm M505 and now I am happy. I have been able to find everything that I want and need to have (plus some other extra goodies). I still like the screen of the Clie MUCH BETTER...but to have to worry about carrying it around without a case...is not for a busy working mother of two!
1,Sony The Under-Achiever,I was extremely dissapointed the price was too high but the quality was low.
2,Not a plant ID book,"If you are looking for a book with beautiful color photos of northeastern U.S. wild flowers, then this book will serve that purpose well. However, this is not what I would consider a helpful identification book. Many of the photos are close-ups of just the flowers which gives no sense of scale. The close-ups also mean that the leaves/vegetative parts of the plant remain a mystery. The text is kept to a minimum for each species. There is plenty of room on the page for more information, but the authors have left that space for the reader to make notes. The information that is provided is very sketchy in terms of habitat, identifying characteristics, and so on. Obviously a book of this size can't have everything, so the authors have sacrificed information in favor of visual stimulus. So enjoy the nice color photos, but don't expect to get much more out of this book."
4,buy your older Fashion Fevers while you can,I am suprised that there are any of these lovely dolls left to be bought. the eyelashes and great dresses have made them very popular with collectors and the change to the shorter body on the Fashion Fever dolls has made the older taller ones even more sought after than ever. The image shown doesn't do this doll justice
3,Pigeon John love him or hate him,"I also seen this cat at A Living Legends Show with JEDI, in Vancouver. Show was ill. and this dood does remind me of K-Os quite a bit, but hes got his own style, really hype, keeps the crowd live, or at least tries to. And the track he did with Legends at the show was LIVEEE. i picked up the album right infront of John and was like who the hell is this pigeon john guy, not knowin it was him right infront of me, so i grabbed it and got him to put his john hancock on it. hes got some good opinions on whats comin outa cali and vancouver. definetly worth it for 10$"
4,Something New,I really enjoyed listening to this cd. It was like a breath of fresh air listening to something new that was actually good.
5,Superb! Give this guy a listen!,"I saw Pigeon John with Matisyahu in Boulder, CO. He gave a great show--on par with Matisyahu. Pigeon John is quite the entertainer and gave an awesome show! I like the words to his songs, they seem to have a message and good vibes. Very hard working entertainer and fun! Check him out if you get a chance and get this CD--it is wonderful!"
4,Good overall,CD was in new condition as advertised. My only complaint is that it was not shrink wrapped.
2,Wack,"This dude is wack as hell, saw him at a show wit Jedi Mind and Legends, and this dude just sucked, I didn't hear him drop one real verse, he mostly just consisted of yelling put ur hands up,and when he said the only verse, it was a Mobb deep lines from shook ones, and he kept doing goofy ass little skits, which i might add were not funny at all. He also ended up getting Boo'd off the stage by half the audience. Dont even bother gettin his CD, i wanna hear hip hop, not some clown tryin to crack jokes."
3,Poor quality but nice dress - if it wouldn't have snapped,"I thought I was getting a three piece outfit. Wrong. On so many levels. I guess I didn't read carefully enough.It was one piece. It would have fit nicely if the jacket wasn't sewn to the cami. The stitches snapped when I tried to put on the top part of the dress! Therefore, it was not very good quality. You can actually see white underneath the dress now. Otherwise, it would have been okay. It was very pretty and very poofy. Returning it, as I just tried it on."
4,very good,"Good book. Worth the cost of a few lessons. Contains a lot of interesting licks and many ideas for variation and solo development.Bad things: Should have included left hand fingerings.Should have included complete theory behind the licks, e.g. some licks he is actually using licks that are based on a chord substitutions and passing chords, but he doesn't mention it. For a book like this it should have been mentioned. The uninformed reader would just think he is pulling them out of the air.Should have been more chapters on solo development.But still a very good book."
4,Not for beginners,"This book is 50 tabbed out phrases in different styles, and demonstrated with backing tracks on a CD. There is very little explanation about each phrase...just a short paragraph before each one. The phrases are intermediate to advanced. A beginner would be very frustrated. Fast phrases are played in both fast and slow speeds...medium and slow phrases are just played once. If you are already technically proficient, this is a good book. It does have nice phrases that will expand your repertoire. The phrases are called ""ideas"" and each uses a different technique. So it gets you to branch out. But this book does NOT teach you how to DO the technique. Only ideas on how it to use it. So you'd better know how to do it already!"
2,Ugly Riffs,"The books explains the theories behind improvisation fairly well, but most of exercise riffs included therein are unmelodic and unattractive to the ear."
2,Disappointing!,"A disappointing movie based on a pretty good book: a suspense yarn about an abandoned freighter. The book had some suspense, murder, insurance fraud, a down-on-their-luck 2 man salvage company, and an awkward love interest. Unfortunately, in turning the book into a movie the script writers jettisoned everything but the murder/insurance fraud part. The story's gutting leaves way too little to keep viewers interested. Gary Cooper's one millionth wooden, one-dimensional performance kills the story, which would have been better being told in flashback in order to keep viewers interested (ala ""Breaker Morant""). Instead, the too-slim plot is unveiled too quickly and without any suspense. Terrible! What a wasted effort by Charleton Heston and a young Richard Harris. Don't bother seeing this one."
3,Mary Deare,Old and dated movie but still like it. Interesting to see the stars of the 50's and 60's and compare to later films. Thought that the movie strayed too far from the book and therefore lost some vital character inter action along the way.
3,The book is better but the film is good too,We like the book better but watching Cooper and Heston is almost always aninteresting experience. The ship is also a character. It moans and groans in all the right times. The villain is not seen until near the end but could of beenportrayed in a more believable manner. The film did prompt us to reread thebook. That was a plus.
3,It's Hammond Innes,"In my younger days, I became a fan of the author Hammond Innes. He wrote adventure stories that I enjoyed immensely. The Mary Deare is one of his best, but the film doesn't do the novel justice. For an adventure story, much of it is slow-moving. Also Cary Cooper show his acting limitations. His performance is deadening. Charlton Heston, however, is quite good. All in all, only OK."
1,Zapatos viejos,Esta Película No Me Salió Muy Buena No Es La Orijinal Es Copia Y Se Ve Mas O Menos Mala :-(
2,Read the book - skip the video,"Throughout this video, the producers keep chanting the phrase ""Refer to the manual"". I agree - you should refer to the Garmin GPS III+ user's manual and skip this video. My reasons for this are as follows:- very few of the GPS's features are explored, and of those that are covered, there is not enough depth.- the computer interface is briefly mentioned but not described in any detail. Again, the viewer is referred to the manual.- the video is rather short and is lacking in essential detail.I gave this video two (2) stars because it does show you how to use the built-in simulator mode fairly well and, during the brief video, they associate the buttons you need to push and the screens you will see with the instructions. If they had spent 30 - 45 more minutes covering all the key features, I probably would have given this video a four star rating..."
2,Too Poorly Made for Everyday Use.,"We have a full line of Fiesta dishware and thought having the matching flatware would be nice. After a year of standard use and dishwashing, about 1/3 of the flatware is unusable. The upside is that it is cheap and replaceable. But count me among those who would rather pay more for something that lasts. We are in the process of ditching the Fiesta flatware line and moving to something more robust.PROS: Retro Stylish. Inexpensive compared to quality flatware.CONS: Very poorly made, Expensive if you need to replace 1/3 of flatware ever year."
1,Not worth it!,"I got service for 8 as a wedding present. That was 5 years ago. There are rust spots all over the steel and the plastic has broken on almost every piece. It started the first year I had them. I finally got new flatware this X-mas and am so happy to be rid of the bulky broken Fiestaware.This is the ONLY Fiestaware I've been unhappy with. My 18 mo. old son ""helps"" me with putting the dishes away and though something gets dropped everytime, nothing has broken."
5,"no problems, thru dishwasher regularly","I was surprised to read here that some have had oproblems with the quality of fiesta flatware. I have had mine for about 10 years now, in every color, running them through the dishwasher about once a week and have had no problems. Thr color has faded some on one of my sets of red -- I did notice I have two different shades of red now, but you wouldn't notice unless you put the two shades next to each other. I love Fiestaware, and love that my flatware matches my china. I did notice that they have changed the flatware design -- mine are rounded with the steel nub at the end. I noticed they are flat-handled now, with a raised design on the handle and no steel nub on the end. (Darn! I want to replace some missing forks, but don't want two different designs!)"
2,It Just Did Not Do it for Me,"When I was young I read every Alan Dean Foster book that I could find. I devoured his Commonwealth stories and constantly searched for books that I had not read. It has been about twenty years since I last read one of his books, so I was quite excited when I saw Drowning World on new books shelf in my local library.Sadly the excitement did not last past the first few chapters. The book felt stilted and lacked the sense of adventure that Foster'sbooks have had in the past. The story was well written, and the situation was plausible and clearly thought out, but I never found myself caring about the people in the book. Perhaps my expecteations were too high, or perhaps this is simply not one of Alan Dean foster's better works. Either way I will still eagerlyread his next book, but I doubt that I will ever reread this one."
3,Middle of the Road.,"I approached this book with enthusiasm but as i got into it my enthusiasm began to wane, the premise of this book was good, the characters sounded interesting, and the setting promised high adventure on an alien world. Alas the book failed to deliver on both points. Don't get me wrong it was an enjoyable tale, but the characterisation could have been soo much better, and the plot was a little to simple, and focused far too much on the uprising, and not on the three stranded beings lost in an alien jungle. The ending was entirely predictable and came way too soon, and without a single twist. It's like ADF was given a page limit and he was determined to stick to it. All in all not a bad Sci Fi tale, but could have been a lot better."
5,A Respectful way to parent,There are so many parenting books that don't help parents respect their children. This books gives practical advice on how to respectfully raise children who are responsible. It was well written with many practical ideas.
2,not what i thought,"Something about having ""family meetings"" and letting a child decide what the family should do for fun doesn't strike a cord with me."
1,Doesn't work,If this item is supposed to auto mute the detector it doesn't work. I didn't receive any instructions with it so I'm shooting in the dark with it - literally - if you press the button too many times it shuts the unit off.
2,"Works as advertised, but unnecessary purchase","I ordered this thing along with my purchase of a Whistler Radar Detector, because it was advertised on Amazon as a smart companion purchase and I assumed that I needed to buy it separately. When the Radar Detector arrived, it included a power cord, so the Intelli-cord was not really necessary. Amazon needs to make it more clear what's included in the package with the primary product. Admittedly, it offers a quick on-off button that is not found on the standard power cord, but it's just not necessary."
3,Just OK,I can't figure out how to make this cord do anything except turn the unit on and off. Since my detector is way out of reach I thought this cord would be crucial until I discovered a second power point in my car that switches off with the engine. Now it's really unnecessary. I wouldn't buy this again.
2,"Great workmanship, but these are not soft...","I am delighted with the promptness of the arrival of the toothbrushes. The workmanship is great, but I have two issues with the product. At 60, I have had many natural bristle toothbrushes. These, were the hardest that I have ever purchased. The bristles have not softened up, enough to use them without raking my gums, badly. That is issue #1.Issue #2, is that, even though I have a large mouth, the bristle area on these toothbrushes is SO large, that it makes it difficult to reach my back molars with it.I will use them, for scrubbing toothbrushes, but not in my mouth..."
1,The worst Tooth Brush Ever to Enter a Mouth,by far the worst toothbush ever madeAmazon Should not even offer this item it is so inferiorone brushing and the bristles became matted and tangled
3,"I love them, my husband hates them","I was looking for a natural alternative to sythentic brushes. This one fits my bill perfectly. It is a little rough, yet gentle on the gums at the same time. The head is quite a bit larger than mainstream toothbrushes that I am used to. My husband complains that the bristles fall out, but it hasn't been a problem for me. I've been using mine for 3 months now and it shows very little wear, which is much more than I can say for my husband's synthetic bristled one."
3,Toothbrushes...?,"I was very excited about these brushes, and they were alright; but after approx. 2 to 3 weeks the bristles begin falling out. If you are willing to change ultra frequently your toothbrush... then they are great!"
2,British Invasion - 1960s & 1970s,"A bit disappointed - it had less titles than I thought it would have because in the description it said ""...and many more""."
1,The British Invasion - 1960s & 1970s,"Terrible! Absolutely a hugh disappointment. Quality, awful. I already threw it out - a complete waste of money. Should not be in your inventory for sale."
5,CLASSIC!!,This is Z-Ro's older material.. Which in my opinion is when he had a better flow in his songs!This a must have for your Z-RO collection!
2,Skimpy on substance,"I returned this book because it seemed rather disorganized and fluffy. I wanted some suggestions for things to include in a ceremony, but most of these suggestions seemed impractical or irrelevant, or incompletely explained."
5,Rate the music...,"...based on the music; not on your grievance. Like everything else by O.B., it's great. And three songs not on any other cd's as far as I can tell."
5,Awesome Mr.Clean,"I love Mr.Clean scrub pads .With the handle you can reach hard to reach places ,it has a pleasant smell and scrub really well"
1,Where is my purchase?,I would love to review this book but unfortunately am not able to because I have still not recieved it. It is a gift and would love to be able to give it to the person I bought it for.
4,Solutions of string theory at low energies,"It's a rather impressive piece of work. However, despite the size, this book should not be counted as one of the textbooks of string theory. It focuses on various solutions of general relativity and its extensions - supergravity - which arise as low energy limits of string theory.The characteristic physics and mathematics of string theory (such as perturbative string theory and conformal field theory) is not discussed too thoroughly. In this sense, the book is not a competitor of Polchinski's ""String Theory"" or Green+Schwarz+Witten's ""Superstring Theory"", but it can still be a useful source of various classical solutions."
5,Beginers can now work like a pro,I was surprised by the functionality of Graphire2. The pen gives you excellent control and lets you do professional quality work. With little imagination and few days of practice you will be able to make great works ! It is almost as good as other (needless to say more expensive ) tablets. It is a snap to setup.It is worth its cost and more.
5,"works well for drawing, writing, etc. (and it's cheap!)","although many reviews say that you should spring for the Intuos2, since it has more room, i don't agree. this little tablet has all the room i need. it has enough features to keep me going for a long time, and it works very well with Mac OS X 10.2's Inkwell, so i can write into any application and it turns it into text for me. the tablet's mouse isn't that great, but i don't see many people buying it for the mouse anyway. still, with a good little pen(with an eraser), a great list of features, and a low price, this is definetly a tablet that even the most amateur computer user would appreciate."
5,Not just for graphics,"After developing RSI from using a mouse, a week of the Wacom tablet relieved the pain in my arms (combine this with a Nautral Keyboard and you'll be all set). The natural position of your hand and arm will help immensely.I also spend hours and hours on the computer designing websites and editing images, the ease of use of the stylus (and mouse very rarely) makes this process bearable.Larger tablets aren't always necessary for everyone and I've used a 4x5 for about 10 years now with no problems.This is a seriously great product (and cross-platform as well...)"
5,"""A.G. y D.G."" Antes y después de Graphire2","Luego de comprar Graphire2 me pregunto cómo he podido trabajar en Photoshop, Fireworks y PhotoPaint sin esta herramienta.Ciertamente no fue fácil acostumbrarse a usar un lápiz en vez de un ratón, pero como andar en bicicleta, una vez que le ""coge el golpe"", todo va como una seda. Ya mi frente no suda cuando retoco los bordes de una fotografía :-)Reconozco que dudaba por el área pequeña de la tablilla, pero es todo lo que necesito, con mi monitor de 21 pulgadas.De hecho, ni siquiera uso el ratón inalámbrico con que viene este producto, aunque sí lo saco del cajón cuando viene mi nieto a visitarme, le fascina que no tenga cables!.Un producto indispensable para editar imágenes, con excelente funcionamiento considerando que su precio es el más bajo de modelos similares del mismo fabricante."
1,for the mac,"I owned two of these awful tablets. I have 2 MAC, ever since I upgraded my MAC to OS10.2 this wacom tablet went mad! Its precision that I normally relied on has gone! The crosshair on the screen shakes all the time. I can't do any of those small drawing that I normally do. It works great on a PC which I don't own. I changed all the setting and play around with many different setting but no luck. Even after I update the software still dose those awful things!"
5,Great Idea.,"I love this. I don't have to worry about blankets and them falling off or even having to remeber to grab them as I walk out the door because the Bundle Me is already in the car seat, and my baby doesn't get too hot in it either."
2,Zippers break too easily,I was able to use my Bundle Me Lite 3 times before washing it (according to the directions on the tag). The zippers then fell apart when I tried to put it back onto the car seat. I went to the dry cleaner/tailor and had them replace the zipper because my daughter really loves being zipped up in the sack. Zippers need to be better quality!
2,Zipper quality should be better,"This is a nice piece, I used it from the May thru June with my newborn in New York and it was very convenient and just warm enough for that time of year, however as soon as we tried to wash it the zippers fell apart and I had to throw it away. The company needs to improve the zipper quality."
2,Poorly made zipper,"After only one wash, the zipper broke and is completely unusable!I did love this product, and recommended it to a pregnant friend, but it breaks too easily and is not worth the money!!!"
5,A Must Have for Winter - Even in California,"I bought the bundle me lite for our baby boy who was born in January. We live in California, but it gets pretty chilly and rainy, so this lite version was perfect. I liked the soft cotton knit lining and the weather resistant outer cover. The best part was, I didn't have to bundle the baby up in so many garments to travel from indoors to outdoors, and the bundle me doesn't fall off or flap open like blankets would.Unlike some of the other reviewers, we had no problems with the zippers or with the size. I think this product is a great value, and I'm buying another for a baby shower gift."
2,Too Small!,I loved the Original Bundle Me and used it with my newborn through out the NY winter months so rushed to get a Bundle me Lite for the summer. Much to my dissapointment it's so much smaller then the original and doesn't fit my infant carrier. My son is only 2 months old and his feet already reach the bottom of the sack. I will deffinately be returning it.
1,Very disappointed with this product,"I have the original winter-weight Bundle-me and love it. That's why I bought the summer weight version. What a mistake! The summer-weight version bears no comparison to the original. First, the zipper doesn't unzip from the bottom like the original one does. That means you can't have the bottom open which means your baby always has his/her feet enclosed! This is a problem on warm days, or if your baby is long and feet need to stick out! The material is that of a flannel-lined windbreaker -- ok, but it slides all over the place and is not comfy for the baby. Finally, it's so much smaller than the original! Our baby (6 mos) still fits in the original one, but is already too long for the summer one! What gives?"
2,Interesting,"This book is a bit of PR for the Williamsburg furnishings line but overall it has some merit. If you live in an older home and want to understand how people lived in these homes, this is a great book. I did not like the continous plug of the Williamsburg line of furniture and fabrics. It was excessive but the photography is excellent and the writing well done. I would of like to see more contemporary interiors that were not the same sofa in multiple rooms but an actual house of that time with current owners living in it in a modern way."
3,Not that great,"I couldn't wait for this book to arrive, however I was disaapointed in it because I was hoping for a little more decorating ideas for my living room. There wasn't a lot of useful material in this book for me. I usually try to buy books online that allow me preview a few pages. I think I'll stick to previewing all of my online book orders and skip the ones that do not allow a sneak peak."
3,"adequate, but basic; limited appeal","This is not the type of book that captured my interest. I found it too basic and of limited appeal, although it is a solid work and may be more useful for a beginning gardener."
5,Another good bus conversion guide.,"This book is a good book to add to your bus conversion book collection to help you.A collection of magazine articles put together to further your knowledge on converting buses.Dave Galey's advice will help you in the right direction.Factual information,diagrams,photos and printed on good quality paper make this book good value."
3,Marriage between Zones...,"This novel, the second in the Canopus in Argos series is a look at some of the zones alluded to in Shikasta, the first volume in the series. The Marriage is well written and interesting, between fairy tale and philosophy, and builds somewhat on conditions in the first novel. At a bit of a tangent however. It hints at the upwards reincarnation of souls where the levels of enlightenment live side by side although divided by barriers difficult to cross. Each level has problems of perception and thought that stall the rising of a soul towards its ultimate being. Zone five draws a parallel to Shikasta and hence to earth. The Marriage is required reading if you are going through the series, but is not as thought provoking or as original as Shikasta. Fortunately, the third novel brings you back to the original settings and gets you really thinking again."
5,Great toddler book,"My 21-month-old son adores this book. The illustrations are bright and cheerful. The story has fun sounds to make, and he learns to count throughout the book. A wonderful toddler book."
5,"Charming illustrations, perrfect for bedtime reading","Little Quack's New Friend by Lauren Thompson and illustrated by Derek Anderson is a completely delightful children's book. The bright cover got me to bring it home from the library and the clever story entranced my 3 year old daughter. Little Quack and his siblings: Widdle, Waddle, Piddle, and Puddle meet a new friend Little Ribbit, and they play together. The illustrations are amazingly charming, the words just repetitive enough for my daughter to enjoy what's coming next without me wanting to tear out my hair, and even my twelve year old daughter sat through a reading. My husband declared it adorable. It has a sweet, easy message of getting along despite our differences which is perfect for this age group. I've ordered other books in the series from the library, and if they are as good as this one, they will probably become Christmas presents."
3,Less for more,I could have gotten a 3 pack at the store for less. It would be nice if it were sold in bulk without having to buy 10 or more.
1,cane way to late,while the product was exactly what i was looking for it came so late i did not know where the package was for so long
4,Windows NT Desktop reference. By MSFAQ.com,"This is one of the most convenient books that I have ever touched. It brings the power of the command line into the hands of the common man. It's ultra small size makes it easy to toss it in your bag and bring it along to read over when waiting around for life's little interruptions. It is well laid out with a very useful and concise index. The commands are broken up by topic and sorted alphabetically. If you think you know it all, get this book, it will show you how wrong you are. I kept browsing through it and finding really cool ways to do things all from a command prompt. O'Reilly also throws in keyboard shortcuts and GUI tips and tricks. It is books like this that gives O'Reilly such a good reputation for useful and well-written books."
4,Shocked and Amazed,"SPOILER ALERT**Cronenberg's movie M. Butterfly is full of unexpected twists and turns. The French-American diplomat Rene Gallimard has fallen for a Chinese Opera singer. They embark n a lusty affair that ends in an unprecedented event. Song Liling, the Opera singer, is betraying Rene in more ways then one. She is using him to gain information on American troops in Vietnam. He has no idea that she is using him and he has no idea that she is actually a HE. When Rene ends up in prison, he uses a Madame Butterfly backdrop to commit suicide. This movie was well acted and directed. There were many subtle hints to Liling's masculinity, but there was nothing too bold as to give away the climax. This movie is a surprising take on Madama Butterfly that will linger in mind as a very different and intrguing drama."
5,Baby's Favorite,This is my daughter's and her cousin's favorite toy. All the Sassy toys have been really loved and played with. She doesn't get tired of it. I would buy this for baby gifts.
4,Good grippable toy,"Even though my 3 month old daughter was large (95th percentile) with big hands, we had trouble finding toys she would grip and hold on to. This toy is one of her favorites. She can grab it, either by the large outer ring or by hooking her fingers in one of the smaller rings, and it has many interesting textures for her to chew on. She enjoys chewing on the soft rubbery areas as well as the bigger red ball.The ring shape is also useful for her at this stage. She's just figuring out the hand-to-mouth coordination, and with straight toys she sometimes pokes herself in the face with the toy when she's trying to get a part of it in her mouth. With the shape of this toy, she is always successful at getting some part of it into her mouth."
3,My baby got frustrated and cried playing with this rattle,"My baby is about 7 months. He had the rattle for over a month now. Everytime he plays with it, he would get very happy initially (he tries to put it in his mouth), but then after a while, he would start crying. It seems he's frustrated. Maybe he couldn't get any piece of it in his mouth (since all the pieces are circular ? ). Sometimes it becomes a bracelet and he couldn't find it and so starts to cry. Anyway, I think it is a very well made toy and very colorful. But probably just not for my baby."
5,Great Product!!,"I LOVE this product. I used to play Dominoes with my grandmother, and now I'm playing it with my grandson! It's easy for him to understand, and a little math gets in there as a bonus. We even build things with them. I'd give this a 5+!"
5,improvised music is an acquired taste...,"like rockhound's mama.this release ain't a rock record and nobody claims to be a songwriter on it. somebody who is expecting it to be neat and clean and orchestrated is going to be disappointed. this record does fall within the continuum of modern free-improvised minimalism and texturalism, and in that context it's a very nice record. rockhound should stick to his alanis morrisette and creed records - don't leave your house, man, it's a scary world out there!"
5,Great compilation of Photoshop essentials!,"I couldn't ask for more when working with this book! Humorous, well written and organized. This book is a must step to becoming a photoshop guru :)"
4,Classic Effects means Old Effects,"It's like a chapter from Joy of Cooking--always useful, because the basics never change. But don't expect techniques that take advantage of the latest CS versions of Photoshop. If you're an experienced Photoshop user, there are many more advanced books that would be better. However, if you're just starting out, you are guaranteed to need every technique outlined in ""Photoshop Classic Effects""."
4,Nice,"down and dirty how to book for common images that are created. I like short cut keys as much as the next, but it's a little overboard on the book. All in all, I would recommend this book"
5,All you need to know in a way you need to know it,"Even good cooks open cookbooks for their favorite recipes. Scott Kelby makes it easy to access your favorite effects. In fact, he does it twice, once in full form, and again at the end in a ""cut to the chase"" cheatsheet. I was going to wait and see if he updated this CS version for CS3, but I'm glad I didn't wait. Like all of his Photoshop books, instructions are full-color and broken into logical steps."
5,Photoshop must know's,"This book teaches lots of the most classic (and often basic) Photoshop tricks. Some are very easy, some not so, and some need some real practice. My most often comment to myself was, ""I wish I'd thought of that!"" And then I will come up with many different ways to use the techniques. There are tons of more advanced guides out there, but if you want to 'wow' a client without spending huge amounts of time... this is the book for you. Even if you know most of these, it is a great reference and reminder."
5,World of Romance - Richard Clayderman,This is a great collection of relaxing piano music -- mostly familiar love songs and movie themes. Richard Clayderman is an accomplished musician and gives a wonderful interpretation of these old classics. I used to play this CD at school to calm special needs students while they were resting. It's wonderful.
4,Another great 50's rock'n'roller you won't want to miss!,"It's surely a great package of songs from Conway and comprehensive booklet included as well. If you don't want to buy 8CD box set from Bear Family called ""The Rock'N'Roll Years"" then try this one."
2,Poor Prose.,"After reading Jennifer Bryant 's Pieces of Georgia (a worthwhile read), a book written in stanzas, I combed my library for another book written in a similar manner. I came across Girlhood and couldn't wait to read it.Sadly, I was quite disappointed. The problem with this book isn't so much the story, it's how it's written. Smith puts forth an extremely obvious effort to come off as arty and thoughtful, but the result is distracting words and obnoxious titles for every page that get in the way of the story. The book itself isn't that bad, it's all cliché of teenage novels, nothing amazing, nothing out of the ordinary.If you choose to go ahead and read this book, just be warned: you have to work through it.Would I read it again? Most likely not. Would I recommend it? Sure... if I didn't like the person I was offering it to =P"
5,GREAT monopod,"I carry this monopod extended to my eye level, pro size SLR with 500mm reflex lens mounted, ready to shoot wildlife. I carry it at my side, by the foam grip, ""suitcase"" style. The ball head has NEVER slipped under the weight of camera/lens load. THAT alone rates five stars. But, to add to that, I recently was on a hike where the trail got EXTREMLY steep for about a 1/4 mile. I thought to myself that this, being so steep, is actually go to be HARDER coming back down. I kid you not, thank God I had this monopod. I used it as a hiking staff on the climb back down the trail. Great.. Great..Great !!!!"
4,Good quality monopod!,I wasn't expecting it will be this strong and rigid for the price. It is also light to carry. I just need to buy the quick snap release for convenient.
2,Not a lot of content,"This book contains reproducible mini-books, bingo cards, flash cards, some word search puzzles and fill-in activities. In my opinion, the fill-ins are a bit too challenging. I even had trouble with them. The only thing in this book really ""worth it"" that I couldn't make as well myself, are the mini-books. The mini-books each contain several different sight words, so they seem to me to be more effective for review of words the student has already learned than in the initial learning of them."
1,Save your money!,"This was a terrible disappointment and a complete waste of money ($6 for one-and-a-half pages). It is not at all about interviewing techniques, but instead a rambling stream-of-consciousness ""oral history"". It may be an interesting story, but it is NOT as described. There is only one line in the article that can possibly be considered ""technique"" and it is not very helpful -- just a reminder that all interviewees are as human as the interviewer. Please do not spend time or money on this."
3,mediorce,"at first i loved these.. they have great sound.. especially when you get a good ear seal.However, they tangle a lot if you wad them up in your pocket. or roll them up to take somewhere.They don't last long either, and don't have a mic...so you have to pull out the phone to talk.Fine for a mp3 player though...too expensive compared to a few of the others that are way better."
1,stay away,"Left earbud went out after 2 months. Really disappointed, because they were a very good fit for my ears. Koss has a lifetime warranty, but you have to pay shipping +$6 check for the replacement, so, not worth it."
2,Would not buy again,"Recently purchased the Koss earbuds to use in noisy areas. Two things I do not like: tinny sound compared to other lower cost earbuds and unequal length wires to each ear. I can't imagine a situation where having one wire twice as long as the other makes the earbuds more comfortable. With small ear canals, the smallest silicone adapters fit comfortably."
3,"Excellent Sound & Fit, but","Where the cord splits to go to each ear, one wire is short and the other is long. This drives me crazy. I have tried to get used to it but can't. I have never seen this setup before."
3,Great set of earphones,"Was disappointed in the poor volume level of this item. Other earphones I use had twice the level. And these are inserted in the ear canal so that very little sound escapes.Lo and behold, another user showed me I had them in BACKWARDS. The end of the bud that LOOKS like it has the speaker is actually the side you use to insert the bud into the ear. No wonder the sound volume was low. Once I swtiched things around and decided that the cushions didn't actually fit on the wrong side of the bud (it is reasonably symmetrical), then the sound was just fine. I wondered why my wife was saying the phones were pretty loud...the speakers were aimed toward her, not me. For some reason, I can't change the rating I gave it (Gave it a 3...would now give it a 5)"
2,Blah.,"These feel really awkward in my ears. I don't like them at all, the sound is completely flat aka NO bass. You can't turn the volume up very loud at all unless you want everyone around you to hear what you are listening to. On the plus side they uh.. look nice?"
4,Great for the price,"I'm no audiophile, but these sound better and are much more comfortable than the headphones that came with my MP3 player. My only complaints are:1. There is some noise from the wires rubbing on your chest when you walk or run with these on.2. The wires leading from the earbuds to the central wire are not symmetrical, looks and feels kind of goofy."
2,Poor Overall Performance,"Very disappointing performance from a great name in headphones and earbuds.Flat, tiny, limited bass response.Well made, but a poor performer. They do not do justice to the iPod Nano 4G."
2,bad quality,"I Buy 2, in less than 2 months was damaged, am listened to well but they are of bad quality"
4,"I love the sound, but....","They sound amazing, by far the best ear buds I've ever used.But they have the thing were one ear bud has a longer cord than the other, and this makes them hard to use; and they get tangled very easily."
3,not very effective for small ears,"These sound OK if the fit is good. However, I found it difficult to get a reliable and comfortable fit with either size sleeve. I think might have smaller than average ear canals, or maybe not round enough. I eventually took off the sleeves, and drilled holes in hunters' foam ear plugs, and slipped those on the driving elements. The fit was a little better, but at the expense of good sound, and they still popped out of my ears frequently. Nowadays I just put ear plugs in my ears, put on some cheap over-ear phones, and crank up the treble to compensate for the earplugs. That seems to work OK in my noisy work environment."
2,"Kills me to give a low review, but...","First off, these buds do sound great for the money, but I can't recommend them for two reasons. 1 - My second pair just broke, this is in 4 months, and I'm not abusive with them. 2 - The left ear just won't seat properly. I'll screw around with them and can't get it to sound right, then they'll just 'pop' into place, or moving my head will affect the sound. Sorry Koss, but I'll stick with the Spark Plug."
3,Good but,"Thought they have good sound and bass, after some months they just stop working. First the right ear and a week after the left one. They just stopped working when i was in a plane to venezuela to visit some family... so no much music while i'm here."
1,No Good,This product is terrible. I've only had them for 2 months and they already don't work 80% of the time. I find myself constantly messing with the wires to get the sound to come out correctly. I suggest Sony earbuds. Koss=crap. I'll never buy a Koss product again. But I guess I got what I paid for.
3,Great sound but...,"I purchased these to replace the standard iPod earphones after reading a favorable review. The sound is better and can be played at a lower volume since the earbuds fit snuggly in the ear. (Three earbud cover sizes are provided.). However, the earbuds are not centered. The wiring is in the form of a ""Y"". The branch to the left earbud is 5 inches long while the right is 21. I assumed this was a manufacturing error and returned the first pair I received. (Amazon was very accommodating.) The replacement pair is the same. If you are willing to overlook this difference and wear your iPod on your left side, these are good earphones at a good price."
2,Different length cords per ear kill my gym workout,"I like the fit and the way they sound, but the major defect is that the main cord splits closer to one earbud than the other, creating a lot of extra cord that flops around when i'm working out.It's so annoying I've gone back to the white Koss Plug model, which has even cords. What's more annyoing is the pics here don't show that that is the style of the cords. Buyer beware.Great product otherwise... sounds very good and I like the connection to my iPod and the feel of the cord itself."
2,last for 6 months then dead,these earbud works wonderful from the get go then start to malfunction. the good thing about it is that it has good bass and clarity. I guess 17 dollar worth for 6 months of daily use or maybe not. you decide!
3,"If they fit, they are good","The sound on these is pretty good, but I was only able to get it to fit properly in one ear. In my other ear, it just didn't want to stay in. With the ear that it did fit, it sealed well, and provided good bass response, etc."
1,not satisfied,i'm not satisfied with this product. there is half the bass than my previous sony earphones which i bought in nepal for $20.
5,Southwestern Mom,Bought this to take on a trip for those down times when something quiet is a good thing for everyone. This is a fantastic playset for kids very familiar with Curious George- great gift for 3 or 4 year olds! Lots of punchout pieces (best stored in a ziplock rather than the book's envelope). My 4 year old LOVES this!
2,Title is misleading,"I purchased this with the impressions it would be good for a foreign language teacher. I also thought there would be games in the book. The title would be much better if it said ""exercises and drills."" Very few of the suggestions in the book are truly games. For example, holding up an item and asking ""What is it?"" and answering isn't a game nor a contest. They aren't bad exercises and drills for an ESL class but few would work well in a foreign language classroom. The majority of the ideas are for younger, I would say 3rd grade or under, students.One idea that would work well would be to write an advise column (not really a game or contest though.) The game of professions and items used might be fun in a FL classroom. The explain items to a Martian would probably be fun in a FL as well.So, if you're a FL teacher, pass on this book."
5,Great snack!,This is a great late night snack for me replacing my usual pretzels. I get the crunch and salt without any work yet it is much better for me than pretzels.
3,Quick Read - Not Captivating,"This book was interesting but not the kind of book that you can't put down. The plot was a fabulous concept, but it just wasn't that exciting. I think Mendelson could have made Amelia's journey much more exciting and interesting--the fiction could have been taken to greater lengths."
2,Too Slight,"Jane Mendelsohn's first novel neither warrants the high praise given by other reviewers, nor is it without merit. This admittedly brief book is a series of moods and impressions that wash over one another, like waves on the island beach where Earhart is stranded. This is not a story for those of the action-picture mentality.Mendelsohn writes compact prose in winningly direct images: ""In the Electra the light is blue. There's a smell of gasoline."" But elsewhere, an effective metaphor in the opening pages reappears so often that it loses its power.There just isn't enough material here. Pages given over to epigraphs (Woolf, Defoe, and Bronte) and acknowledgements are too much like padding. In the end, this is an undemanding fantasy that will please many readers."
3,a nice beach read!,"I don't understand the high expectations going into reading this book, people unless you're Earhart fanatics. The shift between 1st and 3rd person, though unnecessary, didn't bug me, and I thought the way the author described certain things, like the sky as flesh and folding skirts of wind, were very nice...she also made some interesting though provoking observations/musings about life. Sure it wasn't a book that was taxing on the brain, but I was looking for that; I did not think this book was horrible, but found it rather pleasant.3 1/2 stars."
3,Doesn't merit the best seller list-Hidden Latitudes is beter,"I find it unfortunate that the book world focus's more on quantity than quality. This book competed with Hidden Latitudes, also a story about Amelia Earhart, that has a much better story line, and is very well written. Mendelsohns book, however, is very factual and dry, and shows very little of the vision that is required in good literature. Lucky for Mendelsohn, some big shot on the radio reccommended the book, and so she made it on the bestseller list. so yay for Jane, she hit a lottery ticket, whereas Alison Anderson's good novel was overlooked, and given reviews of ""Another Earhart novel."" When Knopf realized that Anderson's book would soon be in print, it upped the printing date for Mendelsohn...what a sleazy thing to do. It disgusts me that talent is so infrequently recognized these days, and we just devour whats in the consumer market."
4,"Wonderful, suspenseful","It is indeed an adept author who can not only create suspense when the reader knows the tragic outcome -- but can do it with changes of tense and temporality. I salute Mendelsohn for her writing abilities and descriptions. I will never forget some of her depictions of the sky, the most memorable of which begins the novel, ""The sky is flesh. . ."" It is a book of hope and redemption and reconciliation, made all the more enjoyable by hearing it as an audiobook. Loved it.Latayne C Scottauthor, Latter-day CipherThe Mormon Mirage"
4,An enjoable escape into the fantasy of Amelia Areheart's,"It is doubtful that anyone will ever know what actually happened to Amelia Areheart, so I thoroughly enjoyed this little novel. The author has presented ways that the aviator and her navigator survive on a remote island after her plane goes down. According to the author, Ms. Areheart, attempts to repair her plane, then abondons that idea for surviving, and eventually, thriving peacefully on a ""lost"" island. An enjoyab;e, fantasy account of what may have happened to a remarkable man. about how one woman"
2,Artsy--but not art,"The biggest fault of this little book (for me) was not the many licenses taken with the known facts. After all, it is a work of fiction, and a writer can make the South prevail at Gettysburg, for the sake of a good story. The real faults are in the very narration, i.e., the point of view shifts that are pretentious and annoying--and in the descent into romantic hogwash. Perhaps the readers of sappy romances will like the shift in Amelia's character and even believe it possible that such could occur, but it is not very satisfying to a reader who wants more from a book than sap. I just couldn't buy the premise, the point of views, and the denouement. I wish it were otherwise, because I wanted to like this."
5,A Small Gem from a Gifted Writer,"In an almost uncanny intuitive way this writer grabs the whole Amelia Earhart Lalapalooza --mystery, glamor, publicity whirlwind -- and turns it upside down, rendering a surprisingly convincing intimate voice, fictional surely but quite an accomplishment, of a lonely misunderstood woman who made her living by being a legend. I am over familiar with the facts of Earhart's life, close friends with members of her family descendants, yet this short novel pierced through the public persona and I heard a real woman's voice examining her own sad life and times in an unforgettably moving way."
4,A beautiful fairy tale about a real story,"This novel is the fictive rendering of Earhart's last voyage across the Pacific. The author tells us of an imaginary diary she wrote about her flight as well as about her intricate and eventually loving relationship with her debauched navigator. The reader is very much involved and feels part of the story, a yet to be solved mystery! Especially interesting for lovers of flying, as it allows us to understand the problems of technology and navigation of that time (1930s)."
1,"Complete trash, poorly written, torrid junk",I bought this book with the great expectation of a good read on Amelia Earhart. What I got was a torrid Blue Lagoon romance without any notion of reality or history. The writing was typical of the stuff that pours from the fanciful pens of young girls' and ends up in dairies.Do not waste your money of this terrible waste of trees.
1,Disappointing,"This was essentially a bodice-ripper with Amelia Earhart as the central character. Extremely disappointing. Lack of details about Earhart's life before the crash are the work of a lazy writer. The ""afterlife"" of Earhart post-crash is offensive."
1,Just plain bad,"Mendelsohn's book picks up where the known facts of Earhart leave off, answering the question of ""just what happened to Noonan and Earhart after they left for Howland Island?"" The plot line is razor thin, the writing style is straight out of a Harlequin romance novel, and the characters are cardboard cut-outs of real human beings. The book was bad. Really bad. Think ""Blue Lagoon"" meets ""Gilligan's Isle"" as a trashy dime-store novella, and you have a feel for the story. The only positive thing I can think to say about this horrible little book is that it is mercifully short."
3,Choosing a Perspective Would Be a Good Thing,"I WAS AMELIA EARHART has as its intriguing premise the idea that Earhart and Noonan being lost over Howland Island is not the end of the story. In this slight but earnest volume, that makes for a great start. It's only 145 pages, but it has the potential for packing a wallop.Unfortunately, the author is unable or unwilling to choose a narrator for her story, and it suffers as a result. At times it is in first person with Amelia speaking; at times it is a third person overview. The juxtaposition is jarring and, as a result, unsatisfying. If one speaker or the other had been chosen and committed to, this might have been a five star read, because the emotions and behaviors that are a part of the story are compelling indeed."
3,A wonderful book about a pioneer aviator...,"...this isn't it.This is sort of dreamy and stream-of-consciousness, very metaphorical, certainly lyrical, but not very satisfying if you're interested in Amelia Earhart herslf."
1,o stars if I could,"This is the worse sophomore release from any band I've ever heard!! What where these guys thinking? If they are gonna sell out they should change their name to Dis appointment, Dis missed,Dis aintdisturbed and so on .You get the point. Get back to the sound and lyrics that made you what you WHERE ""DISTURBED""!"
5,Disturbed decision!!!,I heard Disturbed and my first thought was metal is coming back and these guys are leading the way. Believe is one of the best metal albums of the year and Distured is above all ahead of the rest.
2,dissapointing,Out of 3 discs in this package two discs had Disc Error messages immediately upon inserting into camera. What a waste of 20.00
4,Looking for compatability,I purchased the correct brand for my camera because I was having a problem when trying to delete pictures from the cheaper brands and I was having disk errors that where not only inconvienent but caused me to loose some cherished photos. I can not say that this will not happen with the Mavica brand but so far so good. It's been around a month and no problems.
5,very quick delivery!,Sony Mavica CD-Rom are the best -- at first I panicked when I learned the CDR was discontinued but the CDRW was still available. Immediately ordered and the product was sent out to me within a day of my order. It arrived in great condition - brand new.
4,Best RV Sewer support I've had!,Excellent value for the money. Just as advertized! I like the clip and handle feature for easy storage when not in use.
5,Camcon sidewinder sewer hose support,Really should have purchased one of these long before I did. A must for anyone who RV's.
4,Solved my drainage problem,"My Fifth Wheel waste hose was lying about 3"" below the campgrounds sewer connection, meaning the hose was always full of refuse causing minor back-ups. The Sidewinder solved the problem. Highly recommend it to anyone with and RV. Stows easily and virtually indestructible."
3,OK,"The sidewinder sewer hose support should work OK in usual and standard circumstances. That being said, it is not adjustable in height. This is a disadvantage if the receiving sanitary dump pipe is higher than the low end of the hose support."
2,Broke 1st use,Used it the first time in cool temp not COLD and it snapped off about one and a 1/2 feet of it. Guess plastic is not the way to go with this kind of Item.
4,Easily adjusts to support sewer hose,I bought this sewer hose support because I have a small camper van and very little storage. This folds easily and fits in the small compartment in the back of the van. It was easy to open and adjust to fit the hose length. I previously had used plastic blocks and it was impossible to get the sewer line at the right angle to drain properly. This is a time saver for me. I highly recommend it.
2,Broke the 3rd time we used it.,Concept is great and it worked beautifully the first two times we set up our RV. Breaks too easily & we were very careful with it. Broke apart on the third use.
2,Not that great.,"I bought this and used it once. Setup was a breeze. Had it running under the motorhome. Then it came time to move it, and it broke at the cheap plastic hinge in two places. The hose was empty and not even on it. Not real impressed. This was bought somewhere else brand new, and was not it the sun at all. You get what you pay for I guess."
3,It Works Ok - I Guess,"This product is plastic and doesn't seem very sturdy, especially at the hinges. It doesn't deal well with any inconsistencies in ground level between outlet and sewer input."
4,"Grams, Her Boyfriend, My Family, and Me","This book explains how life can be complicated in some ways. Grams, Her Boyfriend, My Family, and Me gives a picture in kids minds of how life is about. It shows that you will have to take some responsibilities as you get older. It also says that there are some decisions that will be difficult to make. Some that you don't want to make but you have to. Some of the decisions are very big and some of them are not. You may regret some but that is the way it goes. This book goes through some decisions both big and small that some people will have to make in their lives. This book also has some difficulties that go on that could happen to people."
4,Mastering Mathematics,"Nice little text for reviewing the maths you've long forgotten or were never taught in the first place. It begins with the very basics and works upwards to more complex topics, which is great for those with limited mathematics background or ability. Buckwell provides comprehensive explanations and examples without being too long. It covers a surprisingly wide range of topics, though unfortunately there is no mention of logarithms. The exercises are good to work through."
4,Salsa at it's Best!!!!!!!,If you like salsa music you'll love this album....Makes you want to get up and dance. Definitely a must buy.
3,like a messy divorce!,Can't Jon and Ken.. just stop faffing about and get back together already!! The Posies were/are one of THE finest bands around.. and it pains me to see the guys like this.. all mopey and lonely sounding!.. Jon comes off the best on this EP with 3 corking tunes of pure fluffy delight!!.. Ken's stuff is better that that on the 'Touched' CD.. but by god.. if you can find a record label to release your solo work.. then sort it out and get the Posies back on track.. we need them!! Who else are Fountains of Wayne going to tour with?.. It was indeed a sad time when you broke up.. right off the back of Redd Kross and Jellyfish biting the dust.. fate is indeed a cruel mistress!!
3,Can't we just have another great Posie's CD?,"This is such a fanboy release if only there were fanboy's in the audience. They're just not that hip. I bought this. I listened to it once. Can't we just have another great Posies CD? The world is waiting for another ""Flavor of the Month"",""Frosting on the Beater"" and ""You Avoid Parties."""
5,Amazing New Legends!,"It's on a different level than 'Almost Famous'. Supposedly all these songs were done during February 2004 when all of the Legends joined together in Maui to record. Truly a ""Classic"" album!"
5,"Not for the ""Close-minded""!","While Dr. Cytowic's book mainly deals with his investigation of the rare neurological phenomena called ""synesthesia"", his resulting insights on emotions, reasoning and consciousness are really what make this book worth reading. He presents ""The New View of How the Brain Works"". A view that helps us understand the critical interaction of emotions and reasoning. If you are open-minded and ready to give an alternate point of view a chance, you will find this book to be truly enlightening, absorbing, thought provoking and enjoyable. If you are close-minded and think that science already has all the right answers - don't waste your time - try science fiction instead!"
2,I Tasted a Hint of Soap Box...,"I eagerly snatched this book off the shelf when I learned of it -- synesthesia is a fascinating subject with too few works devoted to it -- but Dr. Cytowic's tendency to climb onto his soap box took much of the potential pleasure out of ""The Man Who Tasted Shapes"". We are given details about only two people with the condition, and one of those only glancingly. The rest of the book is either written in coy dialogue form (taking scores of pages to relate an incident easily expressed in a paragraph -- padding, anyone?) or else denouncing other scientists' viewpoints. This is no ""Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat"" [by Oliver Sacks], as the title seems to imply. I was left hungering to know more about the actual subject: synesthesia. I did not necessarily disagree with Dr. Cytowic's views, but they seemed to have pre-empted another book already in progress.Janet Coleman Sides"
3,paperback book,my daughter needed this book for her AP psych class and for the price I paid it was better to order it than spending the gas money to drive to a library far away to get it. This way she could also highlight areas of the book if needed. She enjoyed this book.
2,Cytowic is a egotist,"While the book is supposed to focus on synaesthesia, it seems more to focus on Cytowic's views on the medical profession. In addition to the ridiculus interactions between people, he cuts down most people and finds a way to make himself seem intelligent and profound. When Cytowic did actually talk about synaesthesia it was clearly written and very interesting. Perhaps there wasn't enough to write about synaesthesia. Who knows..."
4,Out performs my old Passport!!!,"I like the way the Uniden LRD6275SWS picks up radar from the rear of my car. My Passport that I replaced did not have this capability. The only drawback that I can see in the short time that I've had the Uniden is the lights for the radar bands,SWS,and VG2 are hard to distinguish from each other. Overall I'd recommend this detector to anyone that is on a budget and didn't want to spend in excess of $150.00 to get the digital display's."
3,"good back, poor front, to many false alarms","Well, I use my model in Poland(Europe) and:1) it warns 3 of 3 at the top almost every hill of the highway wherever any cellural antenna propagate the mobile phone signal. No police insight.2) when passing by the police radar station it warns only 2 of 3 from the front (even face to face with the radar! ).3) it warns excellent (3 of 3) from the rear, even far away AFTER the police.The conclusion - place it back to the front to get better detection.I used very old uniden radar previously and it was much better than the current one. But maybe in future (I use it for just a week) something will improve. Today - tragedy."
4,A Good Read,"This is the 2nd in the Catherine LeVendeur series, and is every bit as enjoyable as the first. Edgar and Catherine are a great sleuthing pair, and the 12th century detail is fascinating. I also appreciate Newman's character development; even minor characters are well-developed and interesting."
2,A Very disappointing mystery,"I can't really judge if this is an accurate medieval setting, although it is a very vivid one. The problem here is the plot. At the end of the book, I am left completely baffled by the motives of the main actors. I won't discuss it in any detail, since I don't want to spoil the plot, but they must have been relatively stupid since they could have accomplished their purposes in a simple and straightforward way that would have avoided a lot of grief. A friend of mine would roll her eyes at this point and tell me that their motive is simple: if they behaved sensibly, there wouldn't be a plot. Silly me."
4,Peaceful lullaby,The purchase makes me feel satisfied as the CD has some nice collection of soft tunes. It makes the little ones relax and soothe.
5,A timeless classic,"This was the first, and sometimes only, soothing cd that helps our baby sleep. Very good production quality as well, which seems to be lacking in a lot of children's cd's."
4,These are what all the kids are asking for,"In the sense that these are what my son wanted, they fit the bill. It took him a couple of days flailing about but after he got the hang of them, they are pretty cool. I can't imaging them being comfortable if I just wanted to walk. Sketchers has a competitive product that the wheels can be retracted that I would choose if I were wearing them. These wheels have a tool that must be carried with if you want to remove the wheels. They are well made and have high quality materials."
3,Romping romantic fun,"Unearthed is a fast, fun, romping space adventure. It's space opera in a good way. Tess is the fiery-haired heroine who is abducted by the devastatingly handsome alien Cohl. Only Tess can save Cohl's father and his planet.The story is written with an upbeat pace that kept my attention. The characters are engaging and quick-witted. I loved Cohl's robot bodyguard! Wish I had one of my own!This is not a high brow science fiction novel. Don't look for minute details on quantum space theory or black holes. This is a feel good space adventure romance that doesn't take itself too seriously. Grab a copy and enjoy the ride.Thank you Carina Press and Netgalley for allowing me to review Unearthed."
2,Read like a video game script,"Parts of this book were great fun but the plot read like a Tomb Raider wannabe with lots of bad SF movie clichés tossed in for camouflage. Ms Barry seems to be write well, she developes nice tension between her lead characters, but her story would have been more enjoyable if set in an original universe and if she had spent as much time developing the Sci-fi part of her plot as she did on the Romance.As a reader who enjoys a well done Sci-Fi romance novel nothing bothers me more than novels where the writer's experience with Sci-Fi seems limited to media franchise fiction and video games. I wish people who didn't ""get"" the Sci-Fi part of the equation would just stick to straight Romance and the ones who want to write media tie-ins would try for the media market."
2,Not good quality,"I had this mower for 4 years, mowing about 1/2 acre every other week from April-October. I changed the oil every year, and kept the blades sharp. During the middle of the 2nd season, I started having problems with it. The last 2 years, I had to replace something every week. The spindles both broke (the casting cracked), the blades had to be replaced very frequently, the pulley brake on one side broke, the cable to engage the blades broke, the deck support rod cotter pins broke and the rods bent. The seat would not stay in place; I could crank down on the handle as tight as possible and it still slid when I went up or down hill. The mower finely died when the connecting rod shattered and completely destroyed the engine - everything but the intake was damaged. It was a good price, but you get what you pay for."
1,false information to customer,"They say its like new but is it not the book is so dirty and i'm afraid to touch it the way its dirty. How can some one sell something like that and put that it is like new , stop putting false report up and then when you get your stuff it not saying what you payed for."
4,Excellent portrayal of contempory time martyrs,This is the first book on the subject of catholic martyrs I've read. What caught my interest was the fact that these where people who lived in these times. The personal stories of people who actually knew these martyrs is tremendous.I would recommend this book to anyone who has an interest in learning about catholic martyrs of the church who lived there lives as we all should.Joe Malham comes off as someone who knows what he is talking about. I can't wait to read his next publication.Excellent! Excellent! Excellent!
2,Not What It Seems,"This book has great poetry entries but as far as being illustrated, it's scarce within the anthology. The title is a bit deceiving."
5,Escada Rockin Rio,Great light fruity scent - both my daughter and I get a LOT of compliments when we wear it. Very large bottle - great purchase
2,I believe it is a knock off!,"I can't prove it, but the one I bought at Macy's was much more subtle and also had a slightly different bottle. It has a slightly masculine smell that I didn't notice in my previous buy. Isn't a knock off illegal? Unless it says so and is less expensive, I believe it is, an SHOULD be! Well, I'd like to report to Amazon that I think this is an illegal knock off!"
1,Buy another drive,"When buying hard drives, price shouldn't be the main concern. Reliability is, otherwise, whatever you save on the cost of the drive will be spent (+ more) on getting your data professionally recovered. I learned the hard way, with this Fantom drive. If you search for reviews, you'll find that this model has a high rate of failure. Do yourself a favor and get a drive that's more reliable. That said, while it worked, the drive was great. However, it is the only hard drive I've ever had die on me and it's lifespan was only about 100 power cycles. Poor quality and my data paid the price."
3,Could be better,"I got one and within 7 months the drive stopped reading and I lost a lot of data. Fantom Drives sent me a new one free of charge, (I just paid shipping one way). They popped a new drive in there and sent back the old case with the new drive to me. They even skipped the FAT32 encoding which was nice.When I got it back I opened the case up to find it was a lower quality Western Digital drive inside. I still use it, but rely on my higher priced internal drives for main storage. This unit is just used for backups and stays turned off most of the time.Pros:- Outstanding price- Comes with USB and Firewire cable- Case is sturdy and built well- Very quiet and reads/writes fastCons:- LED on front panel is BRIGHT and quite annoying if you put this on the desk- Firewire cable is quite short and very thick/stiff- Cheap drive inside may give out at any time..."
3,"Excellent book, print only passable","As literature a good book, however the print is quite small, perhaps a 9pt in Times Roman and the print is not centered on the page. The print begins perhaps 1/2 inch from the top of the page while there is perhaps 2 inches at the bottom of the page. Reading is much easier when the text is centered and just a little larger, 11pt - 12pt would be a big improvement. Not large print - large print books are usually 16pt, just a little larger to make for ease of reading."
3,Not My Favorite Nabokov,"I bought this book hoping to find great insights into the work of my favorite Russian authors. In particular I had just finished Anna Karenina. I am huge fan of Nabokov. I adore many of his books. Pale Fire and Lolita are two of my favorite novels ever, but this collection of his lectures was fairly disappointing. It was thin on insight (there were a few) and long on retelling of the the plots. It's almost like a Nabokov cliff notes. Not what I was hoping for."
2,too expensive for the quality,"In the year that I have had this model I have had to talk to Customer Support eight times. Not only did I have to call them to help me with a problem, I frequently had to wait a long time (over 45 minutes) to get someone on the phone. Once I was talking to someone I either had a really bad experience or a so-so experince. For the amount of technical trouble I have had with this machine, I would never buy another Panasonic product again."
3,How smart do I need to be?,"Although I have called Panasonic and gotten assistance, after 4 weeks I am still unable to get the on-screen TV Guide to work. I am technology-saavy, and even had a friend help me with the unit. No luck. Programming recording without the TV Guide is fine, but that defeats the purpose of buying this machine."
5,Diamond Plate frame,I like this frame because it is heavy duty. I purchased it to protect my front licence plate from damage caused by the occasional automatic car wash. As a Firefighter the diamond plate is a standard we have on our fire engines and that style carries over to my personal vehicle. Rugged looking with style.
1,"Not as described, bad image.",This is not the diamond plate tread pattern. Image not clear. Plate has round over bumps on it. I would not suggest this plate.
3,Don't buy this IF you also buy his DVD because it is included with DVD,I made the mistake of buying both so had to return. Just thought somebody needed to point out that the DVD includes the companion drill book.
1,Not what i was looking for,I thought this would be a book about drills for the Pose Method. It was a 23 page pamphlet summary of a video I didn't have. It wasn't clear in the description what it was. It was a waste of $10.
3,Why it is not included with the DVD?,When I bought this booklet the only thing that came to my mind was - rip off! While the content is okay this booklet should integral part of Dr Romanov's DVD. Selling this booklet could be compared to charging for a sugar that should come free of charge with a cup of coffee.
5,Much needed companion,"I did not intially buy this, as I read reviews here stating that it came with the DVD. I bought the DVD new, and had it didn't have one.. so I ordered it. Very helpful in going along with the video."
2,An Outdated Reprint,"The contents of this book were published in 1978, then copyrighted and reprinted by University Press of the Pacific in 2001, without update.In at least the case of Wicca, the material is badly out of date and incomplete.[...] During the 1980s, Selena Fox of Circle Sanctuary assisted the Pentagon in rewriting the Wicca section, and it is that revision which has circulated among Pagans. This book is not -- repeat, NOT -- the chaplain's manual in which that revision appears.For a reprint discarded Army instructions, it was extrememly overpriced."
3,Most Unusual Read That I have Purchased for the Chaplaincy.,"Even after earning a Bachelor's in Theology & a Master's in Divinity in theological seminary, pastors and ministers generally learn just about everything there is regarding religion. However, after I purchased this book and began to read it, I was most definitely and utterly surprised to say the least. No, it's not the first time I've read about Wicca, Satanism and the like regarding religion, but for it to be located in of all books a chaplain's text, is a little unusualy for the taking. This would actually be the first book I rated three stars. I suppose it's even lucky to get that.If you're interested in unusual topics in an otherwise general chaplaincy book, then this book is for you, otherwise, I really wouldn't bother with it. Sorry everybody for the bad review, but this is truthful.Joseph Freas, C.C., IFCC"
3,Passenger side mat is too small.,"You would think they'd send you the same size mat for both sides...WRONG!! You get a nice, full size mat for the driver, and a small skinny mat for the passenger. I mean these mats are nice, exactly what I wanted if they were the same size. If you can just buy yourself the drivers side and do something else about the other side."
