3,"Excellent fit, reasonable audio quality - but poor build quality on ear-thingy",The headset's sound quality is reasonable and the price point is good. The headset connects quickly with my phone. What really sold me on it was the fit & lightness. The flexible over-the-ear arm is beautiful and makes for the most comfortable fit.However - this flexible arm is also its weak spot. I have bought (& broken :( ) three (yes THREE) of these. The flexible arm keeps snapping off after a few months of continuous usage. I finally learnt my lesson and decided this was a design flaw - not planning to buy any more of this model.
4,Good headset,The headset works very good and i use it for my PS3 but the problem is it tends to pick up background noises and my ear starts to hurt after a while of having it on.
4,good item,Came expeditiously with easy to follow directions for bluetooth setup. not as comfortable as my previous jabra but it definitely reduces outside sound and interference. overall good item for the money.
3,"Nicely built, but too loud.","This S-30 Tom Stellar Air Pump operated quite nicely, and appeared to be doing it's job rather well. However, this thing is loud! Sounds like a compressor, which of course, it is.I went with the S-20 model, and it's like night and day in the noise department. Same build quality as the S-30 with rubber feet and all.FYI, apparently, these are an all black model now, not like the current picture on Amazon. They have the STELLAR name vertically printed on the top of the housing in large letters."
1,if you want period instruments get Trevor Pinnock's CD,"These were some of the earliest authentic instrument performances, back when musicians didn't have a good grasp of period instruments and good soloists interested in period practice were almost non-existent. Now we have some outstanding musicians making period instrument recordings with experience playing Baroque instruments. So for a good period instrument recording, I would recommend Trevor Pinnock and the English Concert Orchestra or other good period ensembles. Don't settle for Gustav Leonhardt. He was a pioneer, but he wasn't a good conductor. And the same for the orchestra in this recording."
2,Good story but Difficult to read,"The story in this book is clever and humorous but the author's attempt to write in a sort of Elizabethan English akin to Shakespeare is a clumsily annoying contrivance that makes it unnecessarily hard to decipher. This forced archaic manner of speech the author used for the characters severely detracts from the enjoyment of what is a good plot. One gets the sense that the author is torn between making the characters speak as though they were from a Grimm fairy tale one minute and then like they are a bad stereotype of a hillbilly the next. I had an easier time reading James Joyce's ""Ulysses""."
3,Goose Chase,If you are in for a adventure fanasty you have chosen the right book. I rate this book 3 stars because I do not the genre of the book. Patrice Kindl is an amazing author and does a great job of making cliff hangers. Once you start this book you will never want to put it down! Goose Chase is an Awesome book and I promise you that you will enjoy it.
4,Goose Chase was a pleasant surprise.,"Since I work in a high school library, I try to read as many selections as possible of those that sound like something I'd like to spend an evening (or several) with. Many teenagers tend to shy away from something as juvenile-sounding as a fairly tale. However, Goose Chase was cleverly written with a great deal of tongue-in-cheek sense of humor, and the ending was a surprise, at least to me. All in all, it was a delightful and thoroughly enjoyable read. I'm now looking for other offerings from Ms. Kindl to add to our shelves.Deana Carmack, author of The Dragon Outside and Futures"
4,"Very amusing, of the same quality as Woman in the Wall.","I loved this book. Although very different from The Woman in the Wall, it was just as excellent. The characters were great, although it did seem a little too convenient at times, how everything always went just the way it should to break the enchantment. I know, you can shrug it off on the fairy godmother, but I really rather disapprove of that. But otherwise I loved the book. I wish there was a sequel. I love sequels."
5,Adorable,"I loved this book.It works beautifully. The goose girl is perky and resourceful. The Prince, the right mixture of dumb and cute. And the voice, consistently irreverent and funny, never struck a wrong note.A potpourri of fairy tales creates a delightful story."
3,The Caprice of Geese!,"Although not as thought out and meaningful as Shannon Hale's ""The Goose Girl"", it was a very fun read.I found expectation and wit that compelled me to finish this book. A little gem, but not a classic.Jenny L. Bates, author ""Opening Doors: An equilog of poetry about Donkeys"""
3,Person-Centered Therapy,"I read this book as a requirement for a pyschology course that I'm taking. At the time I read the book, I thought it was a bit dry, but there were definitely touching stories and concepts that I really remember. Carl Rogers was quite the visionary, especially in the conservative 1950s. I recently saw a video of Carl Rogers working with a client using all the concepts he spoke about in his book. I don't know if the movie was more effective because I had already read the book, or if the book now held more meaning because I saw the movie. Either way, for anyone interested in really learning how just to ""be"" with people in a heart-centered way, try looking past the academia in this book because Rogers does gift us with some priceless gems."
4,Hollywood of the Fifties,"What is the most interesting thing about this video is how fake all the celebraties, besides Judy were. No wonder she didn't get her academy award, given the obvious jealousy that surrounded her."
3,Only for those who adore Ms. Garland,"Truly, this tape is only for those who worship Ms. Garland, as the first segment is of the Hollywood Premiere of ""A Star Is Born"" and shows Hollywood stars stopping at the microphone, giving a few comments and exiting into the theatre for the film. It becomes tiring very soon, as you realize without a script some of these people were not the best at spontaneous dialogue! The second half of the tape is of segments from her TV variety show, wherein Ken Murray who was known for his ""Hollywood Home Movies"", shows film clips and talks about what is taking place as the clips run. Some of them are of Ms. Garland when she was quite young and she obviously enjoys the segments as you can hear her laughing uncontrollably as she's watching them. Purely for Garland addicts."
2,Only for the hardcore fan...,"The prior customer comments pretty much sums it up. Garland was known to be quite witty, or could be when she felt comfortable enough. Clearly, she wasn't up to it when forced to endure Ken Murray's rather self-serving ""Hollywood Home Movies.""And that long, boring ""Star is Born"" premiere! Please! Very little is revealed here, except that Greer Garson comes across as a self-aggrandizing boor when she gets her turn at the podium."
1,Marxist drivel,"Pure communist propaganda. Movie jacket says hilarious and charming...not one thing in this movie was funny. Pathetic attack on capitalism, starring the daughter of Gerard Depardieu. The same Depardieu who now wants to leave France because they are coming after his money. Ironic!"
5,A terrific movie for its artistic qualities,"A terrific movie for its artistic qualities. In addition, it is also a great depicton of child developmental issues.Highly recommended."
3,so so,"This was fun to read for the most part. There really is nothing new and I do take issue with the claim that this is"" the first major illustrated work"" on Custer. Lawrence Frost's book, The Custe Album, holds that distinction"
5,Fair and balanced...,"As a researcher of youth political participation I'm constantly on the look out for new and exciting reads. While this book is not so ""scholarly"" it is an excellent book. It makes some amazing points and is one of the best books I've read on youth participation. It's easy to read and is not geared towards researchers necessarily, which gives me hope that perhaps it will be read by someone other than scholars. It paints an accurate, yet depressing picture of political participation in America and offers very doable solutions to the problem. Jane Eisner has really done her homework on this one and compiled a book that can really make a difference. Bravo!"
1,Great if you're expecting 1998 technology,"This game was released in 2007, but it's really poor for what it should be able to do.The realistic points - less accuracy while standing, more while prone - are nice but can't make up for the ludicrous shortcomings.Graphics are lackluster at best. Continuity is nonexistent. IGI and IGI 2 are far better than MS3 when it comes to physics and realism.For some reason, it takes two, sometimes three shots to kill (even in the head) and even after two shots the target sometimes doesn't figure out that he has indeed been shot. Delta Force: Black Hawk Down's AI is light years ahead of MS3.The game runs out of fun quickly. I can clearly see why it was in the $4.99 bin. I'd recommend about a dozen older games ahead of this one - the development team really fell disappointingly short with this release."
4,MARINE SHARPSHOOTER III,NOT BAD! TOO EASY TO PLAY! MAKING SHOTS WERE TOO EASY.NOT LIKE THE REAL THING.NOT RECOMMEND TO MY FREINDS.
2,Hinges will break instantly,"I bought 16 of these since I knew they'd be weak and I'd need spare parts.The hinges will break instantly and you'll have to replace them. I suggest labrets or brads with solder. I really do mean instantly. The very first time you bend your finger, the hinges will pop. Be prepared.The tips are too sharp to get into most clubs so you'll need to dremel the tips.Pewter is so weak that a few scritches will bend the finger tip grips out so you'll have to bend them back. Doing this more than a few times will break the tip along the line of the beautiful pattern.For a $4 each costume piece (what I paid), they are fine for a little while. I feel very sorry for anyone who paid $30 for just one of these.I receive lots of complements on their beauty."
4,Awesome! 1 fault.,I have been wanting a piece of finger armor for quite a while. I finally scrounged up some dough and bought this item. The transaction was smooth and it arrived within the expected time. I opened it and was impressed. Only after wearing it for a couple hours did I notice that the hinges dig pretty well into your finger. It isn't a deal breaker and a dremmeled them down to be less of a burden. It was the only fault I could find with this product. I wear it all the time!
3,It's okay,"Got the ring and the first thing I noticed is that it barely bends with your finger. Then one of the hinges broke off after 10 minutes of use.Looks really cool, but the build quality is pretty bad. If you buy it, be prepared to make your own hinges pretty soon after you put it on."
2,incorrect item,DETAILED PATTERN Design Silver Tone Pewter FINGER Ring SPIKEFast service but the wrong item was shipped.
1,Siezed by customs!! Illegal import,Do not purchase! I never received item - but did receive a letter from Australian Customs to say it is an illegal item for import and has therefore been seized! Not happy Amazon!
3,Lacks Fullness ...,"There are some beautiful musical pieces here. However, the emphasis on piano alone makes this album rather one dimensional. Not great for meditation or use as sacred background music. Sadly, it lacks the fullness that good sacred music deserves."
4,Lippincott's Illustrated Reviews: Pharmacology,"An excellent quick review. This book is stream lined, easy to comprehend and fairly good with the number of drugs covered. It should be coupled with a more comprehensive text. I would have had a much more difficult time with my Pharmacology class without it. There is not enough chemistry, but then again it is a review. Overall - well worth adding to your library."
4,a very punctual description of the most important drugs,it was a very good book although there are too many things that are missing. but it's good if you have to look after a drug very quickly. the drugs description is very punctual and with a brief phrase of what they do. I really like it. and the delivery was very quick. thank you for all.Andrea (Argentina)
4,"Good book, simple view of pharmacology","Lots of diagrams, aids in understanding the pharmacological implications of physiological pathways, a must have for any med student"
4,A Fair Assessment,"It is many years since I read Darwin Retried, but I remember it as a thoughtful and careful book. MacBeth isn't trying to score big points, he is simply evaluating the Neo-Darwinian theories and pointing out some weak spots.The main critique I've seen of the book (in other places) is that the author has no alternative explanation for the evolution of life. This is an odd attitude. You can't say that someone is wrong unless you have another explanation for the phenomena at hand? Why ever not?I'd recommend the book because it is not strident, it is not part of any religious or political movement and it discusses some interesting problems with the ""synthesis."" On the other hand...it is pretty old...so some of the material is way out of date."
3,HOW IT ALL BEGAN,"I didn't even know this CD was going to be sold until a few weeks before the release date. This album combines their first two CDs. I bought it expecting to find the same kind of brutal madness as in the other albums, but I was wrong. As I said, this is where it all began so the songs aren't as fast and precise as the newer releases. Besides that, it was really cool to listen to it because I love hearing first compositions. It may not please people who adore FAST FORWARD and UNDER THE BLADE but it's a satisfying CD with its 17 tracks."
5,Peaceful,Chrisotpher's piano playing is very peaceful and calming. Always enjoy his music and have never been dissapointed. You can tell his music comes from the soul of a gentle person.
5,Montana Behind the Scenes,What a great book to take on your first trip through Montana or to re-vist Montana seeing new places. Can't wait to stop in several of the locations the Johanek's wrote about on my next visit to Montana. Easy reading and maps will help you as you travel around the state...keep this one in the front seat with you. I highly recommend this book to those of you exploring Montana.
4,Brought back memories,"My ""Detroit Experience"" was from the 1950's through the 1970's when my grandparents lived there. We visited quite often. This did bring back memories for me, but I got the book specifically for my 87 year old Mother who grew up there. I would have liked to see more of the neighborhoods and more of places like Belle Isle, but it is a good book and I believe she will enjoy it."
2,Not that good,.Not her best. Which is still better than most. I would have liked to see more depth to the story.
5,Humbling Experience,"This is not the only DVD set that I would get on Apollo 11, but I believe it is an important one to have. I'm only 27 years old and I feel that I was greatly brought up to speed on what happened with the Apollo 11 mission during the summer of 1969.The raw, continous footage shown that was accompanied by the actual air and ground communications was surprisingly satisfying. Surprising, because I wasn't entertained at first. No, instead, this DVD set, without hardly any narration, gave me a greater appreciation for what was experienced and accomplished during Apollo 11's flight. Man, I love it."
3,Would've been great without Cooney's fatal flaw.,"Caroline B. Cooney, Losing Christina: Fire (Scholastic, 1991)The closing book in Cooney's Losing Christina trilogy shows the same strengths and weaknesses as the previous book, Snow; the main annoyance of the author choosing to spend a great deal of time reprising events from previous books in the series is balanced by Cooney's mastery of pace and somewhat interesting (if a bit stock) characters. Certainly worth continuing on if you've read the first two in the series. ***"
3,It's okay...,"It was all right of a book... well, I'd say more exciting than the first two, but some parts still dragged a bit."
2,THE FIRE,I was not too happy with this book. It was not as good as FLIGHT 116 IS DOWN. I look for suspence and thrillers. I could not get in to this book. I have not read the other two books in the trilogy. I don't have anything else to say except I didn't really like this book.
4,Mother Knows Best,"I cannot praise Luna's writing style nor her emotional presentation. However, I do praise her for coming forth with a true picture of her son Andrew. He has amassed himself a fortune off the backs of his students. His arrogance is all pervading. There is little compassion to him, nor to most of his students who carbon-copy themselves after him. Their combined egotism is frightening. His magazine is a slick piece borne of the free sweat of his student editors. But the magazine is a hodge podge of opinions that go nowhere. A foray into mental masturbation. Thank you Luna for presenting the world with material someone can read that could dissuade them from getting involved with Andrew and his Cult. I only wish I knew about all this before I got involved. The good news is that I've been so happy since I left the whole nightmare behind me."
5,courageous,"A courageous, truly enlightening book. Highly recommended. This is one of now three full book length expose's about Cohen, not to mention the websites and discussions online - and this one by his mother no less! Seems to go beyond an isolated case..."
3,Boy oh Boy!,"This book validated why India is not on my list of places to visit. Meanwhile, she does a good job of describing her son's (Andrew Cohen) paltry progression from a self-absorbed spiritual seeker to a petulant, manipulative guru. The problem with this book is that while the subject matter is fascinating the writing is a bit amatuerish and taken directly from the author's journal it reads like one long whine. This is basically a cautionary tale. It's amazing that so many people were willing to jump on this guy's bandwagon. We all think we're above that but when we think about who we've elected to lead us we are duly chastened.I am giving this one more star then originally planned just becuse I feel bad that her son is such a jerk!"
2,A mother's inability to accept her son's independence.,"This book says a lot more about the neurotic nature of the author than about anything else. It is obvious that her son is most interested in her freedom, which she has absolutely no clue about, and little desire to live up to. Instead she finds fault with everyone else and completely misses the fact that the problem is with HERSELF. She is more interested in her son returning to his childhood role as her little baby, than assuming the independent stature that he has naturally grown into. My advice is that she begs Andrew's forgiveness for her disrespect and FULLY embraces the responsibility required to live up to her fullest potential."
1,Just for mainframe,"Just like another book DB2 Answers, it is only for the IBM Mainframe, does not cover UNIX, NT and OS/2 well. Does not cover any topic in substantial details.I am working on the IBM RS6000 and I did not get what I was looking for."
4,Mr. Yevich tells all,"Now that I have your attention -- I must confess I have not yet seen this book. But Richard Yevich has consulted my organization on a complex DB2 system, and I would say that his collaboration on this book should guarantee useful insights.Note that this book will likely be only for an mainframe environment. For Unix or NT, I would go with a book on the DB2 UDB version."
2,Save your money,"I receieved the tool promptly, so no issues there. Based on the other reviews that I read before purchasing, I did expect much much more out of the tool and I'm less than impressed with it's performance. It says that it is supposed to be able to cut up to 1/16"" sheet metal. I can tell you that I had a hard time cutting 24ga sheet metal with it. It binds up frequently, the strip that it cuts out curls inside the tool and hangs up inside and makes it so you have to stop and remove the strip to continue pushing forward. The tool included an extra set of carbon motor brushes....I'm wondering if this is foreshadowing. I had hoped that it would be a tool that I would use regularly with my sheetmetal work, but I can see that it is going to be a dust collector, researved only for very small jobs and super thin metal."
4,electric sheet metal shear,"Tool works fairly well. Mine did not have the instruction book, shims or allen wrench with it. Grizzly was very prompt on getting the book to me when I requested it. I'm still learning how to adjust the tool to get it to cut as it did right out of the box which was superb. Then it got tougher to get it through the metal."
3,Shearer,"Great for the price, haven't put it through any paces as yet ... arrived a bit soiled, scratched and dirtied but told it wasn't reconditioned so decided not to send back ... not looking for pristine tool looks but it looked a bit pre used in appearance ... will see better when I have used it extensively (to come) ... good price, let see."
1,It's junk.,"The design sucks. I was able to adjust it so that it was reasonably sensitive, but then after a lot of use some of the buttons wouldn't work. Turned out that they used a cheap sticker on the back of the acrylic buttons and it was falling apart and shorting the switch curcuit board. I rebuilt all of the switches and they work just ok now, but I'm still looking for a good dance pad. I tried going back to a soft pad, but those that I got were even worse. They had been stored too long and the inside soft conductive paper had wrinkles in it and that caused lots of false switch triggers. More junk... I'm willing to pay, but I can't find a good pad at any price."
5,Fabulous!,"I brought a couple of decks of ""Go Ask"" down to my family's beach house. My parents sat on the beach and enjoyed the cards with my 13 and 16 year old neices. The cards are great means to open conversations, share fun memories and compare how times change.With friends, open a bottle of wine, sit and enjoy! Lots of laughs, giggles and recollections.Bring the cards with you when you travel, go out with girlfriends, or when you're hosting a casual dinner with neighbors. Enjoy!"
5,Great for building family relationships!,"We bought our first deck 4 years ago and have had so much fun pulling it out at family dinners that we bought several more to give as gifts this Christmas. Our family constantly amazes each other with our answers! We learn a lot about each other, and stories that would not have surfaced otherwise come out. Lots of laughter, love and sharing. I highly recommend this purchase! P.S. I also use this for group facilitations to get provocative icebreakers and intro questions."
4,Cannot do without it!,The only complaint I have is that this is large pills and I prefer soft capsules. It still works for me though.
5,Better value than “ascorbic acid” Vitamin C,"1,000 mg several times per day has surpassed my expectations at strengthening my Immune System. Does not induce the side effects of the cheaper Vitamin C supplements, and is worth every penny!"
2,not West African music,"though Lamine Toure is trumpeted as an authentic percussionist from a traditional lineage in West Africa, which he is, that is not what Group Saloum is about. The rest of the members are pretty much Euro-American rock musicians from Boston. As a result, the album is not African music with Euro-American enfused but Euro-American music with some West African drumming enfused.This album lacks any of the groove and rhythm that makes Wolof and Manding music so dominating in Africa. The guitars are painfully electric (do not think Ali Farka, think 80s metal) and have no relationship to traditional African strings/guitar.If this sounds good to you, then buy the album as a Euro-American sound with African elements and not the other way around."
5,We love AskDrCallahan!,"We are just finishing our second year using AskDrCallahan curriculum and we love it. We homeschool our son and originally used Saxon Algebra I. My son got an A for the year, but he HATED algebra. I made the decision to do Algebra I again, using AskDrCallahan Algebra I. He loved it! It made sense to him and he could see how he would be able to use it to solve everyday problems. AskDrCallahan explains how algebra is used in the real world. It is broken down and illustrated step-by-step in clear language. There is no unnecessary information or fluff. We're finishing up with Geometry, and we've already ordered the Algebra II set. My son likes doing his math now, and his ACT scores reflect that!"
1,Buy with caution,"Great information - when it arrives. Like a London bus some weeks you get no copy some you get two. When you ring to complain (which I have 3 times in the last 6 weeks) they have no record of your previous complaints, they blame the US post, they dont reply to requests to speak to a superior, and they wont credit you an extra copy. Basically taking no responsibility. I've had it. I'm discontinuing my subscription. There's so much you can get online why should anyone put up with old technology."
4,A very informative newspaper!,"No mater what other amazonians are saying, i still belive that this is the best newspaper for the money it costs.Maybe it is here is England, but I''m not not sure about you people from the other side of the lake think.I think it's a very good newspaper with lots of informative articles and really good sports pages!Rating:4 stars!"
4,A Wonderful News Resource,The London Guardian Weekly is fabulous. It tells you things that you may not find in the American media. I find the price for the weekly steep but well worth it.
1,Be warned - difficult to cancel,"Despite cancelling my subscription to the Guardian Weekly, I have just been rebilled for another period and am finding it difficult to cancel.I have heard of this problem with other Guardian group subscriptions - my subscription was not through Amazon so it might not be an issue here, but thought I should point it out as it seems to be a known issue."
2,The extreme Leftist Line kills it,"The 'Guardian' on the surface appears to be precisely what a good news magazine should be. It has skilled writers who supply informative reports and analysis. I often have enjoyed its book- reviews.But if one reads for a while one notices just how great the political bias of the Guardian is. It tends to blame the United States for whatever particular problem it is addressing. Its Mideast coverage is appalling. It has years followed a strong anti- Israel line. It in doing this has been especially immoral in regard to Palestinian terror which it finds every excuse for.It simply does not have credibility, and therefore I would suggest seeking international news from a more balanced source."
1,"Incorrect info on product page, poor return policy","The product page specifically says the band for this watch is plastic, but it isn't. It is leather. When I requested to return it, their return policy is EXTREMELY restrictive. The fact that the there is nowhere you can actually view the return prior to ordering seems a bit sly -- I know I would not have ordered the item if I had read it before placing the order. My own fault, though, just in a hurry to get what looked like a cool Xmas present at a great price. I just will make sure to not order from them again."
4,Not the PC but fun,Unreal Tournment for the PS2 would never beat the PC version and I never expected it to. But when I started playing I started to think that this game might at least match the PC version. I was right. This is a fun PS2 game. Using the B control setup it was easy to get into and a lot of fun. The fact that it has auto aim made it a lot better. The control pad is a lot more sloppy then a keyboard and mouse but I didn't miss it. I wish that it had some kind of stats like in the PC version. I have played the PC version for a while and like the PC version I still haven't seen the chainsaw. I don't know if there is one but haveing a little Doom flashback would have been nice. This is a good game that does justice to the PC version. I bought it and am glad that I did.
1,A horrendous game you cannot play!,I have played this game for PC years ago and it was fun and as a matter of fact it was alot better than PS2. Now don't get me wrong I would give this game a much better rating if I can atleast control the characters control movements but this ps2 version is a massive ripoff because you can berely control the characters you don't know which buttons to push to make the characters move or shoot and the option mode was absolutely no help at all.And that's all I know and give this a bad rating review and the graphics and music I don't care too much about that.Please don't waste your money on this piece of junk it's not really worth it.I returned this piece of junk game for an exchange for castlevania lament of innocence instead and that game was fun.Buy that game instead of this game you will love it and thank me for it.Stay away from this game!
2,UT flunks on the PS2,"I bought UT for the PC and played that game to death. When I bought my PS2, since I like FPS, I decided to rent Unreal Tournament for the PS2. Let me say this: whenever PC games move over to consoles, they fail 99% of the time, and this is no exception.The graphics are horrendous for a PS2 game, unlike the PC version, these graphics seem muddy and unclear. The other falling points of this game are the lack of levels and characters, and no on-line play is the final nail in the coffin. Buy Timesplitters or the PC Unreal, save yourself from this turkey."
4,Real Fighting,I love this game because you can basicly run around shooting anything that moves(and somethings that don't). It was my first game and still my best.
2,"Good game, but...","compared to it's PC brethren, this title is sorely lacking.No online play = no fun without multi-tap and 3 extra dual shock 2's...Ugly graphics compared to PC, or even fellow PS2 First Person Shooter: TimeSplitters.Slowdown. Lots of it. Especially in multiplayer. Do not play with more than one other person or you will experience some serious slowdown. It's not so bad that you CANNOT play it, but it is very frustrating considering how powerful PS2 is! You shouldn't have to put up with slowdown with this kind of machine. If you've played Perfect Dark, the slowdown is comparable to that game in 4 player mode.Horrendous controls. The game gives me a migraine every time I play it because for some reason the controls aren't fully customizable...."
4,"PC ""Game of the year"" comes to your Playstation 2",If your a fan of First Person Shooters like I am this is a must have. It has 10 cool weapons to use in over 50 massive levels. It has four cool modes. The best part is multiplayer it is really fun. When I first played this game I loved it.
4,Great game for children!,"I would highly recommend this game for children between the ages of 5-12. You have to solve math problems that aliens give you while going through their complex underground dungeon. It is very educational but received a Mature rating because some of the math problems get very hard towards the end (algebra, etc). Also recommended for younger audiences : Grand Theft Auto III."
5,Wow...,"I played the Quake III arena game online in it's testing phases but haven't played anything like it before or since. Then I saw this game and saw the similarities between the two so I bought it. The games are nearly identical, in play and in design. Unreal's graphics are outstanding, the use of lighting sets the mood for each level and the detail of the weapons fire is really remarkable. Once you fire a shot you can see it's path all the way to the opposite end of the room that you are in. The game play does take some getting used to but you can customize the skill level. This game really deserves it's Mature rating. If you hit your opponent with a rocket, for instance, he explodes into bloody pieces right before your eyes! There is a way to turn this feature off for the faint of heart or for the parents of younger gamers. In my opinion this game is worth the money and gets a ""Worth a Buy!"" from me."
3,Still the best online game..,"When I got this game for my birthday, I wasn't really happy; I had no internetconnection to play the game online. But as soon as I installed the game, I came to the conclusion that this game rocks even offline. The AI is very adjustable, and it just looks like you are playing online. If you buy this product, you will play it forever..."
5,"I laughed, i cried, I killed the bots!","This was the first game i purchased for PS2. And i have to say this was well worth my money. I can recall one capture the flag level were i just sat in the top tower and just sniped every enemy that tried to take my flag. This game is one of the best games i played. I recommend this game to anyone who loves a great shoot 'em up game. Me, I'm the king of Shoot 'em up. Game or Shooting Range."
2,Terrible,"Terrible terrible terrible... very very dissapointed with sony. I actually bought this game for ps2 even tho i had it for the pc. The graphics r terrible, the controls r demented, and it is no fun without playing it with atleast 10 people in the same map with people all over the world, which is a very lacking point of this game.. dont waste your money and time buying this game... get it for the computer... it is cheaper than this one, it's still played, and is a great game... the pc game is a classic, the ps2 one is no more worth a pecan's droppings."
3,Buy the PC version if you have a decent computer,"The PC version is much better.... graphics, control, gameplay, etc...buy this game if you if you don't own a PC, and only a PS2 (though shame on you, cause you have no excuse not to have already purchased a PC... esp. if you were able to afford a PS2.. and not to mention go through the hassle of obtaining one...)regardless... do yourself a favor and purchase the PC version, pay about half the amount of the PS2 version..."
3,Hard to control,"I just bought this game and I think it is extremely hard to control the guy running around and shooting. Maybe I just need to play it more but its pretty hard to control. So if you are one of those people who dont have very good coordination, dont buy this game."
5,shoot to THRILL,"awesome game, can't say enough about it. lots of cool guns and great dialog...variety of arenas is good too. can't go wrong with this one."
2,What was with this?,"For some reason with the sampler, it has no soul and intensity. The orchestra played some of his most energetic songs 'boooooom, boom boom' instead of 'bambam bam boom bam bam bam'. Okay. Ignore that. Johann is an excellent composer. However, this orchestra defeated the"
5,Outstanding!,"A wonderful systematic theology. Very,very detailed. Oden doesn't start with the reformation as true christian living. The sources he is using are like a pyramid. First the scriptures, then apostolic fathers and so on. By this principle ancient and traditional sources are more used than modern authors or theologies.A must for christians of all (!) churches. Buy all 3 volumes!"
5,Great Start,"This is a heavy tome, but I appreciate Oden's discussion about God. He gives many convincing proofs for God's existence which, taken, together, are powerful. He also has chapters about God's nature and God's character. He writes from a mainline evangelical Protestant perspective. He seems to agree with William Lane Craig's Molinism (middle knowledge - God's knows what the world could have been like if He had gone a certain direction, He knows all possible choices and outcomes. Great book."
1,Sux,Hard to read and very difficult to understand. Great for people who have a hard time sleeping. Garrenteed to put you to sleep.
3,Not really that scary,"This book had a very intresting plot.It's about a girl named Natilie and her friends who get into a car accident,then they learned that the person they got in a car wreck with got killed.So basically from there on it's the friends thinking about going to the police not going to the police I could go on for days but basicaly when one of them decides to go to the police they die all the time so it starts to get VERY predictable the ending is the only surprise in the book and that is when everything comes together but I'm sorry not even I will give that out."
3,Too Predictable,I'm sorry but I'm going to have to disagree with al the other people here. I figured out that the girl's boyfriend was killing everyone because he had hit the car and killed the mayors sister about half way through. I think the reason I figured it out was because I have read just about every Fear Street book by R.L. Stine so I kinda know the way he writes. Other then that it was a good book.
3,It was way too predictable.,It's quite pitiful when you can guess the ending of a book after reading the first few chapters. It seems to be like that with most Fear Street books.
3,cool,"it was a very good book,it was very i know what u did last summerish,as alot of people said,but oh well,da book is good,like i said earler,it entertains u enough to keep reading,unlike sum others(The dare any1?)it was unorinagle,and da charcthers were kinda week,and da killer was very stupid and easily guessable,tats my only prob,and da killers death was kinda stupid,but tats all da bad,on wit da good!!!!i relization thing was cool,allthough da ""Twist"" was kinda predictable,it was fun 2 read."
1,Not what I expected...,"Okay, these chocolates are advertised as Boysenberry *Creams.* However, they are more of a too-sweet jelly and not a cream. It didn't taste very good, and it was just weird paired with the chocolate. There are little seeds that are quite annoying, and overall I was disappointed. I love boysenberry and I was hoping for a cream similar to the strawberry and orange creams that Russell Stover makes, but these chocolates didn't deliver. Don't waste your money."
1,This is a Blank Book!,"Don't expect to read about the automat in this book, it's just blank pages of lined paper. Nowhere in the description does it say it's a blank book. I was looking forward to reading about someone ""reminisce about yesteryear"" but my memory of this book is not so fond. I wish I hadn't wasted my money on it."
1,Automat Journal,I was not happy with this because I thought it was a journal about the Automat but instead it was a lined log book and to be written in.
5,Great book,"This was a very good read, I do believe that it is a book that is a mixture of science fiction, horror and mystery all rolled into one. It also addresses the issues of race relations. All in All I enjoyed it."
5,Great Book! I definetly recommend it!,I enjoyed this book from beginning to end. I picked it up from a bargain rack not knowing what to expect and was pleasantly surprised. Great plot! Exciting and interesting!
3,Not Science Fiction,"This book is a good read, but it you are looking for science fiction this is not science fiction. This reads more like a mild horror novel by ""Knuth"" or the authur of ""Pet Semitary""."
1,Worthless,This is more of a promo for tourism than a documentary. I learned nothing. I have amazon prime so I did not have to pay for it. I'd be hoppin' mad if I actually spent money on this thing.
4,Is it just me?,"I just watched this last night,so maybe I need to rewatch,but the package called this a comedy?I found it a romantic drama.But as always ,I love Norma Shearer.I don't understand why she has been forgotten by the public at large?She is one of my favorites of the 30's.I like her better than MGM's other female leads of the era,Joan Crawford,and Garbo!"
2,Not Funny Romantic Comedy,"Relying upon reviews I purchased this movie expecting a ""glossy romantic comedy"". It's pure drama. Painful. I would rate it one star higher as a drama, but billed as a comedy, I do not recommend it. I won't put myself through watching it again. Anybody want my copy?"
1,Doesn't last!,"I bought this for my daughter's computer and it only held a charge the first couple of times she used it then it was back to plugging her computer in. I bought it based on the good reviews here. So, I have to warn everyone that this product does not work for long."
1,"This battery only lasted four months, then died","I bought this battery in June to replace the original battery that had come with my laptop. At first it worked ok, holding a charge of approximately three hours. Unfortunately, this didn't last. After about three months it would only hold a charge of one and a half hours. Sadly, that didn't even last. Now, at four months after purchase, this battery has died - it holds no charge."
2,never charged up,This battery never charged more than 92%. My laptop charge indicator stays yellow. I hold charge less than one hour.
2,Battery will not completely charge,"I tried repeatedly to charge this battery to 100% and it would never get above 40% which was about three hours of usage. When my laptop was unplugged, the usage rate would drop about 1% for every minute used which does not equate to three hours of usage."
4,great battery,I bought this battery for a good price and received it when promised. The battery has a longer battery charge than the original. Thank you.
2,LASTED JUST OVER ONE YEAR,"Purchased this item 08/07/2008. It stopped taking a charge on 09/06/09 or at about 13 months old and just when my son needed it most for college. Yes it worked OK when new, but I expected a longer life. This was purchased from PowerDirect through Amazon.com. I have emailed them 3 times and have so far received no response. Will buy next one from someone else and make sure it is a different brand!!!!"
5,Excellent Purchase,I bought this for my neighbor's 13 yr. old daughter. She is very artistic and she loves it. She is busy practicing her brush strokes.
3,The Sumi-E Book,I purchased this book because I had misplaced my previous copy. It is very informative and one the better Sumi instructional books on the market. Easy to read and follow. I use it when I teach my watercolor students chinese brush stroke psinting and many of them have also purchased the book. I was disappointed in the condition of the second had copy I purchased. It was in worst shape than the supplier led me to beleive. Many pages were not separated and had to be cut apart. Cover was also quite worn. The supplier listed the book in good condition I would have called it fair.
3,Helpful but average,A slightly helpful book on the subject. I found other books to be more detailed and thorough. Save your money and purchase one of the other excellent books on the subject....Might be more applicable to children (13 and under) interested in ink painting.
3,Just ok,"Not bad, but doesn't explain anything about how to mix the ink, how to load the brush or what she means by ""load with grey and then black. Just OK, but I will have to find another book to learn all about how to mix, load, use the brush. Book only focuses on the brushed drawing. If you are a beginner it won't even tell you ""how"" to create the actual stokes, just the direction the brush should go. Keep looking for a more comprehensive book on how to create Sumi drawings."
5,Sumi-e Sense for Beginners,"I highly recommend Yolanda Mayhall's book for those who want to ease into bamboo ink painting for pleasure. I had heard that learning how to paint the ""four gentlemen"" (bamboo, chrysanthemum, plum blossom, and orchid) would give me the strokes I need to do any painting. As a beginner, I didn't fully realize the meaning of this until I discovered Mayhall's book. She has specific, simple instructions on doing the basic strokes. Then she has ""Related Strokes"" sections in her book. There she shows how these simple strokes can be used to paint a variety of subjects from dragons to squirrels to people. My brush is freer and my range of subjects wider sense discovering her book."
1,Very Poor Customer Support,"I have also experienced extremely poor customer support from MAGIX. My retail boxed copy comes up as an e copy. The program requests that I enter a code number to make it a full copy. After 10 phone calls to support [usually there is no one in the office] I have given up on obtaining a registration code. I also attempted to obtain the free upgrade for the mp3 conversion option in the program. Again, no success in getting an activation number. The program itself has some nice features, however, I feel cheated in not being able to get all of the features that I paid for. MAGIX support is the poorest I have ever experienced. Beware of this company."
1,"Good when working, but Crashes Too Much","I bought this after seeing mostly good reviews and because I wanted to convert to WAV format, rather than a proprietary format like WMA. It was fairly easy to figure out the basics, and sometimes I can convert a few albums in a row without it crashing. But it crashes way too often - at least 5 times today trying to convert one album; a full reboot after each crash. After ripping about 10 albums (out of 150 or so), I have decided to give up on this program and look for something else. Too bad . . ."
2,Terrible Customer Support,This software works however this company completely ignores the customer after the sale. The last version I used required unlock codes that you needed to obtain from the company....I never got them despite repeated calls and emails. I cannot believe that they are still in business. Don't buy this software.
1,BUY: If you want to throw your money away,"This is probably the worst data structure book I've read. It was a requirement in class and it was too bad because i had to invest money in much better books. I recommend Illustrated C by Robert Alcook for beginning programmers. I think the only reason my teacher used this book was because he went to school with this guy. Anyways, don't waste your money."
1,Expected better,"I was really disappointed by the purchased item. I expected a regularly printed book and I got something that looked like a photocopied version of the original. Quality if paper is marginal, designs are in black and white instead of the very nice green-blue of the introductory book by the same author.In any case, Amazon's website should reflect the quality of the interior, and clearly state what you buy for your money: $91.20 is way too much for what I got (i.e., not a real book). I really need the book, otherwise I would have returned it."
5,Programming Abstractions in C / review,haven't gone through all the material yet- but have browsed through the book and related syllabus.For starters- this is a book that was [and may still be] used at Stanford. You can even get course videos and handouts etc... from Stanford Engineering Everywhere web site-[...]This book is for the CS106B class- and at a quick glance- it looks like there are a set of libraries that are used [similar to the intro CS106a java class] that provide the amateur student with a framework to make simple gui programs- stuff that looks more intuitive than the traditional intro CS class while delving into some pretty meaty topics.The main reason to get this book is because the corresponding lectures are available online from a respected university along with applicable lecture notes and assignments.
2,Tetris was the only good game...,"All the games can be found elsewhere on teh internet as shareware, and freely downloadable. The cartridge is read only and therefore you can't ""upgrade"" the older versions of the games with newer ones.For the price, I had assumed that the versions of hte programs I was getting were the full blown packages that cna be purchased online. Except for Tetris, I was dissapointed."
2,A decade out of date.,"Card games are easy to program. Graphics needs are minimal, and there is no need to optimize processing speed. Yet there is polish which could and should be added to such software, this is badly lacking from this (and I suspect all Hoyle's) game.The background music is atrocious, usually just three bars repeated on a continuous loop. The dialog from other players is generated pretty much and random, leading to being told 'That was the hand to win' when you just bought a pot full of antes in Poker. Game AI is very simplistic, leading to computer poker players calling when they are bluffing and other stupidities.The games are a decent bit of fun. But this is $5 bargain bin software, not something you should ever pay full price for."
4,Game Lover,We love card games on the computer and this one is fun. The one issue I had as an adult; I don't like the goofy characters they have programed. That's not a real issue just a preference.
5,PDL Journal,"This journal is a wonderful accompaniment to the text by Rick Warren and can be easily used in a book study format or for daily devotions and reflections. It allows one to reflect on the principles in the book in your own words, responding to questions and Scripture verses. The book itself is beautifully bound leather and presents an elegant appearance."
5,LIFE JOURNAL,This journal is a must for a refresher of your thought process while taking the 40 day journery with the Purpose Driven Life book which a wonderful eye opener into the purpose for your life.
5,Great help for Journaling,"This deluxe journal is a wonderful companion book with ""The Purpose Driven Life"". It helps to direct ones thoughts and ideas for journaling. It is a beautiful book and makes a wonderful gift for a man or woman of any age.I highly recommend this book.Dianne Pedersen author of:21st Century Woman of Virtue"
2,"Spiritual-lite, not Spiritual light","Rick's book combines a feel-good touchie-feelie, ""God is my buddy"" with enough good theology to make it almost palatable. He bounces from translation to translation to get the wording that matches his own thought without regard to the Bible's own continuity. In his haste to make his point, he sometimes inverts cause and effect. There are many better books out there. Read this one if you must, but don't expect more than a diet of whipped cream. Keep a sharp pencil to edit, and an alert mind. Don't just ride the wave of nice-sounding spiritual homilies."
1,Post-it Notes are Cheaper,"Come to think of it, Purpose-Driven Post-it notes aren't available yet. Oh well, it'll only be a matter of time before those appear in the never ending flood of Purpose-Driven paraphernalia. If Jesus were to show up today, at Saddleback Church, it wouldn't be hard to imagine him overturning the money changers there."
5,Breath of fresh air,I am two days away from finishing this book and I think it is one of the most inspirational and practical books on how to live a life pleasing to God that I have ever read. It's changed my perspective on the Great Commission and my role in helping to save souls; it has inspired me and shown me how to be a better Christian; it's simply a great book and a great guide - - one I will refer to often. I highly recommend this book to new Christians and seasoned Christians who want a deeper walk with God Almighty - with the I Am That I Am.
1,Wish I had the opportunity to rate it!,Ordered it Jan 9th and still havent received it :(( What the heck???? I dont get it....someone tell me why
1,A lot of money for a blank journal,"<rant>The book is great -- I've got no complaints about that. The *journal* however, confirms my cynical opinion that Christian literature (heck... any ""Christian"" product for that matter) is massively over-hyped and over-marketed.Here's my beef: Every chapter of the journal presents just a single question, then provides a couple of pages for notes. This same question is already at the end of each corresponding chapter of the book. Does anyone really need to drop another ~$10 for that?!</rant>"
3,Why does religion require you to disengage your intellect?,"While not an active church goer, I have a very committed spiritual practice. I read this book on the recommendation of Caleb Booker's blog, where it is given a big thumb's up. The basic premise is sound and the author makes a convincing case.However, he really lost my attention when he made the statement to the effect that, prior to the ""flood"" in which Noah built his boat into which he stuffed squillions of animals ,IT HAD NEVER RAINED - EVER - SINCE LIFE BEGAN(emphasis added), because G*d made water percolate up through the ground to water the plants. Please... G*d gave us a brain and an intellect for us to use. This sort of stuff is as silly as am American pastor who was recently quoted as saying that if the book of Genesis was not literally true, then his christian faith meant nothing and would have to be abandoned. It seems strange to base one's spiritual, or in this case religious, practice on such shaky ground."
2,purposeful review,"not really nbeeded, but couldn't get a clear idea of the sample online, so ordered it."
5,Very good book.,"Very good. Makes you want to travel. Only give few books 5 stars, and this is one of them. Worth the time, give it a try."
2,A Music Fan,"First I must say that Cura is good in some areas but, If you know something about music or singing you will be able to tell that it is somewhat forced at times and the top notes are wavering just a little to much for me to rate 3 stars."
3,A LACKLUSTER PERFORMANCE!,"Jose Cura does have a great voice. But his singing here is too unemotional for my liking and he suffers from pitch problems on his higher notes. (eg. Improvviso from Chenier)Listen and you can tell he just doesn't get quite high enough for his higher notes. he basicly has no quality in his middle voice. His vibratos tend to be very inconsistant the louder he sings. Especially in his upper register. I truely believe that by conducting and singing arias at the same time just don't mix! As far as the next generation of up and coming tenors, give me Heppner, Vargas, Bostridge, and Alagna anytime over Cura. No wonder they booed him at La Scala!"
3,Disappointing after his Puccini CD,"I was favorably impressed with Cura's debut recital of Puccini arias (recorded June 1997), and on the strength of that favorable impression I bought his Verismo arias CD (recorded July 1999) and his Verdi arias CD (recorded Feb. 2000). I found both disappointing; neither is up to the standard of the Puccini disc. What is alarming is that I believe there has been audible deterioration in his voice in the short period of only two and three years between recording the Puccini disc and recording the next two. He is singing heavy roles usually, and advisedly, taken on by tenors later in their careers (e.g., Samson, Otello), and I hope this promising tenor won't sing himself out prematurely."
2,"Histrionics and a ""hard"" throat","I know Jose Cura is an exciting performer -- he has that ineffable and charismatic ""star"" quality on stage -- I've seen it and ""I believe"". But, his vocalizing here suffers from phony (and ubiquitous) vocal sobs, kind of a latter-day Gigli. In addition, his throaty sound wears. It sounds as though he must push a lot of air through to get his vocal apparatus to vibrate appropriately. The result is a hard flat sound lacking surrounding harmonics that provide light and air and frankly, interest. Intonation is too often suspect.A little less ""acting"" and more from-the-heart singing would be welcome."
4,Great for bearing press..,Nice for a bench top press.. The press rod almost looks like it wont hold up under the pressure but it does just fine.. The only thing I would think would make this a better deal would be adding a couple of different size press ends to fit over the rod..
3,Good for the weekend mechanic,"The press did what I needed to do- pressing suspension bushings in and out of suspension arms for a weekend car work project, and for the price, is great. Since this will not be used frequently, the low price price was the reason to buy. There were a few things that I was disappointed about:Steel spacer blocks were in cast form, not machined flat. Makes it difficult to align parts squarely.Only 3 adjustments for table height.Overall, I would recommend for the occasional use, and the press is a good value."
3,Very reflective,"I'll admit it: I bought this watch because it was cute. I loved the color. It is just as cute in person! I love how it looks and feels on my wrist. It is very light weight and easy to put on and take off. The watch is made of a material that definitely holds up over time. It is still as blue today as it was when I purchased it. My only complaint is that the face itself is very reflective. It is sort of difficult to read the numbers on the face when you are out for a run during the day. That is the only thing that I had a hard time with as far as this watch is concerned. Other than that, I love it!"
2,Nike Running Watch,"It is hard to see the screen when in certain light and buttons are hard to push while running. On some occasions I thought I pushed the botton and didn't, missing my stop time or lap time. When the run log is full it gives no warning and instead of erasing the first log in watch it just will completely erases the run time you are currently trying to save. Also had the watch for less than a year and took fairly good care of it but the strape broke off within 8 months. Spend a little more money and get the better watch...."
3,Bob & Tom uncensored,"I ordered the disc because I wanted the uncensored version of Richard Bowden's song - which is GREAT - I was less impressed by the rest of the disc, but still feel it was worth it to get that one cut!"
1,You won't get what you ordered!,I ordered this item and I instead received a watch. I returned the item 2 weeks ago and have yet to receive my refund!!! I am completely dissatisfied with the seller and would never buy from them again!
2,this item was a waste,"This item would not work with my lampbecause the socket was plasticI didn't take the trouble to send it back , but wasted my money"
2,Hard Read!,"I never even finished this book! I have read most of the books about the Laci Peterson case, and this was one I bought before the others, such as Catherine Crier's or Sharon Rocha's, which I must say are the two best books written about the case, especially Sharon Rocha's, which I finished in three days, during my college midterms! Anyway, when I bought this book and started reading it, I got lost and bored with all the author's personal stories, which he somehow tried to relate to the case. I even tried skipping over his personal jarble to get to the actual parts about the Laci Peterson case, but that was hard also, so I just put the book away! In my opinion it would've been an okay book, if the author hadn't included all the personal stories and references about himself. I wouldn't suggest wasting your money on this one!"
1,Pathetic,"The misogynistic and navel-gazing aspects are absolutely valid. But there is more! I cannot imagine a more poorly-written text. I teach college English so I know of what I speak. Poor word choice, horrendous sentence structure, use of informal language, ""magical thinking"" -- something that belongs only in fiction, use of contractions, and more. Who is Knight? He writes like a third grader! How did such a text find a publisher?"
1,Bad writing at its finest,"I tried to read this book, I really did. It is so poorly written I can only compare it to an eighth grader's first draft of a term paper he started the night before it was due. No signs of any editing, wrong word usage, run-on sentences, horrible punctuation, etc. I just found a sentence describing the park they searched for Laci that, without doubt, would be a finalist in any bad writing contest. There's no way this author makes a living by writing. He must have paid to have this published. Unbelievable."
1,DON'T BUY THIS BOOK- ITS RUBBISH,"This book is absolute rubbish. It is not only badly written but it is full of inaccuracies. This man likes nothing better than to write about himself (as if anyone is interested in him for goodness sake)He knows less about this case than I do, and I live in England.If you feel you want this book to add to your library on the Peterson case, then buy it second hand from a jumble sale (or yard sale as you call it in the usa.)Don't line this greedy mans pocket."
1,Les Uns et les Autres (Bolero),I haven't accepted this item yet.Can you kindly check it?Yeh Cheng Chungch2998@ms1.gsn.gov.tw
4,"A Fascinating film, not that old.",Actually this film was produced in 1980 and released at 27 May 1981. I still remember I went to theater twice to see this movie.the music is very good so I bought the original soundtrack cassette too.This film is just a classic.
4,Two for One!,"I remember this movie from my late teens when I loved it. As an adult watching it again I was struck more by the contrast between the two parts - the first World War II part where there is very little dialogue and the story is told in pictures and sound seems far more affecting to me. Then it moves into what can seem like a completely different film - more of a French character film with the focus much more on relationships than events.However, i still love it - not quite sure why, but I just do!"
1,Vivitar DVR-310 is a waste of your money!!!,"I bought this camera, my first video and digital camera, in the hopes of taking wonderful movies of my honeymoon & my new stepson and I feel cheated. I could have taken my money and thrown it out the window. The LCD screen doesn't let enough light in to see when you try to take the picture. And the video camera? Even worse. It's for outdoor use only unless you have florescent lighting in your house. It's impossible to take a good picture. You have to try and line it up 5 times to get it right and by that time you've totally drained the 2 AA batteries that it runs on. I called Vivitar and they wouldn't even hear of refunding me my money despite the fact that I'm so unhappy so if anyone has any idea what I should do with a camera that I don't want, please post it here cause at this point it's a paperweight. Don't waste your money on it like I did."
3,Cheap Fun,"Its not as bad as some of the reviews state. Its easy to use and download in your computer. Ya it eats batteries up!I guess that is what I dislike about it. My suggestion is to wait for a sale, if you can pick it up for under say $80.00 go for it !!"
1,Video quality was very poor,"The video quality on this camera was very poor in normal household lighting. To be fair, I didn't test it in the outdoors, but to be honest what good is a camera you can only use outside? It was simple to operate. I chose this camera because I was familiar with the Vivitar name as a good camera maker. This offering doesn't really come close to living up to standards.The price tag is good, but you're setting yourself up for frustration if you want to try and use this as a camcorder. Don't waste your money. Still pictures might be ok, but the video was just plain sub standard."
1,"If I could, Zero stars!! - DVR 310 is this the worst buy ever???","I bought this cheap and nasty ""thing"" and was utterly speechless to test this out before xmas, and the alkaline batteries (supplied) drained within a minute! (eh?) yes folks - it cannot do what it is upposed to do!. Avoid this at all costs unless you like hassle and losing money, by buying a proper product. Vivitar must be getting hard up. I used to use Vivitar lenses in my SLR (excellent quality) and flashguns (again excellent!). So imagine the suprise in store with this lump of you know what!.Again - Avoid Avoid Avoid, like the black death."
1,Can we give negative stars?,"This hymnal truely sucks. At least use the green hymnal (the Lutheran Book of Worship of LBW). Better yet, the red hymnal. There are about ten hymns in this one worth singing. Advice for a sunday school project : locate the ten hymns that do not suck, tear them out, staple them together, put the stapled part back in the pews, then burn the rest of this worthless drudge. It shouldnt take more than a few hours work for the church ten year olds."
5,still remember the phrases..great book!,"my almost ten year old son and i read this book over and over..i still remember the phrases ""momma's slippers whisper, daddy's bacon sizzles"" and ""sunlight melts like butter on pancakes"" a wonderful book that you can easily picture in your mind...we love this book! also, ""talk talk my crayons talk"" yak yak yackity clack clack clackity!"
2,Not recommended!!,"The cover does not fit the Motorola L6. More annoying than the side button holes not lining up, it also blocks the microphone that you speak into so no one can hear you when this case is on the phone. I would not recommend purchasing this if you have an L6!!"
3,Misleading,"The product is nice and does its job on protecting my phone, but it is misleading that it fits the Motorola L7/L6. As previous reviewers noted, the holes do not line up on the L6."
3,Decent,Not a bad product. I was looking for something to protect my screen and keypad and this defintely does the job. The only complaint is the cheapness of the clip. Mine broke within a week or so. It is best to use the clip lightly.
5,Best of the 3,"Garduation, best of the 3 by far. I thinkit was a little farfetchet though. Thir are still some that are a lot better though. I would recomend Chain leter, Scavenger Hunt, The Hallow Skull, and Fall into Darkness."
4,a real page-turner,"It's a good book. It's a little confusing at times, but you'll get it after awhile. You especially need to read it if you've read Final Friends # 1 and 2, cause it finishes off the series."
5,Elastic Shoe Laces,"What a Godsend! With arthritic fingers, and spinal stenosis, leaning over and tying, and retying laces was such a painful task. Now they stay tied and can stretch to allow my foot into shoes. Saves time and backaches! Nor do I feel like a fumbling idiot!"
2,Works great but look somewhere else,The shoelaces work great but are too expensive as you will only get a single pair. The photo somehow gives the impression that you will be getting more than a pair but not so. The single pair was shipped in a box! It would have been better to ship three pairs in an envelop for the same selling price. Other sellers in Amazon sell these in pairs-of-3 for about the same cost.
3,elastic shoe laces,"The only wrong thing with the shoelaces were that they were far, far to short for the extremely hight price of over 6 bucks. I would never buy from this company again."
4,Met requirements,I was primarily intersted in RPM's. Tester did that. Information supplied with tester is vague. I had to figure out how to use/read the results.
4,Good Quality.,"Seems to be good quality - but haven't really had the time to work with it yet. I'm most eager for the tachometer options - so we'll see. But it seems to be well made except for the temperature probe - seems a little ""crafty"" or home-made."
5,Humpback,One of the best gifts Santa brought to my Grandaughter . She saw Humpback whales this summer and Santa remembered how she was in awe of them.
4,Great Intro to animation,"This is not so much a book on drawing as it is an introduction to the process of traditional animation. Written in a conversational style with plenty of illustrations, it contains amusing anecdotes and tidbits of wisdom from master animator and director Don Bluth. The model sheets and sketches have rarely been seen anywhere else, and the drawings as always are pure genius. I would recommend this book for anyone new to animation or Don Bluth Fans."
4,It's a good collector's item,"If you're looking for a how to draw book, this isn't the book for you. However, if you're a Don Bluth fan, and an aspiring animator this is a terrific book. This book is full of inspirational anecdotes, stories, and tips, than practical working knowledge. I'd recommend you get that the Preston Blair Animation book if you're looking to learn all that. However, I will say that Bluth goes deeper in to concepts of ""timing"" and ""beats"" and the art of story telling than Blair does (actually, Blair lacks the story telling chapters.)This book also goes a bit in to story-boarding. Which for fans of Dragon's Lair makes this a really neat book, since it contains storyboards from an entire scene of the unmade DRAGON'S LAIR movie. I really wish it would get made someday. :(All in all, it's a good book, a bit underwhelming (even as a fan, I can understand why it would sell for $5 and under here on Amazon), but a good purchase none the less."
5,fantastic book for animator,"This beautiful book is indispensable for those who want to approach theworld of animation, this book is the history of animation. Not onlyDisney but a group of animators that created a new world animatedi have all books of Don Bluth.These books are the official guide for NEMO Academy."
3,An understanding of how animation is made,"It has decent information. It goes over all the techniques that animators have used, including the authors own. This would be a book for a person who's beginning in animation."
5,Bob's review,"The book is a great introduction to a variety of meditation techniques. And althoughI read the book many years ago, I still benefitted a lot from my recent purchase andrereading it."
3,Interesting information but not a good fit for me,"First, any potential buyer should be aware that the second half is a listing of groups and retreat locations. To me, that sort of material is better found online, since it is only using the info provided by the groups (rather than being an author review).The first half of the book gave me some good ""aha"" moments when it helped to explain the different types of meditation as well as how movement and yoga can be integrated. I really found it worthwhile to read. That said, it did not have the warmth and humor (and humanness, perhaps?) of some of the others I have read. At times, I felt that the author was providing a guide way beyond my present goals -- sort of like describing how to compete in Olympic swimming to someone who is just learning how to swim."
5,Had to have it again,I owned this book a number of years ago and loved it. I moved and gave it to a friend who was starting a meditation practice. He loved it as well.I had to have it again. Not only is it a good beginners guide to meditation it is full of wonderful quotes!
1,Author's Homework,"Anticipated a fine read but was soon broken hearted with what I call his homework. Somewhere around 30 or more pages of credits etc., mind you the book is only 130 pages? The book gives new meaning to the phrase, ""what a waste of money""."
4,Pillow cases.,"These are great for ever day use, I put designs on them to brighten them up, they do need some ironing."
4,Great points about the links between mental health and eating.,"I enjoyed the book. It was written in a very personal style, and she made some great points about the connection between mental health and eating. The only issue I had was that by the end I felt like the author was repeating herself a bit."
2,Proceed With Extreme Caution,"There is evidence that bingeing disorders can be caused by the taking of antidepressant medications (Seratonin Re-uptake Inhibitors, like Effexor, Prozac, etc.), because of the metabolic and neurological derangement these chemicals can produce. The effect can last for years after the client stops taking the drug. For people in this situation, psychological remedies of any kind are ineffective, and Roth's ""eat what you want"" method can be downright dangerous. If you have been prescribed antidepressant medication, and your compulsive eating began AFTER you began taking it, consider that this might be the cause. Proceed into theories like Roth's with extreme caution. To her credit, though, this book is a great read. It goes quickly and is full of interesting and often touching anecdotes. Her tone is gentle and compassionate."
1,It's all about Geneen,"I was REALLY disappointed in this book, and I recommend that you not buy it. It was all about her, her romantic relationships, and her friends and aquaintences. This book tought me nothing.For a great book on how to stop compulsive eating, I HIGHLY recommend The Taming Of The Chew by Denise Lamothe."
3,Good - but her other books are better,I enjoyed reading this easy to read book. There was a large focus on abusive family situations - which did not resonate with me...and I think she went a little too much into her personal experiences...But every once and a while I did get some interesting insights into my own behavior.
5,When Food is Love - Fantastic!,"This book is excellent! It is an easy read and really leaves you wanting to seek out her other books that have similar topics to ""When Food is Love"". The book is insightful and it provides practical advice and even anedotes for those seeking to better understand the relationship between food and love. I found the author's work very entertaining. The book continues to build and become even more appealing as you complete one chapter, you cannot wait to get to the next. I never wanted to put it down. :)"
5,perfect fit,"part was a perfect fit and looks like it will be fine, have not assembled the vacuum and tested yet. rotated fins by hand . clearance seems fine. will have to wait to run and see if it holds up."
3,not so definitive,"Considering ""La Casati"" an icon, the new edition renders an appaling idea in terms of images: all are b/w and printed on standard paper.If you are patient, I recommend you to search for: the French edition (still available) and the English one (from which the Quentin Crisp intro has been culled). The Italian edition is also worth tracking down.All in all, a higher price for the inclusion of colour images would have been a better option. Stefano Galli"
5,The Original Goth Girl!,"""'Infinite Variety' is a thoroughly unbiased and well-researched biography. The 'Definitive Edition' includes a plethora of new information as well as artwork and photos. Thanks to the efforts of Ryersson and Yaccarino, the story of the Marchesa Casati, with all its splendor, will continue to astonish.--Jonathan Williams, Gothic Beauty Magazine"
3,Could have been better.....,Very dry book about a fascinating person. A book about the Marchesa Casati could be a lot of things- but the authors chose to make it rather dull and boring. A pity.
1,Doesnt hold a charge,I bought it used and possibly my own mistake. But it doesnt hold a charge for more than 20 minutes. Take my advice and buy new. Then at least you can take it back when it starts to act up.
3,Not what expected,"I might be wrong, but when I read the product description I thought they come in pairs and they didn't. Therefore when I ordered the front and the rear I was expecting to receive the four pieces and I just receive one front and one rear... Total useless if they are not changed in pairs..."

1,doesn't secure the keyboard,"There is not a way to secure the keyboard to the stand. It just rests on top. So if you are at all energetic when you play, the keyboard slides all over the place."
4,"Good, sturdy stand for the money.","I purchased this stand for my Yamaha P85 digital piano. It's very sturdy and well made, only I wish it would have a lower minimum height for my youngest daughter. You should note that some keyboards and digital pianos are not flat on the bottom and won't sit level on this X-stand (or most other X-stands for that matter) - they'll tend to slide around. This problem is easily solved by getting yourself a 4' x 1' x 0.75"" piece of shelf board or similar, priming and spray-painting it black, then place it on the stand. Keyboards with rubber feet will sit nicely on the board and won't slide around."
2,Knee knocker,"Sturdy, but the crossbar gets in the way of knees. A table style stand is a better choice IMO. I wish I had gotten this one: On Stage KS7150 Table Top Keyboard StandOn Stage KS7150 Table Top Keyboard Standinstead."
4,Rock Solid,"This is a rock solid keyboard stand; however, it's adjustments are not fine enough to get it to fit into the factory keyboard stand groves on a Yamaha PSR-E333 (-1 star given how popular Yamaha keyboards aer) which I would assume, based on dimensions, may mean it won't fit other Yamaha keyboards either. That being said, it's so solid that the PSR-E333 sites nicely on top of the rubber bumpers and doesn't move. For the price I doubt you will find a more solid stand out there."
2,not easy to adjust,"It's great if you don't plan to travel with a lot with your keyboard. However, it's very hard to adjust the levels of the stand. I do not recommand this if you are performing or traveling with this stand."
2,Arrived scratched,"The product itself seems fine, but it arrived scratched. Not going to go through the hassle of trying to exchange - shouldn't have to."
4,Will,Listening to this album brings back many many memories from the 70's. This gift just keeps on giving. R.I.P. Janis.
2,Fanastic Four & X-Men,I misunderstood/ miss read. I already have Fantastic Four and all the X-Men DVDs. I thought Fantastic 4 and X-Men were in a movie together.
3,Beginner Violin,The Bow is not very good. The bow uses nylon not horsehair.It is very loose even you tighten it.
2,Listed dimensions are misleading,"The Amazon listing for this keyboard tray gives it's width as 25"", but that could only be true if you were measuring from one edge of the brackets to another with the brackets already installed. The actual interior tray size is slightly less than 21.5"". I bought this because my keyboard is just over 21.5"" long and it doesn't fit in the tray."
2,flimsy brackets,"I would pay more to have a framed bracket and a mouse tray that doesn't force you to remove the mouse when you push the drawer in.The drawer itself is nice, but the overall design is ill-conceived, and has the indications that it wasn't really tested by real users.I don't know what the other guy was thinking... I guess if you never need to push in your drawer or don't need the mouse tray, and are a light user, then I can see how they would rate this high (or they're in a ratings-mill in India lol...)"
3,Bring back the old....,I have ordered the sugarless rock tea for years and now the old familiar green packets have been changed to black packet now called Golden Sun. The taste is different even though they claim it is the same...Bring back the old packets.
4,"Great Content, no 15th disc","All the content is awesome, although the packaging is pretty flimsy. Also, there is no 15th disc as was advertised."
2,Ridiculous pricing,Two stars for pricing. $160? F that. I'd be more willing to pay $100 considering you can pick up to season ten on DVD for almost as much. Retarded
5,Just as described,"I read reviews on this gate prior to purchasing and everything I read was exactly what we got in the product. Easy to install, sturdy and safe, easy to operate. Can't go wrong with this one..."
2,The wood is too flimsy!,"I purchased this gate for the top of our stairs based on the great reviews it received. My husband installed it with little trouble, although he did have to get drywall anchors for the screws as their weren't studs nearby.However, one installed, we could tell the gate just wasn't sturdy enough to really feel comfortable with. The wood rungs are very thin and bendable. Our baby is 10 months old, and while he couldn't do any damage to it now, I'm concerned a wood slat could snap when he gets older (maybe 18 mos).Also, we have a 5 year old who will be using the gate, and I'm not comfortable with the idea of him putting any weight onto this gate as he's using it, I feel it could easily break.We're retuning this item.I think it's a fine gate for other household areas, but I wouldn't trust it for the top of the stairs."
3,"Good item, but can be difficult to install","The gate does what it is supposed to and is very sturdy. However, it is not made for stairwells that have molding on the bottom of the wall."
4,Good Protection overall,"I don't understand how ratings on the same gate can go from 5 stars to 1 from different customers. It's like they are talking about different gates! This gate has no plastic parts. The gate, pictured above, is constructed of solid wood with all metal hardware. I purchased 3 of these gates to protect my son from falls down our various flight of stairs. I even installed one on the top of our stairs to our outside deck. I simply slide the gate off from it's hardward during bad weather and bring it inside. I also bought a 4th gate and installed one at my in-laws. Depending on the location and the presence of a stud, installation can take a little work and create a challenge. The templates and instructions could use some improving. I have been happy with all these gates overall."
4,Great gate-decent price!,"I like this gate a lot. It is easy to open with one hand but is durable. I didn't like having more holes in the walls but an attached gate is recommended for the tops of stairs. I love that it can be removed easily when not needed. (I, too, have a slight vanity issue like one of the previous reviewers.) It also swings all the way open to lay flat against the wall. The price is right for this attractive (relatively), easy to use, and practical gate. I see what others have said about the bottom of the gate being able to slide out when shaken. If this happens, the gate is not properly installed! I know this because my husband installed a second one of these gates and we had that problem. The gate, however, is not installed level. The other gate, that is level, does not have this problem. When properly installed, this is a great gate!"
4,where to get it,"Just a tip - after searching the web, looking for the very best price for this gate (especially since we need four of them!), I called my local Target store to see if they carry them. They do, & lo & behold, they charge $... for them (same as the best price on the web), except that you just have to pay tax, not shipping (which can be $... on line). And, you can pick it up today, rather than waiting for them to ship it to you.Just thought someone would like to know."
3,"Great, if you don't have baseboards","I'm not sure how they expect you to be able to install this gate. The instructions say you can't install it over uneven trim, and the bottom of the gate has to be between two and three inches from the floor. I have two kinds of baseboards in my house--the old clamshell kind and some taller newer trim--and I couldn't install it over either type. I had to remove a chunk of trim from the wall entirely. I didn't really mind because we're replacing the baseboards in that area anyway, but I would guess most people would find this pretty annoying."
2,It's okay,"Sometimes tough to open, wood is sliding on wood and sometimes it sticks, plus can be tough to fit to openings that have high baseboards."
3,If you have molding - KEEP LOOKING,"I found the gate difficult to install. Make sure you measure your molding. If its 2 1/2 inches or higher - I would suggest trying another gate. You will need to add a block of wood tohte wall side, as it cannot adjust to the differences due to the molding. Additionally, the template holes did not match the holes on the fasteners. My six year old is not strong enough to open it, requiring us to open it for her. I finally got it installed at the top of the stair. I had bought two, but now think I will return the second one and keep looking."
4,Gets the Job Done,Installation was fairly easy. Still keeps my son upstairs and he's three. Aesthetically looks good.My only gripe is that sometimes when trying to line it up to close it pulls out of place from the end where its installed. Usually pops back in place easily with two people but can be quirky with one person trying to put it back in.
4,Size not as described,"Description states the gate is 30 inches high, but it is only 27 inches. I made it work anyway and am happy with it, but do wish it was a little taller."
4,good gate-but not at the top of your stairs.,"I like this gate. It is easy to open woth one hand and is very sturdy. I'm not sure if I would use it at the top of my stairs. The bottom tends to pop out. But for the kitchen (no stairs) I don't think it's that big of a deal. I WOULD NOT trust it at the top of my stairs. I like the way it open all the way. It lays flat against the wall. In a high traffic area, that's a great option. It also removes, totally, very easily which I like. just don't trust at the top of your stairs."
5,Easy and Safe,"We have twin toddlers and wanted secure gates for the top and bottom of our staircase. We bought two of these and found them easy to install, relatively attractive, very secure at both top and bottom of the stairs, and convenient to open and close with one hand. They have taken lots of abuse from the kids and are still going strong. I'd recommend these gates to anyone."
2,I Broke it!!!!,We had a difficult time finding a gate for our wide open doorway and was excited about this gate. It took my husband a few hours to get it set up and then I found the latch difficult to maneuver one handed. My 22 pound 1 year old slammed it when open and managed to break the latch. I found this gate very frustrating and would love to replace it!
5,"great looking gate, works wonders!","This was the 3rd gate that we bought & tried at home. Finally we found a gate that works! It has a nice wood finish, so it looks so much better than the plastic or metal ones. Then, my husband actually got it mounted in minutes, which is great , considering that most home projects, take days, if not weeks to finish. Thirdly & most important, it was great for our 2 toddlers! Though it says 'Top of the Stair' i used it for our kitchen. Even with both of them hanging on, they can never bring it down. They cannot figure out how to open it, and best of all, since it has no holes like a lot of other gates do, they cannot climb over it. They have tried their best to hang on & rattle it, but it never comes off! Its so easy to open & close with one hand. When we first brought it home, I was sceptical it was going to last, but it did! I would recommend this for anyone who has active toddlers at home. It looks great, works well & is great Value for Money!"
1,Hate this gate!,"This is probably my 4th gate purchase after searching for the perfect one for the top of my stair and reading the great reviews for this product I bought it. I have a 3yr old, an 18 month old and #3 on the way I wanted a gate that was easy to open/close with one hand while carriying a baby...this was not it. You have to make sure that the top and bottom line up exactly to get it to lock not exactly easy with one hand and then when you have to slide it to open I have already pinched my hand in it multiple times and it had only been up 1 day!!"
5,Best Gate I Ever Bought!!,I have been in the daycare business for over 28 years. I have had several gates. This one is the best one yet!! I use to have a hands free swing gate. This limits the width of the opening. You need to aim in the middle. The Evenflo gate will swing all the way open and give you the entire width of the opening that you are blocking. It is low enough that I just straddle over it or undo the latch.
2,"cheap, but not worth it","Cheaply made of unfinished wood. Seems sturdy enough once it's latched, but just because it's made of wood does not mean it is good quality. It is stapled together (no screws, dowels, or glue), flexes in every direction and binds when you try to slide it open or shut. The quick removal feature means the hardware on the hinge side is also sloppy and rattles. We took it down after 2 days and were happy to spend twice as much on a better gate."
3,"Barrier, yes. Secure?","The gate is easy to install. Looks nice initially and swings open easily. The latch is sometimes difficult to unhook for one with intermittent hand strength. We are using it as a doggy gate. The wood is lightweight and easily damaged. Wish we had bought the metal one with hands-free opener. After a month, this one will be ready for the burn pile soon."
5,"Work so well, I threw the box away and bought another.",This is a very simple and sturdy gate. Very easy to use one handed. We put the second one at the door to our child's room. It's easy to be quiet shutting this gate. I've recommended this gate to my friends already.
4,Good gate - as long as you modify it,"Understated gate, working well enough. However, our tree year olds were breaking the slats on it on daily basis. We finally screwed on a sheet of durable transparent plastic to reinforce the gate. That worked very well - we had no breakage ever since!"
4,Great Gate,This gate is affordable and works well. I bought this for the top of our stairs and I'm going to buy another one for the bottom of our stairs. My 1 year old son likes to climb up other gates but he can't do that with this one. Installation can be a little tricky (especially if the area you are blocking is uneven) but my husband made it work. This is a safe and nice looking gate!
3,"Very solid and safe, but takes a bit to install.","I would rate the gate 5 stars if the kit included hardware for floor trims. Because it does not, it did take me a bit to fashion my own wall reinforcement (thanks to the photos posted by other users). If you are do-it-yourself savvy, then this gate is for you."
2,buyer beware,"I got these gates about 2-3 yrs ago, they worked great in the beginning, but after time (2-3yrs) they seemed to become softer (wood) and more flexible to the kids abuse...my kids pull on the gates some so they are rough (3 and 1 yrs old) but not so rough that these should not hold up...I HAVE 3 of these, and my son 3 yrs old now knows how to open them and let our baby up/down the stairs (he is only 1 so this is very dangerous)...Obviously we are going out to purchase a different kind...Look wise these served their purpose, but quality & craftsmanship, I would think they should last past 3yrs, but they have not, so that is why I say BUYER BEWARE."
2,Built Cheap & Dangerous,"The BabiesRUs store I went to did not have one out of the box to look at, so I went off of what I could tell on the box. Once I got it home, a few things became obvious. First, it would not work with my stairs due to the lack of a stud in the proper place on the wall side. I realize that is not a design flaw in the product and just an incompatibility. However, I also found it to be a poor design. When the gate was open, the two pieces would freely slide in and out from each other. Due to the space between the two pieces, it presented an obvious pinching hazard to little fingers and adult fingers alike."
2,"Have two, one works and one doesn't","We had a baby safety company baby-proof our home, and several safety gates were installed. The Kidco, inc pressure gate works well in our hallway and is easy to open and close. We have two Evenflo Walk-through stair gates. One, at the top of the stairs, works fairly well, but you need to use two hands when opening and closing this gate (which means putting down a crying child momentarily while wrestling with the gate). The one at the bottom of the stairs is useless, since the wood appears to have warped and can not be closed without pulling the entire gate (screws and all) out of the wall. We're in the process of looking for another gate (anything-but-wood)which can be opened easily with one hand. Hope this helps."
2,difficult to maneuver,"I bought this gate because the reviews were good. While it's a sturdy gate, and matches the decor/woodwork in our house, it is very difficult to open and close. You have to slide the gate and lift a lever while you slide it into a slot. Sometimes the top and bottom don't go into their respective slots at the same time. It's really a pain in the butt, especially if you are caring a baby in one arm.I recommend trying a gate that does not slide."
3,"Generally a good choice, but....","In general, this is a good, strong, attractive, well-engineered gate. But...1) The latch does stick a bit, though maybe I didn't mount it perfectly enough?2) There's enough flex to the gate, and the insert for the bottom rail is short enough, that not only has our son been popping out the bottom rail for weeks now, but the day before he turns 2, he has managed to escape the gate.I would guess that a design with top AND bottom latches would work better once once's child is old enough and strong enough.While I expect it will still work as a deterrent for him, and his little friends, if he's not determined to get out, it will no longer stop him if he doesn't want to be stopped."
5,The best gate available!,"After much research and checking out several different types/brands in the stores I chose this one. This is the only gate to have at the top of a staircase, it is very strong and secure. The safety of my crawling son is most important to me and with this gate I have no fear of him falling down the stairs. Not much chance of him opening it anytime soon either as my 6 yr old niece was here the other day and couldn't. Easy to install and easy to remove if for some reason it needs to be out of the way. Looking for a great gate, look no farther this is the one!"
5,WONDERFUL PRODUCT,"I would highly recommend this gate to anyone with little ones. We have ours at the top of the stairs and feel that our child is incredibly safe. It is sturdy, easy to put up, and take off the wall if needed. Even if your child understands the concept of how the gate opens and closes, it takes a little more than strength to actually unlatch it. A MUST-HAVE!!!"
3,eskimosue,"I bought this gate and was really happy with it until my son began to toddle. It is super easy to install and easy to open and close; however, now that my son is able to push on it, I can no longer use it. It pinched his fingers and will probably not bear his full weight (at least I am not willing to find out whether it will at the top of a flight of stairs!). I have to say I am VERY disappointed in this product and am having to replace it already."
5,Extreemly Pleased.,"I am the mother of two babies age two and one. They both climb. I have a tension gate with the wonderful holes that they can stick their toes in and climb over and that leaves those wonderful marks on the drywall or doorframe. Since the older of the babies has learned to turn knobs, we found it neccesary to purchase an additional gate for the top of our stairs to the basement. I needed to be able to go up and down easily and not have the babies able to climb it. I purchased this gate, and in 20-30 minutes I had it up and useable. It has been in place for 8 months and they still can't open it or climb it, and I am able to take laundry up without having to set it down to opperate the locking mechanism. We have decided to purchase an additional gate to replace our tension gate in the bedroom. From our most recent experience with this model, we will purchase an identical gate. We have been extreemly pleased."
2,Great at first,"I reviewed lots of gates before I bought this one, and it seemed to be the highest quality for the price. I like the fact that it's made of wood which matches our baby's room decor (the gate is on her doorway, as the stairs are right outside), and the vertical slats are great as she's a climber. It was also very easy to install, now that the correct template is included. HOWEVER, the first time my daughter tried to rattle the gate around the bottom rail slid right out of the wall support, and with a little pulling on her part there was a lot of room between the last slat and the door frame. We've had to anchor the rail with a spring clamp -- very annoying. I can't find the receipt or I'd bring the thing back, and I'd never buy another one."
5,Make sure you install it correctly,"I just got 2 of these (top and bottom of the stairs) and think they are great. The most common complaint other reviewers have is that the bottom pops out. I think I know why:There are rectangular steel boxes for the top and the bottom latch ends of the gate. The box for the bottom is deeper than the one for the top. If you install the shallow box on the bottom and the deep box on the top, then the bottom of the gate will pop out easily. When the boxes are correct, the bottom is held securely."
4,Wonderful & EASY to use!!,"We first bought one of these gates when we moved into our house ... strictly to keep the pets from upstairs. It is wonderful!! Now that we are expecting, we're registering for another to go at the top of the stairs.The only down-fall ... Husbands (or whomever installs the gate) NEED TO READ THE INSTRUCTIONS!! My dear hubby did not read the instructions (that's when I realized just how much like my father he really is) and installed it on the base board. Instead of taking it down and moving it a few inches, he left it as is and rigged some blocks of wood to secure the other side."
1,13 month old broke this gate TWICE!!,"We recently moved into a new house and bought and installed 3 of these gates. Within one week, our 13 month old broke two of the gates. Once by holding onto the rungs and shaking the gate the other time by grabbing one of the rungs when he tripped.Both times the rung popped right out breaking at the top and bottom. This left a gap in the rungs wide enough for our son to stick his head through which means he could get past the gate if we kept it up (which of course we didn't.)"
5,I love this gate!,"I love this gate! I have nothing bad to say about it. We installed it at the top of the stairs. It can be easily taken on and off the hinges, so its nice to not have the gate up when you don't need it. And you can fix it so that it swings open like a door in one direction. The latch is easy enough for adults, but still hard for my 3 year old daughter to open, which is nice so that she doesn't open it and forget to shut it back. She's stuck at the top of the stairs right along with the baby! This was a good investment for the safety of my baby."
5,safe and sound,"We are very happy with this gate! We have had one at the top and one at the bottom of our stairs for 5 years and over three moves. They are sturdy, easy to install (and remove) and keep our children safe. The gates have remained securely in place in spite of children climbing on them and a large German Shepherd dog doing her best to get around them."
5,Awesome Gate,We bought two of these gates when we were expecting our son. Not only does it keep him in place - But Also it keeps our dogs out of the room as well. Our son is over 2 and we are expecting our second - so they are very durable. They were easy to install and very sturdy as well. I like how they open in our out. Also - they can pop out of the bracket if you need to move the gate. Very convenient.
2,This gate was no match for my soon to be 2 yr. old!,"For the price of this gate I expected much more quality wise. My husband put the gate up at the top of the stairs on our landing, and followed the directions to a T. Well whenever we would be upstairs my daughter would stand on the gate and shake it with all of her might, and of course being the stubborn 19 months she is, I could not get her to stop doing this. Well after two weeks of doing this the part of the gate that attaches to the wall (the part that swings) ripped out of the wall. How a 2 yr old could do this I am not sure. My husband put it up again with larger anchors and screws but it looks like it is going to come out again.For $35 I expect much more."
2,My original was great - this one is HORRIBLE.,"I originally bought one of these from a catalog and LOVED it. It was sturdy, durable and perfect for my needs. I bought another at the store and attempted to assemble it tonight and IT WAS TERRIBLE!!! The gate will be promptly returned to the store tomorrow.I'm not even sure what the problem is. The only difference is the brand. It is in all other ways, pieces, and so forth identical to the original that I love. If this is how they are making this gate now, I'm going to have to find something else."
1,Jams more than it opens!,We've been really disappointed in this gate. It sure looks good with the wood railing banister but only works 20% of the time. We spend the other 80% of the time cursing it because it jams or locks-up. You have to keep hitting the remote button to get it to open. Most of the time the top latch opens but not the bottom. We even ordered a new receiver from the company to see if that was the problem. It's such a hassel trying to get up the stairs with your hands full only to find out the gate jammed again. I'm more than ready to replace it!
2,Make a better choice than this...,"It was annoying picking this whole gate up and replacing it everytime we wanted to get into and out our kitchen. We were willing to put up with this until one of our chihuahuas learned how to jump over the gate while we were at work, thereby tearing up some of our living room furniture. Save yourself a headache and buy the Summer Infant Extra Tall Gate..."
3,Sometimes difficult to open.,"We bought this gate for the top of our stairway in a high-traffic area. We had used the extra-wide gate in our former house in an area where we would open it about six times a day and it worked fine. But this gate, which is used much more often, warped and became very difficult to slide open. We replaced it with another one just like it, and it seems to be opening OK so far.Due to the hardware on the bottom of the gate and the molding around the bottom of the post where it was being mounted, the gate is mounted too high. The manufacturer should redesign the hardware on the bottom.The squeeze-type fastener is very difficult to open for those with carpal tunnel. Also, if it doesn't click into place, it could become a pinching hazard for children.For mounting gates at stairways, I would look at all metal options first."
4,"Yeah, an affordable gate for stairs!","I was very excited to find this gate. We have many stairs in our home and pressure mounted gates are not safe for the top of stairs. This gate was easy to install and easy to use. It can swing both ways, or only one way if you like. The gate is 31"" high, which was too high for the stairway we initially bought it for. The banister was in the way. However, we were able to use it on another set of stairs."
5,Our FAVORITE!! We have 3 of them!!,"This gate is awesome! We have three of them and I (female) have installed them all myself with ease! It probably took me 15 minutes the first time and 10 minutes with the additional two we bought. And, the hardware is metal which is a huge plus! We had purchased a very pricey gate that had plastic hardware, and after replacing it three times I gave up and purchased this one. It comes with a template and it's simple to install - step by step instructions. As long as you line the gate up correctly (which is explained in the instructions) it opens and closes quickly and easily for adults, however my three children, the oldest of which is almost six, can't figure it out! And that's saying something because my three year old boy has figured out every contraption out there! We love it and I recommend it to everyone! Even when I'm in the store shopping and see people looking at gates I recommend it to them. Buy it! You'll LOVE it!!"
4,Recommended!,"I purchased two of these gates, one for the top of the stairs and another for the bottom of the stairs. It is simple for an adult to use, but tricky enough that a toddler can not open it independently. Unlike other swing gates, this gate does not have any parts that run along the floor. I have heard complaints of adults and children tripping over the ""threshold"" of some other gates, so I think this is a better design. Another nice feature is that this gate is made out of wood. My favorite feature is the price! I only paid about $35, while many similar gates sell for $100. I cannot give this product 5 stars, because it is a little difficult to install properly. You must be precise or the latch will not line up. Once you have it in place, it is a wonderful gate!"
5,Best Quality & Priced Well,"I tried 3 other types of children gates (I needed mine for the top of the stairs) and thank goodness for this gate. It truely is sturdy. So easy to install (template included with instructions) and the ease of use makes our life so much sweeter. Now when other children come over to our home, we don't have to constantly worry that everyone is putting the gate up properly."
4,Excellent Sturdy Gate,"My daughter shakes the heck out this thing but it doesn't budge. If we had one of those ""squeeze into place"" gates it would have never made it. Installation was easy as long as you're comfortable drilling holes in your wall and/or newell post."
5,best child care gate,"This is the only gate i found that can be removed when not needed. yes, your going to say pressure gates can be removed but they are not safe for the top of stairs. also the instalation was easy to understand and not complcated to install. it is a very stable gate and I love it and recommend it highly"
5,Jam-packed,"""Information nuggets... fill the pages of newest of the Alive Guide series. Authors Permenter & Bigley know their stuff. The book is jam-packed with traveltips that include illustrated dive and snorkel sites, town and regional maps, happy hour beach bars and nightclub options.... Cayman Brac and Little Caymanget plenty of ink as well. Tuck this in your carry-on, alongside a snorkel, mask and sunscreen."" Travel Weekly"
1,Eeek - don't waste your money,"This book did not help us at all - I settled down for a good read on the airplane and was pretty disappointed. I actaully thought what I think about many travel books I buy - ""this is a joke"" - Maybe I just don't know how to absorb information from tavel books.... not sure, but I do not recommend it."
2,Expected more....,"We did not find much in-depth information in this guide. I am used to Rough Guide books which give more ""off the beaten path"" type of information. Most of the information found in this book was available in the hotel lobby brochures. We were left hungry for more information....."
1,A Tony Banks fan for 27 years and I hate this record,"Tony Banks can be brilliant and has been, but not here. Lackluster, no beats and you can't not dance to it, if you know what I mean. I am a total Genesis fanatic and have been since I was 16 - I have seen them live, talked to them in person, been in a band that did it's darndest to emulate their sound and their spirit (and yes, we had a Mellotron, and it sounded fantatsic, when it worked) but when Tony is bad, he's REALLY bad. His best solo effort by far is ""A Curious Feeling"". This is as much of a yawner as Mike Rutherford's 'Acting Very Strange"". Face it, Genesis was a brilliant sum of it's parts.. not all of the parts function nearly as well seperately, with the main exception being Peter Gabirel, who has managed to maintain his artistic integrity through the years (but where the heck is a new album, Peter?)"
2,Just ok.,"I must concur. ""Soundtracks"" and Still are Tony's weakest efforts. Especially from someone who produced perhaps the finest progressive album ever, A Curious Feeling. (Come to think of it, I guess In The Court Of The Crimson King is the finest, so A Curious Feeling would be #2).If you're interested in Tony Banks or just want to hear the kind of music they don't make any more (long, interesting, quality tracks) get A Curious Feeling and then Strictly, Inc. If you're hooked, go for The Fugitive, too.If you're still listening to A Trick of The Tail, Duke, etc, than anything from Tony Banks should sound great. OTOH, if your idea of great music is Invisible Touch or In The Air Tonight, none of this is for you. (Mr. Methane's version of In The Air Tonight, is, I admit, superb).And if you want to hear Mr. Banks work real magic with a soundtrack, hunt down the LP from The Wicked Lady."
3,hard going,"It is an interesting book, but I found it hardslogging through it. It may be Dr. Nettleman'sstyle as I had a hard time with his other bookabout being GOOD. He is a philosopher and Ilike a lot of ideas, but like I said hard sloggingthrough all the words."
4,Good case for the money,"Pros:Fits the phone very snuggly. Made of interesting flexible material that fells like a rubbery neoprene like polymer. All buttons of the phone are accessible through the case. The belt clip is sturdy and removable so you can wear the phone on your belt and easily remove and reinstall it on the belt clip without taking the belt clip off of your waist.Cons:You cannot access the keyboard without removing the phone from the case. The clear plastic screen that covers the phone's screen is a little to far from the surface of the phone's screen. This makes it more difficult to press buttons on the phone screen with the stylus near the corners of the screen. The clear plastic screen protector may stretch with use and make this easier but I'm not sure.On the positive side, you can easily cut out the clear plastic screen and still use the case with some extra stick on screen protectors that can be found online."
2,"Good case, shame about the clip","The case, I have no complaints about. The Belt-Clip however leaves a lot to be desired.I had 2 break in less than 1 week, due to the plastic failing where the spring clip is attached.I have now resorted back to an older metal clip from my OEM Motorola case"
5,Libro Perfecto,"Estoy estudiando espanol. Leí este libro para mejorar mi habilidad con el idiom a. Tenía bus car much as palabras in el diccionario y encontrar algunas grades idiomatic poor Google, pero fue vale la pena. Es alguna due las memories libros que he leido y convertió in ejercicio in activida day vertido."
3,Super Reader,"Not too bad, although Allende is clearly not that great an action/adventure writer. The first part of the book should be called 'The Unhappy mother of the boy who it looks like will become Zorro'. Included in this are a few Tom Sawyer type adventures for him and his mate.Points for this though : they get attacked by pirates while ON THEIR RANCH! That is novel. Once they get to Spain, it becomes more interesting, as the boy is old enough for some serious escapades, and the identity of Zorro comes out.After some Napoleonic induced problems there he and his female entourage return to yankeeland and there you get the full on Zorro feel. I think she was perhaps getting the hang of it a bit more by then."
3,Another good Allende story...,"If you love Isabelle Allende, you'll like reading this, the ""true legend of Zorro."" As with all stories, Allende unapologetically weaves magic and mysticism throughout her characters lives. It's always those characters that understand and use their intuition, like Zorro and his mild-brother Bernardo, who have the greatest advantage in Allende's stories. This is mostly a charming tale of how a young, privileged, mischievous boy grew into a legend and a hero in his own community. It is not her best story, but it is easy to read and, as with all her books, it is beautifully written. One word of caution ... this book comes in Spanish or English. Pay close attention to the language of the book before you order."
2,Zorro: a mystical reinvention,"Isabel Allende is a very talented writer. However, she appears to have a great interest in mysticism and she has put as much of it as possible in this book. The original Zorro was a Spanish Nobleman and a Christian who fought on behalf of the poor and oppressed. So, it is ironic that Ms. Allende has tried to tie Zorro to practically every kind of mysticism which existed in the 19th century. She gives him an Indian Shaman for a Grandmother. Has him get the idea for Zorro from an Indian initiation right where he gets the fox (Zorro in Spanish) as his totemic symbol. Has him have an affair with a Gypsi who tells fortunes. Gives him a telepathic connection with his friend Bernardo. Has him join a secret society. And last, but not least, has an extended discussion of Voodoo magic. By the end of the book - I was wondering if this story was more about Zorro or Ms. Allende's attempt to normalize pagan spiritualism."
2,Zorro-a swish off,What a disappointment. This book is to fine novels as white zinfandel is to fine wines. It might work for romantically inclined adolescents; it did not work for me. Ms. Allende has done alot better than this.
3,Not bad,I wouldn't say that this is the best film ever made - it runs hot and cold and drags in places - but it's a very solid introduction to the country.
5,great!,we see kathleen madigan every time she is in town at the local comedy club. she is a great comedian!
1,Buy Something else.,"No, this is not a good choice, there are a couple of funny spots but boring over-all, save your money."
2,"If You Like Cursing, and the ""F Bomb""","If you like cursing, and the ""F Bomb"" you can enjoy this. Frankly, I see nothing comical about including cursing in comedy. There are funnier comedians than Kathleen Madigan who never use a curse word. I am no saint, and I can use expletives, but if I were a comedienne, I wouldn't use the disgusting expletives (publicly) that Kathleen uses. It's as if you are telling the world, ""I have very few morals, and I want the public know...I am proud of that."" It's as if the comedians like Kathleen think that the more they use expletives the funnier they are...NOT so!Two very funny, and clean, comedians are Brian Regan, and Henry Cho.I am sure I am going to get a lot of mail admonishing me. Please save your time. Thanks!"
5,Really Hilarious,"had been listening to her on Laugh USA sirius radio, and decided to order the dvd - SO glad I did! she is very entertaining and captures the essence of irony and situational humor perfectly."
1,Great toy in theory..disappointing in reality,"I bought his for my 3 year old for Christmas, and it worked great...for one day. Now the screen keeps freezing, and it won't play. Of course, they are not available anymore, so there is just nothing I can do. The VideoNow Color for my 5 year old works fine, but the Jr. is a disappointment that is now causing continuous arguements since only one child has a working player!"
1,Motocross Action,"I ordered this product and accidentally had the item sent to me (the billing address) instead of the gift recipient. I IMMEDIATELY made the correction online, and contacted the distributer. The distributer provided emails saying they corrected this error. In February I received the magazine instead of the gift recipient. I sent a SECOND email reminding them of the error and their guarentee to correct the problem. Again, they said they would correct it. It is now March and I am, again, receiving the magazine subscription instead of the intended recpipent, I am incredibly frustrated with their service as it is inconsistant with what they say. I recommend ordering this magazine through a different distributer. Perhaps through Barnes and Noble."
3,Didn't wow me.,"My first dvd in this sort of thing.Am I becoming harder to please regarding animation or have I just seen this elsewhere.I bought it for a backdrop for a party while the tunes were pumpin' but it's not what I expected.I tried to sit through the whole of this but found it redundant,and I got bored and left the room.Not recommended."
1,Uninspiring...,"Uninspiring, or maybe I just have too high standards. Obviously the animator went to great effort to put all this together, but it's BORING AS HELL! Using canned 3D model collection doesn't cut it on a full-length DVD. I've seen better animation by beginning 3D animators."
2,a famous Scottsman,"The reenactments here are not cheesy. There were many actors involved. They had shaggy hair and beards; there were no perfectly clipped, 20th-century coiffes. The horses had those medieval robes. I wonder if the Bruce was really redhead, or if the makers choose red hair just because it's often associated with the Scottish. Also, I couldn't tell if the actor had real or dyed red hair.This work focuses on Bruce's battle dynamics. It is more scant on facts about his life or why the Scots fought the English. This was mostly about war tactics than a biography of a famous person.If I recall correctly, we read about royal successions in my high school European history class. However, people like the Bruce and Braveheart did not come up. I really think this is a documentary by and for Brits. Americans who liked Gibson's ""Braveheart"" will love it. Still, this was not made for a stateside audience because it would have been presented differently if it was."
2,Very disappointing,"I pre-ordered this without even seeing the playlist. Because hey, I couldn't live without ""Everyone Has AIDS"" and ""Pearl Harbor Sucked and I Miss You,"" which will surely become timeless tracks that our grandchildren jitterbug to.But I had been hoping that it would be like the South Park album, with some creative variations by other artists that weren't on the movie.But there aren't. In fact half of the album are instrumentals that are really just filler movie stock but I guess have to be there because otherwise the album would be embarassingly short.Another major disappointment was that the ""I hate you Alec Baldwin"" song from the very end of the credits (yes, there are rewards for sitting to the very end!) was not on the album."
3,"smarty, fun music",Sooo funny and points right at the bonk-stupid things we all know. I loved this movie and I will have this play at my party track.F*ck yeah!
3,"Come on everybody, we got quilting to do!","The songs fromTeam Americaare absolutely hilarious. But they only take up 19 minutes of this 47 minute soundtrack. The rest of the soundtrack features the instrumental score, which isn't all that interesting to listen to. But it's still worth getting the CD just to get the songs."
3,"Has it all, but way too much","The songs are all there, and they provide a lot of laughs. At the end there are some instrumentals that totally lower the mood. They're not funny at all."
3,"Important, but...","... huge chunks of this film did not survive, including many of the actors' performances. The ""restoration"" is basically a few stills and lots of explanatory title cards. Should have been tacked on to one of the other releases in this series."
3,Startling,Forget that the last reel of this film is lost. Forget that it is melodramatic. It is startling to see a film from 1919 deal with this subject. That is enough reason to view it.
1,The tape snapped.,"The tape snapped five minutes after I put it in my machine. My VCR is brand new. It's not the machine. I had to pull it out of my machine. Not good. I realize the tape is used but if it doesn't work, it's useless. I won't buy from you again."
3,A bit 'upity' for the subject matter.,The author knows his subject matter but gets too heavy with all the legal bs and too light on the human stories. Seems like the author couldn't decide if he wanted to write a text book or a down to earth type story.
5,"Outstanding, I could smell the sea air and see the fish.","This book should be required reading in biology and marine life studies, for the fishing industry, fishermen, environmentalists and especially politicians & officials who formulate policy. It is a book for all nations and races, particularly those who depend upon resources from the sea."
2,Better as a series of short stories.,"This book seems to be a hurriedly thrown together series of short stories disguised as chapters. There are some solid ideas here that would be better if explored individually in the 3,000 word range.With plenty of action, an interesting hero duet, and a couple of plot twists this makes great light reading. But it falls apart as a book because it seems to lack cohesiveness. There were simply too many unexplored avenues for me to be satisfied.Buy this book. Read it on a plane. Leave it for someone else and go on."
5,extremely creative - as good as spell singer series,I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It was light-hearted fun and showed a lot of creativity.
4,Jed the Dead Rocks!,"This book, I will admit, was a little slow in a few places, but only reading the first 20 pages of anything doesn't give you enough info to rate it in any way. I really enjoyed reading of the adventures Jed went through. Getting chased across the country by government types and alien nuts is only the beginning."
1,not the usual razors,"I received the razor refills but the packaging was slightly different than what I usually order and the quality was much worse. I contacted the company about this and they assured me that the refills were not imitations of the real refills. I am not sure why the packaging looks different (nowhere does the package say ""for dry skin"" either). The razor goes dull after one use. I cannot return the refills because it is past the two week return limit so I threw them all away. it was a waste of money. Otherwise, i love the intuition refills and from now on I will buy them from the store."
2,Not a good buy,I made a big mistake of buying this external drive without reading other users opinions. This combo firewire drive heats up fast and stops burning CDR/CDRW after 2 successful tries. I ended up with dozens of coasters with this drive. It's a good thing this drive comes with the firewire card that I can use with my other firewire devices. I would like to return it to the vendor but I wouldn't waste my money for the shipping fees and get another .. replacement in return...
3,The description can be confusing.,"The review below is not correctly stated. The fastest burner/speed on the market is 16x (Yamaha LightSpeed). Also there is no such thing as 24x CDs! 4x is not a fast burner, obviously this guy is pretty dumb he probably got a 3 min. burn time because he was only writing a little bit of data to a ""700 MB"" disc."
5,Phantom,The 8 Pin Mini DIN was perfect for my application. I used an ethernet cable to extend the control of a Sony HD camera to 400'. Worked for what i needed and shipped in a matter of days.
4,Good foil tip,"Good quality product. It stands up well to extended practices. The only down side is someone else needs to buy them for the fencing club, not just me :)"
3,"Not bad, good for intermediate level.","The book does provide useful information on using Mts, but it didn't really dealt deeply into the architecture of Mts such as threading management, or the technical interoperations of Mts behind its interfaces. However, I give this book credits for teaching you how to administer Mts environment, and how to incorporate components programming into Mts from an abstraction level of the syntaxing at most for a quick learning into Mts. I also want to mention that the book did included a small bonus section on MSMQ and MAPI, which it did not mentioned on its title. I would give this book one more star if the author did dealt more into this bonus section to make up for any lost point. Overall, it is not a bad book for a quick solution with Mts programming, and I would give it 3 and half star if I can."
3,This book is only for beginner,"If you were a beginner programmer and need to know MTS and ADO, this should be a good starter. However don't expect much beyond this. Mistakes like doesn't know that exceptions raised thru MTS will be passed to the client correctly. The book walk you thru all the samples like a dummy such as keep telling you to uncheck the readonly attributes for every file copied when finishing the samples. If you are an intermediate or above programmer, I would recommend ""Programming Distributed Applications with COM and Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0"" by Ted Pattison."
2,Some good info but bashes VB Developers,"I found some valuable information within this book, however, I lost interest about half way through because of the constant bashing of VB Developers as lazy, etc...I will be seeking another MTS book to round out my knowledge without hearing how stupid I am for trying to do anything with such a lowsy programming language. VB developers are here to stay, live with it!"
3,"Heck of a lot better than other recent releases, but only ok","Some of the tracks on this CD are great, expecially 5 Women, Sarah, When the Lights Go Down, but I almost didn't buy the album because of She Spoke 2 Me. Hello??? This track is not in the Vault, it's available on Girl 6. What a bunch of B.S. for him to even put it on this album. SO basically you get 9 tracks instead of 10, and two or those 9 aren't even really full-fledged songs (Rest of My Life & My Little Pill). I think this album is a rip-off, and the only reason I didn't return the thing is that the three tracks I mentioned are fantastic.I have to admit, I've held faith in him through the last few years of his professional turmoil, but now I'm convinced he's just trying to squeeze his stable fan base for all he can since he knows he'll never get mega-fan sales again. Why else would he include She Spoke 2 Me on this album if not to rip us off?"
3,Warner Who?,"This CD was compiled by Warner Brothers after Prince's contract with them ended. They pulled music that was never to be released from their vault and therefore the title of the album. Unfortunately, most of the material on this CD should have remained in the vault for at least another 50 years with one exception - the song titled ""Extraordinary."" This song made entire album worth hearing."
5,SIMPLY FANTASTIC,"This would have to be one of the best collections of songs that The Artist has brought out. Simply fantastic with the styles and beats that are produced on the album. Once again --- a job well done. Congratulations to The Artist and here's looking forward to the next productions as they only get better as they are released. I have all of The Artists' cds and am proud to say that even though he is misunderstood by many, he is an inspiration to myself as he has entertained me for years with the different styles that he has conjured up in the past and hopefully in the many years ahead."
2,I expected a lot more.,"Prince is the maker of real beauties like 'Purple Rain' or 'Sign...', but you can't compare 'The Vault' with those albums. You expect 10 good songs, but the final result is 6 (the first 5 + Sarah). With only one excellent; 'When the Lights...', that one has a really good vibe. But you can't blame him of course, it wasn't his idea to commercialize this album. And by the way if another good artist made these songs it would be brilliant, but you expect more from this guy."

4,love it,When I first got this CD years ago....I played it to death! From ding to dong...this CD is really good. My favorite track is Extraordinary...classic Prince. What I also like about this CD is that it's more of a Jazz/Bluesy album.....love it
4,Out of Left Field....,"Fans expecting something groundbreaking will be let down somewhat. However, there's some great ballad singing on this disc: ""Extraordinary"" and ""There is Lonely"" are gems."
4,Prince Grows Up,"Although this is supposed to be a ragtag collection of music lying around the WB vaults it sounds remarkably like a themed and cohesive album. The album shows a nice maturity in terms of musical tone for Prince. It's quite a laid back album with a predominance of jazz themes. If you're a long time fan of Prince's you know by now that it's pointless to expect a certain sound from each new album. Those of you who've long given up on hoping for another 1999 sounding record, and allow Prince to musically mature and explore are the most likely to enjoy his music... Those anxiously awaiting ""RAVE"", now have some smooth jams to listen to in the meantime."
5,Smooth....Jazz...Great Grooves,"Ok, we know this is not new material...but it just proves what a great musician can cast aside...the music is very smooth and jazzy...5 women, when the lights go down, and Sarah are the top jams....Great musicianship and great grooves...dont expect the usual groundbreaking material...however enjoy the musicianship."
3,Average Prince material is still better than most music.,"The Artist is known for his musical versatility and ""the Vault...Old Friends 4 Sale"" demonstrates this. These ten tracks, recorded when the Artist was known as Prince, have a jazzy feel sprinkled with funk.In the eighteen years I've been listening to Prince/the Artist and his music, I've heard better from him. This album, however, reminds me of the smooth jams he and his band(s) do in concert.In my humble opinion, even average music from him is still light years better than most music.Give it a try. You might be surprised."
1,AWFUL,"This album was so bad I went back to the music store to return it!With the exception of Extraordinary,This album blows.But I'm blaming Warner Bros. for this and not Prince for two reasons.First,Prince never intended to release this record, which leads me to believe that Warner Bros. tried to make money off him and his fans by releasing such a God forsaken record.Secondly, Out of the hundreds or thousands of songs in princes vault,they chose to release these songs,which also leads me to believe that Warner wanted to sabotage the release of Rave un2 the Joy Fantastic as a possible act of revenge.Well, at least Rave was good compared to this unnecessary record."
3,"Good, but not his best!","I'm sure this CD would sound fresher if you hadn't heard most of these songs on bootleg CDs in the past. However, the CD, which clocks in a just over 40 minutes, is simply too short to stay in my CD player constantly.Don't get me wrong. The songs on this album are fabulous. They just seem kind of unfinished to me. It's also definitely not a pop album. But it's jazzy style is one of the good things about it.Overall, I would give the album a B. Definitely worth picking up, whether you're a Prince fan or just a casual listener. It's a lot of fun!"
3,4 Diehards & Curious Only,"True though it may be that there are a couple of gems here, I think you'll walk away from the table still feeling hungry. Is it better than ""New Power Soul?"" yes, it is, but that's really apples and oranges. If you are familiar with The Artist's bootleg catalog, you know that there is much better stuff out there. How about releasing his cover of ""Just My Imagination?"" We'll see what the 4thcoming ""Rave"" has to offer. Until then get ahold of a copy of ""The Truth"" his best release in years."
2,"A middling, disappointing collection","As a die-hard listener for 15 years, I know Prince has better, more adventurous stuff in his Vault than this collection. As a matter of fact, the title track, ""Old Friends 4 Sale,"" is a different version than the oft-bootlegged one, and is lyrically and musically inferior, in my humble opinion. ""Extraordinary"" and ""5 Women"" are the standouts. Otherwise, you have some great bluesy grooves that ultimately go nowhere, due in large part to the uninspired lyrics accompanying them. For future reference, Prince and/or WB should release less mid-90's NPG stuff and more mid-80's Revolution stuff. In the meantime, let's look forward to Rave Unto the Joy Fantastic . . ."
3,"smooth candy to past the time until ""Rave""","What can you say about a man who can throw a mismash of songs just to fullfill his contract, puts it down on his website, and yet still shows that his music is like no one elses? ""The Rest of My Life"", ""5 Women"" & ""Extroidinary"" are the best bits here, and it just shows that this genious of a ""Artist"" makes you wonder what surprises ""Rave"" will give come November."
3,happier times for prince,"i would have given 4 stars, however, a couple of more songs could have been added to the disc. clocking in at just under 40 minutes, this album is full of gems. starting off with 'the rest of my life', it shows prince in a lighter mood. the 8+ minute 'she spoke to me' is classic prince (way back in the 1980's). and after being disappointed with ""0(+->"" latest releases, aside from 'crystal ball', this album gives us a nice reminder of how the purple one used to sound."
1,Junk,"Junk. Throw away. Has nothing to do with audio quality, I wasn't concerned about that when I bought them, so I don't even know the if the audio quality is adequate or not. They are worthless to use, half of the screws were stripped out as they arrived. They don't clamp a speaker wire. They're too shallow, the side hole is too small, just junk all around."
1,Wouldn't buy again,"Title pretty much sums it up. The set screw is very small. Unless you have a very large diameter wire, 12 gauge or larger, it most likely will not capture the wire or at least it's very difficult to capture the wire. And if you do have large diameter wire you'll want a more robust connector than this one. Very shallow depth which is part of the reason it's hard to lock the screw down on the wire. The tip wobbles as well. I wasted my money on these connectors, now I'm spending more money to order another set from a different manufacturer."
1,Not worth it!,"1. size is too big.2. as many other reviews pointed out, mine stopped working mysteriously too. if anyone has tried replacing the power cord, please let me know if you could revive the stainless piece of junk.3. the final verdict- dont't buy. i can get a decent rice cooker and a steamer with longer longevity for this price."
5,Great Price and service,"I was looking for this item everywhere, and saw Amazon is giving it with a very nice price. Love this rice cooker, looks great and seller's service was awesome"
1,Bad,"The coating on the non stick pot flakes off, the thing boils over, the rice is mediocre, it's ""ok"" but I'm going to do waaaaaay better next time."
1,Never cooks rice to correct consistency,"I have tried so many times to get this thing to make good rice. I have tried different ratios of water to rice, different kinds of rice and every time the rice is either crunchy, mushy or burned on the bottom. I thought that rice makers were supposed to make cooking rice a cinch but that has not been my experience with this appliance. I am tempted to shell out for a fancy japanese rice maker because this one clearly is a waste of counter space."
1,It is not 20-cup rice cooker- HIGHLY MISLEADING Title,"I received the product and I have not used it. However, I am really shocked to notice it is only 10 cup rice cooker, the title says 20-cup rice cooker. I do not want to see such misleading title particularly when we are purchasing on-line. The inner vessel clear marked 10-cups. The outer package says 20cup. I hate this type of misleading marketing of the product."
1,it a disapointment,"the rice cooker work for about two months and just woud not work no more plug it in, and it wont work. i was disapointed with it i have to buy another rice cooker."
1,Mine stopped too!,"Four uses then dead as a doornail. Seems like a simple enough piece of electronics, but I've found the same complaint many places: Four or five meals and goodbye."
2,Not as nice as it looks.,"I had this rice cooker for a little over a year. Then it just up and died. No warning. Used it on Monday, dead on Tuesday. Before dying it worked alright, but if I left the rice on warm for too long it would always burn. So the option of setting it before I left for work was out. Mostly it looked pretty. I expect to get way more than a year from a rice cooker. My cheapie one I had before this lasted at least 5 years. My advice: don't waste your money."
2,After a year it scalds the rice,"Let me start with the fact that I have owned several cheapie rice cookers over the years. Normally after 3-4 years they just die. Not this one. After having it a year, it began running too hot and scalding every batch of rice that we owned. I figured that it was just user error until my husband freaked out one day and demanded that I buy a new one. I'll be purchasing a more reliable brand in the future. I guess spending $200 on a rice cooker might actually be worth it!"
1,Poor performance,This rice cooker is terrible! It cooks much to fast and burns the rice. I was looking for a good rice cooker and this is certainly not it.
1,Don't get fooled,It says 20-Cup but its only 10 cup. It will cook up to 20 but actually its only 10-cup like other 10 cup cooker. People do not bother reading all the details. I bought and had to exchange again and return again.Why do they titled like that?
1,Poor quality; doesn't do a very good job of cooking,"We've had this cooker for about 6 months now, and use it about once a week. At first, it worked just fine. The rice came out perfect and clean up was relatively easy. After about a month or so, the silver paint started flaking off of the interior of the unit, which made me a little queasy wondering if it was getting into the food. Then, the cooker started turning off before the rice was even cooked. Others have said the same thing-- that it's impossible to keep the ""cook"" button depressed no matter what you do. I usually turn it off for a while and then press the button and that seems to do the trick, but having to watch the unit kind of defeats the purpose of a rice cooker. If I wanted that kind of bother, I'd just cook the rice on the stove. Anyway, I would recommend buying another brand of rice cooker; this one was terrible value for the money and I can't wait to get rid of it."
2,Works well until it gives up the ghost,"For the first year we owned this rice cooker it was very nice. Many times we have been cooking rice in it and steaming vegetables in the tray at the same time, and it has always come out nicely. After about 18 months of use, it just flat out stopped working. It worked one day, and the very next day - nothing. No light on the front, no heat from the heating element, nothing. As it was well out of warranty, I took it apart and could find no parts that looked to have failed. All of the electrical connections were solid with no corrosion. No broken or shorted wires, no burned out components. It just gave up the ghost for not apparent reason. Not worth the money."
1,Do not buy!!,I owned a different brand (much cheaper) that I used happily for many years.I then bought this one (not from Amazon) a few months ago and have already decided to junk it.Why? Its almost impossible to clean the way its designed with the removable internal lid. Besides it tends to overcook and burn the food.There are many cheaper models out there that perform much better.Do your self a favor and don't waste your money
2,"Worked well, then died.","I had one of these for about 4 years, and it worked fairly well for that time. Then, last week, it abruptly died. It was on the ""Keep Warm"" setting when the lights suddenly went out, and the machine has not worked since. I have taken it apart to investigate, but I could not find anything wrong with it. My guess is that the wiring or circuits shorted out some place that is hard to see.As I said, it worked well for those 4 years, but I expect a decent appliance to last much longer than that."
1,Constant source of frustration - occasional source of rice,The first rice cooker we received quit working within weeks of purchase. We were able to exchange it and while this one has worked for about a year it hasn't worked well. The button frequently won't stay depressed without wiggling it around or somehow propping it down. The lining of the pan has peeled and it is not very appetizing to think that the paint peeling ended up in our food. Now the cooker has completely stopped working and we haven't had it for much more than a year. Waste of money.Constant source of frustration - occasional source of rice
2,Not good,"Mine stopped working in just over a year. I'm not so sad, though -- it never made good rice. It was always burned at the bottom.On the plus side, it was easy to clean. . ."
5,1 of my favorite books!!!!!!!!,My favorite part was the drawings! I also thought how the chapters were actually named after Mandy's felt pens was cool. I was on the edge of my seat when Tanya shoplifted.I INSIST YOU READ THIS BOOK!
1,Battery is hard to find and doesn't last,"The so-called ""long-life replaceable battery"" is impossible to get without going through the manufacturer. I have had the scale since 2002. It is a nice scale, but pretty worthless without the battery. I got a replacement battery by going through the manufacturer once, but it was quite a hassle, the battery was expensive, and it is already dead again a couple of years later--and the scale is hardly used. Please comment on this review if you know where I can find a battery."
1,Read this before you purchase Rowenta,"I have this scale. I cannot give it any stars until they offer a replacement battery without going to France. I live in a big city with all kinds of batteries, but not this one!!!!I do not want to write or try to find the manufacturer of this battery. I want to simply locate one closeby. It's not worth it.American companies that sell products without being able to supply batteries and parts should think twice!If there are batteries here that can be substituted for a green lithium 3.6 volt battery, please offer it above separately. They say in the brochure that the battery lasts 10 years. Mine lasted 2 years with one person weighing not more than 1 time a day.I now have no scale as I have no battery."
3,NOT accurate as promised,"yes, a beautiful scale, large, happy on your barefeet, good readout.... ah, if only it was the accurate thing they promised... I'm going to return mine to see if the 2nd one works right. This one is inaccurate in that the weight swings 7 lbs one way or the other, within a half an hour.... 10 different weighings withint 30 minutes gave 10 different readings ... not ""broken"" really, but clearly less accurate than even the cheapest analog scales. But, hey, if everyone else loves it, maybe this one is just messed up too, so hopefully the replacement will work better."
2,Not for expert players,"I decided to buy this mat because I was getting tired of the foam mats breaking after a few weeks of use, and after playing 3 songs I put it right back in the box and returned it. In order to get steps to register on this mat you practically have to stomp on the arrows. Most of the songs I play are high difficulty and fast moving so I don't have time to stomp on every arrow to get it to register. Definitely not worth the money, I will sticking with the foam mats for now."
2,Not For Nintendo Wii,Shame on Amazon for this fairly deceptive platform description. This pad DOES NOT WORK with a current or newly purchased model Wii console. It only works with old model types with game cube connectors.
2,do not buy!,"I bought this dance pad after much frustration with a soft cheaper version that my family practically abused. (we used it probably like 2 hours a day, heavy use) I thought by buying the metal one i would not have that problem. I plugged it in to the computer ( i used the USB) and i thought i just didint know how to use it because it was barely responding. i had to jump really hard to get any kind of response. the top arrow was completely broken. I packed it up and was also very frustrated when i emailed that i wanted to return it. After a couple emails, back and forth, by the last one i was pretty rude and frustrated and they finally gave me an address to return it to. At first i was given a number of the owner i guess to call and say what was wrong. i called and it was the wrong number (i wasn't given any email address). Ive always been happy in general with amazon, but this was a really bad experience! I'm planning on buying another soft one, and it will last as long as it will"
4,One of the few good films to come out early about Korea,"My 1st time that I saw this film was as a young wanna be GI. After the Army and as a Teacher I met ""Short Round"" who happened to become my Principal named Bill Chun. (A really good man and an excellent Principal.) He has regaled me with tales of his short Movie career and they were amusing. He had nothing but good things to say about the cast and the film. I commned it to you for a worms eye view of the ""Old Army"". By the by Mr. Chun did a hitch in the Regular Army in the late 50's later on before going into teaching."
4,Excellent Film,"Okay, pure and simple--like everyone else, James Franco nailed this performance. This film has him in most every frame and he carries the film. The supporting actors are excellent as well, but James Franco is the film. This is a great look into the character and myth of James Dean. My only complaint is it is much too short. This film needs to be another hour longer at least but all in all, the film is a must see for those who are interested in James Dean. Too bad the dvd contains no more extras than a couple of trailers. The music over the film and main menu is soulful and sad and reminds us all of a time gone by."
5,Franco retells the legend,great movie and its a tv movie and i enjoyed it beacause I love James Dean. Franco is really the person to do the job ro retell how his life went and how it suddenly left after the tradgic car crash. thought the movie at the end said the guessed on some of the parts and it doesnt bother me. the actors really doa good job portraying who Dean worked with. a gem of a movie. a must have in anyones collection or if anyone is a fan of Dean
5,Amazing portrayal of James Dean,"James Franco does an amazing job portraying James Dean. He portrayed all of the sadness and pain in Dean's life with such accuracy that it is no wonder he won an award for his performance. This biography wasn't dry or uninteresting. In fact, it captures your attention from start to finish. Anyone who wants to learn more about James Dean or simply watch an interesting bio should definitely see this movie!"
4,James Dean,"I liked this movie a lot...because I am a James Franco fan. He is gorgeous and does a really good job as James Dean. However, I have seen all the James Dean movies...and nothing/noone compares to him and his acting. I couldn't quite bring myself to giving it a 5 star but it's worth viewing!"
2,Second Best,"James Franco may resemble James Dean; however, he doesn't quite pull off this biographical screenplay. Other movie star roles not at all like the originals. For real James Dean fans, I feel this is sub-par to others."
4,The Legend Lives On,"This film portrays the life of one the most talented and genius actors of the 20th century. After watching the movie, I feel as though I have a better understanding of what made this very mysterious young man tick. I believe that you have to get into the mind of a person to fully appreciate them and Franco's performance may be the closest we ever get to actually ""knowing"" the late Dean. the events of the movie show Dean's life from childhood and his struggles to the Big Apple and eventually in Hollywood. It also portrays his personal relationships with his family and co-workers. I recommend this film to any Dean fans or to anyone wanting to know about James Dean."
3,For James Franco fans,"I enjoyed James Franco's performance more than this films portrayal of James Dean's life. The film only touched on the surface of who James Dean was. You learn the events of his life, not so much about him as a person. I think there was alot more to James Dean than what this film portrays.If you are a James Franco fan then you will enjoy watching this dvd."
2,Disappointed,"They made Dean seem to be one dimensional. They showed his ""rebel"" side as very dominant with just a touch of lonely boy and jokester. I couldn't even imagine him ever slapping Pier! Where did THAT come from? I DID like the reinactments of the scenes from his movies and the early scenes of Dean as a child.I'd like to see a movie made from input with the people who knew him and are still alive to say, ""Jimmy did/didn't do that."" I don't need his life in chronological order. I just want the facts. He was fascinating enough not to need embellishing."
3,James Dean--Re-Invented,"James Dean, the TNT movie which premiered on August 5, 2001, is a worthy piece of fiction. Most notable for the remarkable performance of James Franco, any resemblence to James Dean's real life is purely coincidental. While I am happy that a movie about James Dean's life was made because it introduces this remarkable actor to a whole new generation of people, anyone well-versed in Dean's REAL life has to come away from this TNT REEL version of it, disappointed. Dean's short life was dramatic enough without additions or embelishments. This movie takes gigantic liberties with the truth which are unneccesary and jarring. At the same time, it is an affecting drama and James Franco's performance is worthy of the Golden Globe and Critics' Choice awards he won for his portrayal of Dean. I hope that TNT's effort will inspire people to seek out and watch the original performances of one of the most gifted and unique performers in movie history--James Dean."
5,Not bad for a Television movie,"James Franco was superb and awsome in the role of James Dean. Usually television movies provide poor acting and story line. But this was different. It has great acting by James Franco, and so much happens in Deans life that the script can't be that poor. The only bad part is the running time, because a lot of things happen so fast, I guesse it would need to since it only runs for 95min not including commercials, it shouls have been extended by about fifteen minutes, then it would have been a perfect film. The film was awsome although it needed some changes a little, since some parts were educated guesses. But other than that, the film was awsome."
3,Slight course adjustment,"Peter Agnew offers an outstanding, accurate description and assesment of Landberk's ""Indian Summer,"" with one important exception: singer Patric Helje and his lyrics are about as exciting as a bowl of low-sugar vanilla pudding. Only by the truly terrible standards of prog vocalists is he textured and expressive. If that matters a lot to you, a re-think about Landberk is in order."
4,Final Album.,They find their signature sound in what is their last album till date(they seem to have borken up now). This is overall a stronger album that One Man with very impressive songs like 'All Around Me' the rockier '1st of May' and the very impressive 'Dustgod'(which could have been a huge single if they had been a more popular band). The singer sounds a lot like the U2 guy in this album. There is no boring parts on this album unlike their previous full length.Also check out related bands Paatos and Morte Macabre.
4,"Progressive, Nordic and modern","Almost a five star for me. While remaining truly progressive, Landberk sounds very modern, mainly due to the guitar work. This is probably what Radiohead might sound like if they decided to go progressive. The slower passages are very Nordic and melancholic."
5,PLANET EARTH -WOW!!,"I just recently purchased a Samsung 58 inch plasma TV and the first Blu Ray discs I purchased were the BBC Earth Collection (Planet Earth/Earth:The Biography). This is truly amazing video. The picture quality is unbelieveable and you will find yourself saying ""How did they film that?"". Everyone in the family plus all your frieds will marvel at these images. The price through Amazon was the best I could find on the web and these multi-disc sets will be watched over and over again. These videos truly allow HD to be all it can be."
1,Not so great.,"I left my good ear buds at home so I bought these today from my school store. I'm at school from about eight in the morning till 4pm, with many breaks in between, so I have to be able to listen to my music. I picked these up for under $12 dollars so I didn't expect too much from them, but I am really disappointed. The sound is tinny and weak. They don't block out a lot of outside noise, but instead make everything sound really weird and almost intensified. This guy next to me was flipping through some papers and it was driving me nuts.I would not suggest anyone buy these unless you have never had a good pair of headphones, in which case you won't know what you're missing.I just saw a girl walking down the hallway wearing these in blue, so I may just be picky. They do look really neat.Check out some JVC headphones in the $30 range if you want something inexpensive with amazing sound. I've had a pair for almost two years that are amazing."
3,Fits the iphone jack,"I just bought these in white as a replacement for my headphones at the gym for my ipod. I am also happy as it fits that narrow jack on the iphone. I don't like the fit of the standard iphone 'phones, so I'll try this for listening (but not take calls as this is obviously not a microphone).For the $10 I paid at a store, it seems okay, nothing special. The sound is decent for the price. The tips are rubber cups that seems to hold in the ear well."
1,terrible,"I bought these because the headphones that come with the i-pod hurt my ears. Unfortunately, these are quite possibly the worst headphones I have ever used. The sound is terrible and completely muffled. It's not even close to the sharp sound that you would expect from a decent pair. The volume is awful as well. I would rather deal with the pain from the apple headphones."
2,Other review was wrong in my opinion,"I bought these because my girlfriend wanted pink headphones and they had a 5 star rating, I listened to them and felt cheated because my generic gpx stock headphones sounded better in every way I would not buy this product again"
4,The lightw weight earphones,"The earphones are nice and lightweight, only problem I have had is the little ends that suppose to help fit your ear, want to come off. I was concerned they would get lost."
2,Not worth it,"They match the theme I had going with my macbook and iPhone but the sound... terrible! At first I thought that I had them in incorrectly so I changed which earbud covers I had on them but no, they make music flat and dull. The volume control didn't do much, I have that control set up nicely on my itunes. In all it's pretty junk and don't waste your $10+shipping on them. Save the money and get a quality Sony set. I tossed these after one day of owning them."
2,"wears okay, sounds mediocre",This earphone maybe good for listening to spoken audio but the music is boxy in sound quality - like cupping your ears listen to loud music. I liked the volume control and the color but sound quality was just mediocre.
1,Where is the sound?,"After receiving the item i immediately tested them. the sound quality was horrible. its as if you were in an underwater cave and all u hear is the bass. Also, they are quite difficult to get into your ears, like honestly who thought of these things."
5,Balanced Health creates a Better Life,"Dr. Walt has another winner with God's Design for the Highly Healthy person. This book is designed to rapidly educate you about the steps to take to acheive a healthy lifestyle and more importantly, how to maintain it for life. The roadblock of experiencing a healthier lifestyle is knocked down by the medical and spiritual insights from this practical resource. It's a simple way to add years to your life and worth checking out."
2,Loved the characters; language juvenile,"Doyle obviously has a feel for his characters but, please, I find it very difficult to believe that a grown man with grown children would habitually speak with the grossness usually employed by adolescent boys. Wonder if anyone has counted the number of ""fucks"" Jimmy Sr. uses in a 311-page book--bet the percentage of the total words would be a shocker. Yep, I'm sombody's grandmother, but I'm also a totally devoted reader of great fiction written in all styles and tones; Doyle's redundant use of the ""F"" word was tiresome and detracted from his otherwise fine story and characters."
5,For all women young and old,"I bought this book for my daughter, but now that I've really looked at it, I'm buying it for all the terrific women in my life. It is inspiring and the big stage spread in the middle is incredible. Really - you MUST take a look at this book for yourself!"
5,A is for Abigail,"I bought this book for my eight year old daughter, who absolutely loves history! She loved this book, as did I. The book goes through the alphabet recognizing different women of history who have contributed to this great nation. The illustration, in my opinion, is wonderful. Hats off to Lynne Cheney and Robin Preiss Glasser. Well Done!"
2,Not enough diversity and ... tired of celebrity authors,"Book was given to me as a gift. I found it readable book and admire the subject, but I agree that there isn't enough diversity in the types, backgrounds, races of women. Plus, am this celebrity author trend...very tiresome. It seems just another instance of our celebrity-worshipping culture."
3,Enjoyable L-I-T-E Reading,"An informed and anecdotal account of the process of making indie films from the talented and accomplished Polish Brothers. However, it's a bit remedial and general for the initiated filmmaker. There are a couple of bonafide pearls of wisdom and the book moves right along, covering the process of making indies. Which makes it a fun read, but for my time and money there are much better books on independent filmmaking."
5,A thoroughly enjoyable book!,I absolutely loved this book. I stumbled upon it at the library and checked it out. I was captivated from the first paragraph. How wonderful a story that combines the bittersweet of life and death and the eventual balancing of the scales. I hated to see it end!
4,Makes you Wonder,"the book was pretty good, it leaves you with sort of a mystery in regards to the dead and the living. Its definetly worth reading, and makes you wonder a little about the non-existance. I say if youv'e never believed in ghost, after reading this book, you might have second thoughts. 4 stars!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,wonderful writer,"I picked this up after thoroughly enjoying Reynolds'The Rapture of Canaanand a second novel as strong as this proves she's a solid writer.Finch Nobles is the ideal cemetery groundskeeper with her badly burned face and neck and courageous spinster attitude. She is able to hear the dead and learn of the angst, heartache, and unforgiveness that has followed them to their graves. Acting as a mouthpiece for the newly dead, Finch learns to better understand the living.A short and sweet read that is energetic and fulfilling in its mission as a novel: to entertain and to teach."
5,Wonderful Book,"This book draws you in and really holds your attention. The writer picks you up and plops you down in the world of these characters. You can really identify with the main charactor and how she views the world. Eccentric characters flow through this book but are not cliche. If you enjoy good writing, Southern humor,lean a little toward the eccentric..read this. The book is very well written and one of my favorites."
4,Looking Within and Beyond,"A Gracious Plenty is the story of Finch who was badly burned and disfigued as a child. Finch is fiesty, often stubborn, and can communicate with the dead. After her parents die, Finch assumes ownership of the graveyard where she tends the dead.Finch is a woman that had socially isolated herself. She has no friends, but everyone knows her. Her scars are what sets her apart. Instead of feeling saddened and desperate, Finch is often hostile. It is through the hostility that she hides her pain and longing for true relationshipsA Gracious Plenty explores the need for relationships and how people must look both within and beyond what they initially see. Finch is a character that must first accept herself before others can accept her. Follow Finch as she communicates with both the dead and the living and begins to grow beyond her personal and social demons.A remarkable novel from Sheri Reynolds, her immagination and creativity do not seem to know any bounds."
4,It's A Must Read,"Gracious Plenty is a intersting book to read even though it's a non-fiction book it will keep your mind wondering what's going to happen next. The book has only one flaw it holds no pictures, which could have made it more amusing if i could actually see the dead people. I would recommend this book to people that are into mysterys and ghosts."
4,Great and mysterious book,I really liked A Gracious Plenty by Sheri Reynolds. It shows a creative interpretation of communication with the dead. It also shows what it feels like to be rejected by people and how to seek comfort in your true friends.
5,Marvellous!,"I just finished A Gracious Plenty a few days ago and I loved it. Sheri Reynolds has an amazingly unique writing style, and I look forward to seeing more of her work. I thought Finch Nobles was a very extraordinary character. I know this is a book I will recommend to all my friends and want to read again and again."
3,a girls story life (english 51 a),"This book talks about a girl talking to ghosts. I liked what i read so far. I only read not even half of the book, so i can't say much about it. I would recommend for people to read the book if you like ghost things. Besides me reading some of it for my class, I also was told that it's a really good book from other students that read it. I think from what I heard it'll be a book to enjoy reading."
5,Sheri Reynolds is amazing!,"I loved this novel! I bought this book after reading Reynolds' novel, The Rapture of Canaan, because I just loved her style of writing. I've decided that Reynolds is one of my favorite writers.Reynolds has once again created many characters that will stay in my mind for quite some time! The book is wonderfully written & the stories are perfectly told.I highly recommend this book to everyone -- especially those who have read The Rapture of Canaan (liked it or not) & to those that usually enjoy the types of books from ""Oprah's book club""."
4,Hard to find,"This CD contains note-perfect jazz by exceptional players. It is one of the Chet Baker CD that I own that I covet most, partly because it is so difficult to acquire."
4,The only two-way dictionary they make!,"The 'Concise Scots Dictionary' is only Scots-English; and the 'Concise English-Scots Dictionary' is only English-Scots! You MUST get the 'Essential' one.(But having said that, I don't know much about this other 'Hippocrene (Sc-En En-Sc) Dictionary' -- maybe that's good, too.)I hate to admit it, and all things are equal, but you really have to say, English manufactures are slightly superior to Scottish. (I dunno, maybe they're just better at planning obsolescence (-/making it look unintentional).)"
5,Sweet Game,"Test Drive LeMans is an awesome game. The graphics are sweet, i would compare them to Gran Turismo in some ways. This Game has lots of different cars and many modes of play. From Quick race to the actual 24 hour race(this will take some patience). It has something for every race fan. What i really like about this game is not just the graphics but all the little details. When your racing the sky changes, the clouds move, it will start to sprinkle then a down pour. Plus when ever you go off the track it leaves trails in the dirt or grass, and it just doesn't go away after awhile, it stays, its just neat to see where other cars or yourself have gone off the track. I know its not something to get excited about but it just makes the game a lot more real. Test Drive LeMans is a great great game, if you don't have, then your missing out on a sweet Dreamcast Game."
4,Bringing you back,"This book is a must have for those of us that have hiked any part of the AT. As you paruse the pictures, it brings you back to when you were there."
4,Pleasant Memories remembered,"Not Carrying a Camera, these photo's bring back some of the memories of scenes we did not have a camera to capture them with"
5,Best Book EVER!!,Hey i'm courtney(...).My big sister bought this book for me after i watched the movie and i loved all for stories.The book is about 5 girls who dream about being singing sensations.If you wanna be a singer you MUST read this book NOW!!
3,Parent Review,"I bought this for twin 9 yr old daughters, who love the movies. They said that the books are boring. I'm not very happy since I bought the entire collection. I hope that they decide to read the books in the future."
3,A good collection of early Poco,"This collection is a pretty well thought through study of early Poco with all the hits up to Cantamos. Includes Good Feelin to Know, Bad Weather and a medley off Deliverin. Two Buffalo Springfield tunes fine their way here (Kind Woman & Go and Say Goodbye)the second one should not be here being a weak effort compared with the Stills original. But the sing along feel good country rock of Just for Me and You (Underrated) My Kind of Love and Pickin up the pieces all appear. Faith in the Families off Seven is mid period Poco as is What Ever Happened to Your smile and are a wee bit out of place here. Room perhaps should have been found for Here We Go Again which was Tim Schmit`s greatest moment, and Settlin` Down, Blue Water. The good news is that all these can be found on The Forgotten Trail which is the superior collection. Get it instead."
5,Funniest Movie EVER!!! Typical Hepburn yet... NOT TYPICAL at the same time.,"Over acting, popular actors making blatant mockeries of themselves and Hollywood in general, Tony Curtis as a beat method actor with low billing,William Holden dressed as a spaghetti western star, Hepburn on the floor of the limo cuz her princess hat is too tall for the car, on and on and on! Not to mention that Parcheezi will never mean the same thing to my husband and I after watching this fantastic, original, if not predictable romantic comedy. I was so happy I watched it and disappointed I had not seen it before. I will recommend this to everyone who likes movies like ""what's Up Doc?"", ""TopHat"", ""It's Only Money"" and ""Do Not Disturb"" and for any fan of serendipity, as findng this movie was so for me!"
5,I love Audrey,I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE the beautiful Audrey Hepburn... I want everything of hers! My whole room is of her. I want all her movies n I'm getting them all...
4,I love it...,"I am one of the few people I know who loves this movie. I think it is sweet, and weird, and funny. It does, however, require a really long attention span, which few of my relatives have. I think it was 'Alex & Emma' before 'Alex & Emma', but in my opinion: it's far better."
2,disappointing,This is not one of Audrey's best. The plot is a little too crazy for my taste even though I am normally a HUGE fan.
1,Oh my!,I was so dissapointed!I kept watching just thinking it would get better.WRONG!Don't waste your time. This is painful!
5,Bought as a gift,"I can't really say much about the product... I bought it for my sister who is an Audrey Hepburn fan and I personally haven't seen the flick...Anyway, cover looks great :-)"
4,"It's silly, but it still sizzles...","Admittedly, this is neither Holden's nor Hepburn's premiere work. However, there is still some good writing in this film. Clever dialogue manifesting itself best in the recurring bit about the ""liar and a thief suit"" garners laughs fromk me and my family every time we watch this film. Some great campiness and send-ups of movie and book genres; and Tony Curtis making fun of Marlon Brando's acting style is classic.... It's not a perfect movie, but it certainly delivers in the humor department."
1,Paris When It Fizzles,"In 1964 when this movie came out in the theaters the reviews it got were not good. I was 14 at the time and remember my mother reading about it in the newspaper, and the headline for this movie was ""Paris When It Fizzles."" There was little chemistry between Hepburn and Holden. When I finally saw the movie. They were right. I simply like both actors, mainly because I liked them in ""Sabrina"" but, like the critics said; it fizzled."
2,Not Enough Sizzle,I think the title of my review says it all. The movie was hard to watch and did not do Audrey justice. I'm a fan of hers but that was not enough to get me into this movie.
2,Not Much Sizzle!,"The premise of this plot is not bad, but the execution is labored and sometimes too off the wall. With a great starring cast it is a big disappointment."
3,idea with possibilities wasted,"The screenwriter had no idea how to write a comedy. Add to that casting a dramatic actor (Holden) to play a comic part, and you end up with a flop. With a comic actor (like, say, Tony Randall) and with a comic script, this could have been a very funny movie. Compare this movie with ""Delirious(John Candy)"" and you'll see what I mean.The purpose of this story by two Frenchmen seemed to be to show how much they hated American movies. Every movie from the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s is lampooned. But satire does not succeed when the satirist hates his subject so much that he can't be funny about it.The enjoyable parts are the appearances by other stars: Marlene Dietrich, Fred Astaire (singing only), Frank Sinatra (singing a couple of lines), Tony Curtis hamming it up, Mel Ferrar, and Noel Coward (the only comedian of the lot).Hepburn is given almost nothing to do and has no opportunity to save this picture. Holden tries hard, very hard, but he just doesn't know how to be funny."
4,PARIS WHEN IT SIZZLES,"A real ""cheer me up"" film although I would have liked to have seen more of Paris. See it for the fashions, that face and the romance in all of us."
3,It's What Happened Off-Camera,"So...it's not a great movie. It's not Audrey's best. It's not Bill's best. It's not even their ""good"" or ""decent."" The script is/was a mess. The director pushed cameo roles onto stars who just visited the set (Tony Curtis, Noel Coward, etc).So...why the three stars? It's no secret that Holden and Hepburn had fallen for each other years earlier (read the bios). This movie is not for the romantic who wants to see a love story between characters, but the romantic who wants to see a love story between actors. This can even be used as a case study to show when people who love each other work together."
3,I hate to do this...,"but this movie is not worth more. I love Audrey Hepburn but the plot is atrocious. The actors are good and it can be funny but the plot is definitely lacking. It involves a woman going to Paris to type a play that Holden's character is supposed to have written. The only problem is that he hasn't written it and he only has a few days left. From there the two try to develop a plot with ideas that range from spies to thieves to vampires. Basically what you are witnessing is a writer's failed attempt to develop a good story. If you want a good comedy or you just want to see Audrey Hepburn at her finest try Roman Holiday, Breakfast at Tiffany's, or Sabrina."
2,Only for Hardcore Fans,"Movies about moviemaking are generally narcissistic exercises, and this film is no exception. Too bad so many inexperienced filmmakers get caught in the classic trap of making a film about their own activities. Here it is done with a big budget and two of my favorite stars. It is said this film sat in the can for two years before it was released so this is Holden/Hepburn (reunited after Sabrina) circa 1961/62. The story is dull, fluffy and filling like whipped cream, the dialogue is reasonably good, and I am a great fan of both these people. The period of the early 60's offers forth it's abundant and wasteful values, interesting just in that aspect alone. I love that apartment. Audrey is absolutely gorgeous, William is in unbelievable shape, and they both exude huge amounts of energy all for a bunch of fluff. Enjoy!"
2,"Lovely as usual, Audrey couldn't do it all on her own","For once I have to agree with Leonard Maltin. This movie shouldn't have been. Although Audrey gave her usual gracious and beautiful performance, she seemed at times to be wondering how she could rescue this movie from disaster. I'm also a Wm Holden fan, but in this film he appeared to be dissipated & cynical and really not worth the trouble she was taking to save him. They both could do, and have done, so much better. What a waste of talent!"
1,Not even Audrey can salvage this one....,"I agree with the viewers from Texas -- this was AWFUL! I couldn't wait for it to end. And until seeing this, I didn't think Audrey had made any truly bad movies. It's completely silly and pointless, and the vampire scene alone made me wonder if the writers and producers were on drugs when they made this."
1,paris when it sizzles,We were VERY DISAPPOINTED !!!! I rented this movie to take with us on our flight to Paris. I rented it LATE the night before and we were informed that our rental had expired only a couple of hours after the order had been received. You can see our disappointment as we were looking forward to viewing this on our trip. I was charged the full rental price for NO MOVIE !!
1,paris doesnt sizzle,"Thinking with these two stars,this film cant be bad- I was wrong- this movie is terrible=-dont waste your money- if you want Paris- get ""Midnight in Paris' with Woody Allen- not this- as I watched it I thought 'these two must have been paid well to be in this junk- pass on it- ramcaleer"
2,Gloves are not like the picture,"Imagine the cheapest looking, thin, ugly, pair of plain white work gloves, that what you get. I gave this as a gift and was horrified when she opened the box. Don't be fooled by the picture. They must have run out of the pictured gloves so they substituted the cheapest gloves they could find. Shame on you Rumford!"
5,robeez toddler,"I was familar with robeez brand, but was pleasantly suprised to find them in this large size. I was spoiled with robeez from purchasing 12-18 months size but I have been stuck since then not realizing that they came in larger sizes. This is now my third pair of robeez from 6-12 mos, 12-18 mos and this one 3-4, I guess I will have to get the 2-3 to have a complete collection. Free shipping and awesome product, because my toddler is at that picky stage and he just loves the race car. If you haven't tried robeez, try 'em you and you child will love it."
3,"It works fine, but quality is cheap","The product looks just as described, and functionality is OK. The problem is that it's a bit complicated to pull out the whole pod: that's where low quality shows up. It works properly, but all the time I'm afraid that it could break up."
1,problemic coffee maker,"This coffee maker is beautiful, however, it has a problem. The on off switch sticks a lot. Kitchen Aid replaced the entire system for me a few times and finally I gave up and bought a cheaper more reliable coffee maker. All the replacements they sent to me developed the same problem."
4,"OK for large pots, but....",".... this is a great coffee maker if you make 8 or more cups at a time. When this machine arrived from Amazon, I had a house full of company, so we used to to make full pots. After the house guests left, I went back to my morning ritual of making 4-5 cups at a time, and discovered that this machine just can't make a decent short pot of coffee.I also discovered that it is a tiny bit taller than the specs say, so it may not fit under your kitchen cabinets!Other than that, it is built like a tank and nicely finished. If you normally make smaller pots, look elsewhere."
2,Great-until it's not! Back to my French Press,"Initially, I loved this coffee maker. Coffee always hot and smooth tasting-despite dribble when pouring. These units have major electrical issues. I have had 3 units replaced. Pouring the full amount of water into the unit until the ""beep"" sounds can trigger some sort of signal that makes it stop working permanently. Now my 4th coffee maker makes coffee, but heating element no longer works. Kitchen Aid HAS to know about these problems, and has done nothing. They have replaced the units, but with units with the same problem. Who makes these things for KitchenAid?"
1,Manhattan Skyscrapers: Revised,Excellent photos but too much emphasis on the newest boxy glass cubes.
2,Not the best of the Spot Lift-a-flap books.,"Our daughter really enjoys the Spot Lift-a-flap books. This one, however, leaves much to be desired. The primary surprises under the flaps are dialogue - which a pre-schooler can't read. The other Spot books have pictures under the flaps. Still, we reach for these books night after night!"
5,Spot Goes to the Park,"I am a Mommy and Me teacher, and I teach over 100 children per week ages 4 months to 4 years in my Fitness n' Play program, I read this book in my Story Time and the children just love it, I own just about every Spot book ever written, they are the greatest!"
3,not much park vocabulary,"My son, almost two, likes this enough to read it, but it is not a favorite. I was disappointed because there's not much ""park"" vocabulary in it at all, which is what we were looking forward to."
2,Not as good as Where's Spot,"We bought this hoping my son would take to it after ""where's spot"" was such a hit. No go, he's totally uninterested."
2,"cute, but not durable","This is a cute story, but my 16-mo-old had the flaps ripped off three of the pages LITERALLY within 10 minutes after introducing this book. Even tho it is a board-book construction, the flaps are only paper and not built to last. With so many other titles to choose from, why bother?"
3,Not terrific,"I wanted a Rowenta Iron because for more than several years friends had raved about them. I like to iron with copious amounts of steam and a very hot iron, and hoped I would get that from this iron. I bought the least expensive in the Rowenta line, which was likely my error. It is not much different from my former irons, all less expensive American makes. (This iron is made in Mexico - like most irons nowadays.) In addition, the way you see the water level is actually rather awkward. Nothing special about this model, and I would not recommend it. The one thing that I haven't tested is how long it will last - which only time will tell. In all, not worth the extra money."
1,Could Have Burned the House Down,"My mom was ironing and turned away from the project to pick up some more material. She smelled something burning and turned around to see her iron smoking. Before she could unplug the iron, melted material fell out of the bottom and burned holes in her carpet. She tossed the iron out onto the front lawn where it burned the grass where it landed. It was a good thing she never left the room. The inside of the iron melted. To say the least, she will never buy a Rowenta again."
5,Rowenta DM-253 Powerglide,Love this iron. I am an avid sewer/quilter and it is hard to find an iron without the automatic turn off feature.
1,Fire hazard,We purchased the Rowenta powerglide 2 model dm-253 around 1998. It is 2011 now and the cord coming out of the iron ignited just now. My wife quickly unplugged it. Luckily the fire did not catch anything on fire.
1,No you should not spend 5.95 on this 2-page article,"Anyone who has read Asch already knows far, far more about him than this article can tell them. You will not learn ONE THING that you could not have found from Wikipedia or some other free source or do not already know. Very disappointing and no way is it worth spending money on. One gets the feeling that the author did not attend the conference nor even read RECONSIDERED.Rip off."
2,Disappointed with this kit,"Shipping was slower than other orders I made.The 3 in 1 Audio Video Cable passes sound OK but sending NTSC signal to a NTSC television comes up with a scrambled picture.The Travel Charger connector does not fit into the Zune, useless.The Car Charger is OK and the connector fits.This kit is not a good value at all. Recommend don't buy."
2,Sex in Chains,"I purchased this DVD based on the information provided. Though it was entertaining, it was nothing like what the title or the description described."
1,I hate it because it is non arrived!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Commande soi-disant ""shipped"" fin octobre 2009 et toujours pas arrivée ce 20 décembre 2009..... Comment faire pour se plaindre auprès d'Amazon?"
5,Great cable,I've been using it for a month and I like it a lot. It doesn't feel cheap like my old cables and the connectors feel sturdy. They have a lifetime guarantee so I think that's enough to prove the quality. I totally recommend these cables.
4,unmasked,"This book makes sense out of oddity. I cried as I read the first few chapters, not knowing why. My life and feelings make more sense. So many 'issues' I didn't realize had a foundation. I've passed it along to my husband, hoping he can better understand the 'brat life'. I wouldn't have missed the life, but almost missed the book.A MUST read for military families and for civilians trying to understand their military husbands, wives or children."
2,A couple of chapters were good... most not so good.,"I never thought of Brats as 'victims.' Yet, this book portrayed us brats - all brats - as victims of all types abuse, mental and physical. I certainly didn't see the prevelance of alcohol (that this book seems to think is the #1 evil in all military families) in the families I grew up with and was very close to, including mine. There were definitly a couple of chapters that I'm glad I got to read and really hit home! But overall... it just was way too negative! I think I lived a very good life as a Brat... this book makes you think that no brat ever did."
5,lightning flashes,"By the time I finished MILITARY BRATS, there weren't just lightbulbs going off, there were flashes of lightning. Always on the move as a kid, I'd never felt as if I belonged anywhere, but Wertsch's book actually showed me the place where I had roots. Granted the military culture is unusual, challenging, and often dysfunctional, but it was my hometown. It had shaped my life and personality; understanding it helped me understand myself and my family in a whole new way. Thank you, Mary Wertsch, for reading my mind and heart!"
4,Great read for a military brat,"This book changed the way I view myself as a military brat. I've recently begun to research topics related to military families, and military brats. Being an Air Force brat, I have a lot of questions and issues that I'm trying to get through as a result of my childhood. Reading this book was an emotional roller-coaster for me. It made me realize that I'm not the only military brat with the feelings and issues I have.However, this book is targeted to an older generation. I'm 20 and my father never served in either of the World Wars, he barely served in the mess in the Middle-East. Many of the military brats interviewed for this book had fathers that were wounded (or killed) in WW2. But I've found that most of the information out there for military brats revolvs around that time-frame.I would recommend this book to any military-brat, especially those that are trying to deal with the effects of their childhood."
2,"Pretty good, but there are better","As a Foreign Service Brat, it is interesting to read how close some military experiences and how far others are from my own, and Wertsch's book was certianly well written. While I enjoyed it and certainly found it well documented, I thought Mary Truscott's Brats: Children of the American Military Speak Out a much better read. I have a problem with the way Wertsch used a metaphor and then ran with it for the entire book. I would say in general that Wertsch's book is a great resource for a person writing a paper, while the human side of the experience is better brought across by Truscott. The one caveat is that Wertsch's book, written much more recently, covers alcoholism and abuse much more in depth. If you read this book and enjoyed it, I would highly recommend Truscott's."
5,A must read for anyone raised in the military.,"If you were raised in the military, this book will bring back memories you didn't realize you had. It also puts into focus that life you lived and why you became who you are. After reading this book, I fully understood who I was and how I got there, consequently making me a more centered person."
4,Military Brats by Mary Edwards Wertsch,Military Brats by Mary Edwards WertschThis book is a great study on internal family dynamics. It explains the major forces at work when ridged external pressure becomes the major factor on how a family behaves. It can be very helpful for the children of such a family to come to terms with what can be a very difficult childhood. The book was highly recommended to me by a doctor of psychiatry and I agree with her comments.
4,We Are Not Alone,"With a nice introduction by the best known Military Brat, Pat Conroy, this is valuable book even with its flaws. At a time in our country's history when the voters will elect a man who openly hates the military, and then elect another man who won't put his hand over his heart for the playing of the national anthem, it's easy for us who were born inside the fortress to feel out of place. This book explains why. And if you ever regretted seeing your father return from his foreign adventures, you are not alone; there are millions of us. This book covers that as well. Not as well as Pat Conroy did in The Great Santini, but there is only one Pat Conroy."
5,Monumentally important,"This book is monumentally important for those wishing to be more self aware and conscious about factors contributing to identity. It is monumentally important not only for military brats themselves but those who are beloved by military brats. It is monumentally important for the children of military brats and their children. The examples included in these anecdotes raise goosebumps of recognition and remembrance. I read this book a long time ago but will use it for my mother's (an Air Force widow) funeral service. I decided to use it when I learned today that as merely a widow, not a veteran, she is *not* entitled to a flag given 'on behalf of a grateful nation', even though she will be interned at my dad's veterans' grave site. As dark as some examples in this book might be for some readers, there is an overarching theme, of heroism, of love of country, and of valor, on the part of families."
2,Too much focus on the alcoholics and authoritatian,"If this book is representative of the military brats of the world, I can tell you that I am really blessed. While we did have discipline in our house, it was nothing like described in this book or in the ""Great Santini."" In fact, I can't remember knowing anyone in that situation.We did move a lot and I gained some insight to my wanderlust from this portion of the text. I do know why we never had pets, but didn't understand before."
4,Miliitary Brats highly recommended,"Although there are many books on this subject, this one was highly recommended by several friends and family who are/were ""Military Brats"" themselves."
4,Good NIght Moon,"Book was OK. Was advertised as LIKE NEW, when it was a little yellowed. was planning to give as a gift but could not."
3,Flawed but powerful,"Once you get past the typos (even in the downloaded errata), the lack of in depth examples, and the missing pieces, this book is actually a lifesaver. My problem with it, is that if you are new to Perl, or even new to Perl on Win32, you're going to be maddened by the fact that, out the box, hardly any of this stuff works. Once you get it working, it's amazing - the scheduled ""stub"" scripts literally do 80% of my job now, but getting there was painful.... I would have liked a) many, many, more examples b) no stupid errors (WindowsNT compared to Windows NT in a registry editing script, when the correct version was two lines above? I don't think so). If you have more than 10 NT workstations to manage and they need to be updated or changed, even in minor ways, on a regular basis, this book (along with the ORA ZAK book) will do it."
4,"Handy, compact and full of useful information","Bought this book for the local library and it goes out all the time. I have used it myself for numerous walking tours. It provides useful maps, and plenty of (accurate) information about the towns. Just what you need for a nice afternoon walking trip."
4,Great for this beginner!,"I wanted to try making cards as a hobby, but didn't really have the inspiration to do it on my own. I am so happy with book so far. I've made four cards with tricks learned from the book, two of which were cards that are actually in the book. The instruction is easy to understand, the pictures are wonderful and really help spark the creativity."
3,Not thrilled,"I wasn't particlarly ""wowed"" by this book. The cards seem kind of blah to me. There were very few that I would be inspired to actually take the time to make. Not too impressed!"
5,Flower Ring- Love It!!,"I received this item a day before the earliest suggested date, which was an excellent surprise. The ring is exactly as it is in the picture, both beautiful and sturdy and it fit perfectly. I highly reccomend this ring to anyone interested. Thank you!!!"
3,Not the same Jester footbags,"I recently got back into kicking footbags around again. After wearing out an old leather one I bought back in 2000, it was time to invest in some new footbags.I remember that Jester and Sandmaster being two of the top brands for non-tourney grade footbags.Both of these brands have fallen by the wayside in quality, with Sandmaster being only slightly better than Jester.The stitching on the Jester footbag is loose, with plenty of gap space for the sand grains to leak out of. I do not see the lifespan of this footbag living for more than a month or two at the rate that I play with friends.Sandmaster footbags do have tighter stitching, but the tie offs for the end of the thread are horrible and come undone and begin to lose sand.After some searching online, I did however find an excellent brand of footbag, Dragonfly, that is not sold on Amazon.com."
5,2003 Grammy Award Winning Album!!!!!,"The fusion of Tango Music and Techno does create a nice Chill Out Vibe. I purchased this CD down in Buenos Aires at the end of August 2003 and this album was still in the Top 30 Sales Chart. Not bad for a CD almost a year old. But don't take my word on how great this CD is (strongest tracks are #3 and #12), this CD was just recently the recipient of the 2003 Latin Grammy Awards for Best Pop Instrumental. I am a little surprised that Amazon does not flag award-winning albums in their search but should do so in the future! Give this album a try--you won't be disappointed!"
2,"Show me the money, preferably in pounds...","Seems like these guys really like British techno, the problem is that the ""electronica"" part of this record sounds dated. It seems like the money they should've spent on good equipment was spent on marketing. On top of that, the tango samples lost their depth and seem flat and one-dimensional. Buy Gotan instead, or even better, buy Narcotango by Carlos Libedinsky!"
1,Let's sell world music to the masses!!!,"Back in the late 1920s, a tango pioneer by the name of Julio De Caro turned what was a simple, provincial folkloric rhythm into a sophisticated, classical rooted musical style. After him, many more followed with their own talent.I guess it's a good thing that De Caro died 30 years ago, so he didn't get to hear this crap.""World music"" audiences will consume anything with an electronic bass & drums base track. Add a didgeridoo, and it's Australian. Add a bandoneon instead, and it's Argentinean. Needless to mention, talent is not required.But what can we expect when the alternative to this so-called world music is hip hop? Is it an alternative at all?"
1,Rubbish,"I agree with the fellow who used the word Muzak to describe this nonsense. It has all the feel of elevator music made for a business park in suburban Buenos Aires. In fact it made me rethink my feelings about the Gotan Project, which has one or two good cuts to its credit with the rest of its output being similar drivel. Honestly, begin with Tango Zero Hour by Piazzola and you will never tolerate garbage like the Bajafondo Tango Club."
3,2-3 good pieces...,"The CD is not as great as others mention, at least not for me. I like 2-3 of the pieces but that's it."
4,wonderful CD!!,"this is a great CD -- i would rate it 4.5 stars. i was expecting more upbeat songs like track #2, but it is a great CD to lounge with.the beats are awesome, and very well put together tracks."
4,Seated tango,"This is not dancing music, so much as it is relaxed music. It doesn't purport itself as some new club-ready album, but as a new way to enjoy this type of music. It is an equal blend of tango and trance, quite nice for driving. I find some of the end to be sort of repetitive or perhaps a better way to put it is indistinct. It is an album worth having if you enjoy tango music and wouldn't be put off by it not being in its full intensity. This is the latin album I listen to on long winter drives."
5,Music for Passionate Soulmate Lovers that understand Spanish!,"Like I sayed, it is nice music to hear at home with your passionate soulmate lover and friend, that understand spanish!Or just with friends at home hanging out!"
4,"This is chill out, not tango","If you are looking for traditional tango, or you expect some kind of modern tango like Piazzola, don't buy this CD. This CD is electronic and interesting music, and i enjoy it a lot. I Strongly recommend this CD for people who likes electronic neither dancing nor meditation music. Moreover, i recommend to start with ""La Revancha del Tango"" from Gotan Project to listen how chill out tango sounds."
2,Too much talk about this record,"I don't understand all the buzz about this record. Maybe is that everything that comes out from Santaolalla's factory always is well received by the record industry (he is part of it, in fact). Basically, Bajofondo is electronic stuff with some tango hints, but i dont think you can call it ""tango"" at all. One of the most important things on tango is the lyrics and you can not found (or even listen to) any single lyric here. And for the electronic side, there are many other artists that build a better relationship between genres. Karsh Kale for example, or Natacha Atlas, who can keep it natural, let say, as a way of express something that is there and not as an intelectual (and commercial) excercise."
5,Fantastico!,"This group is absolutely FANTASTIC, I love their most recent CD MAR DULCE, so decided to purchase their previous one. It has a bit more techno than accordion (which I love) but it has not disappointed me at all ! It is worth every penny.Highly RECOMENDED!Enjoy!Disfrutenlo!"
2,Candy Striper Pink not Meant for Women in their 40's,I love the fit of the Cotton Poplin Dress. BUT...I was surprised at the color! From the picture the color appeared more subdued...the actual color is more cotton candyish. This is the first item that I have been disappointed in that it was not a complete and truthful discription of the product. Even the picture implies a relaxing atmosphere versus an overaged Candy Striper!
2,"Nice Looking, But Not Practical","Once this was installed, we realized the holder for the shower head doesn't tilt. The holder (hook) can only be adjusted up and down. This was installed with a Kohler personal shower, so it wasn't that we were mixing an matching brands. It was installed as the the main(only)shower headAs a result, when the shower head was hanging on the bar, it would spray all the way across the shower. Couldn't be adjusted to spray down towards the person showering.I'd avoid this item unless it will be used with for secondary shower head, in addition to a regular shower head on the wall or ceiling."
2,Not high quality you would expect from,"I have the rowenta iron and its great so i thought this scale would be as good. It is not. I thought it would be heavy duty but its pretty tinny. The scale is not mechanical, its electronic. Runs on 2 AA batteries (not included i might add...). When you step on it calibrates for up to 5 seconds and then the scale needle lights up and moves to the weight. Cool the first time, annoying the 2nd time - really annoying every time after that. The memory function seemed like a good idea but again, there is such a delay in waiting for the thing you wont use it. The digital readout is also too small and not backlit so you cant see it."
5,Highly recommend refilling HP photo printer ink,This kit works great refilling my HP photo printer! If you're new to refilling your ink cartridges the instructions that are included tell you step by step how to do it. It saves money in having to replace cartidges which allows for quilt free color printing. The price of about $16.00 is even less than found on e-bay. This is a good product and a good price.
4,Unreal Tournament-better levels than PC,"If you have ever played Unreal or UT on PC, you AIN'T played nothin' yet. The levels are much better designed, if not smaller. The gameplay is the same, good ol kill or be killed. While this may seem like it may get boring, all you have to do is defeat a few maps of one type and you unlock the next type of gameplay. My favorite is Domination in which there are 3 specific points on the map which you have to control to win. The longer you hold those points the more points you accumulate and eventually win. I must say that although this is a very good game, there is really no replay value. Let's face it, no one buys a game just to play through it once and put it away. I have defeated all levels and all Challenges and I have done just that, put it away. I pull it out everyone once in awhile, when I'm bored, just to kill, maim, and desecrate the AI opponents, other than that it has become just another game in my library."
5,ONE OF THE BEST GAMES FOR DREAMCAST,"You can find this game for about 10 dollars now, and its one of the best, and most entertaining games on Dreamcast. It has provided me hours upon hours of entertainment, and i'm still not tired of it. There are so many weapons like the Chainsaw, Minigun, Pulse Gun, and more. It does get a little bloody, but if your alright with that it wont matter.Here are some Cheat codes for the game. You hit Pause while you are in a game, put this in with your control pad, and unpause.INFINITE AMMO:Left, Right, Left, Right, Right, LeftIMMORTALITY:Left, Left, Right, Right, Down, UpREPLENISH HEALTH:Down, Down, Down, Left, Up, RightHope this was helpful!"
5,Best Of The Dreamcast,"This Game is the only reason I still have a Dreamcast, It's 2009 and I can still play this for hours"
2,If it would only work...,"There's a few reasons why I only give this 2 stars: First, IT WON'T LOAD ON FIRST TRY! It actually takes a few tries; the Dreamcast won't recognise it as a DC game most tries. This is a big problem, and from what I hear from other players online, it happens to all of them.Next, it freezes quite a bit, on- or off-line, and sometimes loss of VMU data comes with that.The frame-rate isn't that great, but it's playable. And the online servers go from working fine to INCREADABLE lag, even with a broadband adapter. The PC version is WONDERFUL; and I think you can get some fun out of this version, but I really suggest renting this one before you think of buying. You will see all the problems right off."
4,More fur please,"Nice piece, good fast delivery. My only negative was that the dog looks more like a Laborador Retriever than a nice BIG NEWF."
5,INCREDIBLE!,"Certainly the best new author I've read in a long time! I couldn't leave the book, started reading it on Friday night and finished it the same weekend. It was like watching a movie. Miguel Santana's narrative style is fresh and imaginative. This novel will become a classic. I can't wait for his next book!"
5,Review- Cuando cantan los lagartos,"The thing that I liked about this novel was the way that it captured the bitter-sweet reality of life. If you are looking for a happy fairytale, it's not for you. But if you want to recognize life's traumas, and heartbreaks along with its good moments and re-experience them in a poignant, beautiful and very imaginative context you will love this novel. Think _Out of Africa_ or _The lover_, but with more of a sense of humor, and tongue-in-cheek approach to depicting human affairs and lost love. I was also impressed with the way that it played on Gabriel Garci'a Ma'rquez's magical realism (Cien Annos de soledad/A Hundred Years of Solitude)- a glimpse into this writer's ironic side."
3,Interesting.,"While this book covered things I had studied in the seventies, I did find it interesting. The back and forth of the two writers was different. The only fault I found with the book was the over use of quotes. Some I bookmarked though. I would recommend it to someone just getting into the study of becoming psychic."
2,I Concur with the Disappointed Ones,"I too am a fan of Nadja, that is what led me to this, as well as being a classical guitar lover. I've only played this three times, and that will be it.The music leaves me grasping for something else, anything else on my shelf. Certainly there are great musical talents here. Likely, they enjoy the challenge musically. But for the listener class such as we, we'll put our listening time and 5-star reviews with others.If this is representative of fusion, count me out."
5,Outrageously exciting,"We saw them live in 2nd row in San Francisco's Bimbo's club, a small and intimate setting; from up close the combination of Nadja's virtuoso play with the emotional intensity of her playing sent shivers down our spines. The interplay with the Assad brothers was very dynamic and balanced. The album captures the atmosphere of the live performance beautifully."
5,The Best,"This is the best album of the new milenium! Nadja Salerno-Sonnenberg and the Assads have made a beautiful, touching, romantic and inspiring record. All real Gypsy music, not the stuff you hear in a cheap restaruant, each track is rich and full of passion. This is an absolute must have! BUY THIS CD! and hear for yourself, you won't be sorry!"
5,Must-have for Shag fans!,"It would be a *sin* not to buy this datebook. There are a year's worth of Shag's wickedly delightful illustrations, perfect for framing in 2005. The ""On this day..."" calendar notes are hilarious--from Ozzy's birthday on December 3rd to Marilyn Monroe's first nude photography shoot (May 27th, 1949...When asked what she had on, she said 'the radio'). And there's still space for scheduling your own scandals!"
3,Not quite what I was expecting.,"This was a quick read with lots of action. The story was a little sci-fi which is not something I usually read, but getting out of my zone was good."
1,Disappointed,"I do enjoy the sour apple blow pops so I was excited to receive this package. First off, it did take some time for this package to arrive. Secondly, as I opened the first blow pop, it looked pretty old but I was expecting some to be in that condition. But basically every single one I opened so far, each one looked very old and not fresh. I am very disappointed that this company would send off the product in this kind of condition. I will never order from this seller again and very disappointed. Wish I could receive my money back but I know that will not happen. Save your money and purchase somewhere else."
1,Old lollipops. Don't waste your money.,"I usually buy my Charms lollipops at BJ's, but they only sell the assorted box. That is why I was willing to pay more for this product. When I received the package the box looked old. Like it had been setting around a warehouse for some time. I decided to try one and regretted it. The lollipops are way past their ""freshness"" date. They are nasty. Don't waste your money purchasing from this seller. I wish I would have read the reviews before I spent my money. I requested a refund. I think I'll stick to buying them at BJ's where the lollipops look and taste fresh."
5,Works great,"Nothing exciting to report. They work as described. No lint, fibers, etc. I like that I can pull out a pad without screwing up wet nail polish."
1,worst product ever!,"I received a free sample of these with purchase of some opi nail polish. These wipes are just the worst. When you try to place polish remover upon one, they are not absorbent, like cotton pads, so the chemical gets all over your hands.They are terrible at removing polish as they can't hold hardly any chemical. If you want to see what these are like, cut a 1x1 square of paper and try to use it with polish remover on your nails. Not too effective-really-I'd rather have some lint.Obviously, I would never buy these and will be tossing them into the trash-too bad."
5,Exactly what I needed!,"I have the Gelish system and these work perfectly for it! No lint, weird streaks, nothing! I use two for each Gelish application, but you could use one and get away with it, to make them last longer."
3,IT WORKS,I was slightly disappointed with this product - Ususally OPI is amazing but these wipes are not their best product. They work well but only for one nail at a time per sheet. You can't use them for more than one swipe before they start to break down.
1,very unahppy,"I am very disappointed and unhappy that yet again, from the make-up mall i have yet again not received my items ordered! I cannot review an item that i have never received!!!!!!DONT ORDER OPI EXPERT TOUGH NAIL WIPES AS YOU WILL NEVER RECEIVE THE ITEM ORDERED!OPI Expert Tough Nail Wipes Lint-Free 200 Wipes"
1,Awful Product,"These wipes arrived and they were dry. Maybe I mis-understood the product description, but I thought they were wipes for removing nail polish. These were simply dried out cloths. Total disappointment."
2,Sophomoric essay gone awry,"The author has used an inherently intriguing aspect of the field of linguistics -- the oxymoron -- and has written an awful book about it. While the examples are all fine (though some do not technically belong), it it the author's own writing in betwixt the quotes that is unbearable. I expect better prose from my 5th grader. Not worth the time."
4,Good Fun & Great Resource,"Some books are just fun. You pick them up knowing it will put a smile on your face and you leave it down with that smile on your face.Oxymoronica (Is this a moronic title?) is one of those books.It is difficult to write a lengthy review about this book because it would basically entail repeating many of the wonderful quotes which the author has sourced (and he does source and credit them very well.)The oxymorons range through humor, the human condition, politics, advice and other concepts. I would encourage you to ignore the oxymoronic advice of George Bernard Shaw quoted in this book - ""Never take anybody's advice,"" and read this book.It is a genuine little gem"
4,If You Love Quotes and More - this is it,I love quotes and in this case the Author strings together not only quotes but meaning. It is a unique approach and worthwhile reading. He covers key topics and takes you on a ride of thought and language thats worth it.
2,Too much and not enough,"The author sure does think highly of his own lowly comments. Many of the entries in this tiny tome don't belong, leading me to to believe he doesn't understand his own subject. Off the top of my head I can think of many examples of worthy oxymoronic quotes that were omitted; a cursory examination reveals many more that should have been. This book is filled with emptiness."
2,Some witty saying but they are very few and far between,One has to dig through lots of rubble to find the very few nuggets. Not worth the effort. There is also the author's annoying mannerism of setting items on the page as though they were poetry.
3,A little more literature,"This book has a more unique viewpoint than most others of its type, which makes it a bit more interesting. It takes more thought to analyze the entries, so that it serves as a ""wake up"" medium for emphasis when it accompanies other thoughts that one wants to express."
4,Tells best that which it does not tell directly,"There is a more to this rather small book than meets the casual reader's minds-eye. Like a puddle no more then a finger deep over some mundane surface, it can - for those who permit their eyes to focus on distant things - reflect the passing clouds, the moon or the infinite vault of the heavens.By which I mean to say that this book is what you make it. Don't just read it. Instead, read each phrase, and then ask yourself the following questions: (1) What does it say, literally? (2) What does it say metaphorically? (3) Why is there a difference between these, and does that tell me something useful?And your answers to question three will probably be: somethings it does, sometimes it doesn't, but it always makes me think a little, in a new way, about common but important things.I found it fun to read, and perhaps even quite useful in an amusing way. You will enjoy it."
3,game would be great if multiplayer worked right,this game is a good one only if you like playing single player.there have been so many problems with multiplayer that game is almost impossible to play against anyone else.if you go to the aceuplink site you will see all the post about the multiplayer problems.despite all the post and emails to gabriel and infogrames they have done nothing to fix mutliplyer.its been over 3 months and still there is no fix for the MP problems.it looks like the makers of the game are giving up on RA2.nothing is being said about a fix and now the offical RA2 site is closed.playing single player is all played out and game is not fun unless we can play MP.if multiplayer problems are fixed game would be great.
1,Windows killer,"I downloaded and played the demo on my Windows XP box. After 30 minutes it expires and took my sound devide with it. I should have known better when it said it wanted me to install DirectX 8.1 (as of this writing the current directX is 9.0.x).For a marginally interesting game it's not worth the damage that resulted. BTW, I had to uninstall my sound device and let plug and play find it again to get sound back on my PC.Buyer beware."
5,Fantastic Methodology,This book combined with Joe's on-line training website is thebest set of tools for the serious mountain biker- bar none. A comprehensive and incredibly useful set of information sure to improve anyone's skill.
2,A Mistitled Book,"I recently began biking in order to add some variety along side my primary activity which is swimming. I bought this book in order to learn something about mountain biking. If that is also your reason for buying this book then look elsewhere. Despite it's title this book has very little direct contact with mountainbiking. It has zero instruction on technique.I think that the major problem is that the book is mistitled. This is a very well written book on periodized training for the endurance athlete. What Mr. Friel writes is applicable to any endurance sport and most of the text is not specific to mountain biking. It is also directed towards the very serious and experienced athlete.In conclusion: this is an excellent book on periodized training, both theory and practice. If that is what you are looking for then buy this book. If you want to learn about mountainbiking - look elsewhere."
4,The Bible,"If you can't afford a trainer, and have the patience to put together a whole season of training on your own, this will help tremendously.More info on types of workouts would be helpful, as well as single speed specific stuff."
3,not the bible,"I think the author is a big pot smoker or something. His book is redundant and his thoughts are organized in a random long winded order. This book actually his first book Road Cyclists Training Bible with some of the phrases changed. He didn't even bother to to change the pictures to mountain bikes from road. I liked the section on overtraining and the importance of rest and recovery. Also liked the section on planning the whole for the whole race season with planned peaks at critical races. I feel like the guy should go back and rewrite the book and get rid of all of the charts and daily records, dairies and work on getting things more user friendly and coherent... lay down the pipe when you write this one dude."
3,redundant and disorganized,"Yah I think the guy writing this is probably a weed hound or something. His thought process is random, although detailed. I found that calling this the bible of mountain biking training is a joke, a bad joke. This author first wrote the Road Cyclists Training Bible and then changed a few sentences to adabt it to mountain biking. Some of the pictures he didn't even bother to change into mountain bikes from road bikes. Their are however some good sections of the book for me and they are: sections & theme on overtraining and the value of rest and recovery; the section on planning the whole year into sections for training and planned peaks around critical races. The bible it isn't, but there are some valuable sections."
3,Larges are VERY LARGE!!!,"Buying on the internet is confusing. I have several old pairs of Vanity Fair panties (different style) size 8 (large) but these new ones are HUGE and much bigger than my old ones. From waist to crotch these are 2"" bigger (old 13"" new ones 15""). The side seem increased from 8"" to 10"" and the waist (not streched) from 26"" to 28"". Other than the size issue, the panties are very nice."
5,a proccess of self discovery....,"This book is solid, allowing the reader to have a thorough review of him or herself. However, it is not a ""self test"" book while contemporary tests in it. It explains the concept of becoming a person like how a car works (metaphorically speaking). Highly recommended by anyone with a strong interest in psychology."
2,On Becoming a Person,Well I found it boring...I finally used it to hold up a fan. If you are a Carl Rogers fan then read it if not it is dry and dull
5,helps you understand ...,"I read this years and years ago. It helped me understand what I was doing and how I could think about it. So if you are a bit confused about your place in life and how to go about it, this is worth a read. That's all - it might just change your life."
4,Psychophilosophy,"Rogers writes this book on what seems to be an unsure basis about his theories on human psychology which i find to be very accurate, albeit ignored theories. From Socrates, Descartes, and Sartes his theories, though accidental, seem to come from. The evolution of the human being, the mystique of free will, and the pattern of thought are all described in this book"
2,"Visually Pleasing, Cartographically Wanting","Very nice appearance and many features, but it has consistently failed my wife and I for helping us find our way around. It is not as detailed as the AAA atlas in such matters as exits and rest stops, and we even got lost one time due to this lack. We will never buy this one again and will throw it away as soon as we buy a different atlas we think we can trust."
1,review of moist heat neck wrap,"I purchased the item as a gift for christmas at my friend's request. she just phoned me and told me the item is not good. she stated the velcro does not stick. she asked me to return it. therefore, although i did not have direct use of this item, I now have to return it. I would not recommend it as it does not do what it promises."
5,Very Nice Heat Warming Neck Wrap!,"This heat wrap is very helpful in calming down my fatigued mussels in my neck, I love how I can wear it and walk any place I want to and not worry about it falling off, Because I have other hot packs but they do not attach to anything and therfore they fall off. So the Velcro is really really nice. After working at the computer all day I will wear it or even while working. It is really great. I put in into my microwave and warm it up and it stays warm for a good 20 to 30 minutes. It may not fix my neck problems I have, but it sure is a wonderful tool to use to help get me through, and help me continue working throughout the day. So Big Thanks go out to those who made it!"
1,It wasn't what I expected.,The neck wrap had an odor that my daughter didn't like. I think it was lavender but it was not pleasant.
3,Beware of zipper,"This moist heat neck wrap provided the moist heat I needed. I am not ecstatic about the aroma therapy, but it was an added benefit.The zipper is metal, so you must assure that it is not out in the open when you heat the wrap in the microwave."
2,Not quite there,"It's a good approach but construction quality didn't satisfy my needs. The beads bags kept shifting around to my throat instead of back of the neck. Sewn seams on the bags failed, leaking beads. When the zipper broke, I gave up and tossed it."
2,"Great heat, terrible aroma","I was really disappointed with this wrap. First, the heat is not even because the wrap contains several small pouches to distribute the heat. Most disappointing is the terrible scent from the aroma beads they put in it. I used it for 10 minutes and felt nauseated......."
2,Unacceeptable,"I dislike that it heats unevenly and it is not as full as I would like. I would like to return it if possible, but I have used it before realizing it is not as I expected !!"
4,Ono!,"Ono is the name of the big dog in the story and the name by which my son refers to the book. Ever since it arrived, he's asked nearly daily for me to read it to him. I'm not sure that it's helped with his fears, but it certainly aids in the discussion of worries and fears, how we all have them and how we can adjust our thinking to overcome them."
4,Fun and Silly,"My girls love this book. They can relate to the fears this little girl has, and they love the ways she deals with those fears - especially the eyeball song. Great book!"
5,Lesson Learned,This book helps children learn a lesson of how to face your fears. It also shows them that often the things they are afraid of are just silly harmless things or an animal that is more afraid of them. It is also a fun and silly book that kids love!
1,Cute but disappointing,"This brief little book is quite attractive, but too brief and simplified to be of use in any actual wedding planning. If you're looking for actual explanations on proper etiquette for wedding and reception, this one will not provide the answers."
5,Nowhere is a place,Bernice McFadden is a wonderful author. She did an outstanding job with this storyline.
3,Enjoyed The Journey!,McFadden has become one of my favorite writers. I believe I've read all of her novels and can't say a bad thing about any of them. A great read here. I didn't even figure out who Dumpling was until the end.
5,This was my first McFadden book and it won't be my last...,"I can't wait to read all of her other books, now I'm a fan. This book was chosen as a main selection from my book club, I had no idea what it was about when I started reading it but I quickly fell in love with the characters and couldn't stop reading. McFadden's fictional story felt real, the story reminded me of a book I read a couple of years ago ""Child of God"" by Lolita Files. Both stories walk though a family's history and end in the present where all issues are brought to light and at some point forgiven and resolved. A great story, read it in only two days! Read It! Buy It!"
3,Not Straightforwd,"This novel has alot of flashbacks and symbolism. It is an ok read if you can figure it out. Otherwise, it is confusing and has alot of pointless material in it. I like more straightforward reads."
2,"Good watch, TERRIBLE strap.","I had this watch for about four months before both the top and bottom straps started separating from the face. I could still wear it, so I did, until another problem arose: the strap got a big crack in it and eventually broke. All because of normal wear; I'm not that abusive. I thought perhaps it was just that one watch until I sent it in to nike, which returned me a brand new watch for $12, on which the straps began separating from the face AGAIN. One day the strap finally separated completely from the face, so I can't wear it anymore. Now I can tell the problem is that the rod connecting the strap to the face is held in on the ends by cheap plastic that breaks easily, allowing the rod to bend and eventually snap. I loved this watch (both of them actually), but I'm moving on to a watch with a strap that wraps around the face."
2,Alarm not loud enough,"I bought this watch to do interval training. However, the alarm is so quiet that when I am running I can't hear it, so I might as well just be looking at my wrist every 2 seconds and using a regular watch."
3,Love watch but band is bad,I bought this watch because of the sleek look. I have my watch on all the time and did not want it to look like a bumpy sports watch. I am in the water a lot and the glue/conection of the band to the face became separated after owning it about 6 months. I am thinking I should have gotten a bit more for my money and the product name.
3,Easy to read!,"This is the easiest to read watch that I have ever owned! The time and date are very large and bold, great for those of us with less than perfect eyesightThe time was a little off, it gained about 5 minutes in 6 month's time. Also, the band is plastic, so no surprise when it broke after 18 months, the problem is that there is no way to replace the band.I really liked the style, and with the easy to read face, I am considering purchasing another one in spite of the short comings."
4,Nike Imara Run Watch,"Works great! I just started running and needed a watch to time walk/run intervals. Just wish it were a little smaller. I have very small wrists and it's a little bulky. Although I wanted pink, I'm happy I went with the black. It's very classy looking and nice enough to wear to work. Very happy with my purchase and would definitely recommend it!"
3,Nike Watch ok for a while,"Bought this for a present for my daughter 2 years ago or less. The recently broke, it was good watch while it lasted. I felt like the band should not have broken so soon. The price was right so I guess you get what you pay for."
4,Nike Women's Imara Run Watch,"The watch was delivered in a very timely manner, but there was no invoice or paperwork when delivered."
2,sergeants sniffers,"i have tried these but my dog doesnt favorite them,i still have the bag and bought him stuff he preffers over this one"
4,Good short guide,"This is a good short guide to mental status and how to evaluate. I am in a Speech-Language Pathology graduate program that uses this to evaluate stroke, TBI, and other neuro patients. The reminder card in the back of the book is a nice addition, too! I gave it four stars because it is a little disorganized and somewhat tedious to read, but it is a useful book."
2,Game hardly worthy of PS2 launch,"If you own Virtual Pool (1 or 2), you will be greatly disappointed in this game. It just doesn't have a convincing look-and-feel of playing a real pool game. It certainly doesn't exercise the graphics capabilities of the PS2 in any signficant manner. The controls are unintiutive and imprecise. The only saving grace in this game is the somewhat interesting ""puzzle"" mode which provides 25 interesting table designs.But for standard pool play, it is pretty weak. Get Virtual Pool for PS1 if you really want a pool game for your PS2."
1,bad game,"Well, I rented this game after looking at all these great reviews. I don't understand why this game is getting such good reviews from everyone else. It's horrible. Music = bad. Control = bad. If you want to buy a real game, buy Virtual Pool 2 for your PC... it's much, much better. Skip out on this one. Or do what I did, rent it and find out for yourself."
3,DO NOT BUY,"I have the newest PS3 system and purchased this game, assuming I could play ANY Playstation game on the newest system. WRONG! DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! It is NOT compatible with a PS3 system because the back of the game CD is purple and the newest system cannot read it."
1,This book is bad,This is my first book about salts and I could not understand what the book was telling me because it apparently references another previous book which I do not have.
5,Excellent Price Guide,This book is essential for the salt cellar (open salt) collector. It must be used in conjunction with 5000 Open Salts : A Collector's Guide. The former gives the price range of each open salt. The latter provides a photograph and description of each individual salt.
2,Not helpful at all if you don't have the main book,"I think it was kind of silly to put the values in a separate book. I have both books, but its a pain to look up values."
1,Book Review,"This book is extremely boring, dry, and mundane. It does not hold the interest of the reader and it will more than likely put you to sleep after the first several pages. I do not recommend this for literary students, or anyone else for that matter!! Save your money!"
3,Not as easy as you would think,"I was excited to purchase this item as I work a lot with fondant, and my handwriting is less than stellar; so an opportunity to provide nice lettering on cakes was welcome.However, I make my own fondant and it did not work well in these molds - it stuck, no matter what I did (using cornstarch in the molds as directed, refrigerate, freeze, let sit overnight). I did not try using the store-bought Wilton fondant, so don't know if that is what would make the difference.That said, I noticed they were made of the same materials as Wilton's candy molds, so tried using candy melts in them instead. Viola! Perfect letters! I even did two-tone white and pink and they turned out lovely, popping out of the molds with ease and giving me nice lettering for the birthday cake I was working on.So - I was disappointed in their performance with fondant, but thrilled with how they handled candy melts."
1,One color only =0( false advertiseent!,"I bought this in the store, because on the packaging the letters looked awesome. It is impossible to use two colors and make it look nice. One color fondant letters look nice, but very tedious work to cut them out with an exacto knife.if you have these, powdered sugar works best to help release it. The instructions say corn starch, but it doesn't work! =0PThere are better letter molds out there!"
2,Save your money!,"I was so excited to try these out for my daughter's birthday cake. But, as another reviewer mentioned, this is a tedious process! It is hard to remove the letters from the mold and way too time consuming to sit there and use 2 tone color. After an hour of trying to do one letter to my satisfaction, I gave up and just did the entire letter the same color. However, I am glad for the suggestion on here to use them as candy melt molds! I think that would work far better!"
2,"Nice end result, but very tedious.","I used this product with Wilton pre-made fondant and did not find it to be worth the price. The molds are thin plastic and will not hold up to repeated use. In fact, one of them broke after placing it in the freezer to remove the letter (as directed). This turned out to be a very time-consuming and tedious process. It took several hours to make the letters I needed for my cake (14 in total). Pressing both colors into the same mold was not easy at all and took a lot of patience. It was also quite difficult to get the letters out of the molds, even after dusting the molds with cornstarch as directed. In the end, the letters looked very nice and added visual appeal to the cake, but if I ever use this again, I will make the letters well in advance and do only a few at a time."
1,"Bad batteries and expensive to replace, quit working after four years","I purchased this scale in Feb. 2002. It was great while it lasted. The display started showing ERR, and then went dead. I had to search for a new battery, a special lithium one which cost $12.00 and had to be ordered by a store that specializes in batteries. The scale is now dead again. I don't know if needs another new battery or if the scale has just quit functioning.When compared to other scales, this is not an inexpensive model. The information offered says the original battery should last for five years. It did not. I have replaced it once, and now need a replacement or a new scale. Something this expensive should last. I purchased this item based on the Rowenta name and very disappointed.It looks great and is accurate, but will it continue to work? Mine didn't"
1,"Great while it lasts, but it doesn't last","For the first six months I owned this scale, I could have written a 5-star review. Then I started getting lighter and lighter. At first I was pleased, but I kept getting still lighter and lighter until my weight loss was so dramatic I couldn't believe it. I checked myself on a friend's scale and hadn't lost a pound -- the only thing that had changed was this scale's accuracy. Like others, I ordered an expensive replacement battery and saw absolutely no improvement. The scale itself is the problem.Now it says I weigh half of what I really do. If this keeps up I can fly away..."
3,OK,"I was excited to get this shirt but after it arrived I didn't like the quality or the fit. I rarely wear it and I am thinking of giving it away to a friend. Still in really good condition, I've probably only worn it once. It shipped on time and everything, just don't like the shirt."
3,Left a bad taste in my mouth . . .,"I am sorry to say I didn't like this book. I couldn't wait to get it because my boyfriend also was in the service in the 50s and we wrote to each other every day. I enjoyed the first part of the book and all of the ""interpretations"" given by Carole (his wife), but Chris himself was (even for a young man/boy in the 1950s) egocentric to the point of being boorish. I don't remember exactly when Atlas Shrugged was written, but Chris (the author of these letters) sure had Ayn Rand's philosophy of selfishness. Imagine a man telling his wife he slept with prostitutes because his ""sexual urge was just like my urge to eat or to scratch an itch"" and he HAD to satisfy it . . . expecting her to believe that, YET telling her if she slept with anyone else he would kill himself. Ugh. I just didn't like Chris. Also, he wrote in his letters how he was DRIVEN to write . . . but we never find out if he ever WROTE anything of significance again. Very disappointing."
2,Relatively uninteresting compilation of man's letters,"A man in the Army writes home to his wife, constantly telling her to write to him. He is very self-involved and constantly begs her to tell him how much she loves him with no real feeling for the fact that she is home pregnant with his child. He pays little attention to where he is and spends his free time with prostitutes and complaining about others making too much noise. Gives very little information about much except himself."
5,CAN-CAN,"For can-can enthusiasts, this film contains two EXCEPTIONAL can-can numbers in full costume (including traditional suspender stockings and frilled underwear)...."
2,"Be careful, or your face will stick like that.","This is a surprisingly lurid little shocker (for 1959), with a clever plot and some nice ideas. It just takes a smidgen too long to get where it's going, although the ending is fine.Due to the title and cover art, it is not revealing too much to say that Karloff becomes a killer, one with a rather scrunched-up face. These contortions seem appropriately gruesome at first, yet ultimately distract from the film. For one thing, for the movie to have us believe that these meager facial alterations would make him totally unrecognizable to those around him is asking a bit much.Still, some strongly dark atmosphere and intriguing storytelling are present. Probably worth a half-star more, but the bad slightly outweighs the good."
3,"Good looks, but not for the long haul","I've owned a couple of these watches, as I like the looks and size. But I recently went to have the batteries replaced and was unhappy to find that the watches actually need repair, after just 2 years of use. It seems to me that just basic, regular use should not cause a Bulova watch to conk out. The warranty is only for one year. Disappointing, and doesn't match my earlier experience with Bulova."
3,the case for the kantana,The case does a great job at protecting the phone.The only problem that i see is that the case prohibits the charger from a good connection to the phone which causes insufficient charging sometimes.
3,Warning on Case for Katana,"The case looks good, fits snugly, and the belt clip works well. BUT:1 - There is no hole in the back for the speaker outlet, so the ""speaker phone"" function is muffled (I had to cut my own opening with fingernail scissors); and2 - The elastic straps that hold the case to the phone are oversized, and partially cover the charging port and the port for the hands-free adapter.When you get the case, be ready to do some trimming with small scissors or a razor to uncover the two ports."
1,Poor Academic Work,"This book would be very appealing to the Unitarian perspective. However, it is not an academic read. One God One Lord presents the views of the authors well but tends to be repetitive and more philosophical than Biblical. If its a good theological read your looking for--I suggest finding something else."
5,CORRECTING AN ERROR,"Hello,I made an error concerning my reveiw of the book. I said that this book proves that Jesus didn't have a virgin birth and that Joseph was the biological father. That's an error. Sorry for the inconvenience.Thank you."
3,what is with the front cover of the jacket,Is it me or is there something vulger with the girl(the way she is positioned) on the front cover. If other people see it another way pls post.I'm a fan of psychological suspense but this book went too slow. And for Lauren to look at Delaware (only after two sessions) as a role model is hard to swallow. My favorite is still Billy Straight.
1,Flesh and Boring!,"This is absolutely one of the worst books I have read this year. I can't believe I wasted my money on it! The plot line is awful, and the story has way to many characters. You really don't like any of them, and can't wait for the next one to get murdered. The ending was vey predictable. Don't waste your money on this one."
2,Done to death!,"Kellerman has become too complacent in developing this series character, and the book just rambles on as if the reader is supposed to fill in the blanks. There are no twists, which by definition is what makes something a THRILLER. This was not thrilling at all . . . Kellerman has fallen victim to the growing trend among successful authors to just phone in tired tales to their large reading audience. The plot is a bad episode of ""Barretta"" at best or some T.V movie of the week at worst. The characters show up and deliver lines that are right of a high school production and you skip around so much trying to find some meat that you lose track of the story. Perhaps Kellerman is tired of this genre, because his main character seems to be just going through the motions as well. It's been a long time since this series was exciting . . ."
1,Painful to read and idiotic!,"In real life, detectives have to track down every possible lead and interview everyone with the slightest possible information about their case. Most of it amounts to nothing...which is why we read thrillers.Unfortunately, Kellerman takes us along on all the useless interviews and dead ends while protagonist Alex Delaware uses psychobabble to speculate about possible motives. And whenever the investigation stalls, Delaware decides to jump in his car and go for a ride ""to clear his head"" -and amazingly stumbles upon a hot new lead each time!Overwritten and tiresome, FLESH AND BLOOD will try your patience. For a truly taut and exciting thriller, I strongly recommend PURSUIT by Thomas Perry."
3,A nifty psychological thriller,"Dr. Alex Delaware takes on a case almost by himself in this novel, his 15th outing, by Jonathan Kellerman. Dr. Delaware treats antisocial personality Lauren Teague briefly and then only notices her again when she's the entertainment at a bachelor party he attends. Later, she is discovered dead and Dr. Delaware's guilt causes him to try and find her killer. In Kellerman's hands, sunny L.A. has a dangerous, seedy side that contributes to Lauren's corruption and death and ties her to a case Milo Sturgis is trying to solve. Delaware makes bad decision in this book that jeopardize his friendship with Milo and his relationship with artist/luthier Robin, and it's refreshing to see an author whose characters have flaws and to see how those flaws affect other characters and occasionally carry over into other books. Highly recommended for thriller readers."
3,"A Fun, Quick Read","This book is a fun, quick read. It's nothing meaty but it is a typical book in the Alex Delaware series by Jonathon Kellerman.Alex Delaware, child psychologist turned private eye, gets involved in the search for the murderer of an ex-patient. His friend Milo, a gay police officer, also appears in this novel along with Alex's guitar-maker girlfriend.This is a good book for the beach or plane."
4,entertaining,"I'm not a big fan of detective novels or murder mysteries, but Jonathan Kellerman does a great job. He keeps the pages turning and I have fun trying to figure out ""who done it"". I really enjoyed this book and can't wait to read more in the Alex Delaware series."
4,Alex Delaware needs a shrink,"The main character in this book was not any of the victims, but Alex Delaware himself. He feels he has done an injustice to an old client and obsessively takes up her case. Lauren Teague was a trouble teen, one time hooker, finally turning her life around, and now she turns up dead. But her case is entangled with another girl's, Shawna Yeager, and Alex ""the bulldog"" just can't leave either one alone. And his obsession just might cost him his relationship also.I usually read multiple books, switching off, but this one I had to finish, and it kept me guessing, about both girls, and about Alex's relationship with his girlfriend Robin, right up to the last page."
1,Disappointing and predictable,This is the first time I read a book by Kellerman and it will also be the last. This book could have been written by an aspiring writer and they would have done a better job. It is highly predictable and 'staged'. The whole book is a collection of chance encounters and discoveries. Don't waste your time.
3,Not so bloody,"This is my first Jonathon Kellerman book and whilst it was a good read and kept me interested until the end, I feel unsatisfied. There was a lot of guesses gone wrong in the book and even the climax wasn't all that thrilling. Everything seemed to be tied up too perfectly at the end. I will most likely try another Kellerman book as I enjoyed Alex Delaware as a character, I just don't think I liked the case too much, or Alex's relationship with Robyn. As usual I should have probably started with book number 1 and worked my way through :)"
3,what is with the front cover of the jacket,"Is it me or is there something vulger with the girl(the way she is positioned) on the front cover. If other people see it another way pls post.I'm a psychological suspense fan, and I thought this book went too slow. And for Lauren to look at Delaware (only after two sessions) as a role model is hard to swallow. My favorite is still Billy Straight."
4,"Story great, tired of selfish women","I'll tell you honestly, I love the mystery/psychology side of Kellerman's books, but these selfish women that inhabit the lives of the major characters in all the books, just defy realism. Robin is so self centered, so needy, even with her own business, that it's a major sidetrack from the real story. I wish Kellerman would get over this ""woman"" thing and find Alex a gal that appreciates all he does. Women are not all like the Robin character. I've noticed that this seems to be the case with all mystery/psych writers. The women are so self centered and egotistical, that they're fighting for the limelight. It really gets disgusting. Most women support their partners. There's no support in a great number of these writers' novels by the ""modern day"" women. Other than that, the stories are great and I enjoy every one of them."
3,good for those interested in forensic science and psych,"A quick read with a pretty interesting mix of character development, plot twists, local color (L.A.), and perhaps best of all, police work and forensic psychology. The detective (Alex) is the character Kellerman uses throughout all his novels. This is the first Kellerman book I've read and would try him again for an escapist read. Excellent character development."
1,Flesh and Blood,"Kellerman's worst. Very trashy, no story, difficult to finish. Alex has become such an ace detective that soon they can do without Milo. Very disappointing compared to previous Kellerman novels."
3,Very Average,"After reading Monster and being pleasantly suprised, I was quickly disappointed with this very average book. The plot was a mess. I felt the book had way too many characters to follow and the characters were not that interesting. Also, I really never understood Alex's obbession with the deceased. I think, after reading two books, Kellerman is a good writer but is up and down like anyone."
4,BEAUTIFUL GIRLS DYING,"This is another DR.ALEX DELAWAREseries. Alex was a clinicalpsychologist who has retired fromseeing patients and now is aconsultant for the police dept. Heis called by the mother of a patient he had seen twice, ten years ago. Her daughter is missingbut the police are not taking anyaction so she wants Alex to findher. His friend Milo is a detectivewho makes the case official andasks Alex to help out. Call girlswho worked for the same woman arestarting to disappear as theconnection to Lauren starts toleak out. Their clients were allvery high paying business men whosenames have been protected by codes.Alex finally picks up a trail thatleads to a family determined tokeep names secret even if killingshave to be done.This book is a slower pacedread and has lots of deaths andpeople to keep track of but earnsa 3 1/2 to 4 star rating in myopinion...borrow it from thelibrary or a friend."
3,NOT HIS BEST WORK,I love the Alex Delaware series and have read every book. This one seemed to lack passion and motivation. Why is Alex so caught up in this mystery that he risks his relationship with his lover? Could he feel so guilty about his inability to help a client in two brief sessions some years ago that he was willing to take such risks with his life?The plot twists were good and the final outcome was very interesting but I just don't understand where Alex fit in the story.Will Milo never learn how to dress properly?
1,"Well, maybe next time..............","I have been a Kellerman fan for years. I love a series, but this time Alex Delaware is dull, needs to get a life and bring himself into 2002!He is so bored he is boring!Kellerman would do good to revamp Delaware's character so that he does not sound like all of the other characters in his book.More than reading, I would say I skimmed this book trying my best to find substance.Delaware has become a shadow of his former self and that is sad."
3,Back on track,"The author is back to doing what he does best, giving us characters to care about. A little too much analysis between Alex and Milo, but when the action begins, the wait is worth it. The series has regained its zip."
1,hard to finish type book,How ridiculous that this phycologist would spend that much time investigating a death of one of his patients from 10 years prior that he only saw 2 times. Was not realistic and once you got a flavor for the author could tell what he was up to. I was embarrased for the author....it seemed he thought the readers were uneducated and wouldn't mind that it was unreal. Don't waste your time or money
3,Not up to par,"The book's premise is a little hard to take seriously. It seems unlikely that Alex Delaware would behave in such an irrational, risky manner. There are too many peripheral characters to keep track of and the subplot seems to infringe on the real story. Definitely worth reading (what Kellerman book isn't?) but by the end you won't really care who did it and the conclusion isn't that logical anyway. I did enjoy the psychological analysis and therapy descriptions, but I'm in the field, so maybe it's not that interesting to someone who isn't."
1,Junk.,"First, the item came with a manual marked by the previous owner. That can be overlooked, but the grinder was horrible in its grinding ability. I may have just as well bought a blade grinder in that the grind was dust and chunks, no matter what setting I put it on.Horrible to say the least. I sent it back and purchased a new one, which I enjoy to this day."
4,cool,I bought it as a gift for a friend who collects skulls and she loved it. It was really cool looking. I will definitely buy from this seller more often.
5,The absolute best mask you can buy,"I read product reviews before any purchase, but until now, I had never left one. This mask is too good to be kept secret. My skin was oily until three years ago when I moved to the desert. Now it's combination, and that combination can change with the day of the week. This mask calms any redness, clears any oil WITHOUT drying, eliminates flakiness, minimizes blemishes and tightens your skin. When I touch my face after rinsing off this mask, it doesn't even feel like my face. My skin feels softer than after a facial. It's the best skin product I've ever purchased, and I've spent thousands trying to find it. Don't waste any more money! Go get it now!!"
2,It's PLASTIC covered in chrome,"For what it really is I think it is a fine price, I marked it down because they mislead you into thinking it might be metal by purposely saying Chrome in all descriptions except for the handle. I just don't liked being deceived."
2,plastic and cheap,"keeps spinning around and unloosening, can't do too tight as its plastic and will crack, had to pay a lot more for better quality one."
1,Do not get this!!!!,"When I tried to install this, it leaked. So I screwed a bit more, then it clacked. It a piece of garbage."
3,About the intricacies and spirals of all things,"I read ""Seeing Nature"" because I am a high school honors zoology and biology teacher, and was looking for something that would help me out in the classroom. If I hadn't had the intrinsic interest in nature already, I would have found the book somewhat boring. It certainly doesn't flow like nature books by Sue Hubbell, but there are some interesting parts. It has given me a different way to view the natural world - as a series of spirals and interconnectedness; as gradients, not edges."
2,uneven sizes,I was pretty disappointed when I received them since one boot was much narrower and smaller than the other one. I did not return it since the box was huge and heavy.....
3,Needs to be redesigned,"This coffeemaker is not very well designed; it is difficult to fill with water because the lid on top does not goes back far enough and the carafe is too big to pour into the too small an opening provided. The water level gauge is on the wrong side of the maker and is only effective if you are left-handed or able to fill the reservoir from the left side; I keep overfilling it due to the awkwardness of having to look under my arm to see the guage. Also the clock is worthless as it is nearly impossible to see, it should have been backlit or another color. I wonder if the designers ever try to use their products!!!"
4,Not too bad....,"I had been wanting a thermal carafe coffeemaker for quite awhile, but not wanting to spend a lot of money on one. I found this one and thought I would give it a try. Here's my experiences with it: Timewise, it brews about 1 Cup per minute. There is no leakage or overspill as some other models have. Coffee is hot and stays hot in carafe for a long time (have not done a timer test or anything lol). Programming feature very easy and works well. Now there is just one negative thing that I have found. It has one of those plastic mesh permanent filters that comes with it. When first purchased I ran a vinegar solution through it then plain water about 10 times and was still getting a not-so-good taste. I thought I would give it a try without the permanent filter and just using a paper one. That made all the difference in the world and made a tasty cup of coffee."
1,Disappointing,I've read dozens of end times novels and to me this one seems juvenile and very predictable. It portrays the Israeli Defense Force as villans and idiots. Try James Beauseigneur or Grant Jeffrey for thier excellent prophetic novels.
3,Definately NOT for kids!,There is stuff in here that could be considered offensive for people under 18. Please use caution when buying this for a gift!
1,Awful book,"In addition to being mostly inappropriate, these jokes aren't even funny. I can laugh at an off color joke but it needs to be humorous. Definitely a total waste of money and I made my son throw it away."
2,Humor Me,"The following is a review that I did not write. Due to some mammoth humor, or more likely, a burp in cyberspace, my name has become associated with it. I leave it posted for your consideration. Vicki""I read a review in a local paper about The Mammoth Book of Humor and thought that it would make a wonderful Christmas gift for my in-laws. The reviewer went into great detail about the hilarious section that lists typos and unintentional puns from actual newspaper headlines. Unfortunately, they failed to mention that the book also contains religious humor that is in poor taste and that many people will find offensive."""
3,So friggin' hard!!,"This is the most difficult game ever! I know the developers were most likely trying to reflect the difficulty for the American soldiers during this war, but still! You'll think you are perfectly safe when all of a sudden they will appear from nowhere behind you, and usually you are dead or close with one hit. They are also waaaay too smart. I'll be creeping along a ridge fifty feet above someone, poke my rifle over the edge,and before i can even aim at someone, they suddenly see me, as though i was running around yelling with Christmas lights strapped to my body. The weapons are really cool though, and the gameplay is fun regardless of how hard it is."
4,Jungle warfare - love it,"Just imagine, you're character being a special forces sniper. The atmosphere in this game is great. The map design, the music, and the ambient sounds really add something to the game. Creeping along some bushes bordering a path leading downhill, then suddenly you hear gunfire, not knowing where it comes from you immediately go prone. Finally, you see the tracers coming the bush next to you, you fire in that area, enemy down. Within a few minutes you come upon a outpost, what do you do? Go in guns blazing, or the smart thing, snipe the sentry gaurd from a long distance and then sneak in? I love this game, it's great. An excellent blend of graphics and gameplay, I must also mention the musical score really adds to the excitement and suspense of the game."
3,Good Sniper Game,"I have had this game for a while now and I am happy with it. If you like sniper games, this isn't bad. It isn't the best sniper game I've played, but it is good to play."
4,Fun,A kinda sorta almost outdated game which has a high gameplay factor. still worth five bucks or less. If ya like ww2/vietnam shooters it's a steal.
2,Too old to under stand,I guess I'm too old because I couldn't get the game working. I'll keep trying and who knows someday I might become a sniper.
1,Dissapointing,"I love the adventure travel genre, but this one doesn't make the grade. The book is the day-by-day diary of a round-the-world cyclist. Adventure? Excitement? Not!A typical day's entry reads something like: ""Left at 9:30 and rode xx Kms. to 'name of town'. Horrendous headwinds all day. Checked into a hotel -- can you believe they only have 2 satellite channels on the TV? No McDonald's in town so I went to the hotel restaurant and had a steak."" No kidding.After a bout of food-poisoning he takes a month off in Perth, Australia. This time period includes September 11, 2001. His jornal entry? ""Did nothing"".If you want adventure bike travels read something by Anne Mustoe instead."
1,Anything can be published....,"This is nothing more than a multipage advertisement for his other books. There is no advice on understanding or maintaining burners that he doesn't refer the reader to another of his books, and what's up with the incessant hot-tub analogies? His other books may be of more value for potters, but I won't buy any of them."
2,Burners Understanding Maintaining and Using Burners,From the title I was expecting a more technical book than what I received. Was looking more for designs and engineering rather than general information this book gives.
4,A book that still holds up,Early Words was my sons' favorite first book. I couldn't wait to give this to my two year old grandson. He loves the book as much as his father. He is already looking a the words printed next to the picture. The book holds its charm even after twenty-six years.
4,"Fred, truly a dog among dogs!","After The Chicago Tribune killed off ""Fred Basset"" for tripe that better fitted their demographics target, I was forced to read good old Fred from an internet subscription. (Older annuals are still available on eBay.) The 2004 Orion book is available from Amazon and Amazon Marketplace. Buy it now and buy the 2005 edition before it sells out. Unfortunately, the annual does not reprint the Sundays and not even all the year's worth of dailies. But, still a great collection!"
3,An ok book,This was an ok book. Not one of Stines best but it was kinda hard to put down cause i wanted to know what was going to happen.!!
1,Never received my product,I put I hated it because I never received my product and have to wait to get my refund.
2,Fear Street books are not that good.,All of these books are so similar that after you have read like 5 or six of them you have read them all. This series would have been better if he didn't write so many of them.
5,The Blood and Thunder Adventure on Hurricane Peak,"When I was a little kid, this was my very favourite book!! Margaret Mahy is a very talented writer, and this book was great for me to read over and over again. I also liked the pirates mixed up voyage, it was another of the books written in Margaret Mahy's collection - with a very unique writing style. I was about 8 when I actually sent Margaret Mahy a fan letter!! I got a long (two pages on a typewriter!) letter back from her, with hand drawn (and coloured in) cats all over the border of the letter! This book is adventurous, fun and has a very twisted plot with talking cats and distant cousins, and a school of Magic!!! I suggest it for any one looking for a good read - so long as they haven't let go of their ""INNER CHILD""!!!"
4,Wonderful stuff - great positive energy,"Just picked up this book for my dad for father's day. Of course, it was impossible not to dip in and sample some of the poems. They are really neat - touch a chord that resonates beautifully."
4,Great Modern Poetry,He work is very clear. The words transform the writers memories into the readers memories. I highly recommend My Dad's Wallet and Woolworths 1954.
2,Literacy Map Not Available,We did not receive this item but was informed by the seller (after inquiring) that this was no longer available. We have been advised a credit will be forthcoming by the seller.
4,"Review of the ""The New England Primer"".","The Foreword says ""This is the first textbook printed in America, and for a century it was the beginning textbook for students"", which shows, for a fact, that our forefathers used Biblical principles as guide for teaching and for moral absolutes. We would do well, to return to those truths in teaching today.The book is educational, religious, with historical literary homeschooling principles.I would recommend this as essential reading material for students and parents alike."
2,Size,"Was excited to get this book and was disappointed with the size. Not sure how it could be incorporated into someone's home school curriculum. Would have to take the ""lessons"" and enlarge."
3,Size does matter,For the costs this is a great book to open ones eyes to the past.With that said I think the average person that buys this book because the really want it would be willing to pay a dollar or two more for the size of the book to be increased..dontaylor195
3,"Difficult to Read, Archaic Type","This particular edition is just a reprint of the original New England Primer. It's great if you're looking at it for historical research, but not useful as a textbook due certain archaic features like ""s""s being written as ""f""s. It's also extremely small (check the dimension before you order)."
3,"One Star For Presentation... Numerous Typos Require Attention, Fieve Stars for Content.","Although the text is an essential read for all Christians and parents, I am disappointed in the enormous volume of typographical errors. Especially the mispelling of our Lord Christ. With simple spell check, this text would be respectable. I purchased it to read to and with my children, yet the numerous errors distract from focusing on the content. One Star for Presentation.Five Stars for Content."
3,Not what the Description Said,"I had a ground loop problem with my subwoofer. Needed a directional coaxial cable. The description said the cable had a directional arrow on the cable. It did not. So I ordered a different subwoofer cable and it was right. The first cable is probably perfect for what it does, but the description is not correct. I kept the cable instead of trying to ship and going thru the hassle."
3,Where It's At,"This is a bare-bones, fat-free, reference for online jobseekers. If you have a vague sense that a site exists but don't remember its name, you can probably find it here. If you're totally new to the web or online job hunting, this book won't explain it to you. It doesn't evaluate the sites, or even structure the presentation in any meaningful way--the listing is alphabetic. What it lacks in analysis, it makes up in breadth. It's a quick, mostly accurate, overview of 250 job websites."
5,Good replacement for pad that comes with Meguiar's carnauba wax,Good replacement for pad that comes in Meguiar's carnauba wax can when that one falls to pieces after 12 years.
4,"Good product, could be bigger","These sponge applicators work very well at applying any wax or polish and make the job far more effecient and quicker than using a cloth applicator. I would recommend buying several packs because they do become dirty and need washing after every use. (So if one owns more than one car, or has a large vehicle like a truck or motorhome, then 1 applictor will not complete the job). Meguires could have made the sponges a bit larger (thus they get 4 stars instead of 5)."
3,not what i expected,"I ordered this product thinking i could use it to apply wax to my car. when i got it i realized it is meant to apply cleaning agents or conditioners to the interior of your car. my fault for not reading into it further. however since this is a review i will say i find it a little unnecessary that someone would need an applicator sponge to do that when a bounty towel has worked just fine for me all these years.Does it work, yes. Would i buy it again if i knew this is what it was for ?, no."
2,Non-native,I regret buying it is not the original Made in ChinaThat traditionNot in conformity with what the site you conceal the truth to pour money
1,you can get better copies of these movies on other sets,this is not one of the better sets of kung-fu . look for some of the other set and they have these and there quality of transfer is much better than this mess here
3,A little customization and it was ok...,"The fuel pump didn't exactly fit into the Blazer, we had to modify it to fit.Added a solid hour to our installation, but we got it to fit snug in the tank and now all is ok, car is firing up everytime. Just be prepared if you have that model for it not to fit, and don't force it, grind off the plastic ridge, and you should be fine."
5,Grind on Some Flava,"I only have one complaint about this disc-it's an EP...give us more music guys! I have played it constantly for weeks and am still addicted, and still crave more. If you're looking for something to groove to, these guys can throw it your way. Grindin on Some Flava and Weighted Voting System (now titled Bleep Bleep) are way up there on my faves list. Like nothing I've heard before-definitely something to jam to."
5,Great introduction to math programming/optimization,"I'm a PhD student in operations research, and this is a great operations research book. Its sometimes confusing that it has so many names: Mathematical programming, linear programming (and non-linear), industrial engineering, operations research, optimization etc.So this is an optimization book, not a computer programming book. Mathematical programming refers to both linear and non-linear optimization. I would recommend this as an introductory book in both the theory and the modeling aspect of operations research/ linear and non-linear optimization.For more advanced theory I would recommend the following (advanced undergrads and graduate students):Linear Programming (LP): Introduction to Linear Programming by Bertsimas and Tsitsiklis.Non-Linear Programming (NLP): Convex Optimization by Boyd and VandenbergheBoth LP and NLP: Linear and Nonlinear Programming by David G. Luenberger and Yinyu Yeenjoy!"
1,Awful explained textbook,"This is one of the worst textbooks I've ever had. It contains good examples, but terribly explained."
2,Violinsmart Pink Violin,"As a 8-year violin player, I was highly disappointed with this product. Altough, having spent a few thousand on my own violin, I expected a low quality violin, this was unacceptable. I tune kids all the time who have cheep quality instruments, but I was unable to get this violin to stay in tune for more that 2 measures of a song. This is a great violin for decorating and hanging on a cealing, but not for any more than that. Although many parents believe that a begining student does not need anymore than this quality of violin, this is simply not true. Speaking from experience, children with these types of instruments often become more frusterated with music than other children, and these instruments often break very quickly. If you are a parent loooking for an instrument for a child who is just begining lessons, I would strongly advise that you spend more on an instrument, or simply rent from the local music store.Best of luck,~C. Michelle"
2,"Not white paper, it is newspaper style paper","I bought this roll as a replacement to the roll of paper that came with our Alex art table. It was a great price and I thought it would be a great deal. Unfortunately when it came I was disappointed to see that it was not the same bright white, thick roll of Alex paper I expected. Instead it was clearly printed on the label that it was ""Newspaper"" paper. It was dull, very thin, prone to tearing paper. It's still usable, that's why I didn't give it one star, but I will not be ordering this paper again."
2,These are not your father's Sorels,"These are Sorels in name only. Columbia bought the Sorels name in a bankruptcy fire sale when the Canadian Kaufman company went out of business.Back in 1998, I actually found then-Canadian made Sorels in a St. Petersburg, Russia boutique.I have my own 15 year old pair I bought in Calgary, and they're bulletproof.These sorry Chinese-made knockoffs are a disgrace to the former Sorel tradition. If you never wore real Sorels, you may not appreciate this review. But if you have, you won't like what Amazon delivers to you."
3,great boot--waterproofing???,great boots confortable-great look-true to size-jury still out on the waterproofing-i work at a golf course and the first half of shift i work around standing water by midshift my socks are wet..so i guess if you don't work around standing water these are the boots for you
4,best pair of anything i've brought for 29.99,"I got these boot because of the positive reviews and price, couldn't be more happier. the boots are comfortable and easy to put on (little harder to take off). I been wearing em for a few months now, how ever didn't get a chance to wear them in the snow. the only issue is that my feet are wet from sweat by the end of the work day. the 1st few step i take leaves sweat prints on my hardwood. I also like the lacing system, the top eyehook holds the laces tight and in place so i really don't have to tie my shoe."
3,Timberwolve boots,excellent qualityhowever the tongue is sewn to the top so i cant get them onMay i return them? i have never worn them
2,Sizes run small... REALLY small,"These run extremely small for a men's boot.I ordered a men's 8.5 US which should equal about a 10.5 in women's US.When I got them they were way too small.In fact, they fit my mother perfectly and she wears a 9 women's US.She bought them off of me instead of me returning them.She says they are really warm, but stiff."
2,zen30gb case,Player is squeezed too tightly to play when case is closed and latched.It does protect the player but 1 side has to be left unlatched to operate the player.
3,Saints yard pendant flag,"Flag is made of high quality material. However one side of flag is not as ""finished"" looking as the other. Metal holder is not included as is with other flags in this price range."
3,"Quality is ok, but not great","I live in NYC, so I wanted to get something to show my pride for the Black and Gold at work. I didn't read the size description, so I was surprised at how big it is. A little too big, but I put it up anyway. It has two plastic loops at the end to hang it. It looks kinda cheap, and a lady passing my desk said it is the same quality of a boat flag/pennant.I like it, but probably wouldn't buy again if given the chance."
3,Not what I expected.,"I bought this thinking it addressed needs of online booksellers, but it focuses on antique and rare book sellers mainly."
5,Real Eye Opener,"I always like reading 1st person accounts because through them the reader gets a true feeling about the event, and this book is no exception. By reading the narratives you can really visualize how life was for the slaves. This is not a book of ""horror stories"" about slavery (although the horrors of slavery do come out!) and many of the slaves say they were treated ""well""; but are humans who are treated like livestock really treated ""well""? That is left up to the reader to decide. I would recommend this book for anyone, and especially those studying or teaching about the civil war."
5,Wow...,"What a great read. History comes alive. It amazed me that most of the people interviewed had lived so long, and remembered so much. I read on my lunch hour and with this book have been late getting back to work a couple of times because I could not put it down.All I can say is wow.."
4,Great,I like true history...not Novels....This was an enlightening book.....I would like to see more offereings from the National Archives.....very good
5,When I was a slave,Extremely enlightening. First person acounts of the daily lives of real slaves in an undramatized style.
4,A sad perspective on slavery,"There were a couple stories in this book that left tears in my eyes. May God have mercy on their souls for enduring so much. Slavery was such a heavy burden to carry. Now I understand why Oprah hates the N-word so much, cause the mentality of some slaves is that they did not deserve no better treatment then to be whipped like animals"
5,Powerful,"I think this book should be mandatory reading in grade school. I do tend to like books with ""from their own words"" concepts."
5,Awesome Book,"This book contains some valuable information for ""ALL"" couples, young and old alike. Mr. Harley takes all the quess work out and puts today's relationships into laymens words. I would highly recommend this book to everyone who wants a life time of happiness in a marriage. The book tells it like it is and should be. If you follow the guidelines in this book, your marriage is sure to succeed. Enjoy reading it, I did and have learned alot from it.Note: To those of you who have been married 2 or more times this book will surely help you to have a better understanding of what you need to make a marriage succeed for a lifetime."
4,One of the best beginners books available,"This book by Debby Sly is also published under the titles ""The Practical Riders Handbook"" and in large format as ""How to Ride"". It is also part of ""The Book of Horses and Horse Care"", so make sure you don't accidentally purchase this one twice! (the cover designs are all different too so watch out)Another really good starter, lots of pictures, everything from getting on and steering through to introducing many of the equestrian sports. Excellent step-by-step photos for the novice and close ups of simple concepts like correct leg position (with comparison photos). As you progress you will still find this a handy reference guide to have in the bookshelf."
1,Disappointing,I was looking forward to recieving this DVD - compilations of animated shorts seem to be sorely lacking on DVD for some reason. The visual and sound quality of this selection is truly awful. It looks and sounds as if it's copied from a fifth generation pirated VHS. Halas & Bachelor's seminal 'The Owl & The Pussycat' goes the same way as the other selections on this disc - unwatchable!
5,Great shoes,I really like these shoes! They have just the right size heel. I get some extra height and comfort for my feet.
3,Not enough detail,"Nicely organized so you can skip over the weapons that don't interest you. I was hoping for more detail on each weapon, but then I guess it would have to be called 25 Weapons. Also the many typos were irritating."
2,Can be a good review if used correctly,"This book is outdated, but does offer a wide variety of multiple choice questions. You MUST use it as a review and a means to spur new thought and point you in new directions of study. Don't think that reading it cover to cover and learning the answers will help you. Take the tests, find out what you got wrong, and focus on those areas. The Oral section is totally outdated. Your best bet is to read books like Arnheim cover to cover. Talk to ATC's in your school or your area to get their insight. I completed an internship (which is quickly becoming a thing of the past), and after reading countless books passed the written and written sim with flying colors. Don't neglect the practical. I thought this would be the easy part and blew it off. It came back to get me when I failed by 2 points. GOOD LUCK!!"
1,HOPE YOU GET ONE FOR A GIFT,",,,because these are the steaming piles of celluloid you watched on cable and searched for the game show channel immediately after."
2,Great product but half of the canisters are defective,Received containers and 2 of the 4 do not have the plastic seal that lines the inside of the lid to help create an air-tight seal. Would have gotten more stars but cant use the product for what it was intended for which was for food storage. Other wise containers were exactly what we were looking for.
2,Trudeau Canister 30oz NOT,"The Trudeau canister is advertised as 30oz, it barely holds 28 ounces of liquid filled to the rim. I bought it to store coffee but it only fits about half of a small can. Not worth the money."
2,False Advertising,"This item is described on Amazon as having a ""size"" of 32 oz. This has got to mean liquid ounces not weight. It is NOT 32 oz. as advertised. Only 24 liquid ounces can be put in this jar and still close the lid. It will not even hold 1/2 lb of coffee, therefore it is pretty useless for this purpose, which is what I bought it for. Amazon should stop giving false information about its products."
4,Great for Tea,"I bought two of these to hold the loose leaf tea I like, and it works like a charm. They are pretty air tight, but I not say they make a perfect deal, and I say this because as I buy 2 different tea blends and I mix them inside this container, I have found that some of the really small leaves will come out on occasion. I have found my tea lasts months inside this container, while continuing to remain fresh though, so I would recommend this to anyone looking for inexpensive containers."
3,Nice container. Not even half the size stated.,"I also purchased this container to hold my 16OZ bags of coffee. The stainless steel construction and tight sealing lid are perfect. But I can only get half of one 16OZ bag of coffee in it. So, not as useful as I wanted. Keep this in mind if you too are looking for a coffee container."
2,This isn't a 30 ounce canister,"While I will still give a couple of stars for this item, it is certainly not a 30 oz canister. I bought this for the purpose of emptying my 12 & 16oz bags of coffee into it. To my surprise and dismay, I opened the 16oz bag and couldn't get the canister to hold half the bag... which is 8 oz. I'm not sure the manufacturer was thinking, but something is definitely off here. I ordered a 30 oz canister and that is what I expected to receive.with so many other people indicating that this is NOT a 30 oz container and barely holds half a 16oz bag of coffee, the seller should send an actual 30 oz container with a credit from what we paid for this one."
2,Seal issues,The seal separated from the lid within 2 months...Gave it 2 stars only for the way it perfectly matches my coffee machine :)
3,You get what you pay for...,The canister had a great price. The quality is decent (for holding my ground coffee). The hardware and finish are nice. The only complaint is with the seal. The seal would separate from the top when opened. This was fixed with some Krazy Glue!
1,Misleading information - or downright lies,"This item arrived last night and I'm very disappointed. First, the listing has a choice of 32 ounce size or 52 ounce size. However in the body, it states it's 32 ounces so I thought ""Ok, maybe I can deal with it."" However, it only holds 24 ounces max. Since I ordered it to hold a mix I make for milk baths that creates 32 ounces, it's useless to me and I am returning.Shame on Amazon and the seller for giving such bad information and wasting my time!"
3,Not too sturdy!,I ordered two of the containers - unfortunately both arrived dented due to poor packing. They should not have dented that easily as each had several dents. I returned them and will purchase porcelain containers instead.
2,food storage,This was definitely not what I expected. I was looking for a larger container to store ground coffee and the 30 ounces was very deceiving to me. The container is very small. I don't like returning anything so I kept it and put M & M's in it for the great grandkids but had to go online and look elsewhere for what I really wanted. The container is very nice but too small for almost anything.
2,"Mediocre game, opportunity wasted","Some of the graphics and character modelling look great, but that's the best the game has to offer. The gameplay is uninspired: you run through a level, fighting guys, until you get to the end of the level, then you go to the next level. There's no strategy to it and nothing to think about. You just tap keys a lot. The game levels are interwoven with cut scenes, both animated and filmed, which is actually annoying in practice; you want to play the game and you have to stop and wait far too long to do so. Plus the inflexible game save system forces you to watch the same movies over and over again for difficult levels. The controls are awkward. The story, such as it is, is unnecessary, and anyway if they wanted to tell a story they should have just released it as a video like The Animatrix. The saddest thing is that they wasted a great opportunity to make a mind-blowing game; the game is sadly conventional."
4,was worth the money,"I bought this game on on disk it only worked in a DVD drive. It is in no way the greatest game i've ever played, but for the price it is a great buy."
2,Almost as bad as the sequels.,"Everyone has their own idea of tasteful and tacky.Rundown, shabby, lacking style, dowdy.The developers of this game took a great idea and made a few bucks off it. Had they put a little more effort into the look and feel of the game, and possibly the story, they could have made a lot of bucks off it.As it is, it looks like a console port and plays like a console port. The graphics, for all the hype, are hardly cutting edge, and the gameplay is buggy.Halfway through the game, instead of asking ""What is the Matrix?"", I was thinking ""Why am I bothering?"" The only reason I kept playing was to see the filmed cutscenes, and even they were lifeless.Get this game when it goes in the dollar bin. Otherwise, don't waste your money."
3,over priced for a ho-hum game,"I personally liked Matrix Reloaded, but not as much as the first movie. But this game is quite dull. I have not finished it yet, but have not been that compelled to even play it for more than the couple of hours I have put in so far. There are only 2 characters and 3 difficulty levels so replay value is minimal. The controls are awkward, the graphics lackluster, and the game plot is boring. The focus/bullet time gimmick is not that great and certainly cannot salvage this game. Save your money-there are much better games out there."
2,So bad it will make you gag,"This is nothing but a ... Atari + Matrix trademark package. A stroke of genious from pr perspective. I'll have to agree with some of the previous reviewers stating that this game was rushed. The game needed about a year more to fermentate. The graphics are horrible for a PC title. This is like going back to the original nintendo after playing Max Payne or Hitman. You would expect the game to play smooth with its simpler graphics, but no such luck. As soon as any type of action kicks in the game turns chopy. The motion capture isn't fluid and the model physics are incredibly poor. This could of been a game of the year, uhh back in 1992. ..."
2,almost a waste of money,"pros:-cool moves-have some deleted scenes of the movie-use ""Hacking"", to get more features(such as getting new messages)cons:-a waste of space!4 cds, 4 GBS!- the controlls are complex- the mouse sensitivty are different ( the speed of selecting sometime is different from viewing and sniping)- the graphic sucks and everything is all dark-sometime the game froze at the menui play alot of games and when i read about how EtM sucks, i thought, how bad can it be? well its the worst i hav ever seen.its almost a rip off of the game ""Max payne"". if you get a chance to buy this game, PASS ON THAT!"
2,"good effort, bad result","this game had a lot of potential. i was ravenous as i tore open the packaging, only to find out that i had spent 50$ on a subpar game. while at first the martial arts and gunplay was exciting and hooked me, it quickly got repetitive and boring. how many times can u watch the same animations over and over before it gets dull? Plus, there are glitches aplenty. deleted games and hours spent stuck in walls are rampant. i give it a 2 because of the first few hours and because of the real cinematics incorporated into the game."
2,Played better,"Plays like the console port that it is. Turning around, even with the mouse sensitivity maxed is sluggish at best, very detrimental during battle or even rounding corners. The ""Focus Flash"" turns what could have been a cool effect into a seizure session. Better control of the camera angles would have been helpful, as would have being able to choose where (in the game AND in memory) to save. The Hacking is a nice idea and well done but I found the gameplay to be annoying and monotonous. The storyline nicely compliments the movie but overall I found ""Enter the Matrix"" highly disappointing."
4,Very Fun!,"Great game! I have beat the first several stages and am impressed with the depth of the action and sound effects. The driving levels aren't the best, but I really enjoyed the level where the Twins are on your tail, and also the chasing Morpheus level.All in all, an excellent game.I would skip the cutscenes though, they have lots of language and adult content."
1,...,"C'mon!! it's 2003!!! cars in this game have square wheels! this game has 2001 graphics and game play is horrible! The idea for this game is phenomenal, but execution is big ZERO. Save your money."
2,very sloppy,"Althought it started with a nice concept (a game that used the movie licence to such as extent the movie directors wrote the script for the game), the implementation is very sloppy. From the glitchy graphics, clipping, damage, etc. to the incredibly bad interphase, you can tell that Shiny really had to hurry to make the May 15 release. The mouse support during the driving is absolutely horrid, as it the menu selection. The Matrix: reloaded concurrent story line is very nice, and most likely the only reason anyone can find to play the game. And while the live footage is a very nice touch, the in game animations are choppy and unatural at best. Hopefully, Shiny can fix some of these problems with a patch or two, but there's a limit to what can be patched. Save your money and buy the Matrix: Reloaded when it comes to DVD."
1,...,"A slipshod, disappointing attempt at milking a franchise to video game form. Graphics are ""blah"". Extra film footage is mediocre; certainly nothing to write home about. Driving/shooting levels are pathetic, and the last levels are an anti-climactic joke. The publishers and developers should be paying you to play this game.Hardcore Matrix fans only need apply. Everyone else, stay very very far away."
4,Matrix Re-Loaded..,"OK so after all the hype the game is finally here.. Atari/Infogrames staked alot on this title and it seems to have paid off.. The game is very large but worth the hard disk space.. Ok so the focus option has been seen in Max Payne but it appeared in the Matrix Movie first.. So we can leave that bit out.. The first level is a great way to get into the game, lots of action although the fact that people you have already wasted re-appear is annoying.. The graphics are good although they could have been a little more polished (guess thats the problem with strict release dates). Multi-player would have been nice (they could have included the training simulator as seen in the movie) Sound is great, it gives you the feeling of really being there.. If they can iron out the bugs and release an update then this would be a fine game to add to your collection."
1,The biggest deception of 2003,"I feel sorry for Shiny entertaiment, and the creators of the matrix, this game is such a disappointment.Don't buy this game, it is horrible, I think the programers didn't have enough time to create it.1. Bad graphics.2. Lack of imagination (maps).3. Very short game (you can finish it in 5 hours)4. Fighting with weapons is just imposible!"
3,this game had soooo much potential...,"Not to say that some of it isn't fun. The kung fu moves are the most fluid and realistic i have ever seen. But all i do is button smashing. I really haven't learned how to compine buttons together to make awesome combos that i planned out. And to sit down and try to figure out how to do just this doesn't really work out either. The focus thing is overrated, helps alot when firing a gun...but their are hardly any special fighting moves that you get with using it. (only like jumping off wall and kicking someone). I like the way the agents were designed. They block moves in a realistic fasion. rent before buying. Its better to get in on consol, even if graphics are better for pc since the game is for hitting buttons. Not much sniper work involed. The driving parts of the game is soo [messed] up. Its so stupid, all of the cars are bouncing around like pimp mobiles. anyway, its fun for what it is."
2,A step back in game playing technology (PC version),"The ONLY reason this gets two stars is because it is a cool idea to reveal extra story via an interactive video game (even if it is just to extend the marketing arm of the movie). However, the graphics are terrible and the controls are more than terrible. You spend most of your time being shot by people you can't even see because the camera is pointing the wrong direction. And there is no aiming reticle in 3rd person. In other words, you just shoot a lot and hit something about every 10th shot or so. In scenes with cars the wheels are SQUARE (and I'm running a VERY top of the line system)! That should give you some idea of how disappointing this is. I'll play through it just to get the extra story, but I'll be a very happy person once this failure is off my computer."
1,Worst Game Ever,"A huge production budget couldn't save this abomination. For one thing, the game feels cheap and there are very very few variations in gameplay. for all it's vaunted separate campaign paths, it's still linear and moreover... BORING.Get Deus Ex or Max Payne."
2,Could anything have lived up to the hype?,"I don't think so.Although it's an ingenious concept, marketing-wise, I found this game not worth the money I spent on it.You'd think on a modern system (Athlon XP 2200+, GeForce4, and 512MB ram) that it would run flawlessly on low resolution with all the details off. It doesn't. When the enemies pile on, framerates fall to the point where it gets completely unplayable.You'd think that during some missions when you have an AI driver, it would be able to stay on the road and not get stuck behind a wall so that you die... twice.All in all, stay away from the PC version of this game. It's not worth your money. If you want to play it, play it on a console, and rent it instead."
2,Run away!,"A waste of the 3.5 gig installation space. This game is just bad. Sure it's got some nice features, but the developers left out an important one -- gameplay. The gameplay is horrible and the driving levels will make you long for the crappy gameplay that the rest of the game has. I'm using a trainer to try to follow the story and not have to worry about gameplay and can just run through -- but I still have to do the stupid driving levels! This one definitely wins the Daikatana award for 2003 -- all hype. It'd be nice if they released a story version or movie that'll tell the story of the game without us having to play the wretched thing."
2,"too much hype, not enough game.","I didn't like this game too much. The only thing I liked was the bullet time type fighting, but after a while it gets boring and so does the redundant fighting. It seems they just place you in a building, mumble something about why your there, and then 50 guys suddenly appear that you have to fight. Try another game."
4,Better than the Movie,I saw Matrix reloaded and didn't understand it. I played this game and it put things together. This game is really fun. I played though it the first time and my mouth was wide open. The highlight of this game is the hand to hand combat. IT AMAZING!!! This game takes back everything that Max Payne stole from the Matrix and kicks it up a notch. The story is excellent... you even get to fight Trinity hand to hand which is probably one of the coolest things in the game.
3,Save your money!,"Don't be fooled. While The Matrix Reloaded might've been a GREAT movie, this game just doesn't cut it. The idea of the game is great, thus, giving this game great potential, but the developers simply didn't use all the potential it had. This game lacked in every aspect, the only thing that might've been good was the gameplay. The controls are espiecially difficult to master. I can't imagine what they were thinking, and why they didn't use different setups. The graphics are horrible as well, and the sound isn't original. The only thing that appealed to me (the only original idea of the game), is that you can hack into computers, where you'd be given a real DOS prompt, and you have to hack yourself in (without any command lists). But if you arn't a computer genius, that part will be hard as well, and you'll be forced to use guides. This game isn' worth the money at all, BELIEVE ME ON THIS!"
3,May have to hack your way into installing it,"The install was very glitchy. It got though to the final disc and then asked for the first one again. When I put it in, the whole install crashed and it erased 3 CD's worth of installation. I finally got past this by pressing continue while on the final (""play"") disc install the first time it asked for volume 1 and then responding normally when it asked again at the very end of the install (green bar maxed out). The support website suggests trying to just copy all the discs to your hard drive and installing from there. A DVD version of the game might work better too. Then I had to patch my video and sound cards plus the game. Got a blank screen... then tried switching the game resolution from 800x600 to 1024x768 to match my desktop and it finally worked! Gameplay was okay.. my favorite parts were the videos and the focus fighting (bullet-time) while the driving parts sucked. Still, it was nice to get some extra details of the Matrix story from the game."
3,Should've been a movie...,"All the bad things you read here are true. Those that say it's the best game or best fps don't play games or fps. The gameplay is mediocre at best, the graphics are passable, but nothing to get really excited about. However...The game is worth enduring to get through the story. Despite what others say, the cutscenes/film clips are great. In fact, the character development, story and dialogue are better than Reloaded. The dialogue between Ghost and Trinity is more witty, ironic and entertaining than anything that has come out of either movie.After completing about half the game, I decided to enable god mode because the gameplay was just getting in the way and I wanted to see the next cutscene. Taken with ""The Final Flight of the Osiris"", Enter the Matrix develops a great backstory and even has some plot points missing from Reloaded that will play heavily into Revolutions."
2,Just not very good,"I love action games and the Matrix, so I was really looking forward to this game. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. From the very first time I watched Ghost flail his arms when he ran, I knew this game just wasn't going to cut it. In the attempt to make a workable control system, Shiny has made something that doesn't respond fluidly. Instead, the focus jumps between targets, jerking the viewpoint around and making navigation difficult. Additionally, the game is way too under-challenging. I'm no expert player, but all you have to do is sit still for a few seconds and your health just magically refills. It really sucks the challenge out of the game. Maybe a few patches down the road things will be better, but things are still way too rough at version 1.52"
1,Wow.,"I don't mean wow as in a good thing. I have been a PC Gamer for about 10 years now. I have played some bad games in my time, even horrible games. Enter the Matrix is the worst though. The story is nothing special and the control scheme is horrible. I found it impossible to move myself around with ease. The hacking segment of the game is an innovative idea but it is so poorly executed that you feel as though you are simply typing in random things.Take my advice, if you want a cool shooter with bullet time dont get Enter The Matirx, spend your money on Max Payne which is waaay cheaper."
1,"Poor service, deceptive ad","The seller, The Factory Depot, sent a generic remanufactured toner cartridge instead of the new Verbatim toner cartridge advertised in the item listing. The seller's return policy indicates that ""consumables"" like toner cartridges are not returnable.The seller's customer service was not responsive but Amazon customer service was helpful and refunded the item."
4,An excellent report on British buses!,"A very nice look into the world of British buses, with loads of pics of double and single decker buses in every issue. Info on preservation, toy models, book reviews. My one complaint is that it's small (only 65 pages) and about 15 of them are devoted to fleet news around the UK, which goes into detail about what every company has in stock, any transactions made, any new paint jobs, any taken out of service, etc. It is a 15 page list by city/company with mostly text and very few good pictures. It's a useless part of the book for myself, who is just an American lover of British buses, and I don't care which company owns which style buses at the current time. Also Ian Allen publishing puts out Bus and Coach Preservation magazine, which I prefer to this one, as it's devoted to preserved buses and does not have the 15 pages of fleet news, which still having all the lovely photos and history on this great vehicles."
4,A fun and charming female adventure!,"Gerda, a naive though endearing teenage girl living in nineteenth century Denmark, could never be called the adventurous type. And yet, when her dear friend Kai is stolen by a mysterious woman known as the Snow Queen, she knows that there is nothing she can do besides follow him to the ends of the earth to rescue him! And this she does, until she is captured by the warrior robber-maid Ritva...This truly was an entertaining story; with two interesting and unusual heroines, who are sure to win the heart of anyone who reads this book. The plot was fast paced enough so I didn't get bored, but not so unbearably tense (at least not til the end) that I couldn't relax while I was reading it. I adore fantasy stories, and yet I'm also completely sick of the repetative rendition of the young boy hero rescuing the girl from evil. This refreshing, unusual tale is a real gem, completely turning things around, which I greatly enjoyed. Good for anyone twelve or older."
4,Interesting,"This is a really interesting version of the Snow Queen. It often when directions that I wasn't expecting, which I love. The writing is great. I had never read Eileen Kernaghan before so was happy the authors voice was so clear and interesting. It feels like a old time fairy tale or fable. It is a very short novel, which was a little disappointing."
5,Quite a breakthru in Theasurus,I am currently a high school student in Singapore and sometimes find English a difficult subject to tackle. The Roget A to Z can achieve something that a Dictionary cannot. Yet it is much easier to use comparing to other theasurus. It is listed in alphabeticaly form and so there is no difficulty looking for a word. I mean it is a must to buy it if you want to learn English seriously. But I don't understand why my teacher prefer the Penguin Roget's Theasurus. It is small and contains nothing. Maybe my teacher is just not ready for a revolution in theasurus!
1,Why bother?,"I have the same opinion about this game as I do the Hellfireexpansion for Diablo: If you are going to release an updated versionor expansion to something, it needs to be an improvement. This game isa Diablo clone with a few 3D tricks thrown in to make it shiny and new. There is nothing here that is worth wasting the price of entry. If you have Diablo already, dont bother with this. If you bought this and havent played Diablo, dont buy Diablo..."
3,way to much of a Diablo offshoot,"There really is no storyline to this game. All you do is go to the dungeon, kill monsters, and come back. THATS IT. There is no real character interaction, no plot development, and no detail in the 5 house town.the good side- a way to have a little fun and kill something. (may sound twisted, but hey when your bored, it may be the only thing to do). There are some cool items to buy and find, and the unlimited views are amazing. You can literally have ANY view you want of the character. Plus, the loading time is short.I suggest you buy this game if you liked Diablo, but if you want a REAL RPG then get Baldur's gate or Ultima Collection."
2,Terrible game,"I've played a lot of games in the past few years, and Dark Stone has to be one of the most boring games in the world. When it was new it did have it's halfway decent (although a little too cartoonish) graphics. But now that the game is a few years old, it cannot even claim that.A bad attempt at a slightly more complicated Diablo, this game just doesn't cut it."
4,Variation on a theme...,"Look, Darkstone is to Diablo what Hexen was to Doom. Or what Warcraft is to Command and Conquer. They share a lot of the same commands, and a good bit of the gameplay is the same. So if you're going to sit there and fault one game for following in the design footsteps of another, we're going to be here all day.I recently purchased Darkstone for just twenty bucks. Twenty bucks! Too often I've spent twice as much and didn't receive half as much fun as Darkstone deliveres.It boils down to this: If you already own Diablo and it satifies your need for hack and slash adventure, then by all means save your money. But if you're looking for a variation on a theme (and I think the 3D effects add a good bit to the gameplay), and you're looking for a new quality game at a budget price, then Darkstone is a great choice."
2,"Some good advice, but with condescending tone.","There must be better advice books for female faculty available...aren't there? Maybe not since this one was recommended by a friend. I found some of the advice very comforting (e.g. that young male students will challenge young female faculty), mainly because it helped me feel like my experiences were not all my fault, but were a common part of life for young female faculty. But some of her advice is just odd (e.g. don't ride your bike to work if it makes you stand out). Throughout the book, she refers to herself as ""Ms. Mentor"" (e.g. ""Ms. Mentor thinks..."", ""Ms. Mentor recommends...""), which I found a little hard to take."
5,"Useful, funny, provocative -- buy several as gifts!","I really love this book, love the questions, the answers, and the fact that Toth does, among many others, two things that I find immeasurably valuable. The first is that she takes women, their questions, their problems,their crises, their triumphs, their ambitions, and their differences seriously. The second is that she doesn't take anyone or anything seriously. I can't wait for the sequal."
5,First-rate; HIGHLY recommended,"As one who has already ""succeeded"" by Toth's criteria (I have tenure at a major university--whew!), I've bought several copies of this book already to give to all my female grad students and teaching assistants. It's must reading for any woman in academia--and I'd recommend it to men, as well (much of the advice could apply to them, and the rest should be read as guidance as to what they should *avoid*!)."
1,What?,"This book is easily the most insulting thing that I have read in a good long while. The author is curiously espousing feminism with one hand and slapping it in the face with the other.Married? Never reveal that! You'll get discriminated against! Gay? Never reveal that! You'll get discriminated against! Disabled? Make a joke of it so no one has to feel uncomfortable! Children? Should be unseen and not heard, especially on campus! Fat? Lose weight or you'll get discriminated against! Attractive? Make yourself unattractive so your students won't hit on you! Huh?Sorry, the academy needs to change certainly, but the only effective way to do that is to become the change ourselves and not hide behind the rhetoric of victimology that this author advocates."
4,Take it with a grain of salt,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book, and found myself laughing out loud at parts. However, it should be read as a tongue-in-cheek look at academia, not as a literal guide for survival. Her advice is witty and stylish, and Ms. Manners herself would approve."
1,"Great Idea, just dies a lot","If you are doing any gaming at all online, run away from this product. The concept behind this software is fantastic, but reliability is spotty. Tells you exactly what is on the network and when, but randomly fails to connect to the internet saying the network is down (even when it is up) failing every 20-45 minutes. I know the network is good because when I look at the connector for the cat 5 cable on the comp it has an amber light on telling me it has good signal, and if I kill the NM process in the Windows task manager I can connect via XP connection wizard no problem, even though NM says it tried to fix the connection and couldn't. when I uninstalled NM, my network became rock solid again, too bad for Network MAgic. Great idea, poor execution."
1,Great concept that doesn't work,"I bought and installed Network Magic and had constant problems with it crashing my machine and having to send error reports to Microsoft. Even after there upgrade it didn't help the error reports. Along with HP net work printer it was a disaster. After removing all of the soft ware for the hp 2610 all in one printer there still where problems. I waited for a couple of weeks to see if they where supporting my linksys router, I reinstalled it again and an error showed up on my other computer that didn't have Network Magic installed. I uninstalled it for the last time."
1,P.O.S.,"This program is probably one of the most useless programs I've ever used. It has been the biggest headeache. I purchased it to be able to print wirelessly. When it works, which is rare, it's great. I've tried everything to make it work (as I couldn't get mhy $ back) and finally gave up and just uninstalled it for good. Installed a similar program and have had no problems with it so far."
1,Software is outdated at lease 5 years,This software is outdated at lease 5 years and cost me $10.00 this to sent back this outdated software and not made anymore and you can download a free version ver. 5.0 but it strill a big price of crap ever made
3,Mixed Feelings,The product worked well once you got comfortable with it however it is now discontinued and without support. Cisco purchased this and is not supporting this product and its the responsibility of the defunct company. Avoid the product currently
2,Poor customer service from Cisco,"The webpage doesn't clearly state the basic level gives little to no capabilities. The links on the purenetworks website for upgrading do not work and no direct contact information is available. When trying to register, key server was constantly down. Took 30 days for response to open ticket. Once the call was returned, the server ""magically"" started working. Also had to go through the same painful drill during the upgrade (at full purchase price since upgrade link doesn't work). After all that, software is not fully compatible with Windows 7; they stopped at VISTA. So it can't detect virus protection, etc. Lots of alerts that have to be turned off. Will not buy again. Disappointing from Cisco."
1,uninstall won't remove all of it,"This mess is everywhere on my computer, even after I uninstalled it! I've tried different ways to get it off my computer and including search and destroy, lol ;) (manual removal of parts) Needless to say I didn't care for the program."
5,Fantastic!,"Two wired PCs (XP Prof, XP Home), one wireless PC (Win 98), one wireless laptop (XP Home), one wireless print server, and newest addition wireless TIVO .... with Windows alone I had them all going at some time, but never all together. Network Magic and one hour later, I am now looking at a fully functional network, can control EVERYTHING from one user interface. Great product!"
5,Good software,"Hi everyone,I think this program is great. I have networked 3 computers and a 3in1 printer and all seem to work great together with easy access when needed. With wireless, this program makes it easy to do everything from my comfortable recliner while sipping on a good strong cup of jo. Take care!!"
4,"Try it, you'll like it","This is a fine program. Yeah, geeks will say that it doesn't do much more than what's already available in Windows XP but, for the rest of us, this will save hours setting up a network on our home computers. Okay, there's no manual (yet) but their tech support, both E-mail and toll free telephone, is exceptional and, for some of us, that's better than a manual since they address our specific concerns. I have two desktops and a laptop networked with four printers and they all work! I haven't tried file sharing or the remote access features but those are bonuses anyway. You will also learn to appreciate the extras such as info about each computer's memory, signal strength of remote signal, IP & Mac addresses, etc. For the current price of $29.99, this is a bargain."
5,Great Solo Album!,"This is a great album filled with inspirational and love songs from broadway and beyond... For those of you die-hard Miss Saigon fans, you'll be delighted with Jennifer Paz's beautiful vocals. The duets with Lea Solanga, Dane Stokinger, and Jose Llana are heartwarming. A definite CD worth having!"
2,Batman sucked dry,"I recently purchased and read the ""Batman Vampire"" series due to my intrigue of batman being turned into a vampire. I dimwittedly expected this comic to hold a great story with stunning artwork and I was completely let down. The story is about as cliché as any vampire story but now with the characters of batman thrown in. Having read many Batman comic books with plot, character development, mystery and enemy fight sequences I was very disappointed with the lack of anything resembling batman in this book.The vampires are more like zombies, Dracula is presented terribly, and the worse is a scrawny vampire wearing a cape and cowl. Everything the batman empire ever built is destroyed in this story and I feel sucked dry of any...you get the point. Save your money and time by avoiding this crappy drawn and written comic. 2 stars for mindless goreIf you really want a good Batman series check out HUSH, KNIGHTFALL, and of course The Long Halloween."
4,"Very different, but very good","I still haven't finished reading this graphic novel yet, but so far it's really good."
2,Red Rain,"This is one of Batman's ""Elseworlds"" adventures, as opposed to the ""real-life"" Batman adventures. As you might guess from the title, Batman meets Dracula. DC probably had to step carefully to avoid treading on Marvel's copyrights on the Dracula character, and that results in a seriously underwhelming villain. The art, heavily influenced by Bernie Wrightson (and I'm being very kind here), is interesting, but Kelly Jones has never learned to draw human beings in proper proportions: Thalidomide flipper limbs sprout off mutant musclebound torsos, and bodies twist around in knotted, impossible contortions. Doug Moench apparently never got the memo that comix grew up, so he continues to write florid, overwrought funny book prose. One character even throws his head to the sky and bellows, ""NOOOOOOOOOO!!!!"" The balloon-breasted heroine, for no good reason, wears a skintight one-piece and thigh-highs. Nothing about this book elevates it from geeky juvenilia."
5,This is a must have book!,"I see a lot of books in my work at MarketingResultsCoach.com - authors come to me and say ""my book is my life's work"" and when I see them.. I think ""some life"".This one is different. It's the real deal. A compilation of Dr. Nell's life work, and one of the heaviest books I've reviewed this year. I've only read some of the chapters, and keep picking it up to read more. I've bought each for my kids, and will buy another today to give as a gift.I call it a ""text book for living""Warren Whitlock - MarketingResultsCoach.comco-author of the #1 best seller ""Wake Up... Live the Life You Love"""
3,Nothing New Here,"I agree with some of the previous reviews this is just your average aliens invade the earth book. There hundreads of these types of book and virtually everybody eles that I can think does a better job. Two main problems1. The aliens are too human-Whatever happened to just plian old bloodthristy aliens? The bad guys can't make up there mind one minute they want to be our friends the next they want to kill us.2. The writting style is just crap, as much as I wanted to like the book the writting style prohibited that. As a result you can't really get involved in the story. If you can't do that than you can't get to know the charecters and therefore you have wasted your money.One last thing-most of these soliders reminded me of the reservists from ""Southern Comfort"" for some reason."
2,Wither the Ending?,"What is it with Science Fiction that refuses to have an ending? In this case we have an Alien Invasion story with a twist and a ""believable"" human reaction. There's the discovery, conflict and characters. What's there is good.But then it's cut. It stops. Did funding run out? Is this some bizarre attempt to be profound?I'm very afraid that this was some kind of attempt to start a series. ""If this does well, we'll do a sequel!"" Well bullocks to that.There are situations unresolved, questions not answered, possibilities unexplored and characters left hanging. In this case it seems that the author either got bored or chickened out. Whatever the reason, you'll be disappointed."
5,An exceptional book,I have just finished reading Dayton Wards The Last World War. It is an awesome read. It is one of those books that you don't want to put down until its finished. What impressed me is getting to see the aliens points of view. That is both the good ones and the ones considered bad. All is not in black and white and we can really sympathize with all sides . There definately needs to be a follow up to this storyl
4,World War could be the beginning of a new series,"What the first few reviewers say is correct, but only to an extent. The auther has a great idea that hasn't been done before in this manner. Yes, there are minor glitches but none are fatal. There is the big governmental that tries to hide Alien contact but it is logical and never devolves into the X-files concept.With this idea, I can forsee a whole series of books, not only in the war genre but but classical SF in that the gates are used for exploration and colonization.All in all I found it a good read and look forward to the next book from ward. I would recomend it."
2,Completely Uneven witn No Ending,"The book is written very unevenly. It almost seems like its a compilation of two separarate manuscripts. The first part contains mediocre character development, but then for a good section in the middle, all of those characters are gone and the new characters have zero development. I was intrigued enough about the general idea to finish, but there was no ending, so even if you bother to make it through, there is no reward at the end. I'd advise a pass."
2,The Last World,"At best this is a ""fair"" read. For anyone with some military experience it is even less so. The characters tend to be stereotypical and not realistic in most cases. The plot ""twists"" are obvious from early on and don't really twist that much. What I found most frustrating was that the author didn't take the 20 seconds needed to do some simple research in various areas. For example, Tornados (or any aircraft) would not attack a ground target with Sidewinder missiles since they are air-to-air missiles. Such sloppiness in details is apparent throughout the book.If you get frustrated with people who try to demonstrate their knowledge of a particular area and then wind up showing you how little they really do know, you will want to throw this book against the wall at various times.If you are looking for something to pass boring hours in the airport this book may just keep you mildly entertained."
4,Alive in the Underground,"This was definately in my top 5 of album releases for last year. This cd is phenominal I can't even begin too speak of it. This band is one of the most influential bands too be spawned from MetalBlade in the past 10 years. Many people have knocked on it so much about ""ewww, it has too many breakdowns"" what you people don't understand is that this band is a LIVE ORIENTED BAND which means that their shows a freakin' brutal!!!!! Mosh's everywhere, I know I live in SC and saw them twice. They're also cool people too hang with. Great, great album, but they could have done without so many breakdowns. Pick up this album!!!! Long live the Underground!!!"
1,Many Laughs,"You would need a calculus formula to calculate the amount of breakdowns on this CD, and a strong will to find a part of a song that isn't a breakdown. Typical mosh pit nonsense, with intense militant lyrics to back it all up: ""Nowhere to hide, searching for a piece of pie!"" This disc will leave you hungrier for a good song than the singer is for a piece of pie."
1,"This version is NOT 90 minutes long, it is 82 minutes, and looks bad, too.","I ordered one of these as ""used"", from an Amazon Seller, and what came was not 90 minutes long (I timed it very carefully). It was 82 minutes like nearly everybody else's version.And, it looked really bad by usual DVD standards -- like as if somebody had made a really bad copy of a VHS tape or something like that. There were none of the usual DVD setup screens, chapters, or anything, which just makes me suspect even more that somebody just dubbed this version off of a VHS tape.Bottom line: I sent the DVD back to the seller and got a refund (which took over a month). Now, I'll just wait for ""The Blob"" to be shown on TCM or OnDemand or something like that. It's a sweet, old movie, and my 1-star rating is not aimed at the movie itself or anything about it, per se. But I'm not paying well over twenty bucks for a shortened version of it, and which looks like some VHS taped version."
2,Sent two different things.,I got both of these sets. One in metric and SAE. The metric came in a nice red case when the SAE did not. Dissapointed that I got two different items in different ways. They advertise this piece as a 9 piece set when the metric was the only one that had the case. The rack isnt even usable. Its cheap plastic and is a pain to use. This should be an eight piece. I need tools for my profession and dont know If I will be ordering from this them again.
3,Cheap and cheerful,"John Grenham is a professional genealogist as was formerly with the Genealogical Office in Dublin. This book is like a mini version of ""Clans and Families of Ireland"". It includes a short account of the origin, distribution and coat of arms of about 100 of the commonest surnames in Ireland. Only buy if you are to mean to spend the extra money on ""Clans and Families of Ireland""."
3,Old Navigation Book,"The short book on navigation is obviously made by a pulp writer. It is windy and is full of useless stories aboutthe old days in manual navigation. While it does cover the matter of maps and compass it is neglectful in theuse of GPS, which is everywhere today. I would say you are not getting much for your money.I would look to other publications, even government ones, that cover navigation matters more correctly."
5,Very Comprehensive and easy to understand,The book discusses in detail every technique that you need to know to become a very good land navigator. It explains very simply and clearly the different types of maps and compasses. Teaching the novice or expert basic and advance navigational techniques which are both simple and practical. So far this is the best book that I have read with regards to land navigation.
2,not for a beginner,"I don't know anything about land navigation and hoped that this book would help me. But it does not explain many of the concepts, and it doesn't even have a glossary. It has a topographic map in the back, but it is hard to follow the references to it. I consider myself a reasonably intelligent guy, but I've had trouble learning from this book."
5,"Beautiful Bracelet, Beautiful Price","The Peridot Diamond Shaped Bracelet by ""Cute Stretchy Gems"" is a good example of the translucent variety of the gemstone. Though not of faceted gemstone quality it is a very consistant light mint green color. It reminds one of Jade, a little, but more translucent. It will fit a 7"" wrist comfortably."
1,Solar Spot Light,Disappointed in the amount of light it gives. Disappointed in the product and also the advertising that says it is a strong solar light. Not worth the money spent.
4,US Postal Service Stamps and Stories,"Very old book, condition was to be expected. Great book for learning about the people and places behind the stamps. Other stamp encyclopedias are very technical for the serious collector."
1,Dreadful,I almost walked out on my own television after renting this dreadful production. My goodness what a poorly made......movie.Don't waste your time watching this even if it is offered free sometime..Incredibly bad.
5,Special Delivery,"Envy is the main emotion, out of a string of mixed emotions, that truly captured me after reading this amazing book. I found myself envious that i didnt have the imagination, experience and sheer brilliance to write this book myself.I was also left with the yearning to correspond with another in such a way, as did the characters Delphine and Jean-Luc.For a book lover like me this was the book i was looking for without knowing it.I read it within a day. I couldnt fail to take this book anywhere without a pen, purely so that i could underline phrases, sentences, and paragraphs that i loved throughout this book to re-read whenever i wish to be uplifted.I thoroughly loved reading this book, especially due to its surprise, and unfortunate ending.I would recommend it to anyone who wishes, or a few hours, to dissapear into a world that involves just you the reader,the characters and their wonderful journey."
5,Totally Cool!!!,"The morning I bought this cd,I was unsure of how good it would be.When it arrived,I put it in My cd player once and I can't stop singing.In my free time,I listen and sing to this c.d. It rocks!!"
3,It's OK but don't let the looks make the sale.,I purchased the knife on eBay for $10.00 less. It's a good looking knife and all but there are better knifes for the same or less money available. Fair design but not to swift on the release. Try a friends or have a salesman take one out of the package for you prior to your purchase and then put it side by side with a Gerber and you'll know what I mean. If your buying it as a collector then hey go for it. I mean it is purdy and all.
4,Blessed Through Words!,"Deborah,I am pleased to have had the opportunity to vast in the powerful words of your writing. You give perspective to overcoming and rising above obstacles that seem impossible. I am blessed daily through your eloquent flow of words. I will keep your book as a reference when I seek peace. Thanks for the abundance of scripture.May God continue to bless your gift of writing!Much Respect, Linda Washington-Johnson,Jackson Mississippi Readers Club Reviewer"
4,The Proper Care,"The Proper Care & Feeding of Your Soul is an EXCELLENT ""Self Help"" guide. It has enabled me to become a better person, sister, mother, daughter, and wife. It has given me the strength and courage to persevere through the difficult times in my life, and it has given me the comfort and peace to revel in God's grace. I now thank God for his blessings on a daily basis."
1,Crap.,"The book is weak and frankly common sense. Thinking of yourself as a product is far fetched, but plausible... And in the end I think the author is reaching. Here's a dating tip- get a cute dog and people will come up and talk to you constantly. The End.PS - Did anyone else notice that the reviews are totally fake? 5 - 5star reviews were written in the span of one week. Also the first enthusiastic review was written by someone who only wrote one review. My guess is the only real reviews are the one below with one star and mine - Amazon, please remove these fake reviews and give the book a 1 star average as it deserves."
4,moving and heartfelt,"Yes, this is a slim volume, and yes, a third of it comes from a Vanity Fair article, but it is also a tender and affectionate portrait of Stanley Kubrick well worth owning if you are an admirer of the filmmaker or a movie buff in general. Herr not only fills his books with amusing anecdotes about the famously reclusive director but also writes eloquently about the state of art and cinema in America. Although a bit defensive at times (particularly in assessing the merits of ""Eyes Wide Shut""), this book is a welcome departure from all the anti-Kubrick blather prevalent in the news media, which focus on his eccentric and paranoid side (much of which is untrue)."
2,"A sketch of Kubrick's personality, nothing more","Most books on Kubrick analyse his movies, rather than recount how he was. Michael Herr seemingly knew Kubrick well, so those who seek some traits of personality of the great filmmaker should be satisfied. But don't expect much. Herr mostly talked to Kubrick on the phone (or, rather - Kubrick talked to Herr).There are a few anecdotes, a kew quotations, and that's it."
3,Thin but pricey,"Much better than Raphael's memoir but still quite a disappointment. Merely a hundred pages of impressions, analyses and recallections. And all this for a hefty price. Be warned!"
3,Reprint of two Vanity Fair articles,"If you read the tremendous Vanity Fair articles written by Michael Herr on Kubrick, there is no real need to order this book. The book is merely the two articles in a bound volume."
3,80s man,"I love christmas music I love 80,s new wave music,. What a great fit. It is quite cheesy but it works for christmas music. It is a fun christmas album to play for friends and family."
2,"Enjoyable, but way too short!","Don't let the 10 songs fool you. The total running time of this cd is 22 minutes and 6 seconds. The songs are well done, and I like the cd, but, I really don't think it was worth the money, unless you have all of his other stuff, skip this one. =("
5,"Partners with the Sun: S.C. Photographers, 1840-1940","This is a well-researched, well-written book that contains a large amount of information about South Carolina's early daguerrotypists and photographers. A multitude of pictures, many representing archival material, illustrate the skills of these early artists of photography. The author also included letters and other biographical material revealing personal information about the sitters or photographers. Some of this material will be useful to those interested in genealogy, but to the rest of us it is a very readable and informative book, nicely printed and appointed."
3,Partners with the Sun,"This is a fairly extensive study of photographers working in the State of South Carolina during the period 1840-1940. The work will appeal to readers interested in the local history of South Carolina and the early history of photography in the South. It will also appeal to those studying the role of southern photography during the Civil War. The book is illustrated with numerous photographs taken from the collection of the author and other sources. These include carte de visites, cabinet cards, and stereo views. Unfortunately, the photographs are not full-page and the print quality is somewhat limited. As such, it may not satisfy readers who are looking for a ""fine-art"" monograph. In addition, although the work is well-documented, organized, and concise, it reads more like an academic thesis rather than a work of non-fiction. Partners with the Sun is not light reading. It is, however, an essential source of material for serious students of the history of photography."
1,"I,m very angry","I receive the cup but I don`t receive the Saucer.So I can`t use the cup because you cancle the Saucer order.I`m very angry with that, and I want you solve this."
3,Great watch...but short life span,"I love this watch. Looks great, the easy slip on clasp is great..no fumbling to put it on. Functions have always worked fine. Nice size digital numbers. BUT here's the only problem. It won't last more than two years. I have owned three of them. Each one broke at the same spot: one of the four main pin points where the band connects to the base of the watch. It's not the pin the breaks, but the actually female connecting socket where the pin goes into. So when that breaks, the watch is not fixable...it instantly become a pocket watch. So if you are OK with spending $35-$40 every couple years, then buy it."
5,A gentle perspective for families and professionals,Marvie's story encourages children to find ways to bond with those siblings who may approach the world a little differently. It shows children that differences are okay. I appreciate her efforts to explain a very difficult concept in a family friendly package. Thank you.
3,"Lose the mystery, lose the fear","Demystifying Grant Seeking is a very easy to read and understand approach to finding and applying for grants. It is especially helpful to those of us who are new to the process and have zero training in grant preparation. This book helps to eliminate some of the intimidation that the process holds for newbies, and provides a calm, clear set of steps to follow."
4,Unfinished Grain,"I was in the process of reading this eye opening book when my house burned down, my husband of 24 years left me and my life started over. It is an easy read and even lighlty humorous. We are all unfinished grain, as in wood, to be shaped into whatever we choose. Thank you for writing it."
5,Where has this cd set been???!,"This double-cd is the most phenomenal bargain out there!!! It has smooth groovin', hip jazzy cool beats throughout! You'll love it!!!"
3,Worth it,"$2 used for this CD? Don't waste a second if you love death metal at all. The vocals are nothing special but who cares, the music is pretty good."
5,A great book for young readers!,Patricia C. McKissack writes a book full of information and facts. She explains everything she says. You feel like you know Jesse Jackson after reading this book. Any one interested in the Civil Rights movment should read this book!
4,Goooooooood!!!!!,We love to make our own Custard and Moirs is the bestAs we remember from South AfricaThank you for bringing our home / memories back!!!
3,"Good phone, one complaint","In general this is a good phone; good sound quality, good range, good features. My only complaint is that the base unit doesn't have a Caller ID display - it only shows the number of messages on the answering machine. This is a real pain if the handset is away from the base unit and the phone rings (which is most of the time.)"
4,Good product good price,"product functions well, and looks good.If I could change one thing, the swivel action is just a little looser than I would like, but definatly not a problem."
2,Phone not the same as in photo,Not the same product as in the photo. Would not hold the phone in place.
2,Breaks really easy!,"The plastic breaks really easy on this clip. Mine has already fallen apart. It was great while it lasted, it just didn't last long....."
1,Poor Quality & Customer Service!,"This clip DOES NOT fit the LG VX8300. When I contacted the company to send me one that DOES fit, they sent me the EXACT same one that DOES NOT FIT the LG VX8300. DO NOT BUY!!"
1,Not for everyone,"Unfortunately this belt clip didn't hold up for me. Within a week the portion that holds the phone in broke--which was why we replaced the prior clip, but it held out for 1-1/2 years. We could tell there was a modification in style, even though it had the same item number. The phone doesn't snap in as securely as the prior model either."
4,One Church,"This was very well done! The songs have both a traditional gospel feel as well as a touch of classical music, very inovative."
4,great typing game,Great typing game especially if you love spongebob. My seven year old has learned quite a bit so far!
1,DECEPTIVE AD - NOT USEABLE ON MACS,"i researched this product on several websites, which all said ""works on mac"" as well as pc. even went to the manufacturers website too. but after recieving the product, in the fine print on the box it shows it only works on VERY OLD macs. with operating systems several versions back and badly outdated. our oldest mac in the house is a G4 from 1999 - AND IT WON'T WORK ON A 1999 MAC -- NEEDS OLDER VERSIONS. in this day of easy information access, i found nothing stating this on any website, including the manufacturer."
4,more practice,"We tried Typer Island (9yo kid) and being deserted on a island with a lousy typing game is child abuse. I read the reviews for SpongeBob and bought it! It was much better, but still a bit of a struggle. It advanced my child too fast during the lessons stating she had mastered keys at 100% accuracy but she was achieving only 8-10wpm (words per minute). The drills should be built into the lessons and associate mastering with specific levels of adjusted (accounts for errors) wpm. VERY IMPORTANT! Your child needs to ""play"" regularly, 4-5/week. Have your child review the previous lesson games while they move on to more lessons. The picture of the kyeboard during the lessons really help with the touch typing and keeping the eyes off the hands."
1,Disappointed,"Too much money for nothing. I remember that I bought other typing software when I was going to school and it was approximately 50% cheaper and more interesting although it was not for children. Also, it seems that the software had been stored for long time because it is not working properly. Therefore, I do not recommend the software for anyone. Look for something more interesting and cheaper."
5,fun typing,"When we upgraded computers we lost the ability to use the Disney's ""Adventures in Typing with Timon & Pumba."" It was the best typing game. My [..]could 10-finger type with an occasional peek at the keys. This SpongeBob has been a good substitute, my younger kids have enjoyed it, and that is the important thing with getting them to practice. Still want to know why Disney never came out with an upgrade to ""Timon and Pumba."""
3,PRETTY DECENT,"I'm reviewing this product for my ten year old daughter who says, ""She really likes it, but would like the simulated hands on the bottom (like Mavis Beacon)."" Other than that, it is a very fun and educational program."
3,They worked out ok,"These were barely long enough to fit, even though I went a size slightly larger than I normally would. I based my size on their own chart.I was hoping these were an opaque spandex. instead, they were more like a stretchy cotton. The fabric was uneven in density, so while it wasn't perfectly opaque, it was solid enough to hide flaws, razor stubble, etc.It looked fine. They worked fine, with no run for the one time I have worn them. Just not as high quality as I hoped."
3,"Excellent content, very dry style","The content of the book is excellent. The authors have created a compendium of the knowledge and behaviors needed for a manager to be successful. One would be hard-pressed to find this much of content in one volume, at the price this book is sold at.The bad news is that all of the content is in endless streams of paragraphs or bullet points. The total absence of a change in pace (no anecdotes, case studies, sidebars, pictures) makes this a very dry read. The book could be significantly enlivened by the addition of more diagrams that visually illustrate the principles being described.To make the best use of this material, learn to Mind Map (see Buzan's The Mind Mapping book). As you read through the material, distill the content into mind maps. Continually refer to those mind maps as you practice the behaviors suggested by the authors.In summary, the content is first-rate, the presentation is lacking."
5,"An in-depth, one-stop compendium","Now in an updated seventh edition, Successful Manager's Handbook is an in-depth, one-stop compendium packed with everything a manager absolutely must know. Written and compiled by Personnel Decisions International, a global human resources consulting firm specializing in building leadership talent, Successful Manager's Handbook is filled cover to cover with expert advice, from how to analyze issues and make sound, logical decisions to postively influencing others, fostering open communication, listen and write effectively, lead with courage, build trust, and much more. Point-by-point suggestions applicable to leaders of any scope in any field break down the most crucial concepts into easily accessible guidelines, and extensive lists of top-quality books and seminars offer further resources to pursue for tips, tricks, and techniques. Highly recommended."
5,Great Management Resource,"This book is the most practical book on the topic of employment that I have seen. It is helpful for first level and intermediate level management because it is simply written and covers practical topics. It is also a great resource for new college graduates or anyone new to the workplace. Use it to learn what your manager might be expecting of you. Topics include strategic thinking, change management, technology, customer service, leadership, human resources and more."
5,"President, Organization & Human Development","I have bought and used every edition of this book for development of managers/leaders including individual contributors over the years. It is the one book every manager needs on their desk, not to read from cover to cover, but for reference. It is the essential book for personal development, coaching, resume writing, job descriptions, training needs analysis, etc. Keep it on your desk,not in a drawer or on a bookshelf."
3,Bare bones version,"Kindle version is very bare bones, making it difficult to navigate; an index would have been VERY helpful. You're obligated to search through sections manually and it becomes tediousAGG"
5,Pretty good presentation.,"I was quite impressed with the book. I'm sure the first version was a little simpler, but this has alot to offer."
2,Too Trendy,"I cook traditional dishes, and I like to research recipes for elegant meals. This cookbook is filled with trendy recipes."
1,Stereotype after Stereotype,"Readers who have been waiting for Castillo's new book will be sadly disappointed. This book is poorly written and without a point. This is an endless barrage of stereotypes. I'm a Chicana and I don't know why I'm supposed to believe any of this. It reads like a bad telenovela. Castillo made absolutely no effort to make the characters sympathetic: the reader has no reason to admire or love any character in this book. After reading so much about the lives and experiences of these characters (especially the supposedly Latina Everywoman, Ella), I still finished the book not caring one bit about whether any of them continued to live or die, succeed or fail. This is hardly a recommendation and couching the book as a ""novel in verse"" does little to mask its flaws."
4,"""Night"" is better than ""Day"" but it can't touch ""Dawn"".","I often wonder what horror movies would be like had ""Night of the Living Dead"" never been made. ""Night of the Living Dead"" paved the way for all movies containing scenes of horrific gore and terrible spine tingling suspense. Since it was made in 1968, one should not expect to see the gorey effects of a modern day slaher flick, but still, you will not be dissapointed. Romero is a genius and this was the film that introduced Romero to the world. The reason I gave this movie only 4 stars is because it will never be anywhere as good as its sequel, ""Dawn of the Dead"". Its very rare that a sequel is better than the original, but keep in mind, this is Romero we are talking about, the man is a underrated genius. So if you watch ""Night of the Living Dead"" you will know that without it, we would never of seen ""Scream"" or any thing else that tries to be scary."
3,Little to no camera protection,"I bought this hoping it would protect my phone's camera lens and screen from scratches. Still no scratches, but most likely no thanks to this ""case."" The areas where the camera and screen are, are unprotected. I had to cut out and leave part of the protective plastic over the screen. Dumb.My least favorite part is, because I keep my phone in my pocket, and the plastic is raised and has seams, dust and lint builds up under the plastic, which means I have to remove the shell every couple weeks for a wipe-down, which stresses the plastic, which--well, breaks it.I'm not completely dissatisfied, mainly because I didn't have high hopes; you certainly get what you pay for--a cheap shell. I bought this five months ago, and the back already cracked and broke off, the front not far behind. About what I expected, minus any lens and screen protection."
1,A huge disappointment,"This may be a personal journey, but it is filled with shots and commentary about Rick Ray's family, packing, trouble keeping a sarong on and his baby's participation in a village ceremony. On the other side, he isa very critical of westerners, yet I found his lack of acurate facts about Bali, their spirituality and purpose inexcusable. One segment talked about the importance of dance in their culture - like Legong - but only showed school boys being taught the dance - no actual visuals of the legong, welcome or any other importance dance. I just returned from an extended stay in Bali and Rick Ray did not do the island and its people any great service with this video. I found it interesting that he put down tourists, but his video is mostly about him - quite arrogant."
5,An extraordinary work!,"I had the great pleasure of reading and using Diane Jacobs' ""Her Own Woman: The Life of Mary Wollstonecraft"" while researching and writing my recent biography, ""Theodosia Burr Alston: Portrait of a Prodigy (Corinthian Books, 2002). Vice President Aaron Burr, for all his flaws, was the first prominent American man to enthusiastically embrace and publicly endorse Wollstonectaft's radical feminist views on the equal education of women. He used her principles to give his teenage daughter, Theodosia, a ""man's education"" which would equip her for the three roles in life he envisioned for her: queen, president, or empress. I found Ms. Jacobs' work extremely insightful and enormously useful in understanding this woman who many cite as one of the first mothers of feminism. -- Richard N. Cté"
5,"PUBLISHER, PLEASE REPRINT!","Publisher, please reprint this book! ....I too have been searching for over a year for this book, at booksales, antique shows that have older print books, book search companies, and no luck. There's a demand for it, so why not reprint it?"
5,"Wonderful , basic veggie book and growing guide",I consider this book to be essential for anyone who likes their veggies and who grows them. There is too much covered in this book to mention. A perfect gift for the person who is growing food and eating well. Shippment was fast and the price if good too. I recommend this product.
5,Most Detailed Book on Neueoanatomy,"This book goes into detail on sensory integration, sensory perception, and tone. It is a perfect book for those who want to learn the fundamentals of neuroanatomy. It reads smooth and is very interesting, not like some books that are complicating and boring."
4,Quite entertaining with attractive talented cast.,"Good roles for Shannon Tweed and her sister Tracy, Andrew Stevens does double duty as star and director. Worth owning."
2,A Gay Diary Dissapoints,"I was very disappointed with this book. This is, ostensibly, the story of an interesting person (Donald Vining) in an interesting industry (theater) in an interesting place (Yale and New York City) in an interesting time (1930s and 1940s). But this book came across like reading someone's DayRunner. I did this...I did that. People surface and disappear with no explanation. There is no attempt to analyze or even really comment on anything that is mentioned in the text; be it a play, a famous director, the author's motives or even World War II. For instance, it would have been interesting to understand what formed the author's pacifist beliefs and what effect holding these beliefs had upon him, his family, his friends or his career."
2,Simply awful,"I quite agree with the other review - such a laborious read. If, however, you like reading the journals of over-fastidious queens, with an inflated view of their own literary worth, then this book is for you!"
2,The Crossing,being caught and sold as a salve.The story that I read is about mexican boy named manny who lives on the streets.Has to move every day from the fear of being caught and sold as a salve.In Manny's attempt to cross the U.S boardor he run into Robert.S.Locke. who ties to get away from his dead friend and finds it in cutty whisky. Manny ends finding his freedom to the U.S though him.Reveiw By Caroline.A.Farry
3,The crossing,"this was a good book to read. I enjoyed The Crossing, although the ending was sad I still recommend this book to ages 10-15 to read and enjoy."
2,the crossing by Gary Paulsen,"Eventhough I appreciated the book showing my child how fortunate he is, it was too dark."
4,Fast paced and exciting read.,Settings and characterizations are realistic and many readers will be able to identify with them.I have been searching for a novel for adult intermediate level ESL (English as a Second Language) students to read in less than four weeks. This fills the bill perfectly.
3,The Crossing by Gary Pulsen,"This book is about a boy named Manny Bustos. He is an orphan in Juarez Mexico. He lives on the street. He encounters many opsitcals to get to America. It is his dream to be free.This book is for kids about eleven or twelve, because it is a little confusing in some places. Atleast it was for me anyway. I hope youi enjow this book."
4,this is a great book,...the book the crossing is a great book by gary paulsen gary did a great job explaining things in his book i liked how he did not rpeat thing in the story and how he got right to the point. I think the age levelfor this book is probabley for ages 8 and up. this book is very easy to read and is only 114 pages long. I would recomend this book to anyone that wants to read a book that is short interesting and that is about a kid that is poor and live i a card board box and walks eeryday going place to place.
3,"Good, easy, fun to read book",I believed the book was pretty good. i liked how it had to do with a kid trying to better himself and escape from poverty as an orphan and start a new life in the USA. It helped give a good view on wat real friendship is suppose to be like. I would recommend this book to people who want a quick book to read and would just like to have it easy.
1,the crossing,one reason you sould read this book is it teaches you what it is like to be a kid to try to get to america. hes parents where unknow. he didnt remember themat all.when he was trying to get some money that people . but the older kids beat him up for all the money he had.if you want to find out the ending you have to read it for your self. iits a good book.
2,Not recommended,"I purchased the game due to the lack of choices for pc based bass fishing that run on Windows XP.The game made my entire PC crash.The graphics are out dated and game play is sad compared to a 3 year old EA Sports Bass Masters game. Bottem line, Keep looking."
1,NOT THE GAME ORDERED -RECV'D 1 BY PONDVIEW,"I CHOSE THE PRO BASS FISHING 2003 BY ATARI BECAUSE WE ENJOYED THE ATARI COMPUTER DEMO SO MUCH. THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT I WAS PURCHASING.INSTEAD, I RECEIVED AN ANCIENT VERSION OF BASS FISHING 3D (THE CASE SAID ""THE INTERNETS #1 SOURCE FOR FREE FULL VERSION SOFTWARE"") wHAT A WASTE OF MONEY AND A VERY MISLEADING REPRESENTATION, BY AN USING AN ATARI SOFTWARE BOX, AND DESCRIPTIONS TO SELL THIS BOGUS SOFTWARE."
5,Supper Game! Beter than being at the lake!,"Not only can you navigate, and fish from your bass boat on any one of many lakes. You see your bait, as it sinks to the bottom of the lake, and is reaeed in. The skill is reeling and jerking your line at just the right speed to hook a fish, and then aplying just the right amount of line tension to pull in your catch.<Don't confuse this game with Pro Bass Fishing, that was an earlier version by the same author, not nearly as good!Pro Bass Fishing 2003 is the game to get!"
1,RECONSIDER BUYING THIS CD--AWEFUL,i purchased this cd a week ago. i installed it--well half into installation it is saying i needed to go to the internet to download indeoxp which cost me another $15.00 to work the game.after all the installation i decided to play the game --all of a sudden the game caused the screen to go black & crash.i would have given a --0--but there is none.please reconsider wasting your money on this game--it is garbage & their tech support is as good as their game--no response with any help to fix this problem
1,Not Recommended,This is a poor quality simulation. The graphics look like they were generated by 3rd graders. It is not easy to play - is not user friendly. More control should be on the screen rather than the multitude of keyboard actions needed.
2,Calculus Re-mystified,"If you think calculus is a difficult subject, this book will only convince you further. This book may be good for someone trying to brush up on calculus skills, but for those trying to learn it for the first time, it will do nothing but confuse. If you want a more easy to follow introduction to calculus, try Silvanus P Thompson's 'Calculus Made Easy'"
1,DON'T BUY THIS BOOK!!!,"If there was any way to sue for publishing a book that is a complete lie from start to finish, this guy should be sued.I have never seen such a worthless book that advertises itself as the best secret on earth for learning calculus. I have been out of school for a number of years and bought this book based on its lies on the cover and introduction to brush up on calculus. It is now worth nothing more to me than firewood. The guy that wrote it must be a teacher in a leading university somewhere that has never had a job doing anything but boring students stupid.I can not begin to tell you how upset I am that I spent 1 dime on this book. It will make you more upset that you spent the time to read the introduction. You won't make it past chapter one before tosing it!!! Steven Krantz, go beary your head in the sand dude!!! Thats were it was when you wrote this piece of crap!!!"
1,Really terrible,"Needlessly and endless frustrating.The general pattern is this: a two-sentence overview - frequently introducing new terms without definition, then a demonstrative example with little textual explanation, followed by a ""you try it"" question that is markedly more complicated than the example and generally requiring knowledge beyond what is presented, all without the courtesy of furnishing the answer.Completely discouraging."
1,Demystify what?,"It does NOT demystify anything for me. It introduces new notation, new concepts and DOES NOT explain them. eg, it introduces the Derivative in 1 line without any explanation - somehow Lim x-> 0 (f(c+h)-f(c))/h relates to f(x)=x^2+x because in 2 lines it shows that because a limit can be calculated for the former at a value means that a derivative of the latter can be found with the same value. Sorry, not demystified here - how does the former even relate to the latter? An explanation of that would demystify."
1,Horrible Book,I bought this book so I could quickly review calculus concepts and get new insights. It offered neither. The book offered new concepts with no exploitation or reason. This book fails miserably. Reviewing Stewart's or Larson's Calculus text are much easier and faster.
1,Editors? Found two mistakes already and am not on Ch 3,"One would think a big book company like McGraw-Hill would have editors, proofreaders, and careful professors. Here is my main problem: there are mathematical errors (two wrong answers within chapter 2). I verified my answers with an independent source. How am I supposed to learn from a book when I am not sure what is correct and what is incorrect? Not sure if I am going to move on to chapter 3."
1,Avoid this book,"I think all you need to know about this book is the intro to limits. Why not use a simple continuous function with a single definition to introduce the idea? What can possibly come from using a function that has different definitions depending on the range of x, except adding an unnecessary detail for the reader to weed through? It almost seems that the author is intentionally making it sound complicated to convice the reader that he (the author) is so brilliant that he (the author) can't understand how the reader isn't able to connect the dots, which he (the author) has made unnecessarily difficult to connect.Examples of this unnecessary obfuscation is found in spades in this book."
1,A self-teaching guide it isn't...,"I had bought this book mostly by the claims on its cover--namely that of being a self-teaching guide. I want to learn calc, but I can see my 5-minute thumb through of the book before buying wasn't long enough.As other reviewers have said, there are 'you try it' problems with no answers to check, but I figured that was because I was still on chapter 1.I'm going to ditch this book and get PreCalc demystified and Calc for Dummies instead."
4,Beautiful & intimate,I bought this book to broaden my partner options for public classes & found just a few things I could use. But for deepening a relationship this is fabulous!I wished I had known how intimate the sequences were before buying
4,Almost overwhelming!,"We're loving this book, though it is almost overwhelming it's so packed full of information, asanas, and sets of positions. We've actually been having a hard time putting together series, if only because you turn the page and BAM, here's even MORE you can integrate. What happens is that we either wind up sitting on the floor looking at the book and having a rather disjointed partner yoga session, or we just pick a couple of things at random and attempt to integrate them into a growing routine, because it seems near impossible to try and remember it all without looking, and looking again. Information-wise, it's my favorite partner yoga book out there right now, because it's chock-full, but we've got to figure out a better way to put it to use!"
5,Partner Yoga Book,The book is so helpful! Pictures and word descriptions are really helpful. As a yoga novice this book helps me a lot and makes my friends think I actually know what I'm doing!
3,Good but there are better books for the cost,"This is a good book for 4th - 6th grade children. I'm a 5th grade teacher (and a big astronomy fan). We have this book at our school. It has some nice pictures and information, but the price is too high compared to other books about the universe that contain better pictures and more information. For example I prefer The Reader's Digest Children's Atlas of the Universe. I've read it. It's a much better book. It has much more information, ideas, etc. I haven't read, but I am thinking of getting the DK Space Encyclopedia. It looks good too. I'd recommend either of these books first."
1,You must be kidding,"One of the most painful books I have ever read. Not just badly written, it actually causes you pain to read it. Maybe that was the english experience the author was trying to convey, absolutely nothing else. This book cost me .50 at a used book store. I like the title, but you would have a better time banging your head against the wall. There are two people selling this book, they must be his cousins, mine helped heat my house."
1,*very* disappointed in this magazine and BSA,"This is my 9 yos first year of Cub Scouts (Webelos), and we were all very excited for this new opportunity. I went ahead and ordered Boys Life when I registered my son for scouts, looking forward to a monthly magazine that would reinforce the Scout values. I am very, very disappointed. The amount of advertising is disturbing. It seems that for every 1-2 pages of content there is an equal (if not more) amount of advertising. The few articles that I've read have been interesting, but not at the expense of over-exposure to pop culture and media. Shame on you, BSA, for failing to reinforce the values that your organization promotes during den and pack meetings. One look at this magazine, and the values I see promoted are consumerism and video gaming. This will be the last year that I waste $24 on this magazine."
1,Lame,"Back in the 1980's, yours truly was a husky lad, squeezing himself into his trusty Scout uniform. Want to keep up on the latest in Scouting? Well, read Boys' Life! It had some fine features on Scouting, and some really awful, not even close to funny cartoons featuring ""Pedro"" the burro, and ""Dink and Duff"". ...my Dad bought me a subscription, and I thought it was quite lame. Fast forward to 2004: What is keeping this magazine alive? It is so anemic, so fluffy. I guess the dumbing down started by ""Maxim"" has even affected a G-rated kids' magazine. It still has ""Pedro"" and ""Dink and Duff"", but not much else. It was awful then, and even worse now. Were kids ever innocent enough to enjoy this?"
3,"Well-crafted, but only on its own terms","I have to confess, I had not expected this book to be anything like it turned out to be. I was hoping that it would be a comedy slant on the trauma my mistress and I experienced following her botched surgical enhancement (a word to the wise: only go to reputable surgeons who use real silicon - plasticine is never likely to work). Whilst it wasn't that, it did divert me from the constant earache she was giving me over the matter, and ultimately gave me the chance I needed to suggest that we should go our separate ways."
5,A great resource on Harold Lloyd,"Harold Lloyd (1893-1971) was one of the greatest Silent Film Era actors, ranked right up with Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton. This 2002 book was written by a noted author and film historian, and Mr. Lloyd's beloved granddaughter. It starts out with a very well written biography of the great actor, and then slips into the crowning glory of the book, an in-depth look at each of his feature-length movies. Finally, there is a chapter by Suzanne Lloyd in which she reminisces about her years spent growing up with Harold. Along the way, the reader is treated to many excellent black-and-white pictures.This is a truly excellent book, and a great resource on Harold Lloyd. The authors did a great job of giving the reader a lot of depth on Mr. Lloyd, the man and the actor. I really enjoyed this book, and highly recommend it to anyone interested in the great man!"
1,A sham,"I just watched Lloyd's granddaughter on television talking about this book during the talk about the famous ""clock hanging"" scene in ""Safety Last."" The family member took the skewed point of view and mentioned about how all the ""harrowing stuntwork"" was doine by Lloyd himself, leaving out the contributions of the great stuntman Harvey Peary! Something that Hollywood officianados know. This book is another example of a relative trying to re-write Hollywood history.A shame that one cannot be satisfied of the actual work of a great man, but must feel the need to lie."
3,Jepthe/Jonah Recording Review,"Having studied and conducted both of these beautiful Carissimi oratorios, this performance is marred by faulty intonation among the soloists and chorus, and very minimal, generally uninspired ornamentation of the vocal lines. Indeed, the usually gorgeous closing chorus of ""Jepthe"" is labored and heavy, and several tempi in both works fail to reflect the drama of the text. While the orchestra performed better than the soloists and chorus, in this day when many questions of performance practice have been standardized in period instrument performances and recordings, I expected much better of any choral group bearing the ""Oxford"" name. This CD does give the listener a good idea of what these oratorios sound like, but these are not stellar performances."
1,Wow is this bad,"Gotta say I love the whole Twilight saga, books and movies. Not to say I don't enjoy poking at things too. This didn't even come close to humor. The fact that the Jersey Shore crew was referenced should have warned me. A couple of chuckles but my money and the time I spent watching it tacked back on to my lifetime would be greatly appreciated."
2,MY GRADE: C plus.,"This is a total parody on the TWILIGHT series so if you haven't watched any of them you will miss a lot of references. That said, the humor is below par so you aren't missing that much. I appreciated the attempt even though it wasn't as amusing. Lot of missed potential.HUMOR: C; STORY/PLOTTING: C plus; CHARACTER ARCHETYPES: B minus; GETS TWILIGHT TO DO THE PARODY: B minus to B; WHEN WATCHED: early May 2012; OVERALL GRADE: C plus."
4,"Funny, at times, tries too hard","If you like this type of satire, it's pretty good. As a fan of both the books and movies, I just had to see this :)Am glad I did, but because 'satire' is not my favorite genre, I'll pass this along to others to laugh at too.As a rule I do not review books and movies (always afraid to spoil / give something away - and just because I like or don't like something doesn't mean you won't love or hate it - right?I am glad I bought it and saw it, and did laugh in many places, and laughed with my wife who was ""rolling her eyes"" a lot.../snickerOne little tip - the young lady in the role of (who would be) Bella - really did try to use some of her mannerisms - which made it so very silly and funny~!Call me slow - I did not get about 20% of the gags - oh well, that's pretty good for me :)Yes, I would buy it again..."
5,excellent movie!!,"I totally enjoyed the movie... and I mean totally...because the movie was in excellent conditions, very high-definition, and arrived on time."
3,Vampires Suck Review,"So I was very disappointing in this movie. The trailers they have for this movie are more entertaining and promising than the movie actually was. I think it is worth watching at least once for fans of Twilight, but definitely not worth owning."
3,Caught up in Twilight so had to see the spoof,kinda funny but watch it once and pass it on It is better to rent or let someone pass on to you
3,We had high hopes for this Vampire movie but......,This movie we had high hopes for and had wanted to see for awhile was very disappointig... The only funny parts were the ones that were in the trailer and there was only about 3 did not find this movie funny and entertaining as we had hoped...
4,So funny,"This movie is such a great parody of Twilight it hurts. Dancing werewolves that turn into chihuahuas, silly vamps over-acting and eating ice cream, plus the graduating scene. And the ending was very... unexpected. You just have to see it. Funny movie to watch but don't bother buying because you won't watch it more than once.Team Shovel!"
4,Vampires Suck!,"I saw this movie at the cinema with my daughter...It was stupid, but hilarious..We laughed most of the way through it....Some parts are the way Twilight should have been...not silly...but still similiar....I like the Twilight books and movies..although. i think the movies could have been better with a good Director and Bella especially, having coaching lessons on how to cry etc....But overall this was really funny..."
3,better than the average funny spoof,"""Vampires Suck"" is a highly enjoyable spoof of the ""Twilight"" Saga that takes on the ridiculousness of that teen vampire franchise. The movie is surprisingly enjoyable even to someone who hasn't seen the movies but has read all four Twilight books. There are several on-point jokes about the current cultural phenomenon like the Kardashians, vampires, and celebrities on Twitter, among others. It's worth watching the 76-minute movie if for nothing else than to see the ending."
1,AWFUL!!!,"Let me start off by saying, no one could possibly be more annoyed by Twilight than I. I fully support the utter mockery of the series as much as the last guy. But this was a pathetically stupid movie. There was a complete lack of creativity and ingenuity put into this film. The mockery of the twilight series requires so much more. This movie was pathetic. It insults those who despise Twilight more than it insults the actual series. The humor was dry, tasteless, and all around stupid. But not the ha-ha kind of stupid. The kind of stupid that makes you want to puke. Awful movie.I seriously hope a better Twilight parody comes out. Twilight has caused me and many other boyfriends pain beyond comprehension. It deserves to be mocked. And it deserves to be mocked with skill."
1,DON'T WATCH THIS MOVIE. YOU'LL REGRET IT!,This is the worst movie I've ever seen. It was so disjointed and hard to follow. It was nothing but a series of spoofs from different scenes. I want the hour and 10 minutes I wasted on it back.
1,I gave this one star because they don't have a zero stars,"very slow, predictable jokes, poor acting, and plodding pace make this one a dust collector. Don't waste the money. Yuck"
1,Pretty much sucks and blows for me,"I caught this movie on HBO, and it was really gross, and not at all funny for me. Maybe some people enjoy disgusting sexual jokes, and anti-parental attitudes, but not to this extreme. I am a fan of Twilight, and think the books and films are beautifully done, but I also have a sense of humor. I do not not mind spoofs, but I believe there is a certain limit on how far you can go. I am not old, heck, I am in my early twenties, but rest assure, I just do not find this movie funny or tasteful. The only tiny micro-second scene that I like was when Jacob(Who cannot hold a candle to Lautner)shifted into a chihuahua. This is only because I love the breed, and have one of my own. The Simpsons have been making parodies and spoofs since '87, and only one of the hundreds of episodes was not funny. And it was not the Twilight one if you are asking.Overall, do not waste your time on this film."
1,Not funny,"There were only 2 or 3 funny scenes. For example, the scene where the guy supposedly turned into a wolf but he became a Chihuahua instead. After those scenes, the dialogues and the plot made me sleepy.At least the set looked very much like the one in Twilight movies.In short, this film sucks."
3,Vampire Sucks,Well done campy spoof of a ridiculous movie. Enjoyable and great for laughs. The scenes are better retold in conversation later when shared with a friend.
5,I hate the twilight saga!!!! This movie is awesome!!!,This movie is awesome!!!! i hate the twilight saga and this is why i love this movie!!!!!! the best parody ever!!!!! wuju!!
2,Not as good as other parody's,"I remember when I first saw the commercials to this movie and I just knew me and my friends were going to watch it and lol the entire time. When it came to theaters i missed it in my small little town so i waited for it to come on DVD. To my disappointment this movie was not that funny. I had a chuckle here and there to the references to Tiger woods, Letters to john, and flavor flave. but never a laugh out loud movie. When i got to 30 min into the movie it was becoming a pain to keep watching it, so i ended up just turning it off and i dont even know if i will watch it again. I am a boy and i dont rlly love twilight but i liked watching eclipse way more than watching this piece of junk"
4,Vampires Suck really didn't,"I watched this movie with my two granddaughters ages 13 and 14. They guffawed all the way through and they are Twilight fans to the max. I laughed quite often as I have seen the three Twilight movies also. It really wasn't bad. The actress who played ""Becca"" had Kristen Stewart down pat. Your teens will love it. It is worth the time to watch it."
1,Extremly stupid,"This movie is so stupid! it's a little funny with it's sarcastic refrences, but i really wouldn't bet on this one to be a blockbuster. this movie is so stupid it has even ""Strange Brew"" beat on that scale. Although Jenn Proske does has Kristen Stewert's stutter, lip bite, & trembling down to a ""T"". so i've got to give her Props for that. But for all of that i really don't think i'll be shelling out the $20 to buy it when it comes out on DVD."
1,"this movie ""bites""",this movie would only let me watch the trailer. so after 7 times of watching the trailer i decided to give up and wright a review to worn people. DO NOT buy or rent this movie your waisting your time and money on a stupid trailer that your stuck with . when it says vampires SUCK its just givin you a glimps of the future.
2,Disappointed,"I love the Twilight Saga and my family and I were really looking forward to seeing the parody. I had heard bad reviews, but decided to make up my own mind. Not only was it in bad taste, it was not very funny at all. I think I probably laughed out loud *once* during the movie (when Bella wakes up to find Edward in her room with his hair in rollers, bleaching his teeth). It's not appropriate for tweens, really either because of the gross sexual humor. I usually don't mind a few swear words if the movie is funny, but this wasn't. I wouldn't recommend it."
1,It just Sucks!,"3 funny moments that are forgotten in a storm of third grade humor. It doesn't even deserve a courtesy laugh. This movie needs a whole new review category - Instead of one to five stars, how about one to five vomits? This movie is definitely worthy of five vomits. You should be paid to have to watch it."
2,Vampires,To much sex. It needs to come with a better parental warning. thank God I watched it first and made a decision. Bad movie people. Im sure they could have done a better job without all the sex stuff
3,Had potential...,"This movie had potential. It was overall funny, but they overdid it with being to ""stupid"" at parts. Example: the Bella baby carrier, and some parts that were over the line sexually charged. Younger kids are going to watch this, and it ""sucks"" that that's what they're going to see. Can you say ""welcome to desensitizing our youth""? Then again, crude humor isn't my cup of tea... I like more suttle / smart humor like in ""the Office"", ""The Daily Show"", ""The Colbert Report"", ect. Although not big on the out-there-in-your-face vulager humor, I do think shows like South Park are funny. Just trying to point out that even though it may not be what I like, it may be what someone else finds funny."
3,Review of this doucumentary Footsteps of Goliath,I found it very informative about the bibical giant. The only thing I thought they should had more of the battle between david and goliath. To all who want to see that battle dvd David and Bethsheba is the battle almost at the end of the motion picture you would want to get.
3,Must have LONG hair!,"The depth of the curve in the waver plate is so deep, it won't work well on hair that is shorter than five inches. If you use it on on shorter lengths, i.e. if you have layers where the hair is cut at different lengths usually shorter on the crown/sides and longer in the back, the top part comes out looking like a bad perm.Other than that, the waver creates the perfect ""S"" curl/finger wave on longer hair.The temperature dial has many different settings in between low and high, however it has no numbers on it, so you're never quite sure if it's on the middle setting.For those of you who are used to using crimping and flat irons, the waver plates on the Vidal Sassoon waver are not shielded on the outer part of the top and bottom plates, so you can burn your hands, fingers and ears easily. This makes it very difficult to use on your own."
5,10 Stars is not enough,"This is my favorite book of all time... beautiful, deep, touching poetry... I usually buy 10 copies , as it goes out of print from time to time.. and my friends keep taking mine... down to two now...if you like, zen... and nature... you'll love this"
3,Too focused on Ryokan's melancholy moments,"Although this translation has been in my library since the 70's, I have always wondered why it seemed largely a picture of a very sad Ryokan for the most part. I had a feeling that this was not the whole picture, and it turns out that it is not. Please consider also reading ""Sky Above, Great Wind"" by Kazuaki Tanahashi for a much, much bigger presentation of who Ryokan was."
2,Not as great as I expected,"I wanted to love this product. I knew I had to be careful choosing a hydrating mask because I have oily skin so I thought this H2O mask was perfect to get me through the winter months. The consistency is pretty thick, similar to a lotion. The scent is pleasant. Even though I left the mask on for the recommend amount of time, it just felt like it was sitting on top of my skin-not really getting absorbed at all. After several uses and nearly finishing the tube, I haven't noticed any difference in my skin. I think this product is seriously overpriced and ineffective."
5,Excellent Product,"This is a wonderful product. It hydrates beautifully, besides, H2O Plus products are all A+. So get it without hesitation."
3,It's okay as a reference.,"I love reading about conspiracy theories, but I don't happen to buy into most of them. The authors of this book, however, seem to believe most of what they write about. I could be mistaken, but they do claim their book is supposed to be ""objective"", and intended to let the audience make their own decisions. But from what I can tell, I do think it leads the reader.Anyway, as a reference, it's a great book. You can find so much in here. If that is why you got this book, which was my reason, then you'll be able to enjoy it."
3,Eh.........,"Pretty basic stuff in this book. Anyone remotely interested in conspiracy theories will not be stunned by any of the allegations in this book. All of it is pretty basic with nothing new. As far as the secret societies go, most of them are extremely old and no longer in existence. The rest are pretty much a bunch of low end radicals with a few followers. Unfortunately, I was disappointed with the content of this book."
2,Stupid me. I don't know how I got this mixed up.,I'm very unhappy because I thought I bought a paper back book. I got confused that I bought it to read to on here. That the only thing I'm in happy with.
5,Sweet gameplay,There are many fighting games that ive played including mortal kombat and street fighter but tekken is so much better. THhere are so many characters u can get and to many moves. The movies after u beat the boss with different characters are cool too.I personally think this is the best playstation game they have come up with yet
4,The Great Tekken Three!,"My name is Tony Gregory, and I think Tekken Three is a fantastic game. This game is a thrilling trilligy for all ages, ang great action for 68 hours.Ogre is my favorite character because his flames makes him invinsible.And my second best favorite is Brian because he can suvive survival mode and time attack mode.I hoped you like the fantastic Tekken Three"
5,Fabulous PS1 action,"I first played this game at an arcade at a ski lodge........I didn't go skiing that afternoon.I immediately purchased it after I got my PS1, and it captured me. I must say it is a fine piece of martial arts work. Totally get this game or at least try it. It is a great improvement from its predecessors. If you didn't like those 2, just loooook at thiiiiis. It is niiiiiiiiice. Try iiiiiiiit."
3,"It's really a solid game, it just get's old fast...","You know those games that the magazines all say is cool and your friends tell you about and it's the talk of the year, and when you buy it it's great, but your playing something else in a week. I think Tekken 3 is one of those games. I'll be honest, the game itself is fun, but repetative. You'll soon find that all of the characters and levels never change, and the Tekken Force mode does very little to improve. It, just like the game, gets old. I guarantee you will play the game all the way through just to unlock all the player videos though. If you can get the game used and VERY cheap, buy it. It's a fine game for a while, but nothing you'll play for years."
5,One of the greatest fighting games of all time,"This game's got almost everything a perfect game needs - great graphics (for the playstation)and great fun gameplay. The music though is so-so, but not so bad. There are alot of great features in this game such as arcade, tekken force, vs., tekken ball (has to be unlocked), and group battle mode. They're all fun and addictive. The graphics are great (even the backgrounds), movies have amazing 3-d quality.This game is a must-have for all fans of the fighting genre and people who just like great games. No wonder Tekken 3 is one of the greatest hits of playstation."
2,3rd time is not a charm,"this game should bow down to its ancestor, tekken 2. the fighting and backgounds are 2D. the last guy is way too easy to beat. force mode looks like a game from super nes. i hope tekken 4 is a vast improvement."
1,NAMCO TRIED BUT THEY STILL FAILED.,this game is the worse since tobal 2. i mean the arcade mode you get to fight a few people and the bosses that man i cannot spell his name and the next one oh yes ogre they are easy to beat. then the character endings are pointless and cheap. teeken and tobal stinks. i don't see why everyone is rating this game so high they must be love boring games with cheap endings and easy bosses and a handfull of people. i got this game and i sold it and bought street fighter ex2 plus instead.
4,Good arcade Game,"Fun arcade game, Good to play with friends. graphics are typical psx, don't expect too much. takes a couple hours per character to learn their special moves. Fun. over all 4 stars."
5,This is the best!,"This is one of the best fighting games I've ever played (with the exception of Soul Blade, atleast I think thats the name.) The combos in this game are really exciting and cool looking with one exception, if your not good at learning combos and memorizing the buttons then your gonna have a hard time pulling off combos since you have to remember a long list of buttons and when to press them in sinc."
3,Fun for the button masher,This game will satisfy all the Tekken fans of the past. Button mashing galore. I didn't find it that satisfying. We unlocked all of the characters and beat the game. What more was there to do?
5,Still Fun After 2 Years..,"I've had Tekken 3 for two years now and I still love playing it, mainly because it is one of the best PS1 fighters ever made.Reasons why this is a great game are simple:There are tons of great characters from Yoshimitsu, the ever cute dragon Gon, the sexy schoolgirl Ling Xiaoyu, and over a dozen more. The wonderful part is they all have their own unique fighting styles which keeps the action from getting dull.With mulitple game modes this also adds to Tekkens variety and level of fun. Tekken Force mode puts the characters into a side scrolling action game. Although, my fave is Tekken Ball which is a wierd mix of fighting and volleyball. I know what you're thinking, but trust me, it's fun.The game is a little hard at first, but give it a week or so and you will get it down pact.With all the unlockable characters, modes and costumes, it will keep you entertained for weeks to come. That and being one of the most comprehensive fighters out there makes it a must have."
5,Great graphics and good sounds !,"Tekken 3 is great! 3D graphics are of high quality. Sounds are realistic and the stereo music is awesome. There are lots of interesting options. One small ""but"": some of the characters are a bit slow, especially when you are used to playing Streetfighter games on ""a competitive system""."
4,"GOOD, BUT A LITTLE OVERRATED","THIS GAME WAS GREAT, AS A MATTER OF FACT, BUT IT'S NOT ALL THAT PEOPLE SAY IT IS. THERE'S SOME NEW CHARACTERS ADDED TO THE GAME AND THE CHARACTERS FROM THE FIRST 2 GAMES HAVE ALL GOTTEN OLDER. THE FIGHTS ARE GREAT, THE NEW AND INVENTIVE MODES [SUCH AS THE ONE WHERE YOU FIGHT OFF GANGS AND STUFF LIKE THAT ON DIFFERENT STAGES] ARE GOOD, AND THE CHARACTERS ARE ALL FUN AND EASY TO USE. TEKKEN FANS WILL LOVE THIS ONE A LOT."
3,So-So,"Okay, Tekken 3 isn't too bad or too good either. You fight on a rotating block that is uh...boring. Pretty cool combos and people. I like King the best. Some people cuss when they get hit and the graphics are pretty fine if you ask me. Wasn't an overall bore or an overall excitement. It was smack dab in the middle."
4,You're an idiot if you haven't bought this,"This ismy favorite fighting game on my P.S. and I should say that I still don'get bored with it...The graphics are obviously developed,, you could notice the polygons are smaller and the characters are more realistic...Although there are bizarre characters (such as Gon, the little dinosaur, they add the fun to this game even though I don't use them that much..Namco should create more of this stuff."
3,fun but simple not any cheatcodes,I like this game but there are not many cheats and it gets old quick but if you want a thrill buy it.
1,"Boring for a 9 year old, and outright wrong","My 9 year old son was bored stiff by this. It doesn't scale well from inexperienced to experienced, so an experienced reader is doing very simple things getting bored. I'd say it caps out at 6 or 7 year old audience.Worst problem is that there are some incorrect answers. The one where it asks you to click on a picture with a given short vowel sound was the most frustrating. Apparently a dog does not have a short 'o' sound, and either rain or a tie must have a short 'i' sound in them according to the program.Then again, maybe I'm just the poor reader here and should trust the experts."
4,A variety of resources in a convenient format.,"It is nice to have all of the resources in the book collected into one place.It is true that you can find almost all of the information on the net, and some of it is pretty basic, but to have it summerized in one spot is nice. There are also a lot of sites you wouldn't want to miss.This book gets straight to the point and covers a lot of ground, but does not elaborate much and leaves this to the pages it points to. The advanced net user will probably be left with a feeling that something is missing."
1,HOW YOU CAN GO BROKE ACCESSING THE FACTS.,"Any moron can find these free search engines.If your looking to ""spy"" on someone you had betterbring your wallet. All of the informative publicrecords search sites come with hefty prices.This book is just a giant advertisement for these sites. And don't let the size fool you. If you can't read this book in less than 30 minutes, might I suggest ""Green Eggs and Ham""? Next time I will read the reviews before I buy. DU!"
2,Informative but not worth buying,"This book deserves a one-time run through for its interesting information, however, after the first perusal, it probably won't be taken off the shelf again. My best suggestion is to find a copy of it (or of a similar text) in the library"
2,Your Personal Netspy,"I was astonished to learn that the publication date for this book is 1996. In computer years, that's before the last ice age. I have a copy of the last edition, that is, the 1996 edition, and I give it a 2 because even though many of the procedures, URLs, and links are dead, dead, dead, the few that are still active are, indeed, useful. And the book does get you thinking.The cover offers ""FREE UPDATES AT WWW.YPN.COM."" And updates certainly are due, free or otherwise, but if you try to get any from this URL, you'll get a sorta suprize.I learned this by trying to get a newer edition. So far, no dice. Rudy B."
5,Great up and coming group,"Saw this group at Warp Tour this year and have to say they definitely put on an amazing show! One of the highlights of the day that had everyone talking and saying these guys are gonna be big soon. About a week after that, a local radio station was playing one of their songs, ""Until the Day I Die"" (excellent song by the way) in a tribute to the tour. If you like groups like Finch, you'll love Story of the Year. Lyrics are awesome and the music is just... well, ya gotta hear it! You'll for sure be hearing all about them soon!"
5,Hell yeah,BigBlueMonkey simply kicks ass. Just because they have a new name doesnt change a thing. they still rock harder than anyother band out there today.Get BigBlueMonkey and Page Avenue~-janie-
5,Kick [...] punk rock,"I saw these guys live when the opened for Goldfinger last year. They were extremely impressive, so I bought this EP from Adam (the bass player) for a measly [$$$], which was worth it for sure. [...]P>Anyway, on to the music: this cd is lyrically very good, with lyrics that I can really identify with, like escaping a small town (when I give you the finger you're already dead to me, do you really think you matter? that's the story of the year).Do yourself a favor and check them out."
5,Tribal Bible,"The Tribal Bible is just what the title says it is, a comprehensive guide to American Tribal Style Belly Dance. This book is great as a beginners introduction to basic moves as well as loads of information on the origins, costuming, make up, attitude and evolution of ATS. It even has explanations on how to make your own costumes. It does not replace classes, but, augments them. The Tribal Bible is a ""must have"" for all ATS belly dancers"
3,One Good Tune Redeems A Lot,"The only melody of the opera worth hearing is the third scene of Act II. It is called ""The Patients' Prayer."" The only other case I can think of where one finds one gem in an otherwise musically-dull opera is Korngold's ""Die tote Stadt."" Petitgitard was no Korngold.The words of the prayer reflect the somber plot and can easily stand on their own: (See Youtube.)""Behold, Lord, your humble servant on his bed of suffering. Restore the soul's strength, as you created it, and make it so that, fortified, by trials, it may become healed by your grace. May all the demons of this place flee with their ill-will. And may the angels of peace keep watch. My God, restore his health. For in you has he placed his hope. On his bed of suffering, O Lord, deign to come to him. Restore his health. And may he enter your holy church to thank you. O Lord, may your hand give him back his strength...""""Pity me, Lord! My bones are jumbled. My soul is jumbled. Pity me, Lord. I have no strength."""
1,Poor quality,This turntable barely spins without anything on it. Add any items and it is totally useless as a turntable. The return policy is OK but it's going to cost me $10 to return a $20 item - don't bother buying this.
1,Spanish translation problems,"George Eliot's classic Silas Marner not the subject of this review, but rather the Spanish translation of that book. Somewhere in the trip from English to Spanish, all of the letters with accents and tildes are dropped. You would think it would print the english equivalent without the accent, but it actually omits the letter. This, none the less, makes for some interesting reading. If you are fairly advanced in you Spanish reading, or a native speaker, you can probably read right through it. But if you have to work at your reading in Spanish, this version will throw you for a loop. This is the version that shows up in a plain green and gray cover. I haven't checked out the other Spanish Edition versions."
3,Silas Marner...?,"So the story begins with this hermit of a man living (but at the same time not living) in the little town of Raveloe, but is not exactly there by choice. He was betrayed and framed by his best friend and lost his fiance to that same so-called friend. This gloomy and depressing beginning leads to a wonderfully happy ending. Sound familiar? Yes, Silas Marner is one of those ""everything works out"" kind of books, but in this case does that make it good? Well yes. Is it still interesting? Yes it is. Was it a page turner? Not exactly, but it reading it wasn't a waste of time. George Eliot's style is nothing short of classic. The character flaws are perfectly calculated especially with the character Godfrey whose mistakes add irony and slight comedy to the piece. This book comes short of perfect but it has comedy, death, betrayal, happiness, and a cohesiveness that is admirable."
3,Goddess Kali,The plastic prongs that hold in the dvds - 2 were broken and the dvds were loose in the box and 3 of the dvds were scratched. I tested them in the dvd player and they played so I didn't send them back. This series is really good.
5,"Keeping The Wife Happy, Hercules, season 5&6",I bought this item for my wife. She has the whole series and watches it from begining to end and than starts over again. She is pleased with the quality of the movies. We are happy with the cost.
3,wrong test question answers,"Be warned that many of the questions at the end of this book come with the wrong answers. Having the wrong answers can steer you in the wrong direction if using to study for the RNC. Check the ones you think are incorrect. It is driving me crazy and makes me question a lot of the information in this book. Basically, don't rely on just the test questions in the back. I really hope they are going to fix this in editions to come."
3,Perinatal Nursing,"It is somewhat hard to keep a focus as the text refers to many studies. I like plain and simple language I can understand and not all the ""study"" statistics!!"
2,Too much theory!,"I've been a nurse for four years with three years of L&D;/antenatal experience. I decided to take the RNC-OB exam and bought this book to brush up on my knowledge. I read about 5 chapters and just couldn't take it any longer. There's way too much theory and not enough technical information. The material was hard to grasp and even harder to learn/memorize. I turned to a friend who had recently passed her RNC board and she suggested:Intrapartum Management Modules: A Perinatal Education Program (Martin, Intrapartum Management Modules)I would also suggest reading another reference regarding neonatal knowledge and taking a few practice exams."
2,A horse designed by a committee,"This book is written by about two dozen people. Everyone writes one chapter. Unfortunatley, each writer spends about half the chapter giving their view of GPRS instead of providing useful information.You expect this from most books but most single author will do it for about 2 chapters in the beginning and he will have to get down to business. If you add up the useless information in each chapter, it probably takes up about half the book. Truely ""A horse designed by a committee"""
5,This Book Is Fantastic!,"I loved it! It has just the right mixture of romance, self-sacrifice, and hair-raising parts to be absolutely perfect! I am a die-hard Tolkien fan, but I would definitely put this book on the same level as his work. It was very well done! A great read for children and adults alike."
3,By These Ten Bones,"Maddie is a young girl living in the Scottish highlands. Cut off from almost everything. So, it's no surprise when wood carver Paul comes to town that she is taken with him at first sight. But then things take a turn for the worse. Maddie doesn't know what to do, and she has a hard decision ahead. A way to push back the shadow and save the people she loves...By These Ten Bones was a dark and chilling tale. I loved that it took place in Scotland. Also the lead characters Maddie and Paul were intriguing. For the most part the story was enjoyable but, I had trouble reading this one it was just a bit too dark for my taste. I do think this book will appeal to a lot of readers, especially werewolf fans.3 Stars = good read"
2,disappointing,"This reads like a first novel, too choppy and vague for my taste. Dunkle inserts historical information in a less-than-subtle manner (such as her description of the villagers' clothing) without grounding us in the reality of the time period. (What time period? In what country?) This aspect of the tale reminded me of Sherryl Jordan's _The Raging Quiet_, an equally implausible plot in an equally vague historical setting. Even the werewolf mythology is incomplete, not in how one becomes a werewolf, but in how one heals from being a werewolf. I wouldn't recommend this to a discerning fantasy reader."
4,Interesting,This story had an interesting twist on werewolf-ism but on the whole it was a good book. Definitely for a teen crowd but entertaining enough for an elder audience. My only problem with the book was the abrupt ending but at the same time it worked for the story so i can't judge too harshly on my preferences ;) I would definitely read it again and recommend it to others :)
1,Watch out! Make sure the ipod mini is in stock first.,"I ordered the Ipod Mini (pink) and this Arm Band at the same time. A day later, I get an email from Circuit City (the online affiliate of Amazon for the Mini) saying they have no Ipod Mini's instock and my order is cancelled. But, Amazon does not cancel my order for the Arm Band nor can I cancel it. So, I getting an Ipod Arm Band and no Ipod. Real Lame. I would wait until you have confirmation of shipping on the IPod Mini, before getting this Arm Band (they don't arrive together anyway) or you could be stuck getting an Arm Band (for $30) and no IPod."
1,HUGE waste of money!,"What possessed me to spend $30 on a rubbery piece of velcro?! I have no idea! I bought this thing because I was so paranoid about taking my new iPod mini to the gym, and I thought I should play it safe and get the arm band. HUGE waste of money! I should have just bought one of those wrist bands you can get at Target for $1.50 and clipped my iPod to it using the belt clip that it came with. That would have been just as effective as the ""official"" iPod mini armband, and I would be $28.50 richer than I am right now."
2,The clip is better,"I bought the armband when I got my mini ipod. However, the belt clip that comes with the iPod is perfect to clip to my shorts while jogging. You don't need this large, clunky armband!"
1,I hate it!,"Either I am idiot or this product is very poorly designed! It takes forever to get it just right, so that it won't slip off and still it feels uncomfortable and not quite right. Now they have them in sorts of colors, don't buy it, you'll just get annoyed everytime you want to use it, like me."
1,There is a better and much cheaper alternative,There is no need to buy this armband. Just get yourself a length of two-sided velcro (There is a kind that sticks to itself.) Wrap it around your arm and attach your iPod to it using the belt clip that came with it. This technique is especially good for those of us with large muscular arms where standard arm bands (like this one) won't fit.
3,Unusual science fiction,"This is an expanded edition of a short-story collection by the late Roger Zelazny (1937-95), a science fiction writer noted for his imaginative, often philosophical ideas. The best-known story here are A Rose for Ecclesiastes, which begins as a meditation on religion and ends with the protagonist saving a race that was thought doomed to extinction by sterility. There are several other good stories. This Mortal Mountain uses the metaphor of scaling mountains on alien worlds to explore ideas about death and the resilience of life in the face of ordeals. This Moment of the Storm is an allegory on chaos and inner turbulence, set in a frontier world in the distant future. Perhaps the most unusual is Keys to December, in which a genetically-engineered species sets out to create a new world for themselves, only to discover that they will be committing genocide against a new race that is still evolving. While not always consistent, Zelazny's stories were definitely original."
5,Great Collection of Short Stories,"Having finished Asimov's Foundation series recently, I was looking for a short story collection.Check out other reviews for more in-depth comments, but you will not be disappointed."
1,Disappointed,"Sportsman's Choice Deluxe Universal Cleaning KitBottom fell off box when removed from packaging, contents jumbled, patches not as pictured. Steel rods (I prefer aluminum as they are less likely to damage bore)."
2,lower your expectations,"I loved the Berlin Noir trilogy. I found Hitler's Peace very unsatisfying. Kerr fans who liked Philosophical Investigation and Esau may like this, but I doubt it. Hitler's Peace is larded with interesting philosophical questions like why Roosevelt insisted on ""unconditional surrender"" acted out against a backdrop of spy/counterspy, but in the end the book is neither/nor, not noir. Furthermore, the mayhem Kerr turns on his best characters is simply frigid. Read it, but lower your expectations."
3,Imagination tops plausibility.,"Yes, the backbone of the plot is totally implausible and lines like ""Good to meet you, I'm Evelyn Waugh"" spoken by characters never to reappear serve mostly to keep the reader awake but it's not that all that bad and a far better summer thriller than almost anything else new. The account of Roosevelt's voyage across the Atlantic on the new battleship Iowa is quite entertaining, particularly the quite authentic story of one of the escorts firing a torpedo at the Iowa. Outdoes Hamlet in casualties among the characters. Best part was reminding me that Kerr's first three Berlin stories now available in an inexpensive paperback, which I immediately ordered."
1,Please shoot the hero,"Like other reviewers here, I loved Berlin Noir, but this is like a rough draft. The characters never jell, historical references are shoved in willy-nilly to create ""authenticity,"" and the hero is an obnoxious, self-serving weakling. No one would have published this if an unknown writer had presented it, but the publisher (rightly) assumed that Berlin Noir fans could be burned once."
2,insult to history,"This is not a good book. The characters are wooden, the plot contrived, and the writing is simplistic and dull. Moreover, the idea that the great events of history could somehow be changed by improbable schemes supposedly hatched by Hitler and Stalin (with cameos form pet demons Himmler and Beria) is really insulting. The hero is a cartoon whose arrogance and self-pity really grate after a while. Yet somehow astute politicians such as FDR and Churchill defer to his judgement?Kerr does a good job of providing period versimilitude - not least in that his characters seem to smoke before and after every word, thought, and sex act. He pays attention to brands and models of stuff and that's why I gave it a 2."
1,Bad writing,"A lot of research went into this book, probably, but the writing is so clunky, and the characters so hard to believe, that it's wasted. The first paragraph is a curdled mess of furniture names and weak verbs, and it doesn't improve when the dialogue begins. Everyone seems to be a straw man, a plot device, and they all -- men, women, Nazis, FDR -- talk in the same stiff and formal language. Too bad."
2,Disappointing,"Fans of the excellent Berlin Noir trilogy and other of Kerr's earlier books will be disappointed by this. In the overflowing field of what-if books on the Second World War, ""Hitler's Peace"" offers one of the more improbable plots and will soon be forgotten."
3,The writing doesn't live up to the plot,"Kerr puts into play some great alt-history theories in this novel built around a series of curious events from the middle of WWII. I found myself eager to finish the book because I wanted to know how the story ended.But while curious to see how the story came out, I have to say that the reading itself was a bit of a chore at times. The characters were generally well developed and interesting, but their actions too often seemed totally out of character, overly contrived, or simply not believable. Dialog seemed forced and flat. As a reader I kept waiting for the author to hit his stride, but he never did. He just wobbled and faltered until finally stumbling across the finish line. Fans of spy novels and WWII-based fiction will enjoy, despite writing which is more mechanical than artistic."
2,A failure at re-written history,"I jumped at the chance to buy this book, and quickly read it. It neither does justice to the history of the period nor when it re-writes history. Hitler never won an election; he lost all of the elections he entered. He came to power only because he had the largest majority in the Bundestag. The Joints Chiefs came into being in August 1949. Constantly referring to Hap Arnold, George C. Marshall and the other generals and admirals as 'Joint Chiefs' detracts from the story line. What were they thinking? This does not add credence to the story line, it simply detracts from it. I had another problem with the sloppy editing. There were too many errors of grammar that never should have been made. I found the book to be easy reading, though, and quickly read. I enjoyed it even with these minor faults. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys this kind of period novel, but realize that it is not 100% authentic in accuracy or re-writing history."
2,Amateurish and Contrived,"This must be one of Kerr's earliest works, as it certainly doesn't measure up to his more recent efforts.The main character, Meyer, is, like most of Kerr's heroes, a fellow traveler who still seems to tilt to the left even after learning of two of Stalin's most diabolical massacres: the Katyn Forest Massacre and the murderous conditions inflicted upon German POW's.The plot is certainly far-fetched, as is the ending, although some of the characters are interesting.Don't waste your money."
3,A Little Too Cute,"Philip Kerr returns to war-torn Germany in HITLER'S PEACE, but sadly he doesn't bring Bernie Gunther with him. Without Gunther, Kerr turns to Willard Mayer, a very unsympathetic American diplomat, and his German counterpart, Walter Schellenberg, to carry the story.Neither suffice. Adding to the difficulties is that Kerr becomes a little too cute with his fictionalizing of the thoughts of real-life WWII characters FDR, Will Bill Donavan, Himmler, and Hitler himself. The plot revolves around an assassination attempt on FDR, Stalin, and Churchill in late 1943. Readable, but hardly BERLIN NOIR."
4,"w-w-w-well howdy, mam","Interesting variation on the small-town-boy-comes-to-the-city theme, with Jimmy Stewert as the noble-hearted hick falling in love with a girl from New York who's been round the block a few times, but to whose dalliances he remains impervious. My favourite scene is where Jimmy is told how the cattle are rounded up in Times Square. Let down only by a slightly sentimental ending."
5,Spellbound,"This was the first Christopher Pike book I ever read, and it spawned an addiction (or obsession depending on how you look at it!) It filled me with both fear and surprise. I found it intruiging, and powerful. It filled the void in my reading, as I had been looking for a long time for something, and didn't know what, this was it. The creativity of the ""beast"" in this book was exceptional, and it was a different, and more powerful writing style that I had ever found before. Pike's style is wonderful and captavating, and I love each and every one of his works. The setting is perfect, and the story is magical, it left me with chills. I couldn't put the book down! I recommend this book to everyone, get to know one of the greatest writers of the 20th century!"
4,Not one of his best but still creative,"Ok so this guy has written better. But I am not saying that this book sucks. In fact, the contrary. I thought it was a really good book and I recommend it to all Chris Pike fans. The characters are cool (I loved Alex the best). Doesn't turn out quiet how you expect it, but it is a little predictable, not totally though. Have fun reading it."
2,Fram CH9690 will NOT fit a 2007 Audi A6 with 4.2L V8,"I ordered five of these, and then found out they will not fit my 2007 Audi A6 with 4.2 V8. Buyer beware."
4,WOW! THE TITLE SPEAKS FOR ITSELF,"MAN GOD IS TOO BUSY BLESSING TO BE STRESSING! GOD HAS ANNOINTED ALL OF THESE WORSHIP SONGS, ECSPECIALLY SHOUT TO THE LORD! THAT SONG IS SO TRUE. IT'S TIME WE STOP BEING QUIET IN OUR COMFORT ZONES , GET UP AND MAKE SOME NOISE TO THE ALL POWERFUL GOD!"
5,Soldier from the War Returning,If you read but one book about the British Expeditionary Force's experience in the Great War this is the one. These types of autobiography's have a reputation for bitterness. This you will not find. Having served as a staff officer in World War II the author looks back (from the late 1960s) at the events beginning just before the War until the end of 1918. Details of life in a line infantry battalion along with the greater strategy of the Western Front. A great read.
4,Really quiet and efficient,"This is a really nice, lightweight portable vacuum. It does a wonderful job on my hardwood floors. It picks up all the dust, pollen, and cat hair..plus kitchen crumbs, etc. The hard floor brush stays on pretty well, but does get snagged on furniture legs if vacuuming under beds, etc., so be prepared to ""retrieve"" it periodically. The vacuum did not come with a round dusting brush, which would have made the vacuum more versatile. I use the one from my old vacuum, which works fine. I tried to go to their website to see if I could order one, but the website is pretty much useless. Overall, it is a good machine. It is so lightweight and quiet, I can get it out and vacuum up a mess while my husband watches TV. He doesn't even have to adjust the volume up. Its great for stairs since its so light."
2,Mine overheats and shuts down too!,"Looks like I'm in good company here with others whose Bosch canister vacuum started overheating and shutting down. I loved this product for the first year or so, but now it's useless. And I echo the complaints of others here that customer service is virtually non-existent. This model seemed like such a bargain, but replacing a vacuum every couple of years is hardly an attractive option...."
4,Really Great for the Price!,"I just installed expensive santos mahogany floors in my home and realized my upright Bissell would scratch the wood. I started looking for specialzed hard wood vacs and couldn't believe there were vacs in the $1000 range! This is the only specialized hard floor vac I could find in a reasonable price range (Sears actually sells it for almost $400 beware). After reading some of the neg reviews I was prepared for ""tipping over"", ""blowing hot air"", etc. I took a chance and so far I'm really happy with the results. It is a light unit so you have to be on the gentler side when pulling it around otherwise, I could see how it would tip over, and it only blows in your face if your bending at an awkward angle. So far so good!"
4,Hilarious,"What mom or dad won't see themselves in this book.Either living in a house with more ""stuff"" than we need, ordancing, sailing, or just sitting on the porch for entertainment,it's a fun view of family life.Everyone in the house can appreciate this book."
1,Authentic????,"This does not come w/the cloth dust bag it's supposed to. It comes w/a plastic bag. Does nothave the ""Prada"" logo on the inside lining either, (wich im told all authentic ""Prada"" has). AND the cheap looking logo on the front can easily be pulled off.I gave the hobo to my 10 yr old...."
1,Not Authentic - Don't Be Fooled,I ordered this bag only to receive it and find out it is a cheap knock-off. And it is not even a convincing knock-off! It looks cheap. I thought ordering it through amazon would be safe. Not so.
5,A Wonderful Collection,"This collection does nothing but improve these clasic Final Fantasy X songs. It takes such songs as 'Tidus's Theme' and 'Attack' and gives them a new feel and sound. Both become more gentle due to the the wonderful piano. 'Besaid Island' sounds very different at first and is probably the most transformed. Songs such as 'To Zanarkand' and 'The Path of Atonement' song a lot like there origins (because they were originally piano tracks), however there is enough of a difference, to make them feel like an all new track."
4,"A good, inexpensive Greek New Testament","Not much in the way of cross-references or indices--if you are not a student of Greek, you will need to procure a Greek-help book of some sort. For those familiar with the Greek text, this is a good basic New Testament. Greek typeface is easy to read as well."
3,OK...if heavily discounted on price,"I initially purchased 12 of these light fixtures when they were on sale for under $4 each. I had to purchase one more due to missing parts in one of the boxes. I'm not going to pay more to exchange a product than it cost. Amazon, I'm sure, knows this. These fixtures are cheap in price AND in quality; but they do work well, ie the bulb goes on when the switch is turned on. Just don't buy them for ease of installation or for aesthetics...and buy one or two extra for parts."
3,"Wanted less bla bla, more pictures of, well, ART","I respect the author based on her previous works on Teotihuacan. However in this large work of 335 pages I found myself in the midst of too much text and not enough photographs or other depictions of art. Yes there are around 320 plates/illustrations. But the amount of text was a bit much for me. This is because often, even with an art historian doing the schpeel, you end up receiving accepted ideas about a piece which may or may not have anything to do with what the work was originally about. I ended up feeling I was reading through others ideas about the Aztecs and that there was no voice of the Aztec themselves. This is a common danger in archeological works. So while I can recommend this book as a check out from a library I find it not taking a significant place in a personal collection on MesoAmerican art."
5,Pasztory's Aztec Art Review,"This is one of the best books I have ever purchased regarding the Aztecs. It gives great background to Mesoamerican civilizations as well as a detailed history regarding the Aztec world. The book contains excellent pictures and descriptions of every piece of Aztec art you could possibly think of. I have been to the Museum of Anthropology in Mexico City and most if not all works at the museum are featured in this book. I would highly recommend this work to anyone interested in Aztec civilization, Aztec art, or art in general."
5,Must buy,If you like the blues you need this album. I first heard this band in at the Northside Tavern about 5 years ago and they quickly became one of my favorite bands.
4,Again and again and again!,"The measure of a good book, whether it be poetry or or a ""how to"" , is not only the reader's enjoyment or entertainment, but how long the work stays with them. I first heard the works of Alexander's Kupenda as they tumbled out of his mouth at a reading and book signing. I purchased a copy thinking I would support a fellow poet and that a friend might gleen some comfort from ""The Remembering."" What surprised me was that as I reread the poems, they gained more meaning for me and soon, I was quoting Alexander's work which is so relevant to the highs and lows of everyday life. I never did lend my copy to a friend, instead I bought her one as a gift and I've given this moving collection of inspirational and touching poems as a gift again and again and again! Kudos to Alexander!"
5,A gem,Add mine to the list of 5 star reviews. This book is so charming I wish I could squeeze it.And the best part--I never tire of reading it over and over to my kids.
4,Wonderful drum set but need set replaced!,"Very nice drum set, love it but the seat has a tear on it and needs to be replaced! Would recommend this set"
3,A Bit Shallow,"Very nice pictures and some good description on Sumi-e dreamjourney painting. However, as an artist looking for more detailed explanations on techniques, I was quite disappointed. If I was just interested in general ideas on this type of painting the book would be great, but as an artist I was disappointed in the way the material was presented. For example, loading the brush was glossed over."
3,"Pretty good book, but dated","This was my first ""How To"" book on screenwriting. I read this book over 10 years ago. It would be nice if Ms. Stuart updated it.The book does have some interesting info on what script readers are looking for and how to make it through the ""Hollywood maze"". Very cool. But what has changed in Hollywood in the last 10-12 years? You'll find more recently published books that attempt to answer that question.Also, a lot of this book is a tutorial on screenwriting. It's pretty basic, but the information is still good.There are a lot of other books out there that focus on either the ""Hollywood maze"" or on the craft of screenwriting; and the content in these other books is more extensive and up-to-date. Don't get me wrong, this isn't a bad book. But I think it's time we've left the 1980's Joe Ezterhaus/Shane Black world of screenwriting behind us, and instead focused on something better than ""high concept""."
4,A comprehensive look at the business of screenplays,"A comprehensive look at the business, structure, and art of writing screenplays. An excellent start for someone new to the business to get an overall sense of what's required to create and sell a successful screenplay."
4,"no wasted words, to the point and extremely helpful","Linda's book was easy to read and comprehend. I enjoyed the humor and the honesty. Although, I did not agree on some of the titles Linda used as examples, I did see the reasoning behind those decisions. I rented most of the films and looked for all the qualities that were pointed out. I read the book cover to cover, and then went back to certain areas that most interested me. I studyied it like a text. Then, I went back and looked at it again. My dad and I had done some films together, but he did all the ""real stuff"",so now on my own, I need the do's and don'ts. It was written in a cute way that was entertaining, and easy to utilize. Good job, Linda. And, thanks for helping the ""unknowns""."
3,"Best work about the Battle of Mill Springs, KY, 19 Jan 1862.","Long out of print, this reprint (new intro) represents older scholarship. The book is nonetheless the only book that deals at length with the Battle of Mill Springs, KY (a.k.a. Fishing Creek, a.k.a. Logan's Crossroads). It's also the main work on Brig. Gen. Felix K. Zollicoffer, CSA. For anyone with any interest in the battle, in Gen. Zollicoffer, or in the history of the this region of KY, this book is an absolute must-have."
4,"Fascinating, and well-written","Offering no less than a summary of the history of human thought, from the beginning to today (or at least 1992). Sometimes van Doren stretches himself a bit too far on a point, but for the most part I think he is very solid in what he posits, and backs it all up very well. Do not let this be your only history of knowledge book, however (and, obviously, that advice rings true for any subject - never stick with just one book or author). But, for the person who is interested in this topic, but does not feel the need to do a master's degree on it, ""History of Knowledge"" is just what you need."
5,I love it,Everynight i am in a diferent period of time and I feel like I am living it.Excelent book. I am in the middle ages now.
1,Horrible!! - Gaping holes in history and understanding,"I stumbled upon this book and read a few lines, convinced it looked like an informative book. I was unpleasantly surprised during the next week as I tried to digest it. I have a few comments: His story of Columbus's ""discovery"" of America fails to even briefly mention how he betrayed, slaughtered and enslaved the native americans. Unbelievable. My other brief comment: as a scientist, I was first amused, then offended, by his discussion of the scientific method. This guy has absolutely no concept of how scientists think (he claims it's all math, no ideas/concepts); his sweeping generalizations and stereotypes completely ignore current research in the neurosciences regarding learning and memory and the mind/body problem, not to mention the rest of the entire field of biomedical sciences. Overall, I found this book to be irritatingly simplified. I strongly discourage wasting your time reading it - I took my copy back to the bookstore!!"
1,"poor writing with inaccurate ""facts""","Poor writing with inaccurate ""facts"" and that was the first few pages. When I would finish a paragraph I couldn't stop myself from thinking how it could have been written more clearly. I stopped reading after he said Jesus was born on December 25th and according to the Christian creed Jesus ascended into hell. There is more than one Christian creed, and Jesus was not born in the year 0 on December 25th. If he was going to get these very basic facts wrong I didn't want to waste my time."
3,Good - still reading,Initially bought for my dad but I am reading it first. There is a lot of good and interesting information about the growth of knowledge. Some of the explanations are excessively padded with words and meaningless phrases and biased towards christianity. Still enjoy it and I will continue reading anyway.
2,not a history of knowledge--more a synopsis of history,"Fine bedtime reading--highly soporific! This book has a huge Western Civilization/Chrisitianity bias, as though anyone reading it would only be interested in other cultures to the extent that they influenced the dominant culture. The shallowness of his remarks in areas that I know a great deal about lead me to distrust his remarks in areas that I am less familiar with. After a while, I found that what I really wanted to do was re-read Boorstin's Discoverers, which is far more interesting and satisfying."
1,"Useless trash, boring and trivial","I can't believe I was seduced. The text rambles to no point. There are no footnotes for his sometimes outrageous assertions, no source to challenge. The chapter ""What the Romans Knew"" discussed law, citizenship and roads. Each of these was given a few paragraphs at most. What about trade, navigation and legions?I won't go on...I literally ripped the book in two."
1,Sophomoric,Outline history of Western civilization and thinking.Naive and biased both in its religious and cultural points of view. Appropriate for ninth or tenth grade high school students.
1,Author's biases mar this otherwise well-written book,"Van Doren's writing style is accessible and refreshing, but it can't overcome the fact that he believes Christianity is the one true religion, and that Western history is what's really important. I would expect to see this in a religious bookstore, and I was surprised to see no mention of the author's Christian bias on the book's jacket. Had I known about it I would not have purchased the book. Not recommended."
1,This guy is nuts,"He makes WAY too many mistakes and states everything like it's fact!! He says that Shakespeare's plays weren't even written by Shakespeare himself, but by someone else and Shakespeare took the glory. HELLO! That's the story that Shakespeare wrote himself! He also uses views of cults when ""explaining"" Christianity. He states that Jesus went to hell for three days, after He was crucified. THE BIBLE NEVER SAID THAT!!! This is a cultic belief and is not Christian. He provides no footnotes and expects us to take is work for fact and not even question him. He makes many more careless mistakes, and I think that his book is sick and twisted. Don't waste your time."
5,I Knew This One Would Be Good...,"Heading into this book I had heard a lot of good things about it...but none of it firsthand...so even though I was fairly sure I would like this book I still had some doubt. Very early on all doubt was squelched. This book is fantastic. A space opera in the truest sense of the word...spanning across light-years of space. I've read quite a bit of SciFi and there are several ideas in this book that are, if not totally unique, used in ways that I've never seen before. This book is definitely worth the time spent on it...you'll come away eager for more of Alastair Reynolds's work."
3,Could use an editor,"This book was chock full of interesting concepts and characters. I enjoyed the universe that Reynolds created. However, this book needed an editor with a heavier hand. The writing was difficult to slog through and at many times detracted from what was otherwise a great concept. This is the first of his books I have read and his first novel as well, hopefully his skills as a writer will improve with experience."
2,"Lots of talent for science, not enough for fiction.","Reynolds has packed a lot of ""hard science"" stuff into the novel, and he has a lot of imagination along those lines. But his writing skills need to be more mature. The characters aren't engaging, and do not seem to have distinct personalities or internal motivations.The story also develops too slowly, and the reader is kind of strung along until the end as if it were a mystery novel, however there isn't any real sense of suspense, mystery or wonder that might motivate you to keep reading.Hard to believe this is the same novel that is hyped on the cover. While my review is rather negative, this book isn't awful, but it suffers in comparison to the hype."
2,Too complicated for some(me),"This was a very interesting book, but it took me seemingly forever to get it read. It's really laborious. The author jumps around much too much and trys to get too way out for me. I could not keep all the ends together. And it didn't seem to have an ending. The following book, Chasm City, I thought was to be a sequel, which I don't care much for, but that turned out to be not the case. In any event, I think the austhor has a lot of promise and future books should be better."
2,EMPTY SPACE!,"I love hard sci-fi, but Mr Reynold's Revelation Space is a dull and insipid second-rate tale that belongs somewhere in the Star Trek league.It might all be scientifically squared off, but the storyline is repetitious and confusing, the characters lack any saving graces, and the ending is incredibly unimaginative and sell-out.To me, it felt like Mr Reynolds was trying to distill the best of Iaine M.Banks, Dan Simmons and Peter F Hamilton all into one pastiche of the genre...and failed.Mr Reynolds, either stick to the hard science you understand, or take a writing course in developing human characters we can sympathize with and actually want to follow across the universe.Sorry Alastair, but Revelation Space reads like Empty Space."
2,Badly Edited,"The publishers of this book, Orion Publishing Group, should be ashamed of themselves. This is my first book by alastair reynolds. Though I think he could one day be a very competent writer, I feel like he isn't really ""there"" yet. However, if Orion wanted to publish a book by him, they could have at least put an interested Editor on board in order to clean up the numerous spelling mistakes, typographical errors, character flaws, plot holes, and narrative definicies rampant throughout the novel.I skimmed the last hundred or so pages because the writing just got increasingly worse. The dialogue was terrible. There was constant repetition of previous passages. I feel like this book was written in pieces, and instead of tying it all together in a seamless fashion, the author clumped it together, and badly at that.However, I did finish the book, so there must have been some redeeming qualities."
4,Liked it very much,"A trippy little book about future space exploration, nanotechnology, genetic engineering, near light-speed travel and dead alien cultures, Revelation Space has apparently disparate plots that take a while to weave together. Lucky thing that everyone in the story is long-lived enough to bring all the plots together in a satisfying tapestry of delight. I liked it very much, for the detailed descriptions of the technologies, the humanness of the protagonists (even the evil ones) and the strangeness of the dead(?) aliens and the malevolence of the Universe (see also Fermi Paradox). I liked it so well and enjoyed the weaving that I'm not going to tell you anything about the book other than you should get it, read it (or listen; that's what I did...by the way, the narrator varies his speech volume enough to make car noise an issue--fair warning) and thank me for not giving anything away.You're welcome."
5,Brilliant Sci Fi storytelling,If you are looking for an exceptionally intelligent story and an amazing story writing style; this is the book for you. I read a novel a week at the least and this was one of the best I have come across in a long while. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!
4,Good First Sci-fi Novel,"Reynold's Revelation Space was an interesting story on the way humanity began to evole into a different species through the use of science, though his claim that culture not nature as a vehicle for evolution was unconvincing.What I did enjoy was the scope of the plot of his novel that remind me of Isaac Asimnov's ""The Foundation Trilogy"" or Robert Blumetti's ""Ironstorm."" The galactic scope of the story was well done and believible soaring across time and space. If you like to read complex stories then I recormend Revelation Space."
3,"Too big, too sprawling, too slow","The problem with this book is not the writing, not the very interesting world, nor the characters being depicted. It's just that it takes Mr. Reynolds so many many pages to line up his storytelling ducks in this particular series.I made through about half of Absolution Gap (the 3rd in the series) before giving up in frustration. Since then, I have learned that it was the last volume, but this was in no way obvious on page 200 or so - it just looked like it was going to drone on forever.I think that Reynolds is one of the better new SF talents. But starting this set is only worthwhile if you really really don't mind long books. If you value brevity, by all means read something else of his."
2,Didn't like it.,"I ordinarily finish what I start reading, and I did with this one...but barely. This book has great ideas but is not written very well. The plot does not hold your attention and the characters don't stand out as interesting people. It turns out to be neat science but dull..dull...dull writing. I tried the sequel also.. same..."
3,"Starts slowly, but builds your anticipation...","In Revelation Space, you'll be exposed to futuristic cyborg ""ultra-humans,"" ageless mysteries, other intelligent races, self-repairing spaceships, new weapons systems, planetary politics... really, there is so much that is different here that it seems overwhelming to the reader. You really have to keep track of a lot.And although the plot is slow to unfold, and jumps around in time and space, author Alastair Reynolds does get it done. The mystery is huge, and will affect all life in the galaxy. A clone of a famous scientist (who doesn't know he is a clone) is pursued to either be killed or to save the captain of a plague-infested ship. Sounds lame, I know. But the story is much, much more complicated than that.There are additional books that spring from Revelation Space. I'm not sure that I'm going to look for them, although I am interested in reading some of Reynolds' other sci-fi books. I guess the jury is still out."
1,Disappointed,"I was excited after reading the positive reviews for this book, and after reading the first few pages. But by page 150 I realized that I no longer cared what happened next. The characters are incredibly dull and one-dimensional. I also was frustrated by the fact that there seemed to be no logic in what the author chose to describe at length, versus what was hardly described at all. Relatively unimportant objects where described in detail, while more important objects were hardly described or explained at all. Skip this one."
3,Review of Kindle edition,"I'm reading this now....this is a very slow read for me for some reason. I think it is the writing style. At half way through it is getting interesting now.The Kindle edition has many, many, many errors - spelling, punctuation, formatting.If a company wants to set a top dollar paper book price for an electronic edition, they can at least do a professional job at editing the edition. The poor editing looks low brow and unprofessional."
3,"Excellent ""Scientific Creativity""; Mediocre Plot","I found this book worth the read for the creative technology concepts; the author even ventured into explanations of how the future technology works (my favorite ""definition"" of Science Fiction). Sadly, the storyline lacked plot development. It was cohesive and mysterious. But the plot wasn't very interesting; it just didn't pull me in. Finally, a co-author with military-SF background could have really helped with the various ""confrontations""."
3,Irritation Space,"You have to hand it to Reynolds: he must be a good stringer-along, because I finished this book despite being irritated to the nth degree. The promises of great discoveries and hidden treasures were enough to make me put up with the obsessive repetition of his fetish word ""flense"" and non-word ""disorientate,"" as well as a simple dearth of proofreading or editing. The characters are so one-dimensional you can't even speculate what they'll do next; I was glad when one character died just so I wouldn't have to keep track of him anymore. Reading this book was sheer drudgery and not even the 2001-derived ending could make it worth my time to read any more of them."
2,Very disappointing,"I've read much more than my share of SF over the years, from short-shorts to multi-book sets, and this book was definitely one of the biggest disappointments.Reynolds is a gifted writer, no argument there. But he's also far too in love with the cheap technique of conspicuously keeping secrets from the reader; there are too many places where one character tells another A Big Secret, and the author has to skip or gloss over the conversation to keep it from the reader. It's cheesy and more than a little annoying.I also thought there were too many places where his prose needed much more attention from an editor, particularly in those areas where Reynolds lapsed into techno-purple prose.I was really looking forward to this book and the sequels, but I'll skip the rest."
2,Disappointing,"Perhaps the cover text about ""Best Sci-Fi of the Year"" raised my expectations too high, but I was disappointed in this book. Although it has some interesting devices and some reasonably plausible science, the characters and their interaction with each other and their world simply wasn't compelling. There's no real hero; maybe an anti-hero. In addition, the ""epic"" plot line taking place over centuries merely serves to confuse and to rip you from one locale you're just starting to be interested in to the next, 50 -100 years later. As a measuring stick, I'd give Peter Hamilton's Night's Dawn (The Reality Dysfunction) series five stars."
1,Deeply Disappointed...,"Had a lot of hope when I began to read this tome.. and tome it is... it just meanders on and on and nothing moves ahead... sluggish. I've only managed to get through the first 100 pages and when I put it down I was relieved... nothing has drawn me back to it since. Just didn't engage me for some reason...probaly because it's really a rather dull beginning... And (as other reviewers have stated) I'm sorry too because I really did want to like this book. It's just a big lump of something impenetrable... and so uncomfortable to hold it in your hands, it weighs a ton!!"
2,Fizzled towards the end,"The good part of the book was that it is unpredictable, mysterious, and a bit suspenseful at times. However, this cannot overcome the lack of character development. The author could have killed off any character in the book at any time, and I couldn't have cared less. I was a bit bored by the end, and only stuck with it to see where the author was going.A large part of the book deals with people converted in AI on machines. However, the author made little attempt to make these AI personalities seem like ""Real Life"". I would recommend Tad William's Otherworld for a better treatment of the subject."
4,"Uneven, Bizarre,...","Despite its *numerous* problems, this book kept me reading until the last page to see what would happen. (Then I threw it across the room into the donation box, cursing profusely.)Revelation Space is a conundrum. The characters are so two-dimensional and shallow it is almost impossible to tell them apart, the pacing may be the worst I have ever read, the editor should be fired (and reminded how to use spell check), the author needs writing lessons; and yet, it was a good yarn -- mostly. (The last hundred or so pages made me stop and look at the cover to make sure I hadn't picked up another book by mistake.)This could have been a truly excellent book."
5,"Finally, another great sci-fi author to read","While this book had a few problems, I thought that it was an excellent read, particularly in its outstanding world-building. The characters are interesting as well, in particular the cyborg interstellar space crew.For whatever reason, the British seem to be building the most interesting future worlds for a reader to explore. I refer to the likes of Banks, Hamilton and MacLeod. If you enjoy those authors, then this book is a must read. I eagerly await the US publication of his next books."
1,For Bulwer-Lytton fans only,"This is appallingly written. Some gems:""Fire burned in their minds too, but this was the unquenchable fire of being.""""'Assassination tools!' Girardieu shouted.""""Volyova digested this knowledge for a few moments before regurgitating it as a tiny, troublesome cud of certainty.""Quite hilarious, really; perhaps the whole thing is tongue-in-cheek? Such depths could only be reached intentionally."
1,"Puerile, Annoying, Rambling","Just mind numbingly bad. Annoying, obnoxious, sociopathic characters. Atrocious writing style. Totally dystopic. Irritating and depressing to read.All the one star reviews are completely accurate.How did this junk get published?"
4,Flawed but fascinating,"Despite some muddled writing and turgid plotting, I found the future universe posited by Reynolds to be entertaining enough to plough through the occasional low points. Not so much a ""fun"" read as one which draws you in. Reminded me strongly of Stephen R. Donaldson's ""The Gap into..."" series, with its emphasis on moral choices and somewhat bleak view of the world."
2,Didn't get it,"I love hard sci-fi novels, but seriously, I have no idea what this book was about or how I managed to finish it."
5,Excellent Read,I thoroughly enjoyed this epic series. The universe created is richly detailed and original. Revelation Space is expertly woven together with interesting characters and a believable vision of the future. Highly recommended!
3,Very few original ideas here,"R. Lundquist and Christopher Lewis get it largely correct with their reviews. It is an interesting read for those who love sci-fi, as I do, but you should not expect to have your world shaken or re-shaped by this book. Many, if not most of the ideas used here were originated in other stories by other authors. Now, that is not necessarily such a horrible thing. Artists often copy the best ideas, styles and techniques of other gifted artists. The hope is that they will build and expand upon those great ideas that came before. Unfortunatley, that is not really the case here. Not a bad read, and I did finish it, so I will recommend it to others, but you will note I only gave it three stars."
5,A Wonderfully Fresh Translation,"New City Press has provided a valuable service by translating afresh the works of St. Augustine. This is the first of eleven volumes, containing the first 19 of 400 translated sermons.Augustine's Sermons are not yet available in e-book format from either New City Press or The Fathers of the Church series produced by Catholic University of America Press, so for the time being you will have to avail yourselves of these invaluable works as books.Overall highly recommended if you have the space to house these works."
4,"Great beginner tape, will soon lead to harder moves.","Great for a beginning exerciser-low impact, but a good work-out. After a few viewings, the moves are easy to follow. After a few weeks you're ready to progress to something a little bit harder. Very motivational and warm up, exercise, cool down all in only 30 minutes. I can do it in the morning before work and still not be late!!!"
1,Xtra-Xtra Lite!,"I am a beginner/almost intermediate who has loved Denise's workouts for years (although I didn't excercise much). I was also about 100lbs overweight when I purchased this tape, and bought it in the hopes of getting a routine that was not too complex but would get my heart rate up.Unfortunately, this workout is beyond Xtra lite. I only did the routine once because it really was boring and ineffective. I didn't work up any sweat or increase my heart rate. Also, the music was so boring! I ended up putting on my own music and improvising dance moves while the tape was on! I do still love Denise and would recommend some of her other tapes that use interval training. This is good for true novices and those who have very limited physical abilities."
2,I didn't like this,"I didn't like this tape so much. I felt like Denise was more concerned with showing off her body and swinging her hips around, than with explaining the movements and concentrating on form. Also, I felt like the steps were a little too dancy, and hard to follow if you're not co-ordinated"
3,"Requires coordination, not for the true beginner","This video is not exactly for the true beginner to aerobics, having NEVER done aerobics before and having not exercised in years, I found this video difficult to do. Some of the steps are confusing and require a lot of coordination, it is difficult to hear the instructions, and it may be too intense of a workout for someone who has not exercised in some time. Don't get me wrong, if you are coordinated, regularly active and familiar with aerobics, this may be the perfect work out for you!"
2,Too complicated,"Overall the format of the tape is fine: warm up, exercise, cool down. But I expected more from a beginner's tape. Like actaully showing you how to do the steps. Most of them were easy enough that it didn't really matter, but a significant section of the middle of the tape was spent adding new twists to a turn step which didn't get enough attention. I rewound that section 5 times, and still couldn't figure out how she did the turns."
5,"Quick, easy, fun and shows results","I found this video to be great! Seems easy but you end up sweating by the time the video is over. Denise keeps you motivated while giving you little tips throughout the video. I've seen results by using this video along with a couple of other videos by Denise Austin (Pilates, Super Stomachs, Hit the Spot)."
4,Great Aerobic Foundation,"I have recently gotten back in to working out and have found this video to be a great foundation video for building up your fitness level. I have moved on to more challenging ""Denise"" videos, but this one is great for building up a sweat when time is short and an entire 45 minute video is a hassle..."
4,Easy on the back,"I used to be very physically active but now suffer from a bad back condition. I can do this video however, because it is completely non impact. I enjoy Denise Austin's enthusiasm. The only knock is I wish it were longer and you progress out of it too quickly."
2,Out to make a quick buck,"Although this video was not terribly taxing and thus qualifies for ""Xtra Lite"" in my book, I wasn't very impressed with the rest of it. I feel like she went to the beach, threw on a cute outfit, and winged it from there. The sound is poor, the music is ..., and she [messes] up so many times I find it difficult to follow, even after watching it repeatedly ... I do not recommend this tape."
3,Good workout if you are just starting to get in shape,"This was my first exercise video. I did gym-dance several years ago and from there never stopped dancing, be it in the disco, creating choraographies, and so on, so I like things with a bit more pace, but this is just right to start out if you are out of shape (after having my daughter I ended up about 40 lbs too heavy) and want to get moving. It has prety simple moves, but not too simple that you won't be challenged. And if you do it regularly for a while, it will prepare you for some real stuff, like some serious cardio.I gave it 3 stars only because I have now not used it for a while, as it's not challenging anymore, plus Denise's constant chatter becomes a little annoying after a while..."
5,A must for ANY parent. I bought 20 copies.,"It is ""road map"" to parenting and a encouraging tool for fatherhood. I purchased 20 copies for friends. It's a must regardless of the child's age."
5,Best advice yet,"I got this book when my oldest daughter was going through the terrible two phase. The advice it gives is priceless. It talks about your childs physical and psychological development it really helps you to understand your child better. Not only does it explain the thought process of each age, it gives advice on every topic. I found the advice to be unbiased and realistic useable advice. I've kept this book and read it over and over for each of my children. It has been a godsend."
4,Basic but works,"Actually, I purchased two of these, one in black and one in white in the 32-inch length, not by design but because I mistakenly thought that they didn't have the black one in XL. In any case, if you are around size 18, you can make do with a size large if you have to (because of the size slits), but the XL will be more comfortable. This is a no frills half slip but well worth the $12 price, including super saver shipping. Because it's so basic, you could hem it if you needed to. Just try to find this item in either Penney's or Macy's. You can't. I needed this to go under a long, gauzy skirt, and it does the job; no more see-through. The reason it loses a star with me is that it isn't antistatic."
1,Too long!,This slip is much longer than it looks in the picture. It's more like mid-calf. Disappointing and perhaps a little deceptive?
1,Sent the wrong item,I ordered this half slip to go under a dress I had bought. I ended up being sent a full slip instead of a half slip. I was very upset by this because I needed it to wear under a long dress and ended up having to buy another.
5,The Last Chapter,"I enjoyed the book so much that I just had to reread it. The ancient Romans probably did not know their empire and culture were crumbling until it was too late. Americans seem just as blind. Many take the unrealistic view that ""All will work out in the end"". Berman has about the best final chapter I have ever seen with respect to similar books. Most books on the subject had their authors adding a final chapter with all sorts of pie-in-the-sky unworkable solutions. For example, things like we must elect better people to government; we must hold our politicians to their word and so on. Berman knowns better. He says that the best we can hope for is a slowing of the decline and he's right. A people that can't pull themselves away from things like ""The Big Game"", Paris Hilton and the rest are doomed to fail especially when there are other cultures that have their eyes on being number one."
2,Sardonic,"I tried to like this book; I really, did. But the author's style comes across to me as arrogant. Personally, I like my non-fiction as free from sardonic comments as possible, and this text is absolutely riddled with them. There is no doubt about the axes this author has to grind - he makes them clear - and unfortunately I think this hinders an otherwise interesting theory."
2,"Poorly written, disorganized, hysteric in some places",".Publishers Review called Berman's work 'scattershot"", which is a polite way of saying 'disorganized'.I'll skip critique about the content...over the last 35 years I've read 50-60 books about the decline of America. Still waiting for it to happen.Berman biggest crime is his terrible writing mechanics. It takes an enormous effort to follow the flow of his writing and discover what point he's trying to make. Also, Berman needs to go back to Rhetoric 101 and relearn the mechanics of constructing an argument so that your points are supported...rather than just sound like some street corner semi-lucid preacher.,"
2,Author loses credibility,"While the author certainly makes some interesting points regarding the flaws in American society and politics, his argument loses credibilty when he continually predicts that either Europe or China will overtake us. Europe and China are very flawed animals not to mention very different from each other. The fact that the author simply lumps the two countries/regions together as potential ""overtakers"" of America leads me to believe that the authour is more intent on predicting America's 3rd rate status without giving real thought to the merits of the eventual powers, Europe and China. This was a total ""agenda"" work!"
1,Disappointing,"The idea that America is in decline is intriguing. Our nation continues to attract the most immigrants from all corners of the globe, a sign, in fact, of vibrance and ascendancy. Why would people flock to a land of tyranny, poverty, and injustice? Perhaps because America is not these things.Indeed, Berman's litany of ills are found in greater magnitude, not surprisingly, in the very nations these people are fleeing. Berman knows, like most folks, that America isn't perfect. Unlike most folks though, he doesn't see that America is good. This is what makes his books so disappointing: it's clear he doesn't understand that distinction. I'm glad my grandparents escaped an authoritarian, communitarian, 'non-materialistic' (read: poor) country to come to America. Berman and his family can be happily shipped there in our stead."
3,fond memories?,"Social analysts usually become social analysts from despair. Their grasp of history, however, usually extends as far backwards as their childhood. If we are falling from grace, when was the golden era? But the author can't remember slavery, or genecide, or a series of chauvinistic wars, or limited sufferage, or community achieved by the exclusion of others. Human history will always be tragic & comedic, because that's human nature. He should look on the bright side: contemporary Republicans may stand for god, guns, & infinite greed, but a woman running against a black man for Democratic nomination is one of the most wonderful moments in our history."
5,The Hobo Philosopher,"I don't know how I missed this guy. He is great. I would say that he is in the I.F. Stone category. He has been around forever and has written volumes, but I only found out about him via a volume that I picked up at a yard sale. The book was called ""The Great Thoughts.Great Thoughts, Revised and Updated"" And it is exactly what the title implies. I have had it on my bed stand for years. Finally I decided to look up the name on the cover - Compiled By Geroge Seldes. So I then sent for this book. It is great and when I finish it I will probably order another by Mr. Seldes. He was obviously a ""cool"" old man.Richard Edward Noble - The Hobo Philosopher - author of:""Hobo-ing America: A Workingman's Tour of the U.S.A.."""
2,unsatisfied,"I didn't like it, it is more like a toy and not an instrument, plus the cover seams so like greasey or something. I do not recommend it"
5,Please re-release Zigity!,"I am a teacher and use this game as a learning reward or indoor recess activity. My family loves it as well. This is the third one I have purchased. The first one I gave to a student who loved it because that student had worked so hard to move from F- to A- in one school year. This student also gained in knowledge to catch up with grade level peers. The second one was ""lost"" in a move along with several other things. It took me a long time to replace it with game 3."
3,Not one of my top 10 favorites,"I played this game with my 11 year old. It's a slow, quiet game. It's not anything like the other Cranium games that are packed with fun, action and lots of laughs. The game has very simple rules, so it takes no time at all to learn how to play. Which makes it good for the younger kids. The object is to get rid of the cards in your hand by making ""sets"". If your tired from a long day at work but still want to spend some time with your child, then this game is good for that. It's not necessarily a bad game. Just a little on the boring side. I'll play it when ever my daughter wants to, it just won't be a game I would suggest if she asks me what I want to play. It sort of has the Uno game feel to it. You need to match cards and there are even action cards that tell you to either draw 2 cards, skip a turn or reverse the order of play. Agian, not a bad game, just a game that doesn't need a lot of energy to play."
3,"OKAY, BUT NOT GREAT","I had great expectations for this game, but was disappointed. First of all, the cards ARE slippery as another reviewer stated so be prepared for them to be slipping all over the place. Secondly, my 5 year old, who loves cadoo,had no interest in this game. And lastly, the game is really very simple with no challenge. It can be played in 5 minutes. However, for such an easy game there are a lot of rules. We had to play it many times before we didn't have to look back at the directions anymore for guidance. Cadoo is much better. The directions are very straight forward and it encourages creative brain development. For zigity you just have to be able to add simple numbers or form simple words. It's just not there for my family. But, your's may like it."
2,So-so... Not thrilled,"This pen is okay, but nothing to write home about (pun intended!!!) It definitely writes, but is not extremely comfortable to write with, and the ink does not flow extremely well. Wouldn't bother to replace it with the same pen..."
3,Not as good as imagined,"These are pretty good pens. That being said, I thought these were going to be phenomenal, earth shatteringly good, amazing pens. They were not.ProsThey write wellThey are functionalThey look good.ConsThey grip is hard. Maybe I grip too tightly when I write but they hurt my fingers to write with.The actual writing from this pen is not particularly smooth and somewhat uneven.The clip is made of a very thin piece of metal which could be sturdier for people who actually use the clipThe depressor for actuating the pen itself has no spring to hold it up when you click the pen in to write so it will wiggle around and such if you were to shake it.Obviously I am just nitpicking at this point, but I expected a perfect pen and it just wasn't particularly good."
5,Perfect,"These pens write smoothly and last well for a good price. They are clear plastic with ribs under your fingers for a good grip. I don't care for fat pens with padded grips, so this works great for me. I can also monitor the ink level easily."
5,The only pen I will ever use!,"I work in a fast moving retail sales business where the pen is an important tool. I have used the Pilot Better Ball Point Pen for about 20 years. I use them all day, every day and these Pilot pens have never failed to write! These pens are in and out of my pocket many times every day, they always write and I have never had one malfunction in any way. The metal pocket clips never fall off, they always retract properly, etc. When I hand one to a customer to sign a sales order or receipt they frequently comment on how well they write. They are just the right size and while not fancy, they don't look or feel cheap. In my opinion, this the best pen available. They are just about impossible to buy where I live today, near Tampa, Fl. I am glad Amazon carries them. This is one the best products I have ever used."
5,These are the best!,"Best ballpoint pens out there. Easy to hold. The ink doesn't glob up. No cap to keep track of, I've never seen one leak, and we've been using them for 15 years.I regularly buy them two or three boxes at a time."
2,"Okay, but not spectacular","I'm trying to understand her appeal. Yes, her high notes are INCREDIBLE but so are Mady Mesple's and Sumi Jo's and Lily Pon's and Joan Sutherland's and...well you get the picture. It IS nice to have a sample of Mozart'a lesser known arias and after listening to this cd 3 years after I bought it at the urging of my voice teacher I would probably rate this at 3 stars instead of two but I still don't like her middle range and there is no low range. Doesn't exsist. I just can't worship her like my own personally savior like my teacher thinks I should. I just don't see the perfection that others do. And she may be an incredibly gifted actress on the stage which I would not know as I have not seen her but her interepertation of every song leaves me cold. She sounds almost robotic in some places. And I simply hate her ""revenge aria"" from Mozart's Magic Flute. So many people have just done it so much better."
5,From the Producers Desk,"A fantastic piece of work from the two time NAMMY winner Cherokee National Youth Choir! Traditional Christian Christmas Songs in the Cherokee Language, and a great original piece for the title cut.It was a joy to record this historical piece of work, these kids are the best, we love 'em!Jeffrey & Margarett ParkerCimarron Sound Lab"
5,Fun and exciting music!,This CD contains the well known songs of Shakin Stevens thatI remembered from long ago. Clean and crisp sound. Entertainingfrom beginning to the end. No regrets buying this one!
4,my dog likes them,"My dog likes the treats. They may be a little hard for smaller dogs to chew. There are way more than enough treats to fill the tin, so it pretty much comes with it's own refill."
1,old and different product from the original,"I agree with some of the other reviewers. This is not the original product. The color and smell is different. While my dog likes them, she became very sick after eating a couple of them and was a mess to clean up. She had eaten the original product for the past year with no problems. I will be seeking a refund as this is not the product I was expecting. Beware this product has changed."
2,The Color I got was Brown,I ordered these because my dogs have had them before and liked them. The picture shows the mints as off white or light brown. The ones that I got were a darker brown and my dogs don't like them. They smell awful. I was very disappointed and so were my dogs.
1,Foul smelling,"These treats smell terrible, and in the name of science I gave one to the dogs ... and now they smell terrible too. Sort of like the anti-breath mint. Would never purchase, touch, or get near these things again."
1,100? I dont think so,"It says over 100 tasty little bones, my package had at least 20. I demand a investigation!"
2,Dogs find them unappealing!,Neither our Toy Poodle or the Australian Shepherd will eat these. They smell like a vitamin. They are also brown. The expiration date says 12/2013. I think they expired long ago. The whole room smells when you open the box. I requested a refund.
1,I cant even force these brown things on my dog,I am not sure why these show on here that they are white. They are dark brown?? I managed to get my dog to eat one once and after that he won't go anywhere near them and he is not picky when it comes to stuff like this. And one was left on our covered porch since he didn't eat it and the next day it looked like he had an accident...all mushy brown...YUK
3,Interesting novel about Baseball and its fans..,"Gil Renard is an unforgetable, but unlovable charater in Peter Abrahams's ""The Fan"". He is slowly simmering over the crap that other people give him, with stupid bosses selling crappy knives and blaming him for them not selling. His ex is also shrewish, and he tries to relate to his son, but fails. Soon, Gil finds himself getting closer to a star hitter for the Sox(a unnamed city, but we know he's talking about Boston), while Gil himself starts descending in murder and theft. The commentary about Sox Fans is mostly true, and the ending is definately out of science fiction."
3,My Review,"The Fan is a fast paced thriller that will appeal to both to fans of the genre (no pun intended) and to the sports geek who wants to expand into other reading areas. The storyline is fast-paced with quite a bit of suspense and more than enough baseball and behind the scenes of professional sports for the sports enthusiast. The novel does a nice job of switching back and forth between the protagonist (a knife salesman who is down on his luck), the sports star (who also is battling through a career slump) and the media. It's an entertaining book that moves along pretty quickly and is really good for an escape from the day to day.Of course, if you've seen the film with Robert DeNiro and Wesley Snipes, there aren't a whole lot of surprises in the book, but there are a few differences. The film actually did a really good job of capturing the feel of the book though and although there are some changes here and there, both the book and the film work at accomplishing their ultimate goals."
4,For Children Who Seem to Be Afraid of Everything!,"This shark is afraid of everything when he finds out that he is not as afraid as he thinks he is and discovers that others can be afraid too. A very cute children's book, especially as a read-aloud for parents."
