2,Great light with a major design flaw!,"As the other reviews have stated, this is a great headlight. Bright, water resistant, comfortable. Perhaps a bit heavy, but that's OK.The problem I discovered quickly was in the ratcheting mechanism. It is the serrated mounts that allow the headlight to swivel up and down for aim. It is way too weak and there is NO way to tighten it! Because of the weight of the light housing and the bottom mounted ratchet, the light has an awful tendency to flip down! You cannot run/jog with this light because every step causes the light rotate and face straight down (or in your eyes!). You cannot go hiking with it. One hop off a rock and the light flips down. I cannot use it in canyoneering. IN a waterfall the water just pushes the light down immediately.I'm a very mechanically oriented person, but the only solution to this would be to glue it in your ideal, or straight upright position. But then you cannot get the batteries out!Still looking for the perfect headlamp......"
4,Good camera for a Good price,"I have been using this camera for almost 3 years now, and I can say that it's a little workhorse most definately useful for family videos and can handle small projects for family, friends, and if you need to make a video on the cheap to get into a film school! It's a 1 CCD and it shows, and the quality of the CCD is also not the greatest, but hey what can you expect? :) I despise the fact the tape loading/unloading is from the bottom. But all in all you get what you pay for- some nice additions are the headphones AND microphone jacks, IEEE 1394 and USB, memory stick capability, MPEG recording, and even USB streaming! It's a good piece of equipment- I'm happy with it."
3,Sony DCR TRV18,"A good small digital camera. Video quality is good. Still pictures are not the greatest, but as a starter camera combining video and stills, it is OK. Only problem is when I tried to download the stills from the camera, the USB driver provided did not work. Windows XP was unable to recognize the driver and am still waiting for Sony's reply to my request for a driver."
1,Bad tape technology,"Before you buy, think about the cost of the DV tapes. They are about $6 each, retail, and EXTREMELY fragile. One broke in my camera, and damaged something when being taken out. This was a $70 repair, while it was still under warranty. I don't know how much it would have cost after warranty period was over. If I had it to do over again, I'd buy a camera with a sturdier, cheaper media, and from a manufacturer that respects its warranty."
5,Pretty good camera,I just bought this camera last week .I never touched camcorder before it is very easy to figure out how to use it .Picture is very good like you see in regular tv excepts you are going to be in it .I am disappointed with 8Mb memory stick .I would have liked to get 256mb free instead of spending another 4o bucks at sony .With usb cable and software (free) i transferred images to pc this software little clumsy but not hard to figure out .I dont think mpeg movieis ok you can't record more than 5 min with free 8mb memory stick .If you want to transfer the movie to pc from tape you need to have I-link (Not free) software and cable .Remote is little funny you to place before the cam corder for that to work .Initially i thought that is not working .To wrap it i will say it is pretty good one .
4,"Overall, a good identification book for aquarists","This is a very nice book-good quality, nice pictures, etc.-, but lacks somewhat in its valid identifications of certain fishes. For most species covered it is an excellent all around reference book. There is some excellent detail given in some portions to specific breeding, behavioral data, and general husbandry information that will prove very important. Some species however, are not identified correctly. Most of the fishes that I encountered in the book that had been mislabled were mainly rarer fish in the aquarium trade. So, these flaws probably won't affect you, but beware. If you are looking for a good informational book on freshwater aquarium fishes this is an excellent book to purchase, although I would definately suggest buying all volumes in the 'Aquarium Atlas' series."
5,best aquarium book,This is the best book about fish and plant species that I know. Good stats and very extensive book every way. Pictures are good or at least ok.
4,Addictive and sweetly entertaining.,"A gaming engine that was years before it's time. Mingling AI technology, infinate possibilities and brilliant adorableness it's a game you really won't want to miss. But beware, these little norns will capture your heart and test your willpower to put it away."
5,The best parenting book ever written!,"Throw away all of your modern day, psycho-babble, parenting books and magazines. This book is for ""real"" people. The co-author, Kay Willis, has successfully raised 10 thoughtful, responsible, caring, loving children by using common sense, laughter and love. I bought this book as I was preparing to have my fourth child in less than five years. My life is, in a word, CHAOS. Something made me pick up this book and I haven't put it down since. I read it over and over to remind myself of the 16 steps. By the way, it is the first book I have successfully completed since I began having children (there's no time to read!). However, I read a few pages of this book every night before collapsing from the day's exhausting events. I cannot tell you how this book has helped me to stop screaming and threatening and begin listening to my four little boys. This book is full of pearls of wisdom. You will love it and buy it for all your friends who have children. I did!"
3,"Stuff you know, but good to hear again","I almost didn't make it through this book because it starts off by telling you to take time for yourself and the author explains how her mom paid for her to have a sitter in the afternoons so she could sit at a girlfriend's and decompress, or how her husband would bathe the kids every night. I liked the later chapters better, but didn't hit any epiphanies. Maybe my expectations are too high for these books."
4,Store cheaper,"Fram is a known name, I thought I got cheaper at Amazon but it turn out the auto part cheaper. If I would known that I would got it at the auto part store in my city. I wish amazon would charge lower price than auto part store. Product wise is good product. Thank you."
4,Basics for Counciling in a Biblical World,"This book is wonderful material for helping those who want to help God's people. Some people start off counceling by trying to get the Christian to pray more and read more. Dr. Crabb takes counceling beyond these basic steps and challenges the heart behind the sin (Matth 5&6). Dr. Crabb keeps counceling simple and helps to give practical steps in removing ""sin's decietfulness"" as well as effectively using the Bible to change someones life."
4,Look at me! Look at my cap.,"This book is basically an extensive glossary of screenwriting terms, and will help the beginning (and the experienced) screenwriter make sure that his or her screenplay is formatted correctly and that it uses the correct terms. The book is arranged alphabetically, so if you need to look up ""Fade In"" or ""Margins,"" you can turn right to the correct pages.The book lists a lot of terms, however, that you should never use in a spec script that you just want to show to producers and investors. Use this in conjuction with other screenwriting books to get a better idea of this.The book is not always perfectly written either--and don't let its title fool you into thinking it has anything to do with Strunk and White--but it is helpful, and when I'm writing a screenplay, I use it often."
4,A Useful Manual,"A Useful ManualAlthough this book tries to capitalize on the reputation of the Strunk and White Elements of Style, by using a similar cover, you can forgive the marketing ploy, because it really is useful for those who have no previous experience on screenwriting.It's not a bedside reading type of book. Instead it is a guide to keep by your computer, while dreaming of creating the next silver screen blockbuster screenplay. It will help you to give your creation a professional look.E.C.B."
1,Really old information,"I bought this book last week. It is very short and an easy read. Mainly a reference book.It would be ok in hard copy but it SUCKS on the kindle because it does not have hyper linked table of contents. The table of contents is picture of a table of contents and difficult to see. Impossible to use as a reference book.I have read a lot of screenplays, I work with a group of writers, and I have some of the basics. The basics listed in this book are a very old form and not in use anymore."
1,Product can't be used to create databases,"I bought this product with the intent of analyzing certain industry sectors. Unfortunately, information from the CD cannot be downloaded into a database for cross-referencing. The first response to my call to the manufacturer was ""Where did you get this number?"" I was later told that I needed to buy the Deluxe version."
1,Not what you are lead to believe.,"If you are planning to use this for mass marketing, be aware that you are limited in the number of contacts that you can export. After that, you must pay the company again.For mass marketers, this is a very useful tool. However, the methods this company uses to promote itself and it's products are surprisingly shady."
4,clever and funny,"I expected a book that features a heart shaped locket on the cover to be, well, schmaltzy. But this is actually clever, and fairly realistic.Blissful Joy wants to be everything her actor parents aren't: practical, organized, and sucessful. At the top of her class, she is thrown for a loop when she receives a bad score on the PSAT's. With the SAT's looming ahead of her, she knows she must do better to get to an Ivy League. However, in finding a dog, she is taken on a journey of self-discovery wherein she learns she isn't so different from everyone else afterall."
2,Review of Paralegal Practice and Procedure: A Practical Guid,"As an individual who was very new to the paralegal profession, I found that the book was only minimally beneficial in that many of the explanations and legal terms were not clearly defined or explained...It definitely left me feeling like I needed help from other sources..."
1,Not helpful at all.,"Everything in this book is too general to be of any practical value, especially if litigation is not your practice area."
3,Sort of OK,I've seen and shown the Ho Chi Minh Trail video till I just couldn't stomach the leftist pro-communist dogma in this film any longer. It's a shame this videographer couldn't have been more center of the road in his presentation. There is quite a lot of good footage in this particular video if you can tolerate the outrageous comments from the narrator. I've found the 'Lonely Planet' video on Vietnam with Justine Shapiro much more to my liking.The Salt Road gets an A+ from me.From the Baltic to the Black Sea is plain boring.
3,Not too bad.,"This book made for a, well, interesting read. If you get it, just keep reading. It will all make sense in the end, sort of. Had some very funny lines it."
2,"""Bondage Scene"" NOT COMPLETE!","I just got my copy of the DVD R-Rated version and yes the best parts of the bondage scene are missing. Why those edit happy bozos would remove the lower body scenes showing the actresses powerful legs around her captor and leave the breasts showing is beyond me. Since this scene is most appealing in the way the Original version first displayed it in 85, to take it out in my opinion degrades the movie entirely. I was completely dissapointed in this version of the movie. If anyone saw the unrated 1985 Vhs version you would know what I mean. Lana was the movie. Why remove it????? I have [not a] clue!!! Unsatisfied customer."
3,lana lives on,Lana clarkson always gave it her all in any movie she was in. This is not a great movie but a acceptable low budget sword and sorcery movie.The print looks half way decent too. Sadly Lana was murdered by Phil Spector the music producer (he was convicted of it too) and is no longer with us; but her earnest performances in this and other low budget movies still survive. She had enough talent to make this seem like it was more important than it was and she will be missed.
3,"Barbaric, But Fun","Barbarian Queen is not the best sword and sorcery film with Roger Corman's name attached to it. As far as I can tell, that would be Deathstalker 2. Still, if it's nudity and violence you want, Barbarian Queen has it. It needed more, though. There are moments where nothing interesting happens, and in a 71 minute b-movie that is unacceptable. But this is a pretty fun movie, overall. It could've been very fun, though."
5,Not Deathstalker but very good,I like the barbarian queen movies as much as I like the mid deathstalker sequels not touching the first or 4th one but as good is about 2 & 3 of deathstalker I wish they would take it easy on the rape scenes .....a little t&a but god all in all not bad
3,A sketchy book about llamas for children,"I bought this book thinking it was a serious discussion of llama uses and the details of these uses, it turned out to be a whimsical and sketchy tribute to llamas by someone who clearly loves these animals."
2,Children's Book?,"When I bought this, I thought it was for adult readers while the content is more suitable for an 8 - 10 year old llama affectionado. Still an OK guide."
2,Llama Bedtime Story,I purchased this book hoping to find out more about these animals and what they were used for around the world. I was disappointed to find that the book really catered to a young audience or someone with a short attention span. O.K. book for children. I ended up donating the book to our local library.
1,Extremely disjointed and unorganized,"Reading this is like listening to the rambling stories of somebody not entirely in their right mind. Confusing and not ordered at all, and I have no idea why it was published."
5,The best Bible encyclopedia that I've read!,This book has everything you could want from a bible encyclopedia. It focuses mainly on religion and history. It has a book by book discription of each book in the Bible. It talks about ancient cultures and civilizations. There are color markers on the upper right hand corner to help you to find what you need to find on other pages in the book. It has large lifelike pictures and illustrations. The questions and answers in the book are interesting. It is just a good all around book. I defenately would recommend this book for anybody who want to understand the background of the Bible as much as possible.
1,Illegal for use in the United States,"This radio is illegal for use in the United States--either as a Citizens Band unit, or as a single band amateur transceiver. It is not type certificated for either use by the FCC, and is considered an ""Export"" model for sales and use outside the US.The intended purpose of this radio is for illegal power output on the Citizens Band Channels (as clearly evidenced by the channel 40 and frequency clearly visible), and illegal ""freebanding"" in the frequencies between 11 meter CB and 10 meter amateur band.N4PRT"
1,Not worth getting caught,"This radio is not legal for CB use and you need to have a FCC Amatuer License in order to legally purchase this radio. If you operate this radio you may get away with it for a little while, however WHEN you get caught you will realize that it was not worth it. The fines are very expensive. GF."
3,"BEWARE .... radio is *not* made of Ham, but rather made of plastic.","I had wanted to get a radio made of ham for an anniversary present, but unfortunately I didn't read the product description properly. This also isn't actually 10 meters big, I was hoping for an approx. 30 foot in circumference radio made of ham. It's much smaller than that and fits on a small desk."
2,Not what I expected,"Ordered this to replace a similar 25 year old lamp. We didn't want to spend a lot but thought this might be a little better quality than the $50 Target or Walmart type. We were wrong. Lamp has a cheap looking finish with a cheap paper shade and the long stem is a two piece affair with a seam in the middle. Naturally it is made in China. Guess we should have known better than to buy something like this on line. The company, Lamps Plus, was good to work with and provided a refund with no problem but we were out the $30 parcel post shipping (FedX or UPS would have been $60)for the return. We'll end up going to a local lighting center and spending $500+ to get what we need."
1,Too exspensive!,I really should have looked at wal-mart before purchasing these balls. Although the quality is good and the colors are nice...the ones sold at wal-mart are equal to quality and 1/4 the price.
2,Cheap balls,The balls are very thin plastic which I doubt will hold up very long. They are so thin that most of them came with dents in them that I can not get out. I would spend a little extra money to get better balls.
4,"They dent easily, but my Daughter loves them","I bought these to go into my Daughters indoor tent. They turn the tent into an awesome ball pit. She loves diving into it. I only gave them four stars because they do dent and get that 'smashed in' look, but they don't get totally crushed. My Daughter doesn't mind the dents, so I don't either. I'd recommend these."
4,Quality and Funny Balls,"This balls have a great quality, but i need buy another 500 balls... i must complete this for my baby... meaby i can find one pack of 500 balls."
4,A good Resource,"I have I & II now. This follows the same format as 1 but has descriptions of each creature. The Art is still B&W.; I have become very spoiled with all the color WOTC puts in to its products. The Art is good for the most part. My other complaint is there are too many water creatures. I have been playing for 30 years now and have only met 1/2 dozen water creatures. I think they can just stop with them already. They are a waste of space.The Big pluses are the Templates, new monster feats and some planar info on where some of these monsters might hail from. All in all the extra info makes up for the wasted space. Some of the Devils and Demons are cool as well as some new undead and some new SU/SA abilities.I want to see more Epic level stuff."
1,does not work,the dvd does not work. tried playing it in three different dvd players none of which could read the dvd. waste of money at least it was only a couple dollars.
3,Disappointed,"I was disappointed with this movie. I did not expect the surfing coverage of ""Endless Summer"", but I expected more plot than ""In God's Hands"". Unfortunately, this movie was less than either. The actors definitely had greater skills and there was some plot, but it was more like ""Porkys"" meets ""In God's Hands"". If you want the good parts, you have to go about 90 minutes into the movie. In fact, you might want to do that after watching the intro until it gets slow. I liked the (very brief) aerial shots and some of the tube shots. Overall, though, I was disappointed."
3,Better than most,"As far as fictional surf movies go, this is pretty much the best of them. This ofcourse is being compared to lame movies like North Shore, Point Break, In God's Hands, and all those stupid 60's beach party movies. I don't consider movies like Endless Summer I and II in the same genre as any of these movies. The ES documented actual surf adentures with real surfers. Like I said, Big Wednesday is probably the best fictional surf movie out there. I still think many scenes were very cliche and overdone. I am surprised at the majority of reviews. Either they are really high or down to just one star. While I don't think this movie deserves 5 or even 4 stars, it still is an enjoyable film."
2,Surf Film,It was an ok movie covering issues of 60's & 70's. But I was expecting more surfing footage.
5,experimental cult classic,The twenty reviews I read (with the exception of the negative responses) sums up the impact of this film and it's following therefore this is a message for the director and company that owns the rights and may put it out on DVD. Restore the cut footage and give it the theatrical treatment it deserves with any extras you can give.Both as surfer and independent film buff this film broke alot of rules and still made a longtime impact. So do it right!
4,the stuff of legends...,"I watched this the other night for the first time. It is a classic and a legendary film. A coming of age story for 3 friends who are legends on the beach as the best surfers around. Their exploits in the water and out of the water make them legends but this is a coming of age story and as they get older what they leave behind in their carefree days is what makes growing up so hard. William Katt, Jan Michael Vincent and Gary Busey are great and Sam Melville as Bear is excellent. The bond of friendship between Katt, Vincent and Busy drives the film as they navigate their lives between surfing, Vietnam and getting drafted, jobs, pregnancy, family and death. What they always had was the waves. Surfing was their bond. The surfing scenes are incredibly shot. The story moves slow at times and the drama is not always riveting but ultimately like a long lazy summer day this film pulls you in and left me exhilarated."
4,Personal memories,"For those of us who lived this period it brings back so many memories. I graduated from high school in in '63, was raised near Malibu and grew up surfing with Jimmy Blears, Mickie Dora and Johnny Fain amoung others.This is a movie about lasting friendship, that just happens to be set in the surfing world."
5,Just a Lemon next to te pie,"This is the best surf film ever made. Great characters, great story, and in an era where surfing was still simple and getting started as a sport. This film is more about the culture than the surfing itself and was very well done. Definately worth watching and this would be a great gift to anyone who has ever surfed."
1,Won't fall for this trick again!,I wanted Toothbrushes not flossing brushes. I think I paid $10 for a bunch of flossing brushes and ONE toothbrush. When I ordered the original Sonic Clean Between toothbrush I threw away the flossing brushes. The are cheap and don't function properly. I won't do this again!
4,Fun Hardwood Top,This a high quality traditional toy. My 8 year boy loves it. Took a while to get it spinning but now he's an expert. Gets 4 stars because I believe the tip won't last very long and there doesn't seem to be a way to replace it.
4,Big Al,"I have had this recorder for nearly a month now and have transfered a number of video tapes to DVDs. And so far it has done everything it says it will do. I have had no problems with any aspect of the recorder. I particularly like the all write aspect. It will record on almost any disk + or -. And the Guider option makes everything very easy to manage......even for a novice like me. The editing is great. To put labels on the disk it gives you a keyboard that it easy to use.I had a Magavox previously and almost immediately it started to have a variety of problems ending with my returning it and buying the Lite-on.I would recommend this product. For the price you get a recorder that does what the more expensive ones do.......only based on my expereience, better."
1,Horrible,"I got the product after over a week of waiting and could not get it to work. (no picture would appear), so I sent it back and after 2 more weeks went by I was sent another one of the exact same and the exact same thing happened (no picture would appear on screen). Finally I just sent that one back too for a refund. Based on the 2 individual experiences with the same brand and product being defective I would not recommend this product to anyone."
4,Needs more connection types and DUAL-LAYER support!,"Why make a DVD recorder that does not support dual-layer media? This is my big gripe with the thing, and the fact that it has no optical audio or s-video outputs. My playing performance has been very good, and its recording has been better than expected."
2,I mostly want a player..,When I saw this at Costco for $129 I could not pass it up. I was really just looking to replace a DVD player but for the money I thought it would be nice to get the recording feature too. This does not have optical out and no s-video -- as other reviewers pointed out. The reds are very bright and odd looking-picture is not as good as it should be for dvd playback. DVD's don't whow time-remaining so when I'm watching I don't know how much time is left on the DVD.
5,Examines all sides of this horrific incident,"Worse Than Death: The Dallas Nightclub Murders And The Texas Multiple Murder Law by Gary M. Lavergne (Director of Admissions Research, University of Texas - Austin) is the straightforward accounting of a 1984 multiple murder in Texas - when Moroccan national Abdelkrim Belachheb walked into a restaurant and shot seven people, six of whom died. The confessed and convicted defendant could not be sentenced to death due to a quirk in the state law, and could only be given life imprisonment - arguably ""worse than death."" House Bill 8, the ""multiple murder"" statute, was passed directly in response to the case. Worse Than Death examines all sides of this horrific incident, including the legal, political, and cultural debates concerning it. This criminology and judicial case study has direct relevance to present day concerns about violent immigrants and our contemporary legal system nationwide."
3,"Good perfume, but not the original I knew","Some years ago, I bought Samba natural and was looking for another one. I found this one, but it's not the same as the original I knew. Although, it smells well."
1,The worst he's ever made.,"I have been doing Billy Blanks Tae Bo for years. I bought 30 Power Rounds because it was on sale here on Amazon and it had pretty good reviews. This was the most unorganized workout routine I have ever experienced. It seemed as if it was totally made up on the spot. There are 8 moves and you do 3 or 4 ""rounds"" of each move. There is no set time for how long a ""round"" is, it appears to be totally random. So it is very repetitive and boring. You just get so sick of doing the same move over and over again.There is a lot of starting and stopping. Alot of ""walk it out"" and ""take it down"". The background crew spends about 50% of the video hopping around and high-fiving each other and going ""Woo! Alright!"" This makes it difficult to get a good cardio workout out of this video. I had to do a different Tae Bo DVD after this one just to feel like actually worked out that day. Don't waste your money."
5,Baba and Mansour Seck ROCK,"I saw Baaba Maal in San Francisco at the Maritime Hall a couple weeks ago... Oh my god, they rocked so hard. They played for a couple hours, but I got the feeling that when they left the stage they left because the *crowd* was too tired to continue, not them. They seemed to get more energy all night long.If you have a chance to see these guys live, DO NOT MISS IT. Also, SF Rhythm Collective that opened for them rocked. Good to see the guys up on da stage!"
5,This is an absolutely superb release.,"It is clear from listening to Baaba Maal that he is what I would term a ""musical sponge."" That is, you can hear the influence of so many different types of music in his own. In this regard, Baaba Maal's music is everything ""world-beat"" music should be. Indeed, he is one of the few artists whereby after hearing him for the first time, I went and purchased all of his recordings within a week or two. I'm looking forward to seeing him perform in person."
2,Bleeds for fountain pens,"The pad itself is good for ball point pen or pencil, but I bought it b/c I like writing with my fountain pen.What a huge disappointment when I tried it with my fountain pens and it bled through.I have another Mead Cambridge pad, and it is outstanding; absolutely NO bleed through, but this pad, for whatever reason, is not of that same quality.If you are getting it for your fountain pen, stay away from this pad.For ball point pens and pencils, it is fine."
3,different style but worthwhile,"This book was a bit of a departure for McBain. It's crime fiction, but not one of his addictive 87th Precinct novels, nor part of the Matthew Hope series. Instead, this one was about a burglar and his buddies; an assortment of thieves, hookers, and even a ""square"" or two. The blurb on the back calls this ""one of the most powerful and gritty novels of his career,"" but I think that's being overly generous. First published in 1975, this is a good read, but the dialogue is quite dated and overall the novel lacks tension and the usual dollops of humor that lighten up McBain's 87th Precinct books. I also thought the ending to this one was disappointing, lacking any sort of real surprise or exciting climax. Actually, there was a slight twist at the end, but not one that added much to the story. For McBain fans, this is worth picking up, if only to compare it to his other non-87th Precinct novels that he wrote under both the Ed McBain and Evan Hunter names."
5,Larry McMillian's Option Strategies Course,"This course shows you Larry McMillan at his best. His suspenseful presentation will keep you alert and interested at all times. He shares his lifetime secrets of trading options with you. He discusses predictability such as volatility, trading systems and analyzes the ins and outs of how to trade options. Larry tells you what works and what doesn't. He is considered by many in the field to be the #1 option master in the world. Don't miss this opportunity to learn from the Master."
5,Right On Brother!,"This book should be required reading for all new law enforcement officers. Veteran officers should find it not only interesting but helpful as well. It really tells it like it is! If you want to know what a cop thinks, read this book. As a retired West Virginia Deputy Sheriff I speak from experience."
3,My Ears were Blown Away!!!,"Loose harmonies & da bomb beats dominate this album. A power house of casio Keyboards (I think) & free for all vocals! Awesome depth to these cliche lyrics really hit home, even if your home aint all dat big, your eyes will be when you hear dis TNT! Kaboom!"
3,Pretty Good Flick,"Jason Statham and Saffron Burrows definitely make the movie. A great heist movie wherein you want the crooks to get over, mostly because of their savvy and vulnerability. The movie has a great plot and some surprises. It can be a little bloody toward the end, but without that, it wouldn't be as substantive. Recommended."
4,The Bank Job,"Hello.I am sorry to say that you have sent me this great movie in a wrong region code, code 1, so I can not watch it on my Blu-Ray player.This is the third time that has happend, even though is says that it's all regions or region 2I am very disappointed because of that.Thank you so much.Kind regards from Geir Hjoerenvik."
3,Good not great,"It was a good movie but not great, I found some of the nudity disturbing and out of place."
4,One of my favorites of the year; simple but well done,"Old school heist movie, based on true events in 1971, where there was no cool gadgetry ala 'Oceans 11'. Just the old-fashioned way of digging a tunnel and blowing things up. Well directed, acted, and great pacing makes this a real pleasure to watch."
5,First Rate Heist Flick,"""The Bank Job"" is an adrenaline rush from start to finish. Generally these type of films don't work for me because the capers themselves aren't really that interesting. This film, however, brought to my mind such classics of the genre as John Huston's ""The Asphalt Jungle"" and Stanley Kubrick's ""The Killing"". I think the reason for that is the aftermath of the heist is the most interesting aspect of the film where interested parties other than the police, such as the underworld and the Crown, try to nab the culprits. This film is also a step forward for Jason Statham. Statham, the unofficial king of the Labor Day weekend movie dump (see ""Crank"" and ""War""), gets to work with a prestige director like Roger Donaldson here and carries the film in glorious fashion. For those who don't mind a little rough stuff this flick is not to be missed."
5,Must see,"If you are a Jason Statham fan, enjoy British film/tv or just like to watch a captivating movie this is a good buy. It usually takes me 10/20 minutes to pick out a movie but Jason never let's me down."
3,lots of unnecessary profanity and nudity,it took over 30 minutes of boring film before getting to any real action. way too much nudity and profanity that didn't add to the film storyline
4,Grim and gritty,Not the usual caper movie. And that's good. Truth is stranger than fiction. The entertainment comes as the dumb threaten the arrogant. The evil punish the careless. And the quick outwit the establishment. A marriage survives. And the details are still out there.
2,Very disappointing...,"I was very excited to see this movie after all the great reviews I read. What a huge disappointment! It was not entertaining in the least, and the audience is never made to care about any of these characters. In fact, the characters don't really care about each other, either.There is a sad lack of humor, action, or even a light at the end of the tunnel. Who are we rooting for in this film? I'm not sure really. It was a sad disappointment, especially since I was so interested in seeing the film."
4,Good Movie,This is a solid choice. I like the story and the actors. Kind of edge of your seat action.
3,I would rent it first.,Interesting story but I personally feel like it could have been made better. The trailor is a lot better then the movie. Probably my least favorite Jason Statham film.
2,"OK, but...","I found the action a bit like a ""set in the UK"" version of the Ocean's XX trilogy. A little deja vu for me. What did intrigue me was the claim that it was based on a true story.There are better movies of this genre out there, at least for me."
2,Not What I Expected...,"I thought this was going to have hard-core action, but I didn't know it was about stealing safety deposit boxes, and in one of the boxes, has pictures of a royal princess getting naked and getting gang-banged by some black guys! It was just alright. If it wasn't for Jason Statham being in it, I probably wouldn't have watched it. I wouldn't recommend THE BANK JOB!!!"
4,A Cinematic Gem,"Inspired by the notorious 1971 London robbery, ""The Bank Job"" (2008) adds a political Pandora's Box to the traditional heist genre. The results are enormously entertaining, with solid performances from Jason Statham, Saffron Burrows and David Suchet (as the ""Porn King of Soho""). Director Roger Donaldson contributes some of his most assured work - an ideal blend of seediness and intrigue. No ""Rififi,"" but well worth seeing."
3,A Good 'Job' but Lacking Narrative Cohesion,"A well paced flick with plenty of tense moments and a preponderance of twists, The Bank Job makes for a decent movie experience.However, the pacing and twisting can't conceal that the film suffers from a lack of focus, both in narrative and theme. I felt Bank Job couldn't decide whether to be a light-hearted caper like 'Snatch' or a gritty crime drama like 'The Departed'. It attempts to be both and fails to be truly excellent at either.The cast of characters grows quite quickly, and we don't have enough time to care about all of them as much as the film needs us to. The central love affair is also lacking. There are many such loose threads in Bank Job which show promise but are watered down and create nothing more than disorder.A promising film that entertains but is ultimately forgettable. The special edition has some deleted scenes as extras, but they don't flesh out the movie. Standard DVD includes wide and full screen formats."
2,ok flik,"Statham is always great, but this movie was slow and boring. The only good part is that its a true story. And the English accents drove me crazy.If you want a great movie, its not this one. Watch Street Kings!!"
1,Boring,"Within the first ten minutes of this move I felt that it could be a waste of 90 minutes of my life. I was right. Simply put, there are just better movies about bank robberies. Such as Inside Man, with Clive Owen and Denzel Washington. The Bank Job is very thin on plot and the development of the story line is slow and boring. In addition, there is not any real action scenes to speak of. Not in the traditional sense of blowing stuff up, cars chasing down the streets and fights, that is what keeps people entertained. This movie rocked me, to sleep that is and made me second guess what I was watching it in the first place.Since this movie is partly based on a true story I hope that the real bank robbery that took place was a lot more fun and adventurous than watching this movie. Because overall there was absolutely nothing captivating about this movie."
1,Horrible,"But, if you liked Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels or Snatch (like my husband) you will love it."
4,3 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Though its title makes it sound like a generic genre exercise in the tradition of The Italian Job(s), this thriller is actually far more grounded in realism and brutality than you would expect and makes for a surprisingly satisfying motion picture--unformulaic and possessed of a convincing 70s aesthetic, it's a must watch for those interesting in heists."
5,Unexpected,I bought this because of Jason Statham and was not disappointed but found I was profoundly surprised at how much I enjoyed the whole film.
4,Fascinating Special Feature,"Among other features, the disc includes a mini-documentary, ""The Baker Street Bank Raid"", on the real life bank robbery. The documentary includes photos and audio (in the movie the crooks end up having their radio transmissions recorded by a ham radio operator) from the actual bank robbery. It's fascinating to see and hear details of the actual robbery in relation to the movie. A great movie with great special features makes this a Blu-Ray worth owning."
4,Swinging Sixties with a little bank job,"Action man Jason Statham typecast here as a tough guy once more, aptly so this time, heads a team of amateurs and professionals in a wee little heist that would allow them to retire comfortably.Except for one problem...actually it's quite a few. Apparently, scandalous photographs of utmost importance got stolen and they are of royal and political implications to this robbery.Roger Donaldson does a fine job directing this tightly edited crime thriller. It could have been another nifty heist film, except that once the heist is over, that's where it gets more interesting. Half-way through the film, all sorts of double-crossing, skulduggery takes place, with each party with its own agenda trying procure what they want.This Blu-Ray edition does a good job showing the warm colours of sixties London in its full monty. It does help that Donaldson recreated the setting and the atmosphere to stay true to its period."
4,"Kaleidoscopic Funk Collision, Volume 2","Just slightly less excellent than the previous volume in the series, Gimme Shelter, Paint It Black is nevertheless another exciting compilation of forgotten soul/funk tracks from the early `70s which dip into psychedelic rock.The Chambers Brothers start things off with the classic ""Time has come today,"" presented here in its full mix. Undisputed Truth remakes the Temptations track ""Ball of Confusion,"" and producer Norman Whitfield (who also produced the Temps version) lets the session musicians stretch out to their full acid jamming might on this super-long track. Africa gets all weird on the Rolling Stones standard ""Paint it Black,"" turning the song into a chanting dirge, and the Supremes add a little extra funk to the Beatles classic ""Come Together.""Discovering forgotten artists and songs is what these compilations are all about, and I can only hope Harmless continues to release volumes in this excellent series."
5,The perfect book on movie comedians and movie comedy:,"No one understands and appreciates movie comedy better than Leonard Maltin, and here he has written a book on the subject that is simply perfect. His enthusiasm and love of these comedians and their comedies is infectious, and he gives us a giddy yearning to watch the movies he cites. If one is an aspiring comedian, too, this is an inspirational book, filling one with the wonderful possibilities of making an audience laugh. It is difficult to fully describe the unpretentious, simple manner in which Mr. Maltin nails down the very essence of comedy in these pages. How often those who write about comedy smother their subject with detailed theories on its socialogical and psychological implications. Mr. Maltin understands better than anyone the subtle art of analyzing comedy without killing it, making his book an absolute joy."
3,Informative but Disappointing,"An important book about the politics, corruption and development of artificial feeding, and its fatal (and often lethal) shortcomings compared to exclusive breastfeeding. While I would recommend this book to anyone even contemplating children, I can't help but be disappointed with it at the same time. A subject of so much importance deserves a work (perhaps two or three very different books) of greater clarity, focus and substance."
5,Great recordings and performance,"These 1974 recordings were better quality than the ASMF's 1971 and 1977 recordings, and more or less the same as the 1980 ones of lesser known overtures (in which there are unfortunately no hidden gems). So Pentatone have chosen the best quality album from the set of complete overtures. Having said that I haven't heard this remaster but I hope it is better than the mess Pentatone made of the Beethoven Symphonies with Leipzig Gewandhaus and Kurt Masur, which were not as good (having been completely dried out) as the original Philips CD masters.Performances are excellent - tight and loaded with vivacity without overdoing it. 5 stars for that, hopefully the remastered quality is equal."
2,Dictionary,"Ordered it end of Nov., but have not received it yet. So cannot review it yet. Hope it gets here before Christmas!"
2,"no compatibility, slow operation.",The new Windows Vista operating system on this machine will not run some of the programs which I own and were made for XP.This computer as sold becomes too slow to operate with the new Windows Vista operating system.All the other features are good.
1,Toshiba A-135 Beware,"I bought this product from and through Amazon in March 0f 2007. When my kid went to reboot it, it asked for a bios password even though the bios was never passworded. This was listed as a Toshiba A-135 message. This thing is a ticking timebomb for anyone who needed information stored on the machine.I am told that an authorized Toshiba dealer will make the necessary repairs for free. Of coure, if Amazon or Toshiba had told me about it, I might have been able to do this when convenient rather than on the 4th of July. Until this time, I agreed that it was a good laptop that simply required adding more RAM to properly run XP."
4,Great Collectors Item,I ordered this from a distributor associated with Amazon and paid extra for expedited delivery. It came within 5 days and I figured that was because of the Holidays. The address label showed it being shipped from Walmart. This concerned me but the contents were in good condition. It was sold as new and I am happy with the order. The dust jackets are perfect but the outer sleeve had a little crushing. These books are a great addition to any collection. I bought them to replace the paperbacks I had that were damaged in a flood. I can't wait to start reading them again.
4,Nice Book for the price.,"This was a nice book for the price. The binding and paper were as expected for this price point, and the book was well packaged. The print quality was adequate."
1,Mediocre at best...,Regarding the Leatherette edition: overpriced and of mediocre quality. There are many older versions out there that are far superior. Try snatching one of them at an antique bookstore or something. Or just go for the nice Folio edition.This 'leatherette' version is just fat and ugly.
3,Not all it's cracked up to be,"Yes, of course the book is marvelous, among the most remarkable ever written.This edition, however, is not as great as it should've been. The leather doesn't feel like real leather, the color should always be red (think red book of westmarch... what were they thinking.) and the thing is just too big to hold comfortably and sit and read.The print is nice, the maps are great, the slipcase thing is nice, but I think the 3-volume edition with the Alan Lee illustrations is superior... the books are red, like they should be, they're bound in VERY durable cloth bindings, the paper and printing is good, the illustrations are nice, and because it's in three volumes, it's comfortable to sit with and read. Plus it's less money."
1,Collectors beware,"Ok so the world is a big place and it's full of strange people but I am surprised that anyone could be very impressed with the ""Leatherette"" editions of LOTR and The Hobbit. These particular editions are not ones I can imagine any discerning collector would want to own.I bought the two books because I am not a fan of Alan Lee's work and I couldn't find any other current hardback editions that used Tolkien's original drawings, (as the ""Leatherette"" Hobbit does). The truth is though that these are the most tacky and tasteless editions I've seen and the print and paper quality of both books is very poor. The colouring of the drawings in The Hobbit is a disgrace and numerous pages in my copy of the LOTR were so smudged they were unreadable.Don't buy them if you haven't already and if you've already made the mistake send them back with a complaint and write a scathing review to try and save someone else the trouble."
4,"Beautiful books, but not for casual reading","These books are simply gorgeous. They are top-quality, with glossy paper and come in a very sturdy box. However, they books are a LOT larger and heavier than I expected, which is fine, but would definitely make reading them difficult. It would be a burden to have to carry them around, as each individual book is surprisingly heavy. However, they are great collector's items, meant to last. I bought them because they look nice, and I wanted to own a better copy of this magnificent series other than my old beaten up paperback editions. (I will still use the paperbacks for re-reading, though!)Even so, they are wonderful copies, and I highly recommend them if you are looking for a nice edition to collect or display. I think it would have been better if they made these books more practical, though, as nice as they are."
1,"Great book, dreadful edition","As so many others have said, this is not a ""Collector's Edition"".A real collector's edition has: a quality binding that will stand up to multiple readings; readable, consistent print that is correctly aligned on every page; acid-free paper. This edition has none of these qualities - don't waste your money. Strangely enough, the collector's edition of the Hobbit IS a quality product.Someone should bring a class action suit against Houghton Mifflin for passing off this ""book""."
3,Too weak cover for a BIG thing,"The book is great, no need to discuss that. And the edition is very very fine, one can definitely get superior aesthetic pleasure reading it. It would be five stars.But the cover is too weak. After finishing reading first two parts (""first volume"") of the LOTR, I found that the inside bend of the face cover started tearing apart (some two inches). So, definitely, the book is intended for very careful, not everyday, reading. This is amiss."
1,Why can't I just buy 'the two towers' !?!?,"All I want to buy is 'the two towers', I all ready have the 1st book on paper back so I have no reason to need the hole set on my kindle. I'm a college student with not enuff money to buy all three books. I saved up for a very loung time to get a kidle thinking it would save me money in the loung run. Not rip me off by forcing me to buy hole collections of books, when I only wanted the one!"
2,Very mixed feelings,"On the one hand, I appreciate the amount of effort (roughly Tolkien's whole life) that was spent on creating Middle-Earth. Yet I have to say, regrettably, that I think Lord of the Rings is grossly, grossly, overrated.The dialogue is execrable. The poetry and songs are (largely) grating. The descriptions are (largely) uninspired. Most of all, the characters are as tangible as a Ringwraith without a cloak.It can't be that it seems cliched to me (it is the first - and last - fantasy novel that I have read). It can't be that I am too cynical (I thought The Hobbit was excellent). It's just that this fat lump of a book is plain poorly written. Sorry, Tolkien fanatics."
2,"Why people love them so much, I will never know.","Many people belive these books to be some of the greatest books ever written. I, on the other hand have read the Lord of the Rings trilogy and do not believe them to be that good. Sure the story portrays a classic theme of good vs. evil, and the plot is a good one. However, these books are slow moving and not very exciting. In fact, the books are pretty boring overall. There isn't enough action and there are usually long, drawn-out conversations. I really don't believe that these books are worth reading, and if you really want to know what they are about, watch the movies. They are excellent and a lot more exciting."
2,I was let down.,"Ladies and gentlemen, there seems to be a confusion regarding which edition we are evaluating. The book advertised is a paperback, and you are talking about the rich leather binding -- on a paperback?As to the content, the only reason I read it is that everyone I knew had read LOTR. I was curious, and ordered the book, only to see that in order to understand the book (I like to read first things first) you had to read The Hobbit. In my opinion this is like a fairy tale, and I think adults are too old for fairy tales. I care much more for realist literature, or books that write about someone strange, like The Stranger, by Camus; or Sartre's Les Mots. Also, LOTR is too long. Even Anna Karenina (and that is great literature) is shorter. The only reason I read LOTR is that I'd heard about Bored of the Rings, and wanted to read it."
3,Good but hard to read,"I believe this book is the best seller book of all England (behind The Bible). But I bet half of the people that bought the book did not finish it. It's hard reading all the way, because Tolkien was really eager to develop a credible and whole new world to be like a mithology, so he spent pages and pages describing the ground around the characters.Also, justo one question: WHY THOSE RIDICULOUS SONGS???!!Also, it's alittle bit too hard to like characters that eat so much and sleep so much (hobbits)"
2,Two Towers is good,"I read this as a kid and here's my general recollection: The first book is insanely and unnecessarily tedious. The second book is quite good, easily the best of the series. The third book is so-so; I never finished it, though. The Hobbit is better than all of them.Tolkien was a below-average writer with an above-average imagination."
5,The Lord of The Rings,"Read it! If you're anything like me, you'll love it. NOT FOR THE FAINT OF HEART, 3,000 pages long."
5,The Lord of the Rings (50th Anniversary Edition),"Just wonderful! From one beautiful golden edged page to the last, it was pure joy. I will treasure it always."
5,Lord of the Rings Audio CD,"The story of the Lord of the Rings is a classic that I do not need to praise as countless others already have done that.The audio CD of the story (by Mind's Eye) brings the story to life in a new and exciting way. All major characters have their own actor speaking the parts and the voices fit the characters extremely well! I have heard other books on CD, but this is the best I have ever heard, and I cannot think of a story more deserving of this quality.If you love the Lord of the Rings, then do yourself a favor and get the Lord of the Rings Audio CDs. You will not regret it!"
2,don't get this confused with an unabridged book reading,"This is the radio version of the the Lord of the Rings trilogy. It is not the unabridged reading of the three books: Fellowship, Two Towers, & Return. It is a 12 cassette dramatization. I was very disappointed when I realized what I'd bought as I was looking for an unabridged reading of the three books."
5,This gets better with age...the trilogy's and the reader's.,"If you were one of the millions who read Tolkien's great trilogy years ago,do yourself a favor and pick it up again. The classic tale of power, good, evil,and ""the quest"" loses none of its power. In fact, having not partaken of the trilogyfor over fifteen years, I think it is better than ever. It is timely, entertaining,meaty, thought-provoking, and fun...and the good guys win!You don't have to be a devout Middle Earth fan to rediscover Lord of the Rings.Read it again...for the first time."
5,Incredible book,"I've just started to read The Lord of the Rings in English (I'm Spanish) and all I can say is that this is the best edition of LOTR in the world!!! It's totally awesome, a great buy for Tolkien's fans. Absolutely recommended"
3,the lord of the rings:one volume,bought this book by mistake nothing wrong with it but already have the book learning to use my new toy
3,not my thing,There was something about the author's style that just didn't click with me. I found it a little heavy-handed and dense. Although I am probably well in the minority here!
3,Could be a lot better,"It's the only complete reading of LotR out there, so it will have to do. Rob Inglis does a wonderful job performing the lighter roles. His hobbits in Hobbiton are outstanding. He also does a good Gollum (which isn't a light role). He's probably a good character actor. However, the dramatic renderings are frequently given in a frustratingly sing-song, randomly-inflected tone. It's like he gets bored or something and resorts to reading rather than performing. Tolkien, who wasn't a professional performer, per se, did a much more stirring job in his informal sample recordings, presented in The J.R.R. Tolkien Audio Collection. I wish someone could do for LotR what Jim Dale does for Harry Potter. Granted it's a long, complex slog, requiring a vast number of voices, however this story deserves more than it gets here."
5,The Fantasy Book of Fantasy Books,"No other fantasy author creates the same depth of a world as J.R.R. Tolkien has done. His labor of love took his entire lifetime to blossom into the Lord of the Rings, and the depth and beauty that each word of this timeless classic possess is simply breathtaking. I've read it five times through, and am currently savoring a sixth reading and I find myself appreciating it more and more each time I read it.I especially enjoy opening the book to particular section and re-reading a few lines of Tolkien's beautiful and calm prose; or to reflect on the careful linguistic contruction that Tolkien put in to create his multitude of languages.This is simply a wonderful book, and once you've read it, it is a joy to go back to the Silmarillion and learn of the ancient tales that are only hinted at in this book."
5,The Start of a World,"Fantasy is such a sprawling genre, filled with lots of average, but entertaining books. Tolkien, ever since the publication of LOTR stands out. He didn't really write a story - he made a world. A fantastic world, rich in history, magic, myths, and life. The Lord of the Rings is a part of that world, and it FEELS like that, part of a greater work. Truly one of the best books ever written - I loved it."
2,"Very nice, but...","It's true Tolkien is THE king of fantasy, but this book is too slow motion. I really liked the characters and the journey, but sometimes it seems there is nothing else to read than ""they got up, ate a few, walked a lot and slept"", so i found it quite boring, and i finished it within 3 months, which is quite unusual for me. Worst of all is i think the first chapter, if you don't know nothing of tolkien's world you get completly lost with the Hobbits history!!!"
4,Overall the Better Edition,I've listened to both version at this point the BBC and this version (Mind's Eye or American) and think that this version is overall the better version. One of my main complaints about the BBC version when I bought it after my tape version of the Mind's Eye wore out was the audio quality which can make it hard to hear.When I recently found and bought this new packaged version I was very pleased the story while short appeared to follow the story as J.R.R. Tolkien wrote it much more faithfully than the BBC version. The voices are clear and reasonably distinct enough that after listening for awhile you have no problem knowing who is saying what. And most importantly the audio does not randomly go up and down in the in this version which it did in the BBC version which at least for me made the BBC version hard (and sometimes painful to follow).Better version overall
5,Dream...,"I LOVE THIS BOOK.... and that's no understatement. I read this book over two days non-stop the first time I read it. The world that exists in this book is as beautiful/scary/adventurous as your mind will allow it to be. The book held me in its spell and I could put it down only after the journey was complete. If you like this genre, then you'll read it anyway... if you don't like this genre, then pick this up sometime and you'll be converted :) Happy reading..."
5,fabulous,"Best to read ""the hobbit""and ""silmarillion"" first as primers to this great piece of writing. ""Rings"" is a great saga of mythmaking on the grand scale of Celtic and Norse tales which every serious reader should read. It is as much a requirement as reading Proust, Joyce or Kafka. A joy from beginning to end."
5,A true Epic in a convenient single volume,"The single volume edition is both a blessing and a pain in the neck. The epic, one of the best ever written, is such a gripping story that once I begin reading the story (over and over) even from the middle I just can't put it down until I've read it through to the end.This means, however, lugging the heavy and large volume around, whereever I go. Separate volumes make this process easier. However, the joy of having everything in one place, the entire story as one book (as it was meant to be) is great.I spent too much time reading the forwards and notes concerning the various editions and corrections made to the story from print to print. I would recommend putting that off until you finish the main story (perhaps a few times). The appendix and notes following the story adds much to the experience.Once you finish the story, do read the Silmarillion."
3,"Wonderful work, Poor Recording","I bought this CD version of TLOTR in order to introduce the story to my wife as we went on a road trip from Texas to Colorado a few years ago.Although both this and The Hobbit were true to the original story, the dramatization (apparently done by the BBC) was poor and lacked emotion. The audio value is bad, with volume problems. The music was at best loud, at worse bothersome.Still, we listened to it, and my wife was introduced to two classics of literature.(this review is for the boxed, CD recording of the books)"
1,A terrible abridged version of a great book,"I have just listened to part of this in my friend's car and I am disgusted. Not only is it the worst written abridged book I have ever heard, they have terrible sound effects in the background. It is also very irresponsible of them to let the actors pronounce at least 80 percent of the names wrong, they said Sauron as if it were spelled Suron. They said Gimli son of Glo-in instead of Gloin and the list goes on forever. Annoying voices were given to all of the hobbits, especially Sam. I recommend the BBC version or the unabridged version to listen to...Reading the books works too."
3,Great book... regular edition,"First, this comment is about the edition not ""the book"" which I am a fateful fan.The edition as a cover and as a set is ok but When you open the books you see that paper isn't quite white and the letter are not very clear. I'd have liked a different fonts'choice. I am not saying that the edition is bad, not at all, It's just not good enough for a book you pretend to have in your personal library for many years.I hope this warning can help you."
5,The Lord Of The Rings,"I have read this book at least 4 times. I really like books with magic and mystery. This book also has friendship and shows what people can do when they come together. In this story there is a lot of jumping around from one place and time to what's happing some were else at the same time. There are also a lot of strange words, and for all of you who have read the hobbit this story is much more organized. The hobbit seems all most childish compared to this. I think this is a really GOOD BOOK and you should read the whole series."
5,Childhood Fantasies,"These books captured my imagination like no other books ever have. Tolkien's vision is astounding. His ability to use words to paint such an enormous and vivid picture is without equal. I cannot get enough of Middle Earth. Although these are fantasy novels, everything is so real. There is no way I can do justice to Tolkien's masterpeice with these few words. Middle Earth is a place where childhood dreams, nightmares, and fantasies all come true in bright, vivid colors."
5,Super Awesome,This book looks and feels fantastic. It arrived sooner than expected and is undamaged. Best thing is the last time I saw it for sale it cost twice as much.
3,This is not the full version!,"Be careful! Some of the reviews that display for this item are actually for other Lord of the Rings products. It can be a little misleading! This is the abridged version of the trilogy with a total of 10.5 hours of audio time. It's a great product but if you're looking for the 55 hour unabridged version or the critically acclaimed BBC dramatization, this is not it. Keep looking."
3,Mediocre,"After listening to this Audio reading, I was more or less upset that I could not really follow along with the characters, such as Merry and Pippin sounding the same. Over all the tale itself is a delight to follow along with, but as expected, the sound effects are less than amiable with it being recorded in the 90s. When Gandolf uses his staff, or shows himself as Gandolf the White, I thought my ears were going to start gushing red, for I had to have it louder in volume because of the voices being at different ranges all the time. Other than not really knowing who is talking, I am able to follow along, but only because I have watched it's Epic sister, a Peter Jackson creation of TLOTR. The story is enticing and well worth it's purchase, which is why I've deemed it a 3 star review."
2,Most serious Tolkien fans will find this disappointing.,I don't really like this production. To me the characters are all wrong. They way that elves are depicted seem very childish as opposed to being noble. Didn't like the portrayal of Bombadil either. Most of the characters are either over the top or come across as slow witted. If someone were first introduced to LOTR with this production he would be put off from reading the books and miss out on what a great work LOTR is.
5,Great Stuff!!!!!!!!!,The Lord Of The Rings is the best series ever written. J.R.R. Tolkien is the best writer that ever lived and should be never be forgotten .
2,Not at all what I expected,"For some reason, when I first looked at this product, I thought it was recorded in the 1990's. I was wrong though. After hearing the first disc, I googled it and it appears this is from 1979. It shows as the sound is, to me, poor, and the effects are weak.I look forward to getting the BBC version recorded in the 80's as I hear it was a lot better production."
5,Simply my favorite LOTR Edition I own.,"I love one volume editions of series, and this did not dissapoint. Very well made and I love the type setting and font chosen for this particular book. The appendices maps, charts, etc have super clear printing, and honestly I like not having the old fold out maps. Make sure you buy a dust jacket protector as the paper for the jacket is brittle, and might tear. Other than that great printing. No need to critique the book..."
5,A Really Well-written Novel,"This is the Kindle version of the novel. It uses the page number location as well as the locator number (less useful). It has the usual table of contents to go to when you've either lost your place or want to skip chapters you're not interested in.The novel itself is very well written and is worth reading again, especially if the last time you read it was in high school, or you've seen the movies and need to review some of the passages you feel the movie(s) missed or glossed over. Good fantasy."
5,nice book!,I like having the entire trilogy at my finger tips and the beginning goes over somethings that i hadn't seen before in the individual books. Plus what a bargin getting all three books for the price of one; on the kindle this is great as the actual book is bulky and a bit cumbersum to handle.
1,Mixed up order,"The three volume set shipped included two copies of ""The Two Towers"" and no copt of ""The Fellowship of the Ring"". Having dealt with amazon customer support before it was easier just to have their mother buy the absent copy at Wal-mart."
5,A Timeless Classic Everone Should Read,"I first heard of ""The Hobbit/The Lord of The Rings"" when my father read ""The Hobbit"" to me when I was in about third grade. Soon after, I saw the cartoon movie (though I don't think the cartoon did the book much credit). Then, again, when I was in eighth grade, I read ""The Hobbit"" because I was told we had to read a novel for reading class. This time I liked it even beter. No, let me rephrase that, I loved it. Then, I read ""The Lord of the Rings"" for the first time. I loved this book even more. It is the epic story of a world facing damnation, when, everyone comes together and rises up against their opposing force. Tolkien paints pictures and creates emotions that make the book feel real. I didn't want the book to end. When I get time, I am going to read it again."
3,Wordy...,"I just thought that this trilogy overly comsumed by words. it was a novel that could have been about three-hundred pages shorter in mimd. I finished the book, out of determation and interest in it, but found that At times I didn't think I'd ever get through it... the movies were the thing that made me most interested in finally reading it, outside of four years of three of my best friends Raving almost daily for their love of this book. I guess that fanasy isn't my thing, although I do get into it, I just like more the ainti- hero Novels more. All in all, it was a good book, wordy yes, but I can't take anything away from it's statius as a classic."
1,Not what I wanted at all,"I wasn't paying attention when I purchased this set. I meant to get the unabridged reading of the books and couldn't listen to more than a few chapters of this. The voices are terrible, cheesy and unlike who they're described to be, the musical interludes are long and dull, and so much of the description and explanation is edited out that it's hard to follow. However, I love the books and wanted to hear it in its entirety, so if that's what your looking for than definately go with the narrated version by Bob Inglis - so good and he does all the voices spectacularly (it also helps that he's English)."
2,Not what I expected,"I guess the fault was mine in choosing this product. I didn't notice that it was a dramatization. I thought I was purchasing the complete Lord of the Rings trilogy read word for word. I think the product may be OK for those wishing a dramatized version of the trilogy, but I must warn that much of the content of the book is lost through this dramatization."
4,Lord Of The Rings,"I started reading Lord Of The Rings in primary 6 and I finished at the beginning of primary 7. It tells the story of Frodo Baggins, a hobbit. It starts by telling you that it is his birthday when some of his dwarf friends tell him their going on an adventure and they want him to come with him. They will meet many strange and wonderful cretures and people on their way. This book has to be one of the most famous ones in the world as is the author, J.R.R Tolkien actually died in the middle of writing it so his son, and he did his father proud as the ending is one of the worlds bast. I'm a harsh man so getting 4 out of 5 is pretty good, I would never give anything 5 out of 5."
3,Average.,"Dialogues have been lifted from the book, without enuf story in between. Story moves too fast. Hard to tell difference between voices of different characters."
5,Your life is not complete without this book!,"Tolkien has got to be the most imaginative and gifted writers of all time! I just finished reading this trilogy for the second time now, and plan to read it again in a few years (by the way, I'm 14)! The story in itself is absolutely incredible, but Alan Lee's paintings add a lot, being very beautifully detailed. This book is a must for all imaginative people who seek the enthrallment of fantasy - engrossing for adults, teens, and children (although the reading can be rather challenging for kids under 12 or so). Tolkien was a genius!"
4,As expected.,Bought this edition for my wife. Each volume is heavy and the pages are a little glossy. Illustrations are not very colorful.That said she still likes it very much and will do so for years to come.
5,Houghton Mifflin hardcover boxed edition,"The Lord of the Rings is simply one of the most magnificent examples of story-telling in the English language. This is not a review of the literature, but a review of the Houghton Mifflin hardcover boxed edition. Having read The Lord of the Rings five times previously, and having lost my dog-eared paperbacks, I decided to splurge on an expensive edition for my sixth tour of Middle Earth. The weight of these tomes and the high quality illustrations made for a very nice renewal of acquaintance. My only complaint is the paper. It is too glossy, and reflects the incident light too much. Otherwise, this is a terrific effort."
1,"Terrific Contents, Poor Printing","I will not elaborate on the contents of J. R. R. Tolkien's masterpiece, others have done that much better, just read some the remaining reviews. Instead I would like to give my two cents to this specific edition: while it is dubbed as ""Collector's Edition"", I had to find out the hard way, that it is not really set in new type but only photo-offset from another edition which leads to an irregular print with lots of flaws in the appearance of the different letters. If you know the book, just compare pages 6 (photo-offset) and 7 (conventionally set) for excellent examples of blurred acharacters vs. clarity and excellent readability. In my personal view, this is not the standard I would expect from a ""Collector's Edition"" let alone from the price of this book. - I am extremely disappointed."
1,Review of Kindle edition,"I've been reading and re-reading Tolkien for 45 years and have numerous editions of the trilogy. When I bought the Kindle it was the first book I bought. Sorry, the Kindle version is very poor. Ebooks often are in want of good proofreading but this has a staggering number of typos (proper nouns without capitalization, misspellings etc.) The maps are also missing from this version. For the price they could have done a much better job and honored Professor Tolkien's work."
2,Not what it seems,"Probably my fault, but I thought it was unabridged - hard to tell in the ad that it's abridged. You can't effectively abridge three books that are 13-15 hours each to 3.5 hours each. I donated it to the local library."
1,BEWARE THIS EDITION!,"Lord of the Rings deserves a beautiful edition, and this is NOT it! The ""Millennium Edition,"" which looks so nice in photographs, is in fact small (each volume is about the size of a trade paperback), badly printed on poor paper, and exceedingly shoddily made (the first time I opened a volume in a bookstore, the binding split right through). The volumes are not even real hardcovers, just paperbacks stuck in thin, skimpy covers of shiny board.I REPEAT: this is a lousy edition, grossly overpriced! Beware of it! You'd be much better off with a set of paperbacks you could replace for $15."
3,"""New"" Book comes with scratch.",The book arrived in the mail on time. However there was a noticable scratch (about 6 inches long) that went through the plactic wrap and marked the case. It looks like someone got to it with a box cutter.
5,Excellent book to read,Have read this classic many times and have always enjoyed it. If you loved the movies you'll love this book
5,J.R.R Tolkein,"What's not to love! It has been several years since I originally read this book. Having watched the movies countless times, it was nice to go back and reacquaint myself with the original story."
5,Great book,"I'm finally reading this! The book is amazing. I have never read a book in which the author has put so much effort. As for this edition, everything is indexed, from people to songs, and all of the original appendices and maps are included. Every lover of fantasy should read this, and this is a good edition to do so."
5,LOTR - Kindle,"Oldi, but goodie. Decide to reread for the 10th time, but this time on Kindle. Easier to read without the huge book."
5,Thank you for putting them all in one version,So excited to see all three books together in one digital version. Add the Hobbit and you have the start to a wonderful reading adventure
2,used is used,"Obviously I knew buying used books would have some wear. This set was supposibly in 'good conditon'. When recieved product there was a huge coffee stain on one book, old reciepts and role playing cards stuck in between tons of the pages in all 3 of the books. A little disappointed and mislead by the seller. Will not purchase from them again."
3,Missing disk!,"Don't get me wrong, I love this book, this audio CD version as well! So far...I too have TWO disk 15s and NO disk 16!!I waited MONTHS for AMAZON.CA to finally admit they couldn't get it, finally ""lucked out on AMAZON.COM and now this.I am SERIOUSLY displeased!"
1,Bring on the BBC!,"Having purchased and listened to both the Mind's Eye and the BBC audio versions of The Lord of the Rings, I implore Tolkien fans eager for some aural splendor to put their faith in the BBC and skip this dreadful reenactment entirely. Ian Holm and the rest of the BBC cast are superb. With the exception of the much mourned bombadill banishment from the saga, the BBC's attempt is far superior storytelling that will enliven your imagination as opposed to forcing you, as is the case with Mind's Eye, to forever equate Samwise with a castrated smurf."
5,Amazing,"I am 16 years old from UK I read The Hobbit when I was 10 and I have now read Lord of the Rings about 5 times in the last 3 years it is superb. You are gripped right from the start and you just cant put it down. The characters are amazing in their own right from the elven archer Legolas to the great wizard Gandalf, everyone should read this book there is a whole world in there... After finishing the first part of this masterpiece you will be mesmorised at the greatness of it all you will love the characters and the adventure that they take. READ IT."
2,The Hobbit stories,I was not taken with the Hobbit stories and have no really good reason why not. I am a big fan of sci-fantasy as a general rule.
2,Excellent world building....pity about the execution,"I have attempted to read the 1st book in this trilogy on about 5 occasions over the past 15 years and I never get beyond the Council of Elrond before I yet again find the whole thing too boring to continue.I loved The Hobbit and admire Tolkiens vivid imagination, but his style of writing in LOTR is just too ""early 20th century british"" for my liking. I have the same problem with Dickens that I do with Tolkien; ponderous prose! I guess I've been spoiled by many of the excellent sci-fi/fanatsy authors (i.e. George R R Martin) that write edge of the seat, gripping & fascinating stories.Unfortunately, in LOTR, Tolkien's ability to tell an interesting tale seems to have taken a backseat to his world building."
5,Why does it have to end,"When you read this book you are immersed in a world of make believe,every aspect is interestig,then you look at our world and think ""how boring"".My point is that the book is ful of strange dark places,mysterious and too be discovered but our land is known and explored making it very boring.The book is too short and hen it ends you are sad too have too face rality once more."
5,It was awsome,I believe that the lord of the rings was one of the greatest books ever written and that it should be given every award that a book of that greatness deserves.
5,the epitome of fantasy writing,"Fantasy is written to tell a story, to transform reality into a mutated form where anything is possible, and yet retains a connection to the here and now. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings, an epic saga of the unending conflict of good and evil, takes the reader into such a world. The story contains mystical and unreal aspects to create a fantasy, but retains a link with the believable to retain its link with the reader's world. The vivid and flowing descriptions of Middle-Earth surrounds and immerses the reader into Tolkien's imagination, where he guides you through a tale that is gripping and unforgettable."
4,''Lord of the rings'',"I like this book because it is exciting,thay fight all types of creatures.It seamed like you were in the Book/movie,like reel life.I relly liked this book because it has adventure.When thay fight the goblins thay use any thang thay could find.The ring will be destroid, thay are detormined.Thay will beat the king.I thank the author did a vary good job making the carcters & creatures. the setting was good also, like The Mines of morea & The forbidden forest.This is a wary good book."
5,Super adventure story,"I thought the movie was great! But it was kind of scary.I cant wait until the next movie comes out. I hope it dosn't be sooooo scary as the first one.When I saw the last part of the movie, i thought it wasn't finish. But it was! I thought frodo and his best friend was great. My family thought the movie was great. I dont know why the movie was scary? But it was good. I dont really like to see scary movies,but i wil get use to it! Every time there are scary parts in a movie. I start to jump up in my seat! I like the part when Ian Mc kellan had grabbed frodo's friend.That part had made me laugh so bad. I am 13 years old. I thought he movie was great, but also scary!"
4,Lord of the Rings,"This book is probably one of the best of all time. It is the first stepping stone for all the fanstasy novels written today. J.R.R. Tolkien created a world very much our own, though masked with many fictional things,and characters. He created vivid realm with characters that the mass public could relate to. The ring of power signifies mankind's own self corruption and destruction. While the ringbearer signifies man's own salvation. Frodo (the ringbearer)embarks on an epic journey to desttroy the One Ring, which he recieved, to save Middle Earth. During his adventurous voyage, had to overcome many hard-impossible obstacle to keep the ring from the Dark Lord Sauron and destroy evil (the one ring), once and for all. I highly recommend this book to those who love fiction and understand the problems in our world."
2,Kindle version is NOT the book version,"Lord of the Rings is one of the few books which is always present on my bookshelf, and was the first book I decided to purchase on my Kindle several weeks ago. I was pleased with the formatting and the inclusion of several images such as that of the map and the door. The largest disappointment however for the Kindle version were the typographical errata: misspelled or truncated words, employing the wrong case for proper names (poor Eomer) and in at least one case a Greek letter starting an English word.An additional feature which would have enhanced the Kindle version is the text-to-speech accessibility, which was surprisingly missing. Foreign language versions were also not available. These points are however small compared to the obvious mistakes in the text, which make one question how faithful the other content is for the Kindle version compared with the original books. While I love the original text, I cannot recommend this version."
2,Lousy rendition.,"Despite the fact that this is shown as being published in 2001, the copyright dates first from 1954. There is a reason that other versions have come out since this one: this one isn't good.There are different readers for different characters, and some of the voices are really jarring. Frodo, to my ear, is completely wrong. In addition, it is poorly abridged. One of the most remarkable things about Middle Earth is how wonderfully imagined it is; all of the details are described so lovingly. Not in this version. Here, almost everything is dialog, so you are given little idea of what anything looks like. Some of the most cherished quotations (for me, at least) are mangled. In all, very disappointing. I remember hearing the BBC's dramatization years ago on radio and thinking it was wonderful job on very difficult material. I certainly wouldn't say that of this version."
2,Quality Misrepresented,"If I hadn't been led to believe by Amazon that this edition was ""leather bound"" I might have been satisfied with this volume, but I loathe deception. My son collects leather-bound books and sueded-paper is not leather. I even talked to a representative who said he would send the leather-bound edition and sent me the exact same product.Shame on you Amazon!"
2,Stupid,You're charging twice the price for the EBOOK than the soft-back version of the book. I find this backwards and annoying. I find it equally annoying that no one else has stated this.
2,I honestly don't really like it!,I feel that the different voices used to portray the different characters don't fit.. and overall not the best fit for me...
1,Lord of the Rings--Millennium Edition,"First: Amazon's rating method--i.e, that all editions of the same work are included under one rating thread--is useless. This Millennium edition is a rip-off--cheaply bound, printed on cheap paper, small print (paperback-like), no illustrations--DON'T buy it--buy one of the well-establishhed, illustrated hardcover editions. Tolkien's work itself, of course, rates all the stars there are."
1,Not wort your time.,"As I fan of Lord of the Rings (the books and the movies) I was quite excited to recieve this for CHristmas. My excitement died within minutes of placing it in my CD player. The voices, aside from the narrator, do not seem to fit the characters. Espoecially disturbing were when the high elfs had voices that sounded like Alvin, Theodore and Simon, rather than the noble creatures they should sound like, and Tom Bombadil sounding like a tripped out leprechaun. It also bothers me that almost every actor seems to be reading, so much so that you can hear the pause as they come to the end of a line or page, even if it is mid-sentance. And perhaps the worst thing is the way they mispronounce names and places. Tolkien gives a pronunciation guide in the books, they should have used it."
1,the BBC audio version is lame,"this BBC dramatization of lord of the rings was in my opinion poorly done at best 1 star i listened to a few moments only and the voice for Gandalf was so far removed from what i know of/understand of him that i couldnt bear to listen to listen anymore..now if a truely fine actor read this part( lawerence olivier? sir john gilgud ?liam neeson? Richard burton? etc etc- [ugh all those misspelled] would be quite different story- this is my brief review i would give it one star,but suggest others enjoyed it it seems so this is my opinion only ,recomend look at some other reviews posted at that site for another more favorable opinion .i strongly suggest instead- you should get the recordings of Tolkien himself reading -they are wonderful treasures- provide new insight into the beauty of tolkiens language not to mention how to pronounce some of those words properly- 5 stars plus !!!"
5,Hard to find books in this form these days,Books are not just about contents. A book is a whole object with its form and its contents. Here is one.
5,One book to rule them all ...,"One story all encompassing ..One quest for life or death ..One supreme evil, one chaotic good..Who among you could put down this book, even as Sleep crept up and tugged at your minds?One Ring To Rule Them All! One Ring To Bind Them!This is and always shall be the greatest fantasy epic ever written, to be read and enjoyed by anyone of any age. There is book enough for 15 year old and 50 year old alike."
4,"Veteran Lord of the Rings reader, on tablet for first time.","I've read this wonderful tale too many times to count over the years. With each reading, I appreciate even more Tolkien's amazing world of language, cultures and geographies, along with his wonderful ability to spin a story. It was convenient to have it in electronic reader form, but I missed the maps from the books. There is only a general map in the front and it doesn't do the job of the maps in the original three book set. Reading Lord of the Rings is like reading a historical account of a great war. Any such account needs maps for reference and context. For that reason, if you want the best enjoyment of this great story, get the printed versions."
3,"Review of 3 book set, cream color, landscape covers.","I was disappointed by this set. Although promoted as ""The Lord of the Rings J. R. R. Tolkien and Alan Lee (Hardcover - Mar 1988), the only illustrations were on the covers of the books. Also, the copy I received was missing the last 30 pages from The Fellowship of the Ring (the most important climaxes in the book!) and skipped straight to the index. I do not know if this is a publication error or if I just happened to get a bad copy, but I thought it better safe than sorry to get a different edition instead.If you want additional content like illustrations and the sort, this isn't the set for you."
5,so great,so cool...i loved these books and the movie was pretty good too. Totally awsome because it was filled with exticing adventures and cool charecters. IT was a great plot too.
5,Lord of the Rings --Leatherette edition,I have read these books at least 3 times each. I purchased the leatherette edition as a birthday gift for my daughter. I found the quality and cost exceptionally well worth it. At 2/3 the actual cost in a book store it was a great investment. I also purchased the Hobbit--leatherette edition as well. It arrives in less time than was anticipated. I would recommend these editions to anyone who is a real fan of the movie and a true Tolkien whether or not you have read them one time or many times.
5,The best and most complete movie tie-in version available,"This particular version of this truly epic masterpiece of mythology contains the corrected 1994 text (the missing ring inscription line of ""One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them,"" in THE SHADOW OF THE PAST has been restored), plus the maps of Christopher Tolkien's 1980 version have also been restored inside the hardcover's dustjacket (or on the inside covers for the paperback version). Probably the coolest movie tie-in cover yet of all the movie covers released.Very nicely done overall. Not too cumbersome to read for either the hardcover or softcover versions. The best one-volume movie tie-in edition yet released."
2,A paperback of this length is not worth buying.,I can not recommend the paperback version of the book. Spend a little more and buy the hardcover. A softcover binding is just not strong enough to handle more than four or five hundred pages. I would discourage anyone from buying the softcover version of any book of this length. After one reading the spine is beginning to crease and the plastic layer on the outside is peeling off. I doubt it will survive more than three readings.
2,LOR boxed set - 2002 Edition - disappointing print ink quality,"The books themselves are excellent quality but the printer ink on the glossy pages is light gray at best - not even close to black ink. Combined with the glossy paper, it would be a nightmare to read. I am so disappointed with this set. Was looking forward to another read through but it sure will not be with this set - do not want the eyestrain!"
5,My boyfriends loves it,"Bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas, and he absolutely loves it! From what I gather he is enjoying especially while he is deployed."
4,Great book but not leather,"It is a great book for the price and some reviewers may be right about the print quality being poor but my copy is very good. The only thing being is that it's not leather but rather pleather bound (plastic leather), which explains the affordable price."
2,Amazon synopsis Misleading,"I requested the 7 book series as a gift for Christmas, since the LotR is one of my favorite trilogies and I have a dog-earred trilogy in paperback. It looked like a nice set. Black bindings and the synopsis mentioned illustrations that would certainly add to my enjoyement. When I received the books, I found that the ""Millenium Edition"" had no illustrations and the binding was paper instead of the traditional durable cloth. I truly see this as a waste of dead presidents and wish I had just requested a new paperback version."
2,Better watch the movie,"Pages and pages of description of the landscape. Northwards this, downwards that, a tree here a hole there. I was basically losing my mind. I usually think the book is a better deal than the movie, but there is no point to spend so much time imagining so many different scenarios and nothing going on. I just didnt like it.Example:"" The Company now turned aside from the path and went into the shadow of the deeper woods, westwardalong the mountain stream away from Silverlode. Not far from the falls of Nimrodel they found a cluster of trees, somo of which overhung the stream""""The hills now began to shut them in. The Road behind held on its way to the River Bruinen, but both were now hidden from view. The travelers came into a long valley; narrow, deeply cloven dark and silent. Trees with old twisted roots hung over cliffs, and piled up behind into mounting slopes of pine-woods""And the whole thing is like that.GO WATCH THE MOVIE"
1,I was a Tolkien fan but I'm better now,"Admirers of Tolkien's work marvel at the man's capacity to create a vast imaginative world. He could certainly do that - whether he could say anything even remotely interesting with it is another matter. Tolkien appeals to the young and immature because his world is enormous, detailed, and clearly ordered, unlike our own, which is only enormous and detailed. So it's a very pleasant escape from reality, but in the end it's nothing but a padded playground for the childish. I blush to remember that there was a time when I'd learned to write in Elvish. This skill has not served me in later life. This fella wrote one good children's book and a tiresome three-volume novel for delayed adolescents; the flood of derivative and gossamer-thin drivel that has come out since his death is something I hope he would have been ashamed of."
2,Lord of the Rings,"I bought this set and had it sent to an inmate in a correctional facility in Florida. It apparently never arrived. This may have to do with prison policies on used books, but I never received any notice that the books had been returned or any reimbursement."
3,....,"I didn't finish the whole story, couldn't move on when I got to the second part of Two Towers about Sam, Frodo and Gollum. It goes without saying that Tolkien has done a great work creating Middle Earth, a world of fantasy, but huge number of characters in the book seem to be one of pitfalls for the book (in my opinion), the characters in the book do not have very interesting or deeper personalities, in my eyes, they are very straightforward. And, the books are unnecessarily long (it could be due to my impatient nature), and too much details over minor stuff. Sometimes, I just wonder is the trilogy that popular before the movies were made?"
5,I LOVE THE LORD OF THE RINGS!,J.R.R. Tolkien is my favorite author because he puts such intelligence and feeling into his books.He developed a real language that the elves speak. His plot is clever. His writing style is so descriptive and realistic that the reader feels like she/he is sitting in a hobbit hole listening to Frodo tell the story of his adventures.His characters are so well developed that they are very interesting to read about. Each character has a distinct personality from the courageous and loyal Samwise to the mischievous and cheerful Pippin. Tolkien's stories are very captivating and exciting to read. He has an extremely creative imagination. I never get tired of reading his books!by Julia Elder
5,Nice version,"I already have it in portuguese, but I decided to read again, but in english this time. That's why I bought this version and I am not disappointed.This version is very good. I mean, the quality of paper and cover are good. The story is the same, but the way they put into this version is nice.I recommend.Hail!"
5,Lord of the Rings,"I read this book at age of 12 in my mother language that is Portuguese, this work I consider that is one of the 20th century master works. Now I wish to read it in english to see all the skill of the author in the way he wrote it. This epic is full of meaning and exploit with mastery and deepness a lot of question that pursued and still pursuing mankind up to day."
5,A fitting edition for a classic tale,"I recently received my copy and, to my relief, it seems that either I got lucky, or the binding issues mentioned in a few other reviews have ceased as it arrived in perfect condition. As mentioned many times before, the fold out map is glued together so some care, preferably a razor of some sort, should be used to separate the folds to prevent tearing. The overall design is quite beautiful and I am torn between my desire to read it or keep it in it's pristine shape. Of course, as I purchased this for my own personal collection, I do fully plan to enjoy reading every last page as I believe that keeping care of the book is of course important, but a good book is one that has become worn by being read, not by the passage of time."
2,Not knowing when to stop,I love the quiet sinister beggining - up until bree this book is good. So thats all i recommend you read. After this point for all it's gratuitous description it becomes almost a synopsis - all the atmosphere is gone. this atmosphere almost returns in the mines of moria but is obliterated soon after by the elves. There are two reasons people enjoy this book 1) they read it all so don't want to admit it was a big waste of time and 2) they are those strange immature people who read sci fi/fantasy and haven't picked up a real novel once in their thus far wasted lives...
1,I hope the movie is better than the book.,"I hope the movie is better than the book. The book is not readable because of the overuse of adverbs. It just isn't well written. Quickly and quietly..., swiftly and quietly, etc."
2,The Most Over-rated Trilogy of the Century,"After hearing all the hype about the books and the movie, I expected a real classic. However, these books were more like a double dose of NyQuil. I can't believe I wasted 12 hours listening to these. There are far too many characters and the books jump from sub-plot to sub-plot so often that they never established my interest in any one thread. There was no action or suspense. I didn't see the movie but can imagine that it may have been more interesting with the help of the visual effects. This story seems to be perfect for a movie....it needs some kind of help. As it is, it's far from exciting and a ""Classic"" it's definitely not."
2,"Many pages, little of interest","This is a rather boring novel about a bunch of one-dimensional characters who are at war with a guy who lives in a tower. They are supposed to be good I think, and the guy in the tower is supposed to be bad. But as they all seem to have an equal penchant for fighting, and since we never get much insight into the tower-guy's personality or designs, it is hard to discern between them. Reading this book, I kept asking myself: Why couldn't the ""good"" just invite the tower-guy over for tea instead, maybe they could have become the best of friends?It is not that I dislike long novels. I love War and Peace, and Don Quixote, and Ulysses. Because they are interesting and well written. The Lord of the Rings is not."
1,Possibly the dullest book I've ever read,I thought the movie was rather good. After about 250 pages I quit.
5,The Greatest Book Of The 20th Century,"The Lord of the Rings is perhaps the best novel ever written in the history of the English language. Tolkien's genius lies in many places, not the least of which is in creating the most complete fantasy world I have ever heard of. It has its own history, mythology, and languages, and as you read the story you get the feeling that Middle-Earth actually exists. But Tolkien's true gift lies in the way in which he writes of human emotions, ironically by not using human characters. When one reads the story, one feels a greater connection to hobbits or elves then to men. And the character depth and complexety is unrivaled. Very few characters in the story have simplistic characterizations (i.e. are perfectly good or terribly bad). This is incredibly difficult to do, and it is very rare to find the author who can attempt this level of depth successfully. I sincerely doubt that I will ever read a book to match this one's greatness in my lifetime."
5,Deserves 6 stars!,"This is the greatest trilogy and set ever written. The Master of Fantsy, J.R.R. Tolkien, showed us his story-telling talent in these books. They deal with Bilbo's(the legendary hobbit from The Hobbit) nephew acquiring the ring of Bilbo's and his quest to destroy it. Men, Dwarves, Hobbits, Elves, and Wizards team together in a last and final stand againg the evil Sauron, in a tale that will captivate the reader for hours, and never leave him. Classic Good vs. Evil--but in the greatest form ever imagined. Essential for any fantasy lover, great for anyone else. I highly recommend it! (as should have been obvious by now)"
1,Sham Collector's Edition,Nice paper I admit it - but the print type is as splotchy and uneven as the cheapest of paperbacks. Don't be fooled. It is not a pleasure to read.
3,This new printing is missing parts of the story,I first read the three volumes of the lord of the Ring when I was a child back in early 1980. I have since lost the books from that time So I bought this reprinting of the story. I am sorry to see that key facts about the story are missing.Don't get me wrong this story is legendary and a must read. But as a collectors item it does not measure up. There are ommited or changed scenes changes in the book concerning the underhanded dealing the ring plays on Frodo in the Bar and what ever happened to the elven roop that Sam had? It was never used. Also a lot of the poetry has been removed.If you have never read this book before you will not know that I am talking about and so no worries. It really is a great story. I bought it as I wanted a copy for my liftime. It is a story that will last the ages.
2,great book bad edition,this book looks really nice from the outsidebut the fact is that the inside is pretty bootlegthe pages are really cheap and thinand the map they give you in the back is a folded sheet of paperit definetly is not worth 50 bucks but the book itself is amazing so get it if you don't want to haul around three books at once
5,I agree: ten stars.,"I'll read it again, and again, and again, in one language and in another. Life gets a new heroic point of view. This book is inspiration for art, for friendship, for all life. A masterpiece. The first chapters could be better (a little bit faster), but the whole book is excellent: don't give up in the first 50 pages, just keep reading. But don't read only this, the world is big, and there are many authors, from Shakespeare to Cervantes, from Borges to Ende, Chesterton, Tolstoi. Tolkien is not in these cheap fantasy author's level. Keep it in mind."
5,Hail to the god Tolkien,"When I was younger,I used not to read very much.In fact I disliked book.But one day a frind of mine gave the Lord of the Rings.That was it!It just tied me down.I couldn't do another thing but reading.I was teleported to another world.The Middle Earth!I became one with the book.I was so attached to it that when I reached the end I thought my life was empty.But nothing was the same again.After that my life has changed forever.NowI'm reading piles and piles of books trying to find an alternative to feel my emptyness,but I don't think I would manage it."
5,THE BEST BOOK IVE EVER READ!!!!!!!!,I accidentally picked up the first part because I had to for class.this would be the first book Ive read serisouly.After the first few pages I was captured in it and found myself reading chapters at time.The best book in the world!TOLKIEN RULES
5,One of the greatest books of all time,"I have read ""The Lord of the Rings"" over 20 times since 1973. I have a Master's degree in English and have read many great works of literature, but nothing else that I have read has woven quite such a spell as Prof. Tolkien's masterpiece. This book will touch your soul. It is a GREAT work of art!"
5,WOOHOO,WOOOOOOOOHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!it's like reading it for the first time all over again reading it with the leather cover. It's almost like the first time I -
3,Not the new Iliad !,"This is how i found L.O.R after completing it: First the Fellowship of the Ring is the most boring book of the three and i even must say that it had nearly succeded it turning me away from completing the rest,The Two Towers is the best and the most interesting book due to it's very clever writing style(something rare for the author!),the third book is a bit of the first and the second (that's intersting in the fist half and then bouring in the second!).but overall i think you'll enjoy the book ."
2,Lord of the Rings Trilogy Gift Set,"I listen to audio books frequently.The audio quality if 4 of 5 stars. The reader, Bob Inglis gets 3 1/2 stars. He certainly isn't the best reader around, but he is clear and understandable. His character voices leaves a lot to be desired. The packaging is really why I'm writing, it's really bad. The sleeves are poorly designed and if used will lead to scratched CD's. We moved our disks to aftermarket sleeves to protect them. The packaging is a joke compared to the Harry Potter series.Overall value 2 stars, this is a spendy set and I was expecting more.The reviews here are mixed up and as a regular Amazon customer I found this shopping experience one of my worst. Some of the reviews are for books, some for a different audio set. It's as if the Amazon folks didn't spend any time here sorting things out. I don't get it???"
5,Best gift ever,"I bought this gift as part of a set of wedding gifts for my friends, their cake had the one ring writing on it so it fit, and they absolutely loved it. Everything about the product resonated quality, especially the leather.Recommended for anyone who loves the Rings."
4,British version of 3-volume box set (red cloth),"The photo Amazon provides for this set is misleading. It shows a book that is very tall and narrow, perhaps a ratio of 2.5:1. Look at the dimensions given in the publication data section and you will see that this is simply the UK/HarperCollins edition of a virtually identical boxed set offered by Houghton Mifflin in the US. Both sets have identical jackets and Alan Lee color illustrations, and the box/slipcase also is identical. They are both very nice books, bound in red cloth with gold foil stamping, crisply printed on coated matte paper. But the Amazon price for the Houghton Mifflin is $48-$50, while this import runs more than 3 times the price at $154. Do the math and choose the US edition (they are both printed and bound in the same print shop/bindery, and since they look identical, are identical, save for details on the copyright page, why pay more, unless you are a dedicated collector with deep pockets?)."
3,LOTR and t he Holy Grail,"Tolkien's gifts are inspirational for artists. His poems are unique. Perhaps the only comparison is Defenders of the Holy Grail, which has many songs during the Crusader march. This book is lavish. The danger is you let someone else's image become your own."
1,"Bad Binding, broke at second read","5 stars or more to the Lord of the Rings, which I read many, many times.1 star or less to this edition (paperback with faded tower of Gondor on the cover ISBN 0395974682). It broke at second read, inspite of the fact that I treated it very, very gently.I read this specific volume once and it held up fine. Since then about two years have elapsed and it broke apart almost immediately after opening it. Loose pages everywhere.I'll have to buy a better edition.Possibly, next time I'll buy three separate volumes because one-volume editions are heavy to read while in bed."
5,Ahhhhhh totally the best book ever,"THIS BOOK IS THE ABSOLOUT BEST BOOK EVER. I swear if you read it you will suddenly fall in love with it. If you dont your just weird. I have made many people read it, and they absoloutly love them. A kid I know never reads a book twice, but not this one. J.R.R. Tolkien put soooooooooo mcuh work into it it is beond your wildest dreams."
1,Mind's Eye Audio Production is Garbage,"This version is horrid. The elves all sound like non-Tolkein ""santa-style"" elves, and I think they made Merry a girl (and probably Pippin too, from the voice. It's hard to tell). If you want an audio version, the BBC Radio one is fantastic, the best translation of Tolkein to another medium (including the stellar Peter Jackson movies). Get it instead; avoid this one like the plague."
2,This audio versions (isn't good)!,"My husband and I took this audio version (Amazon calls it the Minds Eye, but the publisher is Soundelux) of LOTR with us on a long road trip and had to stop listening to it before long, because it was so annoying. I love the books and the movies, but do yourself a favor and buy a different version. Frodo and Bilbo voices sound reasonable, but most of the other characters have weird voices. For example Sam sounds like a little boy (although, maybe his part is read by a woman?), Strider has the voice of an old time radio hero (you know that ""hear I come to to save the day type voice""). Actually, the whole thing sounds like an old radio version, which wouldn't have been bad, if it was done better. Plus the actors aren't really that good, so the mood isn't conveyed properly."
2,I want reviews for the KINDLE version !!,"Well I was looking for reviews of the Kindle version. I wanted to know if people were having any problems with this on their Kindle or anything I should know about. As far as reviews of the books go, I don't know why you would review them. you either like them or you don't. I've got more than my share of hard copies of these books so I don't care what you think of the Maps or the cover or whatever. I just wanted some INFORMATION ABOUT THE KINDLE VERSION !!! Amazon !!! Please stop mixing the reviews !!!"
5,LotR Kindle Review,I loved the books on paper and now I love them even more on my Kindle. Nothing can be better than that.
2,The Millenium Edition,"This story is by far one of my favorites. I read it several times a year, so you might be suprised that I am rating it with only 2 stars! The reason it received such a low rating from me is the binding of the book, and the poor quality of the printing would not last through one of my readings. I had to send it back. I have the paperback edition and have for years, and it has held up through a lot. I was looking for something to last even longer - this was not the right choice. I was expecting much more from the Millenium edition, but I guess I should have learned not to place so much on the millenium hype. I DO recommend reading LOTR, it WILL change the way you daydream for years... but find a version that will last with those years, because you wil want to return to this story..."
1,One-volume boxed collector's edition full of broken type,"Yes, I am a Tolkien fan. So much so that my family gave me the Lord of the Rings in the collectors edition, a box containing the three volumes bound together.I must advise against this edition. Although the cover is lovely, with gilt lettering and a faux leather cover, and although the book has black type and red page headings on it's thick smooth paper, I say don't buy it.There is no justifying a ""Collector's Edition"" with broken type on every page. If broken-type is not the correct term, forgive me. Only be aware that this edition has incompletely printed letters on seemingly every page.In a paperback edition, or if the broken type was rare, I wouldn't comment, but in a ""collector's edition,"" one should get a little more care in the presentation of the text."
3,Poor Quality,"The story itself if great, possibly the best I have ever read. The only problem I have is with the quality of the book. The books itself is small and hard to hold. The covers, along with the box cover, was made poorly."
5,Perfect!,"I bought the set for my mom who is a huge Lord of The Rings fan - she absolutely loved it. The books are really good quality and she enjoyed the maps inside. The maps fold out to about 2 pages tall and 2 pages wide. I would definitely recommend these books to anyone searching for a nice set - they are worth the money, by far."
2,totally forgetable edition,I don't understand why people here are giving this glowing reviews. The 50th Anniversary Edition COLLECTOR'S EDITION in black with a black slipcase is much better. This edition is small. The maps are small. The Alan Lee illustrated edition is better than this. In the 50th Anniversary Collector's Edition there is a big foldout map in the front of the book and another big foldout map in the back. Either the Alan Lee illustrated edition of the 50th Anniversary Collector's Edition are better than this. And why would they publish this 50th Anniversary Edition AND a 50th Anniversary Collector's Edition?
2,LOTR Minds Eye (sort of),"It is true that this is the Mind's Eye version that was broadcast on NPR playhouse as to the story content. However, it is a recreated version not using original full cast of actors, it does not use the original full symphonic music, and Gail Chugg is NOT the narrator. Also, it is divided into one minute segments that are spaced ten seconds apart. As originally broadcast on NPR Playhouse, the dramazitation include the background that is part of the story at various parts of the book. That is also left out. Soundlux Audio Publishing apparently simply paid for the right to record their own copy of the Mind's Eye script and used none of the Mind's Eye recording!"
4,Convenient,"I have read the Lord of the Rings over and over since I was about 12. It's handy finally having it all in one volume. This version of the book is not quite as nice as I would like, but it isn't bad, especially for the price."
5,What a buy!,"If you haven't yet got the books, and you can get the whole trilogy for this price - what are you waiting for? It will be long, and tortuous, and complicated but - that's Tolkien! He might not always be easy reading, but he is certainly worth it! One thing - it must be a pretty hefty volume!"
5,A five star no brainer,"Everythings already been said, and if there is anyone who has never read these books, then go and do so right now.Fantasy books started because of these, or rather this one. Tolkien wrote it as one book, the publishers wanted it as three books.All other fantasy books, author's, and so on are desendents of Tolkiens masterpiece.Frodo lives."
2,Problems With Words With Accents,"I have just read through Tolkien's forward and the Prologue, and have already found a number of typos in the Kindle edition. These have to do with words in Elvish or Black Speech that have accute accents (such as Dunédain or Barad-dr. I, too, hope that Amazon will correct and update the Kindle edition."
5,Greatest Literary Work of the 20th Century,"What can be said about the greatest novel of the 20th Century...except that it is so long, that it's broken up into three volumes. And it's so good, that it inspired a whole movement of fantasy writing. I wish I had a story like this in my head, waiting to come out."
5,I am not alone!!!,"I've allways thought that Lord Of The Rings was my own precious,my own discovery,my own friend; but I'm mistaken. After reading all the wonderful reviews, I know now that I am not alone!! I share all the thoughts of previous readers of (to me) the best book you can read.Over twenty times I have read all four (The Hobbit is as much a part), and I still find something new and wonderful. It is a lifetime every time I read the Lord of the rings and the Hobbit and thus the story stays real, along with a part of me. I,ve tried to discribe the story to anyone who likes to read,but I'm usually left gasping for words, for it is the amazing number of different feelingsI experiance reading the book that I love most. How can you describe a different world that sounds madeup to somebody? Only those of us that have read it knows it is real!!."
5,Perfect book for a collection,"That book is amazing!I don't need to talk about the story but that particular edition is really great.Tons of illustration, hard cover, ...It feels like reading an old book!Love it !"
4,"Beautiful, but flawed.","Tolkien was always first and foremost a professor, so the fact that these books often feel more like history books is not surprising. They are nothing short of genius in the world they build, but the characters are often bland and hard to care much for, and the dialogue is often dull. They are great books, definitely, and basically created the high fantasy genre, but they are not perfect."
4,Convenient format for a classic.,LOR needs no introduction or promotion. I found the ebook form quite usable to reread this grand old tale. Only problem - trouble to get to the maps.
4,"'Great' by virtue of age, not writing?","While Lord of the Rings is a good piece of fantasy writing, I hesitate to give it the unqualified 10s that most of the reviewers have so far awarded. Its most outstanding point is the fact that it was the parent of the genre and deserves many of its kudos for that.But much of its success is also derived from that. Realistically, if it were released today it would be well read but then disappear along with most of the good-but-not-great contemporary fantasy novels.In between some gripping storytelling and vivid characters the book drags and meanders. The two times I have read it it has taken me over a week (I'll read a really good book in under a day).Still, I'll probably read it once more just so I can again justify not giving it a 10 (and yes, I do give 10s - Ender's Game got one of only a handful)"
3,Bored of the Rings,"Acknowledging Tolkien's brilliance as a writer (he writes very, very well) and linguist (innovative) and accepting that a truly great imaginative mind wrote this book, I found _The Lord of the Rings_ to be a turgid trudge of a read. Thoroughly and utterly disappointing.It's interesting for the first 700 pages. Thereafter I couldn't wait for it to finally end.I completely lost interest in _The Return of the King_ -- the first two books of the trilogy were moderately interesting.A good cure for insomnia, makes a very good door-stop. I hope the movie is better than the book."
5,The Lord of the Rings (50th Anniversary Edition),"The quality appears to be excellent and it arrived in pristine condition. ""Precious"" shiny golden gilded pages with a nice ribbon place marker in an elegant and high quality slipcase. I am very pleased with the quality of this edition and expect it to take the number one spot in my Tolkien collection."
5,Epic trilogy!,"The Lord of the Rings is an epic trilogy (and I try to not use the word ""epic"" lightly). It is well worth reading. There isn't a whole lot to say about it other than READ IT! I know there have been some complaints about different editions, so if you are concerned about the look and feel of the book, the binding, and whether it has maps or glossaries or anything like that, I recommend looking at it in a book store so you can pick your edition, then buying on Amazon. Looking at it in the book store first will help you know what you're getting, but you're almost sure to get a better deal on Amazon. It never hurts to price compare though. If you don't care about which edition and only care about the story itself, buy it and read it! It's an epic journey everyone should take. Yes, I'm aware I said ""epic"" more than once, haha. This trilogy deserves it :)"
2,Poor edition,The edition is poor for a title like this. Another problem is that the book I received was in poor condition. The spine is beaten and the last pages are dirty. I hope a good edition but I received a poor edition.
1,The Lord of the Rings is much better than expected.,"After reading the first 2 books of this 3 book series, I was not prepared for such a fitting ending with this 3rd book. Frodo is such a likeable fellow, and Sam a loyal companion. The trials these Hobbits go through are incredible. I almost thought Frodo would never see the Shire or Hobbiton again. A must read."
3,Not the Best,"Sure this book is good, but the first book is too long and the last was too short story wise. My advice : read The Eye of The World, the first book in the BEST fantasy series ever, The Wheel of Time. Sure it's supposed to be 12 books long, but it will be worth it."
5,Looking for the best copy of LOTR and THE HOBBIT?,"What makes these specific editions exciting are the wonderfully detailed paintings and pencil drawings by Alan Lee. They are beyond compare to any book I have read with illustrations. He is able to capture the fantasy magnificently. It is not always the heat of the action he depicts. Often it is simple scenery which brings the reader to the place itself, picturing it in her or his own mind so well, s/he can feel the very breeze as it swirls right out of the page!"
4,One Ring to Rule Them All...,"This book, although sometimes dull and full of details, is a chilling tale and worth reading. If you read this book, you will surely want to read the other two in the trilogy, so make time to. I would compare the genius of the novel to that of the Harry Potter series or The Chronicles of Narnia."
2,Slurpy print,"No illustrations in this edition, but it is the print which is blurry throughout the LOTR trilogy. I returned them."
4,Pretty Good Edition,"I would love to have a leather bound edition for my library. Something similar to Borders or Barnes and Noble leather series in terms of quality and cost. Unfortunately, this edition will have to do. I would prefer to see heavier weight paper and much larger font...but that would likely push it to two volumes. Unless you want to spend a couple hundred for the Easton Press editions, this is the nicest you will find for your library."
5,Finally -- Back to where it all started,"This is the One, true fantasy that started it all. I wish that all the great books like this one would be available on Kindle. The Lord of the Rings is timeless and is the prototype and originator of the Fantasy Genre. Read it, you will not be disapointed.Thank you Amazon and Tolkien family for making this available. I would have bought this at any price."
5,Almost there...,"Most of the people who are going to buy this book are LOTR fanatics and collectors Is the book good value or is it collectable. Well...Yes. It is probably the nicest single volume set of The Lord of the Rings I have come across and that includes the India paper single volumes.The package is complete with embossed gilt eye and rings of Sauron, full leather gold gilt page block, silk page marker. Full maps. section sewn.The text font is very clear and legible unlike many other editions and you could use this book to read the whole saga. Though my personal preference is the Allen and Unwin editions particularly the 2nd edition.Very nice presentation and considering you would pay almost the same price for the ""ordinary"" hardcover volume represents good value. Consider how much you pay for the folio society set.Still I await the ultimate three volume set....maybe the 100th Anniversary edition."
3,LOTR for the Kindle: Disappointing,"This isn't a review of the book, it's a review of the Kindle version. First, from a quality perspective, the Kindle's version is lacking. I don't how hard it is to move from a printed book to a digital version but there were many misspellings and typographical errors in the Kindle version. This can be improved upon. But from a hardware perspective, the Kindle shows its limitations. In the book there are hyper-links from certain terms that the characters use to their definitions in the appendix. This is a great idea! Unfortunately it takes forever to use the joystick controller to select the hyperlink. This is a limitation of the Kindle software. Another limitation is the ability to look at the maps in the book. You can't zoom in! :( It's too bad that an electronic version would not have better features that a book doesn't have. I may end up buying the books instead."
3,A over-rated edition,"There was much hype about this special edition of one of the world's most loved books' arrival. However, I found it to be somewhat disappointing. The binding and slip cover are very nice, but the pages are akin to an old family bible - thin and flimsy, nearly transparent. There are a few generic graphical decorations, but no illustrations. The maps in the back are of low-quality and flimsy - mine actually ripped just by opening it despite the extreme care I was taking. Overall, I much prefer the red-bound Collector's Edition or the one illustrated by Alan Lee. This one was *not* worth the money!"
2,NOT SO GREAT,"Does anyone share my opinion that, at times, Tolkienm can be so boring, with his endless descriptions of trees, nature, rivers, mountains, west, east, sun, moon, blá, blá, blá...? By the way, I hate the hobbits!"
2,LOTR Book set,"When I first opened the shipment I noticed that the corner of the book set was a little crushed- possibly from poor ""handling"" at the warehouse. After opening the shrink-wrap from the book set I noticed that the entire back side of the case was cut- making it a ""door"" instead of a solid back... not sure how that happened. I sent it back to Amazon who switched it with a different book set. However- the new book set arrived with a crushed corner. So much for ""shipping and handling""..."
1,BORED of the Rings,Its about as exciting as reading the dictionary and just as long. Tolkien was one messed up dude. ITs more like descriptions of places and things more than an actual story. I'd rather read the back of a bottle of shampoo.
2,Boring.......,"Tired of all the hullaballoo surrounding Tolkien I finally purchased LOtR. I enjoy fantasy and tried to give it a fair shake but put the book down from boredom a quarter of the way through. I found myself rereading pages because my mind wasn't getting into his prose. There are better works out there, IMHO.Everyone sings the praises of him so YOU might enjoy it, but I much prefer George Martin's series A Song of Ice and Fire."
3,It's The Quality Of The Book Again!,"LOTR is a whole century masterpiece! Tolkien's writing ismagnificient! No doubt about that! I'd say his genre is so much betterthan of Rowling's but who's to compare, right? It'll be like comparingdown to who's the better teen performers in the music business:Aguilera or Spears and we'd end up BOTH! I'd read the trilogy and wasso fascinated at the story and the genre Tolkien had created (like Isaid it was magnificient and may I say that again!) BUT then againit's the quite poor quality of this book: The Collector's Edition..."
2,errors in Kindle edition,"This is a review for the Kindle edition of this offering, not a review of Tolkien's work, which I've already read in print form (and would rate five stars for a quality edition). I cannot speak of the print edition also offered under this entry, since I haven't purchased it, but the Kindle edition is marred by numerous typographical errors. For example, I've seen more instances of misplaced quotation marks than I can count, and I've seen ""Éomer"" misspelled several times. These are just examples, but anyone who cringes at sloppiness in renderings of Tolkien's work will have a hard time with the sloppy editing of this Kindle version.If you just want to buy something that gives you all three volumes of the epic at once for your Kindle, and you can forgive the errors, you'll be perfectly happy, as far as I can tell."
5,Info Dork,"Best audio drama of the trilogy out there. (I also own the BBC's, which is nowhere near as good as The Mind's Eye's.)"
5,A Masterful Classic,One of the best books ever written presented in a way that will make it stand out on any bookshelf.
3,Picture does not match product,"Bought the book but was not as shown. Got a refund. Still wish product was the same as pictured, always very good books. Tolkien is a master."
5,A clasic,"As always this is a classic, a most read. Physically the book is a hig cuality product and it will enrich your collection"
1,"Great Story, Poor Quality Product","This book is a fantastic read, but if you're looking for a high-quality collector's edition to adorn your library this isn't it. The quality of the printing is very poor, sometimes very light and other times too dark. In my copy the map that is glued inside the back cover is slightly askew and sticks out beyond the edge cover. Not worth the money."
5,A must have,This audio book is far more than the reading of a Great Book. Mr Inglis gives us a reading that brings alive Middle Earth. You are transported to a world that is both beautiful and compelling. The singing of Mr Inglis is truly excellent and his reading of Tolkien's words brings out the beauty of the English language. A truly Must Have.
2,Get the right one,"While this is a very sincere effort at reducing LOTR into digestible audio episodes, it simply cannot compete with the BBC's version. It might be slightly more appropriate for younger listeners, and features more direct quoting from the novel's descriptive passages, but essentially every voice actor is inferior to the BBC counterpart, and the breaks every half hour (at least on the cassette version) leave the story feeling choppy. Look into this if you're a completist, but if you only want one, go with the BBC."
5,Magic.,I thoroughly enjoy the entire series. I've reread these books every year since I've been 15 years of age. A must read! A Must!
5,Tolkien's masterpiece,"A true marvel of imagination and fantasy. Tolkien sets the standard for all English fantasy writing in this series of novels and is a true classic by any standard. A true must read.I would offer a complaint for the Kindle edition. I use the kindle app on my ipod and it is difficult to find and navigate to the bookmarks. I highlighted a few passages, and the highlighted passages and bookmarks were combined in one section on the navigation page and it was difficult to find my bookmark. For ease of use and portability though, it is awesome!"
5,Great Product,"I bought this item expectating something different of any other The Lord of the Rings books ever made and my expectations came true, so I recommend this item for everyone who loves Tolkien works"
5,the dude,"Great books, great edition, and great illustrations by Alan Lee. The only thing I did't like was the maps don't fold out like in most other hardcover editions and are in the endpapers so down the middle of the map there is a crease."
4,"5 Star book, 4 star presentation","While it would be nice if the maps were in the book, and if more of the images had been included, this is a great book.The text has all of the corrections up to the most recent print editions, the story is great and these are books any fan of fantasy should read."
5,A fantasy story that touches your soul.,"The characters in this story have a way of coming to life. If you have a brain and an imagination and you want to do something special for it, then read the Tolkien tale Hobbit and Lord of the Rings. Your life will never be the same."
5,The Lord of the Books,This is one of the best series of books ever. It has a great description of everything that you can even imagine yourself in the setting. It's an amazing set that once you start you just can't stop.
5,Just read LotR for the Umpteenth time...,"Words can't express how good this book is. It really is a fantastic tale full of adventure, danger and emotion. The book should be included among some of the greatest English mythology. You HAVE to read this, it's sooo good. It tells the tale of Frodo the Hobbit and his quest to destroy the One Ring forged by Sauron in MiddleEarth, the end of the Third Age, the return of the King of Gondor and the remaking of Narsil, the sword of the heirs of Elendil and of the passing of the Elves over the Western Sea. An absolute must - already the downloads for the movie coming out in 2001 have surpassed those of Star Wars: Episode 1, and I for one can't wait for the movie to come out.................."
5,Best Book I've read,I love Lord of the Rings. I like how there is so many characters and it kinda relates to reality. I also like the adventures that the characters go through. The information that the book gives you let your imagination go. It the best book ever!
5,A must for any reader of any genre,"I've read the entire trilogy about 6 times now, and i'm only 17. everytime i read it, it only seems to get better, and i always find something new and interesting to futher captivate my mind. i still border on fits of anxiety when i read the dramatic climax of the story(i'll let you read it to find out what happens). i recommend this book very highly. shame on all who haven't read it!"
2,Poor Printing,"This book was purchased as Christmas gift for our children to be read by us to them. Having previously read this book myself I wanted to share Tolkiens world with them. The story is wonderful, the illustration excellent. However,and this is the reason for the rating, the print quality is very poor and some pages are blank. I am a bit taken back by it all considering the price of the book. If you are going to spend money on this wonderful trilogy I wouldn't spend it on this book."
5,One Ring to rule them all and in the darkness bind them.,"All three volumes in one book!Join Frodo on his quest to destroy the One Ring and protect the middle earth from the Dark Lord. Meet orcs, elves, dwarves, hobbits, the tortured Gollum, the wizard Gandalf, face the terrible ringwraiths; discover the lores and songs of ancient folks and lost lands. Become part of the legend!Altogether a wonderful book, with hours and hours of suspenseful pleasure. Tolkien's worlds are so complete and researched you would swear they actually existed. You'll find several appendices with maps, chronologies, family trees, calendars, pronunciation and writing guides... A classic and a gem!"
5,Is good.,"Quite simply, Lord of the Rings is the standard by which all other fantasy books should be compared to. It's enduring ability to capture the hearts and imaginations of new generations is proof of that."
2,Poor Quality,"The idea is awsome as others have noted. However for the cost of the book, I was disapointed with the flaws in the gold leaf. I returned it and got another somewhat beter copy."
1,I will not buy ANY edition of LOTR from Amazon!,"Hardcover, paperback, Kindle - you name it - I won't get it here. Why? Because it's difficult to figure out what kind of product you're getting since they lump reviews of different editions together. I've been an enthusiastic Amazon customer for years, but this just makes me angry.I'm going to make an old-fashioned trip to a number of old-fashioned bookstores and enjoy the process of hand-picking that special edition for myself. Devote a day to it. Because Tolkien is worth the effort."
1,Lord of The Rings - Audio version,"This audio version is TERRIBLE. The narrator sounds like a failed game show host. Frodo is flat, lifeless and reminds one of limp lettuce that has been in the fridge for too long. Very dissapointing after hearing the BBC version of ""The Hobbit"". This doesn't even come close to quality entertainment."
5,A bargain,"You know the story. I paid only $40 for this superb edition. It's printed on thick semi-glossy paper. The illustrations are excellent. Be sure to get the matching book of The Hobbit, of same quality."
5,The best piece of fiction there is,These books are absolutely fantastic. It just really doesn't get much better the The Lord of the Rings. I read these books every year and they never get old. Each time I pick them up I get as excited about reading them as I did on my very first time. These books are for all ages though probably better suited to high school age and above. They provide for an excellent insight in to Christian (more specifically Catholic) understanding. This would be a wonderful gift to get anyone. I've read this book many times and even when I receive a new copy as a present I'm always grateful due to the wear and tear I give to the books. You just can't go wrong with this purchase.
3,Doesn't compare with genuine epics,"Genuine epics or legends are based on allegory.This means saying one thing but meaning something else.Examples are the Epic of Gilgamesh, the Iliad and Odyssey of Homer, and the legends of King Arthur.I'm afraid Lord of the Rings is not in the same class as these.Genuine mythic epics operate on two levels: the physical events and the higher or spiritual meaning.Lord of the Rings operates simply on the physical level, with mundane messages.In this book there is no transcendent realm of spirit where the true meaning should lie.The epics mentioned are really about the journey of the soul, the vital aspect which is lacking in Lord of the Rings.Frodo's aim is simply to through the ring away, not gain something, such as the quest of the Grail.Lord of the Rings is no more than a good story, and it is well written.It should not be mistaken for a genuine mythic legend."
1,Where are the women?,"I read the book (only) twice at the age of 11 and 14, and thought it was the best book ever. But as I don't any longer think of ""Bluesbrothers"" as the best movie ever I must admit that even in the LoR there are simply too many things missing: 1) Where are the women? I have a little daughter (4month) and I will not give her the book, because all the heroes are male (see deserves more than beeing a princess) 2) Where is the loss of important people? Dead of people we love is an important part of our lifes. In the LoR all heroes survife: its a fairy tale nothing more. (As Tolkine says, too. 3) Where are the problems between the main charaters? Look at Star Trek TNG: The first episodes are terrible boring, because ""we all love eachother"" - Star Trek DS9, which had no such restrictions, is much better - right from the beginning.So it is truely a very good book, but only with respect to a very limmited part of human life."
2,"Experimental, psychoanalytical 20. century novel","There is something strange about this ring business. If the ring is so darned powerful, why did Sauron lose it when he had it? And how come he seems so powerful now that he don't have it?The answer must be that the ring isn't magical at all. Rather, it is an object of obsession for the poor Sauron lad. Surely he had an unhappy, traumatic childhood, and the ring has come to represent loss and repressed sexuality. There is a streak of the pervert in Sauron, that old peeping tom in his tellingly shaped tower. (tower and ring: the symbolism isn't exactly subtle.)Obviously, the entire novel is written from his point of view, and describes his pathological visions of grandeur, of finally ""getting the ring"" (as I said, not exactly subtle.) All in all, it is an interesting literary experiment, but it goes on for way too many pages and becomes quite boring in the end."
5,Superb recording!,"I have to confess that I have not finished listening to the 55 hours' worth of listening in this audiobook. Neither am I a LOTR geek that has read the book eight times ;), but I am an avid fan of Tolkien's prose and of Peter Jackson's movies. When I started reading the actual book I was daunted by the sheer size and bored by the unsingable songs found rather constantly throughout the book. After some 300 pages I left the book stored in some dark corner of my collection, never to take it out again.Now, three years (and three amazing movies) later, I bought this recording and have been listening to it compulsively for the last three weeks. I have been utterly thrown off my car seat (hehehe) several times by Rob Inglis's beatufiul rendering of the different characters--I have not confused characters once thanks to Inglis's amazingly versatile voice.Anyway, it's a must buy for those that spend too much time in a car like me or any other prospective reader of LOTR."
2,Lots of misprints in the Kindle edition,"I will not spend words on Tolkien's work itself, which does not need the likes of me to defend it. Lord of the Rings is a five-star book.However, I'm giving the Kindle edition two stars since it is riddled with misprints that ruin the experience, especially for new readers who cannot be expected to fill in the missing letters or words from context and memory. The accented E (as in Éomer) seems to be particularly prone to induce typos, with numerous instances of Rohirric names misspelled. Words are half-gone or entirely missing sometimes. To add insult to injury, the preface of the book waxes poetic about how creation of an electronic version of the text has gone a long way into reducing mistakes.The only people who should buy the Kindle edition are experienced LOTR readers who desperately want a searchable version of the text. Everyone else, stick to paper!"
3,"Great books, but bad printing.","The Lord of the Rings books are great, but the publisher of these books really did a poor job of printing these. There is extra ink on some of the pages and the maps are poorly put in place."
5,"Beautiful, moving illustrations",The illustrations are breath-taking! I cannot wait until my children are old enough to experience the story first-hand with this book.
5,Beautiful Edition,"I bought this edition online at Barnes and Noble. The prices are better here, so by all means buy it from Amazon. I cannot even comment on how the book is so great. I will talk about the actual edition - IT IS BEAUTIFUL - when it arrived I was so overjoyed I screamed. It's my prized possesion!! It comes in a matching red case, and easily slides in and out. Designs similar to that of the Door to Moria made by Durin decorate the cover. Something I really like is the ink. There is both red and black ink, and it is clear and beautiful. Buy this as a gift for a Tolkien fan, or a mild enthusiest. I recommend the owner be at least 12.WOW!!"
5,A True Masterpiece of Fiction and Fantasy,"The Lord of the Rings is one of the greatest and perhaps most imitated works of fiction ever written. From the very begining the reader is drawn into a world of fantasy that compleatly surrounds. Tolkien brings the characters of Middle Earth to life in such detail and color that they seem as real as any name from history. As remarkable in it's rich detail and description as it is in it's plot, The Lord of the Rings is a must read for any fan of adventure or fantasy. My best advice is to spend the money to obtain a copy of the best quality that will last for a very long time, as this is a book that should be passed on from generation to generation."
2,Fairly disappointing...,"Overall, I'd say this is a fair audio adaptation of the trilogy. However, there are times when the action portrayed isn't adequately conveyed by what you are hearing. Also, as another reviewer noted, the voices given to the characters are terrible at times. For instance, they give Sam an annoying little boy's voice, and in one scene, for some reason, they give elves screechy fairy-folk voices, like they're supposed to be pixies or something. Did they just misunderstand what elves are supposed to be in the Tolkein mythology? Also, after seeing the movie, you will be disappointed when Gimli doesn't have a Scottish accent, and in general disappointed by the other voices. Another problem is that you get cheesy sounding laser blast sound effects when Gandalf uses his power. These things kind of ruined it for me."
3,Hire Jim Dale Next Time,"This seems to be the only unabridged recording on CD which is enough of a surprise. Unfortunately, I find the recording only average. Mr. Inglis does an alright job and I concede that this is a very difficult piece to handle, but I agree with the 12/11/2003 reviewer who said that he sounds bored at times, too sing-song at others. I would add to that that he doesn't do a good enough job of adopting well-distinguished voices for each character. If you have had the pleasure of hearing any of the Harry Potter books performed by Jim Dale, you will be disappointed, as I was, by this one. Nevertheless, for now, this is the only way to listen to the pure, unedited Tolkien.Also, I just discovered, my copy of FotR has two disc 16's and no disc 15!!! Tried playing each to see if it was just a labelling problem - they are the same disc."
1,Cover picture does not match actual book.,It seems Harper Collins has two different books in their catalog with the ISBN of 0261103253. One is the 1995 copywrite revised text edition paperback (which is the book you will actually get if you order it.) The other is the 50th Anniversary edition paperback (which is the cover picture shown here.) So buyer beware.
2,"Good idea, bad delivery: Red Leatherette Edition","I bought this book new from Barnes and Noble a few days ago (over-priced). Upon opening the shrink-wrap I discovered several flaws with the quality of the book.1. The back-top corner was bent in, leaving a tear in the leatherette covering.2. SEVERAL pages were bent in at the corners (and since the paper is so thin, it stays bent)3. Two pages had large creases in them, running through the text.4. A few pages were uneven, cut too short.5. The cover looks nice, but feels cheap.Other than that, it's still wonderful Tolkien, but I don't recommend this edition."
5,One of the two best Trilogies! Ever!!,"IMHO, this trilogy stands out beyond all others because of its wonderful imagery, characters and gripping story. The fact that many of the themes underlying the story relate so well to real life makes the story more personal and individual. No matter how many different people read this series each has their own special take on it. This is a absolute must own for all discerning readers."
5,Tolkien: The lord of the Rings,"These books are incredibly good! I have read a couple of other fanatsy books that i thought was kewl but after these books they aren't half as good as they were! Buy it, you won't regret it."
5,The greatest fantasy book I've ever read!,"If you like fantasy and you have'nt read this book, then you must be dead!This is the one that started it all!Buy it! Read it! Love it!The absolute all time classic!!!!!!!"
5,feel it! live it! after all read it!,"That's not only a novel.If you read it you find a life which was has Frodo,Gandalf,Aragorn...Take your lifes in it.Save the Ring forever."
5,Best fantasy book ever !,"This is the best fantasy book I have ever read. The Lord of the Rings contains everything a good fantasy book should contain, and then some more. It's undoubtedly worth reading !"
5,Do business with these guys.,I didn't get the product I paid for but they were very professional about refunding my money. I sent an e-mail seeking clarification and they responded the same day. I will do business with them again.
5,Fantastic edition,"This edition of LOTR is fantastic. Lot's of beautiful illustrations, and the appendices really help to provide a fuller picture of the story. Highly recommend."
5,The best story ever written.,"I first read this book when I was thirteen years old. I have read thousands of books and nothing can come close to this story. I've read it over forty times. Of all the books I have read, if I could choose one book, this would be it! Give yourself a vacation and go to Middle Earth."
5,more than a book,"it's just the greatest imagination book i've ever read... that's fantastic, fabulous & amazing... just read it... offer it to your closest friends, to your kids... that's the book .. a must have ...;"
3,Wordy...,"I just thought that this trilogy overly comsumed by words. it was a novel that could have been about three-hundred pages shorter in retrospect. I finished the book, out of determation and interest in it, but found that At times I didn't think I'd ever get through it... the movies were the big thing that made interested me enough to finally reading it. Outside of four years of three of my best friends Raving almost daily, over their love of this book. Although I do get into Fanasy, I just like more the ainti-hero Novels more. All in all, it was a good book, wordy yes, but I can't take anything away from it's statius as a classic."
4,great book,"this book is awsome.when you first look at it you get a little bit scared ,because it's very big (about 1000 pages)and the first pages are really boring,but when u really start to read it,you just can'tstop,its very exciting,it makes you very curious to know what's going to happen next and it gets you inside the book,taking you to a different world.the characters complement themselves just perfectely and it's very well written (way better than ''harry potter'')and if you watched the movie and liked it,you are going to love the book"
5,Great Series,"I am 14, soon 15. I read the Hobbit in fifth grade , and the Lord of the Rings in sixth. These books are literary masterpieces. Tolkien gives his characters great depth and you feel as if each one is an actual person. I can say the same for the detailed geography Tolkien produced for his world of Middle Earth. The story is enthralling and you will remember it for the rest of your life. I also read the Silmarillion. It is slow to take off, but when it does it blows you away with the tales of battles, sad romance, and treachery. Forgive me for my repitition, but I must say again that these books are wonderful and timeless."
3,ponderous but quite interesting fantasy,"Best book of the last Thousand Years! Who are these people? O tempora, O mores."
2,Dissapointing,60 pages in and I have already found a number of obvious typos. Dissapointing to say the least. Hopefully HC will re-release this with errors fixed.
5,Amazing,"I've adored LOTR's for years. I like the books better than the movies. The books are pure and the poetry in the entire book collection is amazing. It reminded me of a book I own called Echoes of Whimsy. I'm a sucker for the elven songs found throughout Tolkien's epic writing. there are others too, like when Treebeard sings and many other characters do this. To me it's all very poetic and the same as the beautiful verses found in <a href=""http://emergingpoets.com/EOW.htm"">Echoes of Whimsy</a>. Yes, I'm raving over this new one too, I just bought it and I adore anything that is like LOTR's with wizards, elves, magic, fantasy. It's all good. I would recomend Tolkien to anyone who wants a perfect read and to be drug into a world filled with interesting characters which come to life through the pages in this epic novel. Bravo!"
2,caveat emptor,"Undoubtably one of the best works of literature ever written and on its own merits deserves 10 stars.That said, the praise from earlier purchasers/reviewers (2004, etc) of the leather binding no longer applies, as this is not bound in leather any longer. It looks really close, but it is a thin paper imitation now. I bought this book for my son for Christmas, and when it arrived it was shrink wrapped. I did not want to remove this wrapping before Christmas; now I wish I had, because it is too late to return it and ask for a leather volume as advertised. Too bad - does not speak well of the integrity of the publishers....By all means order this and enjoy it for the extraordinary tale, but do not expect that you are getting real leather for the price tag."
3,okay,"I'm a HUGE Tolkein fan. This CD way OKAY, here's why.Up's,-differnt voices so you know who's talking-labeld CD's so you don't have to go looking for a part you want to listen to-a little bit of music so it keeps you awakeDown's,-voices don't seem to fit characters, it would be better if one person did all the voices such as Jim Dale-it's abridged-the manner in which they abridge it makes the battle of Minus Tirith seem minor-some words like Minus Tirith pronounced as ni-nus Tirith istead of Me-nus tirith"
5,A classic reading for everyone. A fantastic jouney to Middle Earth.,"The Lord of the rings feeds the readers imaginationTakes the reader on a roller coaster ride with imagination, adventure and excitement. Best read ""The Hobbit"" first to appreciate all of JRR Toiken's characters. My children and grandchildren live a richer fuller life, having digested both The Hobbit and the three volumes of these novels. J H Trembley"
4,pants,nice pants as expected. great fit and quality. Use these for work and are quite durable. Will definitely purchase again
2,Cheap,"Wish I had just shopped at a book store for this one. Supposed to be new, but pages are folded and there are marks and writing along the bottom. Plus, the quality of the book as a whole just feels cheap. Very disappointed."
5,Just... Beautiful,"This edition is perfect, the sleeve is very pretty and shiny, and the hardcovers are a beautiful blue. The pages are made from the nicest paper I've ever touched, it's a bit like photo paper but softer."
5,One of the best books ever written,"I know I am a raving fan, but rereading this today, left me the impression that JRR was a genius. You will enjoy how whimsical and scary this book can be, all in the same sentence."
2,about this particular edition,"(I am not a native speaker, please overlook my style)I am not going to review the novel, the root and basis of modern fantasy, a novel I simply love, even if I am not entirely blind to some of its flaws.This edition was quite a disappointment to me: I bought it to have a nice collectible edition of this classic and was sadly disappointed: the box and the over bookcover are lovely, the pictures are exquisite but the binding is very poor in quality; poor as it is, it is still better than the paper used and the printing which are untolerable for an edition as expensive as this.If you are looking for an edition for your library, chose elsewhere."
5,Happy I spent a little more for this volume,"The quality of this book is second to none. From the leather cover, the fine paper, the bookmark; all made for an unforgettable reading experience. Superb!"
3,Economical but a bit hard to read,The book is really inexpensive yet i prefer the 3 book edition coz the word size is bigger and line more spaced. So if not in a tight budget i advise those first time reader get the 3-set edition
5,classic,My advise to anyone who loves this book. Buy a paperback edition you can drag around with you wherever you go. This isn't a book you read in a day or two. (unless you read a lot faster than humanly possible)
5,"Amazing book, best fantasy book ever","This book is truly the best piece of fantasy ever written. The plot is rich, heavy and vibrant, full of subtalities and esoteric undercurrents. The characters feel as if they were flesh and blood, and not just ink and paper. They experience internal and external anguish, fear, doubt and sorrow. In esence, they appear to be actually living, not just existing for the transient amusement of the reader, only to be extinguished as the pages are closed. Every thing is placed in a living, coharant, world, which Tolkien took great pains to construct and populate. Overall, this book is required reading for anyone even remotly intrested in literature, and fantasy."
5,The Lord of the Rings defines fantasy.,Tolkein is the epitomy of fantasy. Anybody who reads fantasy has to read this book. To say that you are a fan of fantasy is a hypocrisy if you haven't. I read it when I was 13 and then twice more later on in my teenage years and I keep finding things that I missed the first times. There are no fantasy books out there that could even be put in the same category as The Lord of the Rings!
5,One of the best stories of our time!,"What can I say about this classic, epic story? Tolkien has done something that is very rare. He has created another world, complete with languages and history and he has done it masterfully."
3,Bored of the Rings,"Good story, interesting plot -- though it is hampered by a need to have read _The Hobbit_ if you are to understand all of the context.Book 1 moved along swiftly.Book 2 started to bog down.Book 3 got stuck in the mud. So I concentrated, and worked really hard, and still got bogged down. So I put the book down for a while, and tried again. Still got bogged down.Eventually, I got to the point where I didn't really care what happened to the darn Hobbits, I just wanted the story to end.The movie is better than the book, or so I'm told."
2,Love the content. Hate the presentation,- quality of the printing...excellent- quality of the binding...good- usefulness for actual reading...poor. It's too heavy for that.- usefulness for collectors...none. This edition has been in print on and off for over 20 years.- Fold out map...good in a pinch. Not a substitute for Fonstad's Atlas of Middle Earth.- content...priceless
2,Too hard to get into,I got this for my 14 yr old who is an avid reader. He didn't like it at all and I returned it through kindle. I am pleased they took the return because I got this and The Lord of the Rings so it would have been a waste of money!
4,Good book.,The book arrived in good condition. The gold leafing is a bit uneven and the maps are hard to open without ripping. The book isn't very heavy and has a convenient bookmark. The pages are not as thin as some reviewers have said and the text is easy to read. Binding is a bit awkward. This is my first edition of Lord of the rings as one book and I thought it was a good copy.
4,Beautiful set,"I bought these for my 13 year old grandson for Christmas and he was thrilled. These books are large and heavy, but that's what he wanted and the illustrations are so beautiful. I visited several other websites and local bookstores before this purchase, but Amazon had the best price for this set. I am very pleased with this purchase."
5,Behold the Gold!,"This book is as well crafted as any dwarf would please,upon its golden pages like Lothlorien leaves,A map in the front for all your travels,An index in the back for uneducated rabbles,Profound in heart as the words will be,remember the message; drive on for peace."
5,One of my all-time favorites,"I first read the trilogy back in 1977 and I loved it then. I wasn't surewhat to think about the Peter Jackson movies because I couldn'timagine anyone actually doing them with real actors. I thought hedid a great job, but I was happy I'd read the books before I saw themovies. If you've seen the movies and haven't read the books, youdefinitely need to. One of the best fantasy novels EVER!"
5,A must read for anyone who likes fantasy,"The Lord of the Rings has been capturing the imagination of people for over fifty years. The reason for this is simple...it's an excellent book series. It's an adventure like no other, filled with heroes battling orcs, goblins, trolls, and other monsters. Among my other favorites are Abacar the Wizard and the Dark Elf Trilogy. All three book series are excellent."
1,Not what it appears to be,"The bargain hardcover ($29.99) has the identical cover as the illustrated hardcover ($44.10). It also has the same illustrations, but it is nothing more than a paperback wrapped in a hardcover binding. Worst of all are the maps, which are not foldout maps and are the same as the maps in the trade paperback! I have returned the copy I ordered. This is extremely deceptive on the part of both the publisher and Amazon."
5,Best thing ever,"This was the best thing I could get. The books are in very good quality, the letters are clear and the drawing is beautiful. I completely recomend this item."
5,WOW!,"This is amazing. I've been after a 'special' copy of this book for years now, but I've never been able to afford it. There are similar copies on sale in the UK but they've been exchanging hands for in between 100 and 400 pounds - the exchange rate on this one worked out as somewhere around 40 quid including postage and packaging, I call that a bargain! This is a truely beautiful edition of an enchanting story. I wouldn't reccomend you buy it to read and re-read, I've destroyed several paperback copies already with my avid thumbing, but if you're a real nutcase fan and you want a copy of the book which will last you forever, I'd suggest you buy this. I just like looking at it!"
5,One of the Best Books of All-Time,This is one of my top five books that I have read all-time. The books can be very confusing at first especially with all oof the similiar names but watching the movies first helps to put some faces with names and gives you a general outline and this book becomes much more easy to digest. I am having a hard time finding a book to follow-up with because seriously there is not much that comes close to this book. I particulary liked the 50th Anniversary Edition because I liked having all the three books in one hand and the appendixes that were included at the end.
4,Good Service-Great Book,"To review the book there is not much I can say, that has not already been said. This is a great addition to any library, it is in my opinion one of the greatest literary works of our time. If you are a fan of the Peter Jackson films then you definitively must read Tolkien's pages upon pages that burst alive with so much more detail and vibrancy than any film could possibly portray. And I say that as a rather big fan of the films. The complete volumes in short is a masterpiece.Seller was very gracious as well and I am a satisfied customer. Keep it up =)"
5,A must-read!,Jann Aldredge-Clanton delivers in this encompassing book. She is scholarly and inspiring at once and reawakened a spirituality based in the Christ figure that I'd lost in patriarchal christianity. Worth every cent and any wait in receiving!
5,Focus Pro is awesome...,"If you want the best digital non-programmable t-stat on the market, look no further. It's super easy to setup, easy to level, easy to mount and install batteries, and VERY easy to read. This is one great t-stat!"
1,Honeywell TH5110D1006 Focuspro 5000,On Amazon's page this product says it does 3 heat 2 cool it does not...it only does 1 heat one cool..save yourself the trouble of having to return it if you have a heat pump with aux heat...
2,Too dim,Bought this for my 87 yr old mother because she could not read the old one.I thought the display would be much brighter looking at the picture but it is not much better then her old one and the numbers are not that big.Manufactures need to start supplying better products for the elderly.
5,"so far, so good!",I had a Peerless residential boiler installed 5 years ago.A robert shaw themostat was used.The boiler would not start reliably using the robert shaw thermostat. The plumbers made at least 5 visits to our place.A plumber from out of town recommendedthis specific honeywell focus pro non programmable thermostat.He had seen problems in his multiple experiences with a poorconnection of the thermostat to the boiler. Probably other problemswith this too.We had the original company come back and hook up the honeywelland the boiler is starting up right away as needed.This is a relief and is much appreciated to have a reliable systemoperating thus far!Thank you!
3,Must be properly calibrated before installation,"This thermostat works well. I have two of them in my home. The first thermostat I bought was installed by a professional. After watching him, I thought it was pretty simple and straight forward so I decided to install the second one myself. That is when all the problems started. I blew a fuse in our air handler because the thermostat was not calibrated for heating and cooling. I did not know that it had to be calibrated and the literature that came with this item did not address that. I called Honeywell and they were very helpful in talking me through the process. I strongly suggest you call the hot line first before attempting to install yourself."
3,Not as pictured,I just got mine and I have to agree with the guy who left a one star review ... the display is smaller than the one pictured. The display is the same size as this thermostat:Honeywell RTH5100B 1025 Deluxe Manual Thermostat
1,CRAP ! POOR DISPLAY ! Not as pictured !!,"The displayed image in distorted and misleading the LCD window is actually considerably smaller about 1.25 inches square and is very poorly lit nothing at all like the pictured unit which must be Photoshoped .I purchased this for my 80 year old mother thinking the display was easy to read and would be well lit, what a disappointment, Truly disappointed ! I will not buy another HONEYWELL , the next unit and a different brand will not be purchased sight unseen for fear of the same scam so beware. I guess I am off to the local home improvement store to purchase a different brand . VERY UNHAPPY ..NO ! I WONT SEND IT BACK I 'll JUST TOSS IT AND BE MORE CAREFUL in choosing the next one NOT HONEYWELL !"
3,*** Not That Great ***,"We've been fans of Corelle products, been using them for years, and they live up to our expectations. These are light, easy to clean, durable, and nicely designed, with a relatively wide selection of patterns to choose from (I also use them in the microwave and toaster oven to warm up leftover). It is my first choice for the day to day usage.We got two of these Bowls (actually it's more of a not too deep dish) to use with the dinner set, it is smaller than expected, OK for salad/soup, and may be for serving a small casserole."
4,apricot grove bowls,I love them and the fact that they are corelle made it even better. They really take a lot of abuse and never break.
1,Don't bother. Its mostly drivel,"Hey. Don't be fooled by all the positive reviews. This isn't really a book about bowel problems. Its about anecdotal, unsupported, stories about some people who might have improved anyway. No science. No pretense of science. Not much information. Just look at how many used copies are for sale. Save your money. Stop going to MacDonalds, go home and cook yourself a good meal. Get a cookbook. Learn to cook. Don't buy this book. Drivel"
5,Healthy Digestion the Natural Way,This book clearly explained and identified sooo many misconceptions I had about the digestive system. I was thrilled with the information I gained and have already put into practice new ways to deal with my personal digestive problems. The results of this change to a natural way (no drugs) has improved my well being a 100 fold. Thanks to the author for writing this book and for the recommendation of this book in a local paper.
5,Digestible digestion book,Here finally manifested the long hoped for authoritative direction in the jungle of indigestible digestion books! If you really want to find out about solutions to your digestive problems - this is where you find them in a way that we all can understand and put into practice. What is needed now are good translations into European and other languages so that people all over the world can benefit from this great treasure that Dr. Berkson has offered all of us. Continue your great work and we all look forward to many more such immensely useful books!
1,Overrated!,"I had older 500 thread count sheets that were better, lighter, smoother. These feel like 200 thread count sheets. Complete waste of money."
1,horrible,These are the roughest sheets I have ever purchased. 1000 thread? more like 10!I returned them after trying to get them to soften up in the wash and they had to be ironed.
5,For the diehard Zildjian fan,"Very few gifts you can give a drummer (or keep for yourself) have as strong a relationship to the product as this one. What better expression of what drummers do than a clock? A time keeper for the time keeper!What is remarkable is the clock is a genuine Zildjian cymbal - not a good one, mind you, but one just the same. I couldn't resist lightly striking it with a stick, only to be rewarded with an aweful clang.As a cymbal it leaves a lot to be desired, but it wasn't designed to be one. It is one of the most unique conversation pieces though, and hangs in my practice room. I only wish there was a K model clock so I could really show my loyalty. Also check out the Zildjian mouse pad (ASIN B0002F5GVG) that looks just like an 8"" A-series splash cymbal!"
5,My drummer boy loved it!,"Perfect for his man cave! As a drummer he is pretty picky on what he wants displayed in his part of the house. I was worried on this one, but it was his favorite Christmas present. Good quality. Just have to be careful of the exposed time needles."
5,SHIPPING DATE--TOO LONG!,"I purchased this CD on 6/27/10 and did not receive it until the very end of July or beginning of August. Buyer said there was some problems with the orders placed from amazon.com. Loved the CD and it was hard to find the song I loved. I will say if I can't find the music I'm looking for locally, I almost always find it on amazon."
3,BK Stand Up!,"This album is okay, but the track "" Danger"" is red hot. Any true Hip Hop head should have this in their library. BK stand Up!!!"
3,No Mouse in the House!,"""There's a Mouse in the House"" was incomplete ......was actually missing the ""Mouse"" that was supposed to come with the book...so, ""There was NO mouse in the House! Book was in very good condition though"
5,18month old Loves it!,I had this book as a child and recently purchased it for my 18 month old daughter. She loves to read books and this is her new favorite. I will be purchasingTed and Dolly's Magic Carpet Ride (Slot Book)soon too.
5,fun!,My son loved this book so much and I didn't mind reading it over and over....the first one hundred times! You will be asked to read this book more than once. IT is such a cute story action book.
5,Happy buyer,I was very pleased with the product that I bought. I got it at about a quarter of the price and it came quickly. Very happy
4,Exactly as expected!,"I purchased this item directly from amazon.com (not from a third party seller on Amazon) and it arrived perfectly! The fragrance was brand new, still in its box, and smelled just like the tester at my local Ulta (so no knock-off for sure!). I was one of the apprehensive buyers, expecting the item to be inauthentic, but to my relief, this item was 100% original and new and at a much cheaper price! I agree with other reviewers about the short lasting power of this fragrance, but the same happens with the other Clean fragrances that I have (Warm Cotton and Shower Fresh). Clean fragrances usually do not last that long despite EDP strength. I will be buying from amazon.com in the future now that I know their products are new and authentic."
3,Great scent but...,"Although this is an eau de parfum, it does not last! Not at all.I LOVE the scent, and it is unfortunate that the smell doesn't last more than 30 minutes. Very disappointing."
4,Great deal,Can't beat this price for such a great smelling product. CLEAN is a great brand but overpriced at some stores.
5,Funky Africa,"A great window into the effects of American funk as it rippled across the African Continent. Hard to sit still as you listen to it...grooves are long, simple and sweaty. All the bands exhibit an equality of talent rare in compilations. This is a must for every party/wedding/road trip. Hopefully this will continue to deepen American's appreciation of the roots of modern West African popular music."
1,PROBLEM,AFTER YOU BUY THIS SOFTWARE YOU ARE THEN REQUIRED TO PAY EXTRA TO USE IT. THE OTHER SIMILAR SOFTWARE HAS THE SAME PROBLEM.
2,DISAPPOINTING,THE SMALL FORMAT AND TYPE SIZE MADE IT DIFFICULT TO READ. THE ILLUSTRATIONS ARE ALL ONE DIMENSIONAL SIDE VIEWS AND NOT VERY INTERESTING.ALL IN ALL A BOOK I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND.
2,Not What It Used to Be...,"I used this string years ago (2002ish) when I was playing in high school and absolutely loved it back then. It was extruded (formed) in such a way that it had what could be called a series of cuts going lengthwise with the string in what could be seen as almost a star shape if you looked at the end of it. This string of the past could spin a ball to insane levels and would often rip the majority of the fuzz off of one after a set or two. Now a days, their Spiky Shark is the string most similar to the old Super Smash Spiky but it's subdued a bit. This new Super Smash Spiky just has a series of what appear to be almost randomly spaced very (I emphasize very) shallow cuts across the string here and there. All in all I found it did nothing desirable for spin and played like your basic poly. So skip this and get Spiky Shark instead if you're looking for a good spin string."
5,Really love the characters in these movies. Family and friends have watched them with us and they all have their favorites. Only,"Really love the characters in these movies. Family and friends have watched them with us and they all have their favorites. Only one regret after watching these movies. We want more Where are the sequels? A question we are all asking? We guess it is a bit late to be asking this considering the movies were made in 1998 Maggie was a great character Loved Nick Did they ever find the truth about the baby? Did Mrs. ? the Polish, Jewish women really get executed?? The world may never know."
3,Get what you pay for.,This is a fine helmet. I'm in Las Vegas and ride a scooter so the over the ears design isn't the best choice for summer riding. But you can be sure its appreciated and used in the winter!
2,"kinda boring, actually","I think the cover is somewhat misleading: this is not what I thought it was.WHAT I THOUGHT IT WAS: a survey of famous ship wrecks that occurred in the Mediterranean. The story behind them, how they sank, what was in them, and recent attempts to recover their booty.WHAT IT TURNED OUT TO BE: It's basically about one shipwreck, an old Phoenician trader that sank about the time Homer was writing. At first they're not sure how old it is, but they send down a sub and Lord! Turns out it's old.Interesting as far as it went, but the high-tech geekiness was definitely at odds with the romantic, piratey mood conveyed by the cover."
3,"Okay, but not great","I was required to use the 13th edition for class in college. I bought the 10th edition. They match word-for-word, no difference whatsoever. The book itself is just okay. It explains the concepts quite decently."
4,"Good content, well explained.",I think this is a really good book for the economic evaluation of projects. It is well explained and doesn't go into unnecessary detail.
5,"A blessed reader from Apex, North Carolina -8/99","I think Jorie Kincaid did an outstanding job of letting you know just what was on her heart and just what kind of life these children have. Before I started reading this book, our desire to adopt was pure selfishness, we wanted a little girl. After I got done reading this book, our perspective changed. We wanted to help save a childs life. All of us in the U.S. have no idea what it is like to be without, but the children over in other countries do. We need to be a more thankful people because God has blessed us with so much. Next time you are contemplating over adopting, just think ""you are saving a childs life"". God will surely bless you for your decision."

5,"""It's not what you fling; it's the fling itself""","Beautiful quote from Chris-in-the-morning. This episode is considered the best by most of the actors. (stated in ""The NX Book"") As it is also a very popular episode with us fans. In it, Chris introduces `The fling`, and Maggie's mom visits...and...burns down her house......A must see for any NX new-comers! END"
3,good muzzle but design has changed,"This is actually an excellent quality muzzle but I had to give it 3 stars because the design has been changed. For many years I've used these muzzles for amateur whippet racing. The new design has a small change to the bottom holder of the chinstrap. It used to go straight back, now it turns downward, making the strap too loose on the narrow whippet head, and they can fall off easily."
2,Basket Muzzle Needed a better description,"This Muzzle, needed a much better description. I would have like to know that it was made out of plastic and only the strap was leather. It did hold up on my fmeale pit bull, and she was able to get out of it all the time. Also it didnt quite fit her right, she was not capable of eating thru the basket or drinking. And what is that little removable peice for in the front. When I removed it, there was little plastic peices sticking into her mouth and rubbing leaving marks. Not a well built muzzle."
5,marbles,Great Marble book. Informative with detailed photos. This book is for collectors old and new.
2,Not what I had in Mind,"When I ordered this book I was looking for an answer to my six-year-old question ""where do babies come from?"" From the title I thought this book would help with the uncomfortable topic of sex at a six-year-old level. The only thing this book did was preach about morals and values which I mostly agree with but are not completely true to this day and age with combined families and single parent families being more common. Plus I know how to teach morals and values I wanted something to explain the new baby in my tummy to my daughter. This book did not do that at all."
4,A Surprise Ending,The story loses some of its momentum because of the length and complexity of a car chase but the author does show enough skill to revive the suspense before the surprise ending. He also provides enough humor to keep the reader engaged.
3,GOOD BUT OUT DATED,THESE ARE VERY GOOD BUT THE ONES I GOT WERE 6 MONTHS OUT DATED. AMAZON MADE IT RIGHT. THANKS AMAZON
5,Fantastic!,"What a workout video! It's one of the best aerobic videos I own (and I have a few!) Being from the UK I had never heard of Kari Anderson but she is just great! The choreography is FUN FUN FUN and you want to see it through to the end. This video includes high impact for the advanced exerciser, and good music to keep you going! There is a warm up, 4 aerobic sections, a cool down, and stretch. This is one of the best workout videos around, I recommend you buy it!"
3,Puppets Vs. Gremlins,"I really didn't like the idea of the bad puppets going good in this one. I mean, would you want a movie where Michael Myers, Freddy Krueger, or Jason Voorhees turned good? It's a stupid idea, but this movie wasn't without some good style and a couple good death scenes that were courtesy of the ""gremlins"", not the puppets."
2,"I LOVE it, but it is not working:(","I bought this on Amazon on October 11, and here I am On December 1 online buying a replacement. I bought this to put on my 1 year old rescue to keep her from chewing me out of house and home. The only things this dog will not chew are the toys I buy for her, and trust me she has more toys then petsmart. I have tried everything. Bitter spray, raw hides, every brand and make of bone, toy, chew I can find. She has destroyed 2 remotes so far, and I caught her trying to eat my cell phone twice. This seemed like a perfect solution. Sadly she has broken the plastic in 2 places and is able to get her mouth out. She never wears it outside, so no trees, or concrete to use to smash or wear it down. I came home today to a torn open bag of dog food, torn apart baby wipes and I cannot find the tv remote..... I am switching to a metal model. She is not a big power breed or anything. She is a smallish flat coated retriever for pity sake."
3,Mediocre at best,"This type of muzzle is the best imo but the quality of this one is mediocre. The plastic had sharp edges which cut my dogs face. I trimmed the sharp edges with a knife and made them more rounded which works well, but I shouldn't have to do quality control, it should be done prior to shipment."
1,Did not fit,Following the recommendations of the seller did not save us from getting muzzles that were quite a bit too big.The thin leather straps do not appear to be very durable.I would recommend trying a muzzle on your dog for size to avoid a misfit.
3,muzzle,The strap did not have enough holes in it so the muzzle did not fit properly. I ended up having to punch more holes in the strap. Also my dog's fur gets tangled in the buckle part making it hard to see if the strap is properly buckled in.
5,The BIG Guide to Kit & Specialty Cars,"This book is amazing! The photographs alone make it worth the buy. Just look at the cover and get the sense of what this book has to offer. We keep this book on our coffee table and it is quite a conversation peice. Any book by Harold Pace, is factual and informative. I suggest buying his books if you want to learn about and/or enjoy cars."
5,Phillips Magnavox Universal Remote Control,"I bought this for a 1 year old who kept re-programming his parents' television and dvd players because he loved to play with the remote controls, so I have no idea how it functions as an actual remote because we did not put batteries in it for him to play with.But he loves it as a play remote! It also doubles as a drumstick sometimes....."
1,dead on delivery,This did not work out of the package and I returned it to Amazon for a refund. Have not received it yet. Bought one locally.
3,Worked most of my components,"This controlled my older TV and VCR, but would not work my newer Toshiba DVD writer D-RW2. I tried all the codes they suggested, then scanned thru all the codes a couple times before giving up. Otherwise, I like the feel and operation of the unit."
1,Constantly having to reprogram this remote,"This remote worked fine when I first received it. However, about three weeks later, it would not controll my dvd and vcr. I am constantly having to reprogram it, especially for the dvd. I'm very disappointed."
4,Love this remote!,"For this price, you can't really go wrong with anything.This remote works better than I thought and I like the button on it too. My son keeps on dropping it and banging the remote, so some of the buttons does not work anymore. Ordering my second one.Sometimes, it gets out of sync, but you only need to remember your tv mode. I am using it with the panasonic tv, and it works great!"
3,very helpful,"I am happy with this product.It does most of what I want it to do. Unfortunately, my new dvd player doesnt work with it. None of the codes for the new player seem to work.Also, for some reason, I have found that once in a while, the remote just doesnt work anymore and has to be reset. I am not sure what is causing this (faulty battery connection?) but overall, it does what I need it to do and it didnt cost me a fortune."
5,Great remote!!!,"Bought two of these remotes to program 2 T.V.s, 1 D.V.D. player, and 2 V.C.R.s!! First code worked on each elecronic. Probably the simplest remote I've had in a long, long time. I'd recommend it to anyone!!"
2,Philips Magnavox PM435S 4-Device Universal Remote Control,"Received the wrong remote, however it works with my TV, it isn't worth the trouble sending back."
1,Mine won't work/complete ldud,"I can only assume I got a dud because although the programming feature seems simple, it does not work either for the TV or VCR. I did get it to change the channel once and I read back the code with the instructed procedure which seemed like the righ tone for this model TV but it did not continue to change the channel or do anything. Of course I tried both reprogramming the code and autosearch again but no dice.There is only one code for my VCR but programming it in didn't work either nor did autoscan.I can only assume I got a complete dud, but I am very unhappy. Wasted my time and money(if I can find the store receipt I may return it, but then I'll have more time wasted)."
4,Can't complain,"I purchased this remote mainly for the picture in picture feature that I have not used for my tv since the original remote malfunctioned. Although the PIP works, it stays on the bottom left hand corner of the screen only. It would have been nice if I could shift it to all four corners, espcially when it blocks the scrores when I'm watching sports. The buttons work fine and programming it to my tv was a breeze and I have not had to programme it since arrival.I can't navigate through the television menu though for some reason, but at least I can do it manually using the tv buttons. Overall I'm satisfied with this remote, it's not the original so I can excuse it for where it falls short."
3,Magnavox PM435S 4,"I tried to purchase a remote specificly for my Magnavovox TV/DVD player to replace one that stopped functioning, appeared to be worn out--not a ""battery"" problem. The above device was programmed and function well. But , aparently is subject to accidental ""deprogramming"" while in use, necessitating repeated programming of the device. This is the second ""universal"" device I have purchased. I wish I could find a single purpose remote like the one I got with the TV when I purchased it. Can you help me with this? W. Brown"
2,Didn't work properly,"As mentioned by others the actual product does not look like the photo and is a little on the flimsy side. That did not concern me too much. My problem is that it does not work properly with my Samsung 13-inch color TV. It turns the set on and off and steps up/down the channels but I cannot ehter a two digit channel number and have it go to the correct channel. For example, if I enter ""54"" it goes to ""55"". I tried all the listed setup codes given in the instructions."
2,Not durable,"I bought this b/c it was quite inexpensive. It programmed very easily and I loved it, as it worked with all my components.Then, I dropped it ONCE, and it hasn't worked well since. grrr"
3,Almost Perfect,"This device is excellent when it works. I purchased it for use on my Zenith television primarily. The included code book did indeed include the code for my model. After entering the code, the device was recognized and worked without flaw. Unfortunately, for whatever reason, the remote occasionally clears itself of its code storage rendering it useless until the code is entered again. When it does work, however, no complaints."
1,Not as expected!,"The Seller Rockridge is an awesome provider of quality products and the best in customer satisfaction and service. Yet this mini brass Cups and Balls are NOT the standard ones in the industry. Granted they are of high quality, and appearance, they dont serve the purpose of the routines of the actual Cups and Balls.The seller made the exchange for me without any questions and he did send the larger ones that are specifically made in the industry.I will buy without hesitation from this seller any time, its just that this mini cups and balls are not manufactured to specifications."
3,Its ok,"This book is OK. For a graduate level text, I found that it lacked rigor and difficult solutions to example problems seemed ""hand wavy"". That is, I don't think that it is practical to memorize the general acceleration term for an object (rigid body or particle). Example problems (using Newton-Euler to derive equations of motion) are solved in the text by finding the translational acceleration, then the Coriolis acceleration, etc. and plugging them into the acceleration equation. In practice, if you can write the position vector of an object and you are careful about your inertial and non-inertial frames then calculus will give you the correct acceleration---every time.A strong point of the book is all the problems at the end of each chapter. If you can do them, you can do dynamics. But, Baruh's text before the problems might not prepare you to write the solutions."
4,patience,"For me this takes some patience -- not to listen to it over and over, though thatdoesn't hurt. It's just that the duo get to the groove by the 2nd 2 tracks andthose are awesome. When Wadud is plucking out a bass line while Hemphill is jammingover it, it doesn't get any better. The bowing in the earlier pieces just doesn'twork as well for me, but I usually feel about the same about the bow with the bass."
3,Not Strong Enough,"If this fragrance were in an EDP, then I probably would have given it a 5 start rating. But, the EDT was too faint in fragrance even as soon as a couple of minutes after applying. Although the notes are wonderful, it was too weak to suit me. Casmir has much better sillage. I wish MiraBai had been stronger and I would have loved it."
5,One of the best debut albums ever,"""My Home's In Alabama"" by Alabama is one of the best debut albums ever from any country artist. The first track, the title cut, and their first top 40 country hit, ""I Wanna Come Over"", were originally released on MDJ records. The latter has a full length version on CD and it's longer than the LP version. The other singles they released went to number one in ""Tennessee River"" and ""Why Lady Why."" This was the start of something big for Alabama."
4,CLASSIC.,"WHEN I FIRST HEARD THAT ALBUM, I FELT LIKE AN OLD SUTHERLAND (FROM ""WINNETOU"") ON THE WILD WEST IN THE 1800S. AT EVENING, SITTING NEXT TO THE FIRE, PLAYING MY GUITAR AND SINGING SONGS TO THE LADY SITTING NEXT TO ME.ALL SONGS ARE GREAT (WORTH BUYING) BESIDES ""GET IT WHILE IT'S HOT"". IT'S NOT A BAD SONG, BUT IT DOESN'T MATCH WITH THE OTHER SONGS ON THE ALBUM. PERFECT BALLADS - ""WHY LADY WHY"", ""SOME OTHER PLACE, SOME OTHER TIME"" AND LITTLE FASTER ""CAN'T FORGET ABOUT YOU"" OR ""I WANNA COME OVER"".OLD SOUND OF COUNTRY, GOOD GUITAR ON ALL OF THE SONGS. TIMELESS MUSIC - TO WHICH YOU'LL BE COMING BACK AGAIN AND AGAIN."
1,Overrated hits band,Terrible. I actually liked this band when I was extremely young. I'm glad I woke up and seen them and country music for what it really is.These guys have too many cheesy type of ballads. Their dull and depressing.
5,Superb,"This is one of the best Spaghetti Western I have seen. You have everything. Jokes, gun fights, film music by Ennio Morricone. It plays in the time of the Mexican revolution. Franco Nero is the mercenary who helps the revolutionaries against the Mexican army as well as bad man (Jack Palance). At the end there is a final showdown between Jack Palance and Tony Musante.For Spaghetti Western fans this is a film you need to watch."
2,"Loosely based plot, strays from the point. Low-grade humor.","Basically, this movie revolves around the idea of a genderless person who repeatedly runs into situations where it's gender is in question. This gets old fast and it is very predictable. This movie does have some clever humor which makes the repeated gender jokes acceptable."
1,Doesn't even deserve one star,"You know a movie is bad if goes from the theaters, to the new release shelves, to the $1 rental section all within 6 months. I thought the two-minute ""Pat"" skits on Saturday Night Live were funny, but there weren't two good minutes in this entire movie. Even though it's only about 75 minutes long, I felt like I had been watching it for 2 hours after the first 30 minutes. I just turned it off after that. What a piece of trash! And I thought the Police Academy movies were bad!"
2,"If you enjoyed SNL in the 80's, you'll liked Pat","The movie was bizarre, but we found humor in it. I enjoyed watching the skits on SNL, but the movie was a little too much."
3,"good,but not that funny","a couple funny parts are in this film.i can see why this movie only got one star.because it was kind of stupid and it didnt have that much of a plot.this movie should be considered a romance,not comedy"
4,This movie is hilarious!,"I rented this movie like along time ago and I enjoyed it. I think the movie is alot better than the skits on Saturday Night Live. I hope they make a sequel to it if not then that's okay. They didn't make a sequel to ""A Night at the Roxbury"" yet that was a funny movie too."
2,redundantly not that funny,"Let me give you guys that ""loved"" this movie a hint- it's not that good! Don't get me wrong- I love dumb-funny movies as much as anybody, but it's usually good if it has a plot revolving around more than a neutered fat person. If you want to see a great corny movie, check out ""Better Off Dead"" starring John Cusack. It's really hilarious."
4,The Movie was Hysterical,"I laugh too hard when I see Julia Sweeney play this character. The story is kind of silly, but the characters were worth the watch."
1,Terrible,"This is, quite simply, one of the worst films ever made. Long, boring, stupid, and not funny at all. The character of Pat is funny in the brief SNL skits, but can't hold together for a (almost) feature-length film."
5,"Funny, in a disturbing kinda of way","I found myself laughing where I should have been cringing and perhaps I shouldn't even be admitting to enjoying the movie (smile), but Pat was a well written comedy with thought provoking points hidden deep within the storyline... VERY DEEP.For those who like pulp and cult fiction, this is a good one to add to your TBW (to be watched) list."
3,Any movie is better with a vet from Kids in the Hall,"Not the most inspired comedy ever, but one made better by a comical appearance by Ween. But if you're a die-hard Kids in the Hall fan, check it out. Another great performance of Dave Foley in drag(?)"
5,Oh Pat!! He he he,"We felt Pat, we understand Pat, we laughed with Pat, we cried with Pat, we love you Pat!! We think ""It's Pat"" is one of the most unique and talented story lines of the nineties. I mean, taking one androgynous character and making it fall in love with another? That's sheer genious! And then shuffling the weird, obssesive neighbor (Kyle) into the mix? Who thought of that? They should be rewarded!! We have dedicated all of our free time into the research of Pat and Pat fans everywhere. The fan club is coming soon and we hope to hear from anyone whose been enlightened by Pat! We are still looking forward to a long-overdue sequel, but at least we still have the first Pat in the meantime! Thank you so much Pat for increasing the happiness in our lives!! WE LOVE PAT!!!"
3,"A silly, wacky, fun and entertaining movie.","""It's Pat...the Movie"" was really enjoyable. We got a lot of laughs out of it. Maybe what makes it so funny is that almost everyone has seen or has known an androgynous character like Pat. If you take the movie at face value and try not to analyze it, you'll find Kyle's obsession with learning Pat's gender extremely comical. Rent it!"
1,My eyes! My eyes!...,"Ouch. I just got done watching ""It's Pat: The Movie."" Actually, I saw it three years ago and am still recovering. This movie has gone down in history as one of the worst films ever to be made. The comedy, which is as funny as ""Schindler's List,"" works so hard at producing so little. The plot is a one-joke premise and the joke is funny for less than a heartbeat, then it gets stale and old. Is Pat a man or a woman? Does anyone care after this film? I don't think so. By the end, we still don't know what Pat is, and I don't think anyone is really all that interested to find out. By the way, Pat's played by a woman, Julia Sweeney, who's funnier in everything else she's ever been in."
1,One of the worst movies ever made,"On Saturday Night Live, the ""It's Pat"" skits were always funny. The movie, however, was not. Yes, it is a very bad idea to take a few minute sketch and try to stretch the joke into a 90 minute movie. While it's is not a great movie it is pretty funny at times. Especially the neighbor who becomes so very psycho obsessive in trying to discover Pat's gender."
2,The Ween scenes are better but the whole movie sucks!,Only thing that's great about this movie is that Ween is in it but the rest of the movie is dumb. Watch the scenes where Ween is in it it's hilarious.
1,It's Pat is terrible!,I think the skit from SNL is a whole lot better. I don't really watch SNL that much as I use to it's not that funny anymore most of my favorite comedians died like Chris Farley and Phil Hartman. It was sad to see them gone off the air they made me laugh when they were on. As for the skit of It's Pat and they made it into a movie it can be sort of funny but it looks like they put all of the sketches into the movie and they made the running time 76 minutes long. Like if you are an adult and have a brain of an 11-year-old you'll probably enjoy it but if your probably smart enough then don't watch it. It will probably lose your lack of intelligence forever. It felt like I was watching some lil kids movie at daycare it's really bad. Please do not waste your money on this crap. The best SNL movies are Wayne's World and A Night at the Roxbury. I got them both on DVD. It's Pat is the worse SNL movie I ever seen that needs to be thrown away in the garbage.
4,Strange movie,"I watched this movie (for the first time) on DirecTV a little while ago. Now, I'm a fan of the older SNL series and not so much a fan of the newer SNL generation. How did I miss this movie?I found this movie very funny. I also found this movie very weird. But I guess that's the point. This movie really does make you wonder if Pat is a he or a she. At some points I'm laughing and at other times I was really weirded out but this is a really good classic comedy."
5,Funny Movie,Despite the packaging (When I got it it was loose in it's case) It didn't get scratched.. One of my bf's favorite movies haha
2,misleading advertising,"this product was a good product however, the advertisement of this product is very misleading! you are only getting one mascara brush. pay close attention to the color so you don't order the wrong color."
2,Constant Spills and Drips,"I really dislike this pitcher. It looked good when I bought it, but when you actually pour from this picther, you will likely end up making a mess on the counter or the floor. Something to do with the lip design I guess. The only way I can make this work is to pour VERY fast, and sometimes I just don't want to do that. Would not purchase again."
2,glass pitcher,"The pitcher is attractive, but I wish it were tempered glass. Also it is very heavy, and as I get older it gets harder to lift objects. I will keep it as a gift."
1,disappointing read,"Leach offers a tourist snapshot of ""contemporary China"". His impressions lack substance and originality, give very little pleasure to anyone familiar with the country, and are of little use to those who aren't.The title is most misleading, as this thin book mainly deals with Hong Kong and Taiwan rather than The People's Republic. Such a nave traveler might have failed to notice that Taiwan is a separate country and Hong Kong's national identity is the subject of a heated debate in the former British colony.Gutierrez & Portefaix have done a much better job, but a pocketbook can hardly do justice to their pictures.In my opinion, this is the literary equivalent of a Nissin Noodle Cup."
1,"Should be called ""Diary of a Sex Addict""","Nowadays they have treatment centers for people with this affliction, but way back when this book was published it was considered daring and exciting. The heroine never meets a man she doesn't want to trot off to bed with and describe the coupling in minute detail. After awhile, every time she met a man (no matter how unappetizing) I'd wince, thinking, ""Oh here we go again"" and brace myself. It seemed aimless and pointless and pathetic. At one point the heroine says (moaning yet again about some man who had done her wrong), that he had separated her from the two things that meant the most to her: her child and her writing. But in truth she doesn't seem to care much about either of them and treats them as peripherals in her life while she pursues her sweaty encounters with anyone with a Y chromosome.Join Charlie Sheen, Tiger Woods, and Rob Lowe...just don't write about it."
4,GREAT,this is the 3rd book in the series and i was a little dissapointed. I loved Isadora in first person! but not so much in 3rd. Overall great book and read though.
5,Mass Communication: Living in a Media World,This book was really helpful for a class I took on mass media. I recommend it for anyone who wants to go into the world of marketing and/or advertisement.
4,Speedy Delivery,This book arrived within the same week that I ordered it. Good quality overall. Just some annoying highlighting in the book. Other than that it doesn't impede with the overall quality of the book.
5,Bilingual Dictionary Commercial Trucking,"Dear Sirs, 2009-12-22thanks you much times for sending the book in time and under deter-mined terms from your side.I am quite satisfied with this dictionary, although it is a little untraditio-nally set-up.I give you 5 stars for shipment in time and its proper wrapping-up.Till future purchase at you I remain with best regards Ing.

4,"Some Obvious, Mostly Great","Some tips were a little mediocre, but for the most part a great collection of tips. These killer tips books seem to be mostly for novice users of programs, and in this case that remains true, but since I'm a novice in Dreamweaver, I loved the information contained within."
1,Not sure what the other reviewers are seeing...,This book is not very useful and its silly writing still is annoying.
1,Save your money,"This is another terrible product by InfoUsa. For a small business trying to extract information for mailing lists it's a waste of time and money. It's even worse than SelectPhone, which used to be a terrific software package. You can't extract more than 1000 names at a time, it's hard to use, nothing is co-ordinated for the user. They lie on their promotion and packaging. Nothing works. Don't waste money on ProCD either. I'm trying to find a software program like this that actually works"
1,a good thing gone bad,this is my fourth time baying phonedisc this time it is very slow . they are very greedy they dont allow enough printing because of this i don't recommend it.
1,Product is not for a TDI,Should have stuck with VW OEM parts... Checked with MFG after purchase and they told me that they do not offer a mount for the Passat TDI model. So I don't know why it was listed as a replacement part. The vibration is almost unbearable and seems to be temperature driven... This part is most likely a gas burner part...Wasted time and MONEY...
1,Leonard Maltin is an idiot.,"Leonard Maltin is an idiot, and wouldn't know a good movie if somebody hit him over the head with it. This a fine book, if you only like movies that you don't have to think about. If the movie requires any thought, it's an automatic downgrade.Avoid anything Maltin writes like the plague. Maltin represents the dumbing of film."
1,Good for one thing...,"...namely, watching all the movies that ""Maltin"" gives one star and avoiding those that he considers ""best"". That's basically everything useful about it, other than some occasions to laugh at how Maltin, with his ridiculously shallow knowledge of most topics attempts to be the ""cleverer than thou"" critic - and fails miserably. If what you need are actually good, objective and informative reviews, stick to Roger Ebert and also to the Blockbuster team's video guide."
1,a disappointment,"My previous movie guide, and the one I still use for older films, was ""Robert Hofman's speelfilm encyclopedie"" (yes, it's in dutch): 6th edition from 1995, 1856 pages divided over 2 hardback volumes (the pages are glued but I have yet to lose one), total size 3.35 x 11.61 x 8.66 inch, weighing 3.85 kg and containing 65,000 reviews! You can open the book flat on the table without having to crack the back. Compare all that to this book, or any other guide you can buy today for that matter, and you'll understand my disappointment. Can anyone point me to an internet site with enough reviews to satisfy my needs?"
1,Overlong and Underintelligent,"Maltin seems to have difficulties with any movie that isn't wrapped up inside 2 hours, unless it finishes with slam-bang action sequences (Titanic, Saving Private Ryan, etc.) He appears to have the attention span of an infant when it comes to drama. Here are his comments from several critically (and audience) acclaimed motion pictures: Heat - ""...Overlength...""; Out of Africa - ""...overlength...""; L.A. Confidential - ""...overlong...""; Lawrence of Arabia - ""Loses some momentum in the second half...""; Casino - ""Long, tedious tale...story is overlong...""; Braveheart - ""...denouement (the end of the story) starts to drag..."" Is this guy for real? I guess anyone can write a book and call himself a movie critic. I'm surprised he could sit still long enough. Unbelievable."
1,Leonard Maltin's 2001 Movie & Video Guide,"This is a book I would never purchase. If the editorial reviews by Maltin that are shown on this website are any indication of the book then I would say that Leonard Maltin is an over-rated windbag. It seems that any movie that is not ""Oscar material"" gets a proverbial thumbs down. Whatever happened to watching a fun movie for the sheer entertainment value. I pity him because it seems in the critic business that everyone is racing to put their seal of approval on the ""Oscar"" performances in order to prove their own legitimacy in the public eye. I think that he like other critics have become so involved with disecting a movie that they have forgotten how to just enjoy a movie for what it is. Yes, there are some stinker movies out there and Maltin should save his diatribe for them. Otherwise, Lighten up 'Francsis'!"
2,Cheap-cheap-cheap,"Of interest if you cannot find a movie description in your local TV or video guide.Some reviews are elucidating, but Maltin's apparent ghost writers are uneven and populist: f'r instance, of a maximum of 4 stars, 'Being There' nets a criminal 2 1/2, while trendy trash such as 'Pulp Fiction' gets 3 1/2. [I find Martin & Porter's 'Video Movie Guide' more reliable, and has an exhaustive cast listing, although not in the review itself.] In books such as these, reviews actually written by the 'author' should be marked as such.4 stars out of 5 for usefulness, down one for annoyance factor: 3 / 5 for this book so far, but the paper and printing are shockingly cheap so down to 2 stars: I tried complaining to Signet books, but was unable to track their website. Maybe they'll figure it out for its doubtless next edition . . .Bottom line: read its reviews for plot and participants, not merit."
5,Leonard Maltin's Movie & Video Guide 2001 (Leonard Maltin's,These books are so great!! They allow you to find out who was in the movie you just saw and what other movies they where in. It is so useful to have. It is so much easier than trying to go find it on the internet.
5,I loved this book as a child!!!,"I am so glad to find this book on Amazon.com! I believe this book went out of print for a few years and was near impossible to find. This was my favorite children's book as a little girl. I used to make my older sister read it over and over again (Actually, I was the little sister, so I couldn't make her. She's just a good big sister.) The illustrations by Maurice Sendak are great, and the story is very witty. However, children will still get a health dose of good manners. I can't recommend this book enough!"
5,Great book!,"This is a great book to teach young kids manners without them even realizing they're learning. The book's format is that on each page there's a humorously farfetched situation (like accidentally walking backward into a crocodile while walking down the street) and asks the reader what the proper etiquette would be in such a situation. The next page holds the answer. My kids (ages 6 and 4) laughed at the silly situations and the hysterical illustrations, but most of all they loved guessing the various answers to the central question, ""What do you say, dear?"""
1,Don't waste time or money on this title.,"Not at all helpful in teaching young children about manners/courtesy. Not PC and very violent scenarios. One page asks readers ""What do you say dear?"" when a cowboy comes up behind you and says, ""Would you like me to shoot a whole in your head?"" Not at all suitable for my kindergarten classroom!"
1,would you like me to shoot a hole in your head?,"What do you say, dear? No, thank you!I was looking for another of Sendak's books at the library when I saw that he illustrated this one and placed it in my pile of kid's books for my son. Last night, as we snuggled up to read, I chuckled at the book's first scenario of a kid always wanting a baby elephant, but then turned the page and was definitely not chuckling at the knight cutting off the dragon's head complete with illustration.When I got to the line ""would you like me to shoot a hole in your head"" matched with a drawing of a little boy with a large revolver pointed to his temple I had to close the book. What a nasty sentiment to put in a book for anyone ~ let alone children.There are shelves full of books for kids that are humorous and/or silly ~ without violence. Definitely skip this one!"
2,"Wonderful, funny book marred by sadistic violence","What do you do, dear, when you're reading an otherwise delightful book to your child and on one page there's a cowboy threatening to blow a hole in the child's head?I substituted a less violent idea -- demonstrate some fancy target-shooting. The book was first released in 1958, and I know people that long ago generally had different attitudes towards violence than we do today. I wish it had been updated!I was really shocked, I'm very grateful that my 4-year-old son didn't ask me to explain why I didn't read the words exactly as they were written on the page! The book is rated for early readers, so BEWARE! if you buy it, be prepared to sit down and explain what's wrong and why it's wrong."
2,"Great poetry, bad format in Kindle edition",I borrowed this in hardback from my library and loved it. But this edition is just sad. ALL of the line breaks are missing and that really messes with the flow and presentation of the poetry. I hope someone comes out with a better version.
2,Unimpressed,"I really want a Kindle edition of Teasdale's poetry, but this isn't it. The individual poems are there, but the formatting is awful and there is no clickable table of contents. Luckily I only downloaded the sample so I'm out nothing but my time. I'll keep looking for a better edition."
5,For your Enterprise Collection,This is a must have for anyone that is an ENTERPRISE (TV show) fan. They could have found better photos to put in a calendar but fans will buy anything. This would also be great to add to your general Star Trek collection too. It has all of the typical calendar features.
5,Best book on the subject,"Having read every other reference book on the subject, THE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MYSTERY AND DETECTION, although first published over 35 years ago, remains the most useful and entertaining book about crime and mystery fiction. The pictures are good too."
4,Good Bugs,"very helpful book, wonderful details.will be a great help with our master gardener education programwould recommend this little book anyone looking to identify the good bugs"
1,Save Your Money!!! It Doesn't Work,"There are many things wrong with this product. As an A+ Certified tech, installation should be a piece of cake. Wrong. It has been a couple of days and no go. I will have to hook it up to one of only 2 USB ports on the motherboard to see if that would work but with a powered USB hub, it will not. But the big surprise is the (what I feel)lack of product support. You have a choice of 1. a forum 2. faq 3. email. The manual is all of 8 pages and it starts on Page 2. Better to use a PCI capture card and leave the USB headaches behind."
3,Dumber than your average bear,"Actually a mixed review from my experience. I found it easy to install (with a Sony Vaio > Sony camcorder as my gear). In fact I had a DVD made with some cool special effects in under four hours from opening the box. I am not much of a computer hack either, so easy to use. Hence four stars for this half pf the review.HOWEVER....manual and support is VERY slim. Also certain to read the product info closely (as I did not - stupid bear) as you can only go from analog to digital and not the other way around. Now I have some DVDs that only certain family members can use and I am looking hard at the Dazzle Hollywood as another investment ([price] plus) to be able to edit on my Vaio and return to VHS. I will probably review that product in a week or so, so if you want to make use of my trial and error (or success) hang on....."
4,Iranian music,"There are many different styles in this compilation, making it an educational, and interesting CD, if not entirely satisfying .Maybe I had too much high expectations."
2,Too Small,"The shoes took a long time to arrive and then were too small. Sent them back and reordered, and the next size was also too small. The size is not as represented. Had to go buy running shoes for the boy someplace else."
1,Bad Feature,"This would be a good remote except for one unfortunate feature. Philps calls it ""TV punch through"" volume controls. The buttons on the remote for vol+, vol-, and mute will only operate the TV volume, regardless of what mode you are in. So even though you programed an amp into the remote, the volume controls will only operate the TV volume. This would be nice if you don't have an amplifier, but most people who have need of a 7 device remote use an amp.It is possible to ""learn"" the amp volume controls onto other buttons, but that makes for confusion. Remotes are confusing enough already.The Philips 5 device remote has this same unfortunate feature (I bought that model first!!)I returned my Philips remote and bought a One For All remote that lets me choose which device I can assign the volume controls to."
2,size not expected,"The ring felt a little thinner than expected, but aside from that it's a nice looking ring. The problem is that it fit much smaller than the size listed. I am able to wear it but not on the finger I wanted because it's too small."
5,Classic Book for IR Scholars,"This book was essential in a number of graduate-level International Relations courses I took, as part of my course of study in 2003-2004. I earned my degree in National Security Affairs. This is a cornerstone book - as it delves into many essential concepts in international relations theory. If you really want to understand key root theories in IR, read this book. Keohane does a great job introducing other influential theorists, as well. Other highly recommended authors/scholars/writers on the subject include Walt, Waltz, Krasner, Nye, Morgenthau, and Gilpin. I also, personally recommend papers and books by G. John Ikenberry."
2,Solid perfomance for 3 years,This review is for NN-S560WF which I had for 3 years.No complains but it stopped functioning recently. Panasonic authorized center wants $75 just to look at it. I am going to get a new one for this price. I have also tried to do home repair but this one does not come with a circuit diagram. High voltage generation is done by an electronic invertor assemblly which if goes bad is very difficult to repair. New invertor costs $150 !!!. Most other microwaves use conventional HV units and are repaired easily and parts are cheap.If you are looking for a microwave which lasts longer than this may not be the product for you.
3,Great while it worked,"This microwave performed very well - but only for about 2 years, and then it went on the fritz. It doesnt heat properly anymore and often shuts off in the middle of a timed-cook for no apparent reason.When it did work, we found it very powerful and it would heat food very quickly.But now, it's just another faulty product and we'll have to pay to buy something new, much sooner than I would have expected. My mother had a microwave that lasted like 10+ years with no issues."
5,fobus belt holster taurus pt92,"i found the fobus holster to be very well made. i have been practising the draw all day and after a few fitful starts, now have it down pat. the draw is easy and contolable. i found just behind the hip ideal. gun retention is excellent. i am very pleased with this product and highly reccommend it to gun users. this is the second fobus i own the other is for a ruger lc9. you can't go wrong with this product. if you need a holster, get a fobus."
5,Furious Funk that will Fracture your Femer!,"If you have a weak stomach or heart condition; you have been warned not to listen to this CD. Pulp Fusion dug deep into the crates to find some of these funk classics. The funk on this CD is nastier than a hood rats bed sheets. The funk is 100% uncut raw with no commercial interuptions. If you're looking for comercial music like Will Smith, Puff Daddy and the majority of artists these days, then do not waste your money on this type of music. This CD is about original old school funk with nasty breaks that will leave a frown on your face for days. I'm frowning now and I've had this CD over a week."
4,Great for shopping and compact cars.,"I loved the fact that this folded in half so that it gives you more space in your trunk for groceries. It is soooo narrow that it can fit in between any ailes in stores. It is really easy to open and close. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because I had to lift the infant seat up every time I wanted to get to my diaper bag underneath. The basket is soooo small and very hard to get to when the infant carrier is in place so I would put my cell phone, keys, and wallet in the three pockets on the handle and that solved the problem."
1,Not good for Peg Perego Primo Viaggio,I saw this online and decided to go to the store to buy it. The description says that it accepts the Peg Perego Primo Viaggio baby carrier -- It does not!! The carrier wobbles in the frame and is not safe. Even the sales associates at the store did not reccomend it ... they said that it is best for the Combi carriers. At the suggestion of the sales associates I purchased the Kolcraft universal - which seems much sturdier and safer than the Combi. The only drawback is that it does not fold down as small as the Combi.
3,Life in England just after WWII...,"In this third book in the series, Mrs. Tim now has both children in boarding school and her husband is in Africa, now doing duty with the occupying forces after the war. Hester finds herself all alone, so, thanks to her friend Grace, Hester accepts a job in a hotel in Scotland. Meet another new friend named Erica and get to know Hester's daughter, Betty, a little bit better. Enjoy the day to day life of a very good-hearted lady."
2,Not what I was looking for....,"After a quick breeze through of the contents this turned out to be a business ""how-to"" book with a few chapters about music at the end. The business portion was simple no-brainer material, and the music section wasn't linked in to the business end at, but just examined elements of gigging and gear. If you are looking for a rock-business guide I suggest: Managing Your Band by Dr. Stephan Marcone, All You Need to Know About the Music Business by Donald S. Passman, The Indie Band Survival Guide by Randy Chertkow and Jason Feehan, and JAM! by Jeff Carlisi and Dan Lipson. JAM! is not a straight-ahead business book, but one of the better reads I've found in a while."
2,Medicine for the soul,"Pete Bender is a master at his craft. From the first cut to the last the drums relentless, the flute ever so softly, slowly take you on the journey to becoming whole again.He totally captures the sensitivity of the human soul. He reaches deep down inside you to rid you of your anxieties and helps you to heal your wounded spirit.This album is truly a blessing and one that should be listened to by everyone to heal the grieving soul and restore the balance and beauty in ones' life."
3,"Ok quality, except for annoying glare","This product looks cool and modern, but is not well made. First, there is an annoying glare on the display, regardless of the angle or lighting. Second, the battery that comes with it has a very short-lifespan, such that after a few days the timer stopped working properly. It didn't occur to me it was the battery life since it had only been a few days since I installed it. Got new batteries and now it works fine."
5,"Useful, colorful, and eye-catching!","I purchased this timer as a ""time-out"" timer for my daughter. I have it set on 5 minutes and I just hit start and the digital sand starts going. When 5 minutes is up, it flashes red and has a light beeping sound to alert both me and my daughter when time-out is over. Watching the digital sand fall keeps her busy for a few minutes and she knows she needs to wait for the light to flash and sound to beep and then she's free again.With just a few sessions with this clock she's learned what a ""time-out"" is! It's awesome!Then I just flip it over and it becomes a a clock."
3,quiet timer,"it seems to be ok, except it needs to be close so you can hear it. its not as loud as some timers. that is why i ordered the egg."
4,E-Life - Eleven,"I bought this after reading certain reviews on this site, esp Westwoods (he's massive in the UK, i hear). I think the album is really good and is perfect post concert soundtrack or just right for relaxing to. I have only had it for two days and i've listened to it six times and agree with the other reviwers that tracks 4 and 11 are the strongest but also i really like tracks 3 and 19. I however think that his debut is not worthy of a full 5 stars but if i could i would give it 4.5. This is because there is a lack of variation and experimenting evident in this otherwise strong album. Hopefully his follow-up would satisfy these needs as he becomes more confident and popular. Also the lack of artists featuring is ashame but still it is a fantastic album. I recommend this to all Nate-Dog, Snoop and Warren-G fans aswell as newcommers. Bye!"
4,Superseded Edition of a Classic,"Mary Chesnut's diary of life in the South during the American Civil War is possibly the best of all American diaries. You could spend weeks making your way through the labyrinth of events -- trivial and important -- and personalities found in the diary.This edition of the diary is superseded by a better one: ""Mary Chesnut's Civil War"" edited by C. Vann Woodward which won a Pulitzer Prize for History in 1982. Woodward's edition offers a more complete text and is heavily footnoted with explanatory material. The text in Woodward includes many interesting passages excluded from ""A Diary from Dixie"" because of limitations of space and because some of them reflected unfavorably on the South and Southerners.One virtue of this edition is a fine foreword about the diary by literary critic Edmund Wilson, but Wilson's foreword can also be read in his book ""Patriotic Gore."" I recommend you read Woodward's ""Mary Chesnut's Civil War"" instead of this book.Smallchief"
3,Somehow still obtuse or beyond my brain level.,I have tried and tried to read Eyelyn Underhill because I think she has a lot to say that I need to hear but her manner of writing and stringing her words and sentences together lose me. I need to read her early in the morning when my mind is fresh.
1,"Blah, blah, blah, blah,blah","I am a high school student, so to most of you my opinon doesnt even matter. But here it goes. The Wall is one of the most boring books i have ever read. I have always been very intriqued by the holocaust,so i went into this book looking for something interesting to read.It went on and on about meaningless issues, and was rather hard to follow. I definitly would not suggest this book to anyone, and just to add to that its a wopping 632 pgs long!It does have some high points, but i wouldnt waste your time on it."
3,A depressing novel of life in the Warsaw Ghetto.,I thought The Wall was a good book. It was interesting and informative. It made my blood boil about how life outside the ghetto went on as normal while the Jewish people inside the ghetto were struggling to survive. This book was slow in parts and riveting in others. I thought there should have been more to the ending.
5,This story sticks to your bones,"You can read the other reviews to get an idea as to what the story covers, but I want to share with you my experience as to the impact of its delivery and tale. I read a lot. And it's rare for a book to make me laugh out loud or cry tears. At first, I neither liked nor cared for any of the characters. At the end, I cried; hard. I've never had a story affect me this way."
3,"Useful, but a few technical flaws","I found the book very helpful in passing the NT Workstation exam. As another reviewer mentioned, the test questions are more difficult than the real thing, so if you can take answer all 400+ test questions for an exam you shouldn't have any problem passing the real test. It's unfortunate that both the study books by this publisher and this test book have a few incorrect questions and answers, but I've found this in MCSE study materials from other publishers as well. I find it intolerable that these errors make it to print in a guide for extremely technical material.While I found the test questions very valuable, I won't be buying more study guides from them and will be looking for study guides with fewer technical errors."
5,Excellent exam coverage!,This is the book that got me through the core series tests the first time! It does very well at testing all of the microsoft objectives! I would recommend it to anyone!
4,Good Book!,"This book is a good quick review of key points pertaining to certification tests. I have passed Networking Essentials and NT Server 4 with the aid of this book. The questions are realistic, and the explanations of the answers are very helpful"
2,Mediocre remote. Inferior to other philips remotes,"This remote controller was quite a dissapointment. I am using two other Philips/Magnavox remotes that are far more convenient and operate better. This one does not look like the picture (which looks more like the 425 model). It does not cover the equipment I have (while the 425 model does), It's learning mode is flaky and unreliable, to say the least. The range is shorter then that of the 425S. Conclusion: This would make for a nice ornament (It does look nice, and, if you are lucky you may be able to control some devices."
3,Phillips remote control,The remote that you receive is a phillips learning remote but is not even close to what they show and describe. They list size to be 11x4x1 it is really 6x2x 1/2 inches. The buttons are entirely different and 8 of them are not there. I give it 3 stars because I am able to make it work with my equipment but would give it zero for what it looks like.
3,"Not ""Universal"" enough","I have been deparatley searching for a low cost remote that would operate at least one of my two DVD players. I guess I'm still searching... This remote is very comfortable in the hand with good button layout. I would like to recomend it, but I can't. I have two popular DVD players, and can't find a cheap universal to operate them?! One is a cheap ""Cyberhome"" and the other is a Panasonic DVD / VCR combo. You would think the universal remotes would have cought up to these common players. If you can, check for your specific models codes before purchasing."
1,Only lasted for 3 months,"The remote worked great until after 3 months. I can still use the remote with the built in codes. But after 3 months, the learning feature stop working."
2,Learning mode is not good,"I bought this remote mainly as a learning remote to control a TV and DVR.I was hoping I could use the learn option to assign whatever codes I wanted to buttons on this remote. Unfortunately the learn option is not good, and if you're considering buying it for this reason I would avoid. Also, the buttons are not the most accessable, so using the remote, once you have it working, is rather painful."
2,No directions!,"I got this software thinking that, like most mapping software, it would allow me to print directions between two points. It does not. The maps are adequate but the number of features and the ease of use are pretty terrible."
1,A hotel in my residential neighborhood?,"I'm actually 43 years old, but didn't want to take the time to sign up. Actual rating for this product: NO stars. A research group solicited my involvment with an interview group in Houston, TX, and used this program to produce maps to the interview location, a hotel on the north side of the city (presumably, the same maps were sent to all participants). Although the address was listed correctly, the map showed the hotel in the middle of a residential neighborhood south of Houston, approximately 30 miles away! It's a good thing I did my own research rather than rely on this map. I wonder how many of the other participants missed the interview because of this map?Sorry, but with all the available technology out there, there is no excuse for this."
1,Outdated item,"Beware of Monster batteries and chargers. I bought this one and had problems out of the box. 2 of the 8 batteries would not charge, and the other 6 batteries would charge very little. I called the monster customer service phone number in the manual. I was told Monster has not made batteries or chargers in over a year (as of July '08). So any you buy, just know that they've been sitting around for quite a while, and may have problems with old batteries. The seller (Essex Technology Group) was great and gave me a full refund very quickly. Monster service was good as well."
5,Awesome charger,This is an awesome extremely fast battery charger and totally worth the extra $$$. It comes with a car charger too!!
5,Track List,Consider Yourself Housed - various artists / Great Jones / 1989 /Track list:1} Izzy - Keep On Keepin' On (7:40)2} Bonz - I'm Housin (6:58)3} Passion - You Really Sound Good To Me (7:13)4} Boys Of Darkness - Near Midnight (8:03)
5,Rich Symbolism Open Gates,"Though the pictoral symbols on these cards may not be the most colerful, the images hail to ancient gnosticism and all the mysteries that have tormented the minds of men since the dawn of time. These cards house a myriad of symbolic keys which allows just as many interpretations; lending themselves perfectly to divination, since one truely reads the cards from the soul. These mixed and varied symbols allow the reader to draw inspiration from any number of religious schools of thought, the very fact that attracted me to purchase this deck. I am most highly joyed by the fact that these cards are now in my life."
4,Good!,"I don't know how the negative reviewer ended up with such a bad experience - I received the cards and they are fine. They are not miscut, or badly aligned, or crappily executed. They are what they are, a reconstruction, according to one person, of an historical deck. They are well-made, and fascinating in their own right. The B&W artwork is singularly easy to grasp at first glance, the connections are clear, the symbolism(s) obvious, straightforward and easy to decipher. I have no complaints at all about this deck, it is lovely. It is what I expected, not the ""ultimate Tarot deck of All-Time."" I can't help but think that ""someone"" expected this particular deck to provide answers that weren't forthcoming, and when the same old tired, limited, unwilling-to-work talent got the same pitiful results with this deck as with others, he/she turned bad-mouth and trashed every facet of the experience. Too bad, the cards are useful."
5,A beautiful deck for study,"My deck came in today and I'm happy to report that the Quality Control is back. The graphics are sharp, the contrast is spot on, the deck is perfectly cut, the cards are glossy and they shuffle wonderfully.It is also one heck of a deck. I picked up the energy straight away as I went through the cards prior to their first shuffle. I find mine is a potent deck; it holds many secrets and has many lessons to reveal.I will use this one for in depth study but would be more than willing to use this deck for clients. I believe this is a great deck for transition into other esoteric decks such as the Haindl. I'm very pleased with the Hermetic and recommend other serious readers to give it a go, especially if you relate to black and white."
5,Hermetic Tarot is great for those interested in Golden Dawn,"This deck reminds me of Crowley's. Its black and white drawings are crammed with so much symbolism, it can be overwealming at first. But it all becomes very clear with experience. I use this deck for meditative purposes. The little booklet is a bit sparse on interpretive meanings, check out Wang's book on the Golden Dawn deck."
2,should have done a better job on printing,"I was really excited when I found this deck on-line. I had the original printing from the 80's and had given it to a friend never to be seen again. The images are fantastic and filled with symbolism. However, this edition was so poorly executed I actually gave the cards away after I received them. The printing was so off on the images it almost looked like the images were out of focus some cards were worse than others but the pixelation was too much for me...Then again the price of the cards was not high. So if you had the original and get this one I feel you may be unsatisfied. If you never had them and want a copy go for it for the price. I'm going to try and find a used copy on line they are not cheap for the original."
3,Poor quality recreations.,"About 35% of the cards are sub-par from the originals. I have both new and old decks. The first edition has sharp clean lines on the art, the new edition looks as if the didn't have access to the original art and scanned first edition cards as the master copy. Some of the art is much darker loosing the detail of the pictures.They also changed the size of the card to make it a bit bigger, unfortunately this causes the back of the cards to loose the balanced look of the geometric shapes because they are stretched length wise. This deck will work but its not an equal to the original."
2,"Art-wise, not so great","When I recieved the entire deck and looked through all the illustrations, I felt them to be lacking in comparison to the examples provided online. Maybe I don't know very much about the artist, but I felt the overall art, while I'm sure it was meaningful, to have an immature look to it. I hate to say this, but kind of like the Led Zeppelin Icarus drawing. The drawing style is crude in an unskillful, unintentional way.Say what you want of my critique, but I know that in the art of Tarot you should have a meaningful bond with your cards (and I have plenty of decks myself that share this bond with me) but I never felt it with these."
1,Unsatisfying deck,"Overall a very crude and amateurish deck. If you are interested in hermetic Tarot, the Crowley-Harris deck is truly all you need. This deck, with its clumsy, off-kilter, amateurish art and complete lack of color (and yes, that is important when working with a Tarot deck) is not worth bothering with. There are any number of better Tarots that address hermetic material and concepts. I fail to see why this badly drawn, poorly drafted, confusing deck would attract anyone. The Crowley-Harris deck and the Cicero and Wang decks are still available, and are far superior to this colorless, crude mess."
4,Lovely tarot cards,"These were perfect to add to my growing collection of tarot cards. They're beautiful, incorporate a lot of mythological and occult elements, and the fact that they're based on the Order of the Golden Dawn's traditions makes them even better. Well worth the money I spent."
3,Similar in theme to Heidi,"I foolishly gave my weatherbeaten hardcover of this book as a gift to a friend of mine when I was thirteen. If only I had known how valuable it was! It's a lovely book, very similar in story and theme to Heidi. Written with the same innocent descriptive tone, but with a few different plot points. Spyri uses a light touch on serious topics, so this book can be a little sad, but never actually scary. Books like it are The Secret Garden, The Little Princess, and of course, Heidi."
2,Very Vague and too wordy,"The book is another bad book from Roger Toogood. This will be the last time that I make this mistake!!! Does anyone want a book for free? The exercises are very poor. The book is poorly written and the graphic quality is ......... The book is very confusing and vague for the new user. I wonder about the advance user? After reading the book, I still do not understand Wildfire. The book is too wordy and is very vague. I am very surprise that he is selling books. I agree with one reviewer who wrote, ""Its ludicrous to expect someone to read 3-4 pages to get to know something simple like modifying feature dimensions or setting references""."
4,Not quite what I'd hoped for...,"This ""Advanced"" manual wasn't quite what I'd hoped for. I was looking for instructions on setting up drawing formats (including automated BOMs). While this book had some basic information, there wasn't enough in the book to start from scratch and develop a fully-formed drawing format for several sheet sizes. In particular, the book assumes some system parameters exist by default; however, when running Pro/E without a PLM system (small company, single license), they don't automatically exist, and it isn't obvious how do an end run to compensate for this lack.In thumbing through the book, it looked like it had plenty of other step-by-step walk-throughs which may be helpful in the future, so it's not a loss, just deferred gratification."
5,A must read!,I love this series on Jill Lewis! They keep my attention...I can't put the book down! This action thriller series will keep you busy as you follow Jill Lewis through her exciting adventures!
3,nothing special,"2 1/2 stars is what I really want to give, but....Its not a bad album, but its certainly not a good one eighter. The vocals are annoying and the vocal style and music is very repetative. Most of the ongs sound similar and after about the 4th track, you'll hit the eject button. Of all the new synthpop bands signed to A Differnt Drum, I have to say that they are not impressive at all, but just ok. I think I am being generous with my 3 stars. You see people comparing this album/band to ECHO IMAGE....wrong...they sound nothing like Echo Image, infact its a insult to EI to be compared to them. There is very slight resemblance to the sound, but I rate Echo Image's quality of music/vocals a (10) vs. Rupesh Cartel's (2) rating. Comparison falls very short."
3,better once upon a time,"good amount for the price, but scent did not last as long on your body as the origional sample did from store back once upon a time."
5,Nice Perfume,One of my all time favorite scents. Soft but noticeable. I get lots of compliments when wearing it.
5,I love this fragrance!,"I love that Amazon had this fragrance at an affordable price. The cheapest I could find the 3.4oz Champs Elysees anywhere was for $76.00. I saved a bunch buying this online. Oh, and did I mention that this fragrance smells so beautiful, and it stays on all day."
5,Five stars,The discipline the book describes has been important to me for years; the author was my teacher. This copy was a gift to s friend who has also found it to be helpful.
5,Best book I've ever read on insight meditation!,Simple and written in plain English. Larry Rosenberg is a wonderful teacher. I read it over and over and get something new out of it every time.
2,Save your money,"If you are looking for an instructional video on volleyball technique, then this dvd is not for you. Instead, the entire dvd just shows what appears to be members of UCLA's volleyball team running through volleyball drill. At least you get a good view of the gym."
4,A few questions answered,"This is a Kitty Kellyesque biography of one of the more troubled celebrities of the 20th century. I am a huge ""What's My Line"" fan and have read bios/memoirs of Bennett Cerf, Fred Allen and Arlene Francis. This pretty much completes the quartet since nothing is available on John Charles Daly. The book provides detail on the professional triumphs and the personal problems. Both were so much a part of the Dorothy Kilgallen story. It certainly discusses her untimely death in 1965 and the on-going controversy surrounding it 4 and half decades later. It's an interesting look behind the curtain of New York cafe society from the 1930's to the 60's."
4,"Very Nice Shorts, but....","I have purchased several of these cargo shorts over the past couple of years and would recommend them to anyone. The quality and sizing for most of my purchases has been quite consistent. However, of the last two that I purchased, one of the pair had a larger waist band than all of the others. I hope this does not indicate deteriorating quality control. But overall, I would say that these are well-made, very comfortable shorts at a reasonable price."
3,Too Short!,"Reasonable quality, but they are a little too short to be fashionable. Think ""highwaters"" for shorts.Much prefer Wanglers..."
2,Disappointed with Fendi quality,"I purchased this wallet in (nero) black on black and I was very disappointed with the quality for the price! Also I never received a certificate of authenticity which was upsetting, Amazon did give me a small discount as they did not have another one to exchange it for but I even offered to take another color but they were sold out! I just don't think it was very good quality for Fendi!"
1,Very Disapointing,"Bought four of these this past summer. Best range we've experienced is about 1 mile. That was once and the planets must have all been aligned ""just perfectly"". Usually get only a 1/3 to 1/2 mile. Two of the four units lately are so staticy and garbled you can't carry on a conversation. As soon as I get a chance their getting shipped back to Uniden under warranty."
2,Tedious and self-congratulatory,"There is a character in this book who most readers will recognise. Simon is an acquaintance (rarely a friend) who must ""win"" conversations. He is smug and asserts 5 words where one would suffice.While Mr. O'Donnell may identify with Tad, the sterotypically sweet main character, he really seems to me to be so much more a Simon. His writing is laboured and his sense of sentimentality, while earnest, is always overcome by a need to be clever. I like writers to be clever but more than that, I like them to write characters, not to prove to me that they know a whole lot of really big words. Mr. O'Donnell's writing lacks depth and humanity. I understand that Finding Homer is his better work but this piece of tripe will prevent me from experiencing that book."
1,Warning! DO NOT BUY !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I purchased the first set of bulbs and the first one went out in 3 weeks and the second bulb went out in a week after. I thought it was just my luck and I purchased another set. Guess what, the second set lasted me for only 1 week. The bulb is bright and white but what good does it do if it does not last. I know that it has nothing to do with the way I handle the bulbs, I am very sure that I did not touch the glass part of the bulb when i installed it. Stay away from the product and stick with stock, they last much much much longer."
1,Not what I thought it would be,"This book was not at all what I thought it would be. The title sounds like it should be a good resource for starting a well-stocked modern country retreat or something like a hunting cabin. In reality the book rambles on and on with anti-government rhetoric and theories, that I personally don't agree with or support. The author sounds like a loon, completely crazy. He goes on and on about ""avoiding detection"" and ""fighting the government"", things that someone who is doing what they should be doing shouldn't need to worry about."
1,Ragnar's Worst,"I have I library full of Ragnar Benson, this is unquestionably his worst. The book is very short, and only barely touches on a range of subjects. It reads like the table of contents of a much better book! Don't discount Ragnar though, he has a lot of great books out, this just isn't one of them."
2,"basic, lacking in depth of subject","The book is interesting but too basic. The book could possibly be of use for someone who is new to the subject. Benson only touches on material in a overview. The book would have been a better value, if he expanded on the subjects that were addressed. Benson has written many other books that are worth buying, this is not one of them. Read Benson's other books to better understand the subject material, they covered their respective subjects in much more detail."
2,Not as I expected,"The book was much too vague. I expected lists and concrete ideas, not statements like ""I think it would probably work to:"" or ""Some people have told me they have"". I would not buy it again. Not enough information for the price."
3,Buy the older versision of this book.,"This is a newer written version of the survival retreat,I personaly find the older version to be of more help to me.Not that the new book doesnt have alot of updated info in it but i still find my roots in the older book."
1,Glad I got it at the library,"This popped up as a book that Amazon thought I'd be interested in. I've been fooled by those reccommendations before, so I got it at the local library first. It was a big letdown.As other reviewers have written, there were no concrete techniques; no take-away's from this book. There was a paragraph or so on ""disappearing"", but it primarily served as a teaser for another Paladin Press Book on hiding your idenity. There was nothing on the design, selection or provisioning of the survival retreat (since ""that information was covered in other books"").I read it in a couple of hours; many pages are little more than full page, stock-image photos. I could have read it in even less time had I decided to skip over the screed about black helicopters, Waco, etc.The title has potential to be a good book, but this fails in the execution."
3,Surviving government repression,Moderately useful. The greatest danger in this book is considered to be repressive government. The actual construction and stocking of a retreat is given short shrift. The chapter on finding fellow retreaters is worthless. Also not as readable or entertaining as many of Benson's books I've read.
2,Another Okay Book,"Again, just another okay book. Most of the information can be gotten for free if you were to just join one of the many like-minded yahoo groups. The information would be more up to date and you would have the direct interaction of people trying to accomplish the same goals. In the books defense though, when it was written, yahoo groups wasn't even a concept."
1,not very good,"this stuff does not lubricate very well or warm up at all, my girlfriend and I kept waiting for it to warm up or do anything other than make our skin shinyThis review may only legally be shown directly on Amazon.com"
3,2 Books in 1 ?,"If you want a history of every Mayan archaeologist + the history of rivalry between major Mayan cities ... this is a good summary of the most recent books written on the subject as far as I can tell.Recent translations of the Mayan stellae give new insights into the Mayan obsession with royal blood and their cities being constantly at war for power (obviously) and for the capture of rival royals from nearby cities for sacrifice due to the ""power"" of their royal blood.This is a big departure from the widely held ""tree hugger"" image of the Mayans.(At least the Mayans were selective ... the Aztecs, Toltecs etc didn't seem to care which school you went to !) ... so I guess the Mayans can still be considered more ""sophisticated"" than their neighbours ...This book suffers from information overload and can be very heavy going. To be true to the book title it should have minimised the infinite detail on archaeologists and stuck to the Mayans ... I'd give this 1/2 of the book a 4.5"
4,Lotus Guide magazine,"Beyond the Indigo Children: The New Children and the Coming of the Fifth World(Bear, 2005; ISBN 1-59143-051-8) By P.M.H. Atwater, L.H.D.A fascinating and instructive book that provides a wonderful, grounded `voice of reason' among all the misinformation that's being bandied around about today's children.""--Sandie Sedgbeer, managing editor, Children of the New Earth MagazineVery helpful in Beyond the Indigo Children are the cross references with other religions, folklore, and prophecies. No matter where your interests lie, you will find this book most informative in clarifying historical timelines and the events leading to this moment in history, at which we seem to be taking an evolutionary leap in our genetics. What may be more important is ""why"" we are making this leap now.Rahasya Poe, Lotus Guide Magazine and Author of ""To Believe Or Not To Believe: The Social & Neurological Consequences of Belief Systems"""
2,more of same,"I have enjoyed this authors other books, but this one is repetative and the authors evaluation of the children she writes about is less than professional. I would not recomend this book to parents with young children with behavior problems. There are reasons other than the ones given for childhood problems. It is not fair to restrict ones views with the opinions in the book"
5,book recieved was....,"way better than described and arrived faster than expected. had been looking in yard sales and stores for this book for my sister for her birthday. i had seen it a a library and thought she would be so very interested so i told her about it. i am still stunned at how fast it came and the condition was not good; it was excellent, this is my several times purchase and all i have bought has been wonderful. thanks again."
5,Great blues...even greater saxophone,Wonderful blues music with the greatest sax player of all time. Can't beat the combination! Great CD.
5,Decision at Doona,I have been an Anne McCaffrey fan for many years. It is interesting to come into closer contact with her with this book.
2,A Bad Decision,"I shouldn't have read this book. To be fair, I live in a country that doesn't speak English so it is rare to find a book I can read. But I could have spent my time better having my skin scraped off in the traditional bathhouses. The book begins long-winded, and there is enough hope that things will happen that you continue. A future Earth where there are too many people- sure, it's been done a lot, but it holds promise. But they get to the new world, and then...nothing. After a while, a few plot developments. And then nothing. It goes in these spurts- and when there is finally a denouement, you are left profoundly disappointed. Giant creatures show up, to provide some interest, but McCaffrey doesn't know how to use them, and they pass by unrequited.Skip this. Find something else."
5,The beginning of another great series by Ms. McCaffrey,"I hate to say I've been around this long, but I still have my April '69 copy. I have the whole series...as I do all of her works. This is a really great premise of 2 extremely different clutures which are remarkably alike. From the common people to the way their worlds are run...and how they can work together when they work at it. This is one of my favorite series period...and I recommend it highly to all of ""the next generation""!"
2,Disappointingly limited.,"I enjoyed this book as a child, but re-reading it as an adult was disappointing. It's hard to believe I didn't notice at the time how absolutely pathetic the female characters are. Though set in the future, women cook and look after children - that's it! The protagonist's wife is the only woman who gets to say more than a sentence or two and she spends most of her time in tears. Except when cooking. The author was able to create female characters who weren't idiots in the Pern books, so it's surprising that she made no such attempt here. Even thirty years ago, this should have seemed oldfashioned, and it certainly isn't necessary to the plot. Perhaps the sequels were more believable in this area, but I am reluctant to try them now."
1,Avoid Vinotemp based on my experience,"I bought one of these. It stopped working after about 18 months.Vinotemp would not recommend anyone for service. Called someone, who got the wrong part twice. Called someone else, he (I hope) figured out the right part. Vinotemp will not send part without signed and faxed papers. Part and shipping is under $30.Vinotemp appears to me to be a rinky dink outfit whose stuff is hard to service."
4,Vinotemp 60 Bottle Wine Cellar - Good Purchase,"The Vinotemp 60 Bottle Wine Cellar was a good purchase for the price. It's very quiet and the cooling system within the unit seems to be consistent.My only issue with the wine cellar is that it claims the unit can hold 60 bottles however it's a very tight squeeze. I would say the unit holds about 50-55 bottles. The shelving has two design issues:1.)the shelves are not spaced far enough apart to hold non-standard shaped bottles of wine.2.)the shelves are not concaved enough to keep the bottles from rolling.All the same, I'm satisfied with the purchase and would recommend the Vinotemp Wine Cellar."
1,Frozen Wine and Terrible Customer Service,"This thing worked fine for a couple of years--then I came home to find 7 bottles of wine frozen solid! No warning, no sign of any problems except a little bit louder noise from the compressor. Vinotemp literally laughed over the phone--all they cared about was whether it was still under warranty. Absolutely no concern, no ownership of the problem. I'll never buy another product from them and I recommend you don't either. What idiot would build a wine cellar that even has the capability to freeze? What a lousy product. I bought the damn thing to keep wine from going bad and now I have 7 bottles ruined for sure and 51 more that are probably not worth drinking.To the reviewer who ""disagreed"" with other reviewers who'd described problems--watch out! I would have written the same thing last week. Now I know better."
1,Vinotemp is the WORST Company EVER!,"Do not buy any products made by Vinotemp! My first unit BROKE within 3 weeks. The thermostat stopped working and the temperature rapidly dropped to 40 degrees. I returned it myself to the manufacturer and the employees were extremely rude! After returning home with my replacement, I found this new one has a big dent in the top. Vinotemp has zero customer service and terrible, faulty products. Do yourself a big favor and do NOT buy a Vinotemp."
1,Malfunctioned in 18 months,"This is a very poorly made product. I had 40 bottles of good wine frozen together when the unit malfunctioned and dropped below the lowest setting. Would never consider another product from this manufacturer. From reading other reviews, this product failure does not seem rare."
1,Envious of those with frozen bottles!,"Unfortunately I purchased the stainless version of this item 10 months before it was to be used in a new house. It seemed to work fine, albeit fairly noisily, for 7 months, but then it stopped cooling altogether. Since I was out of warranty I had an appliance guy look at it who told me there was a faulty switch which caused the compressor to be turned on constantly, which eventually overloaded and fried it. He also said it would be too expensive to repair, more than it's initial cost. Whatever; all I know is that it only lasted 7 months. I have not yet attempted to contact Vinotemp, but based on other reviews I am not predicting success. I did buy it at Costco, and they sometimes will take all kinds of things back, we'll see... My next unit will not be a Vinotemp. I recommend going with companies with longer warranties."
1,Avoid Vinotemp,"Bought this from Costco about five years ago. The price was right and the size was ok. It worked well for a while but like many other reviewers, we've had problems with ours. First it stopped running and I was able to find information on the web (not from Vinotemp) on the part that might have failed. I replaced that part and it was ok for a while. In the last week it had been fairly loud with the compressor running constantly. Now I have the dreaded ""LL"" error. As another reviewer mentioned, it's ridiculous that the controller detects the temperature is too cold but it does not turn off the compressor. It's a poor quality product with no support."
4,Vinotemp VT60,"We've had the stainless steel VT60 that we bought from Costco about 5 or 6 years ago. It's fine for us. No ""LL's"" on our unit thank goodness. A little wierd about how it stacks bottles but if you have a standard wine bottle, you shouldn't have any problem putting in the max number of bottles by alternating bottom-top-bottom-top etc. as you stack them on the shelves. Bottom shelf is for random sized bottles but won't fit large champagne size bottles. We are satisfied with our purchase. One star discount due to wierdness of the shelving for other than standard sized bottles."
1,Vinotemp -- awful !,"Ive had two of their products, both failed within 1 year or less -- no way to get service. BUY ANOTHER BRAND ------- All the bad reviews are correct."
3,dis-a-POINT-ed,"I'm not at all bothered by the spiral binding--it's what's inside that counts. And what's inside is written in an upbeat, sparkling, conversational, encouraging way. However, it's for beginners. There's little here I haven't been told by many other teachers, so I feel the littlest bit bamboozled. I was hoping for insider tips on how to turn into Agatha Christie and write my book in 40 days. Melton's answer is meat & potatoes: sit down and grind it out. Don't stop for meals or Sunday school. If you live in a cabin in primitive Alaska, you can do this. If you have a household to run, disabled husband, fulltime job, 6 llamas, 4 grandchildren, and bill collectors at the door, it's trickier. I will look further and somewhat more skeptically..."
1,WTF!!!,"Oh my god seven hundred ninety nine and ninety seven cents are you out of your mind? And for a used book online, the book is at least 20 dollars if not less."
1,"Blueberry flavor, no cinnamon","in this coffee. I think this is hands down the most dissappointed I have been with this brand of coffee.When opening the package you get a strong sweet smell, like a cigar . I didn't notice any cinnamon at all. This being my favorite brand, I decided to give it a chance and see what happened after brewing, it tastes just like it smells....I found no expiration date on the box, so perhaps it was expired. I wouldn't recommend this flavor to anyone."
5,Return of My Brain,"I started using Focus Factor more than 5 years ago and stopped for a period of time because of the cost. When I stopped I realized I couldn't think as well and found myself in a state of confusion at times. When I saw I could purchase Focus Factor on Amazon for a less expensive amount, I ordered it and started taking it once again. It was very helpful when a new computer system was offered at work. I am not the best on computers and it usually takes a little longer for me to absorb the information. Focus Factor kept my mind clear, did its job and I learned the new system quite well. Now I'm ordering it again not only for myself but also for my boyfriend. Both of us are 70 yrs. young and we're trying to keep it that way. There's a lot to keep up with these days and with the help of Focus Factor, we'll do just fine.Ernie MelingNorth Carolina"
4,In the middle of midterms...,"I started taking this yesterday and am surprised by how well it works. For the first time in months I was able to sit down and really study. Maybe its placebo, but I don't think so. It's pricey, but worth it if you have a lot of exams to take. Doesn't leave you jittery like no-dose or other products with a lot of caffeine."
2,May not good if you have sleeping isssue,I did not like it much as it seems to interfere with my sleep. I just tried to take 1 pill in morning and even then it keeps me awake. Not sure how any one takes recommended 4 doses.
2,made it hard to fall asleep,"I only took the product for 3 days and at half dose. If taken first thing in the morning, it kept me up an extra hour later than usual but ot caused me to have unrest-full sleep in the early morning. Maybe that goes away after a while. But from my experience these things are cumulative. It did help me ""focus"" , but then so does a cup of coffee! Finding something for focus, that doesn't interfere with my sleep, continues to elude me."
4,A classic tool of the field geologist's trade,"This classic is the best single volume reference for the identification of fossil invertebrates. It was a staple for working field geologists for decades. This is because the identification of ""index fossils"" was, and is, the handiest way to date strata in the field.The book is organised by phylla: Protozoa, Porifera, Coelenterata, Echinoderma, Annelida, Conodonts, Bryozoa, Brachiopoda, Mollusca, and Arthropoda. There are also sections on fossil plants and miscellaneous objects of probable organic origin. Everything is illustrated by crisp, sharp, photographic plates, clearly indexed to the corresponding text.By today's micropaleontological standards, the Protozoa section is pretty thin, but otherwise this is still a very useful volume."
4,Still the essential reference,No other single volume can compare with this classic. Any serious student of paleontology or sedimentary geology or any serious amateur collector should have a copy. And with several copies available for less than $100 - compared to the $35 I paid in 1959 - it is a bargain. Death of older geologists and discards by librarians who think because of the date it is useless (I personally know of three university libraries that have discarded their copies!) maintain the supply.Only four stars because:1) Treatment of protozoa is too scanty to really be useful.2) Many species have been reclassified so one must do further research on names.3) Some geologic ranges will have been refined.
3,Its ok,"I thoought this case branded with the name Epiphone (Gibson), would have the same quality as the instruments they manufacture. It is definetly a 20 foot case. As in, It looks great from twenty feet away. Upon close examination the latches are cheap and the case doesn't close all the way. However it fits my Epiphone MB 250 like a glove. When the tops up. Probably would not recomend to anyone else, without warning. Perhaps if it would have been made in USA and not china I may have gotten a quality product. Didn't see that in the advertisement."
2,I would try something else,"It gave me a decent looking tan at first, but it took many, many coats. I really didn't see a tint where I applied. It says it leaves a long lasting tan, which it didn't. It says to reapply every day or 2 which is to often for me and when it faded it left me looking blotchy. I don't think its worth it. I would try something else first."
1,This book is worthless,If you are new to Quark this book might prove to be useful. If you have been using Quark for over a year I doubt there is anything in there that would help you significantly. There is nothing in this book that isn't in any other Quark book or even Quark's own documentation. Any Quark book by David Blatner would be far more useful. To call this book Killer Tips is a Joke!
5,Must have book however beware defective binding,"It is hard to find anyone painting better WW2 figures than Calvin Tan. If you are into painting 1/35 WW2 German figures this is a absolute must have book however beware of a defective binding, after very moderate careful use the pages in my book started falling out shortly after I bought it here brand new on Amazon.The book has good photos and very good and clear descriptions of Calvin's techniques. Many of the construction and painting techniques will be beyond almost everybody's skill level never the less studying this book should improve your abilities and enhance your enjoyment of the hobby.This book must be an early work in this book because you can tell Tan's latest works are noticeable improved where he sculpts most of the figure and doesn't modify and use existing commercial figures anymore. Also I think possibly Calvin has changed/improved his face painting technique since he wrote this book."
2,"Should be titled ""How to sculpt figures that happen to be SS""","If you are looking for a book with some history and background to the SS and their uniforms, with great ""how-to"" write-ups on painting them, this ain't the book. If you are looking for a general ""how-to"" manual on sculpting custom figures, this is a pretty fair account of that endeavor. Seems more like a ""look how good I am at making custom figures"" self-glorifying publication than a true modeler's resource... Disappointing..."
1,XL hat wasn't even close to being a L,The hat was suppose to be an XL size yet it wouldn't even fit my friends head who normally wears a Medium. All of this after having to wait almost 3 weeks for it to deliver. Very disappointing.
5,Convenient. Period.,"First, these radios don't have a great range (we get about 1/2 mile or so in our neighborhood). They use little AAA batteries. They don't have privacy codes, etc. But, I rarely have one away from my side.Our old house has an intercom system which probably hasn't worked since the Bradys were happily married. Replacing it would have cost over a grand. FRS to the rescue.We bought the pair, as well as 12 rechargeable batteries and a charger, and now we just put in the batteries and clip them to our belts or drop them in our pockets and go about our business. The next day, we swap out the old batteries, and they are good for another day.The squelch works great, but rarely, we get mild interference, so we switch channels. (To be honest, I doubt we do that more than once a week.)The bottom line is that they are small enough, that you forget you have it on until the other person needs to reach you.Get a charger, you wouldn't want to have to feed these things batteries."
4,"Cheap and OK, eats batteries quick","I use this where I work, and it's range is good. But if I use it for 3 days, the batteries are dead. Definitely worth it for occasional use, but not daily."
1,Not helpful,"This is perhaps the worst book ever written, ever. I was forced to buy this book for my class and I have regretted every penny I've spent on this ""book."" Needless to say, I do not recommend this at all. It skips many steps in its example problems. It doesn't even explain how to take a determinent of a 3 x 3 matrix. It assumes that you remember that. So, for the love of God, stay away."
3,Bad reviews are from people that can't do Math,"There's nothing wrong with this book! It has all the solutions in the back which is awesome and the solutions manual covers every type of problem presented in the book, although it does bounce randomly about. This book isn't great though because it doesn't cover all topics fully, especially graphing some of the D.E.'s. The majority of the content is solid and easy to follow. Time is spent equally between logic and doing examples. You'll be able to learn from this book if you take the time to read it.People who give this book bad reviews can't 'read' math and that's why they don't like it. I HAVENT FOUND A SINGLE MISTAKE YET!!!"
3,disappointing solutions manual,"solutions for chapter 2.3 were close to useless. lots of missing characters, tips so brief as to be useless. all in all, really a pretty poor performance. the author obviously didn't take his job seriously. but i'll give him the benefit of the doubt for now and hope the solutions are more complete and helpful in future sections.will update this review when i finish the course."
3,Differential Equations is never exactly an easy class,"I bought the book new on here simply because no used ones were available. This book didn't get a lot of use by me because my diff-eq teacher didn't completely follow the book. However there were some very good examples in the book that definitely helped me out in understanding what was going on in the course. As I said in the title, differential equations is not an easy class, so you can't expect this book to make it cake, but it'll get you farther than just searching the internet IMO."
1,"Boring - - A hard, cold, joyless book","In all fairness, my impression of this book actually comes from their 3rd edition, which I used in my first Diff. Eq. (DE) course. However, I remember seeing later versions in various bookstores, only to see little change. I was a good student in math, but grew to hate DE because of this book. It was written in a very complex, dry & boring way, with virtually no graphics, and the examples were never explained enough (i.e. to give you a solid intuitive feel of the subject). Thank God for Schaums Outline to get me through the course. As a practicing engineer, I have found other books, calculators (HP-48GX, TI-92, etc.) and the computer to restore my interest and fascination in DE. I wish Steven Speilberg could do a movie showing how fascinating differential equations really are, because this book sure doesn't."
1,University Student's Openion,"Please take this advice; I have been using this book for the past four months.This is a rare occasion. I never take to the time to go to a site and write a review unless there is some outstanding reason. This is my fourth year as an engineering student and while I have had some bad books, I have NEVER had a book this bad. For example, the text almost never gives full examples let alone examples on how to do the practice problems/homework problems. When the text gives example problems, it will randomly skip important steps. Ironically, in a lot of cases, it will skip the step/method that is being covered in the section. Also, the text mainly discusses theory and usually doesn't really show how to solve these equations. Furthermore, the solutions manual is just as bad. Solutions are given in a sloppy manner that are unclear and incomplete. I would not recommend this book to any university as an introductory differential equations text."
5,great book about kids yoga,I Love Yoga (Yoga for Kids)A great picture tool of kids taking yoga. These kids are not beginners; they have a great command of yoga and are inspirational to the teacher just starting out. The photographs are good and set a clear picture of what the asanas should look like. A nice addition to your personal librabry
4,Terrific South African Writing,I never properly understood this book until I lived in South Africa. The myth of the veld -- dating back to the early 20th Century in South African literature -- and the use of land by white South Africans historically is a very powerful force in the region. This book explodes the myth of the veld and the respect some have had for the earth in a way that is very compelling.
1,Overrated,"Got this from a friend as a gift. I expected a bit more from this author, considering her past success and fame, but I have to admit that is far too overrated as a writer. The characters lack dept and her oversized ego is all over the pages. I would not recommend it to anybody."
3,Sticky noodles!,Pleasant spicy flavors but noodles break apart & form a small sticky mass when rinsed as directed.
1,Good old-fashioned lesson in information control!,"Shame, shame on our Mr. Baker, trying to explain to us the reasons why limiting privacy to those who have ""worthy"" causes should be the only ones with the means to keep secrets secret. It looks like the bureaucratic ""bull"" can't keep up with the rest of us. People are fed the notion that ""hackers"" are individuals who like to promote choas. NOT SO, I SAY! We just like figuring things out. Anyone who reads this, please go and talk to that computer nerd next door, or the geek who works with you.... You'll see, we don't like people who break the law either. BUT THIS! Geeze........."
1,This book is awful,"Baker succeeds in his attempt to ruin free commerce in America, and throughout the world. I'm sick of people like himself trying to screw the normal citizen out of more and more money as the corporations continue to issue unrealistic and unfair demands on the public. I definitely disapprove of this trash literature and hope others will be able to see through his lies as well."
1,Chipping away at freedom,"Mr Baker seeks to justify a policy which will arbitrarily restrict your access to information and privacy. Quite an unpleasant surprise! Combine that with his patronizing tone, and you have a thoroughly unpleasant book.I returned my copy."
1,Skimpy wire for 0 gauge,"I have installed many stereos and this cable is much closer to 4 gauge than 0 gauge. It has a decent overall diameter but sadly most of it is insulation. If you want a good wire look for ""kolossus fleks"" and you won't be disappointed."
4,A good introduction to Internet Job Searching,"This book includes general exercises on discovering your skills, determining the kind of job you want, doing research, and creating on-line resumes, cover letters,and personal cyber-commercials. Tools for keeping organized such as cyber address books, a URL log, and a flow chart are emphasized. An appendix discusses Internet basics. (This review appeared in the Annotated Bibliography of Learning A Living, A Guide to Planning Your Career and Finding A Job for People with Learning Disabilities, Attention Deficit Disorder and Dyslexia)"
3,What?,"I do not know how this book is because my library does't ""agree with the language used in this book"". But what I can tell you is this: Billie Letts is a wonderful author, and if you want a really good book, read Where the Heart Is (by Billie Letts)."
5,you are not alone,This book makes you feel like your not alone in this. It has lots of info and experiences. This is a very very very well written book
4,Works well,"I used this paper to print labels for drinks and food at my wedding. After a test print on my inkjet printer, I ran water over the paper. Some extra ink was rinsed off, but the ink that had penetrated the paper didn't move. I am impressed."
5,Works as advertised.,"Works great with my HP inkjet. Be cautious when writing on this paper with a fine ball point pen, you can tear it. It is not tear proof paper."
3,Won't hold Canon Black ink,"Printed a color map with myCanon iP3600 Inkjet Photo Printer (2868B002). After a half hour, put a drop of water in the corner, and all the inks bled. After several hours, I tried again, and just the black bled, and maybe a tiny bit of green. Let it sit around 24 hours, and put the whole thing under running water - all the black bled off immediately. The colors seemed to stay strong though! The yellow, green, and blue look fine. there's a tiny bit of red on the map, and it looks a bit ragged, but it's still readable. The map doesn't look perfect, but it would be good enough to get home with, and it still feels robust and tear-resistant (see photos)."
1,DON'T BOTHER,"this paper STINKS! it is expensive; is not only not waterproof, it fades the colors and runs in the rain! don't waste your money like I did! if I could give this a zero star review I would but can't figure out how to submit this without giving at least 1 star (which it certainly does not merit!)"
1,Rip-off!!!,"Regrettably, Lerner has ""covered"" the impressive original research and intellectual synthesis of Ellen Leopold's book ""A Darker Ribbon: Breast Cancer, Women, and Their Doctors in the 20th Century."" Leopold's is the first book ever written on the social history of the radical mastectomy and breast cancer in this century, including previously unpublished correspondence and new information. Lerner makes a passing reference to Leopold's book, mistakenly dismissing her as a ""journalist"" and ""radical feminist."" Neither appellation is accurate. She is an architect and economic historian. Alas, she is not an M.D. For readers who want the insights of the intelligent female discoverer of this 20th century terrain rather than the sanitized medical perspective, I recommend ""A Darker Ribbon."""
2,without even seeing this I wouldn't buy it,"Being there last year I give this a big thumbs down. I am sure some of the footage would be good but there are so many better and more popular artists then some of the ones that were picked. I know its hard to pack in all the great music from the weekend into 2 discs but it's missing Bob dylan, String Cheese, Yonder Mountain String band, Umphrey Mcgee etc... By far this looks like the weakest of the 3 dvds. Buy the First year instead"
1,The Original Story Gets Lost in the Telling,"In an attempt to make this story more modern and relevant, the author/composer destroyed the original story beyond recognition. It is no longer a Brothers Grimm story. And the musical arrangements do a great job of concealing the talent of Diana Damrau and her beautiful voice. We only watched about a third of it before turning it off. We love Diana Damrau; but, this production is one she should have refused to do, as it does little to show off her rare musical talent. Do a You Tube search for her and you will hear her true ability as she does the Magic Flute. This production is more like a Broadway play than an Opera; and, a poor one at that. If you like the original Brothers Grimm story, if you like Diana, and if you like Opera, then you will not want to buy this DVD."
5,The 'Queen' of Israeli Popular Music,"Shoshana Damari who passed away in 2006 was the acknowledged 'Queen of Israeli popular music'. For six decades she inspired, and entertained the people of Israel. During the Israeli War of Independence she was a source of cheer and hope to the embattled population of the Yishuv. She had many great hits through the years but her signature song is the beautiful 'Kalaniyot'.Her voice was rich and throaty but bell-like in its clarity. She was the kind of singer who sang the lyrics with full feeling for the words. She worked with all the great Israeli songwriters but was especially close to Moshe Wilensky.This is a beautiful collection of her outstanding songs."
3,A good history of wages and price control,"The book is very interesting and clear in how it states the problems seen throughout history when the government tried to fabricate a parallel reality and solve problem by just saying they shouldn't exist. The book clearly states how wage and price control was applied in different parts of the world in different times in order to solve some sort of shortage or inflation problem.What the book lacks is a deeper review of the ways used to apply the controls and how exactly it under performed to solve the problems. In some cases it is due the lack of information from very old scenarios and in other cases I think the authors tried to keep it simple enough to be readable.The book is old and if you are looking for recent information, you won't find it.In general, a very interesting and insightful book about a topic not yet understood by a lot of people and governments (e.g. Argentina)"
3,Boot is sized weird,"When the wife tried on the frye campus boot (size 8.5), the foot part of the boot was much bigger than her other frye boots and the calf of these boots was cut super small. She's into the whole robin hood thing of tucking her jeans into her shoes these days and she can barely get her naked leg into this boot, let alone leg+jeans. They had to be returned for another style boot. I liked they were some of the old skool made in USA Fryes, but they cost too much to keep if they aren't comfortable."
4,frye campus boot,I love the boot but they did take some time to break in. I found they run a 1/2 size big. I usually wear a size 8- I ended up having to return the 8 for a 7.5.
2,Deborah,"First of all, it took longer to receive this order than ones I have placed before. It was shipped USPS. When previous purchases were shipped UPS, i received them quicker. When I received the boots they were not the quality I expected. They bunched around the ankles, and the leather was cheap looking. What aggravated me the most was when I returned them, $10.98 was deducted from the purchase amount, not the $6.00 they stated it would be. I am going to order from another site from now on. There are those that offer free return shipping. They will get my business from now on, not Amazon.^^^After explaining my grievance, a customer service representative refunded my return shipping cost and I am satisfied!"
2,Less than 18 Minutes of Music - Are you Kidding Me??,"This is a supreme ripoff. Seventeen minutes and forty-seven seconds of music for $9.49. The music itself is very good, especially the virtuosic adaptation of ""Flight of the Bumblebee."" This is the only reason I gave it two stars instead of one. Bottom line, there should be two or three times as much music on this CD to make it a worthwhile buy."
4,"YEAH, I FINISHED IT!!","Labor of love indeed, I finally finished this book. 1,492 pages of dense text. It took me 4 months.The book is in serious need of editing: Mann repeats himself often, and not always to good effect.But that said, I kept reading it for a reason: It's good.I can honestly say that I have never read a book using the voice that Mann employed here: Pedantic yet charming, it feels like you are being told a story by a kind hearted professor who sometimes rambles and repeats himself.Of the books by Mann that I have read, this is my favorite, followed by Faustus."
5,"Unsurpassed fiction, in any century","Anyone who has read my Listmania ""Escape Mass Market Fiction"" knows that I touted this novel (tertrology actually) as having "".... the most exquisite language since Shakespeare"". But it is truly beyond that. After 30 years and over 3,000 books read I can affirm that there simply has been no greater work of fiction produced in any century by man or woman. One of the reviewers below was dead-on saying you keep wanting to go back and reread the last 20 pages you managed to finish just to savor the experience. Original editions are a little rare and expensive, but, like any treasure, it's rewards are transcendental, and once read, you can consider yourself part of the most esoteric world of the true literati. NOTE-- Beginners who are easily scared off and prefer to sample first might want to skip the Preludes and go straight to the main chapters."
1,Charles Kuralt is a bore,"Several months ago, I purchased a set of the Winnie-the-Pooh stories narrated by Peter Dennis on tape. Not being able to find these on CD I purchased this CD narrated by Charles Kuralt. What a disappointment! He reads the stories with almost no inflection and absolutely no changes in character voices. If you want a really great rendition of these wonderfully funny and witty stories, seek out the ones narrated by Peter Dennis. Charles Kuralt was better at the news, with adults. Yawn!"
4,Splendid sophomore release,"Ignore the editoral at the top of this page, this is 16b's second release, but don't even bother trying to find Sounds From Another Room, or his first singele, Voices In The Sky. That being said, the two albums blend incredibly well, and would make excellent back-to-back random playing CDs in a cd changer, but staying foucused on How to Live 100 Years...16B uses nearly 100 % vintage equiptment, for creating sounds. That's why this is as melodic and organic as an early 808 State record. The vocal tracks are well executed, and add a little sexyness to the overall track selection...I have a feeling this CD would play well with the Neverending Story on mute. I'd have to call this dreamy, deep tech-house...Production work is splendid and is somewhat reminicent of Arihl Brika or John Tejada, guys who have a similar, reverberant-but-sparse house sound"
5,"How to Hear 10,000 Sounds","Omid Nourizadeh is a master of sounds! Each song has so much going on, but it all blends into a wondrous whole. The production is excellent with top flight musicianship. Unlike some of his other work, there are a number of vocal cuts here. Those who enjoyed his earlier sounds such as ""A moment to stop,"" ""TR mood,"" or ""Falling"" will want to add this to their collections. It's house music with brains, but it's moving as well and contemplative at times. I mean this as a high compliment. As for the songs, ""De-org song"" is great. It builds and changes with deep bass bubbling underneath synth-strings and syncopated beats - a hint of a Brazilian feel to this. ""Doubt"" is classic house music, again with groovy bass. ""The room"" borders on being full throttle techno. ""Virus"" is a vocal track that brings a smile to my face. A couple of shorter ambient tunes fill out the mix. I thoroughly enjoy this album."
3,"nice production, few melodies, unmemorable, but nice ""wallpaper""","I heard 16B's remix of a Natasha Atlas' song and it was phenomenal!Deep, melodic, spacious.How to Live 100 Years, HOWEVER, has the same production values,but is pretty shallow and has no hooky melodies."
3,Is the remote sticky to your touch?,"The back of this remote is rubberized, it feals sticky all of the time and looks like it is full of grease from being handled, I can't believe more of the reviewers haven't mentioned this?"
2,Easily Broken Charging Cradle Makes the Remote Useless,"I bought this a little over a year ago. I've always had problems with the charging cradle. I would have to really jimmy the remote in the right way to get it to charge. Recently, it just stopped charging. There is no way to charge the battery other than using the cradle, so the remote is completely broken. There is no way to buy a replacement cradle, and the device is out of warranty. I really liked it when it did work, but a one year life span is just not acceptable. Keep that in mind when buying other Logitech Harmony remotes with charging cradles. I did a little research and have found that the charging cradles have poor performance across all their remotes."
4,Can't go wrong!,"I've had my Logitech Harmony 720 remote for about 2 months and so far I don't have any major complaints. It was very easy to program. The only complaints I have is I sure wish the buttons were a little bit bigger and at this price it should be RF instead of IF. It replaced 4 remotes, that sure makes the coffee table look a lot less cluttered!"
1,Worst Program ever,"i got high hope from Logitech.but after i installed the software, and start it up.my god, worst programing ever.first im a savvy computer user,but you need to be a genius to setup this remote right.even worst, i need to add each my devices every time.come on, i dont even remember my cellphone number.what do you think i remember my device models."
2,"Compared to the 880, it's a dog","The one thing I like about this remote is the rubberized back and many of the buttons. I also have the 880, which I use in my family room. The 720 is for the bedroom.The 880 works virtually flawlessly, turning the components (TiVo, Samsung TV, Harmon Kardon receiver) on and to the correct setting. The 720, which has good sight lines for the IR, fails on something (Yamaha soundbar, Aquos TV, TiVo) about 90% of the time. I go through the Help button and it then turns on the sound or the TV, but it's really annoying. I would have sent it back, but had setup problems with the Aquos and it's way of treating inputs, that by the time I was done with technical support, my 30 days were up. I wish I had bought a refurb 880 instead.P.S. Never deal with Logitech through Email support. I've had to so so both with remotes and with my Logitech diNovo Mac Edition keyboard (see my review there)and to say it's awful is to give undue credit. Telephone support is much, much better."
2,Logitech Harmony 720 and Charger,"I gave up, and threw this in the trash.This 720 is a so-so remote. Nothing extraordinary. The BIG PROBLEM with it? The charging system. This was nothing but trouble from day one. Logitech replaced the charging base once, and that one failed as well. The remote just doesn't connect well with the contacts in the base so that it can charge. This was a constant aggravation. I can still hear the beep beep beep as they contacts try and make a good connection for the charging to occur.My advise? Avoid this one."
3,Not the little brother of the Harmony One,"Bought this remote for the upstairs, because I liked the Harmoy One quite a bit. I should have paid closer attention. The 720 is not touch screen (which I knew), and the keypad is laid out completely different (which I should have noticed). Difficult to navigate in the dark (though the screen is bright enough to light up the entire room), it's difficult to see the key labels. Scroll keys on left and right, the One has them in center, Guide and Menu keys are opposite sides of 720 vs the One. All silent keys would be nice also, most have an audible click, the ones above the <^> select button are silent, nicer for navigating when wife is asleep. Not a bad remote at all, just little continuity between products."
5,Great Remote,"Great remote! I have been using the Harmony 880 the past 4 years until it was dropped 1 too many times. I charged the bettery of this remote. I then plugged it in to the the computer, and had the Harmoney program transfer the settings to the my 720 and in 15 minutes it was ready to use!"
4,logiteck rocks for us,We love it! Very easy set-up and function.I would recommend this if you have multiable componants to work with.
5,Where have you been all my life?,"I bought this remote yesterday. When setting up my home theater system that I'd stored several years ago, I could no longer locate the remote controls for my components. After several non productive calls to Onkyo I decided to give the Logitech remote a try, hoping that they would have the correct codes to run my system. After I ran the easy to use software, the remote works much better than I had hoped. It's smart enough to set up all of your activities such as turn on TV, Sound System and DVD with the push of one button. I have no hesitation in recommending thisfine product With the docking station the days of dead batteries and a table crowded with a collection of remotes are over!"
5,Finally a universal remote that really works!,"Absolutely the best in universal remotes. I have tried so many of them and always had to go back to using 2 or more of the original remotes because setting the codes never seemed to work. With this remote, the setup is very easy on the computer and works like a charm. Even if the remote doesn't turn all the components on, just push the help button and it asks questions until everything is set up like you want it. I love the charging feature instead of using batteries as I can place the remote on the charger overnight and be ready the next day. This is a very good product and one I would highly recommend."
5,great remote!,"I upgraded from a logitech 550 , and glad I did, the 720 operates much better and my wife also loves it, with screen, you cant go wrong. A little sticky when unpacked though, just carefully cleaned with alcohol and soft cloth."
3,It's a good remote,"It has arrow buttons that allow you to scan though the custom button pages either direction. The battery lasts a long time between charges; I sometimes don't put it on the charging base but once every couple weeks. It works well and is easy to use and setup. My biggest complaints are: it's hard to get the remote set on the charging base just right, so that the contacts touch and it charges. I have to play with it for several minutes some times. It only has 6 custom buttons per page, where as my newer 880 has 8 and the spaces between them are greater so easier to see. For the same money, I'd go for the referb 880, but for a new remote, this is a good remote and worth the money."
3,captured,"this is a cozy film, which i watched to practice my spanish, although it is not only in spanish, but also english, so you get both. If you are looking for a literary review or comparison between these two writers or you want some sort of realistic history, this is not the movie for you. If you want a quiet romantic comedy for a lazy saturday afternoon, and you don't mind a subtitle or two; Go with this!i just did this review because i watched this movie a couple of months ago, was not disappointed by it, and kinda sad to see no reviews yet. I've actually thought about renting it again."
4,It's brilliant.,"I was amazed to find his knowledge of India, the film industry and the politics of the streets so authentic. The story is like an off-line movie story while hovering around the film industry itself. I've read Clive James's other books but none touched me so much as this. Read it!"
3,Not his best,"Clive James' best novel is probably the third book of his autobiographical trilogy. If you want to laugh out loud, I'd recommend ""Brilliant Creatures"". ""The Silver Castle"" is funny, but I feel that Clive should stick to writing about Australia or the UK. When I read the book, I was left with the impression that he doesn't know India that well."
4,Worth Reading,This was a good book. Characters are interesting and the scenes in Provincetown are truly believable.Makes you want to head out to P-Town!
5,Romance is alive,"When I read the reviews for this book I decided that I would purchase it. I also, at the same time, purchased the rest of the books in this particular series (and some of her others too). I AM HOOKED!The sexual tension between the characters is quite strong. As the plot unfolds the reader is drawn more and more into the story, hoping that Reese, the ""strong and silent type"" and Dr Tory King, the wounded but strongminded town doctor, will realize who they are to each other, and to the town.I loved this book, and couldn't put it down. You will too."
3,"""Are we there yet?""","Even though I like James Herbert, I am glad this was not my first book by him, or I probably would not have gone on to read his other works. This book is very, very slow going. A previous reviewer's description ""like slogging through mud"" is very appropriate. Not much of anything happens until the very end. Some could say he spent his time developing his characters or building suspense. What little attempts at suspense building that are even deployed are ruined by comments to the effect of ""if I had only known...."" The ending was decent, it just took too long to get there. ""Are we there yet?"""
2,Not what I expected,"I bought the Raggtopp product based on the manufacturer recommended rating same as the other 2 reviews I just read. I applied 3 coats, emptying the can. on the top of my Mini Cooper convertible as I had bought the car used and there was no water beading. I cleaned the top per their instructions beforehand using Raggtopp cleaner. When done I could see some beading for a week or so then none. Time to try the 303 product. All I got was a clean top and a little beading on the side."
2,Container did not function properly.,"gave it two stars because the cleaner proved to be a superb product. Unable to assess the quality of the protectant because the container did not work, when the spray head was depressed only a little foam was produced. Did not notify company because I am just fed up with stuff that does not function as advertised.Purchased 303 High Tech Fabric Guard, will see how it works."
1,0 STARS: These movies are worse than the original.,"These movies are just total nonsensical rubbish about mutated babies. There is nothing scary or horrifying about any of these movies, silly, maybe, but not scary. From a horror movie fan's perspective, I remain completely unimpressed with the merits of these films and that includes the original, ""It's Alive"" which is not even offered in this set. I was just completely bored with these movies. The first one is definitely the lesser of the evils, but not much as far as being a scary movie or even an entertaining one for that matter...the movies you get in this package are much worse than the original. What a worthless...waste. The only thing about babies (mutated or not) that scares me is having to change their diapers. Don't waste your money here!!"
4,Creative ideas for today's overworked Moms,"Stay-at-home and working moms often feel stressed about house chores, their spouse and their children. If you're a stressed-out mom and are feeling disconnected from your role of wife and mother, it's time to rearrange your priorities and focus on what's most important in your life.""...To Love, Honor, and Vacuum,"" by Sheila Wray Gregoire, is just the book to help stressed-out moms learn how to improve their lives. It gives many examples, helpful tips and ideas, includes things to think about, and provides checklists to help manage your stressful life.MyParenTime.com recommends this book -- although the book contains Christian-based ideas, this book is appropriate for Moms of all faiths. ""When you feel more like a maid than a wife and mother,"" the suggestions in this book can help you change that :)."
1,not an authorized dealer!!,"5 year gurantee? what about the warranty from Tag Heuer, it doesn't come with it b/c it is being purchased from an unauthorized dealer, these watches come form who knows where, why do you think there are only 2 to choose from instead of the entire line of watches? by the way, Tag Heuer will not work on these watches since it was bought here."
5,Thumbs up,I loved this colection! Especialy since I missed the beginning of season 4. Can't wait for the others.
1,stay away,"Beware the ""word collection"" as you only get 5 episodes ...Video quality - if you are playing on a old tube TV great ... otherwise ""Horrible""You can purchase the entire season for about the same price with proper dvd quality."
5,A must-have for saxophone enthusiasts!!!,"I was first introduce to the 29th Street Saxophone quartet 5 years ago and ever since then I've been hooked. This album is not for the faint of heart, though. This band, composed of strictly saxophones (bari, tenor, and two altos) is not like your usual jazz band. They rock out with a crazy and unorthodox style that is one of a kind. They combine techniques such as altissimo register and mega-riffs that make you want to listen to them for hours. I feel that this album is a must-have for any saxophone enthusiast!!! Take a listen and I'm sure you'll feel the same way!!"
3,Yuck!!!,"This is a product that could have used some instructions. The liquid was more of a gel than a liquid. While it produced some good bubbles, it needed to be watered down first, by a ""hit or miss"" method."
4,A Superb Account of Stuart's Cavalry,"In his personal narrative of his time spent with General JEB Stuart during the Civil War, Heros von Borcke gives the reader excellent insights into the war from the Cavalry rider's point of view. Additional background knowledge of certain battles does prove helpful has Heros does not always give a clear description of battle or the lay of the land. Maps would also aid greatly when he speaks of riding from town to town. Overall, the book was well worth the read. His vantage point enables him to faithfully detail to the reader an accurate picture of General JEB Stuart which makes the read quite intriguing. Borcke places the reader in middle of major battles and brings him along on his daring expeditions with Stuart. He gives his account of the war vividly and memorably, inserting those things that must have been mundane to him like the humor of others and the weather conditions."
2,Bon Borcke's Memoirs,"This book is no doubt good, but it is scanned in, and is barely readable. Words like General Rodes, read Fenaral Eodes, and it is not interesting to read that way. Chapter titles are crammed in where they should not be. The table of contents is simarily unreadable."
1,Total Gimmick!,"Do yourself a favor and stay away from these plugs. I used them for a few months in my 02' Camaro when suddenly I noticed some sputtering and heavy hesitation, especially when the engine was cold. I checked the plugs and sure enough, two of them had severe gap erosion. I never even noted any gas mileage improvement. Not to mention these plugs are MADE IN CHINA! There is no substitute for good old fashion conventional design plugs. They've been in use for over 70 years after all."
5,Unreal spark plugs,"Since trying these in my truck I have ended up installing them in everything I have that has spark plugs! Not only do the work great in pick-ups, cars, and SUV's but they also shine in boats and lawn equipment. My 19 foot runabout with a 165hp inboard MercCruiser engine has never run so good and the 30hp Johnson outboard on my smaller boat pull starts easier than ever. E3 plugs will be in all of my engines from now on!"
2,Makea Feet Look Really Flat,"I bought these shoes because they had really good reviews and I wanted some flat sling backs. But, when I got them I was disappointed because they made my feet look really (strangely) flat.(I mean I know they are flats, and I usually like that, but these shoes are REALLY flat) I don't know if anyone else has had this problem, I just thought I should let people know so they don't have to buy them and return them like I did."
3,Shoe purchase,"Didn't receive the first order, but Amazon was very quick in responding and sending a replacement order. The shoes looked great, just as they were pictured, but the fit could be better."
4,Part 2 of 2 IMO,"When I had listened to 'the Greater Wrong of the Right' quite a few times it seem that it was missing something (besides Dwayne, may he rest in peace). It was an amazing album but it just seemed incomplete. After I had received 'Mythmaker' This album seemed to make up for what their previous album was missing. To me it seemed that these two albums should really be one. They complement each other, with the reminiscent Skinny Puppy which is easily apparent in the song in 'Dal.' If your not familiar with Skinny Puppy at all I would suggest you listen to 'The Greater Wrong of the Right' to ease you in. This album is very OhGr'ish and is unbound by conventional music laws that you'll find in their earlier albums, which may dart away a first time listener."
2,teenage angst,I dont know what happened to good old skinny puppy. It sounds more like an angsty teenage album from a no-name band. I was so excited by the reunion of Key and Ogre. Greater Wrong of the Right was a great comeback showing how the band had evolved since their seperation. This CD leaves me scratching my head and wondering what the hell happened
2,Good for hardcore Skinny Puppy fans,"I like them quite a bit, but no song really captured my attention. Mediocre album. Disappointing."
1,You've got to be kidding me.,"This record is awful. Why these other reviewers compare it with ""the old days"" and then mention Last Rights and Too Dark Park is beyond my comprehension. Those albums are NOT THE OLD DAYS of Skinny Puppy ANYWAY! Bites, Remission, Mind the Perpetual Intercourse, those were great albums. I've listened to some of them hundreds of times I think. I'd say they must need the money, but I don't know that that's it and I don't want to insult them any further.....ANYWAY, this album sounds like a bunch of goofy rock songs to me. Just really bad rock songs. I hated it. What happened to these guys? DEPRESSING!!!"
1,The vanguard becomes the rear-guard,"The innovative techniques that made SKINNY PUPPY sound edgy and subversive twenty years ago now sound tired and lo-tech. Clearly, times have changed. The average listener is more sophisticated, having been bombarded with new-wave, techno and trip-hop all within the space of a decade. But the passage of time seems to have had little effect on SKINNY PUPPY, at least if this album is anything to judge by. SKINNY PUPPY was fun to listen to. You could even dance to some of it. The early albums were fun; they were sinister with a hint of camp, like the dopey thrill of watching horror flicks with friends while getting high. The thrill is gone."
2,What the hell?,"the only thing this album has going for it is its sleeve design. I have loved every skinny puppy release, even the process and gwotr. but i am really at a loss with this album. every track reminds me of yanni new age synth music with ogre doing his cher effects. and then there are these really cheesy repititious melodies. ""jesus wants to be ugly. jesus wants to be ugly"".. so annoying.remember when listening to a skinny puppy album was like being forced to watch a freaky snuff film or horror movie? this album is like watching one of those ghost hunter shows on tv... lots of annoying gadgets and you never get to see a ghost.godd*mn i really wanted to like this album."
1,RIP Skinny Puppy!,"This album sucks! But if you are a puppy fan, you are going to buy it anyway...and only listen to it every now and then too make sure it is really as awful as you thought it was!As the title of my review indicates, as far as I'm concerned...Skinny Puppy is dead! I will still listen to 'bites/remission' thru 'too dark park' every day, but this and 'TGWOTR'are not going anywhere near my stereos! When I first Heard them in the early 80's, I could not believe what I was hearing! They were such incredible musicians making a music that has never been duplicated by anybody!If they want to make music like this...fine...just do NOT call it Skinny Puppy!!! give it another name!Since when has rhyming become so important anyway! It actually sounds kinda silly!"
4,c.moore,"For those of you longing for the 80s and 90s, Ogre has left the building. What emerged was ohGr, a much faster, more versatile and melodic vocalist - with the same dark and playful lyrics. The dog has left home and following ohGr in the direction of Welt and Sunny...and that's better than where most mythmakers (nin, mm) are going. And yes, there are duds on most albums, and so we can forgive some songs for being Ugli (it might be more impressive to sing about other religious figures...but that might be dangerous). All in all, it's a great CD..."
5,A Great Little Tool,"Zippos are the best lighters by far. They're really reliable and i've never had one break on me. Even if it did, there's a lifetime warranty so i wouldn't need to worry about it. There isn't really much to say about this other than you can't beat it. Especially for $10."
3,ehhh,"works well at times, and works like crap at others. like i would fill it up and a day later it wont light. so i gotta fill it up again."
3,"works as expected, fluid gasses escape after a few weeks","I don't use this often but when I do (twice a month) I have to refill the darn thing with fluid, which is normal but not worth having for light users of lighters."
5,street chrome Zippo lighter,"the product was great but i could have used some informaton about dementions of the lighter and weather or not it came with the flint and wicks. other than that, this is a great investment and im proud to own a zippo."
2,broken flints,Is it normal for the flints to break off a small piece after only 4 or 5 weeks of use? This is my first Zippo and in under three months I have gone through replacing three flints. I am the only user and light it about 20 times a day. If this is not normal flint usuage I will be sending it back for replair. Also the wheel will be working just fine and then it will bind up.
4,The only Downside...,I have recently purchased a Zippo lighter from Amazon.com. The only complaint i have about said lighter is it comes with no fuel. Please be sure to buy yourself some zippo lighter fuel or any lighter fuel will work. However DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES use Butane or Gasoline for u could damage your zippo and possibly injure yourself.
1,Not as described,"My search for a lighter included the terms butane and refillable. And this lighter's description included this phrase: ""Uses butane fuel (sold separately)"" Unfortunately the lighter I received was NOT a butane lighter and had a wick and instructions on how to fill with lighter fluid. Looks like I received the correct lighter but the description is wrong. Too bad as it is a nice looking and feeling lighter but if you are looking for a butane lighter, this is not the right one."
1,horrible,i bought htis gift for my boyfriend for valentine's day and it was horrible! it didnt even work and was strached up compeltley ! DONT BUY THIS PRODUCT!
1,not cool!!!!!! D:,when i got it i was so excited then i found out i had to buy feul it still wouldnt satrt now i realized the flint didnt come with it......false advertisment 1 star :O
1,Why not call it what it is....cancer helper?,Disappointed that Amazon would sell an aid to cancer. What relly bothers me is that you smokers will ultimately come down with a smoking related disease and expect us to pay for it. Keep on smoking....it helps with overpopulation.
5,good,"It is a real zippo. I love it, It is useful and cheap. I will give my friend as a good gift. So I think it is value for money."
5,"its a zippo, what more could u want","i do find the felt a bit harder to lift up to fill than my other zippo, but its not a big deal. also, the finish is very scratched looking, makes it look more used, i like it, doesnt show wear and tear as much. for thhose of you who dont like it its a zippo, know what your getting, the method of it goes back for like 80 years, its how lighters all used to be. also, changing the wick in this piece is really flippin annoying"
5,Good Lighter,I love this lighter. it light my cigars without a problem. Only thing is you have to buy the butane separately. I reccoment going to a store and getting the fluid cause shipping is ridiculous on line. i paid over $6 for the fluid. Dumb move on my part. i do recommend this lighter. $9 and it will last a long time. Can't beat a Zippo!
2,ehh,it worked for about a week then it broke i replaced wick filled it but the flint wheel would not make any sparks
5,Awesome.,One awesome product. The original thing. NOTE THAT THIS DOES NOT COME WITH THE LIGHTER FLUID. So make sure u purchase the lighter fluid together with this. Came in on time.
4,Love it!,"I bought this for my boyfriend after the other personalized one was stolen. (it was a one of a kind wiley e coyote pic on it) For the price of this engraved Zippo it really is a great deal! Someone will look pretty dumb holding a zippo saying, 'this zippo belongs to Stanley XXXX III, the best ever dad, boyfriend, and friend.' He loves it!"
4,Zippo,"I think I lost my Zippo last week when I went out to blow up some fireworks, but I love this thing! It runs out of fuel if you just let it sit for awhile though... But other than that, this thing is great! I bought this thing mainly because it's a classic that I believe everyone should have, and it is windproof."
4,Decent,"the lighter's alright. it came as advertised. just make sure you have flints and lighter fluid ready cause without them the lighter's useless. would've gave it 5 stars but the fluid evaporates rather quickly and needs to be refilled almost weekly, especially if you use it often."
3,"Lights well, fluid evaporates in ~week","The lighter chimney operates well, the case is nice. However, the closed lighter does not have a good seal - the zippo fluid evaporates out of the closed lighter after a period of about a week, requiring regular refill, which is a hassle."
2,Product has scratches,Many scratches on the product. Looks like it has been thrown around (not just used - and this is a brand new piece). Maybe a display piece - can't be too sure. Its just too low a price for me to bother sending it back. Not happy. Not what one associates with the Zippo brand.
3,I WANTED TO GIVE YOU FIVE STARS SO BAD :( but........,"2 MAJOR let downs is that the flint wheel amazingly hard to pull at times, and the hinges on them ( I bought 2 ) are pretty wobbly. It also did not arrive on time. besides that the lighters are great!"
3,good Zippo,"This is a good dependable lighter. I wouldn't expect anything else from Zippo. It's not their best, but its pretty good for the price."
1,Save yourself the headache and buy a disposable lighter,I've bought two of these and the both quit working after a couple months. They eat through the fluid and need refilled constantly. Terrible product.
2,Good while it lasted..,I really liked this lighter because it didn't go out when it was windy but I only used it a couple times and now it won't spark at all it's probably the flint but it seems like too much of a hassle to use this lighter ill stick with the cheap plastic ones
5,sweet lighter,"Best price I have ever found a nice looking real Zippo lighter, and it has a nice weight too. It holds about the same amount of fluid as a more expensive Zippo, and it's so pretty!"
4,Love this lighter,"This lighters moderate size proves to fit comfortably into your pocket. It holds it's fuel in very well and is fun just to flip open and play with. It's also a great price for a Zippo. The only thing I dislike about it is that it doesn't look a lot like in the picture, but instead looks used with its outer shell scratched (which is what street crome means I guesse)."
3,Cool Lighter,"Zippo lighters are still the coolest lighters...its just not very practical because you constantly have to re-fuel it, which is a pain. Also, if you dont use it for a while the fuel dries up."
5,Great Product,"Great product. Everything came one time and in one piece. Case was a bit dented, but no real problems. Overall a great buy."
4,Great Lighter,"Great, cheap lighter. The finish isn't the nicest, but it's good because you don't have to worry about scratches or it getting tossed around a bit. The hinge on my is just a tad loose, though."
3,My knockoff zippo is better manufactured.,"The hinge is loose, and the metal catch inside the lid was bent out too far. I bought this to replace a Chinese-made imitation zippo, and the imitation was made better."
1,Lighter fluid evaporates,"I don't assume this is unique to zippo lighters, but the fluid evaporates extremely quickly if you don't use it. If you're not going to be carrying this around in your pocket, get a 99 cent bic lighter. If you are going to be carrying a lighter around then it's still easier to just buy disposable lighters."
2,Don't Count On It Working,"I'm not a smoker, so I bought the Zippo lighter for outdoor camping-type situations. The good news: it seems sturdy and the striker always creates a spark. The bad news: to make it work you have to fill it manually with lighter fluid. Then, within a couple of weeks, regardless of how you store it, the fluid evaporates, leaving you with a useless lump of metal. This is not really what I want to discover when I'm out in the field trying to light a fire... So if you are a smoker and will only use this at home and are prepared to re-fill the device every week, it will work fine for you. But if you need a reliable source of flame in more general circumstances, this is totally worthless and you should go for storm-proof matches and/or a cheap disposable plastic lighter because those somehow manage to retain their fluid reliably for years, instead of letting it evaporate over night."
2,Helpful Hints before You Buy,"*Doesn't work out of box* This is a good quality product with a great guarantee behind it; however, no where on the description does it say you need to buy the fluid separate. The lighter comes with no fluid with it nor do they tell you to buy it with the lighter which makes it frustrating when you receive it then can't light it. So overall i like the product just don't forget to buy the fluid"
3,Looks good but didn't work when I received it,"I like the finish, but I didn't know that it wouldn't come in with any lighter fluid in it. Or it's just the one I got that has this problem?Anyhow, I just ordered their lighter fluid for it, and it works great."
2,Display zippo,"I got a display zippo....covered in scratches from top to bottom front and back. 1 star gone.This of course means the lighter didnt click as sharply as a new one should, which made was another star deduction.Lastly it was not advertised to be a display zippo, it was displayed to be NEW. As a result of false advertisement, another star.If the company would give me back my 10 $ and pay for shipping i would return it.Sadly thats not the case."
1,Waste of Money,"Having just passed my CCA Certification, I was looking for a review book for the next step, the CCS-P Certification. Having used PRG's review books (for the CCA and CCS), I was looking for something else to study from. This book is truly a waste of time and money. Pitifully basic, this book would not even be a good study book for the CCA exam. Most of the information reviewed was basic and not advanced enough to help for the difficulty level of the CCS-P. Specific number of pages and information present is woefully inadequate. I would recommend the PRG books 100% of the time, they actually do prepare you for the certification exams. I was shocked to see Carol Buck's name on it as I have studied from her coding textbook and it was thorough and well put together. I hope this saves you from wasting your money."
1,"Endorsed CEU's,per book cover/ NONE FOUND","I was under the impression that there would be CEU's given for studying this review book, as they are endorsed by the AAPC logo on the front of the book. There were none. It came in a plastic wrap, but listed as used. Has someone already used this book and taken out the CEU certificate? I would like to return it as I would rather order somthing to receive the CEU's also. Thanks. The shipping was very prompt."
3,One of Many Perspectives,"This book was written from one person's perspective, albeit a personal aid to Sinatra, and does offer interesting insight into Frank's personality, disposition and day-to-day life. Some of language, subjects, and activities described in this book are too explicit for my personal taste and can't say I read every paragraph line for line because of this. One quickly learns the activities Frank was involved in with and adding the colorful, coarse details actually degrades the overall quality of the book.The book does go into a fair amount of detail on his relationships with other well known people and families (the Kennedy's, for example). I did find this to be very informative.One cannot rely on any single book to provide the net sum of a persons life. This book should be read as such. However, Mr. S did provide an interesting read that should be added to other sources of information on Frank Sinatra and taken only as one perspective of the man's life."
3,Mr. S,"mr. s is full of gossip but after reading it, i can only have pity for who sinatra was as a person and pity for his miserable life tr"
1,meanly-written book,Do not believe in the good memories of the servants who their masters kicked out. It seems the main care of George Jacobs were peeping through the keyhole of the bedroom for the sex life of his master. And I doubt details of the events were described by the servant who was unlikely to have witnessed all it. Before Jacobs shared his fantasies with Kitty Kelley. Then he waited for his master died so Sinatra cannot sue him for libel and received his share in order to cash in on passing of the great singer. This meanly and badly written book is ideal for the crowd who love to savor the gossip and rumors about the private lives of the great people.
4,Amazing Document of Cultural History,"I didn't have high expectations for this book. The British royal family has shown us that tell-alls by ""valets"" and the like leave much to be desired, but this book was a wonderful surprise. It serves not only as an unusual insight into an American icon -- Frank Sinatra -- but also a cultural history of a young black man, George Jacobs, coming of age in the 1950's and 1960's with a front row seat on some of the most important figures of our time from Joe Kennedy to Ava Gardner to Sammy Davis, Jr. I think this book gives provocative insight on our American history through the lens of race, gender and popular culture."
4,"From Bedroom to Board Room, He Was Larger Than Life","""Mr. S: My Life with Frank Sinatra,"" by his valet of 15 years George Jacobs (whom Sinatra fired for dancing with Mia Farrow), is filled with enough vanity, insecurity, envy, racism, drinking, smoking, womanizing and deal-making for three lifetimes. Jacobs takes the reader into the ""board room"" and the bedroom to reveal intimate portraits of the supremely talented larger-than-life Chairman himself, the woman he never stopped loving (Ava Gardner), mobster associates like one-time Al Capone ""wheel man"" Sam Giancana, that pitiful plaything of the rich and famous, Marilyn Monroe, and the utterly vile Kennedy father (who was even ""crueler about Jews than he was about blacks"") and his charismatic, whore-mongering son (drinking, drugs and round-the-clock sex that had even the insatiable Sinatra panting).If Ronald Reagan's motto was ""Win one for the Gipper,"" JFK's (and Sinatra's) surely had to be ""Win one for the zipper."""
4,bright,The switch is much brighter than previous products I have used in the past. Really easy to install.
4,Very good film with very good Epic + unusual score!,"Mysterius, epic and full of ""sonic"" glory soundtrack!Unusual and very mysterius film atmosphere, with very good music.The score ""matches"" excellent with the film.Very good composer.Is it an ""action"" film? Yes, there is plenty of action!If you like chinese scores with epic music-""structure"", this one will not disappoint you as well.Number 7 is a Holy number!The 7 swords film + the soundtrack aren't Holy, that's for sure.... but both DVD + CD is a must for your music and video collection!"
2,Not for self-study!,"Please be aware that this book (and others by the same publisher)are meant for colleges and/or trade schools and thus the answers to exercises, labs, projects, etc are available ONLY to instructors. Furthermore, neither the publisher nor the authors maintain a website for errata so you are on your own if you misunderstand a concept due to typos and false information."
4,"Good, moderately Microsoft-focused, no Cisco","There's a lot in this book that is good. However, it's focused towards the future Microsoft server administrator, not the future router or switch maintainer. I'd suggest a CCNA-training book for that."
1,Terrible buy!,"I ordered this book for a class that I was enrolled in. When I received it, it was just thrown in a box that it hardly fit in. It had gotten all bent and torn."
2,disappointed,Too much fluff and too many factoids. I was hoping for more hard information detailed enough to setup networks.
4,Ghostly melody,"Oh my word... I found this out from a lover of mine, and I swear to you, you'll be humming it for ages. One of the most dramatic pieces I've heard for a long time... Needs to be bought ?"
4,Scathing yet smooth,"This date was recorded while Berg was trying to beat his addiction to heroin. All the tracks, including the 6th track, an ""unnamed"" solo version of ""in a sentimental mood"", are full of fire, energy and tension, as if you could see the convulsions of addiction turning within the artist himself. More of his recent recordings have been full of the same licks and Michael Brecker-ish playing, but this CD is a creative balance of bebop and late Coltrane-style music, if such a thing could ever exist.While Berg doesn't remember anything he played that night, you won't forget anything you hear if you pick up this disc. Prepare to be scared and serenaded by Berg's raw human emotions."
1,NOT RECOMMENDED,I don't recommend this book. This book is filled with examples with little explaination. I don't see this book as a very good reference. SO ITS NOT A COMPLETE REFERENCE. Should be called COMPLETE EXAMPLES.
5,A Great Code Rescource,Complete Reference is the right term. The code found in this book is invaluable and is a treasure trove of examples covering a wide range of topics.
2,Examples and more examples,"Don't expect to learn much using this book. However I will judge it as a reference and it is poor at that. The indexing is [bad] and, when you do get what you want, concepts are explained in a confusing manner, just a sea of abstractions. This person has little talent as a teacher. The good thing I can say is there are lots of examples (i.e breifly explained code and pictures) that might be useful to you (which I found learning ADO). Otherwise don't get this book unless you like to be frustrated and bored."
2,Didn't anybody proofread this thing?,"I cannot believe the number of basic errors in this book. It looks like the author wrote it from memory and didn't test it or even proofread it. You must rely on previous knowledge of VB to fill in the gaps. If you are a beginner, forget it."
1,Index Makes it next to useless,"I have found this book to be next to useless because of the poorly implemented index. As examples, ""Data Types"" and ""Call"" are not included in the Index. Programmers using Visual Basic need to have quick access to looking up data types and specific verbs. Without this, the reader is on his own to dig through the book and hopefully spot what he is looking for. I have gone to this book countless times and rarely find the subject matter I need in the index."
2,Not so complete reference,"No doubt, they have something useful for me. I found its contents quite incomplete though. In fact - I bought Wayne Freeze's ""Expert Guide to Visual Basic 6"" and it suites me better. I would not recommend this book to any one who have more than 3 years experience programming Visual Basic - but if you are new to VB E-commerce applications - check out the last 2 chapters. Almost tempted me to buy it before I found the other book."
2,Should not be considered a complete reference,I have found some of the code usefull in this book however I do not regard this book as a complete reference. It does not have a complete listing of objects and members
1,NOT WORTH THE MONEY,This book is difficult to read and the examples are hard to follow. At times the examples are not accurate and is missing information. It would be good for someone who like to spend hours trying to type code from the book and figure out what the book is missing to get it to work. my suggest is to save your money. There are much better books on VB6 which include code as well as being a good reference on objects
1,NOT A COMPLETE REFERENCE,I think the MS help files would be a better reference than this book. 3/4 of this book is code and has very little explanation of objects and very little definitions of terminology.
1,Disappointing for Pooh fans,"Pooh, Tigger and friends are generally adored by my children, but this small board book failed to capture their interest. The sturdy flaps reveal nothing of interest to inquisitive young minds. For example, rather than friendly ghouls, two lightening bolts hide behind one of the flaps. The flaps are difficult for toddlers to grasp. The text is awkward for both children and adults. It is the first Pooh book my children did not want to read again."
4,"bright warm colors, might be scary for some","This is a short book -- five rhyming verses, five lift-the-flaps. Piglet is scared of Halloween so he builds himself a ""spookable,"" a mechanical monster, to test his own mettle. He figures if he can handle he spookable he'll be able to handle whatever Halloween brings. The spookable is a scary-looking contraption. If your child can handle the somewhat scary drawings, they might work for the child just like they do for piglet."
2,Not as cool as I thought it would be,I took a gamble and bought this... and I found out it's not as cool as I thought it would be.I still use it... mostly out of guilt.
2,Sweet but not informative,"This is a very short and romantic description of life with alpacas but do not buy it with the hopes of getting any real information. It contains nothing. It was very cute but has mostly hand drawn sketches that fill the few pages it has with VERY few words on each page. I should have read the description before I bought it. I am not sorry to own it - it is a wonderful description of the relationship one can have with the animals just no information on their care, habits, or anything having to do with raising them."
1,Not what I expected at all.,"I should have read the description more closely - ""warm, fuzzy"" should have given it away. I was expecting some information about alpacas and instead got a children's story."
1,Children's book,Oops! I thought it would be informative - no. Maybe share it with the kindergarden class.
5,Well worth it!!!,This is a wonderful likeness and there are several accessories. The price is very reasonable. I am glad that I have added it to my collection!
2,Don't bother,Terrible voice casting for the lead male role made this boring anime if worse to watch but if u have time and nothing else to watch and can buy it cheap go for it
4,While The Second Set Gives A Little Closure There Is No Real Ending Here,"If you dislike the open ending on series that leave some if not most of the questions and situations unanswered or unresolved then this is a series you might want to pass over, while the series on whole is entertaining no real questions or truly answered nor or the conflicts really resolved but since the series follows the manga story that's to be expected. The series is a nice fantasy action series especially for those who like series like Sands Of Destruction or Tower Of Druaga but I'd advise getting the first set before this one for obvious reasons that you'll need to know who the characters are and what the situation and story behind the conflicts in the series. I do advise people try to watch a few episodes online just to be sure if this series is for them before they purchase the the sets..."
5,Simple words/great story,"I teach first grade and was looking for material for my small reading groups. This will be perfect. The author tells a cute story that I know my students will enjoy, using simple words, most of which they've learned by this point in the year (second quarter). Excellent illustrations are used to support the limited text. I just ordered 5 more copies. :)Sample pages:p.1 Jack and Jill and Big Dog Bill go up, up, up the hill.p. 7 At the top, they stop.p. 21 ""Oh, no,"" say Jack and Jill. ""Bill will not go!"""
5,One of the best early readers series!,"This was the first Step 1 book my daughter read (at the library, all by herself) and convinced me to purchase almost the entire set of books. These Step Into Reading books are excellent as they have a high-interest factor that motivates her to read. The stories are also wonderfully illustrated in full color, and being a visual learner, my daughter latched on to these books quickly.These Step 1 series are recommended for preschool-K - the stories are in large type and the vocabulary is easy. The stories are also in a rhyming format which makes them easy and fun to read. The full color pictures also provide contextual clues as to the word being used in the text. These early readers have raised my daughter's confidence level in reading, and she is doing so well that I'm purchasing the Step Two books (Preschool-Grade 1). I use these books in conjunction with sight words to reinforce her recognition of common vocabulary."
5,5 year old Daughter loves it,"My 5 year old girl, who is learning to read lives this book. She loves to read it in bed at night before falling asleep. Word repetitiveness is perfect for building her confidence. The story line is silly and fun. If the book survives, it will be perfect for my son in a few years, too."
1,It doesn't get warm!,"Not even a ""GENTLE warming sensation""; the warmth is absent completely! Not only does it not even get warm, but it comes in this teeny tiny bottle about as big as your thumb!!! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!! K-Y is usually a trusted brand but this doesn't do what the name CLEARLY states it does. What DOES work: K-Y Touch warming massage oil...I bought that a long time ago, lost it somewhere, but it DOES do what its supposed to and its a decent sized bottle."
3,Simple accurate basic definitions of psychological terms,"So far as I can tell the definitions in this work however brief are not so much wrong, but so brief as to miss out on the full meaning of the term.. Another shortcoming of the book is that it deals in 'terms and concepts' only, and does not touch upon personalities. There is not a word about Freud and his contribution to Psychology in this work. Many of the definitions are of broad medical terms and not specifically psychological ones."
3,This one is made in Indonesia and not in Germany,This one is made in Indonesia and not in Germany. I wander if it will chip as quickly (couple of month) as that Les Cruiset crap made in Thailand
1,Hate Them,"I received these sheets yesterday, washed them with fabric softner, and slept on them last night HORRIBLY. They were very stiff, stiff enough that I was freezing cold all night because they don't conform to your body. And on the two occasions when I was warm there was no breathing ability with these and I immediately began to sweat. Plus they were very itchy, it was like sleeping under a insulated piece of sand paper. I'm going to take them off and wash them SEVERAL more times today and see if this helps. If not I will never use them again!"
2,Get something else,"These sheets came out of the drier extremely wrinkled. I actually had to iron them afterwards. Save your money for something better.On the plus side, the fitted sheet is very deep. Most fitted sheets don't fit my bed, however these were too loose."
1,It was just food recipes. Nothing interesting at all.,"It is food recipes only, nothing about breaking into computers. Not that I would ever do such a thing, I am a law abiding citizen that really loves my Government. I feel victim of a questionable marketing tactic. Waste of money."
4,Versatile,"After a lot of looking around in the various department stores and net I could not find anything as versatile. The price was also impressive as compared to what's out there. Steamed vegetables came out great. Excellent for sausages and fried eggs. I still have a lot of experimenting to do but so far I am happy with my purchase. One negative comment, not as easy as a frying pan to clean. I hear that this is the case with all these types of electric cookers so it does not reflect a deficiency on this product alone."
4,A Good Product,"We purchased two of these floor lamps and find them very useful. They are light enough to be portable, but sturdy and durable. We are happy with our purchase."
2,Not very close to Orthodox Christianity after all.,"In the introduction Duncan says that the Celtic religion is the religion of the mind in the heart, and therefore it resembles Eastern Orthodox Christianity. Unfortunately this book is iconoclastic, and therefore not recommendable for Orthodox - Celtic or Eastern alike. From page 5, ""Believe direct in the King of elements, Put behind thee ikon-worship"". The Orthodox do *not* worship images, but believe that the veneration of Holy Icons will be translated to the one depicted on the Icon. Those who refuse to venerate the Holy Icons were anathemized by the One and Undivided Church in 843AD. Perhaps Duncan is not aware of this? Or perhaps he is a protestant. This is not clear from his introduction. In any case this book is useless for Orthodx - Celtic or not. The Celtic Orthodox Tradition possess a Spiritual Wealth of Holy Icons, and it is really a shame that Duncan apparently is unaware of this. 2 stars for the nice binding."
1,This sunsreen didn't work!,"I tried to get this to work on my body, but I got sunburned all over my body! Don't buy this! It's terible!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Good But Not The Best Sondheim,"Though ITW is clever, with a witty book, brilliant lyrics and lovely score, it doesn't rate with better Sondheim like Company, A Little Night Music, Follies or Sweeney Todd. At times the score gets a little too repetitive and lugubrious. Just about every character has an exposition song, it gets to be a bit much after a while. Short on plot and heavy on character, what makes it work are the outstanding Sondheim lyrics, crystal clear and a joy to hear every word in this show, ITW proves that Sondheim has no peer as a lyricist. And a couple great Sondheim ballads, No More and No One Is Alone make it a fine score, though not near his best."
3,One of Sondheim's most puzzling cast recordings.,"For better or worse, Sondheim's shows are often represented either very well or very poorly in the cast recordings. It's a shame that Into the Woods must be placed into the latter category, but the magic that filled the show onstage is practically nowhere to be found. The performers, which include such established veterans as Bernadette Peters and Joanna Gleason, just don't come to life. If you're a Sondheim fan, you will probably want this disc, but unless you have to have it, get the video production of the play. The music is all the same, but it's hard to believe they both came from the same show."
3,Not my cup of tea,"This is the kind of musical best experienced on stage, and I haven't yet. I'm sure that when I do, I'll be able to enjoy the music better."
5,Excellent!,"My 7 year-old and I absolutely LOVE this production. She had already been exposed to all the fairy tales touched on in the play, and because of the excellent story-telling, has begun to seek out other retold fairy tales in literature. And she has printed out the lyrics to many of the songs and sings them almost constantly throughout the day."
4,It's great if you've seen the musical,"We listen to this soundtrack a lot and certainly enjoy it, but we've also seen the musical. I'm not sure I'd like it as much if I hadn't seen the piece."
1,Don't waste your money on this one,"Once again,Sondheim has churned out another pointless dud.You'll lament in agony as you listen to this ear-splitting music that will give you a migraine after 2 minutes.We had to put up with tacky ragtime,an irritating barber,and other lackluster duds.Now we have a bunch of fairy tales carelessly slapped together.Alright-we get the joke already,Sondheim!No more!The songs and music are horribly performed and dragged on and on and ond.It makes wonder what the point of this torturiously long CD was,or if there even IS a point(which none of Sondheim's duds have).It also makes you wonder why Sondheim wastes our time with his irritating musicals.My advice:If you want good soundtracks,go with Rodgers&Hammerstein or Andrew Lloyd Webber.Don't waste your time or money on Sondheim."
3,"A great score, but not remastered since 1988? Please!","Into the Woods is wonderful. I saw the original show twice on Broadway in the late 80s. The performance, the score, you name it - none of it can be beat. Have I ever replaced my cassette of the show with this CD? Nope. The CD was cut back in 1988 and has never been remastered to take advantage of the great improvements that have been made since in CD production.So, I'll wait. Perhaps the owners of this title will listen..."
4,A Musical Masterpiece/A Theatrical Flop,"Stephen Sondheim is no question the musical genius of this century. His songs like ""No More"" and the energetic and witty ""Into The Woods"" fill this score with loveable and emotional music moments that are sure to not be forgotten. On the other hand I highly recommend you skip the chance to see the production live (unless of course J.Gleason or B.Peters are performing). The show is filled with weak segues and character interactions. Buy the CD and save your money."
4,Sondheim's most heartfelt score,"It's been said that this isn't Sondheim's best score, but it is certainly his least ""clever-clever"" and his most sincere, and there are some absolutely superb songs in it: the wishful waltz ""Moments in the Woods,"" the gorgeous ""Agony,"" and the famous, lovely ballad ""No One is Alone."" There's an absolutely wonderful cast, with wonderful turns by Peters and Gleason, a very charming comic performance by Danielle Ferland (with her little Mermanesque voice), and a very haunting and heartbreakingly sweet performance by Kim Crosby (the first time you hear her sing the final ""I wish..."" your heart will snap in two)."
4,And Happily Ever After! (?),"This is a great musical, as I saw the original with Bernadette Peters and have acted in it. The plot is incredible (where does Sondheim get these ideas?) and the music is surpasses some of the most revered scores shown on Broadway (I won't say which ones or else I will get unecessary hate mail). Great singers are Joanna Gleason as the Baker's wife (Moments in the Woods), and of course, Peter's rendition of the Witch (Last Midnight). The music cuts out a lot of dialouge, but that's only more motivation to go see the play! Or buy the DVD, whatever floats your boat."
5,It's Spectacular...Clever...Brilliantly Performed...Fun!!!,"This album is sure to delight audiences young and old! It is a must-have for any lover of musical theater! The score is beautiful, and the lyrics are incredilby intelligent, reflecting what is, to the careful listener, an extremely psychological show! Finally the talent reflected by the performers is incredible...especially Bernadette Peters, who gives one of the best performances of her career. All in all...it's non-stop entertainment!!!!!"
5,Great album..,"Amazing.. the music is great, the play is great, everything is great including the huge linear notes (the case is a big 2-CD holder, but has only 1 CD in it, the other part just holds the linear notes.. great! If you want the plot etc.. just read another person's five star review, they're all really long.. :-)"
3,"Good show, bad reissue","This remains the best recording of this excellent show BUT the remastered version is presented very poorly when compared to the initial release.No libretto, a few black and white photos (as compared to the original colour ones), and a superficial essay - not even a summary of the show's plot. Ridiculous. Sondheim deserves much better.The bonus tracks are of minimal interest, so if you own the original, keep it. You are much better off."
5,Great for Massage,"I've been using this product in my massage therapy practice for the past year, and my clients LOVE it. It's not to be used all over, but is especially effective with deep tissue work in problem areas. I highly recommend!"
1,Disappointed,This was more of a thick lotion that does not absorb well into the skin. I needed pain relief and this did not even help sore muscles.
5,Helps so much!,"Helps with sore muscles, the feel is great, the smell is pleasant.Easy to use and spread does not stain or bother, Good product."
5,Great product,This product is the best I've found so far. I Mixed some with plain oil and worked wonderful. A little added heats up muscles and it smells so good. I will buy again.
2,Difficult Reading...,"I am a voracious reader with some knowledge of art history, but after attempting to read this book for the last six months, I am finally stopping at the half-way mark. It is certainly full of new facts and demonstrates an exhaustive amount of research, but I find Sweetman's narrative plodding and unorganized. Also, the book pre-supposes the reader's depth of knowledge on the subject -- the lack of which is quite obviously my problem in enjoying the book."
4,Still Strong Three Years Later,"I have been a Motley Crue fan for years, and was more than psyched when Vince Neil was back on vocals. Generation Swine is nothing like any of the previous Crue albums out there, but this is the Crue we're talking about here. It's still damn good. Crue fans will be pleasantly suprised.Generation Swine has a song for everyone on it, and the 17 songs make it an excellent buy. ""Afraid"" is one awesome slow tempo song, and the title track of ""Generation Swine"" is a fast-paced, thunderous song with amazing drums. And of course, ""Shout at the Devil '97"" brings back wicked memories of their second album. Motley rocks like old on this album!The songwriting is superb as usual, and the lyrics definately stand out strong on this album. On the whole, this is one great cd, and a must for all fans of hard rock."
2,Two songs on the album are decent......thats it!!!,"Save your money and purchase greatest hits which has ""Afraid"" on it. That is the only track that should catch your attention. This album was originally going to feature Jon Corabi, who sang on the '94 release of Motley Crue ""4 star album"". Generation Swine sounds hurried, it seems that when Corabi ubruptly left the Crue, Vince was hurried in to complete the album. The Greatest Hits album should also tell Crue fans how much the band thought of Generation, only two songs on Swine are on Greatist hits. In concert the band only plays ""Afraid"". I have been a Motley fan since ""Too fast for Love"" and have seen the Crue 11 times. The top Motley albums in my opinion are as follows: Too fast for love, Quarternary, Dr. FeelGood, Shout and Motley Crue. Check out the release of Motley Crue with Jon Corabi, it is the heaviest album that they have done."
4,Not A Bad CD,"This cd is actually not as bad as some people think it is. It has great tunes like Afraid, Flush, and Confessions. But it has a great remake of Shout At The Devil, great track, hard and heavy. I just dont get Tommy Lee's singing on here, he's got a great voice with his cd's Methods Of Mayhem and Never A Dull Moment but him singing on a Crue album is just wrong Motley is great with Vince and the occasional back up but no Tommy on a Crue cd. I do suggest this cd for a big Crue fan but if your not much of a Crue fan try other selections first like Dr. Feelgood or Vince Neil's Exposed. But still this is not a bad cd."
2,Sounds nothing like the Crue!,"Except for LET US PREY and SHOUT AT THE DEVIL `97, this album sounds nothing like Motley Crue. First, where is the pounding bass drum and the wicked guitar riffs? They seem to be completely missing. Then, I don't know what he was doing, but Vince Neil sounded nothing like he did on their earlier albums. It was almost as if they had yet another lead singer there. When I listen to a Crue album, I want to hear that high pitched scream of his.Not that this was a bad album. For another band, this is a very solid rock album. Nothing special, mind you. Just a good piece of work. There weren't really any songs on the album that caught my ear...they all seemed pretty mediocre. For a Motley Crue album, it was a disappointment, but an improvement over their self titled release with John Corabi on vocals (ugh!).If you're looking for an album that smacks of old Motley Crue, then this album will be a big disappointment. It was to me."
4,Last Real Creative Leap For Crue,"Generation Swine is definatley one of the best reunion albums ever made. With the Crue coming off its best sessions in 1994, this one continued the growth into more elaborate sounds. And guess what? It worked.Except for two cheesy love ballads in ""Brandon"" and ""Rocketship"" this album is another creative leap for the Crue. Scott Humphrey's involvement here does not hinder the band in anyway. the electronic sounds employed on the album bring the Crue's sound to a whole new level.In ""Beauty"" you can almost hear the Methods of Mayhem-style influences creeping in. ""Generation Swine"" and ""A Rat Like Me"" are great Sex Pistols-type punk rock alas Nikki's Sid Viscious style chain during this period.Looking at the stuff that the Crue is putting out in the near future, this album might prove to be the last time the crue were relevant in being a creative force (instead of the hedonistic cock rock machine of the 80s)."
1,where's Corabi,"I'm sure Sixx is thinking the same thing.Vince belongs no where on this album.considering Corabi wrote most of the matrial.This sound does not suit Vince,he should stick to lipstick & make-up and shake his ass elsewhere.Leave this kind of music to real musicians."
2,motley crues generation swine,I think this album would be better if they did it with john corabi then it would sound better
2,A dissapointment,I love the Crue their my fav. But this one is by far the worst they ever done. I like A Rat like me it is the only one that sound anywhere near the normal Crüe songs.
1,Terrible return for the crue,This cd had only one goodsong. They tried to be techno. It did not work. I think this cd is terrible.
2,A step in the wrong direction...,"File under 'disappointment'.The Crue were never supposed to sound like trailerpark Nirvana with a little bit of Marilyn Manson thrown in just in the right measure to take away the bite and replace it with sorry attempts at politically correct rock.So,where's Dr.Feelgood?"
5,Cruester Swine!,"This album hella ROCKED! . All the songs on the album kicked ... ""Brandon"" was a song written and sung by Tommy dedicated to he's newly born son. I would have done the same thing. ""Glitter"" is a Motley ballet that should not be overlooked. It is up there with ""Home Sweet Home"". Buy it!"
5,Sounds even better now...,"I really liked this CD when it came out, but when I listen to it now I LOVE it. At the time it kind of bothered me that it didn't have that Bob Rock produced sound, but that's one of the things I really appreciate about it now. There's not one weak song in the bunch - even the bonus tracks are killer. If I had to pick favorites I would say ""Find Myself"", ""Generation Swine"", ""Confessions"" and ""Let Us Pray"". A lot of people have poked fun at Tommy's ""Brandon"", but if you open your mind, get past the opening, you'll find it's a really beautiful piece that DOES belong on this CD, as it marks that period in the Crue's history. If we ever get another Crue CD I hope this is where they pick up where they left off. Long live Motley Crue!"
1,What the hell was that????,"That ""Shout at the Devil"" rendition blew me away!!! Where is that Motley Crue that once was?There are die hard fans out here that hope that the CRUE will get ""On With the Show."""
5,I loved this cd,"I've had this cd for years & remember the first time I head it while stationed in Guam. Heard this & Hog "" Nothing Sacred "" ( one of the best underated punk cd's of all time ) and I really liked this cd. It was right for the times of electronica & sampling. The songs had great hooks as well. Find Myself & Afraid back to back is epic...ThanxDavid"
3,could be better,"some of you reviewers embarass me as a crue fan. especially the poser who is no longer a crue fan because of this album. good, we dont need you anyway(fair weather fan). shout 97 was the saviour of this album. its the primary reason i listened again and again...the only reason i learned the other songs. probably my least fav crue album..but you dont turn you back on your band cuz they put out a less than perfect (in your opinion) album. shout is nikki's creation..he can do/redo it any way he wants to...i thought it rocked...although i do not care for the album as a whole. still a crue fan till the end."
3,Better without Jon Corabi..Jon who?,"If there was a Crue album that i chose to keep out of my collection it would have to be Generation Swine,only die hard Crue fans would have it.This is actually a Jon Corabi related Crue album,that is why i have to mention Vince Neil went in and dubbed over his voice with his very own one and only Crue voice.The best song on this album to me is ""Glitter"".But on the other hand Tommy Lee is amazing on drums,he left the band soon after and was replaced by the late great former Ozzy drummer Randy Castillo for the next album.Crue brings their influences into this album as the closest to a punk Crue album you will ever hear.You can take a chance on this one but if you arent into collecting Crue albums,keep on walkin."
3,Weak Effort,"I love the crue,but this cd should've never seen the light of day.This album was built around and for John Corabi.The tracks sound as if they just had Vince come in and do his vocals over the songs.Not good!I know the powers that be were in a hurry for material with the reformed band,but this was not very smart.IMO they should've shelved this cd,and started something fresh with Vince.But all that being said,""Flush""is kinda cool,""Confessions""is also not a bad tune.""A rat like me""is to me the closest song on here suited for Vince.And as for Nikki and Tommy's singing on this cd:WRONG!Very un-crue like!But if you can get this cd cheap,get it(I only bought it to keep my crue collection complete!).But I still love ya guys!"
1,IS THE CRUE THRU!!??,"The raw edge is gone, the power is gone, and most importantly, it looks like the ""CRUE"" is officially gone. Stick with the first five classic studio albums. We can always remember the rockin times, can't we??"
3,3 and a 1/2 stars. 6 good songs and the other songs are not,"The best songs on the cd are find myself,flush or rockship(a quasi-leadzepplin acoustic type song its a ""toss up"" between the 2 songs),Generationswine, Anybody out there, let us prey and devil 97. Afraid is ok these other songs above are superior. All of the songs above are about 10-20% industrial rock and 70% guitar rock. Motleys best albums are shout at the devil, Girls, girls, girls and Dr. feelgood. there best songs are primal scream , rock n roll junkie, shout at the devil 97, dr. feelgood,looks that kill, too young to fall in love, and kick start my heart, wild side and all in the name of rock. the song let us prey sounds somewhat like metallicas ride the lighting rewritten by rob zombie. But make no mistake the 6 good songs on this cd are heavy metal industrial thunder."
3,A MINOR LETDOWN...,"I expected more with the return of Vince Neil...but apparently, on this album, the Crue was too busy trying to distance themselves from what they do best...guitar driven, tongue in cheek, loud, in your face rock 'n roll. There's no ""Dr. Feelgood"" ""Girlsx3"" or ""Don't Go Away Mad"" on here. The strongest tracks are Glitter (even though the Hits version is alot better), Confessions, Rat Like Me, and Let Us Prey. If you're a rock fan, it's worth the bucks, but don't expect a classic like Dr. Feelgood or Shout at the Devil. Hopefully the boys will get it right next time...anyways, CAN'T WAIT TO CATCH 'EM ON TOUR THIS SUMMER!!!"
1,Dissapointed,"I, like some of the other reviewers here, had hoped that Motley Crue's reunion with Vince Neil would signal the beginning of a renewed popularity of fun, heavy metal music. I am sadly dissapointed with Generation Swine. ""Brandon"" may be the worst song ever recorded, and the Shout at the Devil re-make makes me cringe. And, now they are going to re-release this album with ""bonus tracks."" Oh boy! I can't wait to hear stuff that was bad enough to be left off this when it was first release..."
4,Generation Mine,"One of the reasons Motley has ALWAYS been my favorite band was that they weren't afraid of what people thought of them and their music, or their image. They did a lot of changing and it shows on this album, which, I hate to say, is my least favorite out of the catalog,( Next to that non-existant one without Vince!). Hard to classify just what this sound falls into, and not all of the tunes reached out and smacked me, but it ain't bad overall. Afraid, Find Myself,etc. Still, my main love was the fact that they all got back together. My boys didn't let me down in the long run and 5 years with no Motley really had me down for a time."
3,"Good quality, but not dripless","This is a good quality, well put-together product, no doubt about it. It generates superior leverage to extrude thicker caulks. However, because it is NOT dripless (as an earlier reviewer claimed), it has limited application for anything other than caulking sidewalk isolation joints, fire caulking, and the like. You have to push the thumb-release tab to relieve the considerable pressure on the tube, and if you're going to be doing that much, you might as well just buy a dripless caulk gun and save yourself the hassle. I would not recommend this gun for interior caulking or anything delicate."
1,VERY DISAPPIONTED !!!!,"The shipping was very fast and reliable.But when i got the part, and got it on my truck, with in a month the new part done the same thing as the old one. Which left me stranded on the side of the road. So not only did i Pay $119 for the part but i had to pay $50 more just to get it towed off the road and to my house so now i have paid $119 for the part and $50 for the tow And $5 more to ship it back so i can get the money back which i will probably only get the $119 and the $5 back.So now im down $50 unless they decide to reimburse me for that too."
2,Volume III,Not a complete version.. only has SOME of the tales. I didnt realize that when I bought it!
4,good,"The product arrived quickly and was wrapped well- but I can't imagine that it really cost $10 for shipping! In fact, I know it didin't cost that much to ship it. Seems a bit outrageous that the shipping cost as much as 3 jars of jelly. Because of the high cost for shipping I may not order again. It is for a gift so I have no idea about the taste or quality yet."
5,Interesting stories and good recipes,My family is of Russian descent and I wanted to give my son a recipe book with traditional recipes. This book had theadded bonus of little essays that added to the charm. The recipes are very good.
2,Pedestrian and Platitudinous,"The traditional Lakota folktales are interesting, as are the historical comments about the destruction of the Lakota way of life at the hands of the genocidal American government. The tales from contemporary reservation life are not very absorbing, and the ethical comments become tedious in time. They are too sentimental for my taste. I was looking for something more shamanistic, I'm afraid. Not a re-read."
4,Great Book!,"I live near and work on a reservation in SD. I wanted to read this book to understand the viewpionts my Native American friends better. The way Marshall is able to explain the virtues from a historical, traditional perspective and relate them to modern day is wonderful and easily understood. This is a great book!"
5,The Lakota Way,"This book is a great book written by a Lakota man. The stories he tells in the book are very inspiring. He has a humble approach to teaching through stories of the ""Old Ones,"" and is fantastic with explaining values. I recommend this book to the Lakota youth and anyone that loves stories that were passed down from generation to generation."
4,In This Book India was Important,"I would give this book a four star rating. I would recommend this book to a friend. In this book I felt as if India was important. Some characters in this book were supportive, and liked India. This is a good book and I think Indians would really like it. Girls would probably like this book."
2,Misleading,"This book is out dated and I've never met anyone like that. Aruna might be disliked because her personality doesn't match people she hangs out with. Aruna Journey is from an older time and doesn't reflect current situations. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, because they will get the wrong idea about Indians. For example, Aruna's parents don't let her have sleepovers or become what she wants when she grows up but other Indians do that. Or Vandana's education and marriage other families in India have love marriage, and everyone gets an education, and they are Indian. This book is not very good and I give a recommendation to nobody."
3,Okay-ish,"This book made me feel different. I felt that I wasn't something good, like all Indians/Indian Americans were bad. But they did show our traditions and stories. I liked that the author showed character in each of them. I would not recommend this to anybody, because again, it made me feel different than who I am. My relationship with India is that my parents are from India, so is the rest of my family, except my grandpa. Though I was not born in India, I still love India."
3,This is a Good Book but Needs Touching Up,"This book is really good, but I think the author could have done some things much better because some of the things in this book are very stereotypical, like when she's at her friend's house eating a hamburger and they call it the ""American dream."" The author also made the parents of Aruna not very time wise because right when Aruna wants to go to summer camp they want to go to India. I would rather go to India, but she was kind of selfish because she wanted to go to summer camp. The part I liked was when Vandana went on a hunger strike since it was unique. Next time the author writes a book, she should get rid of stereotypes."
4,Love the container!,"Love this straw dispenser! It is just what I wanted. You might want to toss the straws that come in it, because they split easily (at least the ones that I received do). No biggie...just a heads up."
5,Straw Container,I collect coke things.I loved the size and the quality of the glass.Very impressed! I haven't tried the straws yet.I might just leave them cause they look good as is...
3,Not tall enough for straws.,I had to bend the straws to put them in the jar. Either the jar needs to be taller or the lifter needs to fit further into the jar.
3,Not bad,"I purchased this item years ago for my three year old daughter. She loved it. I rolled her around in it and she had hours of fun with it. However, one day it got a tear SOMEWHERE. We searched everywhere but could not find it. So we would blow it up and within 30 minutes it was deflating. Sadly we had to throw it away. A good toy, lots of fun but very delicate."
3,"Hey, I'm in the 80's","Well, Crue has served up a dish of 80's music. If you're starving for this kind of stuff, get it. If not, put on your old Crue records and you're likely to hear better music. These guys are gettin' old. Crue, please retire with grace."
5,"MOTLEY CRUE HAS A ""NEW TATTOO""","Well, its been a long time coming. The nineties music scene has been the biggest disappointment thus far in the world of Rock N Roll, until now. July 11, 2000 and Motley Crue releases the best studio album in years that fans have long awaited. This album has everything from Ballad to Groove to non-stop headbanging. When you listen to this latest release of Motley Crue you'll be reminded of what Rock N Roll was all about. Which is kick-a**, good time, party music. Being a huge fan of the 80's SUPERBANDS like Poison and Skid Row. I'm so glad Motley Crue has given the fans something worth listening too. This album is well appreciated by all the fans who never stopped believing in true Rock N Roll, Motley style..."
3,It's OK,"I really wonder where the heck Motley Crue is going. ""New Tattoo"" is an OK CD with a few catchy tracks, but otherwise, it doesn't rate up there with other Motley classics. While I like Motley of old (TFFL, SATD, and Dr.F), I really enjoyed MC94 (which remains one of my top 10 CDs) and giving it a fresh listen to, Generation Swine was a solid rock CD. Of course, on first listen to of GS I wished the band picked up at Dr. Feelgood. Now, I wish they had stayed the course along the lines of Swine. For one thing, New Tattoo sounds forced, like the band purposely made it sound like something from the 80s... and struggled to do it. The best songs are Hell on High Heels (very catchy), Treat Me Like the Dog I Am, and Punched in the Teeth By Love. Otherwise I am disappointed. I should have picked up the reissue of MC94 or TTFL instead."
1,I think I'm gonna cry...,"I'm a HUGE Crue fan, have been since SATD. I wanted to LOVE this friggin' record. It's not bad, but it's so AVERAGE, so run-of-the-mill, so boring. It used to be that each Crue record was something new--a step forward. This is their first step backwards (can't blame 'em for trying to get their audience back)... What happened to the cool lyrics Nikki used to write? Dragstrip Superstar? ... And what happened to Randy Castillo? His playing on some of the Ozzy records is pretty good, but this? No imagination. This CD sounds like they put no effort in at all. Sigh..."
1,A return to form but....,"New Tatoo is a return to form for Motley Crue,but it lacks good songs. Sure the opener Hell on High Heels is good,and the cover of the Tubes song White Punks on Dope is good,but the remainder of the tracks are simply dull and uninspired. I like the fact that they returned to their original sound, but what good is it when you don't have quality songs on the record.It is cool, however that Randy Castillo is the drummer now, I would recommend either Dr.Feelgood or Shout at the Devil."
5,I knew they could do it,"Finally Nikki and the gang released an album worthy of 'Shout at the Devil'. SATD is a classic standing on a mountain, but New Tattoo gives it a run for it's money. This is probably Mick Mars' best guitar work ever. The riffs and solos he pulls out are the high points on every song.Vince sounds great, and Nikki wrote some awesome lyrics. Tommy is barely missed with Randy Castillo (RIP) beating the skins.I've been a CrueHead since the beginning. Everything old school Crue fans want are right here on this CD. Sex, drugs, silliness, and lots and lots of attitude. I have nothing but praise for the Crue on this release. Best album I bought this year. Rock on Crue!!!!!"
4,"Very very good, but expected a bit more","Being a HUGE Motley Crue fan thats dying to go to their nextconcert, it saddens me to be the first to give them 4 stars and not 5... but I gotta be honest. The songs are very good and it has excellent riffs, but Mick's guitar playing is very good but not catchy. Randy's drumming is EXCELLENT... makes me not miss Tommy Lee at all. All the songs are great, maybe 1 or 2 are good but not great. Hell on High Heels, Punched in the teeth by love, Treat me like the Dog I am and Hollywood Ending are by far my favorites. Fake is an exact replica of Shout at the Devil so its cool, Pornostar is good except for the nanana part. Dragstrip Superstar is too similar to HOHH and the rest are ok. The reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 is because its a good cd but there's not enough agressiveness on it.. especially on Vince Neil's voice. But overall an excellent cd.. I strongly recommend everyone to buy it"
1,complete garbage,"hOW CAN ANYONE LISTEN to this trash.""PEOPLE"" Vince Neil is soooo awful a singer it's hopeless for him.The best Motley Crue line=up died when all you silly fans wanted that idiot back in the band.Too bad for you.Pick up some Union with Corabi & bruce kulick and see just how bad Motley Crue with vince really is"
1,What happened?,"Back in the '80s when the heavy metal well was running dry it just seemed like the Crue was just your average glam band. They started out so strong with thier first two albums but then just seemed to fall into the category of ordinary. They finally broke out of that, but at the expense of breaking up the band (it just ain't the Crue without all four members). Then the Crue was back, and I just so happened to come across Generation Swine in the used CD bin. So I figured ""what the heck"" and bought it. To my dismay, it was actually original, innovative, and by far the Crue's best. You could tell that they put a lot of effort into the album. Now, much like their fellow metal brethren, Dokken, the Crue has slithered back into mediocrity, content to sell the masses the same old schlok that they produced in the '80s. How very disappointing."
1,the worst lp they could do,"i cant believe this is a motley lp,all the songs are really really bad!!!!"
2,CRUE is not back...,"this record should have included a letter from nikki. and it would go something like this...DEAR CRUEHEADS,Well, we tried to grow. We were really proud of MC '94 and (most of) Generation Swine. But no one's listening. So if all you want is mindless sleaze like the old daze (Theatre, Girls), you got it!Tommy's gone, Vince is back (sort of). There are a couple good tracks on here, and a really bad cover to boot. Enjoy!- N. Sixx"
4,"Wow, I overlooked this one...","I never really listened to this album all the way through this is a really, great album I like it much better then SOLA. The songs are catchy and have enough hooks to make Kareem Abdul JaBaar blush. I read this was the album they wanted to put out after Dr. Feelgood, which would have been a really good call. This is pure sleeze pop-metal and I could listen to the album from start to finish. Punched In The Teeth and the cover of White Punks on Dope, Drag Strip, Hollywood Ending are my favorite songs off this nearly perfect album. This is officially my 3rd favorite Crue album now."
4,surprisingly good,"At the risk of sounding like everyone else, this is the album that should have followed Dr. Feelgood. I bought it the other day and have been really surprised by how good it is. A throwback to the glory days of the 80's. The song writing is the most intricate the Crue has done on any album. Although it's no Shout at the Devil, this is a very good buy for people starved for some good old fashioned, make you want to drink beer and party 80's style music. A must buy for Crue fans."
3,Not there best & not there worst...,"When I first heard this CD I absolutely loved it, but as it wore on me, I realized it was just ok. Very glam / 80's oriented which is a good thing, but just after awhile the songs lost it's punch with me...Overall, good...ThanxDavid"
4,New tatoo,"It was a good album.Althought Tommy Lee was not on drums it still kicked ass but not the same energy as the original Crue,but never the less it was still a great album."
5,NEW TATTOO-OLD MOTLEY CRUE,"New Tattoo is a cross from Too Fast For Love, Girls, Girls, Girls,and Shout at the Devil. This is a good album, a quality album with sounds from the older Crue albums."
3,throwing in the towel...,"after three records in a row testing new ground (feelgood/mc/swine) the crue returns to familiar, safe territory with the time-capsule sounding new tattoo. while a little better than theatre/girls, this sounds like the album that could have come between them. basically nikki succumbed to the negative comments on motley's more progressive sound on mc94/swine and has reverted to the now tired sex, drugs and rock n'roll themes. and while there are good songs on tattoo (""hell on high heels"" and ""hollywood ending"" especially), the problem is it doesn't feel genuine anymore. you can't be 40 years old, married with children and still writing songs like ""treat me a like a dog"" and ""porno star""..."
2,If it grows on me it will be like a fungus,There is nothing great about this cd. It appears to me that the Crue have been living off their past laurels of Dr. Feelgood and other earlier works. At best I enjoyed 3 songs. I wish I'd purchased it at a store that allows returns or exchanges. I have a 200 cd changer and will put it in there occasionally in full random mode so the songs will only pop up only once in a while. To listen to it beginning to end is not a very appealing idea. Quite a few bands I grew up with have been very disappointing the last few years. The new Dokken is very good though.
5,Score for listening stations,"I must admit, I was never a huge fan of this band, and I've actually been a bit put off ever since I first heard the ""Afraid"" song from Generation Swine. I did buy the self-titled release with John Corabi and I think it's ok, but it's not enough to really get me into what the band was doing. Then I saw this on a listening station so I gave it a try. This album has got it all, the rockers (""Hell on High Heels"", ""Punched in the Teeth by Love""), the ballads (and actually not to terrible), and the silly (""1st Band on the Moon"", ""Porno Star""). On of the best surprises is the cover of ""White Punks on Dope"" at the end. This song seems tailor-made for the band. I wasn't real sure they had it in them, but this is perhaps their best album yet. Maybe Tommy Lee shouldn't have gone on to do his own thing."
2,I was disappointed,"As a big fan of eighties rock/metal, I am still waiting on a big release to bring that style back. I've heard great things about New Tattoo, so I bought it over the weekend & had an open mind when listening to it a few times.Other than the great opener Hell on High Heels, the rest of the music went downhill from there. Their music is just not as good as it once was, when they were in their prime. This is a good effort, but overall I was disappointed. In fact, I returned the cd back to the place I bought it.I also think alot of those positive reviews, (saying this is such a great cd)were written by Motley Crue die-hards who would say great things about their cd's, no matter how lousy it was. (I personally know a few people like this.)"
2,Motley Bland,"I bought the new Crue album last week and have to say that I am disappointed. I kept hearing how this would be their best effort since Dr. Feelgood. The problem, to me, is that there is nothing on this album that compares to the better songs on Dr. Feelgood. I don't know if it's because I've grown out of Motley Crue (I still love many of their previous songs)or because this album just isn't very good. In my opinion, the songs are even more juvenile than before and with a couple of exceptions aren't catchy. The music itself is catchy in some cases but the lyrics (not the vocals, this isn't a jab at Vince Neil) that accompany it are bad for the most part. I think many of their fans will like this just because they were so excited for new material to be released that it doesn't matter how good it really is. I'll give it a few more listens prior to tossing it aside in hopes that my opinion will change. Some bands just fade away (I hope this isn't one of them)."
5,The Bad Boys of Rock-N-Roll are Back,"After the long wait of a new cd, the boys in the Crue did not let us down.They did not sell out to the industry like some other bands we know, but instead they wrote 11 songs that will leave you wanting more. From the ripping ""Hell on High Heels"" to the ballad ""New Tattoo"". This is definately the best cd of the year and close to one of Motley's best."
3,Almost lame......,"Honestly this is the third worst release from the Crue - after Generation Swine and Theatre of Pain. But there are some tracks that are decent such as White Punks on Dope (cover song go figure), Fake and New Tattoo are decent catchy Crue tracks. Castillo does an adequate job (God rest his soul) and Mars is his typical high standard guitar playing. Sixx on the other hand f'd up the lyrics throughout this release. Neil - well he sounds good and that is about it."
3,Much better than Generation Swine!,"Overall it is a good cd. The only problem that I have with it is that there are 4 filler songs, and they sound alike. The songs ""Fake, Dragstrip Superstar, White Punks on Dope and Hollywood Ending are classic Crue. Randy Castillo did a great job on the album, God rest his soul."
4,"Kevin, recently acquired Crue fan","Dr.Feelgood and Decadence albums were all the Crue I had prior to New Tattoo album,but I found it as enjoyable as the others and will now be searching the archives for more Motley Crue standards."
5,bad boys our back,"I CAN`T REMEMBER WHEN THE LAST CD CAME OUT THAT I LIKED THIS MUCH.I ALWAYS LIKED MOTLEY CRUE BACK IN THE 80`S BUT THEY LOST VINCE AND WHEN HE CAME BACK THEY MADE THAT LEMON GENERATION SWINE.BUT THIS IS A GREAT ROCK N ROLL CD.HELL ON HIGH HELLS IS THE SONG THEY PLAY ALOT BUT THERE ARE ALOT OF OTHER GREAT SONGS ON THIS LIKE NEW TATTOO,FAKE,& WHITE PUNKS ON DOPE.BUT ALL THE SONGS ON THIS ARE GOOD.BUY THIS IF YOU ARE A MOTLEY CRUE FAN OF THE 80`S."
4,New Tattoo---A must have CD,Motley Crue have finally gone back to straight ahead Rock-n-Roll. The songs on this CD just groove. Seems like they have found new life with the addition of Randy Castillo. Hell on High Heels and Punched in The Teeth by Love are a couple of straight ahead rock songs. This CD is way better than Generation Swine.
1,Waste of Money,"I bought this as a book and a download based on the editorial description. Just as the other reviewers said (I wish I had read them before I bought the book from Packt website!!!), the editorial description is misleading. All this book does is list the various menu items and options and VERY BRIEFLY describes what they do. There is no tutorial here, there is no step-by-step here.Honestly, I played with the software for a few hours before I bought the book and I felt I was already way ahead of what was written here. Bitterly disappointed."
2,Major Disappointment,"I was really excited to get this book, and I am sad to write this review, because there are so few books that I honestly do not like. For the price I was expecting something at least step by step. This book is basically the documentation placed in book form. This was the only joomla book out at the time and I really wanted to expand the joomla based websites that I manage. There was nothing useful in this book for me, and I have to admit that I felt really ripped off. I can't recommend this book to anyone except a complete beginner, and honestly, a beginner may be completely lost. At this point the only way to learn joomla (which is awesome) is by trial and error."
2,A bit disappointed,"There is no more in this book than what you can find in the Joomla user's manual. Most of the pages are screenshots that take you step by step through installation and initial setup.If you are a beginner, this book may be useful."
1,"Not even close to being a ""step by step tutorial""","Don't bother with this book. Most, if not all, of the information is readily available on the Joomla! website and goes no further in explaining things than the Joomla! website does. What few items it brings up, it only brings up in very little detail; often referencing websites that aren't available in multiple languages (often only in German).Ironically, the section dealing with clear content and writing clearly is riddled with spelling, content and grammatical errors. More or less sums up the rest of the book."
3,Lack of Specifics.,I was pleased by the fact that this book covered the CMS in general. In fact it has many screenshots and tutorials for a general user. I needed more information on the PHP back side.
4,Best Joomla book,"The best book on Joomla CMS for website development. Very practical and oriented towards the beginner. A bit pricey, but then it is the best in it's kind."
1,Disappointing,"Sadly, this book contains very little that's not in the free official Joomla user manual, and what it does contain is not very clearly presented.The author spends most of his time explaining things that should be obvious to anyone using the program, serving up such gems as ""Site name: This is the name of the site...""Hopefully the new crop of Joomla books slated for publication will offer more. Until then, save your money."
1,Elementary and rudimentary,"This books does not live up to its title. Most of the examples are code dumps with rudimentary explanations. The author obviously does not know effective teaching skills such as the power of diagrams and pictures. Screen dumps of Joomla! are of awful quality and resolution and are completely out of their aspect ratio.My biggest disappointment was Chapter 15 - Your Own Components, Modules, and Plug-ins. The is mostly a dump of source code with minimial comments and explanations. There is no description of the control flow within Joomla. It is assumed that one is an expert on Joomla and ""entry points"". A sentence such as ""Experts on entry points will notice that this looks very familiar"" is quite arrogant in a book which is supposed to be a tutorial.I recommend the author to read one of Sitepoint's (I dont work for them, btw) books to understand how to write good books.Lucky for me, my copy was a borrowed one and not bought.PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK."
2,Very Basic Beginners Guide,"Being a hacker who liked to play with Open source software, I read the book jacket and purchasedBuilding Websites with Joomla!because I thought it would tell me more then I knew already. It was not necessarily all that great. It confirmed what I knew but not much more.I now build websites using Joomla and I can say you may want to get a more detailed and relevant document if you have any experience with Joomla."
5,Perfect for learning Joomla! 1.0x,"Hagen has done a beautiful job at explaining how to use Joomla!. From installation to using all the wonderful features of Joomla! to installing third party extensions to creating your own templates and extensions, this book will have you up and running as quick and with about as comprehensive understanding as possible.As a user of Joomla! from the very beginning of its inception and long time user of its ancestor, Mambo, I wish I had something like this to take me by the hand and start me off when I first began. Everything is all in a nice tidy little package which can be referenced again and again as needed. I even learned a thing or two I didn't know before by reading this.This book is a great investment for anyone wishing for a thorough introduction to Joomla! Open Source CMS."
5,Much better than expected,"I've read a lot of nautical history and fiction from this era but I put off buying this book because I thought ""How interesting can a book about salted meat and biscuits be?"" I was wrong. This book proved to be very interesting and well-written. While I am not an expert, it appeared to me to be well-researched as well. Most, but not all, the documents referenced were generated during the Napoleonic Wars. I highly recommend it to anyone fascinated by ""tall ships"" and ""hearts of oak""."
5,At least partially autobiographical tale of interracial love in the Pacific,"Albert Wendt is on faculty now at the University of Hawaii, and he and his wife are wonderful, friendly people. This book is an early (1973) partially autobiographical novel of his love for his wife. He's a Samoan immigrant to New Zealand and she's a white native. The cultural gaps are bridged with considerable sensitivity to all parties. The book has aged reasonably well, but it's a far less mature work than the author has produced more recently."
4,Live In Europe,"The Phil Woods quartet Live in Perugia, Italy 11/12/80 with Mike Mellilo on piano, Steve Gilmore bass and Bill Goodwin drums. The other Red Record 2 CD set live in Europe is a quintet recording from 1984 entitled INTEGRITY and features Tom Harrell on trumpet and Hal Galper on piano. Phil plays no clarinet on the quartet concert. He plays it on one track of the quintet recording."
4,Pico.....sticks to the roots,Bay of Sin is a good album. it has many faces. he sticks to the roots of surfing
1,Odd duck,"While this is advertised to be big enough for roasting a turkey, it isn't. Maybe a duck, maybe a big chicken, but not an average size turkey. When full of hot food it is extremely awkward to handle and it's easy to spill the contents and hot grease all over oneself and the kitchen. For a lot less there are great roasters on the market. This is a monster to store between big cooking jobs and takes up most of the dishwasher when cleaning.A real quacker!"
2,Very Bad Print,The printing for this Bible is very bad. The pages are so thin ink from the backpage bleeds through. The words of Christ are supposed to be in red but they appear to be a pale pink. Anyone with less than normal eyesight will have a difficult time reading this bible.
5,The Best Study Bible To Date,"The OLD Scofield is by far the best study Bible I have ever used. Most of the ""hard"" words are referenced in the margin without any harm to the text itself. The study notes, sometimes a bit difficult to understand, are by far the most comprehensive notes available. The concordance is better than most Bibles and the maps are the most accurate without buying a separate atlas. Scofield has also included a complete appendix for a name study and subject reference. Also included with this study Bible is a subject chain reference. The chain reference is extremely complete, and at the last reference verse is a summary of that particular subject. All of the ""old-time"" doctrines have been wonderfully preserved and explained in this study Bible. If you have any desire to know the Bible, the OLD Scofield is a MUST."
5,Unique and interesting,"This CD will grow on you the more you listen to it. A few of the songs border on techno yoga, but are still very good for a yoga class. ""Crossing the Desert"" and ""Remebrance"" are stand out songs that are great for savasana. There is only one song that I routinely skip over when I use it for class and that is ""Sringara,"" because its a little too much like the scene in the restaurant in ""When Harry met Sally."" Too much heavy breathing. Overall, I would recommend this CD."
5,LeClaire does it again...,"The Law Of Bound Hearts: Separate them and only one - at most - would survive.That statement sums up how Libby and Sam felt about each other as children...they were inseparable. All that changed one day when Libby did something to Sam that was unforgivable. Now, six years later, Libby is suffering from kidney failure and needs to find a donor and does not want to ask her sister Sam for help. As the story unfolds, we gradually learn a bit about each woman, where they are in their lives now, and what they are thinking and feeling. We also discover what transpired to bring them to this point in their strained relationship.Once again Anne LeClaire has woven a story that takes you on a magical journey to the heart of the family where no one is perfect and forgiveness is possible."
5,Fun and Informative,"I was excited about the book for my writing and also craft projects. I had it shipped to my daughter's house where I was going to be at delivery time. My daughter saw it and was very excited. She handed me the cash to reorder it.Of course, I gave her my copy and anxiously awaited the new copy!"
1,Don't Waste Your Time!,"I found this book to be of absolutely no value to me. It's chapters and phrases offer nothing new to the writer, wannabe writer or reader of Romance. If you're seeking to write a Romance, you should be able to come up with descriptive phrases without having to stop your writing and look up a phrase in the book. Additionally, if you have ever read a romance novel, as you should have if you're considering writing one, you don't need this book - just check out your old stack of paperbacks."
3,A great book if not taken seriously,"This is a very funny book. If you want a bit of a laugh then I can recommend it, however if you are silly enough to think that it is a legitimate reference book then you will be disappointed."
1,Seriously out-of-date,"This book was published in 1984, and it shows. Romantic fiction has moved way beyond the silly purple prose you find in this book. Before you rely on this book for inspiration, please read some Linda Howard or Jennifer Crusie."
4,What happened to my review of yesterday?,I reviewed this book yesterday and now I don't see it. What happened to it? I was told it was accepted.
3,I hate it when I need this book.,"When I received this book as a gift, I was vaguely insulted. I mean, really -- I want to feel I'm creative without outside assistance! I admit it -- I hate the thought of ever having to consult something like this.However, this book help break through writer's block. Reading the lists helps bring other ideas to mind, and since some entries can best be judged as humorous rather than romantic (to my mind, anyway), laughter can at least break the tension of that ""I'm stuck!"" feeling.Would I have bought this book? Never in a million years. But since I own it, I admit (with some shame) that I have flipped through it to jog my mind.Using this book for all one's descriptives would be a recipe for disaster. It's my personal rule not to use any phrases from the book (or any cliches, period). But as an ""assist,"" I've found it useful."
3,Better write your OWN phrases!,"This book should DEFINITELY be used as a LOOSE guideline ONLY!! (They even advise you of this in the introduction to the book) The phrases they provide sound like they were copied out of the first 10 romance books they could get their hands on! Don't look for original material...On the opposite side, it does serve as a muse to inspire you to create your own catch phrases.It wasn't totally useless as reference material, but had much to be desired..."
4,Great book to start your thoughts rolling,"This is a book that gets my thoughts going. Some of the phrases have become cliche, but there are over 3,000 descriptive tags here to choose from. Some made me laugh but most of them got me thinking of the ways my characters relate to one another."
4,Helpful,"This book is helpful for great ideas of various ways to word so many descriptions, physical and emotional. And it's good for sparking ideas of your own. I use it to help me say what I'm trying to say in as precise a way as possible while still getting the point across. Very helpful to writers of any fiction, but especially of the romantic type."
4,Great big brother t-shirt,"Very cute big brother t-shirt. Arrived as expected. Little concerned about the fading after wash, but realize this will happen."
4,Great product for the price,"The Tshirt is not the cheap kind you buy in the hospital gift shop, so worth paying an extra five bucks for it. Thank goodness they carry the Xlarge, although the sizes do run kind of small."
2,Torn T-Shirt Disappoints Grandson,"Three weeks ago, I purchased this t-shirt for my grandson, who was becoming a big brother. He was very excited about the t-shirt until we notices that there was a large tear in the side seam of the shirt. My daughter does not have a sewing machine, so I had to sew the seam by hand in order for it to be ready the the arrival of the baby sister. That was disappointing for both me and my grandson. He loved the picture and the message, however.I'm the BIG Brother, T-Shirt - New Big Brother Gift Idea!"
4,cute shirt,"These shirts are very cute and look just as pictured. I bought one for each of my boys as they await the arrival of their baby sister. One word of caution, however--they do run small. After reading other reviews, I ordered a size 6-8 for my 3-year-old, though I was nervous it would be huge. It's a little big, but I'm certain the 2-4 would have been too small, so I'm glad I ordered the next size up!"
3,Order a size larger and note there is a website printed on the shirt!,"Our son takes a 10/12 shirt size, therefore we purchased the 10/12 size in this shirt and we should have purchased the 14/16 because 10/12 was a little small.I think the shirt is really cute. Our son absolutely adores it and likes to show he is going to be a big brother. I was VERY disappointed to see a website printed on the shirt (which you can't really see on the picture, but it's that blue shape under ""brother""). I feel we paid 15.00 to advertise someone's website when the shirt was purchased to advertise our son is going to be a proud big brother."
2,Great tshirt; URL on front makes it look cheap,URL in blue box under the word brother makes the tshirt look like it should be given away free. Hard to see it before u buy it due to bad photo. I wouldn't give as a gift.
5,"Antiloop, proving techno can still be fresh","About a year ago, while perusing the shared drives of the other people on my apartment building's network, I found a directory of .mp3s by Antiloop. I liked the name, so I listened to a few of them, and I was blown away. Ever since then, I have been on a mostly fruitless quest to find Antiloop commercially--the only thing I could do is order them directly from Sweden, more or less.Antiloop is the most fantastically diverse yet consistently high-energy techno group I have ever had the pleasure of hearing. Their songs effortlessly range from hard trance to soft ambient, never losing their fantastic unique feel. This CD might not be their best, but it is still worth hearing."
1,please read description carefully,"This is for just one collar. This is not for a complete system, it is for one extra collar."
3,This is the way it was. Really.,"Is is possible for a black Southerner - or a white one - to write without predjudice? Apparently it is, and Dori Sanders has done so. She has no axe to grind, just a good story to tell about growing up on a black farm in South Carolina in the years that encompass (but do not end with) World War II and the beginnings of the Civil Rights movement. Just when you thought you knew ""how it was"", here comes a different slant: Mae Lee (like Dori Sanders herself) is unusual for a Southern black woman, in that she owns her farm -- not that that solves her problems."
5,excellent reading.,"Good reading. Written well and gives Leslie VanHoutens story the depth it never had before. Great insight to the times, the crimes and the person she is now."
1,Outragious Garbage,"This book is pure garbage, not only in content but in form and style. And clearly, the author is extremely biased towards Van Houten. I know this IS a BOOK REVIEW, but I feel compelled to express my opinion about the subject matter. Leslie Van Houten made conscious and sane decisions back in 1969. One of those decisions was to join the Manson family. Another was to participate in the murders of the LaBiancas. Whether she stabbed Mrs LaBianca after she was already dead or not is moot. As for her reform in prison, SO WHAT. She should feel lucky she avoided the Death Penalty. I hope that she never, ever gets out. And as for the author of this ""book"", and her clear affiliation and sympathy for this cold blooded murderer, shame on you."
1,Don't waste your money!,"This book was boring and not very well written. I had a difficult time staying interested and following events in the book. Karlene Faith presents a very subjective view of the Manson murders and the book's message throughout was "" Set Leslie Free"". I was hoping to learn something I didn't already know about Leslie Van Houten from this book, I didn't"
5,We reap what we sow,"I was a young woman of 25 when these murders occured. My newly married husband and I attended a seminar on the Manson murders a few years after that . I enjoyed the book , but have to say, NONE of the players in these brutal murders should EVER ,EVER, EVER be released under ANY circumstances. They should all die in prison. At least they are still alive, unlike their victims. I don't care if they live to be 100 years old, they should never taste freedom again. It is befitting that they be incarcerated until death claims them all. Watch what you do in your youth and be careful the decisions you make , because you may just pay for them with your entire life."
1,I Hate this Book,"From beginning to end, it is a worthless book. It is a naive, 60's apologia for brutal murders committed in cold blood. It is the same mentality that fawned over the acts of the Weathermen and other 60's terrorits groups. Shame, shame on this person for writing such a feeble, gender-obsessed view of the legal abuses endured by these wanton killers. This is the product of a television mentality. Life is not a television show, Ms. Faith! Life is not a sitcom! This book is worthless. (...) Readers, do not support this kind of hateful trash. We have grown beyond this as people. Obviously Ms. Faith cannot, anymore than the murderous creature she is trying to whitewash."
5,Good Design - Solid Performance,"I've used both Trippe and other UPS and surge supressors, and Trippe products just seem to work better. My APS systems seem to have a problem with outlets dying, not so with Trippe. The extra widespacing of the outlets are extremely convenient, given all the odd sized bricks that equipment comes with today.The batteries seem to recharge faster than other systems, too. This is important to me, as I live in a rural area with frequent power failures."
2,3 out of 7 are bad. 2'rd star is for Amazon service,"We've purchased 7 of these 750s now, and so far we've gotten 2 years or less out of three of them. We had 2 bad batteries and 1 that had software issues. Contacted Tripp-Lite(even though it was purchased from Amazon), and was met with a 40 min. barrage of questions and instructions to call back with a wattage-voltage meter handy. Figured it was easier to just go buy another unit from a different manufacturer, but then contacted Amazon first. 5 minutes later I got off the phone with a refund which I spent on a model 850. We''ll see how the second and third ones go. An extra star here for Amazon service!"
5,Super Shirt...Super Price,Just received the Grey color. Can't believe the fine quality at this price. Going back to buy the other colors now.
4,Chantal 2 qt saucepan,"I had an old Chantal 2 qt pan, but dropped it and it chipped pretty bad. I love the new replacement!"
1,WAY OUT OF DATE!!!!!!!,"The only review of this item liked it very much. Unfortunately, it didn't mention that it's 5+ years out of date. I thought that Yugoslavia didn't exist anymore and was surprised to see it in the index at about 5 or 6 places. (I wanted to find the new country(s)). Well! It does exist in this version. Why it is still offered when the revised edition has been published is a mystery to me."
4,BEAUTIFUL!,"This pendant is exceptionally pretty, but the picture does not do it justice. My mom will be receiving this for Christmas and it is such a lovely color."
3,author was witty but irritating.....,"i dont know what i expected but i didn't know it would be mostly the author tripping out on her husband & constantly complaining when he seemed to put up with her enormous issues....i purchased this book one week b4 my hysterectomy hoping the author who had the same ""tah"" surgery as i would be a great informant.....after getting past her irritable life syndrome i found a couple of interesting views on the surgery....much 2 pricey for all the drama u have 2 read thru 4 any substanance.....ok thats my opinion & i'm sticking with it..."
1,No sirve para nada,"Compre este articulo que primero no tiene tres páginas, sino que solo tiene 1 y no dice absolutamente nada util. No hay opcion para que me devuelvaan el dinero asi que me robaron 6 dolares."
1,Terrible,"What a boring read!The artwork is awful! What is up with the lines under Ivy's eyes and how many times did we have to see her stick her finger in her mouth?!?! That was so lame. Ivy is incredibly intelligent and quite the vixen, this book makes her look like a semi-retarded schoolgirl. And what was up with that Batmobile??? Terrible."
3,"Decent material, but not enough of it for the price","The first 90 pages of this book are the best. They include an overview of recycling and issues, then go into some detail how the various materials (metals, glass, papers, etc) are recycled and re-used. This section has many interesting collected factoids (""Today's average beverage bottle contains 30% recycled glass""), but they are not organized or synthesized into a coherent picture.The remainder of this 330-page book is padded with less-useful and boring reference material: recycling laws by state, recycling associations by state, and a list of references (books, articles, journals and web sites).Overall I think the price is steep for what is essentially a 90-page booklet.A more worthy book on (paper) recycling can be found in ""Recycled Papers: The Essential Guide"" by Claudia Thompson."
5,Fun Movie for Series my daughter Loves,Fun Movie for Series my daughter devotedly followed with characters she identifies with an loves. She was so happy that Bloom got a chance to see her family.
4,Great movie,"I loved watching the Winx Club on the TV, and I have watched this movie on the TV and loved it. So, when I found out that this movie was on DVD, and I wanted to get it. Also, I loved the fact that it had seven bonus episodes from the Winx Club: The Power of Believix which I loved watching it on TV. The only thing that I did not like is the size of the screen is on the small, and I wish that it could be bigger beside that I love it. I would recommend it to any one."
3,Good Movie,Ok it's a great movie with a really good ending but i just didnt like how they filmed it. They went all 3D on the winx so it looks so much differnt from what they looked like in series.
2,I previewed this first before I would share with my Daughter,"First, I'm a Dad that loves most anything animated. I found the Disney Fairy shows to be some of my favorites to watch with my Daughter due to the high quality and good story.I did not know much about the Winx series and had high expectations based on other reviews but was dissapointed. The animation was stiff, the story seemed targeted for very young girls and did not flow well. I lost interest very quickly. Maybe this movie assumes you have been watching the Winx series and character development was not needed.I also felt there was too much boy / girl relationships going on for the target audience. The story seemed more for very young girls but all the girls in the movie were dealing with their own boy friends (lots of pouting..etc). I'm going to just wait for the next Tinkerbell."
5,Love it!,Got it for our 5 year old daughter who's been waiting for this DVD. We both enjoy watching it. Thank you.
1,Not very good...,"If you want to listen to a real crooner, buy Harry Connick Jr. There is nothing special at all about this CD - save your money."
2,"Informative, but not very helpful.","The book provided some interesting information about toilet training, but none of the techniques were helpful for me. My daughter is showing signs of readiness to train, but the techniques are not for her. We can not use the ""Readiness approach"" because her bowel movement are not at the same time every day, she is too old for the ""Early approach"" though she is under 2 years old, and there is not enough information on the ""Rapid approach"", instead you are advised to buy another book to explain it in more detail. The first two approaches may be helpful to other parents if your child has regular bowel movements or is 3 to 15 months old."
5,Helped us succeed quickly!,"We found this book extremely helpful in getting our 3 and a half year old daughter to finally use the toilet for her bowel movements. After less than one week of practicing the ""desensitization"" method our daughter was successful. We also found the suggestions for bedwetting very informative and have relied on the appendix to further guide our research on this topic and to help us find retailers from which to purchase equipment to aid us in eliminating bedwetting. The book provides an excellent overview for different methods of toilet training and addresses age specific problems and offers age appropriate solutions."
4,Great!,"I feel like dancing when hearing this CD! However, I prefer by far the original version of ""AMERICAN LOVE"" by Rose LAURENS!"
1,Very disappointing!,This software was very disappointing to me. InfoUSA indicated to me that it was the replacement for thier 88 Million Households disc. That program had the capacity to search by address and this one does not. It is a real misconception and I could not achieve my goals with it.
5,bat 21,outstanding historical documentary. the author provided details on what deviated from the actual in order to describe certain events.Very helpful.
5,Hard to out down,"Being a Vietnam era grunt, I thouroughly enjoyed this even if some of it was a little fictionalized. I would like to see the movie now."
3,Entertaining Tale,"Allow me to quote the author, William C. Anderson, from Contemporary Authors NR - ""To paraphrase Mark Twain, truth is a very rare commodity and should be used sparingly. I subscribe totally to this view, and have seldom been accused of letting the facts interfere with a good story.""The author does tells the reader in the afterword that the book is based on the true story in 'spirit'. However the words ""Based on the True Story..."" usually mean a high degree of fact. If you're looking for an entertaining story written by a close friend of the main character, you've found the right book."
4,Review of kindle book BAT-21,This book is a really good read and gave a good sense of what it was like to beshot down in a conventional warfare situation.
4,A great book about storytelling forms...,"No book in the Universe will teach you how to write, or how to tell a story. The intention of this book is to compell the reader to think about many common places of the story telling in general, and the scriptwriting in particular, like structure, genres, etc. So don't expect any chewed prescription; be ready instead to bite on your own."
4,More good stuff!,"If you already have Volume I, you know what to expect from this series. Plenty of great pictures and excellent information regarding specific water requirements for all types of fish and plants. This volume seems to cover much larger fish than what an average aquarist might choose to keep."
4,4 stars -- minor gripes,"The book contains everything that I want to know about the Unix Sockets API. The book is well structured, and the explanations are generally good. I would give it 4 stars if it was possible.I do have a few minor gripes though. The text can be a bit dull compared to other books. I bought ""Programming with POSIX(R) Threads"" by David R. Butenhof at the same time, and this book is much more entertaining while still factual and correct.I dislike that all the examples in the book uses a special header defined in the Appendix. That makes it impossible to use snippets of code from the examples to make your own applications."
5,This is the one I have been looking for.,"If you are reading this review you probably are looking for a comprehensive text on socket programming. Look no further. This is the One. You can stop reading reviews trying to find the perfect one and go hit the Add To Shopping Cart button with confidence. Detailed, comprehensive and clear. A favorite."
5,Excellent,There is no word to express how GOOD this book.I really suggest for novice to buy this book and i GUARANTEE that you WILL BECOME A NETWORK MASTER.I've just finished reading this book and i use this book for my project and AMAZINGLY I'M ON MY WAY TO MASTER IT.
4,"Great book, while code exmp could be more straight forward","I bought this book about a month ago and used it very extensively for my UNIX programming project. While this book is great and very comprehensive, I did find code examples very confusing. As coping a variable from the socket struct into variable and then from this variable into custom structure, then manipulating this custom structure and finally printing. It would be better to use as less transformation as possible. Because it makes very hard to find what this variable has and where it came from. At the end all I'm looking for is simple but good example of how to use sockets...etc, it's not a C programming book."
3,Good book for its time,"Overall I think this is a good book, especially for giving one an overview behind the growth of Asia prior to the Asian Financial Crisis of 1997. I've spent a lot of time in the region both before, during and after the crisis, interacting with the region's business and government leaders. It's a daunting task for anyone to talk, let alone write a book, about such a dynamic and ever changing region. This book has done the job well."
4,A little light but still worth the money.,"First off I agree with other reviewers, if you are putting this outside be prepared for it to tip over in a strong wind. I had read those reviews but thought this would be great for an unheated sunroom in our house. We live in northern Wisconsin and can't wait to start growing plants but the last freeze often happens in May. The sunroom while helping being unheated often gets a little dicey.So what we did was set this up in our sunroom so we have a greenhouse a greenhouse kind of. I put a couple digital thermometers with memory out, one in the sunroom and one in the greenhouse and tested for a couple days. The greenhouse when closed kept the temperature about 8-10 degrees warmer than the sunroom temp, given an outside low temp of 28, the sunroom was down to the low 30's the greenhouse low was 38 one night and 40 another.Hope this idea helps some of you."
2,the plastic cover is not very good.,"I purchasrd this product in Sept. of 2012, and in less than four months later( in late Dec. of the same year )i notice the seam on the cover where plastic and fabric meet got separated,eventhough i was very, very careful every time i opened and closed the cover, and i used the cover maybe 3 or 4 times a week,the shalves seem to be solid but the cover is not good at all, would i buy it today? probably not."
4,Decent for starting plants or a patio greenhouse,You can't use it in Texas in the summer or fall or it will get so hot that it basically cooks whatever is inside. But.. that's not really the intended use so I can't complain about that. The only issue I have with it is that it will blow over in a high wind which is a pain to clean up. Just be sure you have it weighted down on the bottom or somehow anchored against the wind.
5,Bought Two!,"Bought as gifts for two gardeners and they did their starter plants in them this past spring! Result: Tomatoes, Tomatoes Tomatoes!!!!!"
4,A great reference tool on Japan,"I purchased this book at great cost but it has been worthwhile. It provides a concise overview of Japanese culture. It is the only book I have found to be so informative without the ""fluff"" of other books. I don't know about this one but the one I purchased is of fantastic high quality paper that makes such a small book rather heavy. A great book for anybodies reference library."
1,DO NOT USE THIS VENDOR,"This was a sub contractor to Amazon, who I really love doing business with. However when my order arrived, instead of getting white crew socks, I got black, shorty socks. Additionally, the 24 pack of black crew socks in the order were much smaller than I expected. I ordered size 5-9 and I wear a size 7-1/2. The socks were amazingly tight, and I couldn't wear them. The whole order was bad and there wasn't an easy way to return the order. I'll never order from this vendor again and will probably not order socks from Amazon again either."
2,Disapointment,"Did not perform very well. The intensity of the bulb is just too low. Also, not really related to the product, I found it a few weeks later at a local retailer for about 20 bucks."
1,dont get this,basically it does not work...we connected to the battery and it just flickered off on on. there must be something wrong with the connectors .it's like too week to hang on to the batteries . so the power doesn't go through and it will not stay lit.
1,Hope there's a good return policy. CRAP PRODUCT!,Got 3 of these and the 1st one just flickered. The second and third failed in a similar way before the night was over.
1,Underwater light,"Received late, broken, not properly packaged. Supplier sent RMA took a while to pick up and I am still waiting for my credit."
5,How to SURVIVE in an ANGRY world,"UNRESOVED ANGER is one of the MOST PREVELANT issues lingering in our churches!!!Dr. Brandt is a MASTER of SIMPLICITY and helps us identify and deal with this difficult problem lingering under the surface of what appears to be a calm sea.One of our experienced Pastors rejoiced when presented with this book, declaring that it dealt with the most often presented problem in the church.I am biased, for Henry was a personal friend for 40 years, and mentored and helped us through our teens difficult years.I buy these books in bulk and give them to others who gratefully report that they are the best!"
5,An amazing tool of transformation!,"I can't express enough joy with this book and it's revealing nature of my sin problem! I never even knew the burden I was carrying until it was lifted off of me and my sin was exposed to God's Word. The Lord has used these authors to help propel my family forward in it's walk with Him. It has helped us become better parents, better employees, and more knowledgable family members in the Body of Christ. Definately NOT a book I would resell here on Amazon. :) A heartfelt thank you to Dr. Skinner and Dr. Brandt!"
5,It gets down to the root of the matter,This books presents an incredible orientation of rooting down problems to sin. In presenting this perspective this other presents many facets of the human psyche that many writers of psychology have yet to address in the presentation of their literature. Recommended It!
5,Dr. Brandts best book!,"The best book for those who are tired of excuses and ready to deal with the problem ""Sin"". He was a great man and pioneer of using Gods word to help people deal with sin they were using psychology to explain and excuse. I know, I was one."
5,What a great find!,"Supper Swapping is fantastic! The recipes are quick, easy and delicious! I loved reading this book as it's well-written and witty too!"
3,A strong attack on exploitative labor practices,"I read ""No Sweat"" to research a term paper on sweatshop labor exploitation. It's a collection of essays by different authors, all on the topic of exploitation of garment industry workers. There's a decent amount of information in this book, and it's related in an entertaining style, but I have two complaints: the information is not very organized, and the book is one-sided and does not even try to explain the arguments business leaders use to defend their practices. Even if you are fervently anti-sweatshop, you need to know the pro-sweatshop arguments so that you can refute them.""No Sweat"" is a good start if you're interested in learning about the abuses of sweatshop labor, but if you want a more thorough, organized and balanced treatment of the subject, read ""The Sweatshop Quandary"", edited by Pamela Varley."
5,Great for camping!,"Well I recently went camping in a desert environment and needed something that would take less water to wash with. Whether you dilute an ounce of this Body Bath in 32 ounces of water to dip your wash cloth in or you wet your wash cloth and squirt the Body Wash directly onto the wash cloth, this stuff works great! It got me totally clean, no residue that I could notice, and my skin was soft with a nice scent afterward. I highly recommend this item for camping as well as for people that are looking for an alternative to the bath or shower."
5,Great Product,No Rinse Body Bath is a great product. My mother is 98 and we give her daily sponge baths. This product has made our lives a lot easier. Highly recommend No Rinse Body Bath.
2,"Not Exactly ""No Rinse""","I've use theNo-Rinse Shampoo - 16 ozon my boat for years and it is a very good product which requires no additional water and no rinsing. The ""No Rinse Body Bath"" is a little miss-leading. It does require warm water to dilute it down and then you use a sponge to bathe. (it does say this in the product description) You could do the same with a basin of soap and water. Also, I noticed a slight sticky film on my skin after towel drying which required rinsing off in the shower. I wanted to try it since I had good luck with the shampoo but I don't think I will be getting it again."
5,No Rinse Body Bath,I have been reordering this product for 1 year and wouldn't consider changeing products. It works very well and has a lovely scent. My husband's skin is very delicate because he is bed bound and he has had no skin irratations since using this product.
4,Good but...,"... you're required to use water unlike the shampoo. I did use this one day and it worked fine but I LOVE the shampoo that doesn't require water to work. Maybe the soap idea was too complicated to make that way.Anyhow, one less star because of having to use water. 4 stars because it's a great concept and works."
3,Not so great.,You do have to rinse it off. I really don't have any more to say about it. You could use any type of soap with water and not rinse it off. Why buy this?
4,Great Value and Very Easy to Install,"OK, I'll admit that I thought that the price on this was too good for it to be any good. But I'd been through several more expensive entry knobs that had failed on me over the years so when I saw the price on this, I thought I'd give it a try. I knew that Schlage was a good name, but I suspected these were some low end product. I'd paid about three to four times as much for hardware that was much harder to install and didn't work as well as I thought it should. This works as well as more expensive hardware. Admittedly, the metal feels somewhat thinner, but the mechanism works well, and it took me all of 5 minutes to install it in my pre-hung entry door. It worked perfectly the first time. Would def buy this brand again."
3,outdated,"I don't want to say too much about this book. I use it a lot. But I think what is in this book has been said so much more clearly elsewhere. I would rather attack econometrics using Greene's clarity or if I were interested in time-series, I would much rather have Hamilton. It is okay. It was a warhorse for its time. But unless you need it for a class, I think there are better references out there."
5,good night,"This pillow gave me a good night's sleep. I woke up in the same position I fell asleep in, no tossing, no turning. Its gussets give it a fancy, finished look. Elegant for the price."
5,"Loved by 4,5, and 6 year-olds","With over 50 games in our children's software collection, nothing comes close to the imaginative world of Creature's Playground. The game has a particularly simple theme: raise little creatures from an egg and take care of them. There are dozens of activities in an extensive little world. The graphics are fantastic, the play is creative and unconstrained, and is extremely well programmed (take it from me, I'm a programmer by trade). The ability to add parental controls (like maximum play time per day) keeps our five year old from playing this one all day!"
3,"Informational, but maybe not inspirational for teens","Each chapter has the same format: start with a question, discuss what some people think is the answer, contrast that with what the Catechism of the Catholic Church says (excerpts), discuss again what Catholics believe, and provide further inspiration. I really liked the secular history and Catholic history that is provided, for instance, the beliefs of Karl Marx and Sigmond Freud, the acts of courage by Catholics during WWII, the conversion of CS Lewis, the life of the prophet Isiah, and the history of some of the saints. The only trouble is that it doesn't seem to be written with teenagers in mind. I think it is more suited for adults. Also, I was surprised to find that in some chapters the same questions were asked as in earlier chapters, which makes me think there is room for improvement."
3,New Version Needed,"This book is very well done for the most part. It's one fatal flaw is the lack of a proper index. It could also use a refresh seeing as it is over 10 years old, and needs to appeal to teens today.If a new addition were published with a good index I would use it in any teen confirmation program."
3,Use of Teen Catechism to teach youth,The book is simple and straight forward. It is really a framework for a teacher to use to teach over 20 lessons. The material does require other material including several different Hymn books in order to deliver the full program. The lessons proceed in a logical fashion.
1,Just wasted time,"The book is very concerned about showing graphics where the defended approach/estrategies have been worked (what doesn't prove that it is a good strategy in a long run), but forgets to show the risk/reward graphics of the strategies defended.Not all the advantages defended in the approaches are real advantages or they are discrepancies in volatility very hard to find.The author don't stresses the disadvantages of each approach how he should, and described very shortly each approach (about two pages each).Tree of the six approaches recommended has unlimited risc and even the autor considers a very poor risk management for them, without to consider the possibility of gaps.For the articles, there are some interesting ones, but they are very repetitive and they often refers to graphs and tables who don't are present in the book. It sounds like they were put in the book without a criteria, just for give more volume for the book."
1,If you write options ONLY!,"This book was promoted heavily on different sites on the net, and I happened to be one of those who bought it!!!! To cut the story short, this book is not for amatuers! And not for ordinary regular option buyers (like me)!This book covers only:1. Futures trades (mainly).2. Option writing and spreads.But if you are not both of the above... forget this book!!! At the beginning of this book, you'll see how deeply the author discusses futures not stocks! And when you get to page number 47, you understand that this book is useless if you (like me) only buy options.I am not saying this book is good or now, how am I to know?!! I can't even test his methodology... but in my situation this book is of no use!"
2,This light is outdated,This light is obsolete. It was one of the first LED flashlights on the market. LED flashlights have improved immeasurably since this model made its debut.
1,The switch broke almost immediately.,"I got one of these because of the LED light. It was one of the first. However, after about 2 months of non-use the switch broke. It will not stay on and the only way to use it is to hold the switch down. Although it looks like metal it is just plastic. Better to buy a good light made of aluminum."
4,durable and cheap,I've had mine for 5 years with it being used often and I can say it is a fairly good light. Batteries will last longer with this flashlight than with normal flashlights. It is made of plastic but is extremely durable an d will last.
4,finally Juan Sequin gets credit,"Juan Seguin was a great Texas patriot and he is finally getting some credit for his activities, both assisting the colonists and with handling the government (Mexico). Good primary source."
5,Relaxin' at Krakow,"I am always listening to a lot of new music. And when there's a new ECM release I usually grab it immediately. That was the case with Trio. And I am glad. Here we have wonderful, inventive, relaxed trio playing by three very talented players. Young, creative guys I have seen at Blues Alley here in D.C. accompanying Tomasz Stanko. I think I may prefer the Trio to the Stanko group as I find Stanko's searing, sarchastic tone (reminding me of Prokofiev & Shostakovich) can wear me down a bit. Listening to Trio these past couple of weeks I have been reminded of an old-ish favorite of mine, Lyle Mays's Fictionary, with all its Bill Evans-isms. This is not a bad thing. Trio is a really rewarding new release. I will look forward to hearing more from these guys."
3,Damper control does not work effectively.,"I bought the Imperial Manufacturing RG2004 4-Inch by 10-Inch Floor Register because I wanted to control the air flow in a room. The product description says, ""Easy-to-operate damper control.""The damper lever is easy to move. However it does not adjust the air flow to a great degree. It simply and mostly goes open or shut when the furnace fan is operating. In other words, the register can be open or shut, but if you wish to have a slight air flow, to allow minimum heat into a room, this register does not have the control to do it. If the register is slightly open, the air flow from the furnace blows it shut. So it doesn't control the air flow."
5,You should read it more then once...,"This book is just another example of Gene Wolfe's prowess at taking the human soul, converting it into alphabetica, and then deciphering the jumble of letters until they spell out the very thing that contrived them. This book leaves you feeling like that. You need to read it more then once. The best thing is, you'll want to."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"This, as the title suggests, is not one novel, but three novellas, andthey are not all directly related. In the first, a story is set on anodd planet. Where are the colonists? Who are the colonists? Have theresident aliens become the colonists, being shapeshifters. The othersmay not be as interesting, but are equally odd and may have somethingin common thematically."
1,"Oh, please","A huge disappointment. Another ""serious"" sci-fi novel that makes everything opaque and tedious and intentionally baffling so no one will mistake it for ""kid-stuff"". This book says ""I'm literature, dammit!"" and attempts to prove it with lots of smoke and mirrors. Divided into three parts, each of which offers its own irritating aspects. Part one is the least annoying (that's not saying much). Part two is narrated in pseudo hippy-dippy Native American Cosmic-Speak. Part 3 is set mostly in a cartoonish, unintentional parody of a hellish prison, run by the evillest of evil evil-guys (including imperious slave owners who are often French- Haw!). Is this one guy actually an alien? Or is that guy? Have they themselves forgotten? Is this a meditation on identity? Oh, who gives a..."
4,Euro Trance,"These albums are different from the Circuit Grooves, Global Grooves, and DJ driven Circuit Sessions series. I like the vocals using well known popular singers, mostly female for some reason. I guess it takes a female to sing about love in any fashion that we'd all understand.The songs are mixed as indiviual pieces and a break occours between each song. This is fine by me and although not club style it gives the albums a traditional feel rather than a presen tation of a party one did not attend approach.I like the euro flavor of this mostly American music that this compelation presents. It is one of my personal favorites even though it is the only ""Mad about the boy"" album that I own. I've got nearly half a dozen CD's in each of the rest of the music series I previously mention. This one is unique. Check it out and see what you think."
2,The Kindle Version is Flawed,There is something wrong with the Kindle version of this book. It does not have a contents page with hyperlinks and there is no practical way to search through the book. Thus the whole thing (being a cookbook) becomes rather useless.
5,Miro the beuty,"This book is one that shows how Miro and maybye how people felt in that time period,which he lived so long.He made many beutyfull pictures and some that were just nonsense.I like his paintings so much i belive this book and him have inspiered me to be an artist one day.I am not very good but miro did not paint good but it was what he felt and that made him care and that is all that really matters."
5,We're Not in Kansas Anymore,"""Spiritual Practice, Occultism, and Extraterrestrial Intelligence"" by Judy Kennedy, is a book that combines esoteric psychology, eastern philosophy, and western wisdom in one information-packed volume. Where else can you find information on chakras, tarot cards, psychotronics, ufos and more in one book? For such ""far out"" subject matter, Kennedy presents it in a down to earth fashion."
2,facts?,"I can only speak to one of the mine explosions discussed in this book, the Burton Mine Explosion at Craigsville, WV in 1958. Many of Mr. Dillon's facts were wrong in that chapter. I'd think the names of the miners killed would be easy for him to obtain, yet some of them were wrong. Makes me wonder about the rest of the book."
5,"Fit the job, perfectly","Because I live over 40 miles from the nearest small town and 85 miles from the nearest shopping mall, Amazon is my source for many ""everyday"" type items which one might normally run to the corner hardware store to obtain. The product description and the product itself fit the job I needed to complete, perfectly."
3,Switch works but directions/wire diagram not included...,"This switch works fine for its intended purpose, however it does not include directions or anything with it. It came loose banging around in an amazon box. After some searching online I was able to find the diagram and make it work, however this is something that should be included with the switch. Especially for safety reasons."
3,Excellent toy but very poor construction...,"The educational value is great! My 23 months old daughter jumped on it and played with it right away. But, the construction is very poor. The edges are uneven like someone else mentioned and there's glue at places where it is not suppose to be and affect the aesthetic of the product. I truly believe that it should not me priced more than 15$ according to the construction and finish... I would have gave a 5 stars at that price..."
4,slightly annoyed.,"I do like this puzzle set, it teaches visual discrimination, and requires the kid to pay attention to what they are doing and where they are placing the items. However some of the pieces stick inside, and the holders that you grasp are kinda loose. But this seems to be only on the apple puzzle board."
1,Don't Buy this item,"I purchased an SC-FM1 radion in September 2005, it worked for about two months, than I could not get a siganl. I logged a defect ticket with Sirius radio assuring me that I would receive a replacement radio within 30 days. Well, its been over two months and counting. Sirius customer care says it may be several more months before I get a replacement radio. The product is bad, and the Sirius customer service is worse."
5,totally satisfied,I was very happy with this product. I use it all the time to make grilled cheese sandwiches and the ease of cleanup is incredible. If anything ever happens to this one I will be sure to buy another.
1,This item is not the one pictured and described,"If you want B and Decker CG41 4-in-1 as pictured, described, and commented on here, DO NOT ORDER THIS ITEM. The title, image, and description are for a different item than what you will receive.I contacted the seller/shipper, Books...., and they advised the item they are offering is a sandwich maker only, The Everyday Chef Sandwich Maker, and is black and silver, not white.I don't know how Amazon continues to make these kinds of errors. I find myself double-checking all the time to avoid receiving the wrong product and havng to return it. In today's job market, you would think they could find someone to do their job properly."
2,"Not Quick, Not Easy","Although some of the recipes sounded good, they are not the simple, basic foods that the title implies. Way too many recipes call for asparagus!"
4,Merlin,Why isn't Season One on Blu Ray?? I've been holding off buying the set anticipating but it has not come.
5,Love them all.,I had to have them all they was so good with so much magic and excitement can't wait to own the forth season.
5,A Wizard incomparable!,"I find the fantasy of the Merlin episodes fascinating. I shall collect them all for inclusion in my media library. Amazon had them to me exactly as promised & everything for my viewing pleasure, perfect."
4,Great Show,I love this program. I watched all three seasons in three days. I wish I could see episode 4 now. Sadly I've learned it is only available in the UK. I hope they bring this show to the US.
5,Merlin - First Season,"Video is of good quality and it is a joy to watch this charming and different look at Merlin, the young man. We look forward to upcoming seasons."
5,I Love This BBC Series,"I Love this Merlin Series, it is so well acted and filmed, The characters are totally believable. I wish the U.S. networks could make a t.v. drama as good as this one!!!"
2,Slow Paced...,Not one of my favorites...characters not very likable...series very slow placed... overall and could not even finish watching the series.
5,Supplement is outstanding,"This first season is a delight! The extra disc on making of the series is informative and captures exciting material. If you like the series, you will get so much more from the supplement."
5,Great show for the whole family,"We like the legend of King Arthur. This is a fabulous show and great new take on the beginning of Arthur and Merlin. Each show adds to the character depth and you can see how the experiences are changing Arthur and Merlin. They do not portray choices as simple black and white and mistakes are made with consequences. We find it interesting that both start out young as we are used to seeing Merlin (in other stories)as a much older. Our family watches this show together and first caught it on Scifi channel. I was quite happy to see Anthony Head (who we also loved as Giles) in a key role, albeit an imperfect king Uther. I personally like the fact that the female characters are also strong and not just damsels in distress.We bought the first season and will buy the second when available. I kind of wish it was available in blu-ray but it looks good on our large screen in it's regular format. We also enjoyed the special features."
5,Merlin - Season one,"The Merlin series is a fun way to escape into the world of kings, wizards and dragons without leaving your comfort of your home. It has some humor, romance and magic for all ages to enjoy. It was very interesting to find out that the shots and some of the scenes were filmed at Pierrefond, an existing castle in France. I can't wait for the season to start again on the SYFY channel."
4,Good Thing I was Bored that Sat. Night!,"I caught this show on a whim. I was at home on a Saturday night and flipped on BBC America. They are currently into the second series (that's a season Stateside) and I was immediately taken in. I proceeded to play ""catchup"" and enjoyed it so much that I broke down and decided to add this to my DVD collection!Now I am not claiming that this an artistic exercise of the highest order or anything, but Merlin makes for a straightforward, entertaining evening in. If you like your medieval adventures, fun light and relatively family-friendly, than this is the show for you."
5,THE BEST ON TV,"Channel surfing late one Friday night with only reality shows to watch (ugh), there it was, MERLIN!!!!!! I became totally enchanted. The superb actors bring to each and every scene that special something as they entwine themselves in their relationships. Its just awesome!!! I have gotton soooo many people hooked on this show. We NEVER want it to end. This show NEEDS to be on a main network station...it is just toooo darn good to show up here in the US on the SYFY channel at such a late hour. So if you actors are reading this, thank you so very much for bringing this fine show to this Grandma...I LOVE IT!"
2,Don't bother using Arthurian names...,"... because the characters have nearly nothing to do with Arthurian legend. Yes, Arthur is Uther's son, Merlin is a wizard, Morgaine is an enchantress, and maybe I forgot some other superficial similarities that this bears to the actual legend; apart from these, there is basically no similarity. I wish that they had just given the show and the characters different names so that people who are familiar with the legend (i.e., have read Morte d'Arthur, The Once and Future King, some of Marion Zimmer Bradley's wishful thinking/historical revisionism, and others) wouldn't find this so confusing and difficult to watch. As it is, I can hardly bear to watch it; it's as though someone wrote a book in which Palpatine was the emperor, Vader was his second-in-command, Luke was Vader's son, and Leia was Luke's sister, but it took place in the Doctor Who universe and the plot was something out of a Gareth Roberts book."
1,not as good as Legend of the Seeker,"I heard this show was similar, but it almost put me to sleep. Legend of the Seeker is far more entertaining for any magic & fantasy fan and the characters and the romances more likeable. Check it out!"
2,simple and sentimental,"This series is good for kids or young adults, as long as they have access to the more original arthurian legends to balance it out. The acting, directing, and writing are precious and overly sentimental and the retconning of the arthurian legend seems so unnecessary as to make one wonder why they didn't just create a whole brand new story with new characters and call it something else entirely. I'm disappointed that they made Arthur, Gwynn, Merlin, and Morgana all the same age. It's like watching Young Hercules with all that entailed. If you're a true fantasy fan, don't waste your time with this, especially if you like the more classical stories of Camelot and King Arthur."
4,Great show,"We've only watched one episode off the DVD so far, but it's a great show to watch with the kids. I have a 14 year old and an 11 year old - both boys - and they really enjoyed watching it with us. Quality was good."
5,amazing,"THIS IS THE MOST AMAZING SERIES I HAVE EVER SEEN. I don't own a TV and never watch anything that everyone's talking about. I discovered Merlin by accident and since then, I haven't been able to stop watching."
3,Ok for the price,"I bought this radio because I wanted an emergency weatherband backup radio and chose it primarily by price and the First Alert brand. You get what you pay for. The AM/FM part of the radio is fine. The local weatherband is hard to catch, there's lots of interference unless you hold the radio, antenna extended, in a certain way. (Even then the reception is not very clear.) However, one of the best features is it comes with an A/C adapter."
1,Terrible product!,"Should be zero stars in the review, but it will not accept 0.Very hard to insert the batteries, poor design and cheap materials.Weather channel selector is hard to work.The NOAA alerts are not received by the radio.Weather stations are not set correctly, you can hear bleeding from other weather channels.Would not recommend this item."
1,First Alert Portable AM-FM Emergency Alert Radio,"Cheap and would not buy again. Thought seriously about returning the radio but it worked outside. Does not work in our bedroom which is where we need the radio at night. The sticker that has the radio tuning stations on it is crooked inside the radio case so tuning is somewhat challenging. The instructions are not clear. I still do not know if the radio has to be on for the emergency alert to sound or if it comes on automatically when set to alert. Anybody know? Overall, try to find something with a little more quality."
1,Save your money,"Ordered this item thinking since it was First Alert that it would be good. I wanted a radio with weather. No so. Will not pick up any weather station on any band. Complete waste of time and money. Would return it but I threw the box away before I checked it. Yeah, I know, not very smart. That won't happen again. I went to Walmart and bought a Midland for less money. Do yourself a favor and get a Midland."
4,Goodplay,"You have to like the man to like his work, I see a message and good humor it is, see it for yourself and enjoy."
5,MADEA I CAN DO BAD ALL BY MYSELF,I LOVEEEEEEEE ALLLLL OF TYLER PERRY'S WORK. HE IS SUCH A GIFTED ARTIST FOR SUCH A TIME AS THIS.LOOK SO FORWARD TO THIS WEEKEND TO SEE HIS LATEST WORK. IF YOU NEVER SEEN HIS WORK. CHECK THIS ONE OUT. YOU WILL BE BLESSED.
5,Tyler Perry's I Can Do Bad All By Myself,"I have all of Tyler Perry's movies and plays, and I think this play will be very entertaining. No one does it better but Tyler Perry."
2,Purchased thinking they were movies.,"I purchased I Can Do Bad All By Myself, thought it was a movie. I don't care for the plays. I do enjoy the movies. I looked VERY carefully, did not find anything saying it was a play. Disapointed."
1,Madea,"We love Madea movies but ""I Can Do Bad All By Myself"" was not a hit. It wasn't what we thought it would be.I would suggest any of his other movies, but not this one. :("
1,one star for the price,these play's are funny but this price is just rediculous. REAL movies don't cost this much. lower the prices playa.
1,Doesnt work anymore,It worked the first time i played it and then after that it didnt work anymore. I dont know why but i kept trying and cleaned it and nothing worked
3,"Some good info, lots of typos","I turned to this book based on my experience with""Windows NT 4 Server Unleashed"", which let me bringan NT server up rather painlessly some years ago.However, this book does not measure up. Not only arethere many places where it's obvious that a proofreaderwas not used, but I found quite a few places wheretext was simply cut-and-pasted from chapter tochapter, resulting in duplication of whole paragraphs.Look elsewhere if you're looking to understand thedifferences between NT4 and W2K from the ground up.If you're already experienced with Win2K, perhapsyou'll find this a good reference, but it's not forbeginners."
4,"Very Nice; Convenient CD Player, Radio, Alarm Operation","This wonderful CD player/alarm clock allows you to either wake up to the CD in the player, the radio station of your choice, or a buzzer. The snooze button can be controlled to allow one-minute to thirty-minute snoozes. You can set two alarms, and it allows you to shut it off during the weekend without having to reset the alarm when the weekend's over. All in all, if you're looking for a good alarm clock with the added convenice of a cd player and radio, and don't want to put too big of a dent in your wallet, the CE-255 is an excellent choice.Below is the basic list of the good and bad things I, as a picky shopper, have noticed:PROS:-CD PLAYER/RADIO/BUZZER-BIG DIGITS-RESONABLY PRICEDCONS:-DOESN'T HAVE ""GRAD-U-WAKE"" (MEANING THE SOUND DOESN'T START OFF SOFT AND GRADUALLY GET LOUDER)-MANUAL TUNING, NOT DIGITAL"
4,It's a helpful,"Though I'm a chinese,I think its a good book for people to release their painful experience."
4,An excellent basic book on grief,"After losing my wife to cancer in late 2000, I've read several books dealing with grief and this is easily the one that I've recommended most. I've bought at least 5 copies for friends and family and have mentioned it in a few talks I've given. Mr. Deits' book has made this terrible ordeal a bit easier and much more predictable. It's practical, easy to read, and encourages you along the way."
4,Good grief,"Our culture tries to ignore this normal and important aspect of life, but this author offers some excellent and practical ways to navigate the uncharted waters of life after loss. Everyone who reads this book will benefit."
4,A very helpful and user friendly resource for anyone going through grief,"I am a psychotherapist with a specialty in grief and loss. I have also taught many all day workshops on this topic. This book provides very practical, understandable and concrete information for those undergoing a loss. Most folks do not understand the grief process and are frequently disturbed by their own reactions to a loss. This book helps validate that experience as well as act as a roadmap for the grief experience. It includes practical tools to move through the process and information not always covered in other grief literature, e.g., nutrition during grief. I have recommended it frequently to my clients and others as a very helpful tool. It is one of the most user-friendly of the grief books on the market."
5,"Entertaining plot,","High Stakes is a fun story with engaging characters I easily connect with. I, also, enjoy the humor intended in the plot. Nice job!"
4,Refreshingly Different Treatment To a Guitar Concerto Classic!,"Ever the innovator and experimenter, Miles Davis does it again and this time he tries his hand at a brilliant classical masterpiece that was originally composed for guitar by the late, great composer, Rodrigo for his friend the also late and great, Segovia. In fact, he does such a good job that you'd be forgiven for thinking that this was always meant to be a trumpet concerto. The other Spanish themed tracks are also very well interpreted making this a welcome change of project from what one is used to when it comes to Miles' music.This version of the album is also a treat for fans as the mini-lp replica sleeve design is very well executed and the mastering job is very well done for a very good sound quality making this album a very pleasant listening experience. Recommended."
2,the newer version much nicer,"i had to watch it coz of jack nicholson and coz i found out that the musical version of it is not really the original.had to see the original one.okay to watch but if you never saw the musical one with also steve martin in it, then get THAT one. the musical movie version is much more entertaining with great funny characters.so this one is not really worth a buy."
1,A Bad Review,"This movie needs better acting and special effects. It also needs color to make it more interesting. It wouldn't hurt for a better score or if it was longer to add detail. At the beginning, the narrator needs to put some expression into what he is saying and the actors need to do that over all. I actually think the best actor from this movie was the plant and the guy who ate flowers."
3,Little Shop of Horrors,Hilarious version....Jack Nicholson was priceless. Received product promptly and in excellent shape. Makes me yearn for black and white movies again.
4,Excellent version!! Awesome transfer of unique movie!!,"I own this Eureka region 2 version of the 1960 movie ""The Little Shop of Horrors"" and the video is very good quality!! I was so impressed with this version that I stopped looking for the definitive version.(I considered this good enough, and I'm pretty picky!!) The only reason I'm giving it 4 instead of 5 stars is because there are no extras. I just wanted to let people know. I don't write movie reviews on this site, but the movie is a very unique and funny early 60's classic and my previous attempts at finding a good version failed. If you're interested in my review of the movie look at IMDB under dwpollar."
4,Classic Nicholson,I bought this movie for my dad and he loved it. We both love Jack Nicholson and this was another outstanding performance by him. This is a truly remarkable film with lots of dark humor.
3,good movie: badly transfered,"I had origanlly seen this movie on a late night horror movie host and loved it having already seen the musical version. I bought the DVD expecting DVD quality. The transfer to DVD is bad. It's proably one of the worse ones I own. It's a little choppy, very grainy and somewhat blurry. There's also a spotlight effect once in awhile that I don't remember being there before (where the egdes of the movie are a little darker then the center). If you look carefully you can see waves going though the picture during the first part of chapter 2. The sound is a little muffled. I rate the transfer at 2 (I'm sure there's a worse one) and only gave it a 3 becasue of the movie it's self."
2,"Jack Nicholson is not ""the star"" o","I am a fan of Little Shop and purchased this DVD as a period piece. Viewers looking for Nicholson to star or even ""act"" in this DVD version will be very disappointed. He plays a minor role and his acting is no better than others in the cast (which is pretty disappointing). Perhaps I have missed something, but this DVD is not worth the price of admission."
3,Wrong movie reviewed,"Your review of Roger Corman's low-budget ""Little Shop of Horrors"" by James G. Mack actually reviews the musical version, made many years later. You need to correct that."
1,It is NOT in 3-D! It is a useless 3-D conversion!,"This is yet another example of ripping off fans of 3-D movies. Razor 3-D has released quite a few legitimate field-sequential 3-D titles, but they unfortunatley have also released 2-D movies that are supposedly converted to 3-D. THE CONVERSION PROCESS DOES NOT WORK! You cannot see any meaningful depth whatsoever! They did the same thing with some other movies, such as Night of the Living Dead, City Girls, etc. etc.IF YOU ARE BUYING BECAUSE YOU WANT TO SEE IT IN 3-D, FORGET IT! If you are satisfied with seeing it in 2-D, then you are fine. If you want to see real 3-D, you can do so with a field-sequential 3-D viewing system, but only use movies that were released to theaters in 3-D and then released on DVD in field-sequential 3-D. Some of the anaglyph movies (red/blue glasses) also work fairly well, but again, only if they were originally shot in 3-D. Quality varies widely. I would have given this review 0 stars if that option was available."
1,3D Little Shop of Horrors (2-D & 3-D Included),DO NOT buy this movie if you want to watch it in 3-D. one it doesnt come with glasses. which is ok for me as i own 2 different kind of glasses. the blue/red ones and the clear/grey ones. both those kinds DO NOT WORK! i guess you have to buy some 3-D special thing and special glasses to watch it in 3-D which i think runs like 100 dollars but not sure. so DO NOT BUY if you want to watch the 3-D version. what a joke they should post that you need to buy stuff to watch. glasses easy to get but to but special equiptment should be stated in the info as i would not have bought this knowing i could not watch in 3-D -_-;
4,"Fun, once you get past the camp","First off, this is NOT a good movie. It does NOT star Jack Nicholson, either (he has a very small, though very funny role). That said, it is really fun to watch. Although it's a bit hard to imagine, this is a horror-comedy. If you think about the plot, it is a horror movie, but it doesn't take itself seriously and you shouldn't think about the plot. It plays up it's campiness. This film is known for being the movie shot in two days. It's a wonderful example of low budget done not too badly. Little Shop of Horrors is entertaining, and its a must-see if you're a fan of the amazing musical, since you get a sense of how the production evolved. If you want a chilling movie or one that requires any mental work, this one can't begin to satisfy you. If you're willing to pay for a really fun movie which gives you a glimpse into the start of a great actor and a great musical, by all means buy this."
1,MORE GARBAGE FROM LEGEND!!!!!,"I was recently unfortunate enough to acquire 2 of Legend's colorized discs, Little Shop being one. Even though Little Shop was colorized(which is bad enough), I thought the so-called restored B/W version might be good to have. This so-called restored version had a major splice in dialogue in the scene where Jack Nicholson comes into the dentist's office. I have a dollar store version where that scene is intact. So much for Legend's restoration. This shows how little they think of their customers. The best thing all-around would be for Legend to be put out of business for this and their multilation of other films. Legend insults the consumer and the filmmakers with their colorization and editing of films. Legend=Rampant Incompetance."
5,A cheap--yet classic cult film!!,"There is nothing better than watching an original movie that was later re-made and comparing the two. Almost 9 out of 10 times the original is better, but NOT in this case...This was a great storyline, needed some brushing up but over all a cult classic. Despite the super-cheap filming and corny acting, it was complete (The chase scenes in the last part of the movie were TOTALLY uncalled for and looked as though kids made it.) After this B-movie was gone, the ever-so-lovely off-broadway version of this movie. All I can say is simply this: OUTSTANDING. Then the wonderful 1986 movie staring Rick Moranis...EXELLENT. So now every version is enjoyable and I just could watch it day in and day out. Buy every version today!"
2,"great movie, lousy copy","If you've never seen Little Shop but love humor on the edge, this is more than worth the money (though I bought the same copy from another source for a dollar less).But, if you love film, this copy is abysmal, not even close to Corman's original. There's dirt on the film, contrast is limited (though the movie is watchable) and detail is definitely compromised. It's recorded in VHS EP mode.Corman made some great films, this title is arguably the best of its genre, and I hate to think that the original may be lost or missing, and this is all we have left.It may have been shot in two days, but it was excellent B/W not so long ago."
4,Not the funny version,"I didn't realize there were other versions of ""Little Shop of Horrors."" This one is kind of creepy if your looking for the Rick Moranis version. This is an interesting movie to watch.I actually found myself drawn to the TV, because unlike the funny movie, this one have the 'old school' king of twists that make it confusing.It also has some of the same things (the dentist being fed to Audrey). You should just watch this movie, because it's not what you think it is."
5,The original is still the best,"This is the original black and white version, at least on one disk. Supposedly produced in just a few days near Los Angeles' Skid Row, the treat here is to see and hear the comic one liners, the outrageous accent and performance of the shop owner, and the 1st acting role for a certain now-famous actor.For me, definitely, turning this into a musical was a step back."
3,Haven't watched it yet - I think I goofed,I quick clicked when I saw it wanting to get some blu-rays and didn't realize it wasn't the one with Steve Martin. After receiving it and reading the outside it does look like it might be good but I should have read the info before I bought. I do love having different versions of movies and love Jack Nicholson - crossing my fingers and willing to change my rating after the viewing.Remember to do your homework - silly me.
3,Campy B Movie,If you like the movie with Rick Moranis this original is a must see. Extremely campy and done in two days makes it even more fun.
4,Feed Me!,One of Roger Corman's greats. The film was actually made within a period of 24 hours. Although the lack of production that went into the film never shows in this gem of a cult classic. Jack Nicholson early if not first film appearance. He's only on the screen for about 2 minutes playing a dental patient with a fetsih for pain. The film is much better than the musical remake that was done with Rick Morranis.
5,Crystal Woman: by Lynn Andrews,"I have most if not all of lynn's books and they are the most informative and interesting books I have ever had the Honor of reading. There is one book I do not have. That Is Crystal Woman. I work with crystals in my daily life I feel this book will help me on this journey of crystals and as always Lynn's books are always my favorite to read. Thank you, Michele"
2,Phew--a stinker,"I just read this series because I had picked up ""The Harrowing of Gwynnedd"" in a second-hand store and really enjoyed it. Boy, is it obvious that this was written by a much younger writer. The plot is interesting, the action fast-paced, but the writing is pretty awful. Let's face it, having the villain stand on a hill and shake his fist at the escaping hero is so cliched as to be embarrassing. Read it only to fill in the background for the other books."
3,a book of intregue,I love Katherine Kurtz's deryni novels. This one is the weakest of the Deryni Chronicles but it is necessary in the set up for the next book. I know lots of people hate that but I think she did a good job of trying to describe the events within the kingdom and what could be happening by those who threaten at the boarders. If you like historical type fiction and a bit of mystery and magic this book could fit the bill.I think Katherine's greatest talent is getting you to feel what the characters feel. I also think she does a great job of describing the social situation in her settings.
1,Dull,"I'm sorry to say that Deryni Checkmate is dreadfully dull.There are two subplots which do nothing to advance the story, the characters are flat, and the setting just doesn't make sense.I'd recommend skipping the series."
1,Cheap,"Sigh. I rarely comment on purchases like this, but in this case I have to. We're expecting our first child any day and are busily getting ready, which includes washing all the baby gear. I had to go online to a competing vendor to get some bottle washing apparatus and am looking for something else for the nipples, or else a more expensive (read: durable and effective) alternative to this ode to ineffectiveness. If you're going to spend $6.00 on this thing, considering how much $ and time go into dealing with the sheer volume of stuff to wash, do yourself a favor and spend a little more and get something, or a few things, that work -> are well-built -> and are not a hassle."
4,Faithful dishwasher basket,"I used this basket for years with my three children, without problem. Eventually after about four years, the top hinges broke loose, and while that wasn't ideal, it still worked by just placing the lid part on the basket. I can understand the first reviewer's comment about not fitting her choice of wider bottle nipples, but for standard parts, I think it's a solid choice and does what it advertises."
1,absolutely NOT strained! full of pieces! false description! beware!,"I bought this product because it stated under product description ""no need for straining"". They lied! it is not strained at all. Amazon had to refund me. Beware. This item must be strained! I would give zero stars if I could!"
