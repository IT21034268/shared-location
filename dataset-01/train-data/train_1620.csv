2,what's up?,I bought the item and the headphones are uneven. One side is much longer than the other and you can't change it to make them equal...unless you cut off the little plasic piece holding the wires together. I just wrote to the comapny who sold it to see if I could get another pair sent out
2,Headsets shouldn't hurt,The headset itself was nice. The features were good and it would do what it is intended for however I don't use use them. The headset hurts my ears. They are metal without any cushion and after a short time of use they made my ears sore. They aren't very secure either. If I were to sit still they would do the trick but you could not expect these headsets to stay in place while working out or running. I ended up purchasing a pair of earbuds for comfort.
2,good while it lasted,I got these headphones 2 days ago and already its broken. The ear buds only play music in one ear. They were working fine for one day and i tried them with many other headphones and they still don't work! Might as well just buy a different adapter!
2,Just OK - keep looking,Holy Crap do these earplugs make your ears hurt. worse than any I have ever used. Mic is ok if your sitting straight up and not moving. I say keep looking.
2,Short wires,"It gets the job done, however its very short because I can't get the volume adjuster part to even fit in my phone unfortunately. I guess that is my fault."
3,Good sound but cord lengh sucks.,I bought these for a LG LX600. You get good sound but the length of the wires is awful. Not only is one side longer than the other but if you keep the phone in your pocket the cords aren't long enough. And they really put a limit on the volume.
4,"Headphones Crap, Adapter and Mic are Spectacular","The headphones that are bundled with the adapter are garbage, they fall out constantly and have terrible sound quality. That being said, the price is worth the adapter alone and the mic is crystal clear when answering calls handsfree. If you have your own prefered quality headphones and need an adapter to be able to listen to music off your phone, I highly recommend this product."
3,It is not what it seems,"The head set earbuds on one side is way longer than the other which sucks but, it still works good. The package came in on time so you don't have to worry about it arriving late."
5,Very good headset,"Great sound quality for music & phone calls. I had this with an old phone and when I saw it on Amazon, I had to have another 1! My daughter hi-jacked the 1st one. . ."
2,LG Handsfree Stereo Headset,"I needed a new headset when I upgraded phones to the LG Rumor Touch. My old phone had a 2.5mm jack and the new Rumor touch has a 3.5mm jack. I could have gotten an adapter but that was basically the same price as many new headsets. I chose this product because the description specifically said ""For use on either 2.5mm or 3.5mm headset jacks"". Based on that product description, I concluded that an adapter came with the product...I was wrong. Now I have a new headset with the same 2.5mm plug that I already had with my old unit. The product works fine with other phones with the smaller jack, but I still can't use it with the Rumor Touch."
3,works great ok sound,I like this product for switching back and forth from music to phone calls...the sound quality however is just ok...but it does what it's supposed to do which makes it worth the money!
2,Topics are good,The information in this book is good at the original price - not the current price. I can get a lot of these topics elsewhere.
1,Not very impressive,"When first looking at the title of this book I was interested. However, now that I have looked at an excerpt of the book I find myself dissapointed. This book is a joke. The section I looked at was about using products on animals. However it provided ONE PAGE of information and it was basic ideas that were pretty obvious without the books help. Like the fact that some animals die? We all knew that. So it really had no help whatsoever. Do not buy this book unless you are interested in reading fifty topics with minimal information."
5,Great for beautiful cupcake,"love it from the first time I used it,everybody applauds with the beauty of the cupcake,that's what I imagined when I ordered this.I have some other ones, all lovely.Easy to use, easy to clean, don't hesitate any secondsif you love to bake cakes at home.The collection makes my breakfast table welcome and great success."
4,An excellent score!,"Do not let the fact that people hated the film discourage you from buying this score.The score is really gorgeous. It was most certainly the best thing about the film, it has a sense of drama, power, and tension. Klaus Badelt's score for ""The Time Machine"" is one of my favorite scores of all time. Don't think about those rough moments of the film, just buy this score.I can't imagine you being disapointed."
5,AWESOME!!!!!!!,really cool i love every song and Klaus badelt is a very good composer!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,WOW! Get this CD NOW!,"When I first heard his music through my ears at the menu of The Time Machine DVD I loved it, and have been in love with it ever since!! This is some quality music that allows you to ""chill out"". I listen to it almost everyday while I do my homework. Helps you relax and focus on important studies. Not only is it good for those times at home, but also for those long carides while you are stuck in traffic that seems like it will never end! This cd makes the time fly like you won't believe! (Ok, it doesn't make the time fly that fast but...)Overall, in my opinion this is a collection of one of the finest compositions ever!"
4,One of the years best!,"Excellent, fantastic score. The movie disappointed a lot of people but the music will not. The main theme is a very versatile one, and is at turns scholarly, passionate, nobly heroic, and triumphant, and Track 6 is an excellent example of this. That track alone is worth the price of the CD, in my opinion. Highly Recommended."
5,KLAUS BADELT,Superior and futuristic theme that perfectly matches this great remake of the classic H.G.Wells book and original movie produced in the 60's.
3,Once thought beautiful and original...,"...a listening of Jerry Goldsmith's score for The Edge, an earlier score, reveals that the beautiful music written for Time Machine's time travel sequence borrows very heavily from that earlier score. It's the same reaction when I listened to Zimmer's Gladiator after the first Pirates of the Caribbean score. I'll never say Time Machine's score should not be purchased and enjoyed, but the discovery of the original source of its most notable cues knocks it down several pegs in my estimation."
2,Music review,"I bought this soundtrack CD because of having watched a lot of reviews saying that this's an excellent CD and the composer was the one of the co-composers in Gladiator.I listened to the CD right after I've brought it home. Well, honestly, I couldn't find a piece of the music in which I felt like listening to Zimmer's work and neither did I find a memorable music. I didn't buy it earlier because this CD had been priced even more expensive than buying thru' amazon+delivery costs. But after I've listened to it.... I was so disappointed.I remember one said the piano solo in the beginning was so noble the I would definitely love it. I also remember one said the track 'MoXXX attack' was making one wanted to hit his head to the wall....... but I'm sorry. I couldn't feel none of it.Please be reminded that I'm a fan of Hans Zimmer and I have 17 soundtrack CDs composed by him in my 102 soundtrack collection."
4,Knocked off my Derby!!!,There is an expanded edition of this fine soundtrack floating around out there somewhere that features a total of 23 tracks. Worth seeking out as this release is missing so much...
5,Fantastic Album,"Even though the movie wasn't the best, this soundtrack was exceptional! I have listened to it over and over and can't get enough. If you like excellent movie scores than this soundtrack will not let you down!"
2,Very little flavor,"So far I've tried the gingerbread and the candy apple flavors and both left me disappointed. I couldn't taste much more than just black tea.The pouches are big though. So, if you like black tea and aren't looking for strongly flavored teas this is a good buy."
4,3 pieces,I just opened this and found out that it was in 3 pieces. No where in the description did it say that. My husband put it together and thinks it will be fine.
3,it just worth this low price~,"it just worth this low price~ if you want to buy a better one, you should give a higher price~"
3,"functional, not fancy","This garment is styled and functions more like a sweatshirt than a sweater. For $10, it is an OK value for very casual wear. I wouldn't wear it to work or a sitdown restaurant, though."
4,Pretty good,"I've had this one for almost a year now.What I like: Unlike many other bike lights (esp. the rear ones) there is NO WAY you could lose this one.What I dislike: I like my bike lights to blink. However, this one has so many options that it takes 5 pushes before you get there. And if you miss it or push too slow, you have to start from the beginning (rather than keep going in a cycle)."
1,Not what it appears on screen or description,"Bought this because I had gotten it in the grocery store and it said ""Light"" and I really enjoyed it but then was never able to find it again. Found the item here but when I received my order, it was not ""Light"". It was just the regular version - not low in fat - as both the bottle shows in the photograph and in the description of what you would get when ordering. I wrote to Amazon.com customer service and told them they need to change the picture and description but I see that they still haven't done it. I'm on an extremely low-fat diet and was disappointed not to have gotten what was described."
3,You get what you pay for!,"The looks and colors of the comforter are very nice, but the first week that I had it on my bed --- seams ripped on the fabric insert on the middle of the comforter. It would cost me more money to have it shipped back so I took it to the seamstress that I frequent for othr things. She said that it was a poor sewing job and that she could mend it. Apparently, the seams were not deep enough. I was not rough w/ it and realize that it was a deeply discounted item and this may be why!"
2,You get what you pay for.,"After having this comforter set for only a few weeks - it started to come apart at the seams. I had to get out my needle and thread to make repairs, only for it to happen again at another area. I am dissapointed, but I got what I paid for."
3,Beautiful but too small.,"This is a very high quality and great looking set, but I would recommend that you buy it for a full sized bed instead of a queen. I needs to be at least 4"" larger in both directions. No matter how I tug at it you can still see the sheet poking out from under the comforter. Perhaps if you don't have a deep pocket mattress it would be fine, but don't ignore this and other comments."
2,"Lots of typos, coding errors","There were so many code errors and typos in the first three chapters of this book that I stopped counting. There are numerous technical/factual errors throughout the book, and the code examples are rather simplistic. I see nothing ""advanced"" about this book. Wish I hadn't wasted my time with it."
2,Mediocre and misses lots of important details,"This is a mediocre little book that doesn't deserve shelf space in your library. Everything in it is also in the BOL. Also, it's not written terribly well. I'm no literary critic, but the writing is drab - very, very drab. Get the Gurus Guide to Transact-SQL - it's much better."
2,"Decent for beginners, but not for experts","I could see this book being helpful to the brand new beginner, but I don't think it's very useful for anyone else. I'm kind of in the middle somewhere between newbie and wizard (about 6 mos working with Sql Server) and didn't find much in the book to interest me. But it's been several months since I started with the product - maybe I've forgotten what it was really like. My advice: if you're a beginner, consider this book. If not, don't."
2,Lots and lots of errors,"If you like code that won't run out of the box, get this book. Many of the examples simply don't run. These are usually minor errors, but I don't think the book should have gotten into print with them.I spend a lot of time helping people solve T-SQL-related problems. When I was recommending this book (I've stopped doing that) about half the people who got it ran into these code bugs. The authors would do the world a big favor to correct these in a subsequent release of the book. For now, I advise people to stay away from this book. If you want the best T-SQL book out there, get Henderson's Guru's Guide to Transact-SQL."
1,Mediocre and not advanced in the least,"If this is advanced, I'm going to write my own book. Clearly I'm in the wrong business. This is a mediocre little book with nothing new to add to the body of knowledge out there on Tsql. The book does nothing to distinguish itself from the many other wanna-be's on the market. Theres no deep technical insight and no coding tricks that I haven't seen elsewhere."
1,Not worth the paper its printed upon,"Total waste of time. There must be an error or goof on every page. Worst code formatting I ever saw. On top of that, its pathetically bad writing. Returned mine Friday."
1,"Klunky language, shallow explanations, and buggy code","Not much to like about this book. Much of what's worth reading resembles the Books Online. I bought this expecting a wealth of useful info not in the BOL. I'm afraid it's not there. Couple that with klunky language (English is obviously a second language, with T-SQL third or fourth on the list) and lots of bugs in the code, and you have a book that's not worth buying."
1,Terrible book,"Gotta be the worst database book I ever read. Just terrible. Bad writing, silly examples, stupid topics. Total waste of money."
1,Pathetic paperweight,"If I could use one word to describe this book it would be: waste. What a waste of paper. What a waste of my time to read it. What a waste of opportunity on part of the authors. This book is absolutely the worst SQL Svr book on the market. Theres nothing in it that wasn't in other books before. It's so terribly written, I had to force myself to finish it. If I could give it zero stars, I would."
1,Lots of language problems,"This is one of those books where the authors obviously speak English as a second language. Grammatical errors and language misuse abound. I found the text difficult to read through and exceptionally boring and dry. It's no where near engaging. Also, there are a number of errors in the Tsql, so many, in fact, that I'd say the authors also have language problems with Tsql. Do yourself a favor and stay away from this book."
1,Not advanced - not written very well - pretty sloppy,Can't believe I actually bought this book. Gotta be one of the worst ones I ever laid down my own money on. Terrible piece of work. Examples don't run. Explanations don't make sense. Nothing very educational or helpful about any of it.
1,Complete waste of my time,"I don't know about you, but doing complex numbers in T-SQL doesn't interest me in the least, especially when the computations are inaccurate and incredibly slow. The whole book is a waste of time. We get to learn how Itzik's code formatting style differs from Tom's (who cares -- who the heck is either of these guys?) We get to learn how neat it is to run into someone with the same first name. And we get to hear about Itzik's martial arts master (really interesting stuff... not). I am returning this one for a refund."
2,Shallow to a fault,"One of the problems with a lot of computer books these days is that they try to cover a wide range of topics without _really_ delving into anything. This is one such book. It will tell you what a stored procedure is, how to code it, what some of the syntax is - the basics - without really going into the details. In other words, you won't learn anything from this book that you couldn't learn on your own in an afternoon with the Books Online and Query Analyzer. The SQL presented in this book is neither advanced nor SQL Server 2K specific, and I think you'd be wasting your money to buy it."
1,Get Henderson's book instead,"There is just one problem with ""Advanced Transact-SQL for SQL Server 2000"": it is not ""advanced"" in the slightest. Not atleast compared to Kenneth W. Henderson's ""The Guru's Guide to Transact-SQL"".I've been coding in the language for about 3 years now and didn't find a thing in it that I didn't already know. Henderson's book, OTOH, opened whole new worlds to me. Don't buy this book. Buy Henderson's book instead -- really, you'll thank me."
2,"Lots of typos, errors, and generally bad writing","I had a pretty bad experience with this book. There are numerous errors and typos in the book. I wrote the authors about these but have yet to receive a reply. Several of the example queries simply don't work. I also didn't think the book was written very well. Overly long sentences and $50 words seem to be a favorite of the authors. For example, I came across one doozie that was four and a half lines long. That's way too long for a single sentence. The book looks as though it hasn't yet been edited. Wouldn't waste my money if I were you..."
1,Stick with the Books Online,"Most of this book is little more than a rehash of the Books Online. If you need a print of the BOL, get this book. If instead you're looking for an advanced Transact-SQL book, don't get this book. It's not advanced in the least."
1,Got some language problems,"This book definitely has some language problems, and I don't mean English. Yes, it's obvious that neither of the authors are particularly fluent in English, but the biggest language deficiency is in Transact-SQL. These guys should not be writing books about Transact-SQL, they should be reading them. Lots of them. The code here is neither advanced nor specific to SQL Server 2000. It's beginner level code that's rife with errors in style, errors in formatting, errors in logic, and just plain errors. A real disappointment."
1,Not worth reading,"The book is a haphazard collection of bad advise and poorly written code. Obviously, neither of these guys has actually ever been a production level DBA. The book reads like a newsgroup message -- very amateurish and not advanced in the slightest."
2,Not advanced at all,"The problem, it seems to me, is that Henderson's The Guru's Guide to Transact-SQL has raised the bar on what exactly constitutes an advanced T-SQL book. Books like this would do well to take notice. The book has some good info at times, but it's not more advanced than, say, the docs that come with SQL Server.If the book were titled Transact-SQL for Beginners, maybe it would more fit the bill, I don't know. For my money, this book really wasn't worth the trouble. I'd say, maybe, 10% of it is useful to a T-SQL coder with any real experience."
2,Reads like a rehash of the Books Online,"The book is heavily influenced by the Books Online. You almost come away from it feeling that the BOL should get a co-author credit. It's far from Advanced if Advanced is defined by that which goes beyond the BOL. I can't think of any part of the book that stands out as really beyond the BOL. There's the nigh useless deviation into complex math in T-SQL (why not try some graphics routines while you're at it <g>), but there's nothing that says, ""Hey, look at me - I'll tell you something you could never learn from the BOL."" The book was really disappointing."
1,Techniques borrowed from other books,"Almost every technique I've seen in this book can be found in other books. I can't think of any off the top of my head that I haven't seen before. A good number of these are in Henderson's and Klein's books. I wouldn't waste my time with this one. Get the original source books, instead."
1,Too many holes,"This book has far too many holes. There's too much stuff left out. We spend all day talking about Itzik's coding style vs. Tom's, but we don't ever talk about statistical functions, star-schema joins, performance tuning, or the myriad other Transact-SQL related topics. Intead, this is a poorly done one-off of magazine articles that weren't that good in the first place..."
1,Repeat of the Books Online,This book consists entirely of repeats from the Books Online. It's a real disappointment. All the (useful) info in this one can be found with a couple clicks of the mouse in the BOL.
2,Not a COMPLETE waste of time,"I don't agree with the other review on here that says this book is a complete waste of time. There are a few bright spots here and there. If you're very new to SQL Server, you may find, say, 5% of the book to be useful and to pass on info that you won't find in the Books Online.However, I do agree that the narrative is pretty uneven at times. You can definitely tell that more than one person wrote this book (e.g., when you see completely different code formatting on the SAME page :-).I didn't get much out of the book myself, hence the two-star review. Then again, I'm an advanced SQL Server developer (MCDBA) who's been working with the product for about two years now. The book was definitely beneath me, but if you're just starting with SQL Server you might learn a few things from it."
2,Omits crucial info,"Would like to have seen coverage of all the new features in SS 2000. Instead, the coverage is hit and miss. There are also mistakes in many of the examples. I was expecting deep coverage of advanced Transact SQL, but this book doesn't deliver. If you're a complete beginner, it might offer something useful for you, but otherwise, I wouldn't bother."
2,Poorly written,"I bought this book one month ago. Finally, I have some time to sit down and read this book. After read a couple of charpters, I realized that I made a big mistake even spend time on this one. This book comes with a sounding title with unreadable material... If peopel do want to explore advanced T-SQL programming, take the ""The Guru Guide to Transact-SQL"" by Ken Handerson. It is one of the best SQL books in my collection. It is a bit out dated but it will bring you right into the point.Jim J. Zhong"
2,Disappointing,"I bought this one after I heard that a couple guys from the forums wrote it. What a disappointment!Not only is it not a very good book, I'm not sure much of it would make for a good newsgroup posting! The examples are frought with errors and bad advice. The code is inane and often useless from a practical standpoint.This is another one of those books that should never have been published.A real disappointment."
2,Not much to get excited about,"One thing to recognise - I get excited about good books. Unfortunately, there's nothing really to be excited about with this one. There are far too many errors and other gaffs to make this book worth any real excitement. Instead, it was a bit of a disappointment. I know of both of the authors, having seen them on the newsgroups sporadically, so I went out and purchased their book. That was a mistake, I'm afraid. Better stick to newsgroups, fellows."
1,A true disappointment,"When I heard that a couple of the guys that surf the SQL newsgroups were writing a book I thought ""this will be great."" I couldn't have been more wrong. This is a terrible book. There are so many errors that the code is nigh useless. It's also full of bad advice and things that should never be in a book. My respect for these two has gone down a couple of notches - I'll have to watch their advice on the newsgroups a little more closely."
1,Amateurish little hack of a book,"The best thing I can say about this book is that some of the code works. For the most part, it doesn't work. Worse yet, the book recommends techniques that Microsoft has deprecated (old style joins, for example) for some time now. There are lots of typos and coding bugs - enough that I wonder if the book was really edited. Definitely not my cup of tea. It's another one of those weighty door stops."
4,Value for price,Bought this BOSS audio system for my quest van and also bought te dash install kit and wiring harness . The installation was easy . Sounds ok with the existing speakers in the van. I feel the BASS is more with the existing speakers.Only thing disadvantage I see is i need to press a button always to display the time.
1,Jesse James Lite,"This is a superficial look at a well known figure. A friend had recomended it, but I found it uninformative and boring.It is a limp,ineffective attempt to cash in on a current movie. Dont waste your money on it."
4,Fit like a glove,"It was easy to replace the old with this. Everything just fit and worked. A 20 minute job, including washing your hands."
5,AngelGirl,"Am totally in love with the MacKade brothers, Jared's a little ridge at times but his fairness and warm heart shines through at the end."
2,More of the same,"These books are so predictable. She has a fun way of writing and can be entertaining, however I think she put out a lazy series this time just to make money. No thought was put into this book. I will not finish this series."
5,2nd book to the MacKade Brothers series,This is a great book I really like the character's in these books. These brothers are so much alike but still there own person. It makes you feel like you know them. Shane has been my favorite character in these books.
5,AWESOME BOOK!,These men are sexy and full of surprises. These books will surprises you. Rafe the bad boy and Jared the lawyer these two brothers are kind and gentle. The way Jared have his heart to Savannah and accepted her and her son just melted my heart.
4,Wonderfully Romantic,I love the way Nora Roberts builds in pertinent details along with the romance. We need more men like the MacKade brothers.
5,Nora roberts,I have always enjoyed Nora Roberts books and this one was no exception. Ofcourse you can imagine the outcome but she writes so well you are engrosed in novel. They are easy yo read and reread.Thankyou Nora Roberts
5,Addictive...,This was my favorite of the series! Classic Nora Roberts. The character development made me miss having the inside story of these two once the story moved on. Worth the read.
4,Nora does it again,"Not among my favorite Nora Roberts series, but even when she's not perfect, her books are a cut above! Nice read about people with good hearts."
5,MacKade Brothers,Nora Roberts is my next favorite author. Anything she rights is fantastic. This series about the brothers is so fantastic. It makes you want to have mini series done for each of them.
3,Originally published in mid-90s,"This is a good series in typical Norah Roberts fashion, but beware that they were first published by Silhouette in the mid-90s, so if you think it's new, you are being mislead."
3,this story has been told before,"I expected more from this series. When I read it I realized Ms Roberts had similar characters in a similar backround, dealing with similar issues in a series that starts with ""The Next Alawys"" . That 3 book set features the Montgomery brothers (only 3) and is set in Boonsboro NC (very close to Antitem). I love the Civil War ghosts and how they interact with the characters; however I felt the story was much better told in ""The Next Always"" and the two books following it. I am not sure which series she wrote first, but if you like this one you'll love that one"
4,Nora Roberts,I've become an active reader and if theirs one author I can't stop from getting my hands on is Nora Roberts's books. Their amazing.
4,The pride of Jared mackade,Love this book love all of her books. Nora Roberts never fails to write a wonderful story and even better seriea
5,Another awesome book by Nora!!!!!!,Nothing like love and family and dreams all coming together Happily Ever Afters ! This is book TWO in this trilogy and I already have the last two downloaded :) I would recommend these books and others by Nora . I.m definitely s fan of her style of writing .
5,The Pride of Jared MacKade,"I'm waiting for more in the series. Are there more books coming in this series. Please let me know, thanks."
5,Great Book,"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. The era the story takes place in, the characters and the action scenes are well- researched and described. Mr. Boren has written a tale that will hold your interest and keep the pages turning.I highly recommend it!"
4,"More of the same, but the same is sublime.","This is obviously for the Forbert completist, but if you like Dylan, Nesmith, Wilco, etc., you probably should be a Forbert completist! These are outtakes, live and alternate versions of Steve's acclaimed early work. One track stands out for me right away: ""Get That Vagabond Feeling"" is sublime lyrically, musically, vocally. It rolls along happily, like a hobo of Kerouac's ilk, living in the eternal moment. The rest supports the contention of many of Steve's fans that he is the most underrated troubadour of our time. Click on the samples-- and check his eponymous website!"
2,"""Reconditioned"" Vacuum","The handle was broken when I received it. The broken part was at the bottom of the box. The bagless container was full of dirt and lint. It looked like it had never been emptied. It was so dirty on the inside that I took the whole thing apart to clean it. I'm glad I did cause the power chord was not in the correct place at the bottom and after releasing the lock on the handle to use it several times it would have probably worn through and caused a fire. The vacuum itself it decent. It doesn't have enough power to vacuum a thick carpet but it will do on low carpet and hard wood floors. The products not bad. I think it does what it was designed to do but the ""reconditioning"" part was horrible. Wild chimps could have done a better job working on this."
5,An Instant Classic,I remembered watching this show as a 4th grader and the huge impact it had on my life! So I was extremely excited to find it on sale here. It is defintely a must -have for any parent wanting to teach their children about the civil rights movement through the lens of a great American leader. It prompts discussion and ultimately inspires. You will not be disappointed.
3,Good movie for the budget,"Wow, 'enhanced' means they gave us the widescreen version. And, Dolby Digital 2.0 Mono (Recorded in mono, but split to give the illusion of a stereo mix on home theater systems). There is also a commentary track with producer Paul Maslansky and actors Ian Ogilvy and Barbara Steele! Also includes a still gallery. Good job, Dark Sky Films, in the restoration to fuller glory of one of the movies I enjoyed as a kid. This is one of the better low budget horror films I enjoyed so much from that era."
3,Great Music- Not So Great Sound,"Sergio Mendes & Brasil 66 were a hot act in the 1960's... pumping out hit after hit of music with a enique Latin twist. All of the songs hold up well today... the music is still 100% enjoyable, in spite of the less than great recording quality. If you listen in your car it'll probably sound OK... but if you listen with higher quality music reproduction system, you'll hear the flaws; I took away a star due to the poor audio quality"
3,Good but too many covers,"This album has some great stuff and some not so great stuff. Mas Que Nada is probably my favoriate Sergio Mendes song. The main thing I don't like about this album is that there are a lot of covers of 60's pop songs. These covers are very interesting and well done but I think there are too many of them. I would have liked to see more stuff along the lines of Mas Que Nada and Pais Tropical. If you are really into bossa nova versions of classic pop covers, then this album is for you."
3,disappointed,"I am disappointed because I expected this to be better than Greatest HIts,it is not as good. Many tracks are from Greatest Hits many are not.The not good tracks I havent heard before probably because they wereunsuccessful.Greatest hits is non stop goodies , this is not."
2,"some refreshing sixties sounds, but...","I can't help but think of Mr. Mendes, Herb Alpert, and Jerry Moss meeting every night for dinner and drinks to discuss the future of Latin music in the U.S., various audiences ripe for Latin crossover, good people for Sergio to get to know, etc. There really is an undercurrent of business on this record, like the club/disco music unleashed by many folks a decade later. Still, much of it is enjoyable because it is so reminiscent of a certain period in the sixties.OK I guess I'm in the minority on this one."
5,Fine 60's Cheese,"Lots and lots of remakes, with a brazilian twist. If you are looking for serious musical talent you may want to look elsewhere, but if you are looking for alot of fun music at a good price look no further.Overall it is a good CD."
1,Poor transfer from original vinyl recording,"I love Beethoven's symphonies 2 & 6, but this recording is very poor. It is a transfer from an original vinyl recording and was not done well. The music is good, but the recording does not do it justice and interferes with the listening."
4,A rivetting good listen,"I first heard this album playing in a friends car, and I knew from the first few seconds that I was going to love it. The lyrics are meaningful and often thought provoking, but more importantly they are set to irresistable, powerful melodies which are guaranteed to have your head bobbing and your feet tapping. Vaguely reminiscent of The Offspring with a hint of Nirvana to my ears, but hard to classify exactly. I strongly reccommend buying it and forming your own opinions. You won't be disappointed."
4,"Short, sensible introduction to Buddhism","I've bought several copies of this book for friends and family who wonder why I find Buddhism appealing. There is almost no Buddhist jargon in the book, but the central ideas of Buddhism are set out in a straight-forward, cowboy logic sort of way. This book will be interesting and the ideas plausible to most pragmatic, rational-empiricist Americans, whether moderately religious or irreligious. Sadly, it will probably not find so welcoming a reception among fundamentalists in other religions, though its tone is respectful of other faiths. There is no sense that Rev. Macphillamy is proselytizing, though it is clear that he is committed to his practice. I recommend this book highly to any Buddhist practitioner who wants to reassure his loved ones he has not gone completely off the deep end."
3,Great new Feature,I am greatly impressed at the Amazon Unbox feature and found my missing Deep Sea Detectives episodes. Everything works great and I had no problems with truncated video like mentioned below. But don' tlike the fact that I cannot play on other portable media. Windows Plays for Sure is not a favorite of mine. Glad to see I could get a whole episode for $1.99. Keep em coming!
1,"""Could Be Better""","Based on twenty tears of Law Enforcement experience with one of the largest Police Departments in the United States, I found that this publication is more of a brochure introducing one to the subject as opposed to a complete overview of the subject.While the pictures of various aspects of the subject were excellent, I felt there was not enough written detail about the use of filters, night time photography and other facets of the subject too numerous to mention.I got the impression from seeing the advertisement pages in the rear of the book about the author's other products that these pages could have been put to better use with more technical information about the subject.In conclusion, it is my feeling that the book is over priced for the amount of information that is contained on its sixty odd pages."
5,Great little knife,"I've been carrying a Buck 305 for 35 years now. It's small enough to keep in your pocket without alarming anybody (except for TSA screeners.) it's handy for opening packages and letters, for tightening small screws, cutting wires and string, and all the other things you want a small penknife to do. I've bought several more of them over the years, but only because I've occasionally lost them--I've never broken one. Great little knife!"
5,Really Nice,"This is a very small and lightweight pocket knife. Very sturdy and well made. It's a knife you will be proud to carry. When others see it, their response is usually, ""Wow, that's a really nice pocket knife."""
4,Great starter book!,"This book was better than I expected. I was hoping for color photographs, but it has B&W only. Doesn't get into a lot of details, but covers quite a few topics on the subject of stone masonry. I agree with previous review. Would have been great if the section on Mortaring Stone could have been more detailed. All in all, a good starting book to refer to."
4,Manual labor is hard,"Chuck will keep you smiling as your read his books. They contain plenty of humorous stories while they display the stone arts. There are better guides but you should read as many as possible: you'll need it.Stone work is the hardest task you'll probably ever do in your life. If your project is big, it seems to never end and you'll doubt you'll ever finish. One rock can take 2 hours to lay whereas if all goes well, you can lay 5 in an hour. So, if you are interested in stone work, I'd advise to start small on the first few projects. This book is a good guide to helping you along the way."
5,A treasure,"This book is informative with good use of photos, which I expect in a book of this type. What else you get, is a really well written and entertaining book as well.The author is humorous and also a blacksmith among other things. He talks about doing things in the old ways with the help of modern contraptions where they will actually help.If you are interested in American History or primitive skills (not to mention building with stone) you should read this. It may even help make you a better person."
5,Comprehensive teachings on building with stone.,This book is an execellent manual for building in stone and offers sound reference to the engineering behind the construction principles. Highly recommended. The author is obviously passionate and philosophical about his craft which makes it a good read too!
4,Gift for Friend,"I bought this as a gift for a friend and he seemed to enjoy it. This book is difficult to find, and Amazon.com came thru with the goods."
2,Beauty is only skin deep...,"...but ugly goes straight to the bone, and this book is a literal example of both sides of that old aphorism. While the raw quantity and quality of photos are very good, the main substance of the book - teaching the Cheng form - is done poorly by the book model. The model displays poor posture in almost every photo, with a curved back (Tai Chi demands a straight back) and lack of precision in positioning of hands and feet. As a martial artist with moderate experience interested in learning Tai Chi, the sloppiness in form was very disappointing. Contrast this book with the expert and distinct posture and position of, say, Master Liang's book, and the technical errors are even more glaring.As it demands great self-control and awareness, Tai Chi is virtually impossible to learn well without a teacher, and this book will not help you in any case. To really learn good technique, find a solid teacher, and get a better book."
2,Bad technique but informative,"The photos in the book are very clear but that's a bad thing... The book presents bad technique and form. As a tae kwon do, wing chun, and with a months experience in tai chi, even I know that it has bad form. But, the book gives you a lot of information and teaches a lot."
3,The Steel Claw,"This is a pretty good movie, considering its story line. Anyway, having spent time in the PI and knowing history of WWII, it is a favorable representation of what may have happened (but it did not) given the circumstances back in 1942. I am glad to have this movie in my collection."
2,"""B"" Movie; ""D"" Transfer to DVD","I bought this because I liked George Montgomery in a western, 'Cripple Creek,' shown on cable TV. According to an online biography, he was a successful western and B-movie actor, went on to produce and direct some of his own films, including 'The Steel Claw,' and was Dinah Shore's original long-time husband.This action-adventure has a passable B-movie plot about a disabled marine on a one-man mission to rescue an officer in the early days of the Japanese invasion of the Phillipines, complete with several love interests and decent supporting character development. While the low-budget production values are hard to overlook, the biggest problem is the poor quality of the transfer to DVD. It looks as bad as many home movies.If you like this actor, marine corps or WWII stories, or just like to watch a character who never says die, then you could indulge in this bargain-priced DVD. Just don't expect a classic."
1,chopin/sverdlov,"This is a terribly disapointing recording. The young performer lacks maturity, sincerity, and energy. In fact, the performances are (seemingly unintentionally) pompous and narcissistic. The sixth prize winner at Queen Elizabeth clearly has technical gifts, but there is very little here worth listening to. It is surprising he won any prize at all, considering the self-congratulatory personality coming through. There is no overall direction, but lots of trivial rubati going on which ruin the beauty of the compositions."
3,"putters fragrance and then nothing... putters again, then nothing... repeat","This candle smells great of course. frank and myrrh is a fabulous combination. hard to screw it up. BUT when lighting this candle, you smell the frank and myrrh, then it seems like an unscented candle for the next five minutes, AND THEN you get the frank and myrrh back. It seems as if the oils used to perfume the candle didnt mix well with the soy was..?? i have no idea. I dont know the slightest thing about candle making but for the price i paid for this little guy, I'd like the fast burning candle to smell like frank and myrrh the entirety of it's lit life."
1,Not 100% Essential Oil!,"This product is advertised as 100% essential oil. When I opened the lid it smelled nothing like frankincense or myrrh. I turned it over to see the words ""fragrance oil"". This means they are using toxic fragrance oils and erroneously marketing their product as natural."
1,A Real Bummer,"I've enjoyed a number of Mr. Hogan's books in the past but I actually put this one down after 460 pages with only 65 pages to go. It seems to have every one-dimensional charactor and plot cliche you would expect to see in a bad SciFi book. All the scientists are good guys and all the politicians and media are bad guys (and of course they're conspiring together to hide the ""truth""). Although there was some interesting science it couldn't overcome a depressing and predictable plot. By the time the hero (a scientist, of course) realizes that he's been in love with his assistant all along you just wish they would both die and put us all out if our misery."
2,SciFi for the New Ager,"Hogan has done serious science fiction in the past. His science was good and his characters even better. Thus, its a disappointment to read ""Cradel of Saturn."" It could have been written by one of my Pyramid hugging, Astrologer friends.The characters are out of central casting, and have no depth. The theme is typical New Agey. Ie. Traditional scientists are naughty and unimaginative, but those willing to think imaginatively are right. The plot is predictable, and the ending clumsy and unbelieveable.Hogan has ignored so many basic scientific laws that it would be a waste of time to recount them. This is not that important a book.Every author has a bad book in him. This is Hogan's. I read it to the finish, but would not recommend it."
2,Disappointing,"After reading the reviews I had high hopes. It's hard to find good scifi authors. Found the book tedious. The characters are thin and the extraneous details are just that, extraneous. I would rate it as almost OK. Read Heinlein, Asimov, Stephenson, Gibson, or any of the many other genuinely good scifi authors, and give this one a pass."
3,"Excellent Story, Decent Writing","Though the formulas used in the story were transparent, the concept of the story was unique and refreshing. At first, I thought that Mr. Hogan was a ""new"" writer because his character and situation development wasn't that good at times. But he has published several novels. I did learn that he is Brittish, and I think this accounts for my initial perception. I have noticed that Amaricans tend to have a warmer writing style than the Brittish. This is not a bad thing, just a minor cultural difference.The book was interesting from the first chapter and stayed that way pretty steadily until about the last fifth of the story, when the climax began to build and continued to do so through the end of the story.Though the Sci-Fi in this book is solid, I would classify it as a cross-genre story. What the other genre is would be hard to say though. In short, I think that people who don't normally read Sci-Fi would enjoy this book just as true Sci-Fi fans will."
1,Cradle of Saturn is stillborn,"Science Fiction is, by the very title, supposed to have at least a bit of real science to it, and James Hogan usually lives up to that custom rather well. In this book, however, he disinters the hoariest of pseudoscience, that of Immanuel Velikovsy, who in a series of truly awful best-sellers several decades ago sent planets ricocheting around the solar system rather like billiard balls, thereby accounting for all sorts of ancient history. As a practicing geologist, I found ""Cradle of Saturn"" to violate everything we know to be true about earth history, and to be preachy and righteous about it to boot. I found I could not enjoy the story when the background was so profoundly antiscience and factually incorrect - suspension of disbelief was quite impossible. That said, if you can ignore or even ignore this outer fringe worldview, the story itself was gripping."
3,Does not fit all faces,"Wiley-X as a brand tends to slant their glasses in such a way that if you have higher wider cheekbones and a smaller flatter nose, the glasses will rest on your cheeks instead of where they properly should.Wiley-X glasses are made to fit classic caucasian face structure with deep-set eyes, high nose, and narrower cheeks. Everyone else (eg, asians) be very careful buying this brand."
2,not good,"Lens do not adjust so that they can also be used as sun glasses. Its not the fault of the seller, they were great! Wiley X just made a poor product."
5,Great product,This is a funny collection of SpongeBob I bought for our teenage son for Christmas. We all enjoy it! Delivery was prompt and the price was great!
3,Great Cartoon For All Ages!!!,"SpongeBob SquarePants is a funny, unique, entertaining, silly and at times unrealistically catchy! I bought this for my girlfriend and kids and we end up watching it together whenever the kids put it on.I would recommend this to the collection of the previous seasons of the show!DISC ONE:Fear of a Krabby PattyShell of a ManThe Lost MattressKrabs vs. PlanktonHave You Seen This Snail?Skill CraneGood NeighborSelling OutFunny PantsDISC TWO:Dunces and DragonsMermaidman & Barnacleboy VI -- The Motion PictureEnemy-In-LawPatrick SmartpantsSquidbob TentaclepantsKrusty TowersMrs. Puff, You're FiredGhost HostWishing You Well"
4,spongebob scores again,"Once again the season is great and full of laughs. Always clean and with some type of lesson based stories to learn from. Highly disappointed that the season was split in 2 separate dvds and the same price of the whole season the last 3 years, which doubles the price."
2,Spongbob without the funny,"I have been a huge fan of spongebob for a while and have bought all the seasons in DVD, including season 4 volume 1. The change in spongebob is drastic: animation is different, spongebob's voice has changed when there was nothing wrong with it, and patrick seems to be more critical of spongebob and less ""dumb"". The only characters that I don't notice a change is Mr. Krabs, Plankton and Squidward. I love spongebob but I recently sold my copy of season 4 and don't plan to continue my collection after season 3...very disappointing :(."
5,even for the new guys,My first job coming out of art school was working on an Avid system. After realizing that Avid's manuals left much to be desired I searched the net for a book about a non linear editing workflow with the Avid and I found it. Steve's book taught me how to be an Avid editor. I hope he writes more books on the subject but I'd like to see more broadcast technical books from him for those of us who need to fill in those odd gaps when you come into the broadcast field from the creative side of things and not the engineering side of it.
5,"If you are a serious Avid editor, read this book!!!","I don't usually give 5 stars but this was a very good book. It was extremely well organized. I have been edited on Avid for 4 years now, and this had some very cool new tricks to try.I will say that the edition I read (third edition) was a bit out dated. It is tough for print literature to keep up with the rapid changes in technology."
2,Pieces don't fit together well,"I liked the picture, but gave up on this puzzle quickly because of the way the pieces were cut. The cardboard is cut on a rather rough edge, so some pieces that DID go together had to be forced, and there were many that appeared to have a border side, but were middle pieces. Very random and annoying. Won't buy from this puzzle company again because of it, even though they have so many wonderful designs."
5,There is no such thing as a bad Del Amitri album.,"I heartily recommend every Del Amitri album. Justin Currie, the singer and main songwriter of Del Amitri has a new album in the can to be released soon. Check out myspace.com/justin currieI don't have any affiliation with the guy. I just think he is a very good songwriter with a great voice to boot."
5,"You'll get hooked, you'll get drugged","Never mind the fact that, as a songwriter, Justin Currie shames me constantly. This record is singularly spectacular. I continue to be stunned by songs like ""When You Were Young"", ""Surface of the Moon"", and ""As soon as the Tide Comes In"", just as I am stunned that ""Sometimes I Just Have To Say Your Name"" was not the most popular song of the last decade. From the first second to the final fade-out, this record is everything you could want and more. So buy it. [BTW, the name means ""from the womb"", although the translation is . . . ]"
5,Change Everything is one of my all-time favorite CDs.,"Longtime fans will love Change Everything, but it's also a great choice for anyone new to the band and its music.Intelligent track sequencing makes it nearly impossible to get bored with the CD, ensuring that listeners will get to hear the entire recording and not want to hit the stop button after 15 minutes of sleepy ballads or tooth-rattling guitar solos.Most importantly though, these guys are truly talented, both lyrically and musically. That's one asset many bands today seem to lack, and one that makes this CD thoroughly enjoyable.p.s. This CD has made MANY a morning commute on the Chicago expressways much more enjoyable."
4,Great value,"I have been wearing this watch for about a month. For the price, it's unbeatable. It looks great, it seems well-built, and it's keeping accurate time so far. Honestly, for a long time I have thought of Timex as low-price, low-value watches - disposable really. But Timex must have made some great improvements in recent years. This seems more like a high-quality watch at a rock bottom price. I recommend it!"
5,wrist watch,Good watch and ok price for this watch. Dependable and I would recommend this watch for everyday use. Second on of these watches. Older one still works.
4,long lasting,Classic looks and ease of use. My last one lasted 6 years.If this one is as good I will order another.
5,Nothing but dependable!,I owned the same style Timex for 8yrs before it died. I can't believe you pay so little for a watch that is so dependable. It also looks nice too. Who needs all those overpriced imposters - Timex is the real thing!
2,looses time,About one day a month it looses time (3' to 30') when I take it off and am sleeping. Other days it keeps perfect time. It's a little annoying to have to check it every morning to see that it's correct.
2,Liked it but it died,"I took this watch into the Caribbean, and in the course of a week it simply ceased to function. I was not diving, just body surfing in shore break and I am not used to devices as fragile as this. There is no visual damage to the device, it just appears to handle water exposure terribly"
4,My experience with Timex Expedition,"I got the Timex T44381 few days ago from Walmart because I didn't want to wait for shipping from AMZ. The watch looks very nice and works fine so far. The ""Indiglo"" night-light is a nice feature, but keep in mind that if you press the crown in to use this feature under water (when you are washing your hands, for instance,as it probably happened to another reviewer) the watch could be damage (see the user's manual). I'm giving it 4 stars because it is a bit loud and the leather strap is not very comfortable, but overall it is a good value for only $30."
2,"Nice, but unreliable...","This watch was a christmas gift to me. It has all the functionality I want in a watch: numeric dial, date, & indiglo - it's also light and looks nice.Unfortunately it lost the ability to keep accurate time ( it loses several hours/day even after replacing the battery?!?!?!) about a year after I got it. As others have mentioned, it also has a distinct tick with the seconds hand... I'm going to spend a little more to get a watch that works... without batteries!"
4,Great inexpensive watch,This is a great watch at this price point. This my second onethat i have purchased.
2,Misleading description,"This watch is not ""Midsize"". It is much larger than any midsize that you might imagine. Watches should be described in terms of diameter or length/width and shown in context with a person's arm."
1,Good value,"This is the second watch of this model I have owned. The first one lasted 5 years. It would have lasted longer but was accidentally broken by something no watch would survive. I have also owned Swiss Army watches. In my opinion, this watch is as good, actually has better features (indiglow) and is a fraction of the cost."
3,JENSEN JMC-600 - Disappointing to say the least!,"Although sleek looking, the Jensen name doesn't deliver here. My classical CDs don't sound full; in fact, rather hollow. The songs from the rock station that my kids listen to had good bass and more 'omph'. Getting the stereo set up is easy and the control buttons are not hard to figure out. However, to get most out of all the features (e.g. pre-programming a radio station), you would need to have the instruction manual opened before you and, even then, is complicated. P.S. Less than 6 months after removing the stereo from its box brand new, I report that the stereo is now dead (turns on but no sound)."
2,It has a personality of its own,I didn't expect to get a superb sound from it because of its price. But I was really disappointed with Jensen's quality control. It was fine the first year I bought it but now it had problems. The CD stopped playing after five to ten minutes and the funny thing was that I didn't use the timer or sleep feature. It was annoying. Can't wait to replace it and I certainly will not buy another Jensen product
3,Need larger one that is actually embossed,"I ordered the embossed one so that it could replace the smaller tip that my Borla system came with. It's nice to know that there is a quality exhaust system with the embossed tip. Anyway, gotta return it cuz it's not what it's supposed to be."
2,"More about so-called ""McCarthyism""","I think the evidence is pretty clear at this point that McCarthy was right on target with his accusations. Its amazing to me that liberals still cling to this ""McCarthyism"" myth. It just didn't exist. There was no repression of ordinary Americans in the 50s. Didn't happen. Sure, some people in government lost their jobs. But they were communists who then got other jobs selling insureance or whatever. Its not like they were sent to the gulag or anything."
4,lightweight,"These beaters are very well finished and are very easy to adjust in length and angle. For me who used to stomp for years on double DW beaters (felt side), it looked hi tech. I installed them on my trusted DW 5000. I was really surprised by the abscence of weight on my feet. My fills were confused at first, then I tried, practised and tried again, but in the end I could not get used to these. I adjusted some weights above or under, but I still was not comfortable. Maybe I would need the full Trick pedal system, I wonder. Anyway I am back to my old beaters, which by the way are not so heavy as Hoglan's for example."
5,"WALK BE SIDE ME,BE MY FRIEND BY:JOAN OPPENHIEMER","I picked up this book when I was in 6th grade. I bought it for a .25 cents. And placed it on my book shelf. Four years later, After finding out a book report was due for english in les the 2 weeks. I frantically raced to my small collection of odd books I have collected over the years. And pulled out Walk beside me, Be my friend. I read it in less then 2 day's. I could not put it down. I was such a wonderful expirence to read this book. After suggesting it to nearly everyonein the class of 2003, I came to Amazon.com to find out that, Probably my favorite book in the entire world was OUT OF PRINT! I think if it was put back on print, Many teens would find great comfort in it. Just as I did. Kodus to the author for writing such a wonderful book. And if she reads this. Thank you for changing my life."
3,It'd be better if it had an audio component,"Part of learning to use slang is understanding the tones, phrasing, and intonation. This book is wonderfully comprehensive in vocabulary, but Should have audio with the dialogs. Also, there just aren't enough exercises in the book to make it effective alone as a learning tool. If you have Spanish-speaking friends, then you'd be fine, but if you are studying independently you'll have to make up more exercises to do alone. I'd order Streetwise Spanish (Paperback edition with tapes) to learn ""Spanish beyond the classroom"" if you want to have audio. Otherwise this book may be okay for you."
3,Too many regionalisms (if that is a word),"Unfortunately there are a few too many regional colloquialisms. I was hoping to discover the structure of informal conversation, instead of a regional slang vocabulary.There is quite a bit of the former, but you have to tease out the regional slang in order to know whether it is something you can use."
4,works good for me,"I have used this card for my HP photo smart camera. It has served the purpose,i can shoot 250 pictures at good quality. I don't find any problems. It's better to buy a sealed SD card than the open box items. Look for 'Made in China'."
4,El tamaño sí importa,"Compré esta SD card para remplazar la compactflash card que tenía y en la que me gusta llevar mi música mp3 y wma. El tamaño, la hace una maravilla de la tecnología moderna, pues 256 MB en un espacio tan pequeño es realmente sorprendente. Sin embargo he notado que la música se escucha entrecortada en mi pocket-pc, y hasta se detiene. Como resultado he decidido que la SD-card la utilizaré para archivos diferentes a los de música y video, y seguiré con la compactflash para archivos musicales y de video."
3,Card corrupted with 200 photos on it,"My memory card corrupted after working wonderfully for a few weeks. My research into the cause provided me with the opportunity to buy recovery software but not much more in the way of help. My camera's manufacturer's website also gave insight into the problem, which leads me to believe that this is not an unusual occurance. Very frustrating!! Apparently it was caused by the way I handled my camera, unbenonst to me. My family has, however, used this same brand of disk without any problems. I have been using it in a 4MP Kodak camera."
3,Obsolete,"Used this on a Palm device. Both are now beyond obsolete, but Sandisk is still my favorite brand of portable storage card."
1,"Does not work, corrupts all files",I have not been able to get this product to work in my Treo 600. It corrupts all MP3 and XLS files so they are not usable. Sandisk is replacing the defective product so will have to see if the next one is better.
1,Stay away from this card!,"Even after reading the reviews in this forum I still bought one of these cards because the price was so good. I also thought that the problems were only with Palm products. They are not. I put the card into my RCA Lyra MP3 player, loaded songs onto the card, started playing one of those songs and the player shut down after about 40 seconds. After trying several songs and having the same result, I played songs from the internal memory and all worked fine. I tried this with many different songs and anytime I play a song that is stored on the card, the player just shuts itself off.BTW, this card was made in China.No matter how good the price is, heed the warnings in these reveiws and don't buy this card."
2,Get a Lexar,"If you search around on the Web (e.g., brighthand, pocketpc thoughts...) you'll see that quite a number of users have problems with Sandisk memory cards. They used to be the cheapest, but not any more. For the same price (or even lower), you can get much-better-quality memory cards from Lexar. I highly recommend Lexar for reliability, speed, and lower power consumption."
3,Only cheap memory,"Its only a little bit more expensive, so get the high speed card. You'll never regret it and you'll get rid of some of the pre-shooting and between pic delays."
2,Not thrilled with this item,"I bought this item for my Kyocera 7135 palm phone. Images don't fully load at all or if they do, it takes forever to happen. At first I thought it was just me and when I accidently reset the phone and installed all the images to my internal memory and it worked great! I transferred it to the card and it was back to being slow and now fully loading. I""m looking into another card now."
1,Problems using this card with IPAQ 1910,"Bought this for my new IPAQ 1910 Pocket PC- it seemed to work OK, until I tried copying/moving moderately large files (20mb). Then strange things started happening (system hangs & crashes, SD card reporting variable free space, unable to write to card, etc), and eventually the PDA would crash fully & require a full hard reset (deleting all user data and requiring a full system restore).Web searches indicate many people have had problems with their PDAs after installing this card. I went to the Sandisk site, but found no useful info, and they have not responded to my requests for info regarding warantee return or replacement. I have experienced this sort of failure 3 times in the past six weeks.)I would avoid Sandisk, and try another brand of SD Flash- I'm shopping for another (non-Sandisk) card, right now..."
5,"Great, but bigger is better","No, as amazon states your not saving $100 on this item, the price listed is a normal price for this size card. I bought this card only 1 year ago, and at that time it was twice as much money as it is now, therefore these memory cards get cheaper and cheaper, So if your not in a rush I would reccomend waiting a little longer, in any case you should always buy the largest card you can afford, as for this card itself it is extremely reliable and quality made, it has not once failed me, I use it mainly in my digital camera however I have used it in a cell phone, to tranfer pics taken with the cell to the computer. Great value, great price, great quality as Sandisk always is."
1,....Frustrated....,"Perhaps I received a defective SanDisk 256mb SD Card, but it operated very very slow with both my Viewsonic V35 and my laptop. It took 30 min to copy over a 16mb file. I've heard reports that it's read/write speed is supposed to be near 500kb/sec but the disk I got was barely pulling 10kb/sec, if even that. I plan on returning it and trying out a Panasonic 10mb/sec."
1,"Ouch, I got burned","I had to download a formatting tool for my pocket PC (dell axim) and every time I wanted new music on the card, I had to reformat it. Once I deleted anything, it was gone from the file system, but still took up the memory. A VERY flawed card. I have heard numerous complaints about this brand of 256MB cards."
1,NOT AVAILABLE IN UK,IT WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE TO ORDER THIS ITEM TODAY AND LET YOU KNOW WHAT I THOUGHT OF THE MEM CARD WHEN IT TURNED UP.BUT FOR SOME REASON YOU ALLOW UK CUSTOMERS TO DRIBBLE OVER THE PRODUCT AND THE COMPETITIVE PRICE BUT NOTE:- ONLY AVAILABLE IN THE U.S -- ERR !!
1,"""Nice"" shipping policy","Pointless system you have there, you can see products but can't ordes as they are available for US only.:("
2,Good but it has very slow writing performance!,"I've tried this card and it takes too long time to write a file. I using this card with my palm-T. Many other people facing the same problem. However, read operation take much less time to perform."
5,Seamless and versatile,"I bought this card for my Rio S50 MP3 player, where it worked like a champ. When I bought my daughter a Kodak digital camera, I popped it out of the Rio and into the camera where it worked just as well. Only problem is now I've got to buy more of them to feed my kids' SD-compatible toys. But at these prices, even that isn't so bad."
1,Died after little use,"I bought one of these to use in my digital camera because I have another card by SanDisk and that one has worked just fine for years. This one died after about 50 pictures. Now I have to go through all the hassle of getting a replacement and not know if that one will last or not. Very disappointed. My original card was made in Taiwan, this new, bad one was made in China."
1,Don't buy this product!!!!,"I just lost a bunch of photos on this card from our trip to Cambodia and Vietnam. I also have a 256 from Lexar and Panasonic. No problems with those. The photos were still on the SanDisk card when we returned home. I put it in the card reader and nothing came up. I tried again two days later, and got some puzzling information; put it back into the camera (Pentax Optio 550) and got a ""card not formatted"" message. Buy cheap, get cheap. WARNING - DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT. Unfortunately I couldn't give it zero or negative stars."
3,Would Not Format,I just returned my SanDisk for a replacement. The first one I received had problems formatting and then kept failing with errors when trying to copy content onto it. I hope the next one will be working. Great product if it works. I have a 128MB that works flawlessly.
4,Great Value,Searching for the best price vs. performance specs yields this item as an outstanding purchase.
1,Totally unreliable,"I have used this card in my Dell Axim since Feb. First some of the files I had stored on this kept spontaneously disappearing. I then found StorageTools - formatted this card. The file disappearance improved for next couple of weeks.Now a few times after switching on the Axim, I am asked if I want to format the SD card. I respond No but then find that all files stored on the card have disappeared anyway.I do not know about alternatives but this card is definitely money down the toilet."
3,"well, good or not depends on your luck","I first got one for my e310. it works flawless. never run into a problem. and then I bought another one for my Dell Axim 5, this time I got tons of issues.I tried to use the 2nd card in my e310, same thing,it doesn't work all right, keep getting me errors. hell, don't know how they do the quality control..bottom line:good price and works good if you get the right one.."
2,Sorely disappointed,"Having a good experience with my Palm, I thought this item would work great on my Pocket PC--well it did, up until I tried to get some data off it one morning. It was all gone: everything I thought would be safely backed up on the card. I was wrong. True, the Pocket PC is not, even in its latest incarnation as simple or as non-PC-like as the Palm--in fact there are _disk utilities_ that are available to help you do PC-like things to your disks. Unfortunately, non of them worked for me in this case."
5,Works great for me,This is one of the cheaper SD cards I had seen. I have had this card for about two years and it has never given me a problem to this day. I recommend this product
1,Shipping from BlueProton,"I place my original order on 10/19/08, with a promised delivery date of 10/23/08 to 10/28/08. I kept checking with the U.S. Post Office to try and ascertain where my order was in the shipping cycle. The Post Office was unable to help me. On 11/13/08,I wrote to Amazon.com to find out why I had not received my order. They in turn forwarded my message to BlueProton. I never received an answer from them. On 11/21/08,I again sent Amazon.com an e-mail stating that I still had not received my order. This time,I finally heard from BlueProton apologizing that my order had not been received and their promise to ship a replacement on 11/24/08 via Fedex. I finally received my order by USPS Priority Mail on 11/28/08. I am very hesitant in ordering anything in the future because of unacceptable practicesPanasonic 256 MB SD Memory Card RPSD256BU1Ain shipping products that have been ordered."
1,SAN DISK,The Sn Disk was of no benefit to me - I tossed them.I thought I was buying SD (Smart Disk). It is shaped identically butwon't go into my camera. I would assume the manufactor planned to sell a lot of SanDisk in error based on the similar name and shape. Stung one!
3,lots of space was slow,I bought this card for my KODAK C350 5 MP camera. This card holds over 200 pics on highest resolution. The serious flaw in this card is that it is extremely slow to save a picture to the card so you can only take about 3 pictures per minute. I personaly don't like this card very mch i strongly reconmend a sandisk memory card as sandisk is possibly the best memory card producer in the world right now. I intend to perchase a sandisk extremeIII 1GB memory card insted
5,Give Electric Memes a chance,"The Electric Meme is a superb book. It is fresh, original, deep and entertaining. Memeticists should be truly grateful to Aunger (Richard Dawkins first in line) for giving memes the only reality they can possibly have. I am not (yet) a meme-believer myself, but I totally share Aunger's statement that ""establishing whether memes exist is a scientific project of primary importance""(p.333). And I admire Aunger for saying ""I will accept the conclusion of this project either way: memes or no memes"". That's beautiful. From now on, if you want to talk about memes, pro or contra, you simply have to know what this book is saying. All that has been written so far is already pre-history."
2,Aunger gets ahead of himself,"This is rigorous and well researched, but it gets ahead of itself. To say that memes (or meme components) correspond to some sort of pattern in human brains is saying more than we know now about the correspondence between brain states and our thoughts and experiences. If we don't know this for one brain, then certainly we don't know how these analogous states can be replicated across brains. Ambitious work, but too soon."
3,good start...,"i urge you to check out Ian McFadyen's Mind Wars, an extension of memetics into 'tenetics'."
5,dangermouse,"Weeell - for my fellow yanks who have not been exposed to european classics, here is a great one in the comedic style of Monty Python, Bennie Hill and Pink Panther"
2,Not as good as I remember it being,"I loved this cartoon as a kid, but was disappointed after purchasing this set and watching a few of the episodes. There are many cartoons from your youth that can still be enjoyed when you are an adult, but this is not one of them. The animation is poor, even for its day, and the plots are really not all that amusing. It is certainly not what I would call horrible, or even bad, but maybe mediocre at best. If you are looking for a funny and enjoyable cartoon, even for adults, from the 70s/80s era, I would recommend the Pink Panther and Inspector Clousseau cartoons...they are still great to watch after all of these years."
2,I used to like this show,"And I still might, except they took the totality of each episode and just ran them one after the other. I don't need or want the introduction song and beginning and ending credits for EVERY 5 minute episode! It made the whole thing unbearable after 3 episodes. It's still funny English satire comedy, but neither myself or my niece and nephew wanted to continue watching when it felt like we were spinning our wheels and barely getting anywhere. Being used to full length Disney and Pixar features might have ruined us, but this series would be much better if it ran the credits and then the entire multi-episode story arc, and then credits. I can't advise anybody to get this."
3,Pair Records made a BIG mistake!,"Not only the poor packaging will frustrate any Phyllis Hyman fan and collector. The worst thing is that the song ""Valentine Love"" - the reason for collectors to buy this compilation - is NOT sung by Phyllis Hyman!! It is a Michael Henderson & Jean Carne duet!! I have no idea how the staff at Pair Records can made such a big mistake!The music selection is great - but that was an easy job because you cannot find a bad song by Phyllis Hyman."
1,SIIG with Drobo,"The MS windows drivers for this card blue screen the server (2003 R2). I was attempting to use this with a Drobo storage device using Firewire 800. After 2 month with Drobo support and after speaking to the Drobo product manager, I fell back to USB. I retired this card and took the hit. I do not recommend this card since available drivers are totally unstable in a Windows environment."
4,almost five stars....,"This album is wonderful for social consciousness. ""They Dance Alone (Cueca Solo)"" is particularly poignant given the current situation of the U.S. supporting violence in Colombia.There are many references to mothers in this album. ""safe as mother's milk"" ""lying in a mother's arms"" and so forth. This is because the album is in memory of Sting's mother.The cover of ""Little Wing"" is fantastically beautiful (I like it better than Jimi Hendrix's original), ""The Secret Marriage"" is a tiny gem of goodness, and ""Fragile"" is a deeply satisfying song, also relevant in today's times of uncertainty and violence.Some of the songs, like ""Rock Steady"" and ""We'll Be Together,"" are kind of silly and fun for a couple of listens, but get annoying fast. I would have given this album 5 stars except that it just isn't quite as good as a couple of the later ones. Still, this is DEFINITELY worth buying and listening to on a rainy day."
4,Little Wingers,"If ""Little Wing"" was the only song on this record, that would be reason enough to own it. Sting's version of ""Little Wing"" is perfectly constructed and performed by all of the musicians. As always, Sting surrounds himself with some of the best (and compatable) musicians in the world. The record could do without songs like ""Rock Steady"" but this is one of those records that every Sting lover should own."
4,Most Ambitious of the Solo Albums,"Stings best and most ambitious solo album. Fragile, They Dance Alone (Gueca Sola), History Will Teach Us Nothing include chilling lyrics; lessons being taught by the ex-teacher. A very ecclectic sound with threads of Urban and South American influences weaved through his accomplished ""new jazz"" sound. The band is tight and the production value is excellent. If Dream of the Blue Turtles was Sting breaking out from the Police, Nothing..., Sting's sophomore effort is Sting growing up and taking notice of the world around him. If you want a Sting solo CD, it's this or Ten Summoner's Tale."
4,An intriguing album,"This is one of those rare albums that you can either concentrate on or just put it on while you're doing your baking. On here, Sting's musical experimentation actually has a point to it; ""Straight To My Heart"" is totally MADE by the odd meter and instrumentation. I think this is his most diverse album... every song, really, is different. But they're all very good. My faves: ""The Lazarus Heart,"" ""Be Still my Beating Heart,"" and ""The Secret Marriage."" NOTHING LIKE THE SUN might take a time or two to get in your head, but I have a new favorite song every time I listen to the album. The only down spot is ""We'll Be Together,"" just because it foreshadows a trend towards facile songwriting, but maybe you think it's great! That's the kind of album it is."
5,One of Sting's best,"This album might have been a little underrated when it came out; Sting had written and recorded so much music that it had to be released as a double album (remember those vinyl days?). If you compare it as a double album to rock epics like The White Album and Quadrophenia, no, it doesn't match up. But if you're looking for 55 minutes of well composed and well performed music (it's pretty much the same band for Sting's first solo effort, Dream of the Blue Turtles, so it's among the best group of musicians ever to work together in pop), this should get five stars. I know Sting backed off from the lightweight single ""We'll Be Together,"" but ""Englishman in New York,"" ""Be Still My Beating Heart,"" ""Straight to My Heart,"" ""Rock Steady,"" ""Little Wing,"" and still arresting ""Fragile"" show a range and quality heard only in the best albums. I'm just glad I don't have to flip four sides of vinyl to hear it all now."
5,Nothing Like The Sun,"Producers include: Sting, Bryan Loren. Engineers include: Neil Dorfsman, Paul McKenna. Recorded at Air Studios, Montserrat. Includes liner notes by Sting. Sting's double-length follow-up to his solo debut DREAMS OF THE BLUE TURTLE is very much in the same sophisticated, adult pop vein, although darker and less jazzy (notwithstanding a collaboration with Miles Davis's arranger Gil Evans on a cover of Jimi Hendrix's ""Little Wing""). The songs are a generally varied lot, ranging from a tribute to victims of repression in Argentina (""They Dance Alone"") to a tongue-in-cheek, sort-of-reggae tribute to famous eccentric Quentin Crisp (""An Englishman in New York""). The sort-of-funk ""We'll Be Together""(originally written for a Japanese beer commercial) is the most upbeat and pop-ish thing here, and was deservedly a hit single, although Sting now disdains it."
3,Quite impressive.,"There's some really good material on ...Nothing like the Sun. I find this album to be a bit better than the previous one. The album's musicianship, songwriting, and production are all better than good. This disc is in a pop direction. ""Little Wing,"" ""Sister Moon,"" ""Fragile,"" and ""Be Still My Beating Heart,"" are my favorite tunes. These four songs are very smooth and talented in their delivery. The rest of the tracks are likeable, too. Sting does well with the vocals throughout. The comments that he makes about the individual songs in the liner notes are cool and informative. The lyrics are also included. Sting did quite an impressive job with ...Nothing like the Sun. I actually give it 3.5 stars. It's well worth a listen."
3,Decent CD,I love Sting but there were only a couple of songs I really liked in the CD; but maybe I didn't do it justice by listening to the whole thing often enough. Usually songs will grow on me over time.
3,Partly cloudy,"3 1/2Another stab at world-widening pop from a less embarrassing solo career than many, NLTS nonetheless feels more dated than its predecessor. It does include a few of his best songs yet, but just witnessing how the sublime and timeless ""Fragile"" can segue into the bombastic overproduction of ""We'll Be Together"" shows the artist still in the midst of achieving artistic equilibrium."
3,seixes and sevens? More like twos and threes,"OK so it's not that bad. It's just not good. Tristania's Beyod the Veil is much better. This album just didn;t do it for me. Seriously, all the songs sound too similar to hear any major difference. This album is why people these days think that goths are melodramatic."
2,good? huh?,"I am confused by all of the positive reviews. I like tamales but am way too lazy to make them, so I tried these from a can. Maybe I like spicy food too much because I found these rather bland and didn't enjoy the sauce. I cooked them in the microwave, maybe that was my mistake. I actually ate one and threw the rest in the garbage. I am giving 2 stars because they are edible but I wouldn't call them ""good"" by a long shot."
1,You call this crap edible?,"Guh, this was a horrid experience. I bought 3 cans of this at the local market because it looked good on the can and they were on sale. I finally got got hungry and opened one, and found that they were wrapped in some sort of wrap, making it a real messy experience.Finally nuked them for the required time, sat down, and had a bite.I could not even make it through 2 of these turds wrapped in a mushy blanket before I finally fed it to the dog. And to think I have two more cans of this crap sitting in my cupboard. If anyone wants 'em, you can have 'em.I suppose they could make a good menu item in any prison for the guy in solitary confinement and they want to torture him, or send a case to some starving kid in Ethiopia who will appreciate it.Would I recommend this product? Sure, but not to anyone I want to have remain as friends.Horrible experience. I've eaten better tasting food from a dumpster. No thanks, I'll pass with this one."
1,MIssing Order,"Hormel Beef Tamales , in Chili Suce,15 ounces Units (pak of 12)I did not recieve this order, PLease check and advise remedy to Recieve my order."
2,so-so,"if the 5star rating is as a bell curve, and 3 = average; then these are a 2, just below average. in grading systems around a c minus.they are not bad, but then they are not good either. hormel is not a mexcan food company and must consider the masses they sell to. this product is geared for the masses, bland on the mexican taste side of cuisine.the tomales are individually wrapped to prevent sticking to one another; hence not too hard to figure out the corn tamale is on the mushy side of the chart. the innards...well, as the old commercial went...'where's the beef?' this product is nearly all about the corn meal tamale and not about the minuscule insides.we bought just to check them out. we will eat them, but will not order any further."
3,Gently Cook & Hit it with Tabasco,"This stuff is Ok.Nothing great. Adequate on its best day.Do not be shocked if Hormel pulls this item from their offerings.I cannot see this stuff moving much.It's Not Bad. It just isn't anything special. It's the kind of bland you get from on sale, no name foodstuffs, never from a brand name item."
2,Not quite as good as I thought,I was hoping this was something similar to what I grew up with but it isn't quite as good as I thought it would be. The delivery was fine and the product is okay but you have to make it with other things and not just eat it by itself.
2,no one liked this item,"Just couldn't get any taste buds going, sorry will not buy again...........quick ship..........even the dogs turned their noses to it ?"
4,"These are great, though occasional packaging issues","Love these... I used to eat Hormel tamales frequently when I was a kid, and recently rediscovered them. The only problem I'm encountering is that a few cans out of the case of 12 will contain a ""demolished"" tamale, like the machines that package this product were off-target a bit."
2,Knowing what to expect,"When you purchase canned tomatoes, you do not expect to find a plump, juicy intact tomato like you would purchase in the produce aisle. So, expecting these tamales to equate to fresh or home-made tamales is just not realistic. The texture of these tamales is soft, perhaps ""mushy"", and more add a hint of tamale flavor rather than being what you may be thinking in terms of a traditional tamale.If you are like me and crave a tamale from time to time, these may provide a bit of instant gratification. But, I think it is better to be realistic in your expectations, than to be disappointed because of them."
2,Reduce Risk by... putting your money in the bank?,"This book is mainly for those who are extremely afraid of risking money in individual stocks or smaller kids (<12) The only stocks he likes are index funds. Otherwise, its CDs or something having to do with the bank. The author is ultra-concerned about risk, and he's 13 years old. His ultra-concern about risk gets very annoying and repetitive after you've read 50 pages.This is a great book for small kids, who aren't ready to take on the more risky stock market and individual stocks- it shows you the other options. (like the bank!) But for everyone 14+, I recommend ""The Neatest Little Guide to Stock Market Investing"".(I'm 15 years old)"
2,Disappointed by theme developed inTeenage Investor,"Purchased Teenage Investor for my grandchildren but decided not to give it to them. While the book gives a reasonable survey of the stock market it promotes the negative theme throughout that we, average investors, cannot succeed and would be better off buying mutual funds. (So, why write a book about investing?)This boy-writer (in my opinion) must have garnered a lot of help from dad, a lawyer, an accountant, a broker, a writer, and an editor. I read the whole book hoping to find something that read as if a teenager actually contributed, but I couldn't find it."
4,Cute,"These are as described, small enough and deep enough, I use them for soy sauce when having sushi and do their job in style."
4,Relaxing and Fun!,"I am the premiere Barbara Delinsky fan - and she was fabulous as always. I enjoyed Tess Gerritsen's story; but I LOVED the Linda Howard story, Midnight Rainbow. Haven't read Howard in years, but have already put in an order for more! Read and enjoy! Great combination of stories."
2,No Fill in this pillow,I would not recommend. They didn't put many beads in the pillow so it's mostly material only. I was very disappointed.
4,CYNDI is EXCELLENT!!!!!!!!!!,"Love this concert my favorite is CYNDI LAUPER- ""Another Brick In The Wall pt.2"", her vocals sound beautiful and amazing.Which is th main reason I buaght the CD & DVD.I also love ""TIDE IS TURNING"" and JONI MITCHELL, Well done concert!"
1,one of the worst live cds,"How can anyone even give this thing one star? ever heard of Live in the FLesh? one of the best live cd's EVER? from anyone? this thing flat blows, you can hardly hear it, it sounds like it was recorded from some bootlegger in the back row. and none of the songs mesh for beans. just a flat out waste of payola. The Flesh, the one and only. waiting for the new tours output of a cd/dvd hope its as good as FLesh but I dunno Doyle pretty much about stole the show in FLesh and he is not playing guitar on current tour. but the ladies are singing backup again so hoping for the best!"
3,"Scary diseases, dense read","Ranger and Slack's book has a lot of interesting material, but most people will be put off by the writing. It is written by academics for academics and is not as readable as, say, Kolata's Flu. The articles are not concerned with what causes epidemics or how they are treated.The reactions of people to really scary diseases is the theme. Whether they are ancient Athenians reacting to plague or us modern folks learning about AIDS, people seem to react to epidemics in the same ways: they try to find human scapegoats to blame for the outbreak and those who can try to leave the area where the disease has broken out. The novelty and physical loathsomeness of the disease also have a lot to do with what people do. Some of these articles are more readable than others; the best are on Hawaiian depopulation, epidemics in the Dark Ages, and the Athenian plague. Probably a book only for specialists or very serious nonspecialists."
4,"Interesting, but...","While informative, some of the essays in this volume are marred by bad writing and muddled jargon that obscures rather than clarifies the issue. That it's intended for a specialist audience is no excuse: clarity is important to everyone..."
4,jakes review,this is a great xgames it has everything with the winter and The vert skateboarding if like skateboarding rollerbalding or bikeing street vert or best even park yell love this has all the stars in When I sall it with my friends I had a party just for the xgames last year and we wacthed this and we wacthed 2 times it is great andy mic is great tony is the best I think I like skateboarding the most
5,Addicting,"If I could only have one spice in my cabinet this would be it, goes great on everything. I have started to ask for this at restaurants in hopes that they will start to have it available the next time I visit."
4,Great salt alternative for those who watch sodium intake,"I learned about this product when I visited Japan. They call it ""Crazy Salt or KURESOL"" and use it for everthing!The package looked very American so after I came home, I googled (image search and compared to the photo on my iPhone) and was I right! It is sold here!!I use it in place of plain salt & pepper seasoning. Just 1:1. I think since it is seasoned salt and herbs are basically fillers, I take less sodium if I go with the 1:1 ratio. I am salt sensitive and try not to have a lot of sodium in my diet so this product helps."
5,Best seasoning ever!,I discovered Aunt Jane's Crazy mixed up Salt a few years ago. I've used it in salads on vegetable - it makes all the difference in the flavor. Some local stores used to carry the product but the only place I can find it now is on Amazon
5,Disco!,Need to keep moving! Dance through the housework to YMCA and all the disco favorites! Hard to sit still when the beat is on!
3,Good disco compilation!,"Pure Disco is a good CD that is wonderful to dance to and I think would probably also be great to work out to, it is the best Disco compilation I have listened to, My favorite songs are Dancing Queen, Hot Stuff, I will Survive, I Love The Nightlife, If I Can't Have You, Funkytown, I Feel Love, Celebration, and Y.M.C.A."
5,AN AWESOME CD THAT WILL KEEP YOU DANCING TO THE DISCO!!,"This is the coolest CD ever!! If you like disco, this CD is for you!!! I always listen to Pure Disco, in fact, it's playing right now!! About 2 years ago, I fell in love with Disco, I bought this CD, and now I am Disco Fanatic! If you like to dance and have a good time, this CD is for you!! Also, Pure Disco 2 is another awesome CD!! Disco Rules!!!!! :)"
3,"Great service, didn't like the songs on the cd","I got it so fast, just love that. But the music (songs) sucked. I wanted something else, but it was my mistake, not the vendor's so thanks. Keep up the quick service, really coold."
5,Terrific!!!,"I absolutely loved this cd. It's got some awesome songs on it. At first, I just liked YMCA, but then I listened to more of it, and it was great! My favorites are YMCA, Dancing Queen, I Will Survive, and the Grease Megamix"
4,Great disco collection...,"I loved the whole cd, except the last track... I'm not fond of how they do a mega-mix on the last tracks of this series... Buy it though, you'll love it..."
3,Grease is NOT the word!!!!,"This is the first album in the three disk ""Pure Disco"" collection. You would think that would mean that it was mostly likely the best. Unfortunately, while there are some great songs on here there are some bottom of the barrel disco tunes thrown in and then at the end you get the Grease Mega Mix which isn't even disco. Should have been so much better. Disc 2 is much much better and really should have been the first release."
5,Pure Disco,"I loved this product. I've been searched this product for a long timeAnd it cross the world to be here in Brazil""This fine product work wonders!""Saxton Hele,CEO, Mann Co."
4,Classic Wooden Motor Yachts,"This is a delightful book, beautifully produced with a wonderful collection of wooden motor yachts. My only comment is that I would have liked to read more about the stats of each boat viz. how many berths, cruising range per tank of fuel etc. A plan of the layout of each boat would have been great. I wish Mr McClure would write a supplement including the above information and any more he has on each boat. I would certainly buy one."
4,good for laptops/notebooks,"I own a laptop computer which has decent onboard sound capabilities, but I recently discovered that it only has one audio input -- a microphone jack -- which is mono, and therefore is not suitable for recording stereo sources. Due to the fact that there is no way to install a ""real"" sound card in it, I needed an external solution. This USB sound system from Creative fits the bill. It didn't make a dramatic -- or even noticable -- difference in the quality of the audio coming out of my speakers; however, it did allow me to digitize my old cassette tapes and vinyl records, which is the main reason I bought it. If your computer can't accomodate a real sound card and its audio abilities aren't good enough for what you need, this might be the solution you're looking for."
3,Unattractive Price,PROS:+ Optical Connectors+ Windows XP can install a default driver+ Applicable in slow notebook+ Bass-Boost and graphical equilizer+ Real-time Audio Clean-up from external sourcesCONS:- Only two channels stereo- Only 88-DB Single-to-Noise Ratio- Expensive for two channel sound card
2,Wouldn't work with XP / Laptop,"Creative Labs USB Sound Blaster MP3+ External Sound Card Sound System: I seem to be the only one with this problem. I tried this unit on my Dell laptop to provide line-in capability for recording audio tapes. No go. After much research I came up with the info that XP limits the current draw of an USB port to 1000mA which was not adequate to power the device. I bought a powered USB hub and got it working, but not well or reliably enough to like it."
2,Works fine. Installed fine.,"It's not going to change your life, but it seems to be a good deal. I listen to internet radio while I work. I wanted something besides the cheapo card I have in the laptop. It certainly sounds at least $40 better. Unlike some other reviewers I had no problems installing on a Win 2000 machine.------------I wish I could reduce the number of stars because the unit died after two years."
1,Very poor sound Quality,"I bought this to add to my laptop to connect into my HiFi, The sound quality using the line-in was excuricatingly bad...I'm returning it!"
2,hi-fi...but only when it worked,"My Windows XP box wanted to want to configure this device every time I plugged it into a USB port as if it were the first time...very annoying. Also, it has stopped working all together, 4 months after purchase."
1,Don't buy it,the thing sound's ok - when it works. you'll be reinstalling drivers for 9 out of 10 times you use it. if you want good sound and trouble free operation look somewhere else.
5,I Use it to Record Voice for Presentations,"I use this adapter to record presentations through our P.A. system right to my laptop. You can run any audio through the RCA and it compresses and records directly to MP3. It's a great way to burn presentations right to CD. I haven't tried to use it to beef up my computer sound system, but for $40 it was well worth being able to record voices in a small file size."
5,I use it for optical 5.1 passthrough,I needed to setup my htpc recently and was in the market for a 5.1 soundcard with optical out. I remembered I bought a soundcard about 5 years ago for my pc at the time so I found it upstairs and to my suprise it has optical out. Unsure if it would allow 5.1 I hooked it up and sure enough it wont through windows 7 so I installed new drivers and it allows 5.1 passthrough if the source is 5.1.It wont allow 5.1 playback through windows or in games(I dont think).Volume and clarity is great through state of the art surround sound system(not a box system) so it will work great with any speakers you could use with a computer.
1,Too Thin,"Unfortunately, I found out how thin this cable is only after I opened the package...This thin, unshielded cable is good enough for your old NES from the 80's if you still have yours.Otherwise, keep looking. I highly recommend Cables to Go products instead of this."
5,Works,"It's hard to mess up a simple A/V cable, esp for a simple setup, and this cable just works. Great price, arrived quick."
5,heard it through the grape vine,"this text by internationally reckognized dr. michael ruckenstein has been very helpful to many of my friends in their studies. i am not an ent, however i know a few doctors in that field, and they have all given it rave reviews. congratulations dr. ruckenstein, may we see you publish more works, DA MAN~G.BROWN"
5,Very Good,"One of the authors of this book, David Gries, is my Computer Science teacher and hearing his voice (and that of his son Paul) on the multimedia CD is a weird experience, but extremely helpful. I can't stand just reading textbooks, and the multimedia CD allows me to have an interactive learning experience and not just stare at pages. The book is great as well but the learning CD is really what stands out. There are videos, exercises, sample programs, labs, you name it. Very easy to learn Java with it."
1,Read this book and still have no idea how to program,"This book might as well be 500 pages of random words lined up together. It makes no sense at all, and without following step by step on the computer you will gain nothing. If you have to do all this, what is the point of the book? Hated it."
4,a fine introduction to software requirements,"This book is very readable. The chapters are grouped into sections that cover broad skills used by teams in managing software requirements. Each chapter is fairly short and includes a concise summary at the end. The appendixes in the back of the book provide helpful examples of various software requirements documents.Why not five stars? The book is good, but it's not great. The index is functional, but not exhaustive. It's a fine textbook but it's probably not a book that would stay on my bookshelf for years after the class is through."
4,One of my favorite short films from the early 30s',"Ya know the ape is really a man in an ape suite, but the gags are just too good to resist. The boys loose their jobs at the circus but take part of the show with them, ""Ethel The Human Chimpanze"". The best parts are their attempts to keep Ethel from being discovered by the landlord, A totally insane Billy Gilbert whose wife just left him. Her name? You guessed it, Ethel!"
1,Light and Fluffy!,"If you are under 25, this book may have some valuable bits of information on ""getting what you want"" re career and personal life. But if you're like me, and have had a little life and work experience you may find it too simple and fluffy. This book reads like any issue of Cosmopolitan magazine, post Helen Gurley Brown. I think the recommendations are silly and not that insightful. After reading books like ""The Road Less Travelled"" (M. Scott Peck) and ""Feel the Fear and Do It Anyway"" (Susan Jeffers)I felt that this book was a bit of a waste of my time. I kept waiting to learn something more than what my mother told me. But maybe that's just what it's supposed to be. Also, the author uses examples of women who are almost exclusively in the magazine publishing business. A real yawn!"
3,9 Secrets of Women Who Get Everything They Want,"I liked the book, but it lost some credibility in that Kate White is supposed to earn her living as an editor, yet the book is not well edited. For example, on page 126, did she really go into her office and ball her eyes out? That is quite a visual image! Don't you think she meant BAWL?"
1,"Molly Ivins, Plaigiarist","Be forewarned: Molly Ivins is a serial plaigiarist, having been exposed twice. She stole the work of Tom Brokaw and Florence King. This book is a tiresome screed about Ms. Ivins tribulations as a noble progressive living among ignorant, hateful conservatives in Texas."
1,"Stale, smug, condescending","Why hasn't Molly Ivins disappeared yet? Can't she be replaced? Is there really such a shortage of Ann Richards disciples in the world? Her politics are very stale indeed, but any editorial writer with similar politics would be an improvement on her. The real irritant in her writing is not her politics, but her style and persona as demonstrated in this self-description of her newspaper days.""...I would denounce some sorry sumbitch...as an egg suckin' child-molester who ran on all fours and had the brains of an adolescent pissant, I would courageously prepare myself to be horse-whipped at the least.""All columnists seem happiest when writing about themselves and this passage is intended to be funny (this might need to be pointed out), but it is still a fair sample of her writing. What person (from Texas or anywhere else) wouldn't find this overdone impersonation of a redneck condescending? And who would buy a book that has so much smugness implicit in its title?"
1,"cd mali,o E by Kahua",I need to hear a sample of the music before i can rate it or purchase. so please provide me with a way to listen to this cd before I cn rate it.
5,The Answer,"What if we are descendants of the gods as the Egyptians claimed? Who built the pyramids? When? Why? How? Mr. Sitchin's The Lost Book of Enki answers these and many, many other intriguing and actually more difficult questions and IN ONE VOLUME. He is a genius. Now I believe in The Age of Aquarius and understand what it is to be about, at least in part. Everyone should read this fine, fine work. Zecharia Sitchin's The Lost Book of Enki puts Homer's The Odyssey to shame. Really. Although I love and respect The Odyssey, it really is not nearly as monumental an epic in its scope as is The Lost Book of Enki. Wow! Now, if only a certain somebody had not burned the library in Alexandria. Thank you Zecharia from salvaging this history from the ashes."
2,A fanciful tale,"What a disappointment this novel was. It lacked footnotes or referencing to back up Sitchin's ""filling the gaps"". I am a huge fan of Zecharia Sitchin and believe most of his original theories to be sound, but he went way too far with this one.Much of what is written in this novel contradicts his previous writings. I just wish he had given some basis for his leaps in imagination. I was left wondering which portions were based on ancient texts and which were flights of fancy.I would suggest buying a used edition."
2,Confusing.,I had a hard time following the writing. I just don't know if this is made up or real. Be warned...
5,Overwhelming,"I selected this book because I was reading a book by the Pleiadians & the books was talking about the story of two brothers Enki & Enlil. I have never read Zecharia books, but I was familiar with his work. I didn't know what to expect from the reading, but I most say it was well worth my time.This book is packed with: sex, lust, drama, procreation, creation, interplantary travel, war, warfare, astrology, Kings, Queens, family, betrayal, psychic dreams, labor, love, killing, exile, Nibiru affects on Earth, start of time, genetics, real names of icons in the bible & geniusness."
2,Not like Sitchin,"I am not sure what I expected when I got this book, but it certainly wasn't what I got.I have enjoyed Sitchin's previous work. His bold theories and suppositions about ancient mankind and his origins are fascinating and thought-provoking. ""Lost Book of Enki"" is none of that.Sitchin has, for some reason, felt it necessary to take his assumptions and build an epic poem out of them. For hard-core fans of his works this might be acceptable, even entertaining, but I fail to see how it furthers his position in the academic community. I was dismayed to see it in print. I would have liked to have seen more evidence from ancient manuscripts, more interpolation from hoary documents, more interpretation of legend and challenge to academia. Instead, I got a psuedo-intellectual attempt at saga.I sincerely hope Sitchin returns to his more effective presentation techniques in his next work."
5,"Enki.du, by Enki Created.",Stories presented in this books are basically the blueprint for why people do what we do. All these Sitchin books that explain a past that is there to help explain our present time and help us to point the way of where we should go or at least where we shouldn't go.
3,lost enki,"a little hard to read , because of the way the book was written but , i liked it fairly well, not as much as , end of days, tho"
2,Nothing but beautiful poetry,"Having read 4 previous of Mr Sitchin's works, another fine read this one, flowing like the waters of the Nile in beautiful poetic language, but, YES, there is a but...Mr. Sitchin ruined his integrity with this one. Every word in the before (his previous works) I consumed as if the unknown be made known, in the end (with this one) bothering was the ME, my conscience, how many words each of the tablets were able to contain. The tablets in length themselves must have measured 1 league or more each! Where are these tablets their translation to back up? No references are given of their location thereof. This much reminding of the socalled lost tablets of the Mormon Bible. The story too complete, too perfect, mine eye seeing beautiful poetry and myth only. Faith I have in God put blindly and willingly, yet to blindly this story as truth to accept would be a mistake. I believe that Mr. Sitchin is trying too hard to please his readers."
1,Boring,"All of Sitchins books are worthy of 4 or 5 stars, except this one. I think Sitchins books are great, but Sitchin has nothing new too say in this one. The writing style in this book was just flat out annoying. If you want to read a book that is more objective, read the Facade: By Michael S. Heiser or go to his web site: .... At least you can see, and judge for your self if Sitchin is on the write track. Sitchin seems to think that everything he has to say is Gospel. Sitchin might be flat out wrong."
4,Important Historical Overview,"This is potentially a very important book. Without having read other books by Zecharia Sitchin one would find the content unbelievable. In my view the book fills in many gaps but it still raises many questions. I would like to believe that the content is directly translated from clay tablets. If it is the case, then the book provides important historical revelation.Shaking the Tree"
3,This book is not the beginning series for Enki and Annunaki,"This book is a reference guide to the Sumerian tablets. If you are looking for an interpretation to the relationships between ancient writing and more traditional theological studies, this might be more your speed. It reads like Leviticus and Numbers in the Bible.If you are looking for more of a storyline where the information [in this book] is presented in more of a chronological order of events, you should consider one of the other Z.Sitchin books."
3,Thought provoking,"Takes some getting used to the prose-type writing, but if one has an open mind, this book could inspire much thought."
3,Good read...,"Good book and if it turns out that he's interpretation is accurate, would change our history forever... .but I can't find any proof that is accurate or inaccurate."
5,Fascinating!,"Very Good! Along the lines ofThe MESA FILE /Citizen Incorporated Part 1,this book tells of a fascinating alternate history of the Earth and its ancient, highly advanced, inhabitants."
1,really poor...,"i bought this book thinking it was really a good one,but he does not explain nothing.we have better books such( The Tutankhamun Prophecies: The Sacred Secret of the Maya, Egyptians, and Freemasons by Maurice Cotterell)"
1,this is a NOVEL!,"This book is not scientific research per se, it is a freakin novel! Much like the Da Vinci code, this is pseudo-history presented as a lost ancient text. I love 12th planet, but this is just weird."
1,This should be interresting but it's boring,"If mr Sitchin translated these tablets in the right way it's ofcourse very interresting stuff but don't buy this book!You can find more information on a sitchin web-site than you shall find in this book.It's a really stupid book to read. It's just like youre reading a 1000 year old bible. If it's true it's nice of course but that doesn't make the story interresting. There was not one time when i read this book that is said to myself: well this is interesting. No, it's a really boring book.You can spend your money better!"
2,Historical fiction or fictitious history and revisionism?,"This book is written in the style of a religious text with an ET bent. It is fiction, but since it is written by a popular (but not always reliable) historical researcher, it is dificult to tell what the intent is.A history it is bad. Some aspect of the story are very likely true, but much of it is the author's largely unfounded conclusions rewritten as historical fiction. If you want to understand the historical evidence and the author's theories, I suggest you read his other less-misleading books.As fiction, it is terrible. Like I said, its written in the form of a religious text.I suggest you just read some good books by researchers in the field, and also the Bible or other ancient myths and texts and come to your own conclusions. The idea that the gods of old were ET's can make all sorts of ancient texts more interesting, without resorting to this sort of revisionism."
1,Yoda writes a book in passive voice.,This book reads like Yoda wrote it in passive voice while forgetting to punctuate properly. There is no excuse for the quality of writing in this book. It may replace the Eye of Argon at science fiction convention midnight readings. It is so poorly written that it would not have been published by a 1950's science fiction pulp press.
4,a furious reader,"Terrible, awful and idiotic. It!s a simple SCANDAL!!!Never, never, never read it!and I think this book is good for... er.. zero star."
1,Thanks Zecharia!!!,"I wanted to thank Mr. Sitchin for his work, which led me into a search for the Truth. I've read all of his books and have his videos, which have been very useful! Without these, I would have had many unanswered questions.He has helped to make it all so clear: These Anunnaki are the fallen angels spoken of in the Bible. They, including Satan, want to be gods - what better way than to create a believable lie to fallen man and build yourself up to be a god?!? Sitchin helped me on my path to being saved! The ""Us"" in the Bible's ""let us make man in our image"" is not a bunch of gods, but actually God - the Trinity! Sitchin was headed in the right direction in ""Divine Encounters"" with his conclusion that Yahweh is the God of the Universe. However, he never has discussed who Jesus Christ actually is! I'll help: He is God the Son, Creator of all time, space & matter. The Truth IS out there!"
3,What could be easier?,"If you don't like to cook from scratch, you'll love this cookbook. Everything comes from a box, bottle, can or package...as easy as using a can opener. Friendly, down to earth format makes this a pleasant, even if not super healthy, cookbook."
4,Franklin Planner/Organizer,"I ordered this franklin planner for my 83-year old dad as a Christmas present. He needed to replace an old day timer, and I was uncertain whether this version would be inferior to those I could get directly from Franklin-Covey. Given the price discount, I had my doubts. We both were pleasantly surprised! It's as sturdy and the same as all the other Classic ones that i've owned."
2,What happened to quality control?,"My knife arrived with the handle (which is a rubberish material) off axis. The butt was scarred and off-color.Moreover, I did not like the seller: when I returned the knife, I had to follow up with a request for shipping fee reimbursement.The knife itself, aside from the qc issues, was very sharp and of good weight and balance. The blade was not, or did not appear to be, stainless, however, and this might prove an issue.tlt-"
4,WAY better than Aqua Teen,All episodes from the show that gets better the later it gets into the night. I was very pleased with this purchase.
2,Not bad if....,"...you're looking to depict your characters primarily in one set of pants, a skirt, one loose shirt and a leather jacket...and only if they're female. I bought this book thinking it had more information on how to draw clothing in general (folds, drapes, wrinkles) but the book only very lightly touches on that subject for about two pages in the beginning of the book. It's predominantly a ""pose file"" and there are other much better pose file books you can find.A lot of the ""How to Draw Manga"" books seem to assume you're already an artist of some skill and training, so this book is definitely not for beginners. If you're the type that can learn by sight alone, by all means, give it a try. Otehrwise I'd suggest going with a more basic instructional."
3,"Informative, in a textbook way.","Not as much flair for the dramatic as I expected, but does line out certain figures in Irish mythology quite nicely."
4,Great for serious students of Irish myth and Celtic culture,"As a die-hard Celtophile, I thoroughly enjoyed this collection. Gantz's translations capture the cadences of the original tales so that the reader can get a feel for how they must have sounded to their original audiences. The selected tales also give insight into the Celtic culture, showing clearly their value of warcraft and battle while also portraying their acute sensitivity to beauty.After having assigned this book to college-level World Lit students, however, I have to say that the translations aren't as accessible to the casual reader. Many of my students found the tales confusing and--unfortunately--tedious. With that in mind, newcomers to Irish/Celtic myth and folklore may wish to begin their exploration with a more modernized text before delving into this one."
3,good book for the Celtic scholar,"Most mythology collections do not contain word for word translations of the myths, instead choosing to let the author retell them. Gantz' book, however, is a direct translation (making changes only where necessary) and many readers might be put off by the form in which these tales have come down to us. Accustomed to more linear storytelling, some readers might have difficulty following. However, for the serious scholar, this book is very important as it gives the student a chance to see what was actually written in the Book of the Dun Cow, etc., references we surely know by name from other mythology introductions. If you do pick up this book, be prepared to concentrate perhaps more than you are used to and you will be well rewarded."
3,Shipshape Rendering of Old Irish Material,"This anthology probably provides enough to satisfy the general reader regarding early Irish literature. The translations are well selected. Personally, I would have preferred a bit more commentary, but in general this book goes about as far as one can go in describing Old Irish literature without entering into the field of the specialist."
4,Yeats' Inspiration,"The flood of mythically inspired movies in the last few years highlights the fact that the best new stories are the old ones. And like most movies, their books are better. Gantz provides a useful preamble to each section, which is vital for newcomers. We've literally lost our imaginations and need a tutor to remind us that the people we're reading about could be gods, too. The description of Etain (page 62?) is breathtaking. Caution: The guide to pronunciation is woefully inadequate and detracts from an otherwise pleasant diversion. On to Yeats!"
4,Early Irish Myths,"If you want to hear some fairy tale that you may not have heard before, then this is the book for you. some of the stories have elements of tales that you will already know quite well."
5,Think like Fink,"Hello there, old lady!Having sat through not one but TWO fink classes, I couldn't help but notice your name and email. Whether you are fink himself or one of his proteges, here's to you!For those of you not fortunate enough to learn from this man first-hand, grab your chance to learn from him now. I learned more in his two classes (newspaper management and public affairs reporting) than I did in any other.Fink hasn't just read about the issues: he's lived them."
5,Best buy,"Definitely the best and clearest book so far on this subject!! Written by a real top expert in this field (I took his course, the best eco. course I have taken). Much better than Green's book. If you are a serious graduate student in economics and management, especially those of you who are pursuing a PhD instead of only taking a course, it is the best for you. In-depth! Also frankly, it is not for a vaint brain and a guy with weak background.Only with this book and Johnston & Dinardo's, read and enjoy, then you will understand econometrics absolute confidently.Don't wast your money on other books!"
3,Insufficient explanations/background info for an intermediate text.,"I took the econometrics class from Davidson at McGill University that used this book, and it was not the best learning experience. This book is a good, rigorous ""reference"" text, with good definitions, for someone with a really solid knowledge of the subject, who wants an in-depth reference on matrix-based approach to econometrics. Or you just need a teacher who explains all the concepts and derivations in great detail and provides examples and solutions (which Davidson did not do in class or in this textbook). The text itself does not contain explanations of the material, so unless this is your 2nd or 3rd graduate-level econometrics class, expect to need several more accessible backup/background texts/teachers."
5,Great book,This book in THE introduction to econometrics.Davidson is a great econometrician and gives a lot of intuition.All the basics of econometrics is contained in the book.
5,Exactly as expected,"I'm pursuing a graduate degree in economics and this book strikes a great balance of readability and completeness. It doesn't contain detailed proofs for every claim it makes which I, for one, find beneficial. I think the organization is solid."
1,Sanctuary By Robert Lyn Asprin,The thieves world series is fantastic I read them when they first came out and was very excited to get the Sanctuary Anthology. I wish I had as much luck when I ordered the used book club The volume set and recieved Nora Roberts Novel entitled Sanctuary instead. Caveat Emptor on this one folks make sure you know what you are ordering!!
2,Step by Step?,This is only a step by step process if you have access to the single-user version 7.5 on your PC already or have access to a training area. This would have been helpful if this was in the description. I would not have bought this to learn PeopleSoft had I known that.
3,This book falls short.,"While I found some of the information quite helpful, I was also disappointed that the text is full of errors. Most of the errors were typographical, but there were also some topics that did not list complete steps to follow. As a technical trainer, I have great experience with step by step books and unfortunately this one falls short."
5,Remote Extender,The RCA D940 works as advertised. You do have to be very close (within 4ft)to the signal sender and your hand held remote. From the sender to the receiver the distance can be over 100ft traveling through walls from room to room and outdoors to indoors.
4,This is great!,I put a TV in my kitchen but wanted to share the reciever with the TV in my room since I would hardly ever use both at the same time. I tried one from radio shack that didn't work we at all and was more expensive than this one - I am very pleased.
1,Deception,I ordered this unit as new and received it today. It is NOT new. There is even a stain on the instruction booklet. The signal senders were wrapped in Cling Wrap. And I couldn't get it to work. I wouldn't buy this and am very annoyed that I was deceived into thinking it was new. There were fingerprints all over both units.
4,Now i control my favorites programs at different locations,Works very well no interference at all and easy to hyde from the direct view.I recomed it.
2,Audiovox D-940 Remote control sender,"This remote sender unit is not the same as the RCA unit that is picturedin the sales ad. Don't expect to get a remote extender that looks orperforms like the RCA D-940 pyramid. They are not the same. The audiovoxmodel is fair, but not as good as the RCA D-940."
5,The answer to my needs,"I have this very sender in use for the past 8 years and now with this purchase of a second set it has expanded my dp322 to an additional TV.Great item, and I reccomend it to friends and neighbors."
1,have to be close to sender,You have to be close to the sender for it to get a single from a DTV remote with new batteries. I even tried 3 different remotes. Maximum range from the remote you hold in your hand to sender 8 ft.
2,Fun for maybe a day.,"If these balls were, say, maybe 20 cents a ball they would be wonderful but at their current price they are so overpriced.My dog is not an aggressive chewer and loves to play with this play but.. after maybe 20 times playing with it and the chuck-it it no longer squeaks it can still be played with but.. it's not the same.Other dogs who chew and or slobber a lot the toy gets filled with saliva and if you play with it in the water it will get filled and start to sink: you can squeeze the liquid out but it's gross especially if it is saliva- EW!"
1,over priced cheap junk,"For my senior tennis ball and squeaky toy obsessed dog I thought these would be perfect. Counted on ""Kong"" name for quality. What a crock! Not only does the ball quit squeaking after a few minutes but the plastic squeaker comes out in the dog's mouth creating a real hazard. Terrible product. Bad form ""Kong""!"
5,My puggle loves them,They are the perfect size for my 5 month old puggle puppy. She loves these things and can keep herself entertained for hours with them. Great for when I don't feel like playing with her every second of a day off.
3,the dogs probably like that it squeeks,"had it been able to last or if my dog wasn't such an avid chewer, I would have given this 5 stars. The squeeker spoiled within a few hours with the golden retriever. Forgot to keep it after play a few days later and it is barely recognizable. Unless you are prepared to replace your balls often, go for the ChuckIt! Can't remember the name but it is the orange with blue lines. That one doesn't squeek though but it is proving to be indestructable so far."
1,WIll not last,There are three of these squeaker balls in the pack. Not one lasted more than an hour with our dog. Too flimsy. Surprised as a similar product I had brought earlier (KONG Air Dog Squeaker Ball) lasted for a while.
1,All 3 squeakers were dead within 1-5 minutes,"All 3 squeakers were dead within 1-5 minutes with an 8 y.o. mini doxie. Really dissappointed considering the brand. She IS good at destroying squeakers, but in most cases that requires either her ripping the rubber toy apart or much more time of just non-stop squeaking to finally wear it out. In this case, the balls looked new but no longer worked, or the squeaker had been either popped out (hopefully not swallowed!!!) or fallen into the ball. Will not buy again."
5,Squeaky Ball,"I have a hard time finding these in the pet stores and my Aussie loves them. These were smaller than the one I currently have, but that is my fault for not paying better attention when I was purchasing."
1,terrible squeaky ball,"I bought a package of these squeaky balls for my 6 month old puppy because he loves squeaky toys. He took the squeaker out and was chewing it. If I hadn't seen him chewing it, he would have swallowed it. I think they should be taken off the market. They are dangerous."
1,AWORLDOFPUPS sent the wrong size,Ordered a bunch of these from two different companies. AWORLDOFPUPS sent the wrong size and now I have to take time from my busy day to return them but only after AWORLDOFPUP gives me permission to fix their screw up. ABC Pet Plaza sent the correct size. Never again from AWORLDOFPUPS.
3,"These are for fetching, not chewing!","To start, all the people that are upset that their dog chewed the balls up should realize these are meant to be fetched and not chewed. Fetching is what I bought them for and they work for that just fine. Although, the squeaker doesn't last long at all. The first ball had the squeaker last about 30 throws. I have a Miniature Schnoodle that's lucky to fit the ball in her mouth let alone chew it so now having no squeak is disappointing but for the price I don't feel it's worth the effort to return. I'd buy them again just to get the smaller ball and not pay twice as much at a local store."
3,Kong air squeak balls,Kong air squeak balls are very durable for a small dog. misread the package and thought that that they were large like a tennis ball.
4,Pretty good!,"I have a super destructive Boston terrier. She loves these balls! The most indestructible toys make it maybe 10 mins. the should use her to test toys. Nothing lasts very long.Now she gets these a part pretty quick, but they last longer than other toys. The great thing is that even when she gets the fuzz off, the ball is still intact versus other balls that crumble. The squeaker goes fast, but that's ok with me.She is small but I sometimes by the large because it takes her longer to get a part. A large one will last in tact fuzz and all for a few weeks and the ball itself will last a few months depending on how obsessed she is with it. I have torecommend these."
5,good for small dog,nice and good for small dog to play with. good price made well . If you have a small dog with energy this is it .
3,Kong squeaky balls,These are my dogs favorite toys....but she ( an 18 month old Yorkie) has learned to put a hole in the ball and shread the fuzzy layer within 1/2 hour.
4,dogs enjoy,my dogs love these balls i got the smaller ones for the little dogs n these ones for the larger dog they love the squeek in the ball.
2,Bad toy for the teething puppy,"Our 12 week old puppy loves these. Loves them. The squeak seemed to last as long as the ball did, which doesn't say much because our pup chewed the heck out of these, even with our supervision. They're great to play fetch with, but the our pup chewed the fuzz off and bit right into these. Wouldn't purchase these again."
2,2 Stars on Quality - 4 Stars on How Much My Dog Loves them!,These don't last so expect to keep buying these little tennis balls.My dog is only 10 lbs - doesn't tear things up but she has no trouble chewing these balls apart within a matter of a week+.the squeakers die within minutes.it's a surprisingly poorly made product.BUTmy dog would say otherwise. she loves them. like loves loves - her favorite toy while it still is intact.so i'm on my THIRD purchase because of her - i'm going to try to find stronger tennis balls so i dont have to replace them so quickly.
1,Terrible quality for a Kong product,"I'm a long time Kong customer and have to say this product was very disappointing. Squeakers broke within minutes. Balls came apart within hours. Just terrible. Next time I'm buying a solid rubber squeak ball, not the 2 half-spheres glued together like this crap."
2,Not very tough for a Kong brand,"My dogs love smaller toys that they can easily throw and roll around, but within a couple minutes these toys had lost their squeeker or popped"
4,Little Ball for Little Dogs,"My pug likes balls that make noise and Kong has great stuff so I thought I'd give these a try.First thing first - He is not an aggressive chewer. Although, I don't think these are meant to be for those kinds of dogs anyway. These are a serious choking hazard for larger dogs so I am careful to keep them up where my other dogs can't get them when not in use.For a small dog, they fit easily in their mouth and they squeak loudly. My only complaint would be that they roll under furniture 9 times out of 10 but that's my dogs fault (or mine), not the products."
3,The Squeakie part is no more in less than 5 min,Well my little dogs love them becuase they can squeeze the ball in their mouth and it squeaks but that part gets dislodged easily in a few minutes. So you left with a rattling noise until they destroy the ball and take out the plastic squeky device.SO i still like them because they do really like them .
1,Kong Squeaker,"I thought with the Kong name the balls would last, but they didn't. Waste of money, they didn't last 2 days."
3,short squeak life,Perfect size for the cockapoo.They are durable as you would expect a tennis ball to be.Squeaker falls out too soon (deduct 2 stars).
3,Not very durable but dogs love them,"I have a Jackchi & a Shichi, both about 10lbs. These are just the right size for them. But the squeakers stop working & either get pushed inside or pulled out by the dogs within a day. The furry covers start to shred off within about 3 days & are mostly bald within a week with pieces of the covering all over the place. The dogs still play with them though, they just look a bit worse for wear. I will buy again as there is really no other option for these."
4,Awesome!,"I have a beagle who is nuts for any toy that makes noise. These balls are by far the best toy ever for her! Sometimes she can get the squeaky out, but not as easily as other toys she has had. These are the toughest!She chases it if I throw, but also will hide it under things and then act like she miraculously finds it when she uncovers it!! I love to see her have so much fun! She acts like it is a real animal because of the noise!! Plus it is squishy and she can gnaw on it! I laugh just watching her be so happy with a toy!"
1,Lasts about 10 squeaks,"I won't lie...my 30 pound mixed breed dog adores these squeaky balls. However, after he chomps down on them (because he wants to hear it squeak) about 5 times the squeaker breaks and another few chomps and the rubber seam separates. As another reviewer said, the small plastic squeaker can come loose and fall out the hole it is set in (the squeaker is just a small cylinder glued in to a small hole). I've pulled two plastic squeakers out of my dog's mouth, which he got out while bringing the ball back to me after fetching. He can eat a normal tennis ball just as readily so all the balls are up on a shelf except during play time. At least with the regular balls there's no plastic piece to come out for him to swallow. And like others have said, when I see the Kong name I expect it too last more than 5 minutes, especially when the dog is merely squeaking the toy as intended."
3,A good size for a small dog but they get dirty easily,"I have a joint-custody arrangement for a 6 pound toy Yorkshire terrier. We play fetch often and I have been using 2"" rubber balls which so far have worked well. However, I decided to give this smaller balls a try, especially because they have a squeaker in them. Bella (the Yorkie) loves the sound of the squeak and knows that it is time to play when hears it. Kong has a good name so I felt comfortable buying this set.They are a great size for her, easy to pick up and too big for her to swallow accidentally. However, they get dirty pretty easily and she has been able to pull the fuzzy part off of one of them. I like the size, but I think that I prefer the solid, rubber-type balls since they are easier to clean. I don't think that I will be buying more."
1,Cheap,The squeakers lasted all of about 5 minutes. Totally worthless. You might as well just buy regular tennis balls.
1,"Some DOA, Some Last a Little While,","These would be great dog toys if they lasted. Some have been Dead On Arrival, and some died a little later. None lasted more than a few weeks.I would suggest buying them locally where they can be tested before purchase.With some durability, I would give five stars. My dog told me to say this."
1,Didn't last 5 minutes with my 8wk old puppies,"Bought thinking it was a quality dog toy like the other Kong products I have bought, but was I surprised. Squeeker stopped squeeking after about 5minutes of play with my 3 puppies (8-9wks old), and you could hear the squeeker rattling around inside the ballCall Kong about this, turns out THIS toy is not covered under their warranty, AND they offered to replace it for ""FREE"" as a one time only offer if I would return it to them. At a cost of $2.00+ to mail it back to them, the replacement SURE isn't going to be free, in fact it is going to cost me MORE to replace it from Kong than it would cost to just BUY a new oneBottom line, avoid this shoddy Chinese made product like the plagueJohn"
1,Doesn't last,"I've bought four of these packs (12 balls). The squeaker dies within minutes! If it wasn't for the squeaker, I'd just use my old tennis balls. The squeaker quality on these things are terrible. For the price, these things are a rip off."
1,Squeaker Tennis Balls,May be fine for a small dog but only last one or two bites from a Husky. When the squeak is done so is the dog. My back yard is littered with No More Squeak Tennis Balls. Sorry. Cannot recommend.
1,False advertising,"I am furious this is advertized as made in the USA but when they came I noticed a sickening smell so I read the back of the label. The company address is in Colorado, it says designed and tested in the USA but it is made in China. Every dog I've had has died of cancer and we know multiple products have had dangerous ingrediants or materials coming from China. These have caused death and illness. Do not buy these. Cadimium in childrens jewelry, melamine in pet food, lead in paint & childrens toys and books, some unknown chemical in Heparin (blood thinner) it almost killed my daughter. I will not buy anything or use anything coming from China. Return manufacturing to America, they own us and are killing us with poisons."
1,Not durable at all,These always last only one session at the park before it stops squeaking. I've bought a three pack and each one stop working the first day of use.
1,My dog loves it but durability is really bad,"My 6.5 months old german shepherd loves this ball, however it won't last him 10 minutes before it breaks down, I had high hope it will last like chuckit(i have 2 that he still plays since 8 weeks), but it fails within 10 minutes of playing time."
2,Expected Stronger Ball from Kong,"Kong is known for making some nearly indestructible toys for dogs, so this seemed like a good purchase.In fact, the look, feel, weight and sound of the ball all seem quite high quality.But my small border collie quickly has the green felt all over, the squeaker removes, and the ball in pieces.What's needed is a much more durable ball, and Kong seemed like the one to do it. But they haven't done it here."
4,Favorite toy for dog in their terrible twos.,"My two year old Jack Russel Terrier loves these. He has a toybox full of choices but these are by far his favorite. The average lifespan of the ball in his world is approximately two weeks, which is good considering he is capable of destroying anything including the living room wall."
1,"Sqeaker DOA, too small for small dogs","When these arrived, one squeaker was non-functional and another died after 1 minute of play. But we're done playing with them because ultimately these are too small for my 17 pound mini schnauzer. She can get them all the way in her mouth which makes me worry that they're a choking hazard. They'd be fine for toy breeds, so I guess I the extra-small label means only for extra small dogs. I'd recommend the Kong tennis ball stick instead[...]that one is still squeaking and no concern for choking."
2,Not Strong Enough,"My small Pom mutt is my baby boy, and he loves these tiny squeak tennis balls. I like to whip him into a frenzy with the squeaker and then send him chasing after it down the hall. Problem is he may love it too much, and the tennis ball-like coating is not built to last even a small dog's gnawings. Abe, who may be 8 pounds soaking wet, chews off the exterior fiber of the ball gradually, and will occasionally ingest it if unsupervised. Haven't had any serious problems as a result, but obviously it's not good for him, and I imagine it does cause some degree of gastrointestinal discomfort on its way through and, ahem, out of, the system."
4,pitbulls love kongs,"i love kong products! I have a 50lb pitbull / staffie mix and he loves the ""extreme"" kong chew toys. he also loves to chase tennis or chuckit balls. I am rating these as a 4/5 because the plastic squeaker in the middle of the toy does not last long with my dog. he doesn't chew or eat, or tear the fuzz off of the balls but he does chomp on them when he retrieves. I guess doing this for a week straight causes the squeaker to pop or it just jingles inside the ball & stops making noise. Not a huge deal since the ball still technically ""works,"" i just know he enjoys hearing the squeak too."
5,"KONG Air Dog Squeakair Tennis Balls Dog Toy, Medium, Yellow, 3/pack","My dog (60 lb. Lab) LOVES these balls! Easy to squeak, normal, good quality tennis balls- good bounce! We're glad we purchased these!"
5,Release a 20-pack & I'd buy 'em!,"My 10-lb long-haired chihuahua, Princi, LOVES these toys. She could care less about any other toy in the world, but you bring out one of these little guys & we'll hear squeaking for days. Her goal in life is to make that squeaky instrument her slave so she spends hours, days, weeks!, tearing the ball up to get to it. Then when she finds it she'll come find us like 'Look, Mommy! Look, Daddy! I's a good girl now!'Then she doesn't give one ounce of time to the shell of the ball. So, it's round two with the next one.These are great toys for small dogs & if Kong released a 20-pack, they'd be ordered real quick in my house!"
2,They love it... for about 5 seconds until they kill the squeak,"These squeak balls were the perfect size and shape for my squeak toy loving Pekingese. I was so excited to give them these balls, but needless to say, they lasted for about 10 minutes until my boys punctured them and killed the squeak and then didn't want to play with them anymore. If they can make a more durable ball like this that my dogs can keep for more than a day, I would be happy to try it again. I am rating this a 2 and not a 1 because for the 10 minutes that they had the balls and they were squeaking, my boys were in heaven."
2,Kong Squeaker Tennis Balls,"If your dog is a chewer, especially of squeaker toys I would not recommend this toy. While these are a good size for small dogs to play fetch, it took my dog only two days of off and on play to puncture the squeaker in the first ball and only a day on the second ball. He also chewed some of the cover off the toy."
2,lasted 5 minutes. not worth it.,"i thought this toy would be perfect for my lil maltese/poodle since he loves squeaker balls, but he pulled off the fuzz w/in 5 minutes and the toy had to be thrown away. very disappointing."
1,Tiny Tennis Balls,"I loved these little tennis balls at first and so did my little Chihuahua mix dog.However, I had to pull some fuzz out of her mouth...I ended up throwing the tennis balls away.PLEASE don't let your LITTLE dog get this fuzz down her throat....can you imagine the Vet bill when shechokes, coughs on this!!!"
3,Doesn't hold up very well,Very small. I thought it would be tennis ball size. It gets very fuzzy quickly and the dog gets choked on the fuzz. I wouldn't recommend it.
2,Not for power chewers,If you have a dog that is more interested in chewing than chasing this product will not be suitable. My 20lb dog can rip the covering off one of these in less than 10 minutes. If your dog is more interested in chasing then this will work for you.
5,Cheaper at Target,"These are great toys...our golden loves them, but a canister of 3 balls is only $3.00 at Target!!"
1,"Wow, Very Disappointing AND Possibly Dangerous","Somewhere I got it in my head that KONG was the manufacturer of good dog products. Boy was I mistaken or mislead. And unfortunately I wasted a bunch of money on squeaky balls. The first thing to go was the squeaker. Well okay, I thought, that's only part of the fun, so I wasn't upset. But then my poodle chewed the cover off the ball and ripped it apart in no time flat.What the heck?This is supposed to be a CHEW-toy. If an 8 month old poodle pup can't chew it for longer than a week, then its a pretty junky product. (He mostly chases balls and does his chewing on Bully Sticks.)Now to the dangerous part. It was so easy for my pup, who is a large miniature, to destroy the ball that I can't recommend them at-all. In fact, we are now waiting to see what happens and if a visit to the vet is in our future, because bits and pieces are missing and we're hoping that Pippin didn't swallow them.Not worth the money or the worry.Pam T~"
1,NOT made in USA,"I try to make sure that anything going into my dog's mouth is not made in China. Shame on the people who wrote the product description here on Amazon which states that this product is made in the USA. When I received the product, I found the tag on the balls states clearly that these toys are designed and tested in the USA but made in China. I do not appreciate the blatant false advertising."
1,DANGER DANGER DANGER,"My dog had the little plastic squeeker out in five minites, and got chocked on it. It is not worth 10 cents."
3,ok,The only problem with these balls is that the squeaky doesn't last very long. In fact one ball didn't work at all. My dog also likes to chew off the fuzz. I would look for a ball that is not covered in fuzz.
5,Riley loves it,"We have a new puppy, as soon as i took the product out of the package and threw it on the floor it was like he was in love. He loves them."
2,Not what they are cracked up to be.,I have been looking and looking for a strong squeeky toy for my Jack Russell and this is not it. He loved them even though he de-squeeked the first one in a few hrs. The second and third took only moments. He still likes to chase the ball for a few minutes before he's bored.
4,great! thanks!,"Great product, and came quick! The only problem was, it was described as a hardcover, but was a paperback. Unless a slightly thick cardstock cover counts as hardcover. So that was misleading. otherwise, everything was great! no problems. thanks!"
2,Just did not like this item,I read this book from cover to cover and I think it is writen more for women then men. This probably why I did not enjoy it as much as I had hoped.
2,Repeat of NT Server 4.0,"I bought this book because I bought the NT Server 4.0 book from these guys (which I would rate 4 or 5 stars). Unfortunlately, except for 1 1/2 chapters, it is the exact same book! So I am sending it back. I have to think there is more to the Enterprise test than what I studied for the Server Test. If not, I guess it would be a good book since I liked the NT Server 4.0 book."
3,Not what you think,"More a compilation of folks, facts and figures in the ""Known Space"" Universe, this has interest to Niven completists, but do not expect it to cut any new ground. It may give the casual reader a better insight into the goings on all around the galaxy of the Niven stories."
3,NOT Compatible with Mac OSX,Listed system requirements for this product should be changed. It is only compatible with versions of OSX that run Classic. Newer versions of OSX (10.4 and later) no longer support Classic.
3,"It's ok, but...","This is a very pretty cover, but I'm not too thrilled with it for actual use. It has a smooth finish that tends to be hard to grip except in the two areas where the dragonflies are located. Would not recommend it for young or inexperienced drivers."
2,dissapointing,"I got it apx 8-22ish..& went out of town (didnt drive for 2wks) i'm back now & have only driven w/ it 4x since being out of town & the little 3d features have started pealing off, i had one just like it i got from walmart 3yrs ago & it didnt start peeling for 6mo, so i can only assume this one may be old stock even tho i got it new...it does the job & matches my seat covers. other than the tiny skinny things peeling off it's great it's soft velour & a great feeling grip."
3,Dragonfly Wheelcover,"The lavender dragonfly wheel cover was very nice and it coordinated with the floor mats and seatcovers very well. My only issue was installing the wheelcover - other than that, this was a great buy!"
1,Falling Apart,"The cover was on the steering wheel for less than a month when it started falling apart. The fabric is coming detached from the plastic parts. My daughter is very upset as this cover matches her seat covers.VERY, VERY, VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Goddess Blackwoman,I think this book is very informative. Although I am not a Muslim woman I do support some of their philosophies. I know that when the author is referring to God he is in fact referring to the black man. I am learning a lot by reading this book and like all other books I read I filter out what works for me and my life. In no way do I think the book has a misogynistic approach but simply a firm and realistic approach for sistas living in the united states in this day and age.
1,Patronizing Pimp Mindmeld for the Unsuspecting,"This is not a true book exalting and proclaiming Black Goddess. Do not buy if you are a conscious Black Goddess. This is the work of an average man attempting to pimp Black women unawakened to our divine birthright. This is a poorly written, condescending book by a Muslim misogynist. Sistahs, beware and BE AWARE."
1,AC/DC Tribute,"When searching for an AC/DC album this appeared, my fault I didn't look close enough, it was late, I was tired, but this SUCKS!"
2,Wellllll.....,"Well...lets see. The tribute is a good idea, great songs. The singing is horrible, but the acousitcs are amazing. Who knew you could take a bad-ass song like ""For those about to rock (we salute you) and play it on an acousitc guitar? But as for the singing goes, let's not pansey down AC/DC. Their a hard rock band, and they shouldn't be sung by female singers that sound like they should be singing country songs. Come on guys! That's like having Jimi Hendrix sing Stairway to Heaven.Ride On"
2,"Scintillating subject, but plodding narrative","Reinhold Messner may be the Michael Jordan of mountaineering, but his writing style is flat footed. In his exploits, Messner has the raw material for some of the most compelling adventure literature of all time, but instead he produces little more than dull climbing notes (although accompanied by some interesting photography). There was very little illuminating introspection (even the account of his brother's death was pedestrian). I place this at the bottom of the heap of mountaineering literature"
2,Not Everyone Can Write,"I have the utmost respect for Messner as a climber, but not everyone is meant to be a writer. I've tried at least 3 times to get through this and I just can't. I'm sorry, he's a terrible writer and after struggling for an hour or so to choke it down I pick up something else. Sometimes ghost writing is the way to go."
2,Disappointing,"Hard to believe that one could write such a dry account of the amazing climbing life of one of the world's most ambitious climbers. Full of facts, and probably very accurate, it fails to capture much ""magic""."
5,Useful!,"It is a realy helpful tool.Recomendo este libro para cualquier pincipiante en el campo de los VFX, los temas tratados son de gran ayuda para poder dominar una de las especialidades de Alias Maya, la cual es ""Fluid Effects""! Buena invercion!"
5,50 amp receptacle,What can you say? It's a brand name receptacle of seemingly high quality. It installed easily when I got the proper box.
1,Returned book to store,"This book looked really interesting when i picked it up. Also i like discovering new authors. The premise of the book sounded like something Rachael Gibson or Lori Foster would do and i totally love their writing but this was such a let down. I got to like chapter 3 and closed it, found my receipt and took a trip back to the bookstore to return it. I could not stand either character and how they were portrayed. I'm all for the strong independent woman but she was a bit overdone in my opinion and she made him look totally incompetent in his writing and he didn't seem to stick up much for his ability at all. It just wasn't a very good book in my opinion and I don't hold out much hope for the next title available by this author."
1,Totally Disappointed.,"When I looked at this book, I could looked like a fun read. After slogging through the book, I can tell you that I'm hugely disappointed. The hero, Cole Ryder in this story sounds like a pretty great guy although why he puts up with the heroine's neurosis is beyond me. I mean, come-on, lust/attraction will only carry you so Far. I don't know too many guys that would jump through the hoops that Ariel puts Cole through. Even more, why would you require someone to jump through those hoops? Protecting your heart is one thing, being obsessively neurotic about it something else. I lost total patience with Ariel and began to wonder about what kind of a guy Cole was after he put up with all that nonsense. I know that I will not be spending my hard earned money on any Tina Donahue books from now on. It was just a total disappointment."
1,Chick Lit at its worst,"No stars actually! What a waste of money. I read the first few chapters and was not happy. But, I thought, give it a chance. Well, I did. I cannot recommend this book for anything but the trash. By the way, there is ""chick lit"" and then there is porn. This is the latter."
4,Great Research Tool,I got this book as resaerch tool for my college search for the theatre arts major. I was able to narrow it down to the ones I wanted to apply to. Now I am an Acting major at Boston University. It gives great information about the programs at the schools and is highly respected by the majority of all the colleges in it.
4,Helpful guide to music schools,"I used the 2nd edition of this book when I was an undergraduate searching for a good grad school. I found the information to be clear, and, for the most part, accurate. Of course, teachers and institutions can change rapidly, so a student would be wise to consult a university's website or recruiting materials for the most up-to-date information, but I found the print guide to be a good starting point. I am now a university music teacher and recently had one of my students use the 3rd edition while searching for a grad school.Yes, this book is primarily intended for high school students. However, a graduate student may also find it to be of use...I did!"
2,Laurie,"When first published I am sure this book was an excellent resource, but it was published in 1998 making it next to useless now. When I ordered this book the publishing date was not shown on Amazon's website.In Amazon's defense when I complained their response was execellent. I was able to return the book and get all my money back including shipping. I also note that publishing dates are now included on the website. Thank you Amazon!"
3,For Those Of You That Dont Know..........,"This is Witchdoctor,from the dungeon family. It seems this album is out and nobody even knows cuz he kind of changed his name and went to an underground label. Overall, i was dissapointed with this album, considering his other one (Witchdoctor- A.S.W.A.T. healing ritual) was one of the best cd's to come out the ATL since Outkast. That was a classic cd no doubt. This is kinda different wit different beats that dont really work. He needs to get back with outkast, goodie mob and get some beats like he had on his old album. I give this a 3/5..his other one was a 5/5 no doubt.."
4,"Gregg Allman ""The Best Of Gregg Allman""","There are a few tracks on this album that I really don't like, some are tolerable, and then there are the songs that make up for any imperfections. You know, the ones that make the CD worth 15 bucks. They chose to represent Gregg here with one of his finest Allman Bros. tracks, a chick-friendly, piano-driven love song, a live track, and then those wonderful, laid-back songs that I favor. Gregg Allman is nothing if not southern and extremely laid-back, and that's just the way I like his music.Standout Tracks: Melissa, These Days, Multi-Colored Lady"
1,So Sad...,My 10 year old son was able to open this without knowing the combination because it's so loose. I returned mine.
1,"Lock combo changes too easily, don't buy","My combination somehow reset to some unknown combination, and now it will not lock. Even before this happened, it was difficult to open with the correct combination entered. This lock is complete garbage, do not waste your money."
2,Not a outside lock,After a few months the dials locked and we had to cut it off. I purchased for a outside storage unit.
1,4-5 uses and it seized up,"It was a cool little lock, great for a gym locker which is what I used it for... until it seized up and wouldn't unlock"
2,Me too - accidental reset,Add me to the list of those who accidentally reset this and had to throw it out. Too bad! It's a nice lock otherwise...
4,A good basic lock,"Pros:-Easy to use-Slim and lightweightCons:-Not a heavy duty lock by any means; looks like it could be cut easily-You can pull on the lock while turning the dials, and if you hit the right combination it will pop openIn short, it's a decent deterrent lock but don't expect it to provide any real security."
2,Disappointed,It takes me a total of 15 seconds to crack the combination to this lock. I wish it were harder for someone to crack. I wouldn't trust this lock to secure anything... anywhere... Probably only use it to keep something closed.
1,"Garbage, junk, don't waste your money",I bought 3 of these locks and one of them quit working on the first use. These are complete chinese junk and do not waste your money on them. I also purchased a Sesamee brass lock and it is made in Taiwan but seems to be a decent lock.
1,another loss,"I have to add my voice to the group of dissatisfied users. After about my 10th visit to the locker room the lock got stuck in open position, presumably because it got reset. At least it got stuck open, not closed. But it's going in the trash."
1,SO MADa,"I set the lock and it was working perfectly after I got it yesterday... I put it on my gym locker today and now it won't unlock and the manager is coming to cut it off (I'm at my university gym thats why I have my laptop). DO NOT TRUST or BUY, I'm not some dummy, I put it on my locker and now it will NOT unlock. I am going to go home and request a refund immediately, I am very disappointed."
1,Absolute Garbage,"This lock is an absolute piece of garbage. It is light weight and flimsy. The ""combination"" changes repeatedly, leaving you to struggle each time you open the lock what numbers will work. This happened to me twice on the same day. I gave up and threw it away. Don't waste your money."
1,Resets too easily AVOID product,"We bought this lock and after only 2 weeks of owning somehow we also ""reset"" the lock to a new unknown combination, now we can't lock it (or open it if we did lock it). We can't figure out how we so easily reset the combination and we have no way of knowing what it was set to. We consulted MasterLock's website to discover this lock can only be reset with the working combination.... that is the problem, we don't know it, and yes, the lock is open.Hopefully, I can get a refund from the store. Seriously... don't bother buying this."
1,Horrible Lock,This lock broke after 1 month. wouldn't open. I finally got it open and then it wouldn't lock anymore.Not recommended and i cant return it- since i missed the return window after a month.my opinion- don't buy
5,Great Lock!,Works as described and is a perfect fit for my gym locker! Strongly recommend it to whoever wants to have their stuff secure.
2,Price puffing with Amazon product placement,"Twice the price of the competition, and sold by Amazon.Why? Because it is the only one that shows up in the initial search, and buyers overlook the fact that other prices exist."
1,Lock Fail,Used 5 or 6 times on my gym bag on visits to excercise. Broke after the second week. Not recommended to be sure!
4,Solid lock,I find this lock to be very useful for the gym. I have noticed that you don't get the satisfying click when you actually lock the lock however it's very secure
4,Working well on my garage door,"Been using it for a few months on my garage door, and it has been working fine for me. I see a little bit of rust building up, but it doesn't seem to be affecting the lock."
3,A basic lock,"For the few dollars we paid for this, this was great. All we needed was a lock to secure our jacket and keys at the gym so this was perfect. If you need this for anything more secure I would say to keep looking as this serves more as a deterrent than actually protecting. It's a bit of a flimsy lock and you can almost hear it click into place when you enter in the code so if you have a persisten thief, they'd eventually break into this thing."
4,alternative combination lock,"This lock is a good alternative to the traditional combination locks, fit great on regular locker, however, because of shackle size, didn't work on phy-ed locker, so, may not fit all lockers?"
1,Shoddy,"Easy to cut, and it's *way* too easy to accidentally reset the combination, thereby rendering the lock useless. I ended up having to clip the lock off my locker because of it. I would not recommend this lock to anyone."
1,Why didn't I listen??,Worked great for 2 days... Now the lock doesn't open...this lock is total garbage!! Listen to the reviews! I wish I had.
1,High mortality rate,"The best feature of the lock is that you can use a word of your choosing, and not a string of digits. If you never plan on having wet hands or exposing it to any moisture it could last you longer but I wouldn't bet money on it.After two months of daily usage this lock froze on my locker at the gym and had to be removed by staff with bolt cutters. Not really a big deal as much as an annoyance.I assumed it was a fluke and bought another one from a local retailer. It has only been a month and the ""action"" is already becoming very sticky on the combination wheels and I can tell the exact same failure is looming around the corner.A little moisture and possibly pomade residue exposure is all it takes to cause this lock to fail within a short timeframe, which I find to be fairly ridiculous. Save your money and time and avoid this lock."
3,"Good lock, but","This was a nice lock, but it took no time to rust. I actually really like the style of the lock, just wish it had done better outside."
5,Solid!,It;s a solid lock that serves its purpose. Keeping others from opening my gym locker and walking away with my wallet. Its very easy to use and very sturdy.
4,Useful,"This lock is very useful and it's easy to set your own combination too. Just follow the instruction stated in the package. As others have mentioned, one inconvenient thing is that the lock won't close unless you close it with the correct combination, then mix the numbers."
4,witch,"Actualy that book is very informative, especially where it touches on the Vedic tradition and the work of Rene Guenon.Magical Christianity, Revised Edition: The Power of Symbols for Spiritual Renewal with a CD of Guided Meditations"
1,No scientific or other value whatever,"John Major Jenkins has long ago given up reviewing facts. He just makes it up as he goes along. The so-called galactic alignment is an event that requires 18 years to pass. The true galactic alignment occurred sometime in 2003. No disaster then. He prophesies events that will occur, and even as he puts them forth there is no basis for the conclusions he would have you reach. Things he claims will happen on this galactic alignment have never happened in the past galactic alignments (over 100 since homo erectus). Science is completely ignored. This is nothing but an attempt to get the weak minded A&E watchers to spend money on his books. Between shoddy science and poor writing, why bother?"
1,"Pseudo-scientific, money-grubbing garbage","Oh, please. Why do people have such a desire to return to the Dark Ages, when everyone believed that you could turn lead into gold, and that the sun revolved around the Earth? Saying that the ""galactic alignment"" is going to affect the Earth is like saying that dropping a pebble in a pond is going to cause a tsunami on the other side of the planet. The galaxy is too huge, the distances too great, for there to be any affect whatsoever. Try adding up some numbers. There are so many truly amazing things in the universe to discover and marvel at, why do people fall for charlatans like this who only want to take your money? I am disgusted and outraged."
4,truly a flash back,"I have waited eagerly for this dvd. I have not seen this program since I was a child, and while it does not quite live up to uncritical childhood memories, it is ,in my estimation, still one of the best tv series I have ever seen. It was this program that helped lead me to take a philosophy degree, as well as to study the martial arts.From a more technical point of view, the quaility of the film stock seemed surpisingly good. I did notice in one scene where two tight face shots ( in the Tides) seemed a little cropped ( this is where perhaps the widescreen format may have been a hinderance), but on the whole I am grateful that I do not have to join the Warner video of the month club, and that I get to see the series that served as a stimulus for some rather valued aspects of my life.Now, if I could reflect of the flashbacks within the series, and practice hung gar more diligently, perhaps I cold get more out of life."
1,Kung Fu - The Complete First Season DVD,"I was really looking forward to watching these classic shows but when I saw they cropped the picture, I returned my set for a refund. The producers of this set must be insane. I'd rater watch bootleg VCDs than this butchered mess."
4,Get over it!,"Bruce Lee did not do the series, so what?It was a great show, David did a great job. I like Bruce as much as the next guy, but Bruce as a humble Monk, please!He was cocky, brash, and arrogant. Sure he could back it up, but I can't see him as Caine.I could be wrong but I am happy with Kung-Fu as is. Ok , they cropped it, but at least you can see on DVD. It could be perfect , but it's not, such is life. I think it's been a long time coming, I like it, I bought it. I am happy."
4,4 star review,"Very first movie of Kung Fu was great and David Carradine did a spectacular job portraying a Shalom priest being so humble yet, had the karate moves!"
1,Kung Phooey.....,"This series is a joke. David Carradine's kung fu is LAME and he is a really bad actor. He's half Chinese? What an insult. Bruce Lee was robbed of this role, and he could've mopped the floor with Carradine with one hand. Laughably bad and boring series. A disgrace."
1,Offensive,"I think this series is really offensive to Chinese people. It's a throw back to the days when they painted white people's faces with black polish. Only this was the 70's where that kind of blatant discrimination was thought to be over. Can people not see that David Carradine is NOT Chinese, even with their attempt at covering him with makeup to make him look like one?I'd say, boycott those who seek to profit from blatant discrimination."
3,Kung fu,"DVD's along with packaging were in good conditon, I am very pleased with my purchase and will buy again from amazon and the person selling used items."
1,Two-Sided Disks,"I had to return them because I use a carousel player which won't play both sides without removing the disk and flipping it which for a carousel is something of a hassle. I didn't care to buy two sets. Sometimes, Amazon Indictates when DVD's are two sided. Too bad they're not consistent in this practice so I can avoid returns."
3,Not the Complete First Season,"Although I have not watched all 15 episodes yet, I was disappointed to discover that a total of one to two minutes in each episode were cut. While the short scenes that were cut were not crucial, they do create noticeable gaps in the smooth telling of the story.It appears that the master tape used to make the DVD was not taken from the original series, but from a shortened version that was edited to make room for additional commercials when the show was shown in recent years. The total run time for each episode is 50 minutes.It is also not ""complete"" because the top and bottom of the screen have been cut to make it fit a widescreen format.I purchased the DVD because, although I had recorded the series on VHS, I did not have all the episodes. Therefore, I am happier with the DVD than without it; but I can only give it three stars since this is not the ""complete first season."" It has been cropped and shortened."
1,Not filmed in widescreen - Not the original aspect ratio,"Any prospective purchasers of this DVD, please note that the orignal series was filmed and broadcast in a 4:3 screen ratio. To accomodate the 16:9 ratio of widescreen TVs, the image will be cropped, losing image (about 25%) from the top and/or bottom of the screen. If the series were presented in its correct 4:3 ratio, there would be black or gray bars at the right and left of the widescreen TVs ... Warner is probably trying to avoid complaints from viewers who don't realize that this is the only way to correctly present the original image as filmed and broadcast. Warner's would better serve fans of the series by presenting it as originally filmed and broadcast and educating its customers that this is the correct presentation.Prospective buyers of this DVD need to realize that they will be seeing about 25% less image than was originally filmed and broadcast."
3,Mutilated version. Hope it's re-released properly some day.,"I was very excited to see Kung Fu finally available on DVD. It is one of my all time favorite shows, and watched them all when they orginally aired.It's hard for me to believe that the show has been mutilated by chopping off the top and bottom to have it in a letterboxed presentation.Here's some news for the folks at Warner Brothers: This show was intended to be seen in 4:3!. My widescreen TV will crop the top and bottom if I use the zoom feature (and I wouldn't use it to view 4:3 material). I don't need to be forced into it.I hope that the Metropolitan Museum of Art dosn't follow Warner Brothers' lead and start cutting the tops and bottoms off of paintings because wider frames become more fashionable.I'm throughly dissapointed."
5,Great show.....racism??,This was a great show but racism in the 'olden days' in hiring David Carradine and not Bruce Lee?? Just about every week the show was about the evils of racism and discrimination. I thought the character of Caine was half Chinese and half American and he looked that way to me. Just about all of the racist characters in the show were white male cowboys. Why would the show pick a main character because they were racist and then do a show against racism??? I'm buying it as soon as it is available.
3,"Good series, but wrong image framing","Unfortunately, the image framing is not original, and severely impacts the content of this memorable work.Whoever decided to alter the aspect ratio, basically missed the point of restoring and reissuing this or any other television series.Please reissue on Blue Ray at the original aspect ratio. Don't damage the work this way."
2,Cropping Dissapointing!,"When we talk about cropping about one third of the picture is cut out ( removed ) from the top of the screen and another aprox one third is cut away from the bottom.This means that in many scenes peoples heads and lower legs and feet are cut out of the picture where they one existed!In a Martial arts based series to have fancy foot work or arms reaching up being cut out is just flagrant stupidity!The film industry should leave the framing the way it was framed by the director and present the whole veiw, not a partial view to satisfy a perfect fit on a 16x9 widescreen TV, which the majority of consumers in the USA still do not own.To the Film studio's: Give Us the Complete picture! by presenting the original aspect ratio that picture was intended."
5,"Loved it then, love it now","I loved this series when I was a kid. I'd literally trip over myself to run home and watch it. I think it was already in re-runs by the time I was old enough to absorb it but it was still a long while ago and I loved it. WHen I saw the dvd I couldn't believe it, and bought it right away. I was worried it would have lost something over time, that it would have lost the magic. (Ie, Sergent Pepper was much more entertaining at 12 than 25..then it was so cheesy) But, it totally hasn't, its still just as enchanting, its such a wonderful show. Cain is such a wonderful, gentle character. And its also nice how he's so peaceful and gentle, but not a wuss. He doesn't act aggresive cause he chooses not to, not cause he can't. Now as the others said, where is season 2 and 3???? I want it NOW please!!"
1,disappointed,I tried to order this video series and was told it was in stock. I ordered and it never arrived. When I checked to see where my order was I was told in was not in stock and a credit was applied to my account.
1,Bruce Lee > david carradine,"Bruce Lee would have been perfect for this role. But bigotry was strong during the olden days and david carradine was cast instead. david's Kung Fu skills were weak and such a horrible actor. This movie gives a bad name to Kung Fu. If you really want to see some real Kung Fu, do your self a favor and pick up some Bruce Lee or Jet Li flicks. Save your movie and skip this one."
4,Awesome,"People seem to concentrate too much on the DVD quality, etc. and not the show. DVDs seem fine to me, and the philsophical quotes from Caine are as relavant today as they ever were.Rock on Caine. Can a movie be far behind?"
3,It's too small,"The quality of the sinkware is fine, but it is way too small. If you only have a couple things to wash, you will like this item. But if you have any pots & pans to wash, the space you need will be lacking."
5,Carpenters Rock!!,The Carpenters are very talented. The Volume 2 CDS are a fine example of the Carpenters songs. THey are very mellow and nice to listen to. I especially enjoy :Top of the World and Mr. Postman.
3,You can do better,"I am amazed that this particular title is still in print. The CLASSICS VOL. 2 collection was part of A&M Records' 25th Anniversary celebration and just months before, Richard had released the YESTERDAY ONCE MORE 2-disc set. Seeing no need to reformulate yet another set for the celebration, Richard & A&M simply re-titled and repackaged the YESTERDAY ONCE MORE set under this new title.Since then YESTERDAY ONCE MORE, which featured remixes of the classic tunes, has been re-mastered and re-issued again with an additional tune and slightly different order. As a result, you can get this same package in a better format for about the same money.As I said, although in its day this was a great package, you can do better. I'm amazed that it's still out there."
3,Nice puzzle and good quality,I bought this puzzle for my mother - the shipment arrived on time and in good condition. My mother said she really enjoyed the puzzle...it was hard enough that it was a good challenge to put it together.
3,"a good, solid read","This book by Curtis Beach is an excellent one which gives a lot of information about how the book came to be and the meaning of the book. Provides information on the book's creation and discusses the chapters and verses of the book in the light of the scholarship of the time.J. Robert Ewbank author ""John Wesley, Natural Man, and the 'Isms'"""
5,Great step back in time!,I use these as rc electric airplane launched fun items. I drop them from a servo operated drop door in a foamy trainer. Gets a lot of attention at field. Thank goodness they come in a twin pack as sometimes they fly out of sight!
4,Jetfire Twin Pack,This was purchased as a gift which has yet to be delivered to the recipient. At this moment I have to believe all is ok.
2,misleading,"their idea of a ""special protective packaging"" is the cheap cardboard case you see in the picture, it does not in any way protect the gliders and is less durable then a cereal box. on top of the fact that if you want to put it in the box you have to disassemble the gliders which can break them. as a customer i do not appreciate the false advertisement because the ""protective box packaging"" is why we bought these for our son and not another type."
2,Less tracks than original vinyl edition,"Dear gentlemenwhen I found this item, it was with a big enthusiam to hear some wonderful interpretations of the duo and all the extrordinary band (Cooper, Candoli, Perkins, etc) behind them, remastered on studio.However, I must reveal my disapointment when I found two tracks absent on it:- Into the dark &- Our love rolls on.Such kind of product that recovers expressive Jazz recordings shouldn't forget any remaining tracks from the original.This new edition should be considered as a recovery from that old one, with no faults.Anyway, I do recognize that I should have checked its containing track list."
3,Not enough moisture,"I bought these from target because of the awesome reviews here on amazon, and I love boots no 7. I must say, I wasn't wowed like I thought I would be! These wipes aren't very moist..leaving me to not feel refreshed at all. Instead I feel blah afterwards...like maybe I should take the entire step of washing my face instead of being lazy.. Also, they are really rough in texture. My skin is pretty sensitive and these wipes feel scratchy. Yes, they remove makeup, but so do other wipes! Basically, I'll go back to my ""yes to cucumber"" wipes as soon as I finish these :("
3,meh,"handy to have around, but a little rough on sensitive skin. I would not recommend for removing eye makeup."
3,More Care Should Have Been Taken With The Writing.,"Oliver is confined to a hospital bed due to a broken leg or foot, in traction, yet is enjoying his uneventful days away from Stan until the latter's visit, ""...Because I had nothing else to do"", bringing Oliver a lunch that Stan eats and causing havoc when he lifts the truss weight, raising the patient above the bed while simultaneously hurling a doctor, played by Billy Gilbert, through a window; this type of physical comedy is generally inferior to the antic pair's careful buildup of mated tension that is manifested facially, of which there is too little in this carelessly organized short feature that is additionally impaired by a lengthy climactic section utilizing poorly done rear projection and deficient matching of film stock; there is far too much ""business"" in this one, and not nearly enough of the strengths of Laurel and Hardy."
4,wooden cups,"Kind of pricey, but made very well and fun to serve sake in...they give off a pleasant cedar-like aroma when drinking out of them"
3,These leak a little and aren't the greatest quality,"I ordered these to plant paperwhite bulbs in. The wood is glued a bit unevenly on some of the cups. They are also leaking a bit when I water the bulb. I realize I am using them a bit unconventionally; however, cups are meant to hold liquid. They were a great price and were shipped in a timely manner. I'm just disappointed with how crooked and unevenly put together some of them are. They are a bit loose at the seams. They definitely shouldn't be leaking."
5,Great!,Item was just like description! Fast shipping!! Thank you so much! I know I will enjoy this book! Love love love the author!!
1,No one cares,I never received this book from the seller and despite several e-mails was unable to elicit a response. I give up. They have a one star rating because I was unable to go any lower.
1,Doesn't work,"This cable did not work - there was a loose connection that caused loud static noise whenever it was jostled. As far as I'm concerned, a cable is either 1 or 5 stars, and this gets 1 since I had to replace it."
1,Absolute crappy cables,"I bought 3 of these cables and they worked out end the first week. But after the first week, the cables broke and could not play any sound for some reason. Very disappointed."
2,Broke after 5 months,"This cable worked fine for a short while. I didn't put it through much abuse and the jack developed a break. The price was good and I have no complaints about it otherwise, but be wary of this jack design. There's no repairing it unless you buy a new jack and solder it yourself."
1,Shorted out the 2nd time I used it,"Based on the number of positive reviews, I bought the 20ft right angle version of this product to use with my Fender Jazz bass. When I received the cable, I was a little concerned about the light gauge and feel of the cable.. but hey, it got great reviews.. so why not? I used the cable last night and my signal faded ... repeatedly. I wiggled the cable and got the signal back, then it happened again.. no signal. I pulled put several of my backup cables and tried them all and had no loss of signal or cut-off. I tried this cable again. Same loss of signal. I'm returning this cable, as I can't even recommend this product as a backup cable since it is unreliable."
3,"ok cables but I don't think I received ""planet waves"" brand cables.",The cables work and do what they're supposed to do but they do not have the logo design shown on the picture leading me to believe these weren't even planet waves cables.
4,"Not Heavy Duty, but gets the job done well","I bought this for my husband to use on a practice amp at home, all of the cords we have at this point are planetwaves. They are great and last forever, the ones we bought prior from guitar center are more solid , but this works perfect for beginners or just playing around and at a lower pricepoint who can complain."
4,Do it!,"This product works great, has a clean sound and is well made for the price. I recommend this if you are looking for something good to practice or carry around without worry too much about losing it or whatever."
3,It's okay,This cable just deserve an okay review. It's usefull but is just a simple cable it seems that requires careful handing.
3,Ok,"Not the greatest cord I have ever used, not the worst either. I would prefer Fender Tweed cables over this one if I had to make a recommendation."
2,Big volume loss between this and 6 foot cable,"I have both the 20 ft cable and several 6 foot cables. There is a BIG volume loss when using the 20 foot cable. I expected some loss, but this is almost to the point of being unacceptable. If my amp is normally at 2 (out of 10), I have to crank it to 4 or 5 with this one plugged in to get the same volume."
2,Too Cheap,I've been playing out for 20 years and this is the first time I've had a cable go bad so soon. Had it about 6 months and I usually keep them for years.I liked it untill it broke.
5,Works really well.,"No problems here at all. It works without any hum. I'm not a good musician, so I can't tell any of the finer details. But I plug it in and sound comes out."
4,Cable Review,I got this for my daughters guitar and this cable is the toughest cable for guitar I have seen/delt with. It is wonderful and especially tough for kids!! Good buy!
4,not bad,Great practice cable for the price. It stands up to moderate abuse and I like it better than the screw-end type.Wouldn't hesitate to buy another one.
4,good cable for the money.,"A good cable for the money. Could have better stress release, but certainly plenty good enough for normal use and a very good value."
5,Great Cables,"Simply, these are great cables. They snap right in, carry sound well, and come with a lifetime warranty. The 15' length is just about right, and at about one dollar per foot a good value. Recommended."
5,Surpisingly good,"For the price this cable is sturdy, flexible, and no well-made all around. It's long enough for my use, but it may not be for some. Check to see if 10' is what you need."
1,Disappointing,"When I first picked this book up, I was very excited. I'm extremely interested in learning about the practical design issues involved in creating more sustainable cities. I was disappointed by how little the author focused on practical engineering issues and concrete examples. Instead, I found fuzzy philosophy and strained analogies to the Big Bang and evolution. I'm a tree hugging, environmentalism kool-aid drinking hippy, but give me a break. The author wants to use cosmology as a rationale for his design philosophy? I recommend passing on this one and reading Natural Capitalism or Plan B 4.0; those two books present concrete ideas and solutions rather than rambling around without actually saying anything."
3,"Good ideas, not for reality","This is very well written book where if the topic is not so stichy as a novel, the author is able to mae it follow with non_stop. I used for having a wider view of the problematic with the cities and i think it gave me a very complete and detailed picture of it. I specially like when he proposed the proressive evolution of the urban spaces. In conclusion, a very good book whem discussing in the idealistic field but without proper technical knowledge for making it happen."
5,good for soups,"I bought this after seeing it on Rachael Ray's 30-Minute Meal show. It is very good for cooking certain soups because the oval part helps you to move meat away from the heat when you have browned it and want to focus the heat on something else, then put it all together at the end and put the lid on, it cooks thoroughly. I can put this in the dishwasher - sure the bottom stratches, but I have an electric stove, so all the movement is going to make it stratch. I'd recommend this to anyone. I bought one for my mom for Christmas. she loved the way the soup came out of this pan, taste wise and cook wise."
2,Not what I expected,"I had wanted this pan for a long time and when I bought it I was really dissappointed. I think the depth of the pan has been shortened...think it used to be 4"" and is now 3-1/4"". The reason why I say this is on another online shopping service I buy from has the same item and it is 4"" in depth. I have the matching oval pasta pot and really love it but I am not happy with this purchase. It is a nice pan but when you are making a big dish you need a big pan to hold it. Shame on Anolon for cutting it down."
2,Awkward,"This product looked like it would be a good fit for my new stove's oval burner but when it was placed on the stove, I realized it would be very awkward. Placing it on the oval burner did not allow the pot to be turned. The handle stuck out way too far in front & it was heavy to lift with only the long handle. Perhaps on a regular burner this pot would be fine, but I have other pots for regular burners. The only thing I really liked was the lid! Wish they could offer that option with the 8quart Oval Pasta pot, which I did purchase and love!"
1,Awkward...,"...is the only way to describe this. The shape is unpleasant and doesn't conduct heat properly. The handle is too mushy (like the hot dog mentioned in another review) and makes for dangerous transport of hot things. I felt as if I couldn't get a proper grip on it at any time. Worst of all, I've only used it a few times and the interior coating is coming off. Please buy some real cookware!"
2,cheap cd,first off the lovin spoonful on amazon are all just best of cds they have about 2 original albums that sell for about 7 bucks each. the only two good songs on here are do you belive in magic and summer in the city besides that though just 2 minute love songs that get incredibly annoying plus do these guys need ANOTHER greatest hits... This one is another one of those old hits cds that are out of print because no one buys the stuff plus the cds only 25 minutes(my version has 10 tracks) thats it...2/5 stars
4,good wipes,It is very convenient . Resealable package is good. The only problem is that the scence is too strong for those people who does not like too strong scence.That is why i give it 4 stars instead of 5.
4,Strong Country Blues From the Elder Stateman,"This is a slower, more pastoral and acoustic entry from the elder stateman. He does a lot of finger pickin' with his top-notch band, and the songs reflect the happier state of mind he was evidently in at the time. ""Don't Waste My Time"" is a standout, as well as ""Don't Pick A Flower.""Mayall's slightly off-pitch singing takes some getting used to, but this is well worth a listen and I am glad they finally re-released it on cd."
4,Good swab!,The clarinet swab works much better than I though it would. Good buy for the price and i recommend it for the price.
5,best cleaner and polish for wood,"This scent is not available in stores in my area. I originally purchased a carton of it for the fine wood tables and chairs in my office building. Soon after, the cans started disappearing from the custodian's cart. I had to put it under lock and key and dole it out as needed. It cleans beautifully and leaves a shine that everyone agrees is noticeably brighter and longer-lasting than any of the other cleaners that had previously been used. There is no wax build-up or cloudiness. It is more of an oil. And the scent - so lovely! One of our beloved custodians retired and asked if I could get her a couple of cans as a gift! I now make personal purchases for myself and friends - it's that good. It's the best cleaner and polish for wood that I've ever used."
4,AUTO LAPTOP CHARGER,"PRODUCT WAS WELL BUILT AND WORKED AS ADVERTISED...ONLY NEGATIVE SHIPPED WITH NON AMERICAN STANDARD FUSES, MAY MAKE REPLACEMENT DIFFICULT..."
3,knife,"not terribly impressed with the service, however the knife holds an edge better than others I have owned"
5,Snakeman,"I love this game. I also like megaman 2 & 4. They are very fun. This time your robots are Sparkman, Snakeman, Geminiman, Topman, Magnetman, Needleman, Hardman & Shadowman. This also has awsome music including Snakemans & Needle mans stages. This was the first one with rush & Breakman. This was the only time megamans brothers name was Breakman. <His real name is Protoman> I cant wait till Megaman Anivarsary collection gets released for Playstation 2. I like Toadman, Snakeman & Drillman. Toadman is starting to be my favorite. He has a great weapon. Its called Rain flush & it gets rid of all the badguys on the screen. So far I dident really like Megaman 5 & 6. It wouldnt be a good idea for me to get any of these 2. I hered the serise started to get worst when they made megaman 5. These reviewers were right too complain. They were pretty frustrating. I hardly beat a boss. I dident play Megaman 1 &7 in awhile & dident play megaman 8 yet. I also have both seasons on dvd. I watch them on weekends."
3,Not the best,"... This disc has the same mindset of ""Soundtracks For The Blind"" by Swans, after all the way to produce the record was the same: cut-ups of grooves, drones, and other sonic fragments that Mr. Gira collected over the years... but this disc is a little ""anonymous"" in front of other great works with the same experimental vein as the Swans' record I would reccomend much more instead of this one (and still I'm a great fan of Mr. Gira!, but for this I can find more interesting experiments in ""Soundtracks For The Blind""!!!)."
3,Brake hoses,"Typical high quality from Russell however, the rear hose is shorter than the factory hose. This causes a problem (without first modifying the factory mounting) when the rearend is at full down position."
2,confused,The product comes in a bag as what looked like a pile of nylon. No instructions for assembly so you are on your own trying to put it all together. I still have not actually used it after 3 months.
4,A good present,I offered this book to a friend who is into film production. He seemed to be really satisfied with the book content...
2,More Administrative than Technical,"This is a fine book for what it is (which is not what I expected). I was shopping for a technical handbook and what I received was an administrative handbook. Its good information, but its highly focused on union rules, expense reports, time tracking, securing permissions etc. Almost half of the book is a compendium of paper forms you can photocopy and put to use.If you're looking for clarification about work-rules or are interested in expediting the compliance aspects of film making, this is a terrific resource.WPH"
5,GREAT!!! so much to learn!,"It is quite a great book! I learned so much, and i learned where to learn more, after reading this book i came up with new doubts, and im solving them now. If you are serious about making a movie, this is a must have, this and other more."
5,invaluable,"As a filmmaker, I refer to this book regularly and always find it to be a great help. You will never regret buying it -- a bargain at twice the price."
3,shying at trouble,"Carole is still obsessing over Samson, to the detriment of her grades, other stable work, and relationship with the Saddle Club. Lisa and she aren't speaking, ever since Lisa found out that Carole had been keeping the secret of Prancer's pregnancy from her. And A.J.'s still acting weird, so the club and their friends have set up a confrontation. I agree with the other reviewers that it was a little too rough, though perhaps necessary."
1,Boring,"This book was almsot exactly like the last one. It was just an extension of all the problems in the last book. Only one problem, AJ, was somewhat resolved. But Bryant, even when she has enough unresolved sub-plots and plots to make plot soup, she creates even more plots. I think she's afraid of letting ill befall on her characters, and that's why nothing ever happens to them! Well I say enough is enough! I'm tired of hearing these characters think ""but on the other hand,"" or, ""still,"". These books are going nowhere fast. Bryant needs to rethink her plot line soon, and resolve a lot of these plots, or else she will be left with a bunch of tired plots, overacting characters, and no readers."
4,I'm glad I bought it,My bike pump plastic bracket broke a long time ago and I had been carry it in a fanny pack. This one serves the purpose well. It a little more cumbersome to remove/insert the pump that a rigid plastic bracket that fits on the frame screw holes.
2,"Great Bag, BATTERY is NOT INCLUDED","I love the bag, but did not receive a battery. I called Amazon and my only choice was to return the bag. When ordering the bag, I thought I seen that it was coming from Antonline, (whatever that is) I have not found a way to contact them. I was told by Amazon that I would have to contact HP. I called but today is Jan. 01 and of course all I got was automation."
1,Bag is ok,"I purchased this from Amazon based on the description that a long lasting rechargeable battery was included. However when it arrived, there was no battery. Upon questioning Amazon about the battery, the customer service rep said he could give me a $5 credit for the batteries. I asked how the battery could only be worth $5. He said that is what AA rechargeable batteries go for. The bag is ok, but don't order this if you are expecting a battery specifally made for compact printers."
2,Portable printer carrying case,"The case is cheaply made, I doubt it will last a year. Touted as roomfor your printer and extras, it ha space for the printer, power cord , a couple of ink cartridges ( out of the box) and the printer, the single tiny interior pocket will not even hold a package of photo paper (50 sheets). The case is soft and offers little protection from contact or falls, even short ones. Perhaps the ""Metro"" case would be better. Who knows?"
1,"Where's the fricken battery, crooks!!??","As with other reviewers, I did not receive the battery that was supposed to be included with the case. In fact, I didn't even receive the case that was pictured. The case I did receive was the case I had originally planned to buy so it's a keeper. I am assuming that the batteries are being removed from these cases and sold seperately to increase profits. Buyer beware."
2,It lacks energy,"Although the band is very competent, there is something strange in this album. The performances lack energy; maybe it's the lack of overdubs, and this is how a live album should sound, I don't know... But it's only for completists."
4,Great live set from Bryan Adams,"This live album is very good, the choice of songs could'nt have been better. Almost every hits from ""Cuts like a knife"", ""Reckless"" and ""Into the fire"" are there in their live version, plus few extras songs. Some really good live versions of Mr Adams's hits at that time. You can't go wrong with this one if you like Bryan as I do. It is what we can say, an excellent best of....in live version."
5,Much better than the OEM battery!,"If the OEM battery in your Panasonic portable phone keeps dying after only several minutes of talk time, just buy this replacement. It lasts plenty long, I've talked for two hours on it without problem."
1,"Buyer Beware! Energizer, Technuity and Audiovox ER-P511","Buyer Beware!The all BlackER-P511, typically shown, may very well be an inferior Jensen,JT-141battery with a Black Energizer logo / band directly over the Blue Jensen logo/sticker. I took two apart, and that is the story. The JT-141, 1500 mAh talk-time is about 1 hour, which is significantly less than the all Black covered (typically shown) Energizer.Moreover, Energizer referred me to Audiovox, who also services Jensen products, regarding this product, and I got very negative customer satisfaction from them."
1,Mislead,"Amazon web site confusing. Searched on one particular battery and it gave me 3 or 4 so I took the highest capacity. Result = wrong battery. Now I have to deal with a third party vendor somewhere in the bowels of Brooklyn to return and get a refund. Unpleasant. Amazon, you can do better than this."
4,Midwest Hardrock with Southern Rock feel,"Midwest, mid 70's hardrockers that are not really Zeppelinesquese, more Southern rockers with Allman's like Dual leads, and some Skynyrd crunch.When push comes to shove the vocals and the guitars have a 70's hard rock sensibility giving the songs some punch and excitement.A nice overlooked US 70's hard rock album for those hungering for more beyond Aerosmith, B.O.C, Nugent, etc."
4,Permatex Ok but could be better,"Hi,I bought these gloves because of the name, thinking they would be great mechanical gloves. Well they were OK, but I'm trying other brands."
4,"Interesting and entertaining, just not long enough","I think fans of the show will enjoy this. You get to hear about how the actors first heard about the show, the auditions, and some of their own perspectives on the show's story. Unfortunately, with so many important characters, you only get to hear a tiny bit from each actor. It would have been great if this was two or three hours so the actors would have time to get into more detail."
5,The Best of the Series,"Kate Ross's death of cancer in March 1998 was a tragic loss and I'm saddened that we'll never have a new Julian Kestral mystery to savor. Of Ross's four books, ""Whom the Gods Love"" is my favorite not only for the extraordinarily vivid personalities Ross created, but for the slow and increasingly horrifc revelations about the victim's character. This is a masterful novel and can, should, must be read."
4,must read,"As a nurse, i found this book to be an eye-opener. It is a must read for anyone with a child or who works with children or for anyone in general who has a concern. I found that I was quite taken by some of the chapters & found them quite informative. The information on how to identify sexual predators was most helpful. Those in medical, will fine this book most helpful, when dealing with questionable situations/settings."
3,Great tool for light in the tent,"There's nothing bad i can say about this mini-lantern. I don't love it, i don't hate it either. I only use it inside of my tent since it's not bright enough for anything else."
5,Good little lantern,"Although my sister got her power back (from Irene), she hung the lantern from the top of the stairs where she really needed light and loves it. Great too, because when all the D batteries are gone from the stores, this runs on A batteries (I think double A's). Have to get one for myself and rest of family for next blackout!"
4,Tiny-mite lite,"This is a small lantern. It fits in your hand is really adequate for personal use and not to replace a larger lantern. Small, sturdy and stable with the clever swivel out stand. It's just right for camping, backpacking and even to keep in your desk. I opened mine in the office and everyone wanted one so I bought a couple more."
1,A little light,"This is a very light treatment of Server 2003 clustering. It is poorly organized (there's not even an entry in the index for ""Quorum""!), and spends too much time on NT and Win2K (though the title says 2003). It is heavier on the design/planning side and very, very light on monitoring, management, and trouble-shooting. It often gives advice without providing reasons. There are several key points delivered in a grammar so poor as to make me wonder what he is trying to say. All-in-all, I learned nothing that wasn't obvious in Microsoft's own documentation."
2,"Semi-accurate technical content, extremely poor writing.","This is without a doubt, the most poorly-written technical reference I've ever had the displeasure of reading. I agree with the other reviewer who picked out the numerous Windows 2003 Server errors - this book was rushed to press, and should have waited for the final release instead of being based on RC2.I cannot believe a professional editor gave this book their stamp of approval. I have to take breaks every dozen or so pages, not because the concepts are too difficult, but because the author's akward sentences make my head ache.Unfortunately, this seems to be the only book on the subject. I would stick to using whitepapers and web resources."
1,Some glaring windows 2003 errors,"I had high hopes for this book however there are some glaring errors that make me wonder if the author truely tested the 2003 cluster environment. For instance in setting up MSDTC he tells us to use comclust.exe which is the 2000 way. This does not work on windows 2003. Also the book doesn't address the fact that sql 2000 will not install on 2003 as a virtual server without errors, and that a client alias work around is necessary, along with sql SP3a. All of this was a fact even on the beta and rc2 version of windows 2003 he used for the testing. If find it hard to believe the author has ever done a real sql 2000 cluster on windows 2003 outside of a testlab and without named instances(which are fundamental to production sql cluster, especially active/active)."
5,Great Krav Techniques !!!!!,David Kahn's Mastering Krav Maga is the go to DVD for anyone wanting to learn the essential techniques of Krav Maga. The techniques are presented in a easy to understand format demonstrated with pinpoint accuracy. You wont be disappointed.Scott Hewitt
5,Best Krav Maga video set I've seen,"This is the best Krav Maga DVD set I've seen to date. David Kahn is not only knowledgeable about the subject, he's very good at presenting the material in an easy to understand and apply fashion. The production values and editing aren't the best, but the information is outstanding. This set is a great compliment to David's three books on Krav Maga, which I also can't recommend enough."
3,This isn't really an instructional DVD set,"David Kahn is a beast. Not the most charismatic instructor, God bless him. He has some great how-to's that could be used to augment the game of a novice combatant or seasoned self defense junkie. Don't be fooled though. This is not a DVD set where you are given step by step ""belt requirements"" and drills. Yes there are plenty of ""drills"" and yes there are some great moments of ""ooOOOoooh, that's pretty cool, but even David admits this was NOT intended as a beginner's user guide. Its a bunch of technique execution, some at full blast on the poor partner, which can be kinda funny. With that in mind, don't get me wrong, its a good expansive set of technical execution, but what I was after was a good ""from the ground up"" kind of DVD instructional."
3,wanted the how to,"after reviewing the first video, a little disappointed, I was hoping to be able to pick up some krav maga, but these videos seem to be advanced and you need to have some prior training, again I do say this with only watching the first dvd in the series. With some training I believe this would be an excellent review"
2,Krav MaGA TotallY Censored!!!,I'm learning some good moves but they are keeping the best techniques secret and they even admit it on disc one. Power to the PEOPLE is real national security. I want to know how to take on multiple armed assailants and real Krav Maga does that. This will help a little and is a good fitness program but they are hiding the real power of true authentic Krav Maga.
5,Great DVD.,"I would like to find a studio that teaches Krav Maga, but there isn't one that is close to where I live. This DVD set is the next best thing. I trusted the posted reviews, and they are spot on. I do recommend."
4,cool,Always been into Krav Maga. I think that you can pick up some basics from these videos. I think that it seems sometimes that they kind of made up what they would do as they recorded. I think that the video could have had slo mo for the moves because sometimes they go too fast and they move on. The screens with the words or tips on moves always goes by before I can read all of it and I am a pretty fast reader. All in all I think this set is pretty good.
5,Excellent resource.,"This set of six DVDs is an excellent comprehensive resource that I am using with my entire family. I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in Krav Maga at any level. David has also been kind enough to email me directly to ask about my experiences with the set of videos as well as offering to answer any questions regarding my training. That is a rare quality of service that I haven't experienced with other products and authors. If you don't have this set of training materials, and you are interested in Krav Maga, this should be your first purchase."
5,Awesome,"Simply fantastic. If a picture is worth a thousand words, these dvds are worth millions. Davy teaches Krav Maga with an easy to understand finesse rarely seen in any video on any topic. If you are a student of Krav Maga, these dvds are a must have."
4,Enthusiast in Training,"I have had the opportunity to spend Monday afternoons with friends breaking down these techniques and putting them into practice. none of us have official training to date (I plan to in the near future) and yet we had very little trouble putting many of these techniques into practice. we struggled in some areas to pick up on certain martial applications, but this is more due to our limited experience and lack of an instructor. many techniques such as bear hug escapes and elbow/knee strikes were very easy to pick up on. This video will not only give you excellent breakdowns of simple and practical self defense methods, it will help you to think like a kravist as well."
5,Great Series,"This is a great set of DVDs. I won't go into reviewing all the discs, etc. but will agree with one other reviewer that this is not a hold your hand instructional series. It is NOT a replacement for having a good instructor. A background in any other martial art is extremely helpful. I have been doing martial arts for a long time, not Krav, and have picked up many items that have made my skills better. BTW, it is recommended that you get the books that complement this series. Both books havs a lot of good material that can be read and digested at a slower pace.Lastly, I have to say the price is EXCELLENT value. There is tons of information that makes it well worth it.Have Fun, be safe,Brad BainSelf Defense Instructor: FusionMBS Martial Arts and Fitness"
5,The most effective Krav training out there!,"David Kahn's DVDs capture the most realistic, effective and combat-applicable variation of Krav Maga on the market...bar none! I have been a Kravist for a few years now and have absorbed a number of books, classes and videos from other masters (Eyal Yanilov, Darren Lavine, etc.). With all due respect to them as talented and experienced instructors, our tactical team is in violent agreement that David Kahn has hit the mark with his style and principles. We feel that if we had to reach out for a Krav instruction program for combat/tactical operations, we would choose David Kahn without a doubt! This DVD set captures the essentials and the most effective training compared to others on the market. This set is a must own for anyone who relies on Krav for their profession or any serious kravist. We eagerly await future DVDs."
1,No Alan stop fooling yourself,"Ever since I saw Alan in the owners box at a NFL game drinking wine and wearing a suit, I knew this was all just an act.This album is so sickly it doesnt deserve to be released. After working his (...)off on Drive, he seems to have decided well I can just about sing about any old rubbish and people will like it. Well the songs could of been written by a amateur, his voice is alright as awful but the slection that he has picked is terrible, save your money and buy hie early stuff instead."
1,Disingenuous at Best,"How could anyone believe that Alan is the most honest country artist ever ? That title would surely have to go to Hank Sr. That aside, the music that is offered on this record comes across as canned and mass manufactured. It is no secret that the blue jean wearing ""common man"" has long given over songwriting for singing what comes out of Nashville's songwriting factory. The truth may be hard to face, but Alan is just a singer, employed by a corporate record label, and he follows the orders of his producer so that he can make the money while it is still there. Only songs like ""Remember When"" will last for future airplay, and there are none like that on this record. Good Luck in the future Alan, but remember to sing songs that will last, not mass produced hits."
1,Sucks.,Really. I couldn't party to this album very well. Not much of a beat. Kinda sounded like a Truck commercial or something.Party.
4,Another Excellent Pefrormance From Alan Jackson,"First off let me say I am a lifetime Alan Fan. I own all of his albums. That being said I feel I should tell you up front that ""What I do"" is no groundbreaker. Alan sticks to waht he does best in this album. Writing love songs and country poetry that will put a smile on the face of the listener.Its not as good as Drive although I consider that a career record for Alan and it lacks the emotional depth of when somebody loves you but its music that is enjoyable all the way through.Best Trakcs: If Love was a river, Monday Morning Church, and If French Fries (if only for the humor value)Worst track: Rainy Day in June.The rest are decent and the result is a non essential Jackson release but an enjoyable listen for any Jackson fan or any fan of traditional country."
2,Alan called this one in,"I have a hard time finding the next single from this CD. Even the current single (Too Much of a Good Thing) is not that strong. I had this CD in my car player for a few days and it hasn't grown on me at all.Alan has shown that he can do much better. Most of the songs here are slow, only one or two up-tempo, and mostly, not that great."
1,A sad sad sad day for Alan Jackson,"This cant be Alan's new album, he wouldnt do an album of such crap, this is not the same work from someone who did Drive, he has gone too far downhill. I have to beg to ask, has he jumped the shark?I hope he doesnt release USA Today because that will kill his career."
1,Bring back the real MrJackson,"Its album like this that gives country a bad name, from the patheic Monday morning church to the embrassing, USA Today to the worst song ever If french fried were fat free, I am sad to be a country fan, when an artist of Alan Jackson's status does an album as poor as this."
2,Alan Jackson's What I Do cd,"This album is nice if you are wanting to listen to something light and slow and if you don't mind feeling like you've already heard this stuff before. Most of the songs sound the same and this is typical Alan Jackson stuff. I didn't feel like I was listening to anything new. There's very little fast tracks on this cd which was a disappointment. Alan has pened some great fast songs. I was looking to hear something that would stand out but never found it. Don't waste your money on a new cd, borrow someone else's if you are still curious to hear the cd."
1,Only One or two good songs,"Whenever I buy an album and do a review I think to myself how many good songs are on this album, if its half a dozen then its five stars, if its three or four then its three stars, if its only a couple then well its only one star.The thing is, not only will there be no hits from this album, it also contains his first song ever, ""USA TODAY"" are any other country fans tried of the same old songs from Mr Jackson, its seems hes just counting the money at this stage of his career."
5,ALAN DOES IT AGAIN.....THIS CD A MUST FOR YOUR COLLECTION!,"As usual, and as expected, Alan Jackson has done it again!! With his traditional country gentleman style to his ""pokin' fun at life"", Alan comes through again! Always true to his roots, Alan hasn't changed a bit, and thank God he hasn't! His songs are fresh and fun, sweet and romantic...what else could a person want or expect from THE BEST IN COUNTRY MUSIC TODAY!Anyone that doesn't ""get"" the song When French Fries Are Fat Free obviously hasn't heard many, if any of Alan's CD's. He's almost always added at least one ""funny, just to make ya laugh"" song on his CD's. So characteristic of Alan, the way he mixes it up on his CD's (and at his concerts!)!I LOVE IT, AND YOU WILL TOO.....A MUST, FOR ANY REAL ALAN JACKSON FAN'S COLLECTION! DON'T MISS DISMISS IT FROM SOME OF WHAT YOU'VE READ HERE.....IT'S WELL WORTH EVERY PENNY YOU'LL SPEND TO HAVE IT IN YOUR CD COLLECTION!!"
5,I WISH THEY HAD MORE,How can this go out of print? I gave these as gifts and I'm coming back to order more - so cute in a gift basket.
3,Holds the GPS but not so great at holding it to you...,"The belt clip holds the GPS button securely but has a somewhat narrow clip itself. Meaning that it will clip well to thin straps, etc but doesn't do so well on thicker or wider straps and can easily be knocked loose. Having your apprx $300 GPS fall off your pack onto the rocky ground isn't going to make your hike more enjoyable."
3,"Yes, breaks","I've broken 3 of these, twice when I didn't notice, and my GPS was on the verge of falling out. All times in winter, so cold may be an issue. Still I don't know of any alternative. I love how the clip works."
5,Perfect for my needs,Works great and my most frequently used fastening for the GPS.This simple connector gets moved from one pack to another.
3,It works,"I purchased this item because the original one that came with my GPS unit broke. I use this clip for about six weeks out of the year clipped to my backpack. It gets used frequently during the day. It fits my backpack and GPS unit wonderfully. I just hope the new one lasts a little bit longer than the old one. It was kind of my fault that the original one broke as I did not have my GPS unit fully seated into the clip, but live and learn."
3,could be stronger,"I am currently on my third one of these with my Garmin GPSMAP 60CSx. They last about two years each, being used for about 25 hikes per year. I have discovered that there are two primary places that they break. 1) The clicker that you push down to release it will eventually crack and break off. 2) The spring-loaded clip will crack and break too. I have been able to extend the life of this item by about 1/2 year by waiting to buy a new one until both pieces of plastic crack and break off. The GPS device itself is strong. I'm not sure why they didn't make the clip stronger too."
3,compatibility,It works well for me although other reviews state they can break if worn on a waist belt.I wear on backpack shoulder straps instead.Garmin has a list of compatible GPS units this will fit.You find your GPS portable on their products page and then click on accessories.Their website will reorganize time to time but presently the list ofcompatible devices is at:Amazon deletes URL links so I put in a partial URL(add a ps after the beginning htt below so the link starts out https before the colon)[...]
5,Escapades in German-Occupied Warsaw,"There are plenty of memorable scenes in this romantic comedy. Let's complement the other review. Maria hollows out eggs at their ends, fills them with ink, and then smashes them against German propaganda posters. At one point, one of the apartment dwellers doesn't know what the eggs at the table are for and, thinking that they are ordinary eggs, opens and bites into one! The surprise on his ink-covered face is priceless!Giuseppe doesn't just capture Maria's heart. He in effect takes over the apartment. He invites Germans to the apartment and then robs them at gunpoint of their guns. These captured weapons go to the Polish Underground. At one point, Maria's brother has had enough of Giuseppe's ways, and says: ""That Sicilian monster!""I first saw this movie as a child, and still remember these hilarious scenes."
2,Just OK,Harder on my feet than most high heeled sandals i've worn. And not as nice looking as the picture.
1,Too much theological BS,Just a big bore. No anointing on it. It's going to the local libray book sale. Maybe you can get it there.
5,Great Splitter!,This three way splitter out performed the skywalker two way splitter that I had used before. I guess I will buy this brand more often.
3,Works,"This splitter works as designed though the quality for an older model(same brand, 2-way) we were using was much better than this new one. The threads are of poor quality on the RCA VH48 Splitter(3-way), but viable."
3,Not what i needed,Its really my fault for not inquiring about the mhz. It works fine however the splitter could not produce hd picture through one television if three were connected. It does however work. I just need a 2 ghz splitter
4,Improved Signal,"Bought this to scale back from 4 way splitter, and glad I did because it improved signal strenght on all channels."
1,This splitter does not work with the new digital cable.,This splitter is not high quality enough to handle the new digital cable that our cable company is requiring everyone to switch to. I was told that when you purchase a splitter (from the Cable guy whom I had to call when I couldn't get it work) that you should not be able to squeeze it and have the back of it squish in. This splitter is not that kind. You can crush it in your hand. If you are using to split a digital signal then look for something else it will not work well enough.
3,3 way splitter from RCA,"I installed the splitter into my system and it seems to work fine, to early to know if it will last, the DB lost was minimal but then I have a booster ahead inline."
2,works... but poor signal strength,this product will work fine if you are just splitting cable signal to multiple tvs however if you are trying to use it for internet you may find the signal too weak and experiance slow disconnecting internet. had to replace with a higher quality splitter.
3,Splitter,got what I ordered but it wasn't what I expected it to be: wanted only to connect two different antenneas for one TV when the 'old' bradcasts were all converted to 'digital.' Didn't work out.
2,TV Crazinest,One of the holes of this brand new splitter was faulty so I had to use the the two remaining holes to hook up three tvs. I did it but felt like I did not have to. plus the all the tvs are still a little fuzzy.
5,3-way splitter,"Sometimes a person needs a splitter with a cable. When a person lives in a small town, the possible choices of where to purchase items is extremely limited and my option is usually to go to Amazon for my purchases. I am glad I have it and believe it or not, it works."
3,Potato Factory is a great read!,"I really enjoyed The Potato Factory. I found myself truly engrossed in the details of life in London and aboard the transport ship. While I didn't find this book to be of the same caliber as The Power of One, it was a great read and I found it hard to put down. I was a bit disappointed with the ending, though. It seemed like a lot of loose ends were wrapped up in a few paragraphs and left me hanging. While this may be a marketing gimic for the sequel, I thought it was a bit of a cop-out."
2,Depressing,I found this book very hard to read in parts as the author has included some very gruesome descriptions of certain events mostly portraying the cruelty of human beings.
4,Very good read,"This book is long, but goes very quickly. An excellent story teller and well written. I plan on reading the next two in the trilogy. You tend to get so absorbed you've covered 100 pages before you know it."
5,Very Interesting Story That Needs More Publicity!,"This story transports the reader from the South Africa of POWER OF ONE and TANDIA to Mr. Courtenay's new homeland, Australasia. The story is exciting and moving. A fantastic read. Don't forget to read the other two in the trilogy! Courtenay has lost his readership for some reason since the publication of THE POWER OF ONE his first book. It is followed by TANDIA. He also wrote THE POTATO FACTORY (of course), TOMMO & HAWK, and their final chapter, the third in that trilogy, SOLOMON'S SONG, which is due to be released in the rest of the world very soon. Other almost unknown works by Courtenay are: THE NIGHT COUNTRY, THE FAMILY FRYING PAN, A RECIPE FOR DREAMING and JESSICA. I encourage all of you who read this review to discover ALL of Courtenay's novels, not just THE POWER OF ONE. I do not know why he isn't more popular over here in the USA. Feel free to email to chat about Courtenay or collecting his books, of which I have many, many and some to spare!"
4,Great read!,"This is the first book of The Potato Trilogy, and I can't wait to read the rest of them. Bryce Courtenay has outdone himself again!"
1,HISTORY TWISTED TO ANTISEMITISM,"If I could, I'd give this 0 or fewer stars. Courtenay has taken the historical figure of Ikey Solomon-- a nonviolent fence-- and his heroic, faithful wife and bordelloed them, brutalized them, indeed conformed them to Cruikshank's drawing of Fagin in Oliver Twist (for whom Solomon is considered a main source). Courtenay's antisemitic subtext is so blatant that I, a non-Jew, was completely appalled by the text. BTW, there is a nonfiction book The First Fagin by Sackheim-O'Donnell that is a biography of Solomon; in later remarks, she blisters the Courtenay novel."
2,Tepid,"In fifty years these are the best fictional stories in motor racing? My God, what a pathetic statement. The first story in this book is quite good--gets you into the mind of a racer--but aside from that, most of the crap in this book is written at a level usually seen in a 10th grade creative writing class, bad enough, and is simply boring, boring writing about boring events and situations.Very sad state of affairs. If this is the very best, I am afraid to consider the quality of what's out there that's poor."
5,Stunning,"Jazz inspired live recordings of songs mainly from Stings first solo album The Dream Of The Blue Turtles"". The musicians are in best form and very playful. Most of all I like the medleys, especially One World (Not Three)/Love Is The Seventh Wave"". The songs are not only coupled to each other, but woven in each other. Mind-blowing! There is also a video of the same title worth seeing, about how this concert tour was made to happen."
5,One of the best live albums of all time,"If you have not considered Sting as a top class artist up there with the likes of Eric Clapton. Just to here him live without visual affects you will instantly agree he and his music are something very special. This album has all the qualities of a genius at work, setting the benchmark for other artists to follow. Yes I am a fan! Take a listen for yourself, see if I'm not right."
4,Bring it on!,"Sting has assembled a fine band for this exciting live album, and selected an interesting assortment of obscure Police songs and ""Dream of the Blue Turtle"" numbers. These versions of songs like ""I Burn For You,"" (wonderfully intense) ""Demolition Man"" (more accessible than the original record), ""One World"" and ""Another Day"" exhibit the band's good side. Somehow their onstage versions of ""Children's Crusade"" and ""We Work the Black Seam"" lack timing and cohesion in comparison, which seems odd, given that this was the band that had just done the studio versions. All in all, a good fusion jam."
4,One small complaint,"I, like most of the other reviewers really enjoy this set. I've owned it for over 20 years and every once in a while it still gets a play. It's aged well and Sting chose great songs and great musicians for this release. One thing I find a bit annoying about this live release however, is the fade out/fade in of most (if not all) of the songs. They apparently compiled this from several shows or something as there is silence between the tracks and it loses some of the energy being presented in this fashion - just one man's opinion. An example is ""Another Day"" This is a cool mostly-unavailable-otherwise track and it feels like we are missing a little of the song as it fades in and you definitely are missing some of the first notes."
4,What Gives?,"I just received a copy of this cd from Amazon. The music is a wonderful collection of Benny Goodman airchecks from the late forties. The only problem was the music on the disc in no way resembled what was printed on the cd case. There was no ""Red Horse Boogie Woogie"" nor any of the other titles listed. Instead I got ""Down South Camp Meeting"", ""Benny Rides Again"",""And The Angels Sing"",""Mad Man Boogie"" with Count Basie sitting in on piano, "" I Wanna Be Loved"", Remember"" and others.I don't know if I got a bummer cd or what. The music's great but not what I ordered. I wonder if anyone else had this same problem with this cd?"
4,Obi-Wan review,"I got this as a gift for my nephew, and he loved it! Of course, now my son wants it too. The Force Battlers are great for kids ages 4 and up, they're bigger than most of the other Star Wars figures - and they love that."
1,Not for motherboards with built in SATA,This SATA I controller card will not work if you have a SATA motherboard. Too bad I didn't know about this beforehand.
1,Customer support is useless,"Bought this card to run a Western Digital 1TB drive. Even though I was only using the new drive as storage my computer refused to boot with the card and the drive connected. Oddly enough, the card and drive work fine if the drive is connected AFTER the computer boots. (The drive is hot-swappable) After trying different PCI slots, flashing the motherboard and card BIOS, updating to all the latest drivers and several other things, it still won't boot unless the drive and card are disconnected. SIIG tech support says to just buy another card and ""try"" that. What about the brand new $37 card I have that has no reason to not work? Buy another $37 card and see if that works. Real helpful."
5,The best,"This is my favorite of Sting's albums. It took me a long time to get into it, but now I think that ""The Wild Wild Sea"" and ""When The Angels Fall"" are hypnotically beautiful. All of the other songs are good too."
5,infinite stars to the best album in human history,"there is not much praise i can add that others havent said already, and said well. this album was created with such depth and emotion in dealing with the loss of his parents that i doubt sting could ever duplicate it again if he tried. he also had the most perfect band at the time. vinnie colaiuta's drum work is beyond exceptional. you can feel and hear the waves crashing in ""the wild wild sea."" incidentally, that song is the finest marriage of poetry, song, and music there ever was. dominic miller's guitar work is subtle and unobtrusive, yet haunting and powerful. although the subject matter of the album seems dark, it, strangely enough, inspires hope, comfort, and a reaffirmation of life. the entire album is an emotional journey through songs, beginning in turmoil and resolving in peace. i am eternally indebted to sting for letting me share in that journey."
3,The un-soul ages,"3 1/2Sting eased his viable solo career into the 90's with this half smoothly lethargic, half slickly inspired continuation of refining his world-pop sensibilities in compelling adult contemporary."
3,"Enjoyable, But Average","The Soul Cage is an enjoyable, solid, but average Sting CD. The tracks lack the initial freshness of those on ""Blue Turtles"" and the sophistication and integrity of ""Brand New Day""."
2,the lesser talent of the Police goes overboard,"That's right--Sting IS the lesser talent from the Police. If you don't believe it, check out Summers's World Gone Strange or anything by Copeland, and compare it to Soul Cages. Sting is so overrated it's ridiculuous."
3,Sting's personal 'downward spiral',"This album is a remarkable departure from the playful jazz pop of its predecessors. However, I think ""The soul cages"" is an uneven affair and probably Sting's least enjoyable album. ""All this time"" is the only pop-oriented song, the other songs are 'difficult', although the music and the lyrics certainly have their moments. The ethereal soundscapes of tracks like ""Island of souls"" and ""The wild wild sea"" are lengthy and sometimes very lachrymose. On the other hand, the roaring guitars of ""Jeremiah blues"" and the title track sound forced and uninspired. With the exception of ""All this time"", the lyrics are real downers, with visions like ""there's a bloodless moon where the oceans die"" or ""you'll spend the rest of forever in the cage with me"". Hmmm, probably the perfect soundtracks for your next gothic-rock party. ""All this time"" is one of my favorite Sting songs, the rest of this album doesn't appeal to me. Sting better should have stayed at home with his sorrow."
1,Test of Time,"Re-ripping all my old CDs... This is one that didn't stand the test of time. Gushing reviewers and rich tapestry of music aside, I can't remember for the life of me why I bought this album--one for the revolving filing cabinet."
5,Dark but full of light...,"Sting proves that he is a music genious again. What an album...It's quite painful in some parts, but full of life in others. That ability to put all this diverse sound into one production is stroke of genious who Sting really is. This album was largely influenced by the death of Sting's father. You can hear it some tunes. The most interesting thing is that despite it's gloomy and dark sounds it's not depressive. Sting is on top of the world. He reaches straight to your heart."
5,A must have in any Sting library.,"I discovered this CD one night while babysitting. Seeing the name Sting reminded me of all those Police songs of my childhood. I slide the CD into the stereo, just out of curiosity, and what hit my ears was not at all what I expected. Never has music spoke to me so deeply and so instantly. Every song from the Scotish sounds of ""Island of Souls"", that takes you back centuries, to the contemporary and upbeat ""All This Time"" moved me in ways that I'm not sure how to describe.The grief, pain and confusion from which this albulm came is undeniable. From that night on I have been a loyal Sting fan and was thrilled to discover all his previous recordings. If not for this CD I might never have discovered one of the 20th century's most unique and versatile singer/song writiers.There could be no other name for this riveting collection songs except ""The Soul Cages""."
5,Strange case of album that improves with time,"This album is now almost 15 years old. When it came out, it was such a departure from previous works that it was a bit of a disappointment. Truth is that this album is just plain top notch everything and has the usually missing ingredient of pure inspiration and meaning. The production, the instruments used, the lyrics, the quality of Sting's voice, the packaging, the complexity of the songs, everything is perfect. It's non-commercial, artistic, romantic and that is what music should be.Sadly the forces of marketing can get to everyone, with Sting they took longer than usual, fortunately, before that happened he gave us all the albums up to and including Ten Summoner's Tales."
5,ONE OF STING'S BEST,"The Soul Cages is a definite must-have for any Sting fan. Among the true standouts is Mad About You, a truly intriguing ballad. Mad About You is one song you'll never tire of listening to, which is saying a lot...Although the entire album is great, the poetic richness of The Wild Wild Sea, Why Should I Cry for You, and The Soul Cages is sure to appeal to anyone who has even a passing interest in Sting's music.All in all, a great CD--with many songs you'll remember for a lifetime."
5,An Emotional Tapestry of Sound,"As the owner of the entire Police/Sting catalog, I feel qualified to state that this is the best album by Sting; indeed, it is the best album out there by anyone! Written as a tribute to his belated father, it is best heard in its entirety in one sitting. The music and lyrics are so rich and compelling, making me cry, smile, and even laugh. This album is what music is all about."
4,Professional Looking Pictures From Home,"I have tried several other brands of paper to print pictures on from home. NONE compare to the quality photos you get with this Canon Paper. They look as good as any pictures you get professionally developed at any store. As for the shipping charges, if you view the New and Used selections, you will find you ARE able to order directly from Amazon and recieve the free shipping, Amazon is just very slighty (LESS THAN A DOLLAR) more expensive, PLUS you save on shipping."
5,Excellent product,"I have used various grades of commercial paper, including Kodak. The Canon Pro is richer and has better contrast and depth."
5,Canon Photo Pro Paper,I've used this paper in my Canon iP4000 printer for all my digital photos and it has provided excellent results.
5,"Great photo paper, but high price.","I've wasted money on other photo paper (hp, jetprint, etc.). My photos came out grainy with vertical lines across the photo. But with Canon Photo Paper Pro, my photos came out perfect."
1,"Didn't work, filled the bathroom with a noxious chemical smell","Our bathroom floor has tiny white tiles with very dirty grout (it is almost white in some places and almost black in others). There are also rust stains on the tiles in some places. I don't know how long it has been dirty (we are renting the house and it was like that when we moved in).I was very hopeful about this product after reading the reviews. After receiving it, I sprayed it on a small portion of the floor that has rust stains and dark grout and let it sit for 30 minutes. When I came back, I couldn't see any difference. I scrubbed it with a stiff brush. Nothing. I wiped it off with a cloth. Nothing.In the meantime, the small amount I sprayed smelled so noxious that I began to feel ill after being in the bathroom for a couple minutes (we don't have great ventilation in that room).And all of this was after waiting for almost two weeks for the product to arrive.Very disappointing in every respect."
1,Didn't work.,"Sounds good, but didn't work for me. It thins out rather quickly and doesn't cling to the grout on tile walls. Have decided to purchase a professional steamer."
4,Good T-SQL Book,"This is the book I am looking for, I would like to recommand people to go to his web site first before saying anything about this book. Please take a look at the real world application!!.What I like the most about this book is that the way he shows me how to deal with stored procedure, triggers and use them with ASP pages. Plus he used command objects to execute stored procedure and how to pass some variables around either inside of stored procedure or ASP pages. Thanks Garth Wells. You did very good jobs. Mani"
2,Code-centric? Error-centric is more like it!,"I was excited when I got this book, but steadily more disappointed as I began to read it. After reading the first chapter or two, I started counting the coding errors and typing mistakes. I was up to 23 when I stopped. A lot of the code in this book simply won't run. What does is too simplistic to really be useful."
1,Borrows heavily from other books,"Not very impressed with this book. Almost everything in it is from somewhere else. Also, many of the techniques recommended are quite dated. Many don't even apply to SS2K. In fact, SS2K coverage is all but missing from this book. On top of this, there are numerous errors and typos. So, you have an unoriginal SQL Server book that's loaded with errors, quite dated, and lacks coverage of the most recent release of the product - not worth your money in my opinion."
2,Yet another shelfspacer,"I'm not sure what the goal with this book was, but it fails to deliver on anything positive. First, the coverage of the language as a whole is really weak. Whole subjects are completely glossed over. Moreover, if you're an advanced coder, you won't find anything you don't already know in this book. it's really for begginner's only, but as I've said, the beginner type coverage is really lacking. Worse yet, many of the examples are incomplete, tediously long (useless comments abound), and impractical. If you're looking for a good T-SQL book, keep looking."
2,Fuzzy Fabric Comes Off !,"I bought this because I love the look of it and thought my daughter would enjoy a personal sized blanket. It is a beautiful blanket and very soft but if your baby is a chewer, then the fuzz from the ""Cotton Candy"" blanket will come off in their mouth. Also, the satin border is much stiffer than I expected. I bought a Little Giraffe chenille blankie that I am much happier with now!"
4,luv em,"i absolutely love these shoes. the color, style, look are perfect. the only thing that i dont particularly like the is strap. theres a little button thing on the side thats a little elastic so you can get it on . so theres no actually strap to open or hook. but none the less they are pretty comfortable more so i noticed that most my other heels"
5,great entertainment,"My grandchildren ages 3, 4, and 5 loved this video. It is educational and entertaining."
4,GoDiegoGo,My son loves Go Diego Go! He watches them over and over. Great for addition to his DVD collection. He has watched this particular one so many times that he can tell you what is going to happen next.
5,Budgeting for babies,"This was a christmas item. Cheapest on Amazon, not available through site, sold out. Found on Amazon for 48% off retail, came on time, shipment affordable and I was lucky enough to get two. My neice and nephew love this and the adults had fun too. Great for teaching the babies the value of saving and budgeting. Very durable as it traveled down some stairs and works fine."
2,"ANNOYING TOY, horrible customer service with maker","This toy has an alarm type feature that I did not set and do not know how to access to turn it off. It goes off at 2:22 every morning. It wakes me up but my son isn't affected at all. This toy is loud and there is no way of turning the volume down. I tried to get a hold of the maker off their website. You can never get a live person, I left a message almost two weeks ago and still have not heard back."
2,Disappointed,"I purchased this for my 6 year old son for Christmas. It has the potential to be a fantastic and educational toy. However, immediately upon opening it, we discovered the automatic dollar bill feeder did not work. We hit the reset button on the back of the machine and the bill feeder worked for a couple of days, but then stopped permanently."
3,Deluxe ATM Machine,"This looked to be a good product for helping my little girl save money, but it didn't work right out of the box. It wouldn't allow us to set up a pin number so we couldn't do anything with it. I returned it the day after Christmas. I might have gotten a replacement if it would have cost $15 or so, but I don't feel it was worth what we paid."
5,My daughter loves it,I brought this bank for my daughter for christmas and she simply loves it. See was never really into money. when she got a birthday or christmas card with money in it she would just give it to me but now with this bank she keeps them and puts the money in her new ATM bank. I would suggest this bank for all kids.
3,HORRIBLY LOUD!,"Santa brought this ATM for my 7 yr. old son. For the expense, I would have hoped it at least kept track of how much you were depositing. You have to input that info. yourself. No big deal! BUT the noise level is out of control! Grates on my nerves everytime I hear it. There is no way to disable the DEMO button so everytime my 2 yr. old gets a hold of it, we have to listen to the Demo lady over and over until someone can go take it away from him! It's not a very educational toy in my opinion. Just a 'cool' way of storing your money. You also have to keep up with the ATM card which is probably easier for an older child instead of a 7 yr. old.Next time I will purchase the little jar thing from Discovery that actually counts your money as you put it in. ???"
1,Don't waste your money!,I bought two of these for my boys at Christmas. It was one of their top gifts that they wanted. It's February and both are already broken! The one didn't work right as soon as he opened the box. Very loud! Great idea but a piece of junk!!!
2,Daughter loves it parents hate it,"My daughter got the pink one for Christmas. She loves playing with it. Beware it has an alarm that the kids can set. The first time ours went off was in the middle of the night it sounded like a smoke alarm not great at 2 am. My other complaint is the volume is set really loud and there is no way to control it, comes with one volume. Other than that my daughter loves to play with it."
3,My own ATM,This little ATM is I believe a better version of the money jar but I expected it to be quit a bit bigger and for it to keep coins and bills separate but for the price it's a nice and fun way to save money even for grown ups
1,This product is Terrible,"I bought this bank for my son for Christmas after researching several types of electronic banks. He was so excited about it Christmas morning and was anxious to start using it. We followed the directions and noticed the display screen was so light it was hard to read. I changed the batteries but it didn't help. We ran into problem after problem from that point forward. Two different nights, in the middle of the night, the bank started beeping and it scared my son. I am sending it back."
3,Was ok for a couple of months.,"My child was happy when she received it. However, she kept loosing the ATM card and password. Then she broke it when she could not get her money out."
4,For those having problems entering the date,"My daughter received this for Christmas and like everyone else, I thought the keypad was defect because I couldn't enter the date. It would only take dates under ""11"" for the day, or so I thought. Until I figured out the date format was DD-MM-YYYY (Day, Month, and then year) and in America, we are used to entering the date as MM-DD-YYYY. In addition it was programmed not to accept any number higher than 12, in that MM field, hence the frustration of us parents trying to get this thing to accept 25, 26, or something like for the middle date field.So if you where programming this thing on Christmas, the date should have been entered like this 25 12 2011 . Hope that helps some other parent!Other then that the toy seems great!"
3,Will NOT keep others out because of reset button...,"I did not purchase this from amazon, but we have the same safe. I bought one for my daughter several years ago and after that one ran its course I bought one for my son last year. They loved them and they are educational and fun, but the problem is that the reset button on the back is accessible to everyone, including all of the neighbor kids that my son wants to keep out of his money and treasures! Although the code can be set secretly, all anyone has to do is stick a toothpick or other small, sharp pointed object into the back of the reset button and they can reset the code, which defeats the purpose of having it lock.The doors on both of ours always came off, too, but overall, they held up pretty good for as much as they played with them and it was worth it, but would be nice if they did something different with the reset button so that not just anyone can reset it at anytime."
4,It Came In PINK!,"I gave one of these to my 6 year old Nephew last year and his younger Brother wanted one this year. I ordered another one but it came in PINK! I realize it says ""colors may vary"" but you should be able to order one that isn't PINK. I had to go find the same item at a retail store because I couldn't take the chance that if I ordered again I'd get another PINK one. What are you supposed to do if it is for a boy???It is a great toy though. My 6 year old Nephew really enjoys playing with it."
5,Emily's Bank,ATM bank was a gift for an 11 year old. She loved it. Can change her PIN to keep her sisters out of it. Still enjoying it a month later...
5,Savings Goal ATM Bank,Grandson loves it! Gave to him for Christmas. He is 8 years old and is very excited! Excellent product! Thank you!
2,Savings Goal ATM,It Was just okay... it is made out of Cheap material. the money would get stuck or the card wouldn't work properly
5,10 Year Old Son loves it,It was requested for a birthday present last fall. He uses it as a safe for money and other treasures. He really likes it. Go figure! But it was a good purchase.
2,ATM Machine,"I purchase this toy as a Christmas gift back in September. My son actually loves it, however, it did not come with the ATM card. All I would like to do is request for an ATM card for this product so he can get the full enjoyment out of it. Please and thank you"
2,Doesn't really work well,"My eight-year old son bought this toy at Barnes and Noble with his birthday money. He was beyond excited to get it. Unfortunately, it didn't work well. Inputting the date didn't work. The enter key didn't work. The number 6 key didn't work. The sound effects were very loud. It doesn't recognize money-- you have to enter amount manually. He was very disappointed. I do not recommend this toy."
4,"Fun, Could be sturdier","We have two of these. One in pink and one in gray. They are exactly the same except for color.First the negative: you can easily break into the bank. The bottom 'safe' area that holds the cash is held to the machine with one little latch. If you get something into the corners at the top you can easily pop open the cash cupboard. It also has a reset button on the back so you can easily reset the code. This is a good thing for younger kids. This is not a good thing for kids who are worried about complete security. In addition to that the way it counts money means it can easily be wrong.Second, the positive: This is an educational tool for those kids who are learning to count money. It is also an easy way to store money and not loose it. It gives them some sense of security. It does have a reset button on the back should your child ever forget the password. This is not a cheap machine for the most part it is very sturdy.Worth the money.Enjoy."
2,Teller,Stop taking the money and keep resetting the light keep blinking the battery doesn't lasted and just not worth it
4,Billionaire in Training,"My six-year old loves this.He still needs to remember to type in the value of what he deposits and withdraws though. I have been going in and balancing it for him until he gets the hang of it.It is loud, but that's fine because it alerts me to the fact that he just found another dollar lying around. This toy will make parents very careful about dumping out the contents of their jeans, as all change left lying around is now swiftly deposited into said kiddie bank. :)Overall great toy, but I do worry a bit that the door won't last for long (kind of flimsy latch)."
4,"a really good gift, worth the money",I just bought it for my friend's little son. he really like it. I am happy he enjoy his christmas holiday!
5,Summit Zillions Deluxe ATM,Bought this for my Great nephew as a Christmas gift. Looks very realistic. Easy to use.
1,Broken,We ordered this... it came broken. The replacement was broken too. Thanks for ruining a little girls Christmas.
2,Had I checked it out before buying it I would have chosen something else,"This bank is not worth the price , the change fell out of the bottom as my son was carrying it to show it to me .the sound is very loud ."
2,Broken Display & Missing Volume Control,I ordered this toy for my son's birthday and wrapped it right after I received it. I should have checked it out before wrapping it because the display was broken (nice birthday surprise there). That didn't keep it from being obnoxiously loud without the possibility of any volume control ... but then maybe that was an option on the (not working) display.I appreciate Amazon's customer service for making an exception and letting me return the toy since I had it wrapped for more than 30 days and was outside the regular return window (lesson learned there).
2,Coins entered incorrectly valued,"I love the idea of this product. However, it incorrectly counts the value of the coins enterred, counting a nickel as a quarter and a penny as a nickel occasionally, completely making the account balance incorrect. It is unfortunate that such a marvelously creative toy isn't more properly made. Additionally, I don't like how the money drawer just collects the money in a pile, instead of sorting it slightly. If they improved those two items I think it would be an exceptional product."
1,COLORS MAY VARY......ARE YOU SERIOUS?,"Ok..so I can understand colors may vary - it might be darker or lighter or within the same color family...but pink??? that is a little drastic. I ordered one of these for my son for Christmas. I was aware of the ""color may vary"" disclaimer - but again, I was thinking ""different shade of blue or gray""...but it came pink. If the colors vary that much then they need to give you a choice at check-out. I dont like having to replace a gift I have already decided on and I dont like taking the time to return something. I like shopping from Amazon and the purchases come very quickly but I am disappointed in this experienceSummit Zillions Deluxe ATM - Colors May Vary."
5,Love This ATM!!!,"This is a great toy! My oldest recieved it 2 years ago for Christmas. He was only 5 and loved it! Now he is 7 and his brother is 5 and they both use it. It is great. It really helps them realize that when you save your money it really adds up! My daughter is 2 and everytime she finds a penny or change she sayd ""Uh-Oh! Bank!!"" And goes to find the ATM. We give it as a present all the time! We love it!!"
3,OK,My son likes this because he loves to hoard his money! It was a pain to set up but now he uses it and it does work. Not worth the money in my opinion but he's happy!
2,Hard to use,"The buttons are hard to push and it only registers what you're typing half of the time. The idea is definitely cute. However, my 6 year old can easily follow the steps to make the ATM function, but the buttons are so hard to press that it doesn't work properly most of the time."
4,Good product....,I got this for my 11 year old daughter. She likes how she can deposit and withdraw money. She likes to see the total and helps her to meet her goals. She can type in the amount she would like to save to and keeps track of her progress. We all agree it is a bit too loud.
1,A complete piece of junk... and a very disappointed little girl.,"If I could give it zero stars, I would. The coin slot doesn't accommodate quarters, it doesn't count or keep track of the money that is inserted, and doesn't really do any of the things it claims to do. In addition, the display screen is nearly impossible to read. Were it not for the fact that my daughter asked Santa for this gift, and he was kind enough to bring it to her, I would return it immediately."
4,ATM For All Ages,"I first purchased this product for my 9 year old God son. We enjoyed it so much that I ended up purchasing another one for my God Daughter. After it came, I purchased 3 more for my mother (83 years old), my daughter, and myself.My mother can not get the hang of it (she's not trying) but I am using mine and my daughter is using hers. It beats having money laying around the house and when we need extra money we can always go to the ATM machine. It is fun. Mine doesn't really add and subtract correctly but I can use as a bank and put away and get out money as needed!!!"
3,Stopped working after 15 minutes,"Not as durable as expected. The bank stopped working properly just after 15 minutes of use. I replaced the batteries to see if that would fix the problem, no luck. So I sent it back... hopefully the replacement will be better."
1,Worked for a while,"Gave this to our 6 year old daughter for Christmas. It worked fine for a couple of months, but now won't work at all. We have replaced the batteries, reprogrammed the ATM code, re-input all the coins. What a waste of time and money. It was fun while it worked."
1,Junk,"This toy ATM is mostly junk. It is NOT user friendly, especially not for a child. The date is in a non-standard format (for the US). The bills get stuck when being fed into the machine if there are other bills inside blocking the path. There is an alarm clock function that we can't seem to shut off, which currently goes off in the middle of the night. The whole thing is obnoxiously loud with no volume control. I'll resort to putting tape over the speaker, but if there is any way that I can return it, I will. Overpriced plastic junk."
1,Mine was Junk DOA,"Product did not work when unpackaged. Replaced batteries and tried to reset machine, nothing worked. Keypad did not work. When the card was inserted it would mutter a few words then die off. Unfortunately, the box was destroyed before testing the toy. I would not recommend this product. I feel bad for my son who researched it and was so excited to get it. If there are any known common problems/ fixes I would appreciate it. At least then we could use it as an educational device...."
1,didn't like it.,the bills didn't work. the quality of this machine was of poor standard and the time it take to register cash is very slow
1,Very disappointed,"We purchased this as a gift for our 9 year old son. He's very interested in keeping track of money and we thought this ATM Bank was an awesome idea. We were so disappointed with the quality of this bank. It kept resetting every time a bill got stuck in the feeder- which was about every 5 times. If you knocked it too hard, it reset. If you turned it over, it reset. If the money was too crinkled, it jammed the feeder and the machine reset. And if you put in coins too quickly, the machine lost count. And it didn't accurately keep count of the money inserted. Plus, every 10 bills inserted filled it up and you have to open the bottom and push all the money over to the side in order to make room for more bills. Needles to say, we will be looking for another alternative for an electronic bank now."
3,Don't bother,"This worked really well for all of two weeks. A mason jar would be better. We gave this to our 9 yr. old grandson, with starter monies. It jammed and had to be broken to get the funds out."
3,"Nice concept, but doesn't work as described.","Nice concept. Love the sounds and look BUT it doesn't work as described. Possibly we just received a defective one. Would not keep track of coins inserted, so the count was off."
1,HORRIBLE,"I have been an Amazon customer for YEARS and never felt compelled to write a review before now, but I HAD to make sure I commented on this toy. I bought this toy for a Christmas present this year. First, let me say the idea is great--in theory; however, the execution falls flat.The space for the money to be stored is SO small, and the button to open this door pushes in-- but does not pop back out. So, anytime we pushed the button in, we had to put a key its opening to pop it back out. Also, the bank does not recognize $2 bills. My child had several of these and anytime I tried to feed one in, the bank got stuck (& confused) and had to be reprogrammed! because of these issues, I returned it the same day it was received.My child was disappointed, but agreed that it was lame."
3,sandee005,My granddaughter had a little trouble with the key pad at first but eventually figured it out. Got it almost twenty dollars cheaper on Amazon. Was shipped really quick considering it was the Christmas rush season. Overall I'm pleased with the purchase.
2,Restarts on it's own!,"I was entering $100 in $10's, and when i got to $80 all the dollars got jammed and it turned off! Then I had to put in my name, goal, and money in all over! This has happened several times! When I press the numbers they don't even work! Shop for a new bank!"
4,my daughter loves it,My daughter loves it and it is teaching her to save some money. She keeps all of her cash in it but keeps her coins elsewhere.
1,very cheep and not use,"the way it works is u put the money in and u have to tell the thing how much so u are doing it all but the thing just holds it. i disliked it and dont use it. i would say, DONT BUY IT"
3,delivered was not as promissed!,"i was ver upset with amazon! i asked for this toy to give to my son on the holidays , i payed to be deliver in 2 days and they delivered after the holydays 7 days later...never buy anything again from amazon !!i has to find the toy for my son in the last minute after run in several stores at chistmas eve..very upset...the toy itself is good ."
5,MCSE to be - Must Buy,"This is the only book I read to prepare for the NetEss exam. It is well written and holds your attention. I combined it with the Transcender practice tests and passed the first time out by 100 points. If you're only going to buy one book to study for this test, make it this one."
5,"Clearly Written, Accurate, and Priced Right","Having seen - - and purchased - - many study aids in pursuit of the MCSE certification, I can testify that they are not all created equal. While there are many MCSE prep guides of the 3-inch-thick variety, there are fewer that do the job with clear, concise language, and fewer still that are reasonably priced and easily portable. Kinnaman gets complex ideas across in a minimum of space and points out ""must know"" information. I've passed three MCSE exams so far - - all on the first attempt - - using the ""Accelerated"" series as my primary reference. I give them my highest marks."
5,"""Accelerated"" Series: Concise, Well Written, On Target.","McGraw-Hill's ""Accelerated MCSE"" series is concise and clearly written, with a fair amount of emphasis placed on distinguishing between ""good to know"" and ""you'd best know this"" categories of information. The ""Accelerated"" paperbacks can be had for under $20/ea. They go into somewhat more detail than O'Reilly's well known 'Nutshell' books, but are still a quick read. Highly recommended as the first - - and last - - books to read in preparation for an exam."
5,Review on McVicar,"I wanted to give this cd 4 and a half stars, but I wasnt alloud to, so I gave it 5. Personally I think it's brilliant. Daltrey sounds very powerfull in Free Me. I dont like the song white city lights, but thats probably because it isnt written by Townshend, and its very slow. Its a pity that the album only contains 10 tracks, they better made the movie twice as long, but it's sure worth buying."
2,ugh...what a waste of paper!,"The premise for the book is a good, even great one...but this author's writing is 6th grade, at best."
1,A Not so elegant gathering of stereotypes,"Am I the only reader who thought these women were the most annoying, whining self-centered cariactures (not characters)? I kept waiting for an inciting incident, a conflict that would build plot step by plot step to a climax or turning point. Not so. These are like pages from a writer's sketchbook of ideas rather than a novel with rising and falling action. Radish may be a very good journalist and travel writer--no doubt she can use language well--but in this attempt at fiction, I believe she has failed. Instead of focusing on the eight women, she veers off to incorporate phony news articles and side stories of women who hear about the walkers through the media and suddenly change their lives radically. A novelist's challenge is to create a world where the reader can suspend disbelief or at least care about what happens to the characters. I never got to that place."
2,This gathering goes on too long,"I was disappointed in the ""Elegant Gathering of White Snows"". The premise of eight women sharing a deep and meaningful friendship seemed initially very promising, but the book read more like a Hallmark Hall of Fame movie. The writing is very cliched and choppy. None of the characters seemed especially sympathetic, even though they had suffered loss and loneliness, because they had all spent years wallowing in self-pity and inertia.The idea that the entire country would be enthralled by these women's ""walk"" was pretty far-fetched to me as well. And the author adds nothing to the story by throwing in all the minor characters who are drawn to the walking women. Her time would have been better spent developing the major characters more fully.I lost interest about 3/4 of the way through the book and simply stopped reading."
1,Don't waste your time! Boring and poorly written,"I was hoping for something special--the location was intriguing and all the hype [""remarkable journey"" stuff] regarding its premise snared me... half way through, I decided to check the reviews and found I was not alone. So this one is going to the trash--not worth passing on to anyone."
1,Worst book I have ever read.,"Everything the other ""one star"" reviewers have said is correct except that the idea or concept of the book is good. It is not. The premise is illogical.I'm pretty sure the book didn't have an editor - if it had, he/she would have stopped it from being published rather than try to salvage it. The writing was of the quality of my 7th grade creative writing class - truly awful.I dread finishing this book, but not as much as I dread our book club discussion. I feel bad for the person who picked it. It will be hard to talk about this book in a way that doesn't hurt her feelings as there is absolutely nothing good to say about it.I'm sure the author is a lovely person but she needs to find another way to make a living."
3,Not a totally bad book,"This book reminded me a lot of Angry Housewives, but on a simpler level. The women here were not as fleshed out and it seemed to just jump right into the middle of the story without much history, which came later on. While not a great piece of literature, it was a good enough book and worth reading to further explore the phenomenon of women's friendship and how important it is."
1,"Calculated to be an ""Oprah"" book","Too bad Oprah dumped her book club, because the author went to a lot of trouble to try to write a book that might have been considered had the execution been better. As it is, this is a slow read about a group of women, most of whom come off as a bunch of self-pitying whiners. Even the name seems to emulate another much more successful book, ""Snow Falling on Cedars."""
5,Every woman I know who has read this book loves it.,"I purchased this book after it was recommended by a client. I have since recommended it to my book club and numerous other women who have read and enjoyed it and purchased copies for their friends. To me this book highlights how women can be acquainted for long periods of time but not really know one another until they begin to reveal their untold stories. As relationships are forged among the characters, we become closer to their hearts and notice the threads of their stories that mirror our own.I found the dialogue and descriptions in this book fun. It's an easy read and one that I continue to recommend."
1,The Elegant Gathering of White Snows,"The novel was a book club choice, and that's the only reason I finished reading it. The Elegant Gathering of White Snows possesses no elegance whatsoever and is an embarrassment to women everywhere. It appears that the author thought she was depicting strong women, but the reader is constantly bombarded by immature language and selfishness on a grand scale. I believe that this may be the worst piece of adult fiction that I have ever forced myself to finish reading."
1,The Elegant Gathering of White Snows,"Don't waste your money on this book. I will finish the book because it is our book club choice. The characters are shallow and self centered. The writing is middle school quality. Kris Radish seems to have an agenda she is pushing and she was going to get it all into this book come hell or high water. No poetry and no beauty, I could care less about the women in this book. Who could possibly think life's problems could be solved by walking away from them while drinking lots of wine? I treasure my sisters and women friends but I wouldn't want to be a friend to any of these women. I would give it no stars if I could."
1,only for those into melodrama,"This is not a badly written book, but it is definitely over the top in terms of melodrama. It has that ""written for the book club"" feel, and includes just about every terrible and tragic thing that could possibly happen to a woman--yes, there's the abused wife, the rape victim, the wife with the cheating husband, the [...], the tough broad, the depressive etc. etc. Even the supposedly happy characters are so stock--the woman with the incredibly understanding husband, the woman with the blissfully happy marriage. If that's your kind of book, more power to you--you will enjoy it--if it's not, definitely avoid this one at all costs. I cringed through most of it."
1,ZERO STARS,"I'm 3/4 of the way through this book which I picked up at a Library fundraiser for $2. It was overpriced. I know that I will muddle my way through this, get to the end and think to myself ""why did I bother""? The other reviewers are correct, this is TERRIBLY written."
2,an elegant gathering of white snows,"I didn't enjoy reading this book at all. The characters didn't seem real. The issues didn't come home for me. Most of all... this book seemed to be about healing. There was FAR too much focus on drinking wine and beer for anyone to be doing any real healing or soul searching. I was very disapppointed. The ""idea"" of the book was the only positive aspect."
1,So bad I had to say something,"This is the worst book I have read in recent history. The author needs to take some classes on how to write a readable book; the characters are so poorly presented I felt like I was grading a middle school writing assignment. I would give this effort an ""F"". If this is supposed to be empowering to women, I am ashamed to be one. Never have I read a book that made me roll my eyes with each new page of the whining, hollow and self centered characters that I was presented with. If you want empowerment, look elsewhere!"
1,The Elegant Gathering of White Snows,"If you are a lesbian, a manhater, or a voyeur of women's unsolved problems, you may like this book. If not, look elsewhere for a good read.The author insults readers' intelligence with an undeveloped plot, amateurish writing, and redundancy that would make a high school English teacher cringe.So why did I continue reading? I did find the book to have one redeeming value-- it was an excellent remedy for insommnia."
1,"Sorry, Ms. Radish . . . Sorry I paid for this book!","Please save your money and do not purchase this book. It is one of the most poorly written books I have ever read--if I were able to finish the whole thing. I usually end up launching the book across the room when I run into another one of the sappy, superficial, poorly constructed ""tales of woe."" The characters are incomplete, the plot, while interesting enough to draw someone to the book, is about as well constructed as a two year old's house of blocks. I am unwilling to list all the flaws I found--I fear carpal tunnel syndrome. This is a very harsh review and I feel bad for the author, but I feel worse for the editor who let her think this was an example of ""good"" writing. I guess they will publish anything. I hope the author made enough money with this book to compensate her for these public criticisms as I would hate to be in her shoes."
3,Friendship at its finest,"While I enjoyed this story about the women and their close relationship to one another, I found that the circumstances were not always credible. I do not think that such an event would have sparked such a media frenzy.Despite this, I liked the differing stories told by the women and their bond with each other would make any woman envious. Such friendship and loyalty is refreshing to read about."
4,A Great Read!,"I wandered into a book store searching for something to read prior to taking an international flight. I had in mind several novels but this particular book store had small placards suggesting books that should be read, such as, 'our staff recommends..."" I picked up, Elegant Gathering, read the back cover, thought interesting but put the book back on the shelf. As I wandered through the book store, the title and the front cover lingered in my mind. I went back to the book and thought let me read the first page -- and from there I was hooked. I think this is one of the best books, I've read on women and relationships with other women; be that a mother, a grandmother, a daughter or a partner. Flying back home, I read quickly and cried frequently. I'd highly recommend this reflective novel illustrating the passages of life to all of my (female) friends."
1,Unbelievable!!!,"From the very beginning of this book I was bored. This is yet another story of ""downtrodden"" women. The trek across Wisconsin didn't seem real to me. These women did not seem real to me. Mary was the only one with any sense!!!"
1,"Interesting Idea, Terrible Writing","I picked this book up for a book club, and we had selected it based on the fact that it was set in our state. Not one of us enjoyed it and half the group couldn't even finish it.The idea for the novel is intriguing, but the author executed it horribly. The characters are flat and difficult to distinguish from one another, and errors in the writing were inexcusable. At one point she wrote something like, ""she lived alone with four other women."" How exactly does that work? Didn't she have an editor? Without better characterization you couldn't appreciate the women's' quest and the prose was so bad it was like listening to fingernails down a chalk board.Pass this one up--it's not worth the time or money."
1,It didn't deliver,"This book had promise, but the author did not deliver. I couldn't find sympathy for or even like the characters. The story dragged. But the most off-putting aspect was the writing. Rather than letting the characters convey the story, emotions, etc. Kris Radish TOLD the reader what to think. And the lesbian angle to the book didn't endear me to the book either. I don't recommend this book. And I agree with the other reviewer who commented that this book was tailored to be an Oprah Book club selection."
1,Nothing elegant about this,"The description on the back cover sounded so good that I couldn't wait to read it. I was turned off right away by a bunch of woman complaining about how badly life and particularly men had treated them. The rest of the book was more of the same - lots of ""poor me"" and wallowing in self pity. I did not find any of the characters likeable or endearing even though we were constanly told how wonderful and special they were.I didn't find the writing particularly good and I thought it ridiculous that the whole world would be moved by a bunch of woman abandoning their lives to walk. This is definitely a book to miss."
1,VERY confusing,There is way too much going on in this book and it skips around so much with different characters that it makes it hard to follow I would NOT recommend this book to anyone.
5,The most thoughtful book about birding and birders ever writ,"This is a wonderful, thoughtful book about the meaning of birding: how it changes us and our relationships with others. Levine is a sophisticated thinker and a clear writer, and discovers facets to our hobby that most of us never dreamed existed. Buy it, read it."
3,Touch the Masters hand,"I have always loved this poem since playing violin in High School. the poem is great, but the illustrations were somewhat disappointing."
4,Nice vacuum.,"We upgraded to a Dyson Pink recently. We love how easy it is to remove and dump the canister and the amount of dust it picks up. We live in the desert where dust is a common invader and covers everything in the house. This vacuum gets up more dust than any other we have owned. The filters are also easy to remove and clean. The design is attractive too. I gave this vacuum 4 stars instead of 5 because the wand is a bit cumbersome when trying to vacuum in tight areas. Perhaps a different design for the wand would make it a bit easier to use. Also, the vacuum doesn't come with a practical attachment to get underneath beds. All in all, it's a good little vacuum for regular household cleaning."
3,WHAT A WONDERFUL VOICE AND A GREAT DELIVERY...............,"I first discovered Shirley when she sang on the Goldfinger Soundtrack. Little did i know that she would become a huge international star. I have several of her cds and this is one of the better ones. Her voice is powerful and her material is great. The only concern i have about this cd, is that some of the selections were recorded live. For the most part here arrangements were great with a few exceptions. I think anyone who bought this cd would more than be pleased."
5,"Great read, opens ones eyes to how the French and Indian War heated up.",Great insight into the French and Indian war from the vantage point of Robert Stobo. This is a fun read and you will learn a few things about George Washington and his first military engagement. This is not what you learned in school. Highly recommended....
4,a must read for a beginner,"I wanted to learn MVS assembler , and this book helped me to achieve it , use it as the first book , the one's who introduce you slowly but surely to the MVS assembler world , then if you want to discover system programming stuffs search for the book written by Carmine Cannatello (Advanced ..), unfortunately those books are rare these days.The authors guide you step by step - and for me , who is used with C programming and address/pointers handling , it was very to understand."
4,Assember on a mainframe,Good intoduction for beginners to mainframe assembler. Gives a brief overview of the mainframe for people who have not been exposed to MVS.
2,Don't Pay Full Price,"Better yet, don't pay for it at all. Get it free if you can (like borrowing it from the library). To highlight the problems other readers have mentioned:1. ""The Drawings are Not too Good"". Unevenly portioned faces and bodies. Seems more amateur than professional.2. ""COPIC. BUY COPIC. COPIC is best."" Argh.3. A combination of 1 and 2 distracts from what the book is trying to teach.If airbrushing is totally new to you, then this certainly won't hurt, but it won't help much either."
4,Concept album,"Certain tracks on this album are marvellous, and others, particularly on side two, get long and ponderous. It works on ""The Wild Wild Sea"" but not on ""When the Angels Fall,"" a miserable exercise in the rhyming dictionary. Overall this is a very sad album, with happy moments, as Sting wrestles with his father's death and growing old."
4,Quick arrival,"The CD case had more wear than I expected. But, the CD itself was is in good condition."
5,Solid night sights,"I bought these for my Smith and Wesson 686 Plus revolver. The rear sight is much more robust than the factory rear sight blade, which is pretty thin. The sights are really bright in a dark room and easy to pick up with your eyes. For night sights you can't beat this price and they only add to the functionality of your firearm. I can't speak to ease of installation because I had a gun smith do it. I have not previously owned any firearms with Meprolight night sights, but I know several other people who have used Meprolight. Until now, all my night sights have been Trijicon or Glock night sights, but I find these Meprolight sights to be as good as any other I've used. I'd always recommend night sights on your firearms and these can't be beat for price and quality."
5,Excellent value for the money,"Thats the way bands should treat their fans. 2 dvds, 1 cd.PCM, DD5.1, DTS Sound formats. The only thing missing is the 16:9 video format. But the image and Film are great nevertheless. The camera work and lighting are excellent too.If you are a lost fan of The Mission and you are wondering what have been of them. Just buy this DVD. You will be surprise.If you have never listen to them, give it a try. This is a lot better than the garbage you hear on the radio nowdays."
1,Do not waste your money,"A waste of money , only a few words and all are the most common and in use if a child signs at all."
5,"Beautiful and simplistic, a great starter book","I have a toddler with speech disorder and use signs to agument communication. the easy to understand diagrams and simple description of how to make the sign was extremely useful to me. My son enjoyed the wonderful illustrations. I am using this book and its companion ""More Simple Signs"" to aid his teacher and classmates. Cindy Wheeler should be commended on her beautiful books. Only a parent of a ""special"" child understands how issues should be presented. These books are extremely useful"
1,Clasp very poorly made,"Bracelet is very pretty and does sparkle nicely, however the clasp barely holds at all. It holds so poorly that it fell off my girlfriend's wrist the first night she had it and was lost. If you do purchase this item, reclasp it before wearing it."
4,Sparkly Bling!,This sparkles and catches the light so beautifully! I know a previous reviewer said there was a problem with the clasp but I am thinking it's been improved since that was written as I had no problem. The bracelet has a double safety clasp (clip on either side) which means both would have to fail PLUS the release button would have to fail in order for the bracelet to fall off. I'm really happy I had this on my wish list and my hubbie spotted it!
2,No Subtitles,"I like foreign films and have no problem with this gender but by rule there's always subtitles for movies sold in the US... so to my disapointment after I bought this movie and try to watch it there are no subtitles of any kind or alterenate audio and its not stated in the description, yes it says is in German but we expect subtitles...I watch this movie as a child dubbed to spanish so I remember this movie so when browsing I came across the movie I instantly bought it only to be let down cause i can not understand a thing. So unless you speak German is a non win situation."
3,great movie from my childhood!,....but in German with no English subtitles! What a shame! I search and search for English-language but unsuccessful - disappointed but left it as part of my DVD library
4,In time and as advertised,"The movie was a gift that I bought in behalf of a friend. What I can tell you is that it arrives in time, in perfect conditions. I think the movie was OK, but I don't know and also is not the kind of movies I like."
3,Light Zeppelin,"Led Zeppelin: A Classical TributeThis instrumental album brings home how heavy Led Zep were. The string quartet arrangements are quite enjoyable on original lighter tracks like That's the Way, but don't quite cut it on the likes of Dazed and Confused, and Kashmir."
3,"It's ok, but not a satisfying Moroccan Mint tea","The good: it's organic and reasonably priced.The less good: pretty weak flavor, even after steeping for awhile. If you're looking for a traditional Moroccan Mint mix, this isn't it. It contains lemon grass, which is a nice flavor but not in Moroccan Mint tea. If you want a very mild, mostly herbal tea, you might like this."
3,Good but dated,"This book provided a comprehensive primer on how to deal with all the issues surrounding an addition or renovation. While it offered lots of cost estimating advice and other tips, many of them were dated and not in line with the current economy. Not that I expected anything different! One thing the book didn't really cover well was the current trend toward builder/architect firms that marry both these specialities into one vendor. But all in all, a worthwhile investment for anyone considering building an addition or starting a renovation project (or both)."
5,The best Bible for the hurting,I picked up this Bible for the new translation since my other Bible was the older Living Bible. I was amazed at how helpful this Bible was. I was in a very hurting situation and went to the back picked the emotion I was feeling and read the scripture associated with the emotion. Now it's the main source I use first for help. I was so impressed I bought the smaller Touchpoint pocket book.The only draw back of this book is that the paper cover curls. I bought a cover like the one's they put on library paperbacks and it solved my problem. It's a more durable book now. And I can wipe off the cover if it gets wet or dirty.Awesome Book! A great help when you are broken and hurting.
5,This book is powerful and annointed!,"This bible ""touches"" my life and the lives of those around me. Everywhere I take it people want to pick it up and read it: even un-believers. It's wonderful layout and easy language helps to make this the most user-friendly study bibles around. I take it everywhere I go - i'ts almost like a security blanket. I would recommend this bible to all brothers and sisters in Christ who need a deeper understanding and to those who are still soul searching for God and a relationship with him."
5,Touch Point Bible,"I have a few other Bibles,but this one is very easy to find what you are looking for. My other Bible are NIV and The Book, they to are good books but touch point is much easier to read and understand. I am new to reading the Bible so this book is a great help to me."
4,Touch Point NLT Bible,NIV and NLT are much the same! I prefer NLT on the advice of a long time preacher in California! The book is easy to carry(size) and the print isn't too small. All in all....very good!
5,This is a great bible,"This paperback bible is amazing. It has wonderful footnotes on many of the pages that help explain the scriptures in more detail. It's a wonderful bible, especially for someone that is just getting started in the Christian faith and purchasing their first bible. However, this is also great for the experienced Christian because it helps us gain greater understanding of the passages we've read."
5,Touch Point Bible,"This Bible is so very understandable. Bcuz those. ""Thee, thou, & art thee words are eliminated & it is written in completely the same version as King James, but the difficult words in the OTHER Bibles I've studied, were difficult to comprehend. THIS TOUCH POINT BIBLE IS A MUST READ. I <3 this book.It is truly ""The Best Book I've ever read, & will continue to read EVERYDAY. (8"
2,Touchpoint Bible,"This Bible is a great references book, however I did not receive all pages that was listed in the table of contents. The chapter that is missinG is ""160 All Time Favorite Bible Passages"" (1301) frist book was returnand repleacement order was the same as the frist. You need to inspect your stock before shipping a repleacement order.ThanksMelvin Truiett, Sr."
5,Love it!!,I love this Bible and have bought it several times as gifts. It is easy to read and has the extra touchpoints that make it even easier to understand.At the beginning of each chapter there is information on who wrote it and other historical information.Highley recommended!
2,Bible,Not in good shape as listed. Inside page was written on all over. Dedicated to someone. Had purchased as a gift for my mom.
5,Love Touchpoint Bible,My daughter loves this Bible. it was recommended by our youth pastor and it was a great suggestion for our teenager.
4,Straightforward Interpretations of Classic Christmas Music,"I have a recording of this album produced for the South Korean market, and the quality is very good.According to allmusic.com, this album was orginally released in 1959. This is a good recording of traditional Christmas and holiday music, interpreted by Pat Boone in a very straightforward manner. Thus, the record is a very good listen. What struck me as interesting is that, in several numbers, Pat Boone sounds somewhat similar to Bing Crosby; their vocal ranges were similar and, for songs without either's trademark vocal embellishments, the interepretations and sounds were similar."
2,I couldn't get into this book,"I was never able to feel connected to any of the characters in this book and felt like I couldn't wait for it to end so I could get on to my next read. Sorry, I really wanted to like this series but I didn't"
5,This book is excellent!,"This is a well constructed book. You really feel for the main charchter and her family. You can feel the force that drives her to make something of her husband and her family. She suffers a lot especially from unrequited love. This book is excellent and the historical detail and accuracy is amazing. This book, the first in the dynasty, was a great starting book. It made me want to go out and read all the others which were just as good."
4,One of the most unique battletech books,"I really enjoyed this book. It was much different from other battletech novels in that it involves a lost jump ship crew and the passengers suffer a misjump and arrive at a world populated by an alien species as well as a group of humans decended from another group who misjumped there several centuries before. Fortunately, the newly arrived humans are led by a DEST commando. The action usually seen in other battletech books is not here, but I was still intrigued by the subtle power plays in the novel. Definately a great book."
2,This could be left out ..,"Far Country could easily have been left out of the BattleTech series, or even renamed. While, as some reviewers have stated, it has relatively decent character development, and has an intriguing premise, it adds very little if anything to the Inner Sphere/Clan Worlds story.As a stand alone it isn't bad, and it does step back and cover a more basic level of human experience in the BattleTech universe. Still, I saw very little that requires this book to be read. Maybe it is in some way or fashion connected to the future of the Successor States, but if so, I haven't read the connection yet.It does include a LAM, but for the most part, I did not see a lot of the things I most wanted to see."
5,One of my favorite duckies,"I admit, I collect rubber duckies. They are my biggest guilty pleasure. However I don't collect just any rubber ducky. I try to find duckies that are different from your average yellow rubber bathtub toy. Accoutrement makes my favorite line of duckies...the devil duckie. One of my favorite devil duckies is the ninja devil duckie. The duckie itself is a little more stiff than the other devil duckies. To be perfectly honest, a real ninja wouldn't have a ninja star painted on its chest like the ninja duckie has, nor wear a red mask as far as I know but I'm just being picky. Ninja duckie is cool in my book."
3,Cute but overpriced shipping,"This is a very cute little duckie, but if I could have found it ANYWHERE else, I would have bought it in person because the shipping was not a good deal."
5,Tattoo duck,"My husband collects rubber ducks so I was pretty excited to see this one. Delivery was prompt, product was in brand new shape. Would order from this provider again."
5,Pretty cool.,The woman loves to collect these so I surprise her from time to time. The seller actually included a second duck for free. Pleasant surprise. I will be buying from them again.
1,crazy,How can you allow children to play with nonsense - its ridiculous! Nasty idea! I would never buy it for my child since I am concerned with its morale.
2,An inferior sequel,"Like all sequels, this follow-up to James' similar 1976 project for Sheffield Labs, called The King James Version, doesn't really measure up to the original. Both were audiophile recordings of the James orchestra made in a chapel in Los Angeles using a single microphone, and both have great sound. But, while the 1976 set caught the band at the right time and doing a strong set of standards, this 1979 set suffers from some personnel changes that have left the ensembles a little less impressive and some really egregious pop covers. A big band version of the ""Sanford and Son"" theme might have been fun, but the arrangement is distressingly bland, and there's just no excuse for James to be doing Kris Kristofferson tunes. Still Harry After All These Years is not an unpleasant record, but it's an utterly inessential one."
3,Matman SInglet substituted,SportsRcool contacted us because they sold out of this singlet. They were very kind and substituted a Matman Singlet in its place. Very happy with customer service.
4,"A wonderful ""primer""","This is an incredible (but unfortunately costly) way to introduce students to the method of philosophizing in the analytic tradition. I use it as the first book and a recurring theme in all of my introductory philosophy courses and students tell me it is accessible and worthwhile. I only wish I would have found it when I was an undergrad instead of having to ""feel"" my way through discovering philosophical method.The section ""Living up to your Intellectual Standards"" is particularly good and helps students understand that philosophy is a practical skill as well as what they come into the class thinking it is.My only complaint is that the section on fallacies could be much, much better. I spend nights wishing Kiernan-Lewis would just rewrite that section to catch up to the much better books in that area (e.g. Anthony Weston's ""A Rulebook for Arguments""). Even without this revision though, this is a wonderful book to teach which can change people's lives."
3,22 Bucks???!!!,"Now this is a pretty good book, but not worth anything more than fifteen dollars. The thing's only a hundred or so pages in length. DKL explains the principles of establishing and analyzing your belief system in fluid detail. Seeing things through objective, subjective realities and such. And it could always be used as a cure for insomnia.Adios."
3,Too expensive for such a short tape!,"I was very disappointed at the short viewing time, not to mention the preview for other videos located at the beginning of the tape. Also, there were episodes missing inbetween! This was a continued series, and didn't make much sense out of order and missing episodes!"
2,Wasn't as happy with this one.,"I really hated this era of remixed singles. It seems that everyone put the same house/dance track behind a perfectly good song and called it a remix.I hated all of the remixes of Getting Closer, and Fun to be Had.The only saving grace for this single is the song, Out of Mind (NOT Out of My Mind). It's always cool to hear a bonus song, which in my mind was an incentive to get the single. There was another track called Taken from Me that appeared on the limited edition 12"" single, but was not included on the cd single.This was pretty much the beginning of the end for Nitzer Ebb."
5,YAY! Finally!,YAY!!! I can't tell you how HAPPY I am that they are finally releasing this!! I sincerely hope they can release all the other seasons as well !! THANK YOU!
5,Love it!,"I basically grew up watching this show (I am 27 now). I was so excited when I heard that they were FINALLY coming out with season 4! I definitely recommend this show to adolescents, teenagers, and even young adults who have not had the opportunity to see this show. I promise that it is definitely worth watching :)"
3,The best season yet (finally...) but it's only the original episodes.,"Yes, it's season 4, which we've all been waiting for for YEARS and yes, the episodes are as good as you remember.Unfortunately, that's all there is in the box (which doesn't match the original releases' outer paper slip covers). There's no special features or commentary. NOTHING. Nothing but ""Play All"" and ""Episode Selection."" It's as if this was what they were working on right after Season 3 came out, then they shut down the project, green lit the release of Season 4, and didn't try to add anything. Even the main menu is painfully bland- WORSE than what the main menu was for Seasons 1 - 3.Buy this for the episodes only (THEY'RE GREAT!), but be aware that that's all you'll get We were spoiled with the first batch... Sadness. >:("
5,Prayer has been answered!,"THANK YOU Lions Gate! Thank you for answering the prayers of BMW fans around the world!I was so crushed and devastated to find out they weren't releasing season 4 few years back (I think it was 2006?) and now I'm overjoyed to know after almost 4 years of wait, the 4th season will be released at last! Please don't cancel out of a sudden, or stop releasing more seasons.. I hope this will be released until the final season because BMW rocks.. and you can't get good classic tv shows like this anymore nowadays. Let us enjoy good tv shows we grew up with."
5,The only glossy paper to use with a Canon printer,"I use this paper with my Canon i6600D and the results are fantastic. It's heavy and thick enough to be durable and after the ink dries a bit the finish is actually pretty smooth. I've not found a paper (Canon, anyhow) that matches the lab stuff as far as that ""waxed glass"" feel to the finished product but this stuff is pretty damn close. I have also used the Canon Photo Paper Plusy Glossy and although I don't notice printing quality differences, the Pro is definitely superior if you're going to be handling the pictures with your hands. For framing or other presentation where you'll never handle the paper, the Plus is fine, but go with the Pro for showing them off to others or giving them as gifts."
1,Deceptive /misleading web display,"This item is not what is displayed on the web site. Note, there is a picture of a bridge, however, when I received the package, the picture was that of a female smelling a bunch of roses.The numbers are identical on both packages, though the one showing a bridge is the older packaging - the product in the older package was for my purposes better than the newer package. The reason was the Canon watermark on the older paper is lighter than that on the newer paper. This was very important for me as I print on both sides of the paper, as I use the paper in creating Greeting Cards for vaious holidays. I like the Glossy side for displaying a photograph and the reverse side for printing text."
4,Latest pack of Photo Pro is different,"I've been using 8.5x11 size Photo Paper Pro for a few years. All was good.I just bought two of the 30-sheet packs and noticed something different.I often print 4 photos/page and separate them with a straight edge & razor blade. On this batch of paper the ink often chips off the edge near my cut - resulting in a messy edge. (I can usually get around it by making another sliver-thin cut, removing a little from my print.) Previous purchased paper does not do this.It isn't a big deal I admit - if it's only this. I hope Canon hasn't made any significant changes in the long-term integrity of their best paper."
1,Bad company,Terrible company to do business with. They send the wrong order and then refuse to return phone calls. Impossible to get a live voice. E-mails are ignored.They provide no return address in the package or on the package and their website instructs to call for a return address. Beware when ordering from this company.
2,Stick with RTP,"When this came out back in 84, it was great because it was the only live Styx available. This album has not aged well. Good thing Styx recorded another live CD, one that is more inspired. If you want live Styx, stick with ""Return To Paradise"". The band is tighter, better and the song selection (while basically the same as Caught In The Act) contains older hit and 3 new songs. Take note that Caught In The Act is the only chance you'll have to hear John Panozzo live, so this is a must have for a Styx fan, although not as inspired as RTP."
4,Good Styx music,"I have been a fan of Styx for a long time. I wasn't sure what I was in for when I bought this CD. I must say, I was pleasantly surprised. Dennis and the gang's vocals sound great. They seem to have more energy live then they do on their studio albums. My only quibble is that they didn't include a lot of their hits, such as Renegade or the Grand Illusion."
2,Styx Live can be so much better.,"When I first heard that Styx was coming out with a live album, I was ecstatic. I had been to see Styx live every time they came to town because it was always a fantastic show and the sound was as good as that achieved in the studio. What a disappointment this album is.Styx's harmonies are not as sharp as they can be and their music is not as tight. Every song ends the same (with the exception of Fooling Yourself and Crystal Ball, which show some imagination).The band either got too confident in their abilities and stopped trying or chose the wrong show to record live. I recommend this album only for those who want to complete a collection or who like the live sound."
3,The last gasp for the most popular Styx lineup!,"The 1984 release Styx Caught in the Act,captures the most popular Styx lineup at the end of their career.The album was recorded on the supporting tour for Kilroy was Here in 1983,which was a disasterous tour.Anyway after Styx broke up A&M released Caught in the Act which contains 14 of Styx's classic songs,leaving out a few big hits like Renegade,The Grand Illusion,and Lady,but most of the other big hits are present like Too Much Time on My Hands,Babe,Snowblind,Blue Collar Man,Come Sail Away,and some of the stronger albums cuts.Caught in the Act is a good album,but consider some of the songs that are missing it's an incomplete representation of Styx in concert.Worth owning,just the songs are a mixed bag."
2,Styx gets the job done...but that's it!,"I am a big fan of Styx, but I have to say that on this live album they simply don't sound any good. No inspiration and no atmosphere. The musicians sounds like they are bored on stage. If I didn't know better I would swear that Dennis is waiting for a call from the hospital where his wife is due to give birth. It sounds as if he just wants to get outta this place (BOC). The only glimpse of a great band comes forward in their performance of ""Crystal ball"". Never the less. The ""Caught in the act"" album is better than their recent ""Return to paradise"". I think that says it all."
2,A disappointing read........,"I was quite disappointed in this point as I though it was going to go more in depth as to ""why and how"" companies are marketing to the masses AND classes. Instead, what I got was a lot of repetition about how each luxury buying group the writer has created chooses to spend their money. This is stated very early on in the book and repeated without any new data several times thoughout, which gets tiresome quickly. There are charts and graphs to back up this same data but even they are repeated multiple times. Skip this one if you are looking for more substance."
4,The truth about luxury,Undiscovered information about the luxury fashion business. Realistic views with psychological analysis of consumer behaviour.
5,Best available,"Best available. Perfect for wide neck resonators. Pretty good for many acoustics. For electrics the string spacing is a little wide but the thick cast constructuction allows room to file the top down and reduce to fit the nut-width. Any local shop with the ability to cut a new nut should also be able to if you can't, or don't want to. Usable on an electric as is but the added width would take some adjustment period. I bought three (using 1 as is, and 2 for modification).The other options I've seen are basically a bent piece of metal (about 1/6 the thickness) that is so thin that no modification or custom fitting is possible. Haven't yet recorded using them yet for a comprehensive comparison, but the metal construction seems to add a lively sustain. My only criticism is I wish they also offered non grooved blanks which would save me filing them down, but then again this version works for more people's needs."
4,A story built on repeating past episodes,"A Minotaur is a fabled half bull and half human who in ancient mythology was imprisoned in a labyrinth. The creature feeds on human flesh. In the myth it was killed by the warrior Theseus. The filmmakers of this series draw their material from such myths as well as the Bible and other sources. In this case Hercules meets the Minotaur again and subdues it. He becomes involved when two young men accidently open the cage where the beast is imprisoned. This film retells previous episodes such as Hercules' battle with a giant, recalling the biblical battle of David and Goliath, he being swallowed by a serpent, drawing on the scriptural tale of Jonah and the wale, and the time he saved people who were deprived of fire, reflecting the myth of Prometheus who brought fire to humanity."
3,"Great information, but written less than great","This author did her research and put together a great compilation of stories and contributions of several amazing scientists. However, it's not very cosy reading, as the writing is pretty choppy. The flow from paragraph to paragraph is not very smooth, and McGrayne's line of thought jumps around, sometimes even contradicting her own points. I am pleased with the work she put into her research, including many personal interviews, and the information available, but I am a little disappointed in the haphazard assembly of these important stories and the less than inspirational writing style."
5,publisher should do an update to include new women Nobel winners,"I am currently reading the first edition of this book (from the library) copyright 1996. There have been 4 more women Nobel laureates since the 2001 edition (none between 1996-2001 sadly).If the publisher does do an update I would encourage them to include color photographs of more recent winners as well as pictures of them as girls.I am creating a ""women Nobel scientists"" display for grade school girls and a visual picture of these women makes them ""real"" people, just as this well-written book does.Girls need role models for careers in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM).Secondly, as long as I'm telling the publisher what to do--each woman should be pictured with elements of science so that without reading anything you know these women are scientists. Many of these pictures exist on the internet, get permission to use them."
4,Great product!,I have to say I really love this ointment. I have used it on my dog for mange and on my cat for infected scratches/wounds and it does a great job of completely healing them in a short amount of time. The smell is a deterrent to keep them from licking the product off so it stays on and gets the job done. I would say not to get it on any bedding or furniture that you can't easily wash. I will definitely keep this ointment around the house for one of my pet emergency first aid kit staples.
2,Doesn't work,"I purchased Nu-Stock for my Collie who has Demodectic mange. The reviews and the information on the bottle says it should work. Even guarantees it! Guess I should've asked for my money back. I can see how it would work for Sarcoptic mange, but it only makes Demodex worse."
5,Great stuff that really works!!!,"My dog was was scratching his ear very vigorously. Brought him to the vet, who couldn't get a good skin specimen to absolutely confirm that it was mange, but she was almost 100% sure, so we treated him for mange. She gave him ivermectim orally for 4 doses a week apart, but additionally I did some reading online and discovered this wonderful product. Did as the instructions indicated to put on affected area after cleaning it to remove any dirt, etc. Well, after one treatment, he stopped itching and the sores on his inner ear started to heal nicely. I continued the same treatment every 3 days, and after three treatments, it was gone. His hair hasn't grown back yet, but that will come. One suggestions: when you cut the tube applicator, make sure you cut it down to the screw thread because this lotion is very thick. In fact, I had to insert a long thin rod into the tube to get it flowing. Make sure to shake the tube prior to each use.Buy this, it works!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Can't Get Rid of the Smell!,"We purchased this locally as the container claimed it killed mites instantly and was a safe non-toxic cure for all pets & animals. Contents listed were 70% Sulfur and pine oil along with mineral oil. It smelled like Pine Sol when we opened it. That is till we rubbed down some stray pups with it. The sulfur smell is horrible, and is the only thing we can smell for half a mile. And we have seen no improvement in the pups after 5 days even after following treatment recommendations.Update:It took 10 days of treatment for any signs of improvement. During that time this product was transfered to my clothes somehow. The sulfur will stay in your washer and dryer and contaminate everything you wash for weeks or even months. Do not launder any contaminated clothing. It will not come out. Might as well burn the clothing article."
3,nu-stock,It spreads on like a paste. It is yellow and kind of stinking. So you really have to be carefull putting this onO. How and when. Other than that I guess it works okay.
1,Maed my foster sick,I use the product twice and after the second time my young foster pup developed a horrific cough. My holistic Vet said that sulfur can cause lung issues and my poor pup is suffering. Will never use this product again. Not worth the risk. Building the immune system for mange is the best remedy and safest too!
5,works.,"I was skeptical at first but this stuff works and it smells awesome. The clean smell of the pine oil and the bacteria killing sulfur actually smells good to me. and it works fast. not sure if it cleaned up my dog's Demodex, i will be finding out tomorrow after a vet scraping. The vet also prescribed advantage multi, so with multi my dog has been growing its hair back(localized infection)."
4,iPAQ 2215 carrying case by Insipio/Krusell,"I am glad I ordered this product, especially for the price (about $20 w/ shipping). I like it particularly because there are little pockets for my extra SD cards, and there is a swivel for belt clip for pretty easy access.A few things I'd like to see changed/enhanced:1. replace the flap snap w/ velcro2. make the case itself a little tighter around the iPAQ3. include some kind of ""accordian"" style pocket for optionally carrying a set of small headphones"
5,Very Nice Oil,"This is the best oil I have used so far. I have even used this on some older instruments as well. It doesn't evaporate as fast as the other oils. It is also plenty fast for valves.One thing is that if you mix this oil with other oils, it will gum up after a while."
1,Not age appropriate,"Too bad that an imaginative author like Marissa Moss has no moral compass. Any mention of occult matters in a book for 2nd-5th graders in WAYYY out of bounds--you can't even lean on the multi-cultural argument. Tarot cards, Ouji boards and reading chicken bones are something (superstitions) our kids shouldn't even be exposed to (and something that was highly unusual in kid's literature just 20 years ago). And the same is true whether your family is Christian, Jewish or Muslim--mentioning the occult and making it part of the plot is just offensive. Because it is a bright, attractive book it IS hard for kids to discern just how wrong it is.My own 8 yo daughter read 2 other Amelia books w/o incident, then got to this one. There won't be anything by Marissa Moss in our household again. There's too much GOOD literature out there to waste time on trash."
5,My Favorite Amelia Book!,"All of the Amelia stories are wonderful, but this one is absolutely my favorite! I loved reading this book as a kid (previously titled ""Amelia Hits the Road""), especially during my childhood family vacations. Amelia makes everything more fun!"
1,Not what I expected,"A very easy read, a little too easy. Was hoping for more in depth insight. Much of the content is common sense."
5,Great book.,Excellent book. Authors give a different and very interesting approach and great concepts. Has been quite useful and I highly recommend it.[...]
5,Won't Sit on the Shelf Collecting Dust!,"Just like ""Wheel of Fortune's"" before and after, Make Your Point is filled with ""common sense of humor."" But there is nothing common about it. A quick, easy read, these real tales about real people help clarify the Diamond technique introduced in the book. I always considered myself a good communicator, I know I am now a better one for having read the book. I loved the book the first time I read it, and the next 6 times I referenced it for help. In fact, I'm putting it on my gift list to give to my clients."
2,Not well engineered,More difficult to install and parts did not fit together correctly which left gaps and made it look cheap. It also wobbled and was difficult to balance. This fan was for my bedroom but is now in my office instead.
3,Lovely Gathas,"I'm enjoying the gathas that celebrate the tiny efforts and experiences of everyday life. Though small gestures, they may hold the key to mindfulness and liberation, and also to enjoying your life a little more."
4,quite moving,"well written story of an illinoisan who courageously stood up to evil in nanking, captures the era and her anguish. Tragically, three generations later, a historian also from illinois -- iris chang -- would become another victim of the unbearability of evil, when she covered the same japanese war crimes."
4,A wonderful memoir and study of sibling loss,"Part memoir and part sociological study, [The Empty Room] uses personal remembrance and interviews to study the grief felt by siblings who have lost a brother or sister. The author was the sister of one of the ""bubble boys,"" and the fame of his case was often overwhelming for her and her family after he died. She charts her own attempts to grieve her brother and to understand the grief of her parents. At the same time, she interweaves the recollections of other siblings who have lost one or more brothers or sisters (including an interesting chapter on twins). The book is interesting for someone in the process of grieving, but is equally interesting on its own."
5,The Epitome of Christmas,"This Portmeirion series for Christmas is the best. They seem so delicate, but just as promised they went through the dishwasher safe and sound with no loss of shine or color. I've used them for several years now and they still look new."
3,Not Bad,"I bought this receiver in 2002, and for that time it was fine for the price, I think around $400. However, I recently bought a Yamaha RX-v661 for $500, and I can't believe how superior this unit is to the Sony. The setup, the remote, features like pure direct and the ipod dock, and especially the sound make me think the sony was overpriced and not as good as the Yamaha."
1,Monkey Madness!!!,"On a trip to the United States I passed through the lovely town of Portland, Oregon and found this atrocity in a massive used book store. The cover looked funny and entertaining, but all these thoughts were quelled the moment I began to read the book. Nonetheless its sheer stupidity kept me turning the pages.Upon reading this book, I was struck by the ignorance of this author. Not only does this short novel lack any coherent structure, but also is a sour attempt at humor. I can understand that Bush's face looks like a chimp's, but joking about how he has been switched at birth for a ""hairless chimpanzee"" is unimaginative and banal. My question is, ""who cares?"" If you want to chastise a political leader, why not do so intelligently, citing resources and using facts to back up your claims. Quotes used out of context don't cut it.A very unhappy read. Overall very disappointing and a waste of your time. Hardly worth a review.-John"
4,"Well, I've read them all so why not Parker's foray into teen lit?","If you are an avid Robert B. Parker fan you'll be pleased to know that this one is basically a Junior Spenser novel - It is toned-down but includes all of the trademark characteristics of a Parker novel: smart comments, a girl, thoughts on what it takes to be a man, have honor and be brave, a bad guy and a good guy that solves the problem with a little help from his friends. It is not a bad read for fans of Parker's more adult-oriented series.Parker includes a lot of biographical elements in his books. It is interesting that the lead boy is named Bobbie and his girlfriend is named Joanie, especially considering Robert B. Parker is married to a woman named Joan."
3,Very Good ... But Remakes,"Please note that while these are very good recordings by Freda Payne, they are remakes (not the original hit recordings)."
2,Not The Original Single You Remember and Hear!!!,"Wasted a buck on another Amazon download that is not the version you hear on the radio. You want the one from the Love is Lost album. All the samples sound the same, but the recording are much different."
5,Classic Chick Movie,Celebrate the underdog in this hilarious racy honest female-friendly movie. Get it. Watch it. You'll like it!
3,Not For Me,"I apparently bought this book too far into my diagnoses. Instead of telling you how to deal with MS, it tells you what to expect during the different phases from suspecting through the first year of having been diagnosed."
2,Disappointed,"I purchased this book when I was first diagnosed. This book is only useful if you plan on being whiny/complaining, self-centered, and a burden to your family and friends."
3,Excellent MS book,The item was perfect. It was everything I expected. I have enjoyed reading it and it arrived quickly and in perfect condition.
4,Good introduction to life with MS,"I thought this was a good general introduction for those newly diagnosed with mild symptoms of MS. It's a little less scary than some of the others. Since it's newer then many other books on the market, there is more emphasis on hope for the future.Women will like this book better than men. The emotional & wellness essays are strongest aspect of the book. There were a couple of minor errors in fact but overall a very good book."
2,if you like doctors . . .,"and you're OK with blindly following their advice then this book is for you. I, for one, found it extremely depressing."
5,best book ever written,"this is definetely the best book friedman has ever written. i have read some of his other work, and none of it even compares to this alien shore. i read this book in four days, and picked it up whenever i wasn't buisy. i remember reading it in the theatre before a movie started, to kill time. This book is about a girl, Jasmia, and she is struggling to figure out things about her life that she doesn't understand. it is fast pase, and very creative. It starts out right away, and you will get into it from the very first sentence. regardless of size, i will guarantee that you will love this book."
1,Not as good as her others,"I picked this one up based on my enjoyment of her previous novels, especially the Coldfire Trilogy. But the nail in the coffin of this one was when she referred to DNA as containing amino acids. Any sort of suspension of disbelief was blown then and there. I was already skeptical of the whole premise, and after that I just couldn't finish the book."
5,Great book.,So far this is the best book I've read by this author. It was also the first novel I've read by her and probablystill the best in my opinion. The story line is very good and unique.highly recommended.
4,A great read with a complicated (and intruiging) plot!,"I have, like many of the other reviewers, read and thoroughly enjoyed all of Ms.Friedman's previous work. I was so excited when I saw this one, I had to buy it immediately! It is a pretty great book, with wonderful characters, and imagainative new races of humans. I would agree, though, that the end was a little disappointing. It is the type of thing you get mad at a tv show about... Maybe there is a sequal to follow, and then it wouldn't be so bad. I read it in 4 days, so it couldn't have been that bad!"
4,A great story and book,"I have to agree with the other reviews. It's a great book, great story, not so great ending. Even with the not so great ending, it's still well worth reading."
3,It's really pretty average.,"Ok, I suspect the other reviewers are really big fans of Hagan, because I can't see any other reason for such high ratings. It's your average book about painting that doesn't really teach you anything about painting. Notice that it's a 96 page book with 400 pictures... so most are very small. Comments for them are similar to ""I was after this effect,"" ""I did this ...,"" ""I did that..,"" ""I decided this,"" ""This confirms blah..."" No substance. I never heard of Hagan before buying this book, but it does have a few nice paintings in it. Since I do like the works shown, I give it a 3 instead of a 2. If there were fewer but larger pictures I'd give it a 4."
1,"Useless, Very common info. Nothing Special","There is absolutely nothing special about this book. Maybe for completely Beginner, it is useful, but really in professional world this book has no value whatsoever."
5,Excellent !!,A very quick read. Dr. Frost gets right to the point and provides insights (practical) and mechanics to get a program launched. I highly reccommend this and his other guide.
1,Too Basic,This book is fairly basic. You may instead browse internet and find some good advices on metrics and performance.
5,For the price you can't beat it,"I really enjoyed this book, especially for the price. It opened my eyes to how modern corporate measurements have been evoloving. My copy of this book has lots of sticky notes sticking out of it as there are a lot of novel points I want to go back to. The only bad thing about the book is that it is only 96 pages long. It is easy to read and makes a good reference book. I emailed the author a question and he quickly responded...added bonus."
2,"Easy to read, but superficial","If you know nothing about performance management this is your book. Simple, large letters, wide spacing and easy to read. A lot of general information together.But if you are somewhat equiped in the field: don't buy this book. Not worth the trouble of buying."
2,New Age story telling,"I expected this book to be about what people felt were supernatural interventions in their lives for safety, etc., but it turned out to be more New Age philosophy."
2,It's fine if you live in the desert,"What a disappointment! I usually have great luck with Sony products, but not this one. This unit functions so poorly in humid environments that they've actually printed it up in the ""troubleshooting"" section of the manual! I live in the midwest and would come home in the summer and have to turn on the player 30 minutes before use so that the heat of the machine could ""burn"" the condensation off the laser lens. This is how Sony suggests dealing with this flaw! Even then, I could only get it to work 30% of the time. I took it back after a week and got the panasonic equivalent (only w/ 5 dvd changer!) and have been thrilled with it. Unless you live in a low humidity environment DO NOT BUY THIS!"
4,Great Look and Great Sound,"This system is one of the best out there. Not only does it sound awesome, it looks cool too. If you have a Sony WEGA TV this system will match it perfectly since they are both silver.The only thing that is missing is that there no component cable outputs but the s-video will suffice."
2,"Great for DVD's, Bad for music","The Sony DAVS-300 is great if you plan on using it mainly for playback on DVD's. But don't plan on playing those CD-R's you've burned.......they won't playback on this system. So if CD-R's won't play back I'm assuming CD-RW's are outta the question. I have to use my old AIWA boombox to listen to CD-R discs. Funny how I have a Sony CD-R/CD-RW, use Sony blank CD's, then can't get them to play on Sony equipment."
1,Low tech. specs. for big bucks,I was looking for home theater system with DVD and happened to see this unit. After carefull revue of it's audio range 100Hz-10kHz and THD=10 at surround mode should make it very entry level model.
3,"Good deal, easy setup, mediocre power and features","It's been mentioned that it's easy to set up and that's true - it comes with all speaker wires color -coded. Hookup takes no more than 10 minutes; leading all speaker wires along your baseboards - a few hours. Sound quality is good.NOTE A few annoying features:There is no input for another component - I had to dispose of my tape player, because there is no way to connect it.Power level is adequate for watching movies in a SMALL space - not for playing music at a party - you can turn the sound all the way up and still have a conversation.and the most annoying feature - not mentioned anywhere else - you CAN'T play CDs that you burn on your computer. If I had known that I would probably have gotten a different system."
4,"Decent, and Long Lasting","I purchased this item over 7 years ago but never really used it until very recently. The Sony DVD player has always been the issue, since it doesn't play many file formats such as .avi. Nevertheless, now I have the system wired directly to my T.V. so I can hear 5.1 Surround from the T.V. and even after all these years it sounds great. Recently, I purchased a 7.1 Bowers and Wilkins setup to go in my living room and have decided to move this system to my bedroom (just as another reviewer of this product). I would recommend this system because of its price point (you can get one around $100 or less on ebay) as long as you aren't going to use the DVD player. It only plays original DVDs, not even the ones you get from street vendors in Manhattan. The system sounds good but the wires aren't copper so there is a lot of drop off in sound, I haven't tried to upgrade to better conducting material but its worth a shot if you want to improve performance."
3,Psychodrama with Trauma Survivors,"Some valuable information. As expected, uneven quality among articles. Some authors are stars; others are willingly lost in intergalactic dust clouds of jargon. Editors take a sink-or-swim approach to authors. For the non-specialist, the incomplete index (short on listings for particular items) and absence of a badly needed glossary impair the book's usefulness. All the same, I read it and took notes."
5,Great album,Missed having it in my collection. It is great being able to listen to it again. Been a long time since I had this to listen to.
5,Great!,CD was perfect! Item was exactly as listed! Shipped was great! Jammin' to music from the late 70's! A+! !
5,husband loved it,My husband loves the old music. Nice Christmas present the old music is hard to find so it's nice we can just order it on line.
4,This is lots of fun,"Hercules, as everybody knows, is the son of the chief god Zeus, who is rather promiscuous. Zeus' wife has forgiven Zeus' infidelity and is constantly seeking ways to harm his bastard son Hercules. Many versions of this ancient myth describe Hercules as a nave, immature, not too bright, over-grown, but very strong boy. This series shows the hero as strong and usually, but not always, smart. The film depicts Zeus acting as a somewhat silly oversexed human, and is filled with portrayals of near naked women.Hera stops all fires on earth. She wants to freeze and kill all humanity. Hercules and a local beauty go to the Titan Prometheus for help, for it was Prometheus who first brought fire to mankind. Prometheus tells our hero that he must find the torch of fire that Hera snatched from him. While humanity tries to solve the freeze problem with sacrifices to the gods, Hercules sets off on an adventure to retrieve the torch, which is in the middle of a circle of fire."
4,Aussie surf band Ray Perth West Aus.,I first heard the Taman Shud they played all the music in an late sixties movie called Evolution which featured all the great surfers in aussie at that time. It was all I had heard of the group until now with this cd they were quite advanced for their time. A mixture of jazz and rock and lay back surf music a great cd for its time enjoy.
2,All good things must come to an end.....,"After all the catchy tunes like We like to party, Boom Boom, Sha la la la and Kiss, I must admit I had great expectations to their new track. I have to say that this isn't a typical Vengaboys track. At least not the way I like them. Too slow, too boring and without the party feeling you always get listening to a Vengaboys track. Sorry, but this track will never be found in my CD-player."
4,buy one or the other,"Of course it's a great CD--it's Helen Reddy! But don't do what I did and buy both ""Helen Reddy Christmas"" and ""Helen Reddy, The Best Christmas Ever"". Why? It's the same CD-the second one is the first one with a few more songs. Do I recommend at least one of them? Absolutely."
4,A Nice Christmas with Reddy,"It is so good to hear Helen Reddy singing Christmas carols, and so well. Her voice is missed from radio at Christmas and any other time of year."
4,The other side,Yet another side to Mr. Asprin. A good read. The nuances are great. Well thought out.
3,Mediocre,"This book is okay, but falls terribly short of the excellent humorous sci-fi Myth-tery series of books. It is maybe even slightly less enjoyable than Mr. Asprin's short lived Phule's Army series. The overall story is a combination of various intertwined story lines that do not seem to fit together too well, and sometimes a story is pushed into the background for so long that you forget about it and no longer care when it resurfaces. Also, I personally find the two main characters, both teenage females, a little too similar and I could care less about their teenage insecurities. But, now that I have read the first half of the story, I am hooked and will buy the second half of the story as soon as it is available."
3,Fishing Time,"I did not like this book. To see my hero Skeeter Jackson reduced to some low level JANITOR and then some kind of self appointed protector of dopey tourists was just about all I could stand, though don't miss it if you are a fan of the serise"
2,The Time Scout series fizzles out,"I had really enjoyed Time Scout and its sequel, Wagers of Sin, so I eagerly grabbed a copy of Ripping Time when I found it. The characters were pale imitations of the earlier works in the series. They are now motivated by nothing beyond pure revenge, and the graphic violence in the story (not only in describing Jack the Ripper) gives the whole novel a depressing feeling. Had I not enjoyed the first two books so much, I would not even have finished it.Granted, I did begin to feel interested in the outcome, but only in time to find out that the book doesn't end-- it's just to be continued in a future story. But no matter, these characters are all shallow enough that I will completely have forgotten about them by the time the next book comes out. Buy the sequel? I don't think so."
1,Continued and Extremely Graphic,"I got suspicious about 100 pages before the end of the book thinking that it would be difficult to tie everything up. Sure enough, another of Linda Evans' books that is continued without warning. I've been waiting for over 2 years for the 2nd part to her ""Far Edge of Darkness"" novel and it still hasn't been released. Very irritating.I found the violence to be much more graphic than earlier books in the series; needlessly so. It simply made the book longer so that the authors could make it a 2 parter, and it bogged down what could have been an interesting story line. Don't bother with this one unless you enjoy vivid descriptions of people being cut up. If you do, this book's for you!"
2,Overwhelming,"This study of the Book of John would fit in a detailed college class, not a Sunday School class to explore who Jesus is. This study is too comprehensive and complicated and requires much homework. Definitely neither inviting nor user friendly. However, the introduction is well-written and points out that it is possible to select questions and focus on particular issues, but the mass of material and options are a turn off. Having the actual scripture passage printed in the book would have been very helpful, but scripture isn't included."
2,Not so impressive,These mules are neither comfortable nor impressive to look at. Not a great buy and am considering returning. The two stars is for the shipping from Amazon which was superfast.
4,Another great DVD from Eva!!,"I love this routine! Eva is an excellent instructor and the routine she puts together is interesting, fun and most importantly, the instructions given are sound. My one and only issue is the sound quality. If not for that, I'd give it 5 stars."
5,Right on the money,"This book was fabulous and on the mark. A joy to read, full of wisdom, this was one I wanted to share with friends, family, and colleagues from the first page. I highly recommend it to anybody approaching the end of their school year and looking ahead, or to anyone who knows those anybodies, as a graduation gift."
5,Ball Breaks it Down,"What I found most valuable in this book--besides the sheer entertainment value--was how the author takes what are typically confusing and hush-hush topics (e.g., managing your manager, dealing with difficult coworkers, getting a good promotion, finding a work/life balance), and gets at the root of the issue.It's not a prescriptive as some other books, maybe; there's no ""Step 1, Step 2"" stuff in there. But what Michael Ball does is give you the principles behind all the big issues... Sort of the tool box, and then you go build it however it works for you.If you're looking for the truth behind the curtain, this is definitely your book."
2,Falsely labeled and disappointing,"The title of the product clearly states this: ""Trimaco 449-389 8 by 12-Feet Double Guard Non-Woven/Poly Laminated Dropcloths, 12-Pack,"" and I only got one in the pack, not 12. I would like my other 11 please.As for the product itself, it isn't very durable. Where ever it ripped I would just tape it, so it wasn't too big of a deal since it sticks to the tape pretty well. It did do well absorbing the paint and not letting it leak through. It was nice to not have to track wet paint around, which is what would have happened if I had gotten a plastic one....But seriously, where are my other 11?"
1,Very Disappointed,"I bought this device after years of having a much lower power model work great and this one had good reviews.For lower power applications it has worked weeks flawlessly. Today I finally needed to use it for what I purchased it for. Startup watts on my device is 380 watts and continuous power is around 200. Well under the 800 watt peak of this unit. It died on within a second. Thinking the fuse had blown, I popped it out and it isn't. The unit itself is blown. I hope I'm within the return period and if they don't replace this one, it will be my last purchase of one of their products."
3,"Works great, but....","This product works great! I have it installed in a fleet vehicle to power a laptop charger does a great job. The only con to this product is that it does not have provisions for mounting to a solid surface. Mounting tabs are shown in the description photo, but they are not on the product that was shipped."
5,Great product for plugging electronic devices into your car,"I bought this so I could plug my laptops, phone chargers, portable shaver, etc. into a 3-prong receptacle in my 2010 Camry. The unit makes a little noise, but you can barely hear it if the heat/AC fan is on low or the radio is on. I've been using this on an as-needed basis for months now and have never had any issues. Excellent product for my purposes!!!"
4,Useful,"it works fine, however he/she is careful with the battery of their vehicle you can discharge since without previous warning. I recommend while it is used to light the vehicle like minimum every 2 hours. when it uses my laptop with the inverter to weigh that I work he/she notices that a sharp noise takes place in the inverter and I cause myself since clearly curiosity the laptop this below the load support that the inverter offers me. In general I find a good product to a good price and I recommend it."
1,Doesnt Work,"This thing is unstable, works very inconsistently right off the bat and makes weird loud random electrical noises, buy an inverter of another make..."
1,all verse poorly set,"It's got to be said somewhere and it might as well be here: Kindle does not handle poetry well. Verse is often set as prose, as in the Kindle stand-alone sonnets of Shakespeare. This edition is much better in that respect, but whenever a verse line is too long to fit on one line, it is set as two lines, both with flush left margins (not the usual practice with verse) or even worse, as three lines, all with flush left margins but the last two very short, one or two words apiece. This is hard to read and unnecessary, an obvious computer glitch. On top of that, the prose passages in this volume, and that includes the very important Falstaff scenes, are set in sets of two alternating lines, one normal length, the other quite short, another obvious computer glitch. ALL KINDLE VERSE BOOKS I'VE SEEN SO FAR HAVE SOME OR ALL OF THESE FAILINGS. The problem is systemic: Kindle can't handle verse yet. The rule would seem to be, don't buy poets on Kindle."
5,Great Bracelet,The stones are beautiful on this bracelet. It goes beautifully with my beaded tops. More than worth the money!
5,Very pleased,"I was looking for a travel hairdryer to take on a trip to Europe. I chose this one because it has dual voltage, is foldable, and is available through Amazon Prime for quick shipping. It is rather bulky, but I suppose if it were smaller it wouldn't have the power and other nice features like the speed settings and ""cool"" button. It performed perfectly on the trip (with the addition of a tiny outlet adapter) and is comfortable to hold. Now I keep it in my gym bag. Overall, I recommend this if you want a somewhat more compact but still powerful dryer."
5,Priceless.....,"All of Swamiji's books are truly priceless. His material is over a century old and yet as a novice spiritual seeker, I'm able to comprehend everything. Everyone should read all of his works to get a sense of appreciation for the legacy he has left behind."
2,Overestimated?,"It resulted from lectures about the topics and does not cover the topics deep enough. But although the other yogas from Vivekananda are quite interesting, I was somewhat disappointed with this one. This does not mean, that there would be no good statements in this book, but just not enough of them. Both, karma yogis and bhakti yogis would probaly prefer other books. One may still want to read it, to get a better understanding of Vivekanandas idea of the spiritual path."
4,could be painful,"I do like these. The only problem is that they don't quite fit through the holes of my ear. They almost fit so I could shove them through and endure a little pain, but I'm not quite sure if I'm that brave."
5,Fantastic live jazz/blues album,"I had this John Mayall album on vinyl back in the day. I was browsing music on Amazon one day and saw the CD for a very good price. I decided to buy it since all I had was an old cassette of it, had to get rid of the vinyl several years ago. Very good music for a 3 piece group. My 14 year old son even likes it!"
5,John Mayall Jazz Blues Fusion,"This album is unbelievable. If you like John Mayall and jazz, blues, and rock n' roll you'll love this album. It truly is a fusion of music genres and styles. As harmonica player I love how he is able to interact with the saxophone and other instruments on this album and show how versatile a harmonica can be. I imagine he had to change harmonicas if he is using a diatonic harmonica though I just got the CD and haven't had a chance to try playing along."
5,What got me started,"JBF was an album I bought because I knew and loved JM. What I didn't know was jazz--and this was a perfect entry for me to what I now consider a life-long passion. Like most of the other reviewers, I have worn the grooves flat on this smoker."
2,Pretentious,"Too organized, rehearsed and lackluster. Musicians fearful of making mistakes. It's blues with an attempt at sounding jazzy. Nothing is flying here."
2,"Good effort, no cigar.","I love Mayall and there's no question that he's put together some amazing bands. Sadly, this album falls into the category of ""almost made it"". The band doesn't come together, the solos are weak, especially if you compare these efforts to other jazz efforts of that era. I prefer ""Turning Point"", hands down, for a live Mayall effort to fuse jazz, blues and folk."
2,poor quality,very poor sound and picture quality. the only reason I am keeping it is that it brings back pleasant memories.
4,OK,"This book is helpful for a coach trying to start a program. There are many things that a new coach could use. The ideas worked well for Wooden 30+ years ago, so some of it could be outdated. But most of it is pretty good. The diagrams are confusing. You need a magnifying glass to follow the cuts of the players. More time could have been spent on the stall section."
5,The Bible of the Sport,"Once again, coach Wooden enlightens us with his tremendous insight, not only to the game, but in all aspects of life.At 31 years of age, and starting my coaching endeavors, I can remember back in my high school playing days, seeing my coach reviewing this book that looked like a text book, over to one side of the gym. This is it, the one book that shows and says it all....From the Wizard himself....John Wooden the legend...There will never be another one like him!"
5,Could use an update,"I have a ton of books on various aspects of coaching basketball, and this is by far the most comprehensive resource I own. I particularly appreciate Coach Wooden's attention to detail and his down-to-earth, methodical approach.I'd give it 4.5 stars if that were possible, just because this edition looks like it was run off on a photocopy machine, particularly the photos, but in terms of content, it's almost certain to be the most valuable book in a basketball coach's library."
2,Read This One Later,"First, if you have never read Sax Rohmer before, DO NOT start with this one. Start with Rohmer's ""The Green Eyes of Bst"" or ""The Golden Scorpion"" (free for Kindles). Although ""The Yellow Claw"" does have some interesting plot ideas, it does drag in spots; however, it makes up for it in the last third of the book. So, read this one (which has Rohmer's French detective, Gaston Max) later. Rohmer is most famous for creating the infamous character of Fu Manchu who later became even more famous in the black and white movies of the 30's. Fu Manchu was portrayed in various films by Boris Karloff in the 1930's. Several of the first Fu Manchu novels are also available for free on the Kindle or search out the actual books in used bookstores - they are worth the time to discover the great, intellectual (and stereotypical) evil genius who is Fu Manchu."
2,Only ONE (1) 40 minute class,"It never occurred to me that there would only be ONE workout on an entire CD. The product page may state it.Just BEWARE that this is pretty expensive for a SINGLE workout class.IMO, it's very poor value. Your mileage may vary."
2,Glare and Reflections a problem,"This factory protective screen does just that. It protects the fragile lenticular screen from being damaged. HOWEVER, as with any factory protective screen it gives off glare. Trying to watch TV during the daytime is a problem if you have windows in the same room as the TV. You will see your windows and lamps in the reflection of the TV protective screen. The only solution to eliminate the glare is to replace the factory protective screen with a non-glare Mighty Shield protective screen. They come out to you and custom fabricate the protector to your TV. They set up the installation date and time when it is convenient for you!The website is [...]."
3,Good but not as good as her short stories,When I heard that Susanna Carr was going to have a full length novel released I was excited. But for some reason this story did not keep my interest as much as her short stories. Maybe it is because there are just too many of the small town guy vs. big city girl (or want to a be big city girl) stories out there right now for it to make any real impression on me. I just think right now she shows real talent for the short story but needs a little work in developing the a story into a full length book.
4,here on sunset boulivard,"wonderful story, but predictable. wonderful score and singing all around. no wonder glenn close got famous after that. not one of webbers best shows but definately a good show. i have the album and know all the songs. sad ending but arent they all now a days."
3,"great pictures, no advice","Yes, the photos are gorgeous and inspirational. Just don't buy this book for any practical advice, because it has none."
1,No insight and no valid analysis,"In my opinion, I believe that Woodworth's treatment of this great campaign is best described as ""a book with no soul."" There are some well-known facts, but, more importantly, there are omission of many, many other facts that would (not surprisingly) undermine the author's numerous ""traditional"" assertions.Furthermore, the author's comments in the text and in the Bibliographical Essay that deal with trying to puff up his friends/colleagues while at the same time trying to discount/demean others not part of the author's ""circle,"" are laughable and transparent. In the end, I believe that this book offers no furthering of knowledge and only reinforces some disproven myths about Gettysburg.For a good general read on Gettysburg, I believe that Glenn Tucker's ""High Tide at Gettysburg"" is far, far superior to Woodworth's."
3,Wolf,"A girl called Cassy lives with her nan and she is called away to see her mother who is always moving house. She finds her mother, but Cassy also comes across two other men who live with her. They make wolf masks and put a type of explosive in them. . . . . .I would recommend this book to Year 8 or 9 students.Nick"
5,marble run set,"I bought this marble-run set (62-piece) for my 6- and 8-year-old grandchildren. It took about an hour to come up with a good design (we rejected the suggested designs), but after we got the hang of it, my grandchildren played with this set for hours."
2,An O.K. book for reading about privileged people aging.,"I was disappointed in this book. It detailed the thoughts of women turning 60 who had many advantages in life, in terms of education, family help and encouragement, the luck to connect with the right mentor at the right time. I would have been much more interested in the thoughts of less privileged women, more ordinary women. I couldn't help thinking that it may be easier to have a positive view of aging if you are already a woman of accomplishment by the time you hit your forties. For some, the greatest accomplishement of their lives may be successfully raising a family, completing an advanced education later in life or simply a life devoted to volunteerism. I'd be interested in their thoughts. That's what I thought I was getting, at least in part. A nice mixture of women from different socio-economic groups would have been most welcome."
3,Excellent live recording.,"FROM EVERY STAGE is a bit too political for my tastes, but when she concentrates on making music instead of a statement, she's in fine form. A great live version of her classic song ""Diamonds and Rust"", and beautifully sung covers of Dylan's ""Forever Young"" and Emmylou Harris's ""Boulder to Birmingham"" are among the highlights. The greatest moment on this double disc, however, is Dylan's ""Lily, Rosemary and the Jack of Hearts"", which is alone worth the price of this concert recording."
3,Last of the Good Old Times,"There are some ""good old tunes"" in this collection. But, the best of JB lies in the past. I enjoy her as a folk singer. When she reaches beyond that pure genre her voice and musical talents remain the same, but, the styles and format just do not produce the same magic."
3,Mildly visionary,Innovative experiments and timeless melodrama comes packaged between dated schmaltz on this sometimes intriguing but ultimately unnecessary compilation.
3,good but hissy...taking it back,"Really sounds great, but the speakers hiss way more than they should. I've seen this complaint by others on other sights as well. I bought mine last night and I'm taking mine back."
3,Would have given it 5 stars but......,the remote is useless in the dark...glow in the dark remote...shessh...multi function remote which only works if your eyes are 20/20 and all the lights in the room are on....otherwise I love it and I would have given it 5 stars so the choice is yours...
4,Stop me if you've heard this...,"A great bunch of songs that nicely fill in that niche in all of our collections called: nothing else like it. Imminently catchy rhythms and melodies. THE COSMOPOLITANS capture a moment between punk and new wave that is eerily enjoyable. And get this, these gals possess the hallmark of what separates a truly great pop/rock band from an ordinary one...the harmonica. Great harp licks all over the place. Plus, a healthy dose of lyrics that are clever, quirky and absurd. Tongue-in-cheek is their modus operandi. If you like early B-52s, Cyndi Lauper, XTC, The Suburbs, Hoodoo Gurus, Oingo Boingo or Wall of Voodoo, you'll enjoy the novelty of their songs, and soon find yourself realizing that these gals are more than refreshing...they're good!"
1,Get two!,"I bought it so my cat would not pick under my bedroom door at 3 a.m. to tell me she's hungry and wants breakfast NOW. Instead of picking under my door, she picked around the mat, which was just as annoying. If I leave my bedroom door open a crack with the mat in front, she just jumps over it and into the room. I think two mats placed side by side across my doorway would work best, but for now I think I'll go back to piling blankets and pillows in front of the door so I don't hear her picking and scratching. I'm sure it will work fine for chairs and counters, but my cat doesn't have that problem. Oh well, live and learn."
1,very disappointed,"When I bought this tool all I wanted is to have something available to do a little at home coaxial work, so I never expected to be purchasing a professional grade tool for the price that I paid. I did however expect the tool to last more than 1 crimp! After making my first (an only) crimp with the crimpers I noticed that the tool hard warped and no longer lined up at the fitting opening. I am disappointed to say the least, but at least I didn't pay much for the disappointment."
3,Good for the cost,"Looks like they will do the job. I try and lean toward USA made tools, however, when the nearest US tool is $50 and I will only probably use this once every three years...gotta go cheap."
3,So so,"This cd is ok @ best but... the reason I got it was bc a friend of mine loves the Spanish version of ""If You Were Mine."" We got the song, I'm happy, she's happy... mission accomplished ;)"
4,Best Practices from Effective Churches,"Wilkes has provided excellent insights into what practices are actually fruitful not in his own words, but in the words of pastors and lay leaders around the United States. It is not written as a primer on church leadership, but rather invites leaders from exemplary churches to share what they have learned about how God is working in and through their churches. It is a diverse bunch of churches and not a one-size fits all prescription. Emminently practical and based on observations of pastors and lay leaders in the trenches bringing the gospel to bear in this very challenging time."
2,Pretty but Made In China,"We purchased these mugs precisely because the description say,""Made in Britain of high-quality earthenware"". The box and the mugs says they are made in China. Very disappointed and will not use them. Pretty enough though..."
5,Wilson Brothers more valuable than ever!,"With the recent death of Steve Wilson, this band's 1970's rarity will become even more valuable. Steve and Kelly Wilson wrote great songs of love and loss, do amazing covers of rock standards such as Todd Rundgren's ""Can We Still Be Friends"", and have a sound reminiscent of great groups like TOTO, Steely Dan and more. They are backed up by studio staples STEVE LUKATHER, JON GOIN,STEVE GIBSON, ERNIE WATTS and more, so it's unfortunate this band got overlooked and dropped by Atlantic/ATCO right after their successful tour in Japan. As a result, the disc is only available as an import from there, where they are still wildly popular (do a search on their name and see). Steve and Kelly both went on to write songs performed by other artists. I think this record proves my adage about the music business: ""It's not about being good"". If it was, this band would be there in the lexicon with the other greats, instead of relegated to the cutout bin. These guys ROCK!"
4,Stellar Mystery Thriller,Double crosses and hidden motives abound as ex cop Phil Broker tries to find out who murdered his ex-wife Caren - killed as she was coming to him for help. Nice sense of place (upstate Minnesota) and good characters - especially Broker and ex partner Keith Anglund.
4,sturdy boat hook,This telescoping pole hook comes in handy and is not flimsy like many others. Glad I selected it. You will be glad to have a boat hook that is heavy enough and works well for the job.
4,Donna B,"The Partners Flatbread Style Cracker, Cracked Black Pepper were delicious. I received a box of the crackers as part of a gift package and was immediately hooked. I knew I had to order more and was not disappointed with the subsequent boxes. Only one thing to report, all of the boxes of crackers were broken when I received them. I am sure this was due to shipping."
3,shadow mothers: stories of adoption and reunion,Good book. but many case examples with no research to back them up.
2,Not as Described,"When someone measures a screen for a glare screen it is diaganally corner to corner on the inside. Our laptop is exactly 15"" this way. This glare screen is 15"", but from the outside corners. In other words it cut off over 1/2"" of screen and we can't use it.Anyone want one? Cheap?"
4,This cookbook is a gateway to healthier eating habits.,"Down Home Cookin' Without the Down Home Fat is a great cookbook for those who were raised on high-fat comfort foods. The book offers tasty renditions of cheesy tuna casserole, no-bake eclairs, and many more marvelous desserts and main dishes that are high in flavor and low in fat. These recipes are perfect for people who want to change their eating habits, but who are really not inclined to eat ""health foods."""
5,"Wonderful book, that removes fat , and leaves you smiling!","What a great book, I loved all my favorite recipes, slimmed down-and they still manage to taste great! I would recommend it to anyone. I love the veggie pizza recipe, the teriakyi beef, the stroganoff...wonderful!!!! Thanks Dawn!!!!!"
2,"X Rated. If you like Porn, this is for you","While the book itself is pretty good (focusing on Zhu Irzh), I was completely off-put by the hard-core porn scenes (like you can get in Penthouse Letters [though with only 2 demons]).If I want good porn, I'll hit the internet. Otherwise, it's just filler (or a bad excuse to prop up sales?)"
4,Good read,"Roller coaster ride of action and supernatural interest. Inspector Chen's return to sort things out complicates matters, however, as the pair tracks other suspects, including an enigmatic demon the corporation has been harboring for experimental purposes and a celestial goddess whose unlikely alliance with hell threatens to rain chaos down on the earthbound."
3,The Dog Who Saved Halloween,My granddaughter loves Halloween and dogs so I thought this movie would be a hit. Unfortunately it was not. She was bored by it and I have to say I was too. There are some great Halloween movies out there with dogs this just isn't one.
1,Bad disc,"This is not a bad review of the movie. This is a bad review of the disc and the return policy. I tried it in 3 different high quality DVD players and it would not load. I purchased this at the end of July, but because it was a Halloween movie, I didn't try to watch it until October 1. By then I couldn't return it for a new one without a penalty and the DVD was under $5, so it wasn't worth the penalty. I think an exchange for a new disc at no charge would be appropriate in this situation."
1,Awful movie.,"This movie was really really awful. I bought this thinking it would have to be somewhat cute since there was a dog in it, but it was just terrible. I couldn't wait for the movie to be over and my 8-year-old didn't like the movie either."
3,Fun For The Kids,"We purchased this as a treat for the kids and to have some family friendly Halloween movie time. As far as the kids go, this movie was just great. It did not keep me or my wife entertained but I suppose that was secondary priority for this purchase.The story is the typical wonderdog saves the family-in-trouble parents have all seen before. I ended up hooked into Beethoven twice, I don't know why this one didn't grab me the same way.At the end of the day, the kids have fun with it and it helped us fill a gap in nonn-animated child-friendly Halloween films."
2,not that great,"this was not that great of a movie. my kids wanted to watch it for family movie night. they thought it was ok, but not very entertaining."
2,This movie was just okay,This movie was okay. It was actually a pretty scary movie for very young children - we ended up turning it off. This is better for older children and adults.
1,Computer Memory,The discription for this product was wrong and the vendor blamed Amazon. When processing the return the vendor messed up the the credit by 300% in their favor and Amazon had to fix it.
2,A little too much fluff,"The book is not quite what I had hoped. I wanted to find help for the specific manifestations of my husband's reactions to his upbringing. Pretty much I found only pep talks. While pep talks are great, they don't help us understand how to overcome the problems. I still feel like we're on our own to grope our way through."
4,"Good read, valuable information","Although I'm only half way through this book, It has some very validating information and is a good source for dealing with life, moving forward and finding what is most important. Some of Dr. Laura's comments seem harsh and blunt, but that is her style. It will probably be a book to keep and reference at difficult personal times."
1,very poorly thought out,If you experienced serious childhood abuse I strongly feel this is not the book for you.The book does not address the permanent changes trauma may make in the brain. Complex childhood abuse can leave an individual with a condition similar to that experienced by some soldiers after severe combat conditions.This book made me feel badly about myself as I am one of those unlucky souls who cannot fight off the depressions and anxiety left by a childhood of being sexually abused/raped over and over again.
1,Don't bother reading,"This book was a waste of time. Dr. Laura's supposed ""insights"" left me wondering if she thinks that the general public is lame. The advise given in the book could have been written by a six-year-old."
1,Hogwash,"What a phony! Laura is writing out of her league, again. She has no idea what real child abuse is or how it affects the adult. Just another money grubber."
3,Bad Childhood Good Life,Thought it would give more concrete steps to get past a Bad Childhood. It was a very slow read. Still am trying to make my way through it. Usually I just love her books and cant put them down.
1,I hated this book.,"Thank God I got this book from the library instead of buying it. I can boil Dr. Laura's advice down to three words: ""Get over it!"" There is NO good advice in this book, just the repeated exhortation to put it all behind you. Well, some of us can't and the title of her book is VERY misleading. Give this one a pass."
4,Bad Childhood Good Life,"The book contains good suggestions for a productive life, and useful ideas and concepts to overcome difficult life experiences, but only if the reader is ready to implement them. The author, by sharing her own challenging experiences at the end, validated for me that she understands and has lived and found a need for doing what is encompassed in the book.I have given a copy of the book to each of my children with an apology for the 'bad childhood' I gave them. I feel I made a honest effort to break the cycle and not pass on the things I had to live through to my children. I know I didn't succeed entirely, but I know the things I view as being the worst of my childhood were left in my childhood. I hope it gets them on their own road to full, happy adulthood. I'm glad the author took the time and made the effort to help others grow and progress and be happy."
3,Needs an editor,The book is mostly excerpts from her show which is entertaining. The book is just riddled with gramatical and typographical errors though. It appears that there was no editing done at all before it was released. I thought that published works were supposed to be edited better than that. People just can't write these days and this is a clear example.
3,Reads like one size fits all advice,"I felt this book was overgeneralized. It seemed like Dr. Laura wrote a rather general advice and then applied it to every single person, no matter whether they were an orphan, raised by an alcoholic, or sexually molested. There's just not much depth to what she says. It's not that what she writes isn't good, but I think she took a very broad subject and tried to cover it in one book. Dealing with self-sabatoge, self-esteem, closure, adult parental relationships, anger issues, ect. all deserve books of their own. Cramming them all into this short book doesn't do them justice."
4,"If this is an issue you need to get handled, get the book.","'Instead of resolving to lose these pesky 10 pounds, 2006 may be the perfect time to stop letting a bad childhood ruin another year,' says Schlessinger, author of seven New York Times bestsellers and host of an internationally syndicated radio talk show.Despite what you might think of her views and opinions, her books continue to address specific personal issues we've all felt at some time in our lives.- GiddyupGuy"
5,Brilliant,I loved this book. I'm playing catch up with differential equations in graduate school and picked up this volume to learn about the Fourier equation. It was an engaging and entertaining way to learn the mathematics. But it's insights into learning and pedogogy were even more fascinating. Clearly a unique kind of book. I'd certainly recommend it to anyone involved in teaching math or the sciences.
5,A must buy for all students,Most math teachers can't teach. Whatever they do largely amounts to 'telling' as opposed to teaching. This book written by Japanese students is a gem. It is a rarity to find a book where the reader will share the authors experience and enthusiasm of discovery. Buy this book and learn what mathematics is all about.
3,Good for specifics,"This was a pretty cool book. It's been 25 years since looking at any kind of Calculus text and well, one night I was thinking to myself just how much of this stuff did I learn in the first place.The chapters on differentiation and integration were well done. From a cultural perspective the little cartoons were fun for awhile but got tiring fairly soon after getting into the text. Also, it would have been nice to have real life problems, for example, distance, velocity, acceleration, popultions, etc. showing applications of the aforementioned functions. 3.5 stars"
5,Knowing _how_ is OK. This book teaches _why_.,"Why a 10 rating? Acknowledging the rigor of Fourier classics such as Bracewell and Hamming, this book doesn't stop at mathematical proof, but gives the reader the intermediate steps, those steps usually ignored in texts but included in lectures. Want to _perform_ Fast Fourier Transforms (FFTs)? Buy some software. Want to _understand_ them? Read this book."
5,the best thing...ever....,"Kitty loved this window hammock so much! Unlike, the other window seats that are like a hard plastic shelf, this hammock droops down when she sits in it-so comfy! She just loves it! Plus..it keeps her off the counter, table, or any other thing she decides will help her get the best look at Mr. Squirrel. It doesn't screw into the wall either. It uses balance legs and a mega strip of velcro is helpful. This item is a must have!!!!"
5,Years of Cat Napping Pleasure,"For napping in the sun's warmth or watching the outdoors, the Cat Napper for years now has been a daily pleasure for my cats. My 2 customer images show how even heavy cats can enjoy the Napper: One picture shows a 12 lb and a 16 lb cat both in the Napper, but it's sagging, so I provided it with a bit of underneath support, with the adaptation shown in the other picture. The Napper's cover comes off for periodic cleaning. Also, it's never broken, unlike another perch I owned."
1,Won't last longer than 8 months!,"We loved our cat napper, well, our cats loved it! They sat in it every day for about 8 months. Sometimes they'd sit together, but mostly apart (one is 8 pounds, one 10).Unfortunately the frame broke. Both plastic sides snapped and broke, rendering it useless and dangerous since it broke when one got on it. I do NOT recommend something that will break in 8 months!!***UPDATE- I did email Fleximat directly and they are sending me a new frame free of charge. I just hope these last longer, but was very pleased at their willingness to rectify the situation!***"
2,Fabric doesn't stay in place,"I've had this product for over a year now, and it worked great when my cats were kittens. As they grew, though, and maxed out at about 11 pounds each, the fabric wouldn't stay in place; the little nubbies that are supposed to catch the fabric don't (and in some cases, the fabric has ripped) and cause the area the cat sits in to suddenly lower and a gap occurs between the window ledge portion of the frame and the material. The first time it happened, my cat's backside slid right into that gap and she got hung up there. The second time, a few moments ago, the cat managed to jump away, but that's it, it's getting taken down. I'm afraid they're going to get hung. I can see no way of securing that fabric so that it doesn't do this; it can't be tucked under the frame because it then blocks the velcro securing it to the window sill."
4,Your cat will love this!,"My cat loves his cat napper. He gets to look out the window, is elevated high enough to see most everything that's going on in the house and he looks pretty darn cute in it too. He's gone from trying to balance himself on the back of the couch, to hanging out in style and comfort. I'm just waiting for spring to come so I can put it in a window facing the backyard. The reasone I gave it four stars was because setting it up took a little more time than I thought, but it's not very difficult. The velcro that is used to stick the napper to the window ledge doesn't stick the best, but it's enough. I've had it for two weeks now and the cat has jumped, pounced and launched himself off of it many times and it has not fallen off yet."
1,The book was missing pages!,"As I was reading this book, I got through a few chapters and then felt like I had already read what I was reading. I then realized the book started over at a couple chapters in and was missing a whole section. Disappointed!"
4,"Excellent tool! Reasonable price...on Amazon, at least.","I've wanted a wire tracker for years, but was not willing to pay the ridiculously high prices on the models like the Greenlee 501 Tracker II, which run anywhere from $600-900, for no apparent reason other than profit margin, I might add. This unit is just as useful as the overpriced models with the receiver antenna at the end of a tube with a handle, which is the only real difference here. I've used a 501 many times before, and this little unit is just as useful and capable. Also takes up less room in the truck!"
4,This is an awesome EP,"Better than Showtime, As Is sounds alot like the flipsides to the singles on Showtime, a darker, truer sound. Lovesick is a classic."
5,Warm Hands,Great gloves. They keep my hands warm while still letting me use my fingers without interference. I love them.
1,the mongols,horrible washed out print of a great italian b movie from the sixties almost unwatchable
2,GREAT MUSIC SCORE; LOUSY PRINT,"After obtaining this movie years ago on VHS, I had high hopes for the DVD. Not so. Sinister Films has done nothing to improve the picture quality which, at times, appears to be almost devoid of color. The only saving grace is a beautiful score by Mario Nascimbene (SOLOMON & SHEBA, BARABBAS, CARTHAGE IN FLAMES, THE VIKINGS, ALEXANDER THE GREAT, ETC.) which unfortunately has never been independently released though promised decades ago on vinyl. Perhaps Peplum will yet release this score on CD."
4,worked,"very strong productwill not use it unless i really cant breathI will use on high mold seasons ,I use a enhailer also"
3,Hard to Review Something You Haven't Gotten Yet!,I have used this product in the past and love it. I gave the review a 3 star only because I have not received it yet. It was supposed to be here by July 21st and today is July 25th and I still have not receive it! I will never order from this company again!
3,did it work?,I've been taking this for a few weeks now and I honestly can't say I've noticed any results. I still have a sinus infection although not as bad. Probably won't buy this again.
1,Not too sure sure...,I took these for two weeks along with seriously increasing the humidity in my home and water I was drinking. I thought they were working great. But three days ago I simply quit taking the 4 a day I had been taking just to see... And to give myself a break from the diarrhea they cause. I don't even know why THAT ingredient is in there. Not mush use. Anyway I have seen NO CHANGE. In the three days that I have stopped I still did all the water and humidity. So they might help if you don't want to do all that but didn't do me a whole lot if good I'm sorry to say.
5,ANCIENT WORDS OF MARITAL WISDOM: FOR THE NEW MILLENNIUM,"FINALLY A BOOK WRITTEN THAT DOESN'T WANT TO TELL YOU HOW TO LOVEOR HAVE A RELATIONSHIP. THIS BOOK SIMPLY GUIDES YOU INTO USING YOUR OWN GOOD SENSE AND INTELLIGENCE REGARDING YOUR LOVE, LIFE AND RELATIONSHIP. A MUST READ FOR THOSE WHO ARE TIRED OF MALE OR FEMALE-BASHING. A MUST READ FOR THOSE WHO WANT TO DEAL WITH THE REALITIES OF LOVE, ADMIT THAT RELATIONSHIPS ARE HARD; HAVE THE RIGHT TO ENJOY THE WONDERFULLNESS AND JOYS OF LOVE AND TO LEARN HOW TO BUILD STRONG FOUDATIONS WHEN THE HARD PARTS OF LOVE SURFACE.

IT SHOWS THE BEAUTY OF A PARTNER RELATIONSHIP AND THE FACT THAT WE ALL DESERVE THE BEST AS WE TRY TO DELIVER THE BEST IN RETURN! A WONDERFUL BOOK!"
4,"good, big, fit is difficult","My bad I didn't look more closely at the specs, but this thing is 9' both ways -- very large. I put it in my attic and got great reception.I did have a problem joining the sections. the aluminum isn't forgiving. I had a hard time getting a section to go together, so I hit a bit hard. that put it beyond the screw hole. No way to go back to the proper spot. It still works as the other pieces have ovals for their screws."
4,Great book,"Not much how - to in this book. this is the book you are looking for if you are an intermediate tier or thinking of going commercial. It is recognized WORLD WIDE and has many many many patterns and recipes.It won't bog you down with instruction on how to use or apply the material, but gives you a clear image of the fly, and lists what material is used for hook, body, tail, etc. A great suppliment to your tying desk if you would like to work on some professional looking flies.Certainly in the must have category"
3,Adaptations of the Books plus some fluff,"Children periodically fall into a cultus for cartoon characters. In France the word is ""personages"" which captures a bit of the flavour of the endearment certain characters invoke. ""Madeline"" is such a character.If your daughter has fallen in love with Madeline, eventually you will consider buying the DVDs for rainy days. The complete ""Collector's"" set presents a bargain, for the weaker offerings in the cartoon series are cleverly paired with a stronger must-have cartoon (each disc contains two shorts). In other words, if you try to beat the box price you will miss ""Madeline at the Ballet"" (excellent) while trying to skip ""Madeline in New York"" (tedious).My wife and I pre-screen everything our children see, and this is harmless.I strongly encourage coupling the DVDs with reading to children aloud the original Madeline stories as an excellent introduction to light verse."
4,missing parts but great customer service,"The bra fits fine but was missing two hooks. Also it says ""Le Bra"" on it. Tried to call customer service but they were closed. Called a few days later and customer service was outstanding! Sending me the missing parts totaly corrected the issue."
2,bad product,1 week after i installed this product it tore from the strech points and hopefully i can repair it
3,Good product overall,"I found this product fairly easy to put on my car. There are a few problems however. First, The hood portion of the cover tends to pull up and not stay in place. Second I now have scratches on the hood of my car because of the cover rubbing."
3,"Not the originals, but good.","Despite the picture of the original Pioneers on the cover, this is much later. The liner notes don't date any of the songs, but the compilation date is 1990. Good music for the Western song lover. Oldies, Cool Water, to newer, Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain."
4,"Useful for the LDS historian, but quite expensive...","Probably in effort to make up for failure to produce ""Papers of Joseph Smith vol. 3,"" Jessee here republishes his long touted necessity of all LDS scholars' personal libraries ""Personal Papers of Joseph Smith."" The new edition removes some of the Hofmann forgeries (Patriarchal blessing of Joseph III, Anthon manuscript, etc.) and updates some of the erroneous footnotes of the first version, as well as the introduction of a new letter or two sent by the Prophet. The reader will be especially interested in the letter correspondance between Governer Thomas Ford and the prophet prior to the martyrdom. This is an expensive book, and I recommend it only for the Joseph Smith history enthusiast, as the casual reader/learner may find his personal writings difficult to navigate or search. Those interested in the doctrine taught by the prophet should continue to seek the usual sources (TPJS, WJS, etc.) as this book is predominately historical."
2,The Whole Truth?,"The breathless, sycophantic tone of the inside flap sets the tone of the book. ""What would it have been like to have known the Prophet Joseph Smith, to have seen him face to face, to have heard his words?"" Sounds like the start of a teenage romance novel to me. One star for sycophancy.However, the book is indeed Personal Writings of Joseph Smith, and not The Personal Writings of Joseph Smith, and so another star for honesty. These cherry-picked letters etc. are selected to make the Prophet the wholesome hero of Pioneer America, and the original documents are reproduced to show their verisimilitude. But so much has been omitted to produce this enviable man that the evidence would be shot down in court - remember, the truth, THE WHOLE TRUTH, and nothing but the truth? This book is good on number one and number three, but paints a happy picture only by ignoring number two."
1,Not for the Faint of Heart,The title is completely misleading. This is a very intense yoga tape paced far beyond what is traditionally done in most yoga classes. It is more like power yoga. She moves way too quickly between poses. There is no instruction and it is very difficult to keep up.
4,Great DVD for the Home,One of the better Home Yoga DVDs you can buy. Purchased the DVD from a magazine recommendation and my girlfriend and I have not been disappointed.
3,A Fun Read,A gay mystery with an adventurous Hairdresser as the main character. Gay mountain climbers will especially enjoy the scenes in Yosemite. With some other interesting characters in tow and a cat namedsugar Baby
4,One Man's View,I like the way Rothman writes. I also recognize that this is one man's view of how Las Vegas became what it is. I think anyone asking what happened to unions should read this book.
2,Neon Metropolis,"Although well written, this book has many flaws. It is very pro-union and fails to mention the fact that unions, especially in this town are [bad]. Where else can a slacker maintain his job? The book also is a very hard read and goes on endlistly about dribble!"
1,Reliability?,"We have been using the Attwood 750 pumps to supply water to other equipment, and have them mounted in the bottoms of 30 gallon tanks and switched on manually when needed. I am looking at other models of pumps from Sahara to find an equivalent to the Attwood to replace them. We have gone through 5! of the 750's in just over 200 hours of equipment running time, and the motors have all just seized up and blown fuses. I would expect a life of years and thousands of hours from one of these pumps, as comparable to a fountain pump that runs all day for the entire summer. Not likely here.On the plus side, it does self prime and pump water well for short periods of time... I would just hate to have this item in my bilge, ostensibly to save me from sinkin'."
4,Mixed Blessings,"The Houdini behaved as advertised; I was able to get the ball up and it offered more control than the driver used previously. However, from the beginning, it seemed as if there was a net loss of distance. More second shots from the fairway was a fair trade-off for awhile. I'm moving to a JMax Carbon with less loft and a draw bias. Still a firm believer in Tour Edge equipment."
5,A Need to Have Bood,"I am very thankful to all of the vets and animal behaviorists who contributed to this book. I use it a LOT. From everything to stomach problems to aches and pains to....whatever the problem is. This book covers it from A to Z.If you love your dog or cat, and don't have the money to go to the vet for every problem that pops up, this book is a godsend. It also offers alternative medicines that actually are better for your pet.I just simply cannot get along without my copy of ""Home Remedies for Dogs and Cats""."
2,Wholesome Hide Retriever Roll,"I read a great review of the product in The Whole Dog Journal but when I received the product it didn't look anything like the quality one shown in the magazine. What I received actually looked like the kind of rolls shown that you would not buy.(One that has a nice outer layer but is scrunchd in the center) A good quality U.S. raised cattle roll is made from a single sheet of fresh, thick, natural rawhide which is what I thought I was getting. I do commend the seller for the quick service!"
2,"Sketchy, difficult to follow on a step-by step basis","From the onset. this book must assume the reader has a familiarity with Frontpage 2000,since it takes a lot for granted in its instructions. I struggled through the first seven chapters but hit a brick wall at chapter 8. The chapter on framing is vague and illusive. This book would have been better if it were more precise with it's directions and assumed less foreknowledge of the reader. I bought this book to learn how to use Frontpage 2000. The author assumes that I already know how to use this program...a poor assumption."
4,not a book for first timers,"at first when I read this book, I didn't learn too much untill I actually took a course in Frontpage2000. Now the book is easy to read and understand. So if its ur first book its not the way to go, otherwise its very good."
5,very interesting compilation,"I bought this book as I wanted to get to know more about aromatherapy. I am interested in working with the emotional and psychological side of ourselves, not only the physical. I also like the fact she mentions preparations for the chakras, which is unsual to find elsewhere. Very good appendixes and quite a good read.Compré este libro para saber más sobre aromaterapia. Me interesa todo lo que concierne el lado emocional y psicológico de nuestros seres, no sólo lo físico. Me interesó que el autor mencionara también los chakras. Los apendices son muy buenos. Un libro muy interesante."
5,book review,Fun book for teaching about insects as food sources. Book arrived in excellent condition. Thanks!
4,John's Wisdom,This is an awesome book. It is a little hard reading and slow going but very informative of the fourth gospel. I would recommend this book to anyone that is interested in learning more about this gospel.
3,Creepy sounds...,"Maybe that's not what I was looking for, that's why I got disappointed!If you are looking for objects sounds or creepy voices only... then this is a good CD for you due to the high variaty of sounds available.But if you are (like me) mainly looking for creepy ""music"" accompanied by creepy voices and sounds, this CD would not satisfy you."
4,"Good inrro to Hopi myth, legend and world view","For people who have heard about Hopis, and know enough about them to consider them a highly representative descendant of the Ancestral Puebloans, but nothing more, this is a decent book. It has stories of their origin from the third world, legends of tribal and clan migrations, and actual history, such as the split at Oraibi and the destruction of Awatovi.But, one of the things many people with just base-level knowledge of Hopis may be interested in is kachinas. The author includes neither any critical study of their origin (Mexico, ultimately, via the Mimbres culture of SW New Mexico), nor any Hopi myths that focus on dances or ceremonies of kachinas."
3,What you should do before reading this book.,This is a good book filled with information. However before you read this book you should read (Book of The Hopi) by Frank Waters. Reading the (Book of the Hopi) first it will help you understand this book.
3,Not Bad,"I enjoy the ""The Prophet Joseph Smith"" a bit better. There are great stories and interesting facts, but this set of CD's is not as informative or entertaining as his first."
5,Very nice book!,"I just bought this book.I really can't wait to start creating my own Fairly Odd Parents characters.I love the animation style featured on this show.I'm also a fan of Mucha Lucha, The Flintstones and Hey Arnold.I wish there was a ""How To Draw The Flinstones"" book.I'm bought this book so I can create my own cartoon characters.I enjoy watching this show and I really like the artwork.I also started to get the ""How To Draw Monsters Inc"" book.Now I'm just waiting for a ""How To Draw Mucha Lucha"" book."
4,Works Well With Science Diet,"Alone this product helped our older shepherd mix with his hip problems but have achieved great results with changing his diet to the new Science Diet for increased mobility. Combined, they have him playing again like a puppy!"
1,For the casual Paul Anka fan,"This collection is very misleading. Paul Anka had forty top 40 hits from 1957 to 1978 & only sixteen are represented here. I say ""represented"" because they are not the originally recorded hits. They are re-recordings, but it will not tell you that on the description of the CD. Beware...if you are looking for original recordings...don't buy this collection."
5,brother loves it,My brother says say cheese and die is his favorite Goosebumps ever. When I was younger I liked it too.
3,This is not the original film,"I've seen the original film and I can clear up the confusion: this is not quite the original. There are two key scenes cut out of this version. The transfer to Blu-ray is great. However, the film itself is muddled with the two missing key scenes. If you are looking for the complete uncut film - this is not it."
4,Great film 4 fans of the macabre,First of all a lot of other reviewers said this film was the goriest film and most bizaare they had ever seen. Not me this film is shocking and has plenty of gut churning moments in it but the end was predictable when he remembers when he walks in the warehouse in the last 15 minutes. Dont get me wrong the film is very good and a great lead performance so I will give it that. To me the most shocking film I have ever viewed is Nekromantic. To me its the most sick and twisted film I have ever seen and I dont think any other film will change my mind. So if your a sick and twisted film fan as I am definetely check it out.
1,Not a horror but a sexually sadistic piece of garbage,"I was so excited to see the uncut version as I was under the impression this was a top notch horror film. Well its not!! There is no element of horror at all to this film. Its a descent into sexual deviance of the worst kind. There is some gore but nothing of shock value. The only thing shocking to me is the amount of people that enjoyed this film. There are a few scenes which were done purely to appall the audience but backfired as I dont find (SPOILER!!!) sexual acts with children and infants entertainment...just disgusting and without any type of artistic value. This movie had potential but in an effort to create an intense never before seen work of art they chucked out all vision and just went for pure depravity. Doesn't take creativity to think that up,just lack of! Save your money if you're looking for horror. If you're looking for porn, buy porn and if you're perverse in the worst way, well enjoy!!"
1,Another cut version is all we need,I bought this hoping it to be fully uncut but alas it's missing more than 90 seconds. The 2 most memorable scenes are heavily cut and especially the second scene doesn't make much sense anymore. I'm giving this one star because I feel cheated and because it just invites people to download the uncut version.There are 3 cut versions now of this movie on dvd and it's totally ridiculous.And on the movie page it says NC-17 while the dvd cover says Unrated. This is what liars do.Anyway I might've known that unrated doesn't mean uncut ...
3,Most deranged movie EVER,This is by far the craziest and most disgusting movie I have ever watched. It is so disturbing and I dont know how any could direct such a thing. If you are looking for most deranged movie ever made this is it
2,"Yeah,it's cut","Well,it misses over 4 minutes,which are probably the only interesting ones,given you buy this item for the gore.The movie itself is not that bad,but still somehow overlong and not really entertaining.It's worth a look though.Uncut running time is 99.24 minutes by the way."
1,pelicula es censurada,"pelicula es censurada, varias escenas esenciales que demuestran la glorioso de la historia de la pelicula fueron canceladas en esta version a pesar de que es unrated, mintieron en la clasificacion, mejor espere a que salga la verdadera version sin recortes (uncuted)y espere a ver los reviews antes de cometer el mismo error que yo"
2,A serbian film,"The movie was very fake, from what I heard about this movie I thought it was going to be very good, but it was not, again all thesex scene was very fake, you can see this on late night cable, so if you want to see a good movie, try The Image, The band, All about Anna, those was very good movies and the sex scene was real. So don't waste your money"
3,"a shocking, disgusting, and provoking film","WARNING: This DVD release won't be the full uncut version. Besides that, this movie will either appeal to you or won't. There likely won't be much in between. Hostel is a Disney movie compared to this. This is more along the lines of GUINEA PIG, but with more of a story."
1,WHY CENSORED?,"amazing movie but this is the censored version, i was lucky enough to get the uncensored version afterwards on another site and loved it, this is cut"
2,Overkill!,"This film is good if you enjoy the over the top oversaturated crazy stuff. I was expecting something disturbing and Artistic, what I got was a movie that seems to try so damn hard at being the sickest thing you've ever viewed that it just becomes totally void of any sort of provocative Art. A Serbian Film seems to not know if it wants to be Pier Paolo Pasolini's 'Salò, 120 Days of Sodom' or Pascal Laugier's 'Martyrs' and in the end it plays out like a wanna be Takashi Miike film that couldn't hold a candle to either of the two masterpieces I just named."
3,DANCES WITH WOLVES!,"THIS MOVIE CAUGHT ME OFF GUARD, I DIDN'T EXPECT THE VIOLENCETHAT WAS CREATED THROUGH OUT THE MOVIES STORY. DON'T SEE ITIF YOU HAVE A WEAK STOMACH."
4,Stop censorship...,"This movie is very rough. Give it a harder rating then, don't cut a movie to make it not what it was intended to be. Or make it safer for us. Give us a chance to decide for our selves' if we can handle it or not. I still Belive most people can think for there self. The uncut running time is 104 min."
1,NOT THE UNCUT VERSION,I am waiting for the uncut version to arrive somewhere in the world. The UK version has 49 censor cuts according to one seller on the internet.Censorship is an insult to our intelligence.
2,Fell Asleep,"Another movie that I purchased based on the hype, never again.While the movie is very graphic and deals with the very dark side of humanity, it's nothing original or really that shocking. Headlines on the 6 O'Clock News are more shocking.This movie takes taboos and basically exploits them for the sake of making a movie about the horrors people are capable of.If you like torture, forced drug addiction, rape, pedophilia, gore, necrophilia, porn and alcoholism, then this movie is for you to watch over and over."
2,A serious snoozefest with moments of poorly done BDSM,"Not sure why some regard this as shocking or the sickest movie ever made. It was a boring, tedious story for about the first 30 minutes, then things ramped up a bit and got absurd and confusing with poorly executed sexual fetish shots. It's just dumb simulated snuff-like stuff, I guess you'd call it. Save your money. The The Human Centipede is far more engrossing, interesting and disturbing than this useless film, and THC doesn't really show very much. If you really get off on BDSM, I'm sure you can find more interesting stuff online that's free. Actually, The Whistleblower with Rachel Weisz will probably better satisfy your craving for what you think The Serbian Film is about."
2,Meh.,"I didn't buy this product through Amazon.com, instead I downloaded the uncut version through an unliscensed movie download site. I really don't have much to say about the movie, except that it (shockingly!) isn't really shocking, provocative, or groundbreaking in any way. The whole film is just.. well... it's really not very good. It's an odd combination of hard-core porn, ""torture porn"", and recovered memory thriller somewhat in the vein of ""Memento"". If you want to see lots of fevered thrusting, engorged d***s, and a little bit of family suicide mixed in, go for it. If you're actually in the mood for a provocative film that is unsettlingly violent yet also has a deeper message, go for Martyrs.Martyrs"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS: IT IS THE CENSORED VERSION,Send a message to the spineless distributors that we won't accept censored movies. As if anyone who is ok with watching the cut version wouldn't also be ok with watching the uncut version... The ending of the cut version loses all its power. Just find the real version online somewhere.
1,Very Disturbing!,"I read this book after a recommendation from a friend, and now wished I'd saved myself the time and money. Nothing in the plot made since. The hero was this huge chauvinist pig who acted more like Francesca's pimp than her lover, and Francesca, the heroine was a lap dancer trapped in the body of a demure nineteenth century virgin. I can only say I came away feeling very disturbed by the undertones of female subjugation and overwheening male arrogance. The only interesting point in the whole book was the Aryan sub-plot to create a master race, intitiated by Francesca's childhood sweetheart and Aunts. I have to agree with all the other reviewers and say give this one a miss!"
1,Bad,"I read Thea Devine's Harlequin Temptation, ""Night Moves."" It was very good book. So, when I saw ""All I Desire"" at the library I decided to give it a try. One of the main characters, Reay, was a very weak character impersonating and exotic dancer to protect her cousin. Reay's aunts and favorite cousin were trying to impregnant women to start a new nation. He would perform this one by one in succession. Did they have Viagra in the 1800s? Secondly, there were some mysterious papers that were being searched for, but, Devine never explained what the papers were and their purpose.This book had the potential, in the beginning, to end with a great romance. But the ending was a flop.I will not allow this book to deter me from reading another one of her books."
1,Pass on this one,"I bought this book after reading several reviews of Thea Devine's other books. The sensuality came through, as promised, but I was disappointed by the complete lack of emotional connection between the two main characters. Love is never mentioned in this book; every encounter of the hero and heroine is driven by lust only. I don't consider the main character a hero; he is a complete control-freak who would rather die than admit to any mistake. The heroine is door mat material who never stands up for herself. At the conclusion of the story, the characters seem to stay together only due to their mutual passion for each other. Also, the whole plot is based on finding some mysterious ""papers"" which don't seem to have anything at all to do with the rest of the story. The conclusion is so far out of left field, I still don't know what was going on. I suggest you pass on this one unless you are a BIG Thea Devine fan."
1,I agree with all the readers above.,"I was disappointed with this book. I've read a lot of Thea Devine's book and I thouroughly enjoyed most of them but this one is just so unlike the author. It's so empty and it just makes you want to skip a lot of pages. I didn't really finished the book because i just can't warm up to the characters. It's such a shame because Ms Devine is really a great writer. For all the readers above, please don't judge the author by this one book. She's written really good books in the past and hopefully more good books in the future. I'm still a fan."
4,"Far fetched, but engaging","Unlike the other reviewers, I enjoyed it. Yes, I said it. Lighten up and read the novel for what it is - erotic entertainment."
3,"FARFETCHED, BUT ENTERTAINING","ALL I DESIRE brings a possible, yet unbelievable story to life. It's shrouded in mystery and unfolds slowy to come into a shattering focus. Old loves are not what they seem. Something sinister is going on. Who can one trust. The heroine, a virginal Francesca, takes on the role of her recently-deceased friend, Samara, an exotic dancer who made men swoon at her feet. But this deception brings Francesca confinement, humiliation, and betrayal. This book shows less erotic adventures than usual for Ms. Devine, a master of the erotic. It isn't her best work, yet I couldn't put it down until I saw how it ended. As always, this author's style twists and turns can't be anticipated."
1,Disapointed,As i have recently discovered Thea Devine in the book Captivated. This book left me hanging and a little confused about what happened. The romantic scenes were not what i expected in the theme of erotica and left me haning. But i will persist and try more books by Ms.Devine
1,Skip this one!,"This was my first book by Thea Devine. After going through this one, I have decided I will not be buying any more of her books. I use the term 'going thro' because I did not finish this novel.I love steamy erotic romances, there was nothing steamy or erotic about this one. Not even a fully developed lovemaking scene! To top it off, the plot was so tiresome and the lead characters so irritating, I had to restrain myself from throwing this book out of the window."
4,the plot is crazy but so what?,"The plot of this book is so strange, there's few people that can predict what can happen next. Though what happens is hardly believable, I was glad to be surprised at least. Yes the characters are unsympathetic, but who reads a Thea Devine novel for plot and characters? You read it for the steamy, often kinky scenes, and there's plenty to find in the pages of this book. I have read several forgettable romance books I quickly unload at the local used bookstore. This book I remember in pretty good detail, and for what it is I think the author delivers."
1,Highly Disappointed,"I was looking forward to reading this book, as I had never read any of Ms. Devine's books. I was very disappointed, and may not read any other books, if this is an indication of what to expect. I am a big fan of Robin Schone and Susan Johnson and was expecting much more. I have to agree with all of the other reviews. The characters were shallow and quite unbelievable."
1,All I Desired was a good book :o(,"This was my first book by Thea Devine and I'm not sure if I am going to read another one. I was so disappointed with the characters, the plot, everything!"
1,A novel without a story...what a concept!,"This sucks! (Literally)I have no clue why it was published! If they are going to sell sex with no story, they are better off marketing this book as erotica--NOT as romance!And sex is the only reason anyone would read this poor excuse for novel.Let me clarify that. Skanky, loveless, smutty sex--there's erotic, there's steamy, and then there's this mess! No characterization, no plot, no point. Just skim on over to the lust scenes (it would be ludicrous to call them love scenes) and get an eyeful. Then throw the book against the wall, like I did, and berate yourself for buying the book in the first place! This is the sort of book (and I use that term rather loosely here) that I wouldn't read for free!I hate books like this one--they cheapen the entire face of the romance genre!"
5,Gotta lovit!,"What can I say. I am anABBA fan. Powerful, uplifting music. Makes you want to get up and go!"
5,The Darkroom Bible,"This book is an absolute must-have for the experienced printer who wants to step up to the next level. The wealth of information he provides, from technical to historical, is extremely interesting, albeit a bit dizzying at times. However, the book can be used as a reference as needed for information on specific chemicals, formulas, or resources for supplies and equipment. Of all the books that I have read on printing, this is the one that has been most useful."
5,Essential for Every Darkroom,"This book is THE most essential piece of darkroom equipment. Before you buy your enlarger or sink, get this book. Not only does it contain evey formula you'll ever need, it has tips from contributing authors,conversion tables and much more. Steve Anchell has done a superb job organizing all this into a readable, easy to understand book. I give it my highest recommendation."
2,$33+ and no Table of Contents?!,"The book, of course, is outstanding. However the fact that an eBook that costs $33+ has no Table of Contents is absolutely inexcusable. Shame on you, Amazon."
3,Not What I was Hoping For,"I was hoping for a book that would explain the various effects of different ways of developing film, or the impact of different developers. For example, what is the impact of developing at higher temperatures and shorter times (or vice versa).... or what is the difference in results between different developers?The book centers more on how to mimic common developers by combining various chemicals and household products. A bottle of HC-110 is really quite cheap given how much film it could develop. A bottle of HC-110 (64 oz) costs $12.50 and has enough liquid to develop 256 rolls at Dillution H. That is less than 5 cents per roll. If I go through the effort to make my own, am I really going to save much money?"
2,It's not for me,"If you are a step by step learner don't buy this book also If you are not welling to spent hours daily to learn from it don't buy this book, its kind of book which requested by the teachers to there students."
3,Timex Expedition Metal Field,"good watch, keeps great time easy to read,,, indiglo portion of watch crapped out after a while , push the crown and nothing, only good during the day now."
2,date does not work,The time is ok but the date does not work. We have tried everything but it changes to the next day within hours. I purchased this watch as a gift for my husband and I am sorry I did. BB West.
4,great watch,"This is a great watch. I had one just like it before, except it was smaller, I guess a woman's size, but it was bigger than most woman's watches, so I was hoping this would be the same watch. But since it's too big for me, it works great for my husband."
5,Tiger Rice Dispenser,"This is an outstanding rice dispenser. Accurate rice measurment. Great blue color. I have purchased pink, blue, and gray rice dispensers. I am always satisfied with Tiger products."
4,Superb New Age Pagan Music!,"This is totally different from most Pagan cd's I have(ie:Laura Powers, Lisa Thiel). All the songs are superb with the exception of ""Medicine Song"" which I think is too rock n' roll sounding--almost 1980's style of music, and it seems out of place on this cd. I'd give this cd 5 stars if it weren't for that song."
4,Awesome,"I First heard this tape while in Salem Mass. and my mom bought it as a cassette. Ever since, It has been one of my all time favorites. My Favorite song is definetly Two Witches. Do yourself a favor and buy this CD"
2,not impressed,"Normally buy Ravensburger puzzles but wanted to try another brand and really liked the sailboats image. Sorry to say the quality of this puzzle is not what I expected. Based on reviews of this brand I expected sturdy, solid pieces that fit together well. However, the pieces are a bit thin and oddly shaped. Many were stuck together, which is normal, but they don't snap apart easily. They aren't cut through completely so that when pulling them apart I had to be careful not to rip the backing. Pulling apart also left some jagged edges making for an awkward fit. Anyhoo, I think I'll stick with Ravensburger."
1,Broken 3 times!!!!,"I bought this clock and it came broken. I sent it back and the next one came broken. Sent that one back and that came broken!!! They package a ceramic clock with one piece of brown paper in the box and that was it! i called customer service because I still wanted the clock, but she could not guarantee that they would package it correctly so I said forget it!! Extremely disappointed!! If the review came with a zero star instead of one star I would have rated it that way!!!!!!!!! DON'T BUY THIS!!!!!"
3,"Pretty, but does it work?","Very attractive design. Can't trust the themometer and the clock work is a standard cheap quartz movement. Place this piece out of the way as the hands ride a good inch above the body and are easily snagged and bent.As a clock and thermometer, it deserves less than 1 star. I gave it three stars because it is pretty."
1,Be Advised - Item does not reflect picture - arrived broken,"I read the reviews before purchasing this item, and I regret not acknowledging the majority of the advise...what can I say, I was hopeful.Aside from the fact that this item arrived broken, as did others who have left reviews, It is truly nothing like the picture. It does not have beautiful delicate ivy hinged with purple flowers and sweet purple dragonflys with black numbering. Instead it is a nasty brown cluttered mess, with 3 types of greenery and hideous brown bugeyed dragonflys and brown numbers. I posted a picture under customer images for this product to show the difference.Needless to say, I was extremely disapointed and found the picture very missleading, but I have learned my lesson :) Hope this helps anyone."
1,Lemon.,I bought this clock/thermometer for my new house it was broken almost in half . I have received my replacement and the thermometer hasn't been off 80. It doesn't work either. I am returning it and am afraid to try again. I had a clock just like it which lasted about 10 years before the thermometer wore out. Please refund my money or send me a new one that works. Sue McShayL
3,outdoor clock and thermometer,"the item was purchased as a gift for my wife, and she likes it.it is a bit heavy (7 lbs) for hanging on the house aluminum siding.the first one shipped was poorly packaged and it broke in two.the second one shipped was poorly packaged and two of the three light gage spinner dial needles were badly bent. I straightened them and hope they last a few years; I made note of that in a post-purchase correspondence with Amazon but heard no more.The replacement of the busted original was done very expeditiously, good work on that."
3,An unfortunate number of errors.,"I just started my first Verilog project, need to come up to speed quickly, and assumed this book would be a good help. I like the format, the layout, and the general treatment. However, my initial skim of the first fifteen pages shows a grammatical howler and (I think) a technical error. That's unfortunate in that, whenever I come to something I don't understand later in the book, I'll never be quite sure whether I'm being dumb or there's an error. That detracts from the book's value to me quite a bit.In a $35 book, that level of proofreading would be unfortunate. In a $170 book it's unforgivable."
5,I wish the alphabet had more letters!,"David Schwartz is brilliant! In G is for Googol, he brings together a wealth of mathematical information for strong independent readers. A is for abacus, F is for Fibonacci, and K is for Konigsburg! If you don't know how to pronounce rhombicosidodecahedron, don't dispair! Schwartz will show you how, and his entertaining and informative book will keep inquisitive kids enthralled for hours!"
1,"Crescent 23"" kids toy acoustuc guitar - don't waste your $$","This was a disappointment! Purchased this guitar for my son and was very unhappy with it. It is not a ""playable"" instrument as is suggested in the description. You cannot tune it or tighten the strings because they do not function. No accessories included (at least with mine)."
4,My son LOVES this guitar,"He plays it constantly and I love his ""concerts"". But you must screw the strings tight before use (as many other reviewers noted). And, no, you are not going to get a perfectly tuned sound. But to see the smile on my son's face while he plays (and his little borther watching) makes it wort it."
2,It is only a toy,"I bought this for my son for Christmas a few years ago. I should have realized that a $20 guitar would not hold a tune. He had fun with it. He snapped the neck, but it glued together fine. Just know that it is just a toy and don't expect it to sound like a real guitar."
1,Don't Say You Haven't Been Warned...,The day the guitar arrived is the day that it broke. Don't do it! It's not worth the time and disappointment on your little one's face.
3,"Sell the Sizzle, Not the Steak!","In the 1960s, before the boom of hard-core pornography, there was a big market for soft-core. Sell The Sizzle, Not The Steak! was the mantra of soft-core. HUNG is all sizzle and no steak. The author is a very talented writer, but he seems to be gagging on his own politics. In the world of Scott Poulson-Bryant, if you don't like black men you are a racist. If you do like black men you are a racist (or at best an eracist) since you only like them because they are black. And that damned if you do, damned if you don't way of thinking seems to permeate much of his writing. He even delves into what I call the Politics of Perception: if a black man takes photographs of black men, it's art. If a white man takes photographs of black men, it's exploitation (or as the author puts it, a cultural violation). It's all about the black and the white. Grey does not exist in the world of Scott Poulson-Bryant, but I guess that is life on the Color Line."
1,Within 2 pages you know why this book was written,There isn't anything to say really about this book. I knew after reading a couple of pages what this book was about. It was an interesting topic but not a lot of anything in it. Just to let folk know something.... every black man is not packing and the saying size doesn't matter is a big fat lie to protect the smaller sized men that need their ego's babied a little bit. However sex isn't everything. It won't get you what really matters in life anyway. I wouldn't rush to get this book though.
3,"Apologies Aside, Everyone Should Read This Book","I'm Cacausian, so let's get the race addressed first,because it might be a race issue: Cacausian men believing that African-American men, are all hung,and maybe, some believing that they should be. That is how I read into it, whether that is the author's viewpoint or not. The book, actually, is for all men, straight or [...], who are worried that they may not measure up per other men. It is an insightful book, meant to be read carefully."
4,"HUE Womens Patchwork Crochet Shue, Port, Large","These pair of slippers are comfy, I can hardly take these off."
4,Excellent Album,"I thoroughly enjoyed listening to this album. Good arrangements, well performed. I would recommend this album to all fans of Bowie and also to those not as familiar with his tunes. Bowies' music sounds amazing whether played on delicate violins or rocking out with guitars. Well worth it!"
2,loose end cap,I received this item and it is what I was looking for but the end cap needed repair before I could wear it. It had come loose.
1,Ewww! I hate it! The worse!,"I bought this, thinking it was ""I spit on your grave"", and when I watched it, it was sooooo horrible. You could tell it was like shot by a low budget Canadian film crew or something. The uhm, killer, is quit hilarious. And the way he is, ""killed"", is worth seeing. Only watch it if you score it for like a dollar!"
3,"Nice, a little sedate","I enjoy German as a second language from college, and was yearning to hear holiday carols. Not so easy to find in the US. This CD is OK, but pretty sedate - it is, after all, the vienna boys choir, sort of the ""mormon tabernacle choir"" of europe. don't expect a pulse-racing version of anything. But it's ok."
4,Really liked it,I really enjoyed this book. The idea of heynim that will swarm around people's heads is very creative. It is not like any other book I have ever read. I thought Tamborel was a very devoloped character but Caidy was a little less so. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes fantasy but especially someone around my age. (13 years old)
1,"full pay, short fill","Why would a sheet of polycarbonate advertised to be 12"" x 12"" end up being delivered as 11-3/4"" x 11-3/4""? This sheet is 1/16"" thick. No saw or blade will consume 1/4"" from each dimension for this thickness of material. Measurements are a complete misrepresentation, and this misrepresentation is doubly intentional: you short-cut the original material, then you bait and switched when filling the order. The only people who purchase in these sizes and quantities are those working on projects where dimensions matter. I would be concerned about trimming if too much material was provided, and thankful for the opportunity, but what am I supposed to do with too small a piece? There is no market standard that makes this misrepresentation, this theft, tolerable. Hey, you're my first negative review! I hope you felt it was worth it!"
5,using it for subwoofer box,"using it for subwoofer window on a box, strong material, very nice clear and quick shipping. I recommend this product even thought from 1/2 thick to 3/4 price jump is huge.."
2,"Polycarbonate Sheet, ASTM D 3935, Clear, 1/4"" Thick, 12"" Width, 24"" Length","I ordered a 1/4in. sheet of Polycarbonate 12in. wide by 24in. long. Instead I received a sheet 1/4in. thick 11 3/4in. wide by 23 3/4in. long. What are we doing, measuring everthing by lumber dimensions now?"
2,"Not really 12""","The polycarbonate itself is good. I've bought the same polycarbonate from another seller. However, from this seller you're not actually getting 12x12 sheets, but 11.75 x 11.75. This is bad news if, like me, you need to make parts that are 12"" and are planning on trimming it to size. Other sellers sell the product at about 12.125 x 12.125. My rating is for them selling a smaller size than what is listed."
3,"Nice plastic, not sized accurately","As other reviewers have mentioned, this is a great product, but it's not the size that's claimed. The 12x24 sheet is actually 11.75x23.75. Good information to have before ordering! Other than the inaccurate description, it's great."
1,Promising idea - very poor execution,"I am very sorry to have to say that this is quite the worst book I have ever read.I was very attracted by the idea of a Veterinarian in the Wild West thinking it would be very interesting and unusual (sort of James Herriott with Colt Revolvers). However, it isn't - it is a rather routine Western and not a good example of one of those eitherDescrpitive writing and characterisation are poor and there is little or no sense of period and not much of place. Do not waste your time on this book"
2,Nail Capsules,Didn't see much difference in my nails after one month. Plus you have to take 6 a day! Not really what I want to do. Very expensive too! Disappointing.
2,Results pending,"I have gone through one and a half bottles and have not noticed any difference in my hair growth. I bought two more bottles to give it some time. I take the recommended dosage daily. If I still do not see a change after these two bottles, I will discontinue use."
4,Good Flick...,"I really enjoyed this movie. If your into stoner movies that take place in the 70s like Dazed and Confused, Detroit Rock City etc... you should check this out. Yes this takes place in the late 70s, not the 80s like some other reviewers said. I wouldn't say it's better than Dazed and Confused, but it has more laughs. Dazed and Confused is more of a comedy/drama. Where as this movie is a straight comedy. Definitely check it out..."
1,better than D. & C. ?,"""Better than ""Dazed and Confused""!"" according to the blurb on the dvd case when I ran across this movie in the store, so I took a chance. Sorry,wrong. D. & C. is one of the best films of its genre (teen angst flicks). The problem with this film is every single character is so obnoxious, there's no one to identify with, making it impossible to care what happens to anyone. Avoid at all costs."
1,Worst flick ever,"I had heard of this movie for years, and when it came on cable, I decided to watch it. Biggest waste of time. No plot, crappy acting, and little to no pot smoking in the entire movie. Go stare at a wall, and you will be more entertained than watching this P.O.S."
1,Stoned Age,"This movie is stupid and lame! Bad acting, bad script, BAD MOVIE! Not worth the money to buy."
4,funny as hell,"This movie is great!! joe and hubs have a wild and crazy night, and party with some rad chicks."
4,Great,"Absolutely classic movie. Ive seen this movie so many times, i just about have the entire thing memorized. There are many unforgettable moments and great one liners you'll be using for years."
2,If there is nothing else to watch at 2:00am go for it.,"This movie was just entertaining enough to watch if you are into beer, women, and bad acting. The basic plot is guys find girls; drink beer; have a few acid flash backs; and get into fights. The best part of the movie was the soundtrack."
1,This is worse than Annie,This has to be one of the worst movies ever made. The acting is terribale. The costumes are a joke. The social interaction is fake. I wasted 2 good hours of my life hoping that this movie was anything like Dazed and Confused. The sound track was the best part and It wasn't even that great. If you want to eat away an evening get this movie just to make fun of it.
1,DVD did not work,I had two different DVD'S of this movie sent to me and they both did not work. I have an APEX DVD Player and I can't believe that this didn't work. Be aware.
1,"horrible, absolutely horrible","thank GOD i watched this movie online using netflix and didnt have to pay for it! absolutely horrible. of course i was thinking that it would be somewhere along the lines of Dazed and Confused, or that 70's show, but alas, just another awful movie about nothing at all. i mean, dont get me wrong, i love stupid movie, eg dude wheres my car, that was fantastic, a stupid plot, with mainstream stoner dialogue paneled together to create and interesting mean and ending. the stoned age however is unable to grasp the concept of ""stupid movie"" with excellent humor and ending. there were some funny parts in the movie, however it was not enough to make me want to watch it again. i give it an F."
2,Not very cool....,"When a friend told me to check out this movie, i was under the impression that it was a good ol' stoner comedy. It turns out it's just about two broke ass losers who need to get laid. The plot is terrible, even for a ""stoner"" Flick! This makes Half Baked's dialouge look genius! All these guys do is sit around and b*tch & complain. This is just an overall crappy movie. I can't believe the cover of the movie says ""Better Than Dazed and Confused""....yeah f***ing right!! Watch this is you need something to fall asleep to. Peace"
1,"Booo, Won't Play!","Don't buy this expecting to play it on a computer. I've tried on 4 computers and it won't play in ANY DVD-ROM's. It worked fine on two tv DVD units, but no go on the computer."
1,It's hard to believe,"It boggles the mind that anyone could possibly like this movie. Don't get me wrong -- I appreciate idiotic comedies as much as the next guy. But this movie had no redeeming qualities whatsoever. I'd rather get hit repeatedly with a hammer than sit through this poorly made, poorly acted flick that has no likable characters and terrible dialogue. Looking for a stoner movie? Dazed/Confused, Half-Baked, any Cheech and Chong, Outside Providence... any of these looks like Citizen Kane next to this trash. Spare yourself. Do not buy this. Or give it as a gift."
4,If you liked the 70's ....you'll lile this,"Having grown up in the 70's in So. Calif., this was like a flashback to the good old days. My first concert was Blue Oyster Cult and I owned a V W. Squareback so this movie was a scene out of my adolescence. Especially loved the scene with Buck and Eric after the credits."
2,"Great movie, crappy copy",Stoned Age is a hilarious cult movie. If you were teen-aged in the '60s and '70s you really laugh a lot. Anyone else-- you'll still get a buzz from this flick. HOPEFULLY YOU'LL GET A GOOD COPY OF THE DVD- MINE WAS DISAPPOINTINGLY DEFICIENT IN QUALITY.
5,Jump on the grenade,"This is like deja vu all over again... It is a classic / fun movie that makes me re-live my high school days. It has great music with BOC, Nugent, Foghat, Sabbath, and the others that we listened to while we were out looking for chicks - and what ever else... It also has some nice T & A with Laney, but China Katner is the real girl that you wish your never passed up. Joe, please jump on that grenade!!!! Watch until the very end credits to see Buck Darhma and Eric Bloom from BOC try to sell Joe and Hubbs a shirt. Don't fear the reaper is one of my fav songs of all time - so this movie is always at the front of my ones to watch when I need to relax. Get your buddies together and watch The Stoned Age together with Dazed and Confused and you will have to jump in the car and go cruising for chicks!"
3,The Stoned Age,I rented this movie from Blockbuster for one reason only. That reason was on the cover it states that it's better than Dazed and Confused. I think that might be one of the best movies I'd ever seen. The Stoned Age story line didn't have me watching the movie till I couldn't pay the electric bill (others have) All in all if you like 70's movies you'll like it. If you like good 70's movies you won't.
3,The Stoned Age,Overall a worth while movie to watchbut not as good as Dazed and Confused or Fast Times at Ridgemont High
