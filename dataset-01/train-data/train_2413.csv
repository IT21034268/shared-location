3,Doris Grumbach has worked wonders with this book!,"The book ""Chamber Music"" was very touching. It takes one back into the life of Caroline Maclaren as she tells her story of the most important people to her, throughout her whole entire life.She tells of the the life behind marrying a composer who puts everything into music, and cares nothing of his surroundings. Later in her years, she has learned to love someone unexpectedlyl. The later years in her life, were the happiest yet, because she has learned to love someone, and that someone wasn't her husband, the composer, but a companion and friend she has made through caring for her husband before he died.Doris Grumbach has worked wonders with this book. Her writing is very strong and caring. She wrote with feelings as if her, herself, was in the body of Caroline Maclaren. This book is worth it! It will shock you and touch your heart at the same time!"
2,$50 for a book printed in China?,"Wow, $50 for a book printed in China? I'll wait 'till it goes on sale @ Walmart or one of those places."
5,One of my favorite pair...,"Love these Ninas. Everytime I wear them, I wow someone and they just cannot believe the price I bought them!!!! Thanks Amazon, is the best I can say..."
2,"""Slightly Amusing"" Man...","After a solid opening scene, followed by a promising set-up, ""Funny Man"" loses all it's steam with a series of unimaginative murders, surreal settings, and only moderately amusing jokes from the titular character at the expense of his victims. This British answer to Freddy Kruger lacks any suspense, irony, or wit as it seems to be an excuse for whacking a buch of mostly undesireable characters. The ending is somewhat flat, and at this point I felt no vested interest in neither victim nor killer. Not even my appreciation of English humour could really keep my interest. As a huge fan of the macabre, this one really dissapointed me."
2,funny man is not so funny after all!!!,Funny man is an ok way to kill 2 hours. my eyes were not at all glued to the screen. the dvd is packed with extras wich are great if you are a fan of the movie.By all means i say give this A RENT and if you like buy it.
4,Very cool,The Bully Oval Blue LED Hitch Brake light is very cool. Super easy to install. It's made of plastic and you have to put a few peaces together and then screw them in. Then slide it in the hitch receiver and lock in place with your hitch pin. I may recommend a locking on so someone does not run off with it. Then plug it into your trailer light plug and it works! Nice cool blue when your lights are on and a nice bright red when you put on your breaks or hazards. Not sure how long it will last. The plastic feels like it would break easy but time will tell. Been on the truck for two weeks with no problems so far.
3,Great look but seems to accumulate water in it.,"Looks great on my F350 dually, but it does seem to accumulate water in the housing. The water has not shorted anything out but it does fog up the lense. I ended up drilling a drainage hole in the bottom which has helped to a degree."
3,OK for the price,Bought as gift for someone. Overall not a bad product & does what it says it does. Gave it three stars because there is too much plastic in the design.
5,Great Add-on,"Some simple assembly needed - very simple with a screwdriver. The cushion pad was very stiff requiring to push the assembly pretty hard into the receiver enough to put in the pin, but this ensures a snug rattle free install. Have had it in place for many bouts of severe wet weather and works perfectly. Looks REALLY good."
1,Be careful,"Well in my state blue lights are illegal which I found out after ordering, like I need a stater pulling me over which happened to a friend who had the same hitch cover. They have a push button test you can see through the clear package, looks cheesy to me anyway, I returned it the beauty of Amazon."
5,Great looking hitch cover,"This hitch cover lights a nice blue color when your lights are on and red when you hit the brake. It sticks out a little more than other covers and I didn't like it at first because of it sticking out but now I love it. It comes with adapters for 2 different size receivers, 1 1/4"" and 2"". I am very please with it. I had got a great deal on it here at Amazon."
1,Not Happy,"The reason I'm not happy is because I installed this product and two days later it stopped working. I have to say that while it worked it was cool, if it would have lasted it would have been great. Oh well? Mr Electric"
2,Does not work on my vehicle,"I have a '11 Ford Flex. I tried twice to get this product to work and it failed both times. First time, after I installed it, it worked as advertised: nice blue Ford logo switched to red oval when you pressed the brake. But after the first test, the blue light quit working. I sent it back and got a replacement. Again, at first it worked properly but then both blue and red lights quit. I sent it back and bought something else. I do not know if it was 2 defective lights or it just didn't work on my vehicle."
1,Not legal,I guess I did not read the complete description of this product. After receiving the item and installing was given a fix it ticket (meaning to remove it) as it is not legal to have a blue lighted item on a vehicle.
4,Brake Light,"It works as advertised, brighter than I thought - just make sure you have the correct plug-in or buy the adapter."
4,Cool product but they break easily.,"This LED hitch attachment is a good safetly devise as it lights up a spot that is not usually lit and changes from blue to red when you hit the brakes so it draws the attention of the car behind you. However it sticks out a good 1 1/2 inches from the rear of my Ford Ranger so if I park in a tight spot I run the risk of it hitting the fender of the car behind me. It is only made of plastic and breaks easily. This is my second one. When it breaks, and sooner or later it will, I probably will not get a third. If you're a better parker than me this may not be an issue for you, nor is it an issue on a larger vehicle such as an F-150 or Explorer where it does not stick out further than the rear of the truck.UPDATE 6/12/2012. I have bought a third one, i liked them so much and this one has lasted a year. Perhaps my parking skills have improved!"
4,C@ Corvette DVD,Great video about the history of the C2. Too much emphasis on C1 and C3 for the limited time but worth the few bucks.
4,Reasonably good.,"I guess the weakness of this product is that it listens to ALL infrared traffic, so if you try to use it in default mode it will beep at you every time you change the volume on your TV. I needed to activate the mode where a specific little-used command was used for on/off, and now (2 days in) it seems like it works.I would have preferred a multi-position switch for training then operating, so I'm afraid the current long-burst method of entering training mode will come back to haunt me, but it is doing the job I need done and the price through Amazon is a lot cheaper than going straight to Koolatron so I'm OK with the deal so far. And since it has an on/off button on top, it can be a manual switch in an emergency, like if it forgets the programming.Too bad there isn't more competition in this market though. That'd encourage more user-friendly programming..."
5,TJ & Big earl,"As a family we would play this back in 91. Moved around in the military and it got lost, just found this one and we love it all over again! Thanks!"
1,And a great series comes to a sad end,"What happened! ToeJam and Earl was an awesome series then this POS came out and totally shot the series to death with cheesey looking characters. The new female character is a stupid joke, a true Toejam and Earl fan would wanna play Lewanda or maybe Sharla instead, or heck even Peabo would be awesome. This game should be banned from the Xbox library it is seriously that bad! The game for one thing is totally pointless, and the gameplay sucks, and the graphics aren't much better than N64 or playstation, maybe worse. Its a bad game that really taints an excellent and unique video game series and also a good system."
2,Ho Hum.,"The idea of this game is to go around and collect funk records. Yup, that's about it. The game is simplistic and, although it does have some nice graphical effects, it is, overall, rather bland (and the funky music gets old rather fast). With that said, the game should keep the younger crowd occupied for a while, though. Although I would rate the game on the lower end of a Teen rating (i.e., closer to an E), I fail to understand why Sega would create a game obviously intended for the 10 and under crowd, and then put elements in it that give it a Teen rating. In this case, it is the standard ""comic mischief"" and some wiggling."
4,TOE JAM AND EARL ARE BACK!!!,"what you've been hearing about is true.....on the 25th of ths month...they return.Thats right toejam and earl are back with a brand new mission. you may be intrested why im so excited about this game and the reaosn is this, when i was little my brother and me would always play the game and its finnally back after too many years of sleeping. The original concept for the game is simple....walk around worlds and get presents and things to open up an elevator to the next world while truying to find pieces to your ship. this game is veryyy fun....esspecially with multiplayer...my faverite lol. So i gurrentee you'll like this game...esspecially if your a fan of the first ones..(theres 2) this game comes out the 25 of october go get it right away!!!!"
4,It's back,"I only gave this game 4 stars since I havent played it yet, but after hearinf it was being based on the original I know it will be at least 4 stars and 5+ for all the Toejam and Earl fans out there. The original still remains as my favorit video game ever and is the only reason I still have my genesis. X-box owners should be grateful Microsoft got the rights to this game, for anyone who has played the originals it is a must have and for anyone who has never played it before it is a definate muyst rent. I have never pre-ordered a game before because in this day and age who knows if it will be worth it. But I pre-ordered this the moment it was announced. 4 more days...."
1,the worst game ever made,this game should be for 3 year olds it's so easy. this game is so annoying all they say is funkify its so stupid. they're just these stupid annoying rappers
1,terrible,if anyone wants this game let me know! because this is the [dummmist] game ive ever played! actually i dont want to give this to any one because they would be pissed at me for life. this is the only review i ever wrote but i just had to warn people dont buy rent or give anyone this!
3,"A little bit tame, but still a good comedy album","This is more of a Radio Musical, than a real Stand-Up comedy album. Still it stars Jack E. Leonard, the original master of the insult. While Don Rickles took it to an entire new level in the late 1960's, Leonard had the same idea and in this musical, we get a bunch of situations of when it would be a proper time to insult somebody that is getting on your nerves. From your boss, to your wife, to just the everyday person you might happen to meet. Leonard insults them all with basic insulting humor, which might even be considered ""cheesy"" to some. However, for me, it was funny.I didn't even know who Jack E. Leonard was until my father told me about him. This album really isn't that outstanding, but if you like old style ""Jackie Gleason"" type humor, with a twist of ""insult comedy"" - then this album might be what you are looking for."
5,The only atlas you will ever need,"Best book that I own, covers every gyn surgery that you will ever THINK of doing. Descriptions of the procedures even give you tips on appropriate suture to use and technique. Cadaveric dissections and illustrations are excellent. First heard about the book after I went to a conference hosted by the authors and they put a great effort into making this book. Is well worth the price."
2,Outstanding book,Every surgeon that works in pelvic region must have this book.Excellent book for beginners in pelvic surgery
5,Slug Magic by Bonide works great !!,"I have a small raised garden ringed with a slug nursery created by previous owner when he used hollow concrete blocks topped with patio slabs. This year the slugs attacked everything, including rhubarb! I vowed to find a solution and luckily found Bonide Slug Magic which is environmentally friendly and at the same time very effective. I removed all the patio caps and poured a trail of SM pellets inside each cement block and above ground next to my rhubarb. That was 2 weeks ago and when I check now, all that remains are some moldy white spots that used to be slugs! My Swiss Chard and Rhubarb leaves are growing in with no bite marks/holes.I am now a loyal customer of Bonide SlugMagic."
4,"Loved this iron, only one fault","This iron glides so smoothly more than any iron I've ever used. I do a lot of quilting and it works beautifully. The only fault I see is the cord placement, where it goes into the iron. It's smack in the spot when you go to set the iron upright on the ironing board. I looked at my old iron and this cord, is placed off to the right or left side. The Rowenta is in the middle and I hit that everytime I place the iron in upright or rest position. It takes a fair amount of water but that's not a problem for me. Would have given it a 5 star if not for the cord in my way."
4,great iron,I really love this iron although when I got it the box says DX1700 but the iron say DX1600. I would have sent it back except I was desperate as my old Rowenta had gone to the iron heaven after 8 years of hard labor. I really hope this iron lasts as long as I have had more irons over my 48 years of marriage till I got my first Rowenta. They are great irons.
2,leaks and eventually stops working,"I am on my second effective iron. They both leak after awhile, and I believe that leads to it to stop working properly. It goes into sleep or auto-shutoff mode while using it, and I have to shake the daylights out of it to get it to come back on for a short time, only to go back off once it heats up. I exchanged the first one for the second one, and now I need to get something new and reliable since I iron quite a bit. Forgot to mention, the steam burst button stopped working some time ago (my fave feature). Otherwise, its great the first few months until the leaking starts!"
2,Great for a Little While,"This particular Effective by Rowenta was my third Rowenta iron purchase in five years. I love how the Rowenta irons: fabulous steam, lots of pressure when you press the steam button, stainless steel soleplate that is silky and heavy (takes less time to press, the heavier the iron). Lots of good things to say about the Rowenta in use.Except one thing: for my use (2-3 times a week), a Rowenta iron just doesn't last. Three $60-ish irons in five years? You get NO inclination that it's going on the fritz, except, one time, you'll need to iron something, you'll plug it in, and it won't heat up.I treat my irons with great respect, as these babies cost double what a cheapie iron costs. But today was the last straw. No more Rowenta irons for me. I'm going with a cheapie with a great rating. Looks like a Panasonic for me."
1,Avoid it,"We are returning our second one in a week. Right out of the box,the first one didn't hold water, whatever you poured in at the top, ran right back out. OK, obvious manufacturing defect, very annoying but it can happen. The 2nd one didn't leak after pouring the water and for good measure we let it sit for 24h. However, we just finished ironing with it for the first time and it drips constantly over the clothes.That will be the end of our Rowenta experience."
2,Worst iron I have ever had!,"This is the second Rowenta iron that has disappointed me. Within a year I bought two and both don't steam properly. I fill the iron with water, plug it in and the light goes one. It heats for a while and then turns off suddenly and leaks on my garment. No steam comes out for proper ironing. Either I bought a defective one or this is the inherent pattern of the iron. I will not buy one again."
2,This iron stinks.,"I purchased this item at Kohls to replace my $100 rowenta that I bought 5 yrs. ago and I was majorly disappointed. I returned it after one use. First, the steam lever did not stay on Auto like it's supposed to. That's not a ""nuisance"" like some reviewers have noted; the product is defective and you should return it if you still can. My mom has one and hers stays in place like it's supposed to. I noticed that this iron is made in China and my old Rowenta was made in Germany, so there you go. Second, there is no ""door"" to close when you put the water in so it can drip all over your clothes. I have been using Rowentas for about 20 years now and I must say, the quality has gone downhill. I guess they make the lower-priced irons in China now, so if you want to get a Rowenta and expect high performance be sure it's still made in Germany and expect to pay close to $100. I'm going to try a Panasonic and see what happens. Rowentas seem to have gone downhill."
2,Very Disappointed,"I had always heard that Rowenta irons were very good. I didn't buy the most expensive, but I still had good expectations. I'll take my old Black & Decker iron any day! The Rowenta doesn't get hot enough to iron out any wrinkles on any fabric unless it is on the hottest temp, and then you have to keep nudging the temp control to keep it from cutting off."
2,Rowenta steam iron,The iron did not achieve a high enough temperature and requires constant fill-up of water to maintain steam.
3,Irritating Steam/Dry Switch,"I've been using this iron for about a year and it is still ironing fine. I use bottled water, as recommended if you have a water treatment system which uses salt - I wonder if the people who complain about brown water leaking did this? But my complaint is that the slide control which switches between dry, steam and self-clean keeps popping out of steam back to dry, and if you're like me and are thinking about other things while ironing this is really annoying because you suddenly realise you're not getting steam and haven't been for at least half a shirt then see that the control has slipped to dry, again! I checked and, yes, mine was made in China too."
2,short life span,"i loved this iron, great great great, after a year 1/2 of moderate use it has stopped heating. so now i am stuck to purchase a new one or send it to NY to have it repaired. i just thought it would last a bit longer. i am sad."
5,Great iron Great price!,"I have never had a bad experience with Rowenta. And you cant beat the price of this one. Yes you can get a cheaper iron, but it wouldnt be the same quality."
1,Leaks Water,"This iron leaks water. First it was just on occasion. After about 2-3 months, it is now constant from the base of the iron, and I have to go buy a new iron. Don't buy it!"
5,Decreased My Cleaners Bill,"I absolutely love my ROWENTA! I have decreased my cleaners bill dramatically!My work shirts, hubbys work shirts and pants, are so crisp and clean with this iron. We absolutely love it! It doesn't leak like other reviews I've read.The steam option is incredible for extremely wrinkled jeans and hard to press drapes.Overall it's a wonderful iron. Takes no time at all to have your clothes ideally pressed."
2,Great... until it stopped working.,"Very disappointing. My only complaint at first was that my fingers sometimes brushed against and moved the setting dial but that was tolerable. Shortly after the warranty expired (of course), the iron stopped working. Like others who have left reviews, the auto shut-off began to shut the iron off randomly, and now it doesn't heat up at all. I'll try my luck with something other than a Rowenta."
2,Does Not Live Up to Its Brand Name,"I bought this iron at Bed, Bath & Beyond...assuming that because it was Rowenta it would certainly be a decent iron. It is fine, but it certainly does live up to my memories of using the iron we had at home growing up...which I am sure was not fancy. The iron just worked, and worked fine.This Rowenta iron is just odd...sometimes it creates good steam and sometimes it doesn't. Sometimes it drips and sometimes it doesn't. The self-clean mechanism doesn't seem like it does much. The iron continuously collects grime on its soleplate even though I don't really use it often or on too hot of a setting or with starch, etc.Luckily I think Bed, Bath & Beyond has a good return policy...so I think I might just try my hand at returning it tonight ordering a highly-reviewed one off of Amazon.com."
2,great when it works!!!,"This is my second Rowenta iron. I do not think I will purchase any more. When it works it does a wonderful job. But, about 6 months into ownership it stops emitting steam. You have to shake it, unplug it and then it will start up again. Now, today it lights up but no heat. These use to be quality products, but something has changed in the design or ownership and they are sub par."
4,works well,I have had Rowenta irons for many years. I found this model to work well and it produces a good amount of steam. This is the first time I have purchased one of the less expensive models and I am pleased with it. The more expensive Rowenta models are heavier and produce more steam but this one provides a good value for the price.
2,Great if you like damp clothes,"I'm returning my third Rowenta DX1700 in the past two weeks. All of the models that I've purchased have worked fine - lots of steam, smooth ironing - except for one problem: All of them drool water in addition to steam. This means that my white shirts end up with water stains, which means that they have to be washed again. And this is from brand new irons! I can't imagine how well this iron will work after a couple of years.From reading the reviews of this iron, it seems that the quality is something of a crapshoot -- some of them have been exceedingly well built, making their owners very happy, while others are not built as well. The ones I purchased are in the latter group, which is why I can't give this iron a good rating."
1,Horrible company,"I had the iron for a year and the electrical system started shorting out. I brought the issue to Rowenta support, who told me to stop using the item because it was dangerous. Since it was a few months out of warranty they would only give me $5 towards another one of their irons. If Rowenta can't guarantee an iron to work for more than a year, you shouldn't invest any money into their products unless you're okay with that."
2,Rowenta DX1700 Just OK,"The old black & decker iron I was replacing was just as good. The Rowenta irons just fine, but is way too heavy and you have to add water way too often. Really a hassle to stop ironing and add more water."
1,HATED IT FROM DAY ONE!!!,"I didn't like this iron first time I used it, but thought I should give it more of a chance. I absolutely hated it the whole time I've owned it. First problem, I couldn't get it to stay on steam. I finally taped the lever to the on steam position. Second, it automatically turns off right before you will use it again if you are doing a sewing project... pain in the butt! I found it to be unstable on my ironing board... fell off a number of times, partly because of the base of the cord and possibly my board's problem. It just fell off the board for the LAST TIME! Going out to buy a PANASONIC Iron and a new board!!! The only good thing about the iron is the stainless steel plate, glides over the fabric wonderfully."
1,Worst Iron ever,"This iron worked well for the first 1-2 months and just as the window to return it ended it stopped working. It was permanently stuck on the auto shut off. I paid to have it shipped to the service center and they fixed it and sent it back after a month.Now its leaking water and is shutting off again. You would think that a Rowenta iron would be a quality product, I guess not"
2,disappointed...,"I bought the Rowenta Effective DX 1700 from Bed Bath & Beyond (they had an offer with $10 off), about an year ago. At first, it seemed to work very well, and I loved the way the ironing plate sled over the clothes. But, in less than 6 months, the iron heated up only immediately after plugged in, and maintained a much lower temperature shortly thereafter; in addition to this, using it mostly for cotton, there is no steam whatsoever coming out.... Very disappointed..."
2,Problem with water leaking,"Like the iron, but had to return it after 2 months because when you put water into it and begin to iron, water would leak out onto the clothes amd onto the ironing board. Thanks to Amazon for taking it back after the return period expired."
3,"Great Iron, But Auto-Off SUCKS","Good price, well built, works out wrinkles very well... but WTF is wrong with the Auto-Off feature? It simply doesn't work on my iron and it's only a few weeks old. I know it's a good habit to unplug the iron after finishing up, but sometimes people forget. I've returned to my ironing board many hours later to find the iron still on. The body was really hot and could pose some real danger. This problem seems to be affecting most of the users on here."
3,Love-Hate This Iron,"This is the third Rowenta Effective Iron I buy. The first one lasted all of 20 months. I loved the way it ironed and hated to be without it, so thinking I must have hit a lemon I bought a replacement. The second one didn't even make it 15 months. When it works, this iron is the best iron I have ever used. It is light weight and makes ironing a dream. The down side is the cheap auto shut off has a very short working life. First it gets finicky and then before you know it, it goes belly up, never to work again.Though I feel I'm being ripped off, I cannot conceive of having to iron with anything else so I am forced to buy yet another one. As they say third times the charm, so my fingers as crossed."
4,worth the price,"Go through irons like crazy but this one seems to hold up. I use it daily and its easy to handle, plenty of steam and warms up fast."
1,Rowenta,"Simply put, this iron never worked. No steam, heat was intermittent, just really disappointed and sent it back."
1,Just don't do it...,"Even purchasing distilled water to use in the iron and emptying it out after each use, every Rowenta I have purchased (four now, I know--a glutton for punishment) has ended up leaking water within months of purchase. And when I say leak, I mean, dumping the entire contents of the iron onto the pad of my ironing board (if I'm lucky and it doesn't end up on whatever I'm ironing!). I'm trying another one this time around. I will never spend that kind of money again for an iron (Consumer Reports has rated a $20 black and decker as high as the Rowentas, and I'm a lot happier about losing $20 if the B&D; doesn't work as promised)!I am a sewer--I sew a LOT. The Rowentas, until the water starts leaking, is great as far as pressing stuff and steaming out wrinkles, don't get me wrong. It's just a collasal waste of money to spend as much as Rowenta asks to have it break within such a short time!"
2,MADE IN CHINA DO NOT BUY,"This iron is a piece of crap. The auto off cuts in while you are ironing. No matter how much you shake this thing it is hard to get it to come back on. I bought this iron thinking it was made in Germany. As I look at the bottom of the box, I can see it is made in China. Very deceptive marketing. May the buyer beware."
3,Burst of steam wouldn't work,"I bought this iron and loved it.....EXCEPT the burst of steam wouldn't work. Took it back and got the same one only to find that it had the same problem. I emailed Rowenta and they responded with some trouble shooting that didn't work either. Needless to say, I took it back and got a Black and Decker Digital Advantage.....LOVE IT!"
1,Poor Quality/Customer service lacking,"This iron lasted about 3 years and then started having problems with the ""auto shutoff feature""Contacted the folks at Rowenta and they said the parts associated with this feature were not available forreplacement..........(I am an electrical engineer).......Although I talked to one of my co-workers whohas this same iron/same problem and was told how to ""bypass"" this feature I opted NOT to do this becauseits pretty hard to replace the content of your house because you were to ""cheap"" to buy another iron...Oh Yeah ...the folks from Rowenta sent me a rebate form towards the purchase of another iron (5-20 dollars depending on what rowenta model you purchase) I purchased a sunbeam iron for 30 dollars instead.......Moral of the ""story""........You pay 60 dollars for an iron made in China and you throw it away after 3 years of extremely limited use...Hopefully we will have better luck with the sunbeam"
1,I was apprehensive and tried it anyway - HORRIBLE!!,"I read many of the reviews good and bad, and decided to try the iron anyway. Immediately, i had drops of water all over the expensive fabric i was ironing and the iron scorched the fabric. I read that it can do this but that it happens after months of use. IT HAPPENED ON THE FIRST DAY!! and yes, it is made in china. i will NEVER buy another Rowenta product again in my LIFE. Don't try this iron. It's too expensive to bother with when all the reviews tell you EXACTLY what it will do wrong. The only step left is for you to BELIEVE what they say and don't bother!!! LIFE IS TOO SHORT!!"
2,Nice while it lasted,"You've read the reviews - works well then one day it doesn't heat up. It is out of warranty by a year. Cost to ship and evaluate makes it useless. I guess it's back to the cast iron antique iron on the wood stove. No leaks, no cord to get in the way, and it doubles as a door stop! Seriously, who makes a durable iron anymore?"
1,Total malfunction!,"Up until this morning, I would probably give this iron a 4-star review. BUT ... after sitting in the upright position for about 5 minutes it started smoldering! It was literally melting! Thank goodness we were home. Having walked a way for even that short period of time, it filled our master bedroom closet with smoke and noxious fumes. Naturally the toxic fumes filled our master bathroom & bedroom & even permeated the walls into our baby's room. Her closet and our closet are back to back, yet our rooms are not even as close to each other as our other children's rooms, yet our baby's room smelled the worst. Even with her bedroom door closed. 13 hours later now, and the smell is still there! I WILL NOT be purchasing another Rowenta product & I certainly won't be recommending any. I sure hope I can find some recall information about this product."
1,Cheaply made iron that leaks,"I bought this iron about a year ago and while I was initially happy with it for the first month or two, things went down hill quickly. The iron leaks water from different locations causing ironing to be a frustrating activity. Also, the water is very hard where I love so the iron needs to be cleaned frequently with vinegar to remove deposits, otherwise when it steams it will leave stains on my clothes.From my research it seems that Rowenta has a good reputation but I have had nothing but disappointment with this product. I highly recommend purchasing another brand."
1,Rarely Used This Iron - Now Will be Replacing it for the 2nd Time,"Bought this from Macy's. Fortunately, they have a good exchange/return policy.Barely used it had to exchange it after a year of ownership. Now after two more years, is having the same problem. Power keeps going out. Horrible horrible reliability. Would not recommend this iron to anyone. Not sure if I'm going to be anymore Rowenta irons."
1,Made in China-But They Won't Take It Back,"I previously had the Rowenta DX6900 and it worked fantastic until I had problems with the line cord shorting out. Since I had gotten my moneys worth out of the iron, I decided to purchase another Rowenta. Guess I should've done my home work! I purchased the DX1700 and ""Let the Problems Begin!"" The first one turned off when it wanted to;just as others have said in previous posts. I returned it after 2 weeks! (..And I never return anything!)Decided to give Rowenta another chance and traded that one for another DX1700. Well, 3 months later and this one is doing the same thing! Think I'm just going to switch brands and call this a loss. Didn't save my receipt because I just knew with the quality of Rowenta, I would never have to return an iron twice....Please slap me! ""Fool me once, shame on you. Fool Me Twice, Shame on ME!Folks.....Don't Buy this CRAP from China."
2,Too bad it's made in China,"This is my 3rd and last Rowenta steam iron in 5 years. German design is fine, but Chinese manufacturing quality is obviously inadequate. Two or 3 years of service isn't acceptable. I just didn't have the time to research another suitable brand and quickly ordered this. I iron a lot and have to have a well-functioning, reliable and durable iron. It's worked ok so far, now let's see how long it lasts."
1,Unreliable,"I'm writing this review of my 3rd Rowenta steam iron. I had one that lasted for a while initially - about a year. It started leaking so I looked locally for a new one. I purchased a replacement at a local housewares store. The new one immediately leaked, so I returned it for a replacement. I've had the replacement model for about 4 months. This one continually turns the steam off. I have to manually turn the steam switch on several times while ironing. It's now developed a nasty habit of engaging the auto-off feature while I'm ironing.This is the last Rowenta iron that I'll buy. I've just ordered a T-Fal iron from Amazon after checking with Consumer Reports. Save yourself some trouble and money and buy a different iron."
1,No Germany - No Quality,"This Rowenta model is a big comedown from Rowenta's previous quality. A previous DX1700 I owned lasted about 6 years with heavy usage. The replacement I have now is garbage. The first replacement DX1700 I brought home made strange noises from day one and fizzled out within a week. The second replacement has spit when the vents are wide open from day one and I only chose to keep it because of the hassle of another return. After two years, the burst of steam button is now sticking from constant use because of the other problem. When I noticed that these irons were made in China, not Germany as was the case in the past, I contacted Rowenta to let them know that their quality was suffering. I was told that the facilities they use in China match the quality of those made in Germany. If that's the case, why are the models made in Germany approximately 100% more expensive than the DX1700? All I can say is shame on Rowenta. I'm looking for a new brand."
2,My first Rowenta........ummm......,"This is my first Rowenta iron & I feel as if I sat through a bad movie that had a sexy preview. Doesn't seem to offer as much steam as the description would have you believe. Weight is nice, glide bottom is fine, but that stupid auto-off feature needs to go. When I saw Made in China on the bottom, I started to wonder if this was the Germans trying to be funny. Gonna try the next model up to see if there's something to be gained. In short, this is no better than a $15 iron from your grocery store. $20 says the Salvation Army has something better for sale. Where's Grandma's iron when you need the right tool for the job?"
2,UNRELIABLE PRODUCT - STAY AWAY,"I have the same problem with the auto-shutoff as several other reviewers on amazon and elsewhere. Bought this in Aug'07. The autoshutoff started kicking in even when the iron was in use. Suddenly during use, iron shuts off and red light begins to blink. Only way to restart - switch on and off OR bang it down hard sideways on the ironing board (""gentle sideways shaking"" recommended by the manual doesn't cut it). Then 15-20 seconds later - same problem.Returned to sears and go a replacement in Sept'07. Autoshutoff broke again again in May'08.Out of 90 days return/replace policy - so Sears won't return OR replace. Only option to send to Rowenta service center prepaid and wait for 2-3 weeks for it to come back.Better toss and buy a different brand. WITH extended warranty this time. Oh well... No more Rowenta EVER."
1,Worst Iron I have EVER owned!!!,I cannot tell you how many times I have wanted to throw this iron out the window! I have had the same problem with the auto-off feature as another reviewer. To get the iron to turn on you have to tilt the iron back and forth from laying flat to standing up. Then once it is on the auto-off function typically kicks in 30 seconds later and the iron turns off. I then have to go through the same process again of tilting the iron. This goes on for a while and then I find myself shaking the heck out of the iron trying to get it to turn back on. At this point water from the iron has leaked all over the shirt I am trying to iron. So now I have a wet wrinkled shirt and I am so angry I could throw the iron out the window. I HATE THIS IRON!!!!
1,disappointing,"After one and a half years of using this steam iron approximately once a month for two hours it started to drip brown spots on the garments. Something's definitely rusting inside and I swear I've always emptied it after use and let it air dry on the countertop before storing away. Now all of a sudden the Auto-off comes on every Minute after plugging it in and I learn from other reviews, that that's a common problem. How annoying! Of course there's no warranty on the iron anymore. I would have lived with the missing lid for the opening to fill in water and I would have lived with the unconvenient cord, but the price was definitely too high for something that stops working after such short time. I'll definitely stay away from products made in China and rather go for something produced someplace in Europe."
5,Rowenta Iron,Rowenta's are the best. I am a repeat buyer. The price on this iron is a deal. It works very well-you can iron faster and better-throws a lot of steam and you can easily get around buttons. Service from this site was fast.
2,Irons Well but With a Lot of Headaches,"This iron works well and gets hot very quick. It Irons well.Now the bad: It flips into protection mode as if its been knocked over every minute no matter what position it is in. It must then be shaken back and forth until it senses it is in the upright position again. Also it is made in China, so you're paying for a premium product from a German brand but its no better than Black in Decker in the end.My advice: Avoid, there are much better irons out there."
1,Don't buy,"I do not recommend doing business with this supplier.My shipment came with no packing material cushioning the iron. There was also no paperwork with the itemThis item LEAKS and does not work properly. And due to the business practices of this shipper, I have no way to return it.Buy your iron from a local store. At least then you can take it back."
1,Rowenta Effective Iron,This is absolutely the worst iron I have ever owned. It wants to stick to the clothes and not glide smoothly. I've cleaned the soleplate and it still doesn't glide smoothly. It has to be heated up really good before I can get it to glide at all. It's also very heavy. It also doesn't steam well. I have to use the burst of steam to get it to do anything.
1,picture not true,I wouldnt know I ordered this iron two times both times it was shipped it was the wrong iron it show in this picture it being a pink iron and its not
1,If I could give a LOWER score I would,"I've had this iron for about a year. Before that I had a cheap old iron for about 15 yrs. Today I am throwing it in the trash. It has been a PIECE OF JUNK from the beginning -what a waste of $50!! It LEAKS, all the plastic dials kept popping off and I had to DUCT TAPE the whole thing to keep it together after a month. Everyone who saw it laughed and told me to get a new iron but this WAS my new iron! If I hadn't spent so much $$ on it I would have tossed it in the trash and bought a new one a while back. It would constantly shut off WHILE YOU ARE USING it, making ironing even MORE annoying and finally just won't heat up at all. I strongly recommend getting either the cheapest one you can find or splurging on a STAINLESS STEEL iron. NEVER EVER get anything with ANY plastic on it at all. This should have been a $10 iron. Now that I learned my lesson the hard way, I've invested in a commercial grade stainless steel iron, and it's NOT a Rowenta."
1,Two reasons to hate this iron,"I was pretty excited when I bought this iron and it worked pretty well for a few months. Then it started leaking. Just when you've got something ironed, it dumps out a huge puddle of water and then you're ironing again to try to dry the spot. This happens OVER and OVER. So frustrating.Fast forward to about a year or so after purchase and it now leaks a blackish color water onto everything. I'm through with this iron and it ruining my clothing. Piece of junk was made in China, not Germany, and is not the quality I expected when I spent north of $50 on it."
2,Stopped working after a year,"I loved this iron until it stopped working after minimal use for 1 year. That being said, I'm giving Rowenta one more try with their German made pro version."
2,Useless,"After less than a year it's died. This thing was incredibly thirsty, but I put up with it because it did a decent job. For some reason the steam only seemed to work when the iron was vertical rather than horizontal, so I'd iron a piece of sheet and then stand the iron up and a massive jet of steam would puff out into the air.... useless.Over the last 3 months it has started to leak from the handle down onto my hand no matter how full it was. Useless.Then today it started making a random clicking/sparking noise and the light has been flickering on and off. My last iron exploded in sparks and smoke so I'm not taking any chances with this one, it's going in the trash and I'll have to waste yet MORE money on another iron. In 12 years I've had about 8 irons. I do a lot of ironing (I find it enjoyable and clothes just look better when ironed) but really I expect items to last longer than this. Useless."
2,Constant Shut-Off is Turn-Off,"I was really hoping for a much better iron, but was greatly disappointed. As with many of the reviewers here, this iron leaks incessantly, leaving stains on my shirts. But the most annoying aspect is that the iron suddenly turns off right in the middle of ironing. You have to go unplug it, then plug it back in. Super annoying!"
1,WORST IRON EVER OWNED,"This review is from my wife.I should have listened to review of one of the people who purchased this iron before I did. The person said they were disappointed because the all this iron did was leak. All I've ever owned were Rowenta irons so I figured this person got a defective porduct. WRONG!!! I ordered it anyway and my steam iron turned out to be a ""GET DRENCHED AS YOU GO"" iron. I cannot iron anything without this iron leaking all over everyting I iron. I never leave reviews because I am always satisfied (my bad) however people PLEASE STAY AWAY FROM THIS IRON. YOU WILL REGRET IT.My Mom's Proctor Silex is so better than this one. Unbelievable."
1,Broken,"This iron includes a ""3 Way Auto-Off"" feature. It is documented as:""- If the iron is not moved while it is plugged in, an internal safety switch will turn it off.- It will turn off in 8 minutes if left vertically or in 30 seconds if left on its soleplate or tipped over. A red flashing light indicates that the auto-off has been activated.- To switch the iron on again, move the iron or gently shake it.""In my case the the auto-off activates 30 seconds after being plugged in and there is no way to deactivate it. Therefore, it is not possible to keep the iron heated and it is not functional."
1,Did not last,I bought this iron in June 2009. It quit on me this weekend. This winter the auto shut off was failing. I constantly had to unplug and replug the iron in the last few days so that it would reset itself. It is not suppose to leak but it does. The sole plate needs to be cleaned often when you use the high cotton setting and iron dark fabrics. For a Rowenta I expected it to last longer than it did - I didn't even get 2 years out of it. I do not recommend this product!
1,leaking iron,"The rowenta Iron model 1700 w Has leaked a little since the day it was new, should have returned it then, my mistake. a little more then a year later water is pouring out the bottom. When i went on line to ask an expert they want $28.00 from me to answer. They then say that if I am not completely satisfied I will not have to pay. Until you put up good faith money they will not even acknowledge you. This Company is lacking in integrity!I will never buy or say anything positive about ROWENTA."
1,Enrages me every day....total crap...Leaks like a sieve,"Do not buy this over-priced piece of junk. I spent somewhere around $70 for this item at Best Buy, thinking that Rowenta is the ""Cadillac of irons"". Not quite a year after purchase, the iron started leaking from the blue plastic housing below the grip. So basically as you get 1/4 way through ironing a shirt or pants, it drips water onto the garment and you have to run the iron over the spot to dry it out. The iron continually does this, in effect doubling your ironing time. It's clearly a manufacturing issue. I owned a cheap Black and Decker iron for years before buying this, and I never had any similar problems. Rowenta really failed to live up to the respect their brand holds. I won't be spending another $70 on anything from Rowenta...total piece of junk."
1,Extremely Fragile,"This binder did not survive a single week of regular use. I do place above-average load on my binders, but I certainly expect them to last more than a week. The bottom locking ring no longer aligns and the close switch will not stay in the locked position.I would not recommend this binder for anything but the lightest of archival duties. Under no circumstances should it be utilized in an environment where it will encounter physical stress.I purchased the 6"" variant of this binder."
5,Great buy,This product works great. We use it to clean our Lab's ear during warmer months when it gets dirty or gunky. A great buy and must have for me.
1,There is better Lena to get,"The sound quality is poor. Sure, there are 20 songs (including ""Stormy Weather"") but there is no track information and the recordings are not re-mastered."
4,it may be a live recording,"I also think it's not better thanBach: Matthäus-Passion (St. Matthew's Passion) / Sir Georg SoltiandMessiah. I think the mix and mastering of this stuff is not so good, for it may be a live recording. And it's expensive. I bought the Japanese issue of Solti's Mass in B minor for 1500 yen.Recorded 1990"
5,Candy from my childhood.....,"As an Army brat, I basically spent my youth in Germany. This was many, many moons ago in the fifties, actually. Gummi bears were the staple movie candy and so whenever I treat myself to goodies now it usually is a version of that. This candy did the job and was a great taste trip down memory lane. I did not share. I want more."
1,large abc gummi,"I was disappointed with the items purchased. I assumed they were the ""normal"" size gummi letters...they were very large ones. They did not have the same taste...I am a ""specialist on gummi's""...I can tell what flavor they are without looking at them, before eating them. This is after many many years of eating them (50+). And they can only be Haribo!!!! I have never seen this large one before. As you may have noticed, I then ordered the ""normal"" size letters."
2,wrong item,"I ordered this to give as a gift. I rec'd the package, opened it up and it was completely the wrong thing. Haribo had mislabled the box and what I rec'd was 5 lbs. of sugar coated gummy apples instead. I was very diappointed although Amazon was very understanding and refunded me the total amount.I hesitate to order this item again."
5,Everyone's favorite,"Gummy letters have been my daughters favorite candy since forever. I ordered a 5 lb bag to serve at her bridal shower. Turns out they are everybody's favorite, grown women so excited to see a childhood favorite. Great price."
1,Save your money,"I was very disappointed with this cd. I was expecting maybe some soothing background music or sound effects to go along with the guided meditation, instead its just a very mono-tone man speaking lots of uninteresting common sense I could have recorded myself.Make your own guided meditation cd and save yourself some money."
3,Help Put Me To Sleep,As in everyone this is something that either touches you deeply or helps in other ways.
1,Boring and very disappointing,"I was very disappointed when I tried this CD. I found it so boring that instead of relaxing me it actually made me tense. Not worth the $19 at all. He is very monatone and there are a lot of pauses and long periods of silence. Also, there is no music. Save yourself the money."
2,Not so good for insomniacs,"I bought this CD in the hope it would help with severe, intractable insomnia I have had for the last 5 years. Several times during the session I found myself drifting off, but then the voice would startle me awake. I found it to be irritating because it kept waking me up. I don't know if this is how the CD/Yoga Nidra is supposed to be used but I would not recommend this particular recording if you are trying to relieve insomnia."
1,Disappointing. and rather boring.,"When I purchased this CD I thought it was by Swami Janakananda Saraswati. He has a CD that I absolutely love called ""Experience Yoga Nidra"" (see my other Amazon review). I was disappointed when I tried this CD, which I realize now is Swami Jnaneshvara Bharati. He talks in a monatone, no music or sounds and alot of silence and pauses. At some of the moments I thought something was wrong with my CD player ;o) This CD was boring for me and became rather irritating even when I put it away and tried it again later.I guess my expectations were quite high after experiencing ""Experience Yoga Nidra"" with Swami Janakananda Saraswati. If you're looking for a really good Yoga Nidra CD, I would recommend his instead. I like his soothing voice, and lovely music and nature sounds. I use it time and time again and it is well worth the money.See my other reviews on meditation and yoga CD's and DVD's on Amazon."
5,Best Yoga Nidra CD I have listened,Swami J has developed the CD in proper yogic way. There are 5 tracks in total. Tracks 2 to 5 can be listened as a single track. I practice my yoga nidra with this CD.
2,No music in background,I didn't much care for the fact that there is no soft music in the background.
1,poor,"This is a terrible CD.Do not buy.And it is not worth the price.Sounds like Mr Roger""s imaginary world. For example, how on earth do you inhale and exhale from your forehead?If you are truly interested in Yoga read""Light on Yoga ""by B.K.S. Iyengar."
1,Don't waste your time,"I purchased this CD on ebay and it is the biggest waste of money ever! I only paid a total of $8 for it but super boring. He has many pauses and you think the cd is over and then he talks again. Not very relaxing. I don't know if it is because I am so stressed that nothing is going to work, or if I just don't get the concept. Check out the website before you buy and really understand what you are buying. If all else fails, I have a copy I will sell you CHEAP!!"
1,DON'T BUY!!!,THIS IS NOT SOOTHING AT ALL. DON'T KNOW WHAT THE POSITIVE REVIEWERS WERE LISTENING TOO BUT THIS IS NOT AN EXCELLENT MEDITATION CD AT ALL. WISH I COUD RETURN.
4,Yoga Nidra works well thusfar...........,"Having listened to the Yoga Nidra a few times now, I can say that it has worked well but thusfar I have not reached the depths of relaxation which the authors claim as is its potential. Basically, it uses the method of concentration on particular parts of the body and relaxing those, only it takes it to extremes going through over sixty body parts, including repetitions. The CD lasts over 65 minutes but that includes one span of ten minutes where nothing is said and you are left to move deeper into your relaxed state. All in all it is a very relaxing experience though it does use this basic familiar method with a few twists in its application."
5,Very usefull meditation,"I heard this CD several times. Some others critizice the author, either because they are falling asleep or the did not hear music. I have lsitened to serveral guided meditations. Most of them without music. I have some relaxation CDs, too. For me relaxation is not meditation. I agree that this is no meditation for beginners. Espacially not track 4. To me it seems that some people have unrealistic expectations to meditation CDs. Meditation needs training. And one should not start with the most complicated. To me it is an excellent CD, especially because it is without music, but pure meditation."
5,Soooooooooo helpful,"I switch back and forth between using this CD and Richard Miller's CD. Between the pair of them, I have gotten tremendous results. Because I use meditation to supplement treatments for illness, I can see how much it has effectively touched my entire life. My body heals faster and my treatment sessions have become much more effective and I am progressing so much faster. The more I practice meditating, the more effective it becomes and yoga nidra has become such a powerful tool on the road to recovery."
2,OK,"I liked this CD and find yoga nidra to be a very powerful technique. Aesthetically I must confess that the CDs by James Jewell are more appealing, both because of his deep calm voice, and also because of the soothing background cello music makes it that much easier to open and to sink into the deeper state. (If you don't know them, the CDs by James Jewell are:Yoga Nidra, Wakeful Sleep - Deep Healing RelaxationandOpening to Chakra Awareness)"
3,Great for sleeping! Not so great for Yoga Nidra.,"This disc is very restful, very relaxing, and puts me to sleep quickly, which is nice since I am an insomniac. But Yoga Nidra is suppose to be a deep meditation where the mind remains concious. If you fall asleep you are defeating the prupose and will not get the full benifit of Yoga Nidra.Still, it's nice to get a restful sleep, and so I use the technique on this disc when I go to bed to lull me to sleep. I pull out my Experience Yoga Nidra Disc to meditate"
1,What a waste!,"The Oralgiene etc. is a complete waste of money. One would expect a battery-powered tongue cleaner to help remove bacteria better than a conventional one, but it doesn't. The Oralgiene simply and meekly vibrates in your hand (not in your mouth) as you swipe the sharp tip on your tongue. Although the Oralgiene is more effective than a toothbrush, it doesn't compare to a manual tongue cleaner."
2,Get a manual one at your local drug store.,"I hate leaving bad reviews for products on Amazon, but I have no choice for this product. The product is very small and fragile. The plastic is no more than a couple millimeters thick and I managed to break the battery compartment within about 2 minutes of opening the package. The overall idea is a good one, however, the product needs to be built better. The whole unit is so extremely fragile, which is not a good thing considering you have to apply pressure against your tongue while using the product. I will say that it does what it is supposed to, but there are too many cons to give it a good rating. G.U.M brand makes a nice manual tongue cleaner that you can pick up at any local drug store for $2-$3. You will likely get the same results. My opinion is not to purchase this product."
1,Waste of money.,"I purchase many items on Amazon but, this is my first review. I felt compelled to write a review because this item is worthless. The handle vibrates but the scraper does not. My manual tongue cleaner does a much better job. Do not waste your money on this item. I threw mine in the trash after a week. This item does not even deserve 1 star."
3,Back to the 80's!,"A fun read, following the formula of 80's books in this genre : a group of disillsioned Vietnam Vets can't fit back into 'normal' society, so they find their niche working as mercenaries for Uncle Sam - doing the dirty work the government can't officially condone. This book has the standard setting of books from written at this time - Central America, with some Soviets and Warsaw Pack troops thrown in as the chief nemisis.Death Machine is a page turner that feels like a combination between Mac Bolan, the ATeam and a Chuck Norris action movie. If you like this type of story or feel nostalic for the 80's, this will be a worthwhile read. When its over you'll almost feel like saying that A Team catch phrase, ""I love it when a plan comes together."""
4,Love it!!!,"With my second baby due in Feb - I knew I would need something to keep her warm. I purchased this product and LOVE IT! The color is beautiful, it is snuggly, warm and soft and my baby falls right to sleep in it. As she is only 4 weeks old, it can be a little big (how to explain?)... it bunches a bit at the feet so I have to push it down. But it is a great product and I'm sooo glad we got it!"
4,Sanky Panky,"This is got to be one of the funniest movie I have ever seen....of course you'll have a better understanding of the movie if you have visited the island and relate to the topic....for me since we have a condo at Punta Cana and most of the film was shoot with the background of the Barcelo Caribe Hotel, we can totally relate to this....Sanky Panky is a way of life there(unfortunate)and I must say this.....looking at the types of women and men these people have to go out with, they deserve all of my respects and antiacid tablets, soap, deodorant plus mouthwash.......The reason I did not gave the film five stars is because, at the end of the movie it seems that the director sort of went crazy and could not well explain a good ending and you're left like Okay whatever.....The DVD comes with an audio CD (as an added bonus) which brings the soundtrack of the movie."
4,HILARIOUS,LOVE THIS MOVIE... GREAT JOKES... WHEN YOU WATCH IT PAY ATTENTION TO THE WRITING ON THE WALLS AND CARS THOSE ARE REALLY FUNNY...
5,Tremendo,Wow.. This movie is awesome. I laughed the whole time. Best movie from the Dominican Republic so far.
4,Funny movie... SLOW shipping,"LOVED this movie- sooo funny. Gennaro (the main character)aims to be a ""sanky panky"" (google the term if you don't know what it is) although he really does not fit the mold. Hilarity ensues when he thinks he found the ""gringa"" of his dreams. Which is funny because they are totally just Dominican women, trying to act like gringas. There is even a cameo with Henry from Aventura.However, it has taken Amazon FOREVER (like 4 months) to ship this out. My advice, find somewhere else to buy it if you want to see this movie any time soon."
5,The best movie of the year.,"I recommend to buy this movie. This movie is about what people would do to get out of there country thinking that by coming here they're going to have a better life. But they're wrong there is nothing better than the families and friends that you have around you than being here in this country were is cold and bitter. The good thing about this movie is that it teach you what you have in your country, but in a funny way. You we laugh you heart out if you purchase this movie."
5,GREAT,It's hilarious! You must speak spanish to really get all the good jokes) great for a movie night with the fam!! :-)
5,Strung Out On Three Days Grace,"A very nice, soothing, string tribute to Three Days Grace. Although, the cover art chosen is slightly misleading, as it depicts their One-X album cover art, when in fact all of the songs on it are from Three Days Grace's self-titled debut album. But you probably already knew that from the song previews. Also, if you like this tribute, I suggest you take a look at the other one that has some songs from the Life Starts Now and One-X albums,String Tribute to Three Days Grace."
2,A Misleading and Disappointing Swindle,"I would have only given this 1 star, but the music is great and sounds quite good in surround, though by no means spectacular. That said, I was expecting to get a hidef trip to the symphony, *NOT* a cheesy, corny slide show of ocean splash and hazy harbors!?! I couldn't believe it when I put it on! I thought it was just the title splash screen (no pun intended), but nope, this is it! The venue would have been beautiful to film in hidef and this is what I was expecting. And the price!? I was so angry I couldn't even enjoy the music. DO NOT buy this very deceptively packaged product. For the money, you can get a used, 1980's era DG recording for <$5 that will sound just as good and play on all your gear; not just an HD player."
2,Musical slide show with a re-issue recording.,"The graphics promoting this release clearly showed a orchestra on the cover. When I received the album the front cover art was of a seascape. If you think your going to see an actual performance of Rachmaninov's 2 greatest piano concerto's you will be, as I was, sorely disappointed. This is a reissue of an earlier Naxos release. The soloist, Konstantin Scherbakov, is superb but the Russian State Symphony Orchestra is simply not up to the task. This performance was released by Naxos in a 2 channel and a DVD-A mix, where Surround Records got a 7.1 mix out of the original masters is, well, a stretch. There are many, many great recordings of these works that you can get for less money. Might be a nice demo for a hdtv show room but not much else."
1,If you only want audio get a cd,"Well, I guess you must have a good surround sound set up to rate this highly. I do not have surround sound so, the music was not so great. Plus, you have no ability to select any of the music, the only selection is for the visuals. If I only want audio, then I get a CD. CD recordings I have of Rachmaninov sound much better to me than this. The visuals are very, very disappointing - just static low resolution pictures of shore and water."
2,Hard and Boring,"Oh my gosh, this game is awful!! The first couple of levels are okay but after that the game is almost impossible, unless I'm missing something, this game is not very well explained, there seems to be no way at all to get past Level 3-1, ugh, I haven't even picked this game up in a couple months for fear of becoming extremely frustrated again. Not only that but the character controls are very slow and frustrating. The only good part are the graphics. Don't buy this!!"
4,Hassle but Quality Game,"This game has great graphics and challeging Levels. Note that the other reviews talk about the difficulty of Level 3, and until I realized Shrek could run, it was hard for me as well. After learning that I got passed it on the second try. There is a Level that you need to escape from the castle/dragon and THAT was very hard. Having some challenges makes for a good game to me. Overall, if you know how to move the players, Shrek is a very fun and challenging game. Wouldn't recommend for younger kids however, possibly a little too difficult."
1,Ocean Science Propaganda,"I was hoping for a book of fun facts and activities, but instead, the scattering of Global Warming propaganda in the book attempts to terrorize young children into worrying if they forget to turn off a light in their room, cute sea animals will be murdered."
3,"Nice random shapes, but a little small","These fake ice cubes are kinda neat, but their size is a little small. If you are looking for something that looks like the cubes seen in commercials and print ads, I wouldn't get these. Their shape is quite random and that's nice, but they definitely aren't cube shaped. Each one is about an inch across or smaller.On the other hand, you do get a lot of them. Two pounds of these almost fills a gallon-sized ziploc bag.Also, they do not have any seams or flashing from a molding process. Their surface is very smooth and clean and they are crystal clear."
4,"Looks Good, Works Well",These fake cubes worked just as we needed. Look good in our videos and still shots. Easy to place as needed and easy to clean if they get dirty.
3,Acrylic chips,"These chips are pretty small. Used alone they do not give the effect of real ice. I mixed mine with larger cubes but still wasn't real happy with the ""realistic"" factor."
4,Very nice and cheaper then...,"Looks great in my Christal skull and the leds bounce off great. Much cheaper then tapp plastics prices, like 1/10th the cost.I think tapp must be smoking something funny to attempt to charge so much."
1,Unlistenable,"The voices are wonderful, but the recording is so faulty that only the two tracks from Iolanthe sound at all okay. At first I thought it was my equipment, then realized that the CD was at fault. And I bought one for myself and one for a friend! I adore Gilbert & Sullivan and D'Oyly Carte is the best, but this particular CD shouldn't be offered for sale."
4,Music for the baby!,"I am the caregiver for my newborn grandson who is VERY VERY fussy. There are all kinds of CDs with soothing music for the babies, BUT I happened to hear that opera was a great listen for the little ears and this one is the best. It has high voices and very low bass voices lots of BOOMs and arias. When I first put it on for him, (in the middle of a loud cry), he quieted down almost as soon as the first stanza was over. He now smiles and waves his little arms and legs around when I turn it on. He Listens and loves this CD, and so do I! The words are hard to understand but the sounds are marvelous. If you know of any mother/father who is wanting music for a small baby/child, tell them about Gilbert and Sullivan (and they will enjoy it, too)."
4,Massive Brain Overload! 4.5 Stars,Great album if you are into Metal/PSY-Trance (which I am). Hard to find group. Get it if you can handle it.
3,Jump from platform to platform to platform to platform . . .,"If you have the Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets DVD and watched the preview of the video game on the extras disk, THIS IS NOT IT; that's the Playstation 2 (or ""better"") game you're seeing. This one is a pale imitation. You mostly run around Hogwarts, shoot little balls of light out of your wand, and face sequential challenges, all of which seem to revolve around precision-jumping from one platform to another.It's not a BAD game; it has it's moments. But it shows that even the irrepressible Harry Potter can't escape the Curse of the Movie-Spinoff Video Game."
4,How I feel about this game.,"The game is quite cool to me ! I have completed the first harry potter game and craving for more after that , and finally my dream come true! just a few comment to the 'Harry Potter and the camber of secrets' game is that the sound of harry potter is very weird, it sounds like a sisi to me. The good thing is that they added a few more game in it to make it more intresting like "" the wizard duel , race record for you to broke while you head for lesson, the are grades "" A ,B , C "" too to your performance in class( SO IT IS NOT SO BORING LIKE THE FIRST ONE).Of all ...... the best part is the quidditch match ! you must race against your rival malfoy and knock him down before you can continuce to catch the snitch. The are also many thing on the way to slow you down and don't forget the budlger behind you. SO GET IT NOW PEOPLE......... SEE YOU IN HOGWARTS....."
1,NOT WORTH BUCKS,"This game is ok but the controls are horrible! The best part is throwing gnomes. Like the first game it is way to easy. I dont even own it and I'm already in the forest looking for the spiders. Prof. Lockhart looks like someone hit him with a can opener. Doby looks like a rat. Colin Creevey is tiny, and Ginny Weasley looks like a pig. Harry FINNALY TALKS. Moaning Myrtle and Peeves are annoying. Myrtle chucks toilet pipes at you for some odd reason. Peeves also steals Rons present to Nick. You get to play as Goyle but he is so annoying you cant stand yourself. One of the only cool things about this game is hogwarts seems to have doubled in size. If I were you id wait to buy it untill the price drops. Dramatically."
2,We've heard it before...,"Well, I know that Ministry's career was/is supposed to end in a trilogy of anti-Bush albums. I guess if you like a lot of protest/political music, then that's something that works for you. I also realize that Al has made political music throughout his career. As for me: Enough is enough. The most ""new"" thing about the album is more of a metal sound than most of his works, but that's not a major difference really. Some of it is good, but it's not the most memorable album and the concept wears thin as you're listening to the album. We get the point, and it won't be changed for another two years, but come on: This is nothing particularly special. As the other reviewer said, ""Greater Wrong of the Right"" by Skinny Puppy was a much better leftist album than the two more recent from Ministry, and I actually enjoyed ""Molé"", since that was also diverse and artistically interesting. This is just more of the same and it's not even interesting this time around. Next..."
5,Gang Green,"I'm a former Marine and I love this album. I understand that Al is kind of being satirical towards the Marine Corps, but I'll let it slide. This album has a lot of energy just like Ministry is supposed to have. Al's message is a great and meaningful one that concerns us all and the art work shows that he is really paying attention to what is truely going on behind the curtain of secrecy. Five stars all the way."
2,Didn't I already buy this once before?,"The tradition of every Ministry album sounding different from the others comes to a screeching and shockingly boring halt. This album is so similar to Houses of the Mole, I can barely tell the difference. Except for the one somewhat unique track, Khyber Pass, it's 100% recycled riffs and Bush sound bites. And the Bush stuff isn't nearly as funny this time around.Skip this and get Cocked and Loaded or Animositosomina. Does he really plan on doing a third disc exactly like Houses? My tradition of buying the latest Ministry release may also be coming to a screeching halt."
4,It's heavy! It's political! It's a new Ministry CD!,"Let the thrashing and Bush bashing commence! If you like your music fast and loud, you'll love this. It's quite a bit like their last release ""Houses of the Mole"". I liked that one, but I did burn out on it rather quickly and I think the same thing'll probably happen with this one. My favorite of their more recent releases has been 2003's ""Animositisomina"". It's much more varied, layered and complex. I still listen to it a lot even now. My favorite song on ""Rio Grande Blood"" is ""Khyber Pass""...so heavy and cool, I wish there was more of that style mixed amongst the fast and angry stuff."
4,Great music...the W bashing is a little old.....,"For those new to Ministry, maybe not the best place to jump in. Theres probably a few other ""essential"" releases to explore first. For the faithfull, is there really a bad Ministry CD? From Land of Rape & Honey on, it's all about dark/loud/industrial, etc etc. You cant go wrong. My only beef is the W bashing is a little old. I saw Al & friends recently at the House of Bluse Chicago. The 9/11, Bush, Osama video was not funny nor effective nor made a statement. So, if you like loud/fast/agressive rock-you cant go wrong. Great for 15.00...better on sale for 12.00!"
3,Skinny Puppy Did The Bush Bashing Better,"Two albums of Bush bashing and I'm a little bored with it. Houses couldn't keep my interest and neither does this Ministry record. It has a lot of energy and a lot of anger but it's just being too obvious and having little variation in themes throughout the two releases. Hey, I don't like Bush, most of the country doesn't care for him anymore either but making two whole albums dedicated to it? Come on! Oh yeah, and when Bush leaves office are any of the songs going to be relevant anymore? At least when Skinny Puppy made The Greater Wrong of the Right which had some negative Bush songs it was a little more vague and a lot more clever with other themes throughout the album. Plus SP are delving into new and interesting variations on the formula. Ministry has released the same thing twice in a row! I recommend everyone just get Skinny Puppy's latest CD instead. The current output by Ministry just can't compare to what Skinny Puppy is doing right now."
3,Uncle Al joins Brad and Angelina on thier mission to save planet Earth!,"Ok the ""music"" is good... but for the love of all things holy!! we get the freekin point.. you dont like Bush. Great! Wonderful! His ""lyrics"" are starting to sound around as mundane as these little whining skater bands complaining about thier mom and dad.I'm with the old dude who poster earlier. Al is really scary sounding...so thats good. The actual music is fun and all. But the message....GOD.. THE MESSAGE. I just HATE bands and actors who think they need to be all political. I dont care who you vote for. Just play your music. If you have a complaint, fine write one or two songs. But two albums of this crap, and most people, no matter how much they hate Bush, are going to be sick of it.For 2006, I have to say the new TOOL album is a much better pick than this. But its still a fun album. The profits made from this work will go towards Al adopting as many african children as possible. wheeeeee!!!!"
3,"Great Album, but again with the Anti-Bush","I love this album but the anti-Bush bashing is old now. It sorta worked for ""House of Moles"" but it seems like the same thing over again. I love the old style songs such as ""Just One Fix"", ""NWO"", ""Psalm 69"", ""Burning Inside"" etc... It's too bad this is supposed to be Ministry's last album and they end it with just bitter anti-Bush, anti-war. Other than the Bush bashing the album is awesome. Very fast and easy to get into. I recommend this album if you're willing to ignore the fact that most of the songs are about Bush and the war."
4,Easily one of my favorites,"This is easily one of my favorite Ministry albums. It shreds. Honestly, I was pretty impressed when I heard it.I understand how a lot of people could say that Al was just using Bush as a way to sell records, but if the majority of the population didn't like bush to begin with, then why the hell not?While it is true that the whole point he's trying to make has been done on other albums, there's no denying that the record itself sounds good. To me. and....countless other people that like it.Now I'm not going to get into specifics like song structure, or how many bpm's they're using in their songs, or whatever time signatures go alongside parts a and part c after b or any crap like like that, or whose got the best riff or whatever. if you want an album that's really intense, and stuff, go with this one.two words - grammy winner.I give it only four stars for not having any more tracks to hear when it was over. oh well. there's always the repeat button."
2,Not impressed at all.,"How many times are they going to make the same cd? Do yourself a favor, save some cash, and download it illegally. I bet Al Jourgensen sure likes the protection that the government gives his profits."
1,leftist crud,"Look Al play your music , but keep your opinions to yourself unless you give every one the opportunity to come on stage and voice their opinions, some by the way are different than yours and nut jobs like michael moore . leave the politics to politicians and stick to being a musician .Ok .I like Ministry ,just leave the tired old political rhetoric home its been done before and by better than you remember CSNY in the 60s.later."
3,Lots of frosting but no cake,"I enjoyed reading this book. But....I have read all off Brust's other novels, and liked (or more than liked) all of them except Freedom And Necessity. For a fan, this was a fun bit of fluff. We get to see some of our favorite characters again, and get introduced to a few new ones. And if you like Parfi, you get more of him. If you don't like Parfi, you get more of him anyway.But this book entirely lacks the emotional depth of a Vlad novel, to say nothing of a work like Agyar. For someone who does not know the characters involved, the book would be an exercise in frustration. There's no subtext here, just text.We do get some moments of Brust-like wit and style, but without an exciting story or a deeper structure it becomes a cake which is all frosting and no cake."
1,Death,"My daughter grew up with me reading her this series, and she's never gotten over the death of Tazendra. It appeared to be an unnecessary betrayal perhaps paralleling the author's own life."
1,The Paths of the Dull,"This book reads like a ""reverse"" Cliff Notes. What could have been written in 50 pages takes over 300. Mind-numbingly slow. Loose sample translation in plain English of the type of written exchanges: ""I think I'd like to tell you something. ""Then do so. ""I will. ""OK, I'd like to hear it. ""Then I will tell you at once. ""Please do. ""OK, I shall."" On and on and on. Randomly pick up ANY other book in the Fantasy section of a bookstore and you will probably enjoy it more. At least it will be more readable."
2,Terrible Writing Style,"The supposed narrator, ""Paarfi"" is verbose and inane. In the Vlad Taltos books, the sarcastic humor was hilarious. Here,the author takes five sentances in the dialogue that should take one. ""Why do you say that?""/"" Do not despair, I will tell you post haste""/""That would be most appreciated""/""This manner of speech gets old REAL QUICK!!!!!"" It's worse than Robert Jordan's constant prattle about what people are wearing down to the last stitch!!It's a shame, because I consider the Vlad series as one of my top three book series."
5,Practical and Powerful,"This book is really a useful step by step guidance to build a model using logistic regression. It is very practical and to the point. This book covers the business envrionment from high level and go down to the working data level and then again relate how the results from mining the data can solve busines problem. It is a treasure for data mining analyst and modelers.Just as the author point out, although there are many new model building techniques emerge every year, logistic regression still remains a very powerful data mining and model building tool. And it is well demonstrated in her detailed examples."
5,Excellent guide for real data mining,This book is an excellent step by step guide for data mining : it provides simple and complex modelling techniques.It adresses the SAS community (even non SAS people will also benefit from it)
2,SAS Tutorial or Data Mining Book?,"I was disappointed after reading 3 chapters of this book. Leafing forward, the book is saturated with SAS examples that I not only cannot understand but do not care about. It seems the whole book was written just to promote the (sold separately)...CD ROM with source SAS code. If you are going to write a SAS book, label it as such."
3,"Good, easy-to-read book, but lacks some best practice features","Good book for learning about the data mining techniques of logistic and linear regression. It helped highlight some good uses, and fortunately, I've recently had the opportunity to use it in my work.However, I was a bit disappointed that the data preparation seemed very coding intensive. The author could have shown readers how to merge lookup tables of risk values onto customer datasets, rather than hard-coding each of the rules and values; or to use the SAS procedure for creating indicator variables, instead of writing the rules for each category.Overall, I'm glad that I purchased the book - it lives up to its claims - but it misses some of the better practices, and time saving devices, in data preparation"
2,It's starting to come apart,"I bought this for my wife who is a huge Metallica fan. It looked nice when it first arrived. The Ninja star logo is very cool, but 3 months later the logo inside started shifting and it is no longer center inside the key chain. It seems to be poorly constructed."
3,too narrow,"Good quality but be aware that the paddle is narrower than it looks in the picture. Maybe 2 inches wide?? and so not useful for stirring risotto or much of anything else. Would have returned it but between the cost and hassle, I didn't. It's handsome, well made and useless."
5,Great,"This is great, I use it to push stuff around in my saute pan and help deglaze the fond when I cook. What's more to say... Batali is the man, but it is just a wooden spoon..."
1,vanity press,"Phyllis Zimmerman is convinced that Percy Shelley is a genius, and that Mary and others are not. Her way of arguing that ""Frankenstein"" (and other works) is written by Percy, is one of three:1) A passage is similar to something Percy has written2) A passage is similar to something Percy was going to writeand, if neither 1)or 2) suits:3) This is too good to be written by anyone else than PercyThis is what Zimmerman needs 600 pages to tell us.300 of them are quotes (sic!)Very boring, very unacademic. A totally waste."
4,Dig the chairs,"Quality of wood seems very good. Very comfortable, good classic design. Very affordable and easy to assemble.Tip on assembly - don't be aggressive in tightening down the few wood screws, wood does seem a little on softer side and could split (but didn't). Also concur with prior post, don't tighten everything down until it's all together. You need some wiggle room to get the rockers on. So first chair took about an hour. With the basic knowledge gained and the insight on not tightening, #2 took about 15 minutes."
2,not pleased with the finish,"This product, adirondeck chair, was advertised as havinga finish that would be good for indoor/outdoor use. Well, itdid not the finish is not uniform and I now have to sand andrestain it myself. It was a birthday gift and I am disappointed."
3,Complaint,"I was a little dissatisfied. I live in an apartment with sliding glass doors. The chairs are different widths and one of the chairs will not fit through without taking one of the arms off. The other chair already has a split in the arm of the chair. However, for the price. . . ."
1,DOES NOT FOLD!,"I bought two of these chairs. It is misleading to call them ""folding"" rocking chairs. Hardware needs to be removed in order for these chairs to fold. There are better wooden folding rocking chairs elsewhere for not much more money. Don't waste your money on these."
5,DAN FROM NY,"PURCHASED 2 CHAIRS, ORDERING, DELIVERY AND TRACKING THE DELIVERY ALL WENT WELL. CUSTOMER SERVICE ANSWERED MY ASSEMBLY QUESTIONS VIA EMAIL WITHIN 24 HRS. I WOULD BUY FROM THEM AGAIN."
3,Hmmmm - interesting book,I found this book to be a unique read - quite interesting.Maybe not the cure all for every marriage - but common sense.
4,Time Passer,"A good time passer, like rewatching a well known movie, because it is fun even if you know how it is going to go. If you like the genre and the author you will like the book."
1,the war gods own,ordered in paper back could not reAD IT DUE TO SMALL LETTERS SO HAD TO ORDER IN HARD BACK WISH THERE HAD BEEN A WAY to know that before i started to read it.i had to stop and wait on the hardback before i know if anygood or not
4,jackie mclean and company,A fine blowing session that hightlights the strange contrast between Mclean's alto sax and the tuba of Ray Draper on the first three songs. An excellent together group with some great soloing and arrangements.
1,Dakine Cobra Glove not sized as marked,"The gloves received were much smaller than the marked size. There was no assurance that a replacement pair of the same model would be sized as marked, so they had to be returned for a refund."
3,Wish I had ordered TWO sizes up,"These gloves are insanely small. After reading a few reviews online I ordered a size Large. In no way shape or form do I have a large hand. On the contrary, for a guy my size, my hands are pretty tiny. The larges are really snug. I wish I had an XL but Im too lazy to send them back and I need them for a trip this weekend."
4,Adequate overview,"This text is an excellent OVERVIEW of the history, context, and general techniques of blacksmithing. If you are looking for a general understanding of the art, this is the perfect text, and on that basis I recommend it very highly.I do NOT recommend this text for the serious student of the subject. The discussion is generally shallow and has a tendency toward casual errors. It also presents blacksmithing traditions as fact despite modern dispute (E.g., Edge packing, pp 168-169, is now generally considered nonsense by reputable blacksmiths). If you want to learn about practical blacksmithing techniques, Jack Andrew's ""New Edge of the Anvil"" is much, much better. If you want to learn to make weapons, Dr. Jim Hrisoulas' several books (""The Complete Bladesmith,"" ""Master Bladesmith,"" etc.) are much better, but very specialized.Summary: highly recommended as a general overview. Insufficient depth for specialized study."
4,My two cents,"Alex Bealer's text on the subject of blacksmithing is not only of experience, but also the experience of others. In his book he talks quite a bit about the late Sam Yellin. About smith's that he knows, and about his own smithing experience. It may be long winded to some, or may be pompous. Yet Mr. Bealer is sharing not only knowledge with you. But opening doors to the same past we came from. I have been a hobby smith for 16 years, and this book is one of the finest books on the subject out there. Let the sparks fly, and the anvil ring."
5,An excellent resource,"This book is an excellent resource, both for those going into the field, and also for those with an interest in learning more about blacksmithing. Every skill outlined in the book, is backed up with scads of historical information. This book was wonderfly written and a joy to read."
3,Good Book/ Blank Pages Not Pleasant,This is a very nice book with great information but many pages throughout book are blank or so faintly printed that are unreadable and make parts of book useless. Have ordered two separate copies trying to get one in complete readable condition but several pages are so faintly printed that they are beyond difficult to read. Be prepared for an imperfect book- the information provided is excellent if you can get past the missing pages. Amazon says to just keep returning the bad copies and getting refunds and to reorder to try again- but this requires multiple trips to UPS and frustration of waiting and hoping the next copy will be complete.
2,"ehhh, they can't all be winners","It was ok, but not what I expected. A mish mosh of plans with little supporting detail."
4,The What's Up Bar Compilation,"Let's go back, the What's up Bar was born in 1995 Paris, Bastille. Not only a normal bar with cokctails and happy-hours, the WUB was the club of the french touch house music with several dj's :Rork, Cyril K, Greg Gauthier and Sven Love.The WUB produced a compilation named ""Mo Dj's Under a Groove"", a discographical trylogy of the glory hours of the WUB with mythic dj's (Alex Gopher, Dj Beep, Sthephane Malka, Galliano ...) With the explosion of the french touch, the WUB gamble with young dj's as Olivier Portal and so well known ""Playin' 4 the City"".The WUB disappeared and this compilation was born under What's Up Record Label.This album is a kaleidoscope of the french touch in it's different style: house, funky, hip-hop. To be continued."
1,Ecco Bella Original Organic Water-Free Herbal Body Lotion,"I am a loyalEcco Bella Original Organic Water-Free Herbal Body Lotion, Lemon Verbena, 8-Ounce Bottlecustomer. This product from the third-party vendor was inferior by all standards. It was obviously OLD, as the oil was separated and remained so throughout the use of the lotion. I will order Ecco Bella from reliable vendors from this point on."
1,Not good at all,"I love lemon verbena scented products, but this did not smell quite right...sort of artifical. Also I had a problem with a LOT of oil separating from the lotion. I shook it up, I stirred it, but it just wouldn't stay in solution. I will not purchase this product again, and I don't recommend it to others."
4,Most Hilarious and Interesting,"This book contains riddles made for children and adults alike. If you want to expand or exercise your mind, this is the book to do it with. Of course, some riddles are silly, but that is what makes this book splendid! Enjoy!"
3,Decent coverage of an often overlooked aircraft,"The Convair twins were not glamorous like the long-range propliners of the day, but author Nicholas Veronico provides a detailed overview of the development and service career of these faithful feederliners. I would have liked to have seen more interior shots of the aircraft, including period cockpit shots, but all that was provided was a drawing of a 240 cockpit. The only other cockpit shown was that of the recent Convair 5800 of Kelowna Flightcraft, and that is not representative of a typical Convair.The photo of the elusive Convair 110, the granddaddy of all Convairliners, was a pleasant surprise. Photos of this aircraft are rare, because it was broken up for scrap soon after the 240 was introduced."
3,Good reading!,"An excellent book on the Civil War, however there is one major disappointment. Mr. Axelrod's coverage on the Vicksburg Campaign is most disappointing. He barely brushed on the fact in his rush to concentrate on the Eastern Theater, mainly Chancellorville and Gettysburg. He failed to mention Benjamin Grierson's Raid through Mississippi, the fact that Grant fought and won five battles to reach the eastern city limits of Vicksburg and that during the siege, he beseiged the city and at the same time, kept Gen. Joe Johnston at bay. Nor did Mr. Axelrod mention the fact that Sherman's March Through Georgia was based on Grant's Vicksburg Campaign."
1,Complete Idiots Account,"Very disappointing. This is the usual ""virtuous north fighting to free the slave"" dribble which considering his excellent works on WWI and the Revolutonary War is uncharacteristically shallow. Perhaps the conflict has become so politicized that only the bravest meet it head on. This is a turkey. Avoid it at all cost."
4,Good product,"I purchased it for W580i. It fits tight and looks good. It is good value for the money. I wish it had proper cutouts for charge cable connection.Overall, good case for Ericsson."
5,A must have for Clay fans,This is such a great handbook. I laughed till I cried. I also loved the serious part at the end. Well worth the money!!
5,"A ""must have"" book","The ClayMate Handbook is a wonderful book that is lighthearted and fun to read over and over again. I loved reading it! From information about some of the Clay message boards, to tips on how to ""Clayvert"" someone, this book contains everything a person needs to know about being a Claymate. It was really great to read Nicmike's hilarious recaps again, too. I've grown really fond of ""The Shirt Tug Song""--it's catchy! For some reason, I can't get that song out of my head. I would highly recommend this book to everyone."
3,Hardly worth 15 dollars,"For the longest time, I wanted to buy the Claymate Handbook. The 4.5 star rating and great reviews from my fellow Claymates only raised to my expectations.However, when I actually received it, I was a little annoyed. Not only is the book very short, it is not very interesting. It has some fun Top 10 lists and Trivia questions, however, most of it focuses on the Clay forums over the web as well as random letters to Clay.Don't get me wrong, I love my Aiken boy, I own all his CDs and went to all of his concerts, but I don't think that book was as good as I was led to believe. I read the first half, skimmed through the second half and never touched it again.In conclusion, it's good if you're the ""forum"" type of Claymate. Other than that, save your money for an upcoming tour."
3,A very basic set of materials-,"This is good if it is your first year and you need materials to pad what you already have. I found that I made better vocabulary lists and activities on my own and this is my first year teaching Macbeth. There are very basic questions and a limited number of vocabulary words for each act.The vocabulary words are limited and not very well chosen. They are used in context in an effort to get the student to figure them out, but the context they are used in is so limited that it is of little help."

5,Moisture Happy Hands,"Love the smell, the way it feels on my hands, and most of all it's water free. Keeps my hands moisturized for a long time and the smell of Lavendar is just right. Would recommend these lotions to anyone. Keeps hands very soft. I'm hooked and will not use any other product but Ecco Bella Lotions!"
2,bottom fell out,"Not a very good product!!!!! When you let the thinner set in the pail for a lenght of time, the bottom eats away the seam. I found it better to go down to the local hardware store and buy one of their mixing buckets!"
1,Love the look,I could not get these shoes to stay on my feet either. It is something with the way the band is placed. I regretably had to send them back.
3,Baked Alaska,"Made in EU in 2000, Serial# ZCRCD-46, Playing Time 64:25Let me start by saying that, considering this is an ""official"" release, the recording quality is fairly bad.The line-up on the album is the same as on their ""The Pack"" album, and consists of Bernie Marsden(G), Robert Hawthorn(V), John Marter(D), Brian Badhams(B) and Don Airey(K).The 12 tracks on the album are: Headlines, Woman Like You, Can't Let Go, Run With The Pack, Where Did They Go, The Sorcerer, Don't Say It's Over, The Thing, I Really Want To Know, Help Yourself, Schoolgirl, S.O.S.The performances of each band member, particularly Marsden and Airey, are interesting, and the renditions are pretty faithful, minus the polish available when recording in a studio. It's an interesting document, but for the die-fan only.If you're curious about this but don't have their 2 studio albums, get ""Bronze Years"" instead: it contains 17 of the 19 tracks from 1984's ""Heart Of The Storm"" and 1985's ""The Pack""."
4,"These are awesome, but the quality is very inconsistent","I order these pretty regularly and love them. Because I can't find them in my area and go through a lot, I order 5 pound bulk packages from Amazon. They arrive in a timely manner and the package is always in good condition, but the product can range from hard-as-a-rock to so sticky that they come out in one big ball. I'll keep ordering them because I don't have another option at the moment, but I wish they had better quality control."
1,Was not fresh when I got it,These were hard and didn't taste good when I got them. And they are not eligible for return either. Was a waste of money.
1,Hard Candies,I've tried several different gummy products including the mini frogs and they are So HARD! I couldn't enjoy them. I do not recomend Haribo products
3,Good Gummis But For The High Price Was Expecting More,"After I got the techno gummis along with this I was amazed at how unique the techno gummis taste was and was expecting about the same thing with the mini-frogs, but except for their marshmallow bellies the mini-frogs were just the same as the gummi bears you get at the store and in all to me they were like the shark gummis I can get at the convenient stores as well. The bag is humongous and holds a great quantity so kudos for that but still I felt a little cheated that for this price I just got what amounted to five pounds of marshmallow gummi bears, and while I loved the techno gummis and have ordered another bag seeing as how my family and I have almost finished the bag I really doubt I will reorder this again unless the price goes a little more down to a reasonable price for this usual treat that's pretty much available at almost every store...."
1,Stale...,"Purchased the frogs, ate a few to find I couldn't even chew them. My 2 year old son can't even eat them.. I was very disppointed because I love the gummy frogs... But they were stale."
2,gummies taste old,"I am a big fan of Haribo gummy, and when I saw the opportunity to get the frogs on sale, I jumped right to it. To my disappointment, the gummies tasted old and stale. It was very hard to chew and did not feel/taste fresh at all. Unfortunately, I will have to go through 5 pounds worth..."
2,Gummy frogs,"These gummies are very cute but I wasn't happy with the taste or the strange odor they left in the plastic packaging that they came in. I ordered these to use in a party favor but almost did not use them for those reasons. Kids seem to really like them, though. I definitely would not order them again."
2,"Haribo Gummy Candy, Mini Frogs, 5-pound bag",I've purchased this same product before and it was great but the second time around it was barely tolerable. It has a smell that one wouldn't expect from a candy product. I don't think I'll be buying one this size again...
2,Gummi Frogs,"I figured I would give these a try based on the other reviews, but I really did not care for them at all. I'm sticking with the original bears and cherries."
1,Not Good,"This product is hard and has no flavor, would not recommend. Checked freshness date and product has 8 months left on it but they are just not good"
3,"Gummy Frogs, OK","All in all i would describe these gummies as different from haribo brands, and definitely decent quality, but nothing to be a die hard fan of.I found the product to be chewy, similar in nature to a relatively fresh bag of standard haribo gummies, with the 'marshmallow' bottom slightly softer.The flavors were mostly indiscernible and the product seemed to stay fresh even while in an open bag over a 2 week period in my office.Grapefruit (pink) slices are greatraspberries/black berries are good and a different productregular gummies are always a hit.I think this may be my last 'experiment' into the haribo brand for a while. I was expected some better flavor, but not good enough for my tastes."
2,Half baked,"This is the second 'Bagman' novel I have read. The first one was okay a little over the top and illogical, this one however goes way beyond that it's almost a comic book without the pictures. It's the kind of book you skim through instead of reading. The plot (such as it is) is silly, the characters more cardboard then creative. I can't recommend this book to anyone unless you have nothing else to read."
1,Worst Tribute Album Ever,Do not buy this. Unless you're big time into cheezy synth music. It's stuff like this that makes rating systems invent a negative scale. Seriously. Buy Sun Kil Moon - Tiny Cities if you want a good tribute album to modest mouse.
5,Not your average caesar dressing,"I love this salad dressing! I used to be able to find it in various grocery stores in Richmond, Va, but not anymore! I make it with apple cider vinegar instead of white vinegar, use some to marinate chicken breasts, and add the chicken to the salad, along with cut up bacon, fresh croutons and freshly grated parmesan. Sometimes we skip the croutons and have it in a tortilla instead. I've made it often for friends who just had a baby and they always rave about it. It's a shame I can't find it locally."
2,Found better by looking in a different place,"My goal is to point out some of the problems I've had with this light and also suggest what I think is a grat alternative.I've tried to use this light a couple times and was never happy with it. The light didn't stay in position, seemed to occasionally get in the way of my hands, and frequently blocked my view of the screen. Nothing was a showstopper but I wanted to get rid of the annoyances if possible.Then I tried a new reading light:Mighty Bright XtraFlex2 Light (Silver). It throws a very even, very white light at two intensities. Batteries will run it for over 20 hours. The neck is stiff enough to keep the light were you put it. Best of all it attaches to your book with nice wide and padded jaws.It took me about a minute to realize that all these benefits could be used with my netbook by clipping the light to the slide of the display. It's the best I've seen."
2,Limited help.,I have a few complaints but really it's not worth discussing them all. The beam is too hot and too narrow to allow this thing to illuminate more than a tiny bit of the keyboard.
2,Great in concept....Poor in reality,"Why do I get the feeling that some of these later reviews were written by Kensington people? The fact is, this light has some unique features that most USB lights don't, including an On/Off switch and two brightness levels. However, that doesn't come close to overcoming the drawbacks. First of all, the price is way too high for what you are getting. Also, the brightness difference between four and eight LEDs is negligible. But the biggest flaw in this light, by far, is that the flexible arm is not NEARLY strong enough to support the weight of the lamp. I have had to resort to clamping the arm to the side of my monitor, which is just plain ridiculous. For the price they are getting, they should have produced a more durable product."
5,I love my laptop light !,"I love this light ! I was always in the dark with my laptop, since I sit in various places, often in the living room. I didn't know anyone made these little direct lights that plug into a computer port and run on the laptop power. You never replace the bulbs. My light's arm is flexible and is very useful. The light is bright enough for me. It has 8 small lights and can be dimmed to 4. The other letters here don't like the light, I would not be without it. I love it."
1,BEWARE: It doesn't come with the pictured base,"The main photograph with the write up shows the 33120 in a round black base. The base isn't included. What you get is shown in the second picture, just the light on a short gooseneck arm and a USB connector."
1,Worst product ever from Kensington,"I just bought one of this yesterday and was so dispointed since then. The goose neck is so weak, it kept falling off from it setup position. 8 LEDs light is not in any way brighter than regular 5-buck-1-LED-notebook light. Paid 20 bucks for this item and it was the worst investment ever. I could find better one with one one LED light for 2 bucks on Ebay. Never gonna by any product from Kensington any more."
3,FlyLight Only OK,"This light is nifty, however the beam spread should be wider...it only lights half the keyboard."
3,Well made but the light is too concentrated,"Considering this product has been on the market for quite some time, it's unfortunate there hasn't been a redesign to improve it. The problem is that most of the light concentrates in a fairly small area of your keyboard. In other words, the LEDs are in a tight cluster and that results in too narrow a focus of light. Other competing products have the LEDs in a longer array and that works better. Too bad they're not as well made as the Kensington product."
2,"""C-"" grade at best","The neck is too weak - does not adequately support the light in useful positions, where it would actually illuminate most of keyboard.It is MUCH OVERPRICED here! It is about 20% less at one retail chain, but even that is too much money for product of this quality.I will keep it, but I will have to use something to fashion a tiny ""lampshade"" -- otherwise it keeps shining annoyingly in my eyes or reflect off the screen. Of course this will add weight, making it even more ""floppy"" and ""bendy"", so I will have to attach it somehow to the screen/lid.BOTTOM LINE: if you hope to get something of quality for $20 here -- forget it! It's no better than $3 or $5 lights."
4,works great,"the glare from the lights them selfs are a little distracting, but over all it works well."
4,Lights up 80% of Keyboard,for the price it gets the job done even taht it only lights 80% of the keyboard
3,Kensington 33120 FlyLight,"It lights up my keyboard really well. I especially like that it has a on/off switch, plus low and high selections. It could be slightly longer. The price could be brought down a tad as compared with other lights of its caliber."
2,Great concept but poor function.,"We were really disappointed in this product. The idea is great and, initially, it did a great job of lighting the keyboard. After about 3 or 4 days, the lights started to flash and burn out. We now have three lights that don't function at all and 2 that flicker all the time. Did we get a defective light or is the craftsmanship poor?"
3,bright~,"Ive bought 3 of these and within a 6 months the first 2 work, but the plastic light cover has fallen off.You cant move it around a lot i guess."
3,Okay and not to sturdy,"Got this to use my laptop outside at night. The light is just okay and the flexible shaft does droop after a bit and you tend to find that you have to readjust it periodically. Like I said it is okay for what it is supposed to do which is see the keyboard in the dark, just don't move around much and plan on spending a few minutes to get it in a position it stays in for a while. I don't think I would buy it again if I knew what I know now."
2,Top Heavy,"The light is bright and Very easy to use, Just plug and play, but its so top heavy that it wont stay up at all unless you have it hang over the laptop screen. However If you have your laptop in your vehicle like I do, It don't stay still period even if it's supported by the screen. So I'm not to happy with it."
1,"WILTING, NODDING, SAGGING, will just not hold its position","The flexible connection from the USB port to the light is just not strong enough to hold the light in any position. Hard to use when it sags out of place.So, it's a waste of money. Fortunately, not a lot of money."
1,don't bother,"the light is brite, but the arm is too short and will not stay up when bent into position."
2,Bulbs start to flicker,"I was very happy with the Kensington USB light until after about 20 hours of usage several of the eight LED lights began to flicker. It started as just one light and then progressed into three of the eight lights. The flickering is annoying, enough to make me take the device apart to see if there is a loose connection. There isn't. It is just a flaw in the circuit board. I wouldn't recommend buying this product."
3,"""Nice Light""","I have only a couple bad thing to say about this light. First the picture is false because it came with know stand to hold it up. Second, the switch on it should be a twisting one right were the light and flex are connect. The little switch on the top will surely brake it a short time. Still good light for the price."
3,Where is the base?,Correct me if I am wrong but doesn't this picture show a base that the light is plugged into? This is the whole reason I bought the light but apparently the image is misleading.The light itself is great but useless to me without the base for it.
5,My wife loves it,My wife is a Paramedic. This light gives her the perfect amount of light to use her laptop and notes to complete her EMS reports without affecting the ambulance driver.
5,Great product,"This is a great light for travel. It has a switch with 3 settings: off, 4 LEDs, 8 LEDs."
4,Just What I Was Looking For,"The FlyLight is exactly what i was looking for. Perfect while working on my laptop at night in the living room without having to turn on an end-table lamp to see the keyboard. Also perfect for using the laptop while in bed.I do agree with other reviewers that if the light was diffused, the lighting would appear evenly distributed across the keyboard. However, you CAN still see the entire keyboard without the light being diffused. I have an HP Pavilion dv9000, which has a full size keyboard; I have NO problem seeing any of the keys. I also agree with the other reviewers that there really isn't much difference between the low and high light settings.My only concern is for the USB ports on the laptop; in general, USB ports can easily break after a lot of use and the cost to replace them can be excessive. While the light is very lightweight, I'd suggest that you hold the connection firm while adjusting the gooseneck...just as a precaution."
4,"Pleased overall, ""flexible gooseneck"" little TOO flexible",Absolutely worth the $20. Very handy to have. Totally happy with amount of light it gives off etc. Only complaint is that it doesn't hold it's position as well (or stiff?) as I might prefer.
3,laptop light,"trhe light works well bit is a little difficult to keep adjusted, also i wory about the presure on the usb port esspecially when you are bending the light around looking for that position that keeps the lite on enough of the keyboard while not making to much glare on the screen or shinning back into your eyes.however i still like it"
3,FlyLight USB Light,"So-so product, but ok for the $. Bought for my wife as a gift to help illuminate her laptop keyboard. While illumination is great (you can turn it outwards and it makes a passable reading lamp), the light is spread out and cannot be directed without blasting your field of vision along with the keyboard. Adjustable aperture would be helpful to reduce/eliminate the problem. Too much 'flood' and not enough 'spot'."
3,Slip and Slide,"This is a great idea, and very usefull, but it won't stay up it falls over even if u bend and twist and wrap it around the laptop it will not stay!"
3,flickers too much,"this is my second Kensington 33120. Advertised to last 100,000 hours,which would out live me. First one started Flickering after a month or two. Decided to get another ,and again,flickering........Id stay away from this brand."
1,Arm too weak,The arm is way too weak to support the light at almost every angle so you wind up spending more time tweaking the arm then you do performing the task at hand...Enough said!
1,Misrepresented,"This light looks nothing like the picture. There is no base, only a flexible stem with a light on one end and a USB plug on the other. The ""dimmer"" is just a switch with two levels of brightness."
2,"Good design, terrible reliability","I ordered one of these from Amazon just over a year ago. Within 2 months, 2 of the LEDs stopped working. They both affected the dim setting, making it too dim to be useful, while the bright setting was still too bright. Since the item was outside of Amazon's exchange timeframe, I went to Kensington and got a replacement. The replacement worked fine for about 6 months, when the first LED went out. A second one went out shortly thereafter. Now last week, another LED malfunction... one of the LEDs has now started flashing, which is very distracting. I expect it to go out completely sooner or later.I've had Kensington products in the past and have been pleased with them. But the FlyLight is too poorly constructed and unreliable to recommend."
1,Kensington 33120 computer light,"I needed a nightlight for my laptop that is mounted in my police car. When I hooked this light up, I quickly discovered that the USB connection was loose and unstable. I also discovered that the light could not hold up it's own weight and rotated downwards everytime i raised it up and bumped it a little. Sorry, but dont waste your money on this light. A sidenote however....Amazon quickly allowed me to return the light and then refunded the entire amount of the cost including postage. They also suppled a return label over the internet for the box it came in. One star for the light and FIVE STARS for Amazon!!"
2,Beam is too narrow,"I purchased this device so I can enjoy the keyboard lighting that my work Lenovo has built in yet lacking on my personal HP laptop. It's certainly bright enough, but the beam is so narrow it simply makes a bright spot in the middle of the keyboard. Take a lesson from laptop vendors who make built in keyboard lights; one lamp in the right spot is perfect. It simply needs to add a diffused lighting to the keyboard."
2,Partially satisfied,"I like the fact that this notebook light is light in weight, very flexible and convenient. But I had expected much more illumination than I got. It does help to see the keyboard when typing in dark, but that is all...nothing more."
4,Simply great !,A must for any portable owner who needs light in a darkest environment. The light beam covers just a part of the keyboard.
2,Defective Unit delivered - Referred to service center,"Purchased as a gift for Christmas 2012 from BigKitchen. Recipient reported the unit began sparking immediately upon being plugged in. Given the 3+ week delay between purchase from BigKitchen and realizing the unit was defective, BigKitchen was unable to provide a refund (check their return/exchange policies carefully before purchasing from BigKitchen). While the unit construction appears impressive, I have concerns as to the quality control of the Waring Blender and was expecially disappointed in the return/exchange terms of the BigKitchen retailer."
4,Un flic (1974),"According to some bloggers, this a new edition, made by Lions Gate, of ""Un flic"" (1974), the very last movie of French filmmaker Jean-Pierre Melville (""Bob le Flambeur"", ""L'armée des ombres"", ""Le cercle rouge""). Please correct title (""Dirty money"") and actors links, mistaken with ""Dirty money"" (1994). Maybe ""Un flic"" has not been unanimously appreciated by critics and the box office but there is no doubt that it is a superb film noir done by a genre master, plenty of melancholy. Full of remarkable sequences, such as the opening one, a bank hold-up filmed under the rain. Pay attention to Alain Delon playing the piano at Deneuve's night club. Excellent performance by Richard Crenna."
1,bad shipping,they used glass instead of plexi and shipped it three times and all three times the glass broke.
4,best one I found,"It's got enough power .cup is not big enough, and like other reviews it is a tall one. so take that into consideration"
1,Gone in 60 Seconds,"I looked at all of the machines listed on Amazon. I read the reviews. The Waring appeared to be the best though I worried a bit about the pretty plastic motor cover. It almost fakes chrome steel, and now I know why! I use hard frozen ice cream and like my malts thick. My machine may be ""faulty"" but it overheated and quit the third time I used it. The Amazon vendor is a pain in the six and Waring's talking machine recorded my message (to call back) around an hour ago. I'm looking for a commercial grade machine!"
1,Don't bother with this product,"The cup rests on a tiny ball and if you don't hold the cup against the miser by hand, the cup flies off. Nothing like half-made chocolate milkshake all over the kitchen! This is definitely a design flaw. Wait until it's corrected."
2,Easy Peel and Stick Application?,"I bought this because it said easy peel and stick application in the detail but when I got it, it was just the foam. Picture of the item is accurate."
4,"dynamic,powerful","2 words two decribe this i sould say another underrated dutiot montreal performence,though i give it 4 stars mostly because of the sound witch is pretty good but nothing like some of there other ones.the performence excels on every level its way better then alot of other versions and better than tilson thomos somewhat overrated version,i wish dutiot played the entire ballet,dont pass this one up espesially if you are a prokoviev fan like me,the final number is beutifully played and famous dance of the knights is awsome and tybalts death too the playing is amazing"
5,Beautiful,"I have been re-doing my bracelet and I really wanted a cross, and this one fits what I wanted exactly. It's so cute, and wonderfully displays my faith on my bracelet!"
5,Terrific companion to 'The Gift of Peace',"Whatever your exposure to the late Cardinal, you must admire his example of the Christian life. In the Gift of Peace, he invited us to walk beside him during his final months. In this volume, Spilly & Langford have artfully woven together extended excerpts from his homilies while Archbishop of Chicago. The book is divided into chapters identified by the Stations of the Cross -- a device that both illuminates the Cardinal's own words, as well as the putting the Way of the Cross into a contemporary context, thus reminding us that the Cross itself is as real today as it was two thousand years ago.If you loved Cardinal Bernadin as we in Chicago did, you will of course love this book. But even if this is your first encounter, you will come to know him like a dear friend -- and learn much from his humility, his prayerfulness, his humiliation and exoneration, and his very public suffering and passing."
5,Must-read for those considering VNS--and their doctors,"If you or someone you love suffers from severe, treatment-resistant depression, you'll find hope in this book, and in the treatment it describes. In his compassionate, plain-spoken style, Charles Donovan tells you exactly what to expect at every turn, as if he were describing the process to a friend. If you're not sure if VNS therapy is right for you, this book will undoubtedly help you make the right decision. Reading Charles Donovan's story will also help you realize that you're not alone."
4,Review of Vaginal Nerve Stimulation,The book is well written and describes depression well. Depression sometimes does not respond to drugs or ECT. The VNS can help greatly with these patients. The process of implantation and how the VNS works is described well. This book should be of great value to depressed patients who have been unable to get effective treatment for their illness. It also describes how a support team will be formed by your doctor and the manufacturer of the VNS.VNS -Vaginal Nerve Stimulation
3,mixed feelings,"As a fellow depression sufferer, I was glad to see that the author found relief after all those years of lost life & time. I was thrilled to learn that there is another treatment for what we suffer. I was angry to find that it is not available now to the rest of us. He was very lucky to be included in the study. The cost was also daunting. I am glad for him but sad for me."
5,Superb style!,"This book was on a recommended list for a grad course in Analysis (we followed Rudin's book) that I took several years ago. I was absolutely captivated by the introduction, and the great introductory sections of each chapter. I am not a mathematician, but I have always loved mathematics (esp. analysis and topology). For me to remember this book and the author is testimonial enough. Because of such books, my dream is to go back to school a few years from now to pursue a degree in math.I would give this book 6 stars!"
2,I wouldn't recommend this book to other people...,"which is why I'm giving it only 2 stars. I enjoy reading Indian writers, but this was the most disappointing book by an Indian writer that I have read. I went right from ""The Blue Bedspread"" to ""Shiva Dancing"" by Bharti Kirchner, and it was such a great relief to read another evocative, beautifully written, story about India. ""The Blue Bedspread"" had a few moments of clarity and good storytelling, but overall I found it difficult to plod through--and I found myself scanning through pages."
1,"bad, pretty much bad....","Well, this book is pages and pages of disappointment and boredom. The storyline is vague. In fact if the plot is not important then the language and imagery should have been. But that too is really poor. Maybe Jha should read some more, for his creative talents and writing skills seem non-existent. Some chapters of this book are vague. The whole thing in the end leaves you wondering what was this all about. My advice--- run a hundred miles from this one...."
2,boil it down to some short stories,"This book was ok. There are some really nice moments of writing--evocating, tender, clever, thoughtful. The structure was interesting--more so than a straightforward linear narrative. Some of the gaps he leaves enhance the text, while others are merely puzzling. The conceit of writing to his niece is appealing, as are the glimpses of Calcutta . However, his treatment of the (approaching tired) topic of incest was thin and boring, and added *nothing* to the book. Maybe he thought he was being daring, but he wasn't. (Surely *someone* can come along and treat this topic in an interesting fashion?!) Overall, the material in this book might be better served by cutting out the dross and turning it into a collection of short stories. This would trim away some of the contrivance. I can't really recommend this book--let's see what #2 looks like."
2,"bad writing,good networking","The blue bedspread is definitely the death of the written word and no amount of window dressing and networking can change that. The story --- there is really none --- is contrived, the situations trumped up, the characters nameless zombies. This is the real Y2k bug of a book! I was so grossly disappointed and bored by the book that I made it a point to read every word of it just to figure out what the critics saw in it. Well, either the few reviewers are the Tom Hanks, for believe me this entire effort is amateurish and bad. Maybe the subcontinet has produced good authors like , Salman Rushdie, Vikram Seth and Amitav Ghosh. Jha certainly is not even a fraction as talented. However if you want to make sense of nonsense, you could try your patience here. For me this required two aspirins to get over...."
1,"disappointing,overhyped,poorly written","I had gone through the reviews of this book before I purchased it. It seems that either people hate it or a few like it. But when I started going through it, I realised that it took a lot of patience to wade though the book. I could not make sense of most of it. Maybe that is what the author wanted. Or maybe the only thrill one got out of the book was the feeling that one had done a difficult and tiring journey! Phew! Once it was over, you could congratulate yourself that you had managed to last the journey! And you could even find some bright spots during what is certainly a cumbersome book. I feel the author should read more. Maybe read authors like saul Bellow and Mark Twain, Hemingway and Salman Rushdie to know what real writing is about. I think the critics have been too generous or ignorant of what the book is about. At least all I can conclude is that this is poorly written !"
1,its the pits!,"...This book has got no plot, no sentence structure, no logic. Its an amateurish effort from a person who has not read much either. I wish book reading should not die out. But if there are a hundred more of this sort of books, the readers r surely going to stop reading! And that is certainly not a good prospect...."
5,captivating story,"I know that this is Raj Kamal Jha's first book, and after reading it, I know I'll be a fan of his beautiful prose for many years to come. Jha tells the story of a brother and sister with tenderness and compassion and, above all, urgency. Once I started this book, I only put it down once--briefly--because I couldn't imagine what the final moment of truth would reveal. I admit, I was somewhat disturbed, but I think that's a natural reaction to this subject matter. After a few minutes, though, I realized that Jha's startling conclusion makes this a story that will stay with me for quite some time--I would recommend it to anyone who loves a carefully crafted story and who can appreciate a new talent when they read one."
3,Bizarre Tale,"This story definitely qualifies for the term ""bizarre tale"". From beginning to end; it's unique & mysterious. These qualities keep you reading up until the most suspenseful page of all- the last. However, the last page leaves something to be desired.At times this tale that is woven for a baby of a sister, is hard to grasp. Other times things seem to come into focus. Through out all of the stories of sisters, brothers, mothers & fathers, the ending is looming and is what the reader anxiously awaits- in order to get some clarification on events. Unfortunately, I felt that clarification never did come.I enjoyed the book, but was extremely dissapointed with the ending. I felt like I was left hanging, waiting for answers that never came. I don't think I would recommend this book to anyone. The only reason I gave it three stars was because I did enjoy the stories so much and the suspense. But overall whatever the author was trying to pull off did not work for this reader."
2,"I WANTED TO LIKE IT, BUT IT WAS WAY TOO CONFUSING","I read many of the reviews on this book, and while it has been well received, it was difficult and confusing to read, way too disjointed for me. There was no cohesive quality to this book, and yet some of the writing was very beautiful. In the end, I'm left wanting something better written than what this was."
3,Quick read,"Well, many have trashed this novel but I can't say I disliked it at all. I thought it was an enjoyable 1-2 day read and I can't complain. I do feel that comparisons to Raymond Carver are in order. The author's style is slow, methodical and I hate to say it ""lyrical"". It was a good change of pace and I would recommend it as part of the new Indian author scene: Arhudhati Roy, Mohsin Hamid and Akhil Sharma among others."
1,"corny,boring,confusing...","This book is difficult to read and is pure pretense. I believe that Jha is a new writer, but I guess he has slipped up badly. People outside India may make some sense out of the whole thing, but for me this was pure disappointment. There are structural problems as well as a problem of credibility in the entire story; Such subjects require more senstivity. I think Jha should put in more effort in his next book as well as be more honest and less showy."
1,"pretentious, boring, stupid",What a ghastly book! Dreadful story and overly written. The only character worth remembering is the family's faithful housemaid. And the ending - puhleeze! Like you couldn't see the big secret from ten miles away. I didn't want to give it even one star; maybe amazon should rethink their rating system.
2,Disappointing,"I really wanted to ""get"" this book, however, the author failed to deliver. The inconsistencies are hard to overcome and his writing style is disjointed. Bonding with the characters is futile as they are bland and lifeless. I must say, certain passages were riveting but it wasn't enough to carry the book."
1,Affected and insincere,"This story of incest just doesn't work because it is artificial, the characters are ersatz, and the author seems to have introduced situations just to fill the pages. There is no redemptive power in the story and the writing. One of the low points of Indian English writing."
1,"corny,boring,bad!!","I would probably be the last person to trash a book, especially from a first timer. Yet this one deserves to be reviewed honestly for an attempt is being made to redefine Indian writing by sheer publicity and not on the strenght of the product. In this case advance publicity about a handsome international advance was leaked out so that there was curiousity all around. But did the book do justice to this advance and the publicity?? Good God NO!! For one thing Raj kamal has no story telling abilities. You can go through the book or maybe even the first twenty pages to judge that. Maybe his stint as a journalist has killed it. Here there are attempts to be sensational-- Incest in many forms; To be falsely arty-- few names given to places and people; To sound profound-- few images thrown here and there. And so on. On the whole very very disappointing fare. Somebody has said this is bad writing. I agree a hundred percent!"
2,Wonderful Sound - Lacking Excitement,"I was expecting a wonderful set when I bought Solti and Chicago's Beethoven Cycle. What I got was one of the best sounding sets of the symphonies BUT at the same time one of the most boaring sets. I cannot even listen to the Eroica Solti takes it so slowly; it sounds dead. The Lenore Overture No. 3 is beautiful, but also long and slow. The pastoral sounds like the orchestra is half alseep. There are some good symphonies: Nos. 1,2,5, and 7, but even these are not to par with the amazing Szell recordings or the Karajan cycles. Both of those capture the true power of the symphonies both with great sound and gusto. Solti, on the other hand, sounds like he is tired of conducting some of the world's greatest music!"
3,"Great sound, but performance?","After receiving Solti's Beethoven set I felt a little dissapointed in this cycle. While the sound quality is at a very high standard the playing itself is a little lacklustre - lacking the enthusiasm which so characterises other Solti/CSO recordings, it is too restrained and polite. While Solti's interpretations are valid I feel that this set is not competetive with the likes of Bernstein, Szell and Karajan - it does not offer anything really new. But on the other hand if you're after sound quality then I would give this set 5 stars, all of the recordings are naturally balanced and are very clear, as usual by London/Decca records."
5,Frighteningly Freakish!,"Isn't it great when a great classic film leads you to an even greater work of classic literature? I've always been a huge fan of Tod Browning's Freaks, but had never been aware of the background surrounding the story until recently. I tracked down a copy as soon as possible, and was delighted to find it three times as horrific and twisted! There is just something about misshapen freaks on a murderous rampage that tickles me pink. You won't find a better book written these days!"
4,Nice big tote,The tote was big enough to hold two beach towels and other stuff and it has a zipper so the sand doesn't get in to the bag. You can wash this easily too.Good buy if you are looking for a big tote with a zipper.
4,Mr Mead stikes again,"Those familiar with David Mead's brand of dazzling, intelligent pop will not be disappointed. The British influence is obvious, but his melancholy harmonies and angelic voice lift these tunes beyond that reference point.The shame is, hardly anyone will hear this album beyond those in the know. That's okay, it's our secret."
5,why has this gone out of print,"It seems impossible that a collection of stories as ground breaking as these could disappear from the bookshelves, but here it is. I came on to find out about ordering a copy but found the publisher was out! Then let me say, having read it a few times already that while In the Heart of the Heart of the Country gets and deserves much praise in this collection, The Pederson Kid is MASTERFul in its language, pacing and style. Order of Insects also is rumination as short story. I am in love with this book and like your true love, it will always be there."
3,"There's a lot of brilliant writing here, but too much work is required to get to it.","It's kind of like eating crab legs. The difficulty level isn't as high as Ulysses but a lot higher than Dubliners--so let's say slightly higher than Portrait of the Artist. However, Joyce delivers more rewards. So do Beckett and Faulkner, who are a couple of other writers who I thought of when I read this book. My main problem was that I kept losing my concentration and having to read the same passages over and over again, so I'd spend an hour stuck on the same page. The lack of cohesion between sentences encouraged my mind to wander, even though each individual sentence was clear and well-written. My favorite story was ""Order of Insects"" because the writing was so lucid and beautiful."
1,HORRIBLE,"Cheapest guitar ever made. Did not work at all! Emailed asking for a return address, got an email back asking what was wrong and they tried to send me new strings. When I replied back that we didnt want new strings, it wouldnt fix the problem, I never heard from them again."
5,Wonderful collection,This is a great book of Christian poetry. For Christians and non Christians alike there is inspiration for everyone. I enjoy reading poetry and as a Christian believer I have longed for a good poetry book. I need not look any further than this large collection compiled by Al Bryant. It is simply the best Christian poetry selection out there. It is a little hard to find but it is worth the effort. I think the paper back edition is somewhat easier to find.
1,So gross I can't believe they're made by Haribo,"I ADORE Haribo, so was very surprised at how terrible I found these to be. Both the texture and flavor leave much to be desired -- this was probably the first bag of candy I've ever thrown away. I'll just have to stick to my Haribo standbys, I suppose."
4,Great Candy,"They are like a hollowed out Nib with a soft creamy skittles type center with 2 colors... very cool, addictive, and not the best for the teeth"
2,reminds me of fruit-roll-ups,"i love everything by haribo, or i thought i did, which is why i took the chance on this candy. i grew up eating haribo gummies and they are the best! (more chewy and better flavor than other brands), but pico-balla definitely has more of a ""fruit-roll-up"" taste and texture than i expected. i was hesitant to try it (at the expense of other haribo (coke or cherry gummies)), but, to be fair, it tastes and feels like how it looks (if you imagine a moderately firm creamy candy surrounded by fruit-roll-up)."
2,It's a Texture Thing,"What a different texture than the other Haribo candies. A little like gummy chalk? yeah. That's it. Gummy chalk.Although I didn't enjoy them, tastes differ around the world...."
2,Not so ggod,My kids were fascinated by the cheerful colors and asked me to buy these - but then they did not like it
3,"Sturdy, well built, but very difficult to adjust for a full tilt","Excellent, sturdy construction. Ankle ratchets great for average size, but they couldn't be tightened enough to secure a petite (4'10"") lady's ankles. She had to wrap her ankles in towels. Also, re-hanging the table swing to adjust for a full tilt and inversion was a KNUCKLE-BUSTER and too difficult for a woman. It requires partial disassembly (unbolting). I am a 5'10"" 185# male and was unable to get a full tilt without using the frame to push/pull myself around to a full, vertical inversion. If you never have to adjust the table, it is great. If the users have to adjust frequently, I'd definitely look for another table. The assembly instructions required some guesswork."
3,Great table for the price,"The Inversion Table is just what I wanted in ease of putting it together and ease of use.You actually have the option of dismantling it enough to store it out of sight but it is probably more practical to find a permanent loaction for it.The feature where it gently brings you back upright is lost on me,, I have to use my side rails and pull myself back upright but it is easy enough to do and not a deterrent whatsoever."
5,Great Table at an amazing price!!,The most comfortable and quality built table I have been on in this price range. I would recommend it to anyone and actually gave one to my parents.
4,Great Product Overall,"Brought this table based on price (Amazon's was by far the best) and ratings. The table was easy to assemble, operate and adjust. The materials are very high quality, which means that it should last your lifetime under normal conditions.The only problem encountered was with the ankle anchoring system. The ratchet works fine but it puts excessive pressure on my achilles tendon and hanging becomes increasingly uncomfortable as time passes. Hanging for more than 4-5 minutes actually becomes painful. As a powerlifter, there is more mass packed onto my frame than the average person. To be fair, this may be part of the problem?!? My solution has been to add additional wrapping around the ankles.Other than the anchoring, this is a great product that should last forever."
4,Inversion Table,"The table works well. It has different levels of inversion, so you can slowly work your way to total inversion. The only thing that I do not like is there is a strap to adjust the level of inversion. It is not very user friendly; however, for the price it is the best."
4,Bad Assembly instructions,"They have Bad Assembly instructions, descriptions are not clear, lack diagrams, pictures are not helpfull.I am a contractor and assemble things a lot, but good insructions are essential, score 3 out of 10.The parts are of very good qualty though, I think it will be good if I can get it together."
4,LifeGear Deluxe Inversion Table,After reading many reviews and doing price comparisions I settled on this product. I got fast shipping as always. This table for the money is well worth the purchase price. I am using this table to help stablize a bulging disk in my lower back. The table was easy to asemble and operate. I am sure I will get many years of use from it because of how well it is made. I would recommend this table to those who consider price to value.Thanks
3,Wrong Inversion Table Delivered,"I ordered this inversion table from Amazon last week. On the plus side, I received it very fast for such a large heavy item. On the down side, they sent the wrong one. I received model 75161 - instead of this model 75114 - which is entirely the wrong one and looks like an older model that no one sells anymore. I can only speculate that their shipper is trying to dump the old models hoping no one will notice, but I could be wrong.I realize this isn't a fair review of the product itself, but i wanted to warn anyone who might have also received the wrong item. I'll update and correct it when I receive the correct item from Amazon (aka their shipper)."
3,It works,It works as stated but I don't use it much. If you have acid reflux it is not smart to hang inverted a lot.
4,Inversion Table,"This inversion table is very well built. It has sturdy construction and is very stable when you are using it. I like how the adjustments are changeable according to the height of each individual. My husband had broken his back two times and has bulging disc, and this table helps to seperate the vertebra and allow the disc to ease back in place. We are very pleased with this table."
4,I like my Treo 680,"I have had the phone a month, and I really like it. It does everything I want it to, including organizer and calendar, as well as holding and displaying PDF, Word, and Excel docs.It DOES take a while to learn to use the features, and I have to admit there are probably some I still don't know.BTW, it comes with all the accessories you need, including a car charger, headset and usb cable for the computer.I would recommend it."
4,Good phone with PDA capabilities,"I have been a Palm PDA user for years and decided to get a smart phone. I wanted to keep my Palm programs so I bought a Palm Treo. I bought the 680 because I wanted to change cell phone carriers from Verizon (doesn't get good reception in my geographic area) to AT&T/Cingular. I have owned the phone for about 4 months and have been quite pleased. It is easy to use, compact, and allows me to keep scheduling, contacts, phone, etc. in one device. My one complaint is the battery life, which is relatively short. It has been improved since the upgrades that were available last month. Other than battery life, I haven't had any problems that other users have described."
5,Review of BlackBerry Pearl Phone and supplier,"The delivery was problematic and hopefully fully documented in the archives of Amazon. Once I got the pearl I started having fun with it. Besides a couple of times when it froze on me and I had to hard re-set it by taking out the battery, everything else is superb. I compared it to the iphone and I believe the BlackBerry concept as presented in the Pearl is better, nicer and smaller.Thanks"
3,go for the 750!,"good looking little think, lots of features, powerful, those are the pros. Cons, it is not insurable through Cingular, network reception can be flaky on the 680, high learning curb for features, low compatibility with existing software. Basically you need to buy more software for full music player compatibility, transfering your documents from pda to actual windows apps, using your own ringtones, and basically anything utilizing a media file is rendered useless unless it is the correct mp3 file. come on people, your palm! Cingular service and coverage is out of this world, highly recommend this carrier with 5 plus stars."
4,Don't trust the preview samples,"All song ""previews"" except one are wrong; they are most definitely not Django Walker! Go to http://www.djangowalker.com/audio.html for better previews. Six Trips Around the world is a great CD, very much like his first, very definitely Django (unlike the previews)."
1,Look's stupid,"This must be the must stupid piece of junk i ever saw. NOT MUCH STORAGE and don't put your system on it. It can be easy to push over ""no grip"".If I were you I would save my money!!"
1,Look's stupid,This must be the must stupid piece of Junk i ever say. Not mush storage and dont put system on it easy to push over by any one even your dog.
3,probalbly,this thing would probably be good is u were and only child but if u had bros or sisters they would easily tip it over so put it next to a crorner and u would have to have a small room bacause if u have a big room u should get a big shelf remember small is for small.
4,Marathon Industries 00003 13 inch Flat Free Tire,The tire itself is 100% of what we ordered and needed.My only complaint is the delivery service. It took about 10 days before it was put in the mail and then it took another 17 days before it was delivered. Unacceptable in this day and age.
4,no more flats,Everytime I wanted to use wheelbarrow the tire was low or flat. This product ended all that
3,"Review of ""Building a Dune Buggy""","When I bought this I was expecting some information on building a dune buggy (sand rail) type of vehicle. At first I was disappointed in this book. But after reading it became more interested. This book may not help me with the sand rail type of dune buggy but there were a lot of infomation on wiring, engine selection, and other bits of information helpful to building a dune buggy whether or not it is a sand rail. I recommend this book to anyone but would be more helpful to those who are building a baja bug from a beetle."
2,Too Euro-centered,"This would be a fine book for building a traditional Buggy in Europe, a large part of the book is concerned with sourcing parts in England. Here in the Northwest USA, building a traditional 70's style buggy is still within the reach of the average Joe. Parts can be scrounged, swapped, or made if you're building like Bruce Meyers did. And the more advanced 21st century buggies made to run hard and race offroad are barely mentioned."
5,Great!,This is a great resource for breaking down the books of the bible for teaching. Excellent maps and timelines included.
4,Very Helpful for Teaching About the Bible,"I'm a youth pastor and I purchased this book in hopes of finding some maps to help my students better understand the background context of the bible.I was very pleased with this book because in addition to the maps, it also has lots of great charts and visuals of the tabernacle, temple, ancient cities, etc, AND had a page on each book of the Bible with an outline/major themes to boot! On top of all of that, everything in the book is made to be reproduced; simply put it on the copier and go - no worries about copyrights!The only thing that could have made the book better would have been some more detailed outlines of the various Bible books, and maybe some rough biographies of some of the major figures.But I'm not complaining! It is a great resource and well worth the price. I highly recommend it!"
3,Not quite what the title says,"This book purports to include all the charts from the NIV Study Bible, but it does not. It leaves out the chart of Biblical covanents, for instance. Also, the table of contents in incomplete. The book has the parables and the miracles of Jesus, as well as many maps, but does not list them or give page numbers. You have to thumb through the book to find them. What it does have is good, but the omissions and lack of easy access to the material make it harder to use than it should be."
4,Great resource for teachers,"Resources like this are great for teachers to give to other teachers, which is how I used this product -- to reward a group of teacher-trainees."
3,Great speakers yet very short lived!,"I purchased these speakers a year and a half ago. They were great speakers for the first year. I was very pleased with the sound for the reasonable price. These speakers set 10' back under my back patio, well away from the Texas elements. Other than maybe the heat. I had to purchase new speakers recently due to both speakers had been torn. Before the speakers split they were not that bad. I would just expect more than a year. I am going to try another brand and hope to get some longevity out of them this time. I probably would not buy Dual's again based on quality."
4,This well written novel will keep you engaged,"This is only the second novel by Mr. Sanford that I have read and I give it four stars as it was well written and certainly kept my interest. LaChaise goes into a psychopathic rage when he is released from prison; he gathers friends to help him waste the police that killed his wife and sister during their attempted robbery of a credit union. He vows to not only kill the four policemen that he holds responsible but all their families. With information from a policeman that he is blackmailing, LaChaise is always a step ahead of Police Captain Davenport.Author al-Qaeda Strikes Again"
5,A thrilling read,"Sudden Prey is one of the best and most fast-paced mysteries I have read this year. Lucas Davenport and his team are on a man-hunt which quickly turns into a war between the good guys and the bad guys. The suspense is intense all the way through, and the book is un-putdownable. It is a book in John Sandford's Prey-series, but one does not have to have read all the previous novels to be able to really enjoy this. Do not read this book if you have things to do, you will not be able to do anything else but read! Highly recommendable."
1,Very twisted,"This was my fourth Sandford novel and I have tried to give him a chance. In the first two, I found Lucas to be appalingly sexist and disliked him immensely. After reading this one and ""Winter Prey,"" I have decided I will spend no more time reading Sandford. Stephen King is a pussycat compared to this guy. I just find these novels to be increasingly twisted and disturbed. I suppose there are people out there like these folks but in this case I would have to say ignorance is bliss on my part. It disturbs me that someone would think as Lucas does and that any women would put up with him. Time better spent elsewhere...."
4,A Fun Little Romp In Revenge,"This being the first of my ventures into John Sandford's world of mystery, I was pleasantly surprised with the evolution of this novel. Sudden Prey unfolds as a basic, run-of-the-mill suspense novel; I was afraid I was in for a long, winding story. The story then quickly picks up speed, riding fun and exciting characters via fast-paced action. I found myself devouring chapters at just as quick a pace to keep the suspense at its revengeful pitch. John Sandford has a new fan!"
4,"A Typical Sandford ""Prey"" Book--Very Good","Even though you basically know what the outcome of Sudden Prey will be shortly after you start it, Sandford--as usual-- keeps your eyes glued to the pages and your fingers anxious to turn them. Davenport, the cop, and Sandford, the writer, continue in form--top notch at what they do."
1,This could have been a shoot em up western-just silly!,"I have enjoyed many of Sandford's books. Why he wrote this shoot em up style novel, that you might find better placed in the 1860's, is beyond me. Hated this book....$10.00 bucks I will never see again. Skip this Prey book and move on to another one."
3,Blood and guts crime drama,"The police kill two bank robbers... women.The husband and brother of the two women,Dick LaChaise,together with two buddies forms a gang to revenge their deaths.The result is a bloody crime spree that includes hits of the police officer's relatives. Although well written and having no real sexual content, this for me is a very unpleasant book.It seems to dwell on the worst elements of crimes."
3,"Good thriller, moves along at a fast pace, terribly biased","I am a woman who recently read this thriller and while I enjoyed it, I was amazed that such a distinguished writer would so radically typecast his criminal characters... they were all hunters, or went to gun shows, or were friendly with gun dealers and I was terribly offended by this characterization. Shame on your Mr. Sandford. Criminals are as diverse as stars in the galaxy and come from all backgrounds."
5,The best Prey book,"I've read them all in order. It's great watching the Lucas Davenport character evolve. Sudden Prey was definitely the best Prey book. Non stop action, you can't put it down. Dick LaChaise is an animal, a great villain. I loved his character.Read 'em in order to fully appreciate the Prey series. John Sandford delivers as usual with this one!"
2,John Sandford Jumps the Shark,"I have enjoyed many of Sandford's books. This one failed me completely. Absolutely implausible story. Frustrating to have read it to the end hoping for some twist, some reward, and...nothing. Just an absurd farce featuring apparently psychic criminals, bumbling cops and a high body count. Without a doubt the most disappointing Sandford novel I have read."
5,Great story!,One of those books that are really hard to put down -- keeps your heart beating fast with each chapter!
5,A Real Page Turner,"Once again Mr. Sandford has done it . I have read all of his prey books, and still cant decide which one I enjoyed the most. Usually Im on the edge of my couch, with the hair on the back of my neck standing straight up. Thats the kind of reading I like, and John has given it to us"
2,"i'm a huge fan, but this was not their best effort!","""meant for you"", followed by ""friends"" starts the album off with a gentle sweetness, but the music doesn't follow up. ""busy doin' nothing"" has a nice bossa nova beat, i've always liked the flow of ""anna lee"". at the time of it's release this album was a huge departure for the beach boys musically. i recommend this album to serious beach boy fans, but not for a novice expecting songs about cars, girls, surfing, etc."
4,"Great album to ""cool out"" to","This album was sheer eveidence that their was a casual, friendly element to the man who created such masterpieces as Summer Days and Nights and Pet Sounds.Perhpas because people were expecting Brian to deliver another Pet sounds or a similar work. ""Friends"" is Brian making an album I believe just for the sake of amking some good music to ""relax"" too. The songs are good, not really sophisticated...but genuine. A true classic is ""Diamond Head"" a song that unless you knew it was the Beach Boys..you'd think it was a Don Ho instrumental. Other great tracks include...""Wake The World"" is perhaps the first pop song to use a tuba. ""Be Here In The Mornin'"" is another gem..that Al Jardine's Beach Boys Family and Friends is performing on tour. ""Anna Lee The Healer is a harmonic masterpiece. The songs are gentle....and unlike anything the group had done up to that point. Any real fan of the Beach Boys, should have a copy of ""Friends"""
5,A Very Fine Smooth Album.,"I am a huge fan of the Beach Boys, and the first time I heard this album, I was awe struck. I noticed it had a good flow to it and it was great relaxation music. ""Friends"" is a pleasent song, But my Two favorites are ""Be here in the Morning"" and ""Busy doing nothin."" Although a far cry from Pet Sounds, It is still an excellent album, even though I am 14 years old. A must have for any huge Beach Boy fan. You'll wasnt to ""Be There in the Morning"" to hear this classic. My only recommendation is that Capitol releases more of there studio albums in the U.S."
3,A welcome addition to Beach Boys fan cd collection!,"When this album appeared, the first thing that struck me - Bruce Johnston finally appeared on the cover with the other Beach Boys ( though only in illustration form). A beautiful, but overlooked album, my favorite number is still the title track, ""Friends."" This album would be a welcome additon to a true Beach Boy fan's colletion. Surfer Dude"
5,breathtaking and relaxing,"This is a far cry from previous Beach Boys albums, but a pleasant surprise. It proves that Brian was not the only great songwriter in the group; Dennis has staked a claim to that. His songs ""Little Bird"" and ""Be Still"" are two beautiful songs, and shows this hard rockin' drummer's soft side."
2,Picky Birds?,"The shipment arrived quickly with the product in perfect condition. However, Birds do not come to this cake as readily as another brand and I also found this same item for less at a local retailer. I will not buy them again."
5,Feathered friends favorite,"""My"" birds -and squirrels- love this suet cake. Unfortunately, it cannot be bought on Amazon anymore. I am bereft. My little friends will now be introduced to a variety of other ""flavors"" so I know which one they prefer."
1,Not all it's cracked up to be!,"I had high hopes for this spoon, as it was a favorite of America's Test Kitchen. The first time I used it, it developed a fine crack that became a gaping wound within a few more uses. I never soaked the spoon or left it in the pot. Needless to say, I had to throw it away. What a complete waste of money!"
2,"Well designed, but not ""solid""","I purchased this spoon to protect the finish on enameled cast iron cookware. While well designed ergonomically, the bowl of the spoon cracked after only being used twice even though I was careful to hand wash and promptly dry it. Hopefully its replacement will last longer, but I question whether beechwood -- while inexpensive -- is durable enough."
1,bad spoon.,"Received as a gift earlier in the year.have used it twice in the past month when making soup.does not ""sit"" in the soup.hand washed and dried immediately.the spoon has cracked :( I have asked Amazon if it can be replaced....."
5,dog cookies,"My dog loves these cookies. Much easier than giving him a pill. Bulk size is a good deal. My 120 pound 12 year old Leonburger needs several cookies a day to supplement his regular food. We hate seeing him get old, but this product is helping him to be active."
4,power rangers,"I wasn't crazy about buying this toy for fear of the ability to take out an eye, but so far it's ok. My son love PR and so this was a must-have toy for him. He likes to watch the show sometimes and play along."
2,"Weak battery, impeller disintegrated","Like others, I found the battery charge to be very short; I have a small lot and could barely do both walks and the driveway before the power faded. But the final straw was having the plastic impeller break apart for no apparently reason; I am a small woman who handles the device delicately and it's never been dropped or treated roughly and yet ... it's now useless. Very disappointed; I think I'll stick with a regular broom from now on."
1,Disposable Electric Broom,"I owned this unit for about two years when for no apparent reason, the impeller shattered. No replacement spare part is available, instead Black And Decker wanted me to buy a complete blower assembly! I would only purchase one of these blowers if you are able to accept the fact that you will most likely have to throw it out when it breaks."
2,short lived blower,"I bought this blower as a quick and easy way to blow the leaves off my deck. It worked great for that, about four times. After less than an hours use it started to make a rattling noise and stopped blowing. When I look in the bottom I can see that the motor is tilted and there is a piece of broken plastic floating around. Obviously the motor mount is broken. I will send it in for repair but it is very disappointing to have something go bad this soon"
2,"Easy to use, but only for a short time","This unit was very easy to set up. Basically, you slide on the nozzle. Then you attach the unit to the charging base. And you plug the charger into the wall. That's it for setup!Using the unit is also very easy. There is a single switch on top that you flip and away you go. Since the unit is completely battery operated, there are no cords or gasoline issues to worry about. The whole tool is idiot-proof.However, with the battery on a full charge, you only have about 15 minutes of full power. After that time, the unit looses charge quickly until it only puts out a small puff of air. By then you're waving the thing around so much you might as well get a broom to do some actual work.I give this item 5 stars for ease of use, but only 1 star for doing what it's actually intended for, which is blowing. Considering I don't normally buy blowers for any other use, I give it 2 stars overall."
1,B&D I2V Cordless Electric Broom,"The B&D 12V Cordless Broom works well. It comes with a self contained battery and its own charging station, meaning it's ready for use when you are. It maintains about a 10-15 minute charge, and the airflow force is more than adequate for most ""smooth surface"" applications. Now the bad news: the plastic impeller, which forces the air from the broom, will last on average about 2 years, before it instantaneously shatters, rendering the broom useless. You cannot order the plastic impeller by itself; and instead, you have to order the complete ""blower assembly"", at a cost of about $15 less than a completely new power broom. Accordingly, unless you wish to replace the blower assembly or complete cordless broom every couple of years or so, I believe you would be better served by purchasing a model which contains a metal impeller."
2,Little plastic impeller ruins the whole product,I'm one of the many who are complaining about the plastic fan. This product was perfect for my small yard and deck. Now the impeller blew up and I have to throw out the whole product. What a waste.
1,Stay away from this blower,"Like other reviewers have stated its battery life is poor. However, worse is after 28 months (just out of warranty and they will not exchange it at their warranty centers) the impeller breaks and they do not sell non-battery parts for this blower so a perfectly good unit otherwise ends up in the landfill. Black and Decker is a good enivironmental corporate citizen!!!"
4,easy clean up!,"This is our second 12 vt electric broom. We wore the other one out!! Kind of bummed that it could not be repaired, but like it so much better than the 18 vt model that is available in stores. It came quickly in the mail."
4,Black and Decker CS100 blower,I use this blower out in my barn. I love the fact that I do not have to have electric cords laying around. I have tried gas blowers but they are heavy and emitt fumes. This blower is a perfect size and has enough power to blow out the stalls. I absolutely love the fact that it was delivered the day after I ordered it!
1,"poor design, poor support","friend gave it to me, free, because blower motor fan wheel busted.The blower wheel is made out of plastic (ridiculous)Black and Decker wants to sell the whole motor assembly for $50.00Wheel probably would cost them $1.00 in quantity purchase.Lame.Avoid."
1,Impeller Exploded / No Replacement Parts,"I was happy with this blower which I owned for approx 2 years until plastic impeller exploded. Not a problem as you can get replacement parts for anything, right .... NOT! B&D will only sell whole assemblies. What a joke. I was reluctant to purchase Black & Decker, but took a chance. Never again! Purchase at your risk but know service life is ????"
3,C Zimmerman,"I have a huge yard so a heavy duty yard electric blower/vac is a must, but they are cumbersome and heavy. I bought this product 27 months ago and LOVE it. Light weight and gets the deck OR large patio blown off before battery goes out. Recharge time is pretty fast so I'd rather wait for it to recharge then lug out the heavy duty blower. Another plus is the long nose which allows you to efficiently direct the debris rather than spread it around. Now the bad news...3 months after the warranty expires the plastic propeller literally blows up without warning. I love the product enough to consider another but am going to shop around first to see if there is an alternative to the plastic propeller without getting too heavy."
2,"Low power, short life.",I was disappointed that the battery is not detachable. I have several B&D products with 12 volt batteries and it would have been nice to use them as the charge on this blower is very short lived. Every time I have used it I end up finishing the job with the electric blower. That kind of defeats the purpose of purchasing this unit.
5,Black & Decker Cordless Broom,Great tool for those small jobs....cleaning garage - cleaning up after mowing - getting rid of leaves from beds and deck.
1,Last Black and Decker product,"Like others, my impeller shattered today. I won't bother trying to get a new one based on the reviews here.Yesterday I received two ""pod"" style 14.4 volt batteries for my cordless B and D hedge trimmer from Amazon (thank you) because the product is obsolete. With the new batteries, I learned the charger is dead, so I ordered another from Amazon so I can keep using the trimmer.My second B and D string trimmer just died at a little over two years. The motor burned out on the first after, you guessed it, a little over two years.Based on my experience, Black and Decker equipment is worthless junk. I will never buy one of their products again."
2,impeller/fan shattered,Convienient to use but the impeller/fan shattered. It is made from a very brittle plastic. B&D does not sell a replacement. Would like to find a more quality non-B&D product.
2,Buyer beware - breaking fan blade,"This was a great little blower. It had enough battery power for about 15 min, just the right amount of time to clean out the garage and deck. But...the impeller fan broke after about two years of use for no apparent reason. This seems to be a common problem and the only replacement part is a new blower assembly for ~$50 instead of a $2.50 fan blade."
2,lawn lady,I was a little surprised by the lack of battery life on this cordless broom. I thought I would get 5 minutes of life and it is barely 1 minute long. So sorry I bought it.
5,No Cords Necessary,The cordless sweeper has lots of power and the great part is that you don't have to worry about plugging it in. You can use it anywhere..It is good for about 15 minutes and then needs to be recharged.We are happy with the purchase.
3,It is only ok.,"I should have gotten the bigger model. The battery doesn't last long enough and the force isn't as strong as I'd like it to be. It is a good product but, I simply should have gotten the larger one."
2,Great until impeller cracked rendering unit garbage,Great until impeller cracked rendering unit garbage. I used it lightly for a about 2 years. It worked well for quick cleanup of grass clipping after mowing.
2,Better to invest in a good blower,This blower has no power. Brand new and I could barely sweep my drive-waybefore the power was gone. I guess the truth is you get what you paid for.I rather pay more for great quality.
2,Shadow Chambliss,"We have had two of these and live in a rural city and cannot locate replacement batteries... B&D should list the battery and price with the tool...If you read the fine print and let the machine run completely down and then recharge, you can sometimes improve the battery time/life"
1,Don't Buy,The impeller broke on my CS100; maybe used 30 hours over 2 years. B&D; won't sell a replacement.Junk
3,Decent Study Guide for Fans of the Main Hardcover,"For those who enjoyed the ""Technical Analysis Explained"" by Pring, but want to know if they can recall some of the facts, this is a great accompaniment, whether for an examination or just for some fun. (For CMT and CFT Level 1, this book would not help much, as the exam questions do not cover much charting, despite assigning the main text book as core reading). The multiple choice style questions cover nearly all chapters. There are around 10 to 20 questions per chapter, which implies that one can finish the entire quiz book within a day. At $20, it is a bit on the expensive side, hence my low valuation."
1,Alert !!! Don't buy this book.,"This is not the book, this is a STUDY GUIDE a stupid question and answers....I was MISLED by the cover because they are almost the same.. and for someone who have not read the book it is hard to know from the small image of the cover you see on the web page....WTF 25 bucks for a Q/A book ?!! with no content at all...Don't buy this thing... it is useless."
1,"Reactionist rant, or, Why does no-one sound like Lincoln anymore?",'What is written without effort is in general read without pleasure.' Johnson wrote it; Watson cites it and embodies it. He and Lynn Truss would get along just fineAnd they talk about whingeing poms..
4,Low tech hardware savings plan,"Linksys provides one of the best, versatile, and easy to use console switches on the market. I've used others that cost less, but broke only weeks later. The first one I got 3 years ago is still working.This is an easy way to share a monitor, keyboard, and mouse with multiple CPUs. The device allows either keyboard enabled or hardware buttons to switch between systems. New systems can be added without creating new problems. Just plug and play.Worth the price."
2,Bad video for me too,I replaced a Belkin Omniview KVM with this Linksys SVIEW04. And like others who have submitted reviews I too experienced poor video quality using the same cables that produced good quality video with the Belkin. In general there is text ghosting. Another way of describing it is that text has shadows. Quality varies with the application. With my MVS Host emulation app the text is barely readable. The other issue I have with swith is the lack of a simple to use hotkey that switches between only active PC's. But I would keep it if it weren't for the video quality.
5,Very thoughtful,I had met the author on a cruise and was impressed with his insightful lectures. He is meticulous in sighting his sources.
4,Stability or Sizzle??,"This is the choice poor Kelly is asked to make in this fabulous novel by McCucheon. As an avid reader of romance novels, I have to say this is one of the best I have read in a while. It is a fast-paced, no brainer, that keeps you laughing the entire way through. Though I loved the entire cast, my favorite has to be Scott, the devilish brother always there to give Kelly both advice and a headache. I am definitely looking forward to his story in January.Until then, go out and read this book. And if you already have, I'd also suggest you add Body Check and Say No To Joe? to your reading list."
5,HARD TO BELIEVE......,"That not alot of people have reviewed this, I mean! It's been out awhile! And I absolutely LOVED this whole series. The story of a love between a rock star, Shuichi Shindou and novelist, Eiri Yuki.LOVED IT!"
2,An incomplete CD,"Think you're buying a CD with 5 Mozart symphonies on it?Think again. I just received it and was stunned to see that only 1 movement of symphonies nos. 26 and 32 are included. What happened to the other 4 movements? It's a mystery.Now, while I am disgruntled, I have to point out that this is not Amazon's fault, as it clearly shows on the disk contents that those two symphonies are incomplete. But who would think to check? Not me.But now you know.That said, these are wonderful performances as have been noted by others here; so if you just tell yourself that you're getting 3 symphonies for a bargain price you will be happy.Or, maybe you'll choose to spend a little more and get one of the other CDs offered that include the entire symphonies."
2,"Promises a great vacation, but falls short","Foolish...they have the opportunity to explore things and maybe have an real adventure, but instead their adventure is meeting this ""gorgeous"" singer and of course, falling in love with him. And Marco, being conceited, strings the five of them along during the whole vacation. Naturally, they have boyfriends back home. The one good part was when they finally wise up and cook up a delicious plan to get back at Marco."
3,The Forgotten Pistolero/The Unholy Four,"I will give 4 stars for the ""Forgotten Pistolero"". It is a good movie, and the music is great, but ""The Unholy Four"" breaks up, and gets stuck. I could not watch it, so I cannot give a rating."
5,Outstanding,"This is a superb recording of this rarely performed work. Janacek was never afraid of violating convention and this opera is no exception. Dramatized from Doestoevsky's novel, it lacks a conventional plot with a single dramatic action and clear primary characters. Instead, From The House of the Dead is a series of episodes treating the themes of crime, punishment, and expiation. The structure is mirrored in the structure of the music, which has sort of a theme and variations structure. The score has been reconstructed to approximate Janacek's original intentions, dropping accretions added after his death by some of his well intentioned disciples. The result is also atypical with orchestration featuring a relatively small orchestra and ensemble, as opposed to star-oriented, vocal parts. The result is certainly unconventional and features some of Janacek's most powerful music."
5,"Amazing, Gut Wrenching and Life Afirming","This opera is a 20th century masterpiece easily on a par with Elektra, Lady Macbeth, Peter Grimes and Wozzeck. One can only hope that eventually it will be performed as often as these works (maybe the recent MET broadcast will help). The orchestration is very transparent and strangely melodic, and the drama is gripping. If you have begun to weary of endless versions of Boheme, Traviata and Carmen, and can appreciate the aforementioned works, you owe it to yourself to check this out."
3,"Useful, but flawed, introduction to the Albanian language","Colloquial Albanian is a useful, but flawed, introduction to Albanian. The book is fairly clearly explained and the lessons are graded quite effectively. Nevertheless, there are some flaws. Some words and expressions in the book are used regionally and sound quite strange when coming from a foreigner. I actually had people laugh at me when I used ""tash"" (which means ""now"", but is used primarily in Kosovo) instead of ""tani"" in Tirana, Albania's capital. A friend had a similar experience when she tried to say ""you're welcome"" to someone. The expression given near the beginning of the book, ""me nder qofsh,"" is a beautiful expression. It is, however, quite dated and almost never heard anymore in response to ""faleminderit"" (thank you). It would not be a flaw to include such words and expressions in such a book if they were clearly marked.Despite these problems, this is probably the best introduction to Albanian currently on the market."
4,"Very helpful, faleminderit!","I have been studying Albanian for over a year and used several texts. The Colloquial Albanian book and cassette set has been one of the most helpful. It follows a logical progression of language building and uses reading/listening passages with humor and variety. The audio cassette was especially helpful for building comprehesion/fluency. My only suggestion is that the speakers speak unusually slowly and often overenunciate on the cassette. It would be helpful to have speakers use a more natural speed for non-native speakers to imitate. However, it was a very good bargain for the price and I would recommend this book to anyone wanting to study this beautiful and complex language."
3,"Overall good book, but bad binding","The book is designed as a teaching/learning tool, and as such one would expect the pages to remain in the book. However we now have all of chapters 1 and 2 as loose leaf, and I expect chapter three to begin falling out. We have other paperbacks that are MUCH more heavily used that do not fall apart. I also highly recommend getting the accompying tape."
1,Albanian......,"I am albanian, This book is NOT the proper albanian to learn. This was written in Kosovo dialect, which is only used in Kosovo Yugoslavia. An Albanian from Albania or Montenegro will not fully understand you and most likely make fun of you. Its like a foriegner learning english from a Mexican Immigrant. Find another book."
1,wildly disappointing,"If you like an arrogant, preachy book of radical environmentalism (along with just about every other left-wing cause getting a plug) sugar-coated with very mild humor, you'll love this book. If you want to read a genuinely funny book (although you still get the ultra-liberal world view), read Pest Control instead. The Organ Grinders was disapointing not only in it's lack of humor, but in a total lack of ANY likable characters."
3,Page Grinder,"This was a quick and entertaining read. The plot and sub-plots were good. You always wonder in the back of your mind what is going on with the other scenarios and characters. To me, that is a good sign, when you're reading a book and you are genuinely curious about what is going on in other parts of the book! A good read and a good recommendation!"
2,Grind alright!,"I read Pest Control and absolutly loved it - it is the type of book you can denfinately see being made into a movie. However, I found The Organ Grinders very difficult to read. Much as I appreciate how Fitzhugh is trying to make us see some of the ills of the modern world (very commendable!) but I just found it heavy going. In fact I'm only three quarters of the way through and it's taken four weeks to read this far (I normally finish a book within a week). I could quite happily put the book on the shelf and forget about it; the only thing keeping me reading it is the fact I don't want to waste the time I've already invested. Sorry if I sound scathing, Just disappointed, Pest Control is brill, Maybe I should shelf The organ Grinders and read that again!"
3,Channeling Carl Haissen,"It reminds me of Carl Hiassen's treatment of his characters... and I don't mean 'treatment' in the way that is usually meant. I mean treatment in terms of how you treat someone that you know. Fitzhugh puts his characters through repeatedly awful and wack-o things on just about every page. And while many situations *could* conceivably happen in real life, the odds are against it (at least I'm hoping so... I'd have given up about 20 pages into my life had this cacophony of crap happened to me.) If I wasn't so mentally tired as well as physically tired I think I would have liked this book a whole lot more. =:) If you like Hiassen's books, you will definitely like this one."
1,WASN'T WHAT I EXPECTED,"I FOUND THIS BOOK TO BE DEPRESSING, NOT FUNNY. I was under the impression this was going to be a light and fun(ny) read but it turned out to be more doomsday. MONEY ALWAYS WINS OUT! IRRegardlessI feel as reviewer James_Baird@brown.edu Providence, Rhode Island ""...but the topic is so serious to me that I did not find it pleasing to think about.""The first chapter was good...as was the postscript ""Man has lost the capacity to foresee and to forestall. He will end by destroying the Earth."" Dr. Albert SchweitzerI totally agree with Dr. AS"
2,Eco-Guerrillas on the Move!,"Eco-terrorists take on everything from corporate America and the biomedical industry to rude drivers in Fitzhugh's latest. Hero Paul Symon blames business mogul Jerry Landis for the death of his father, and for every other evil that plagues mortal man--or at least that plagues members of the Sierra Club. Landis truly is a horrid, self-absorbed man, providing plenty of impetus for Paul's evolution from solid citizen with a social conscience to Mother Nature's front line guerrilla, with help from his Amazon lady love, Georgette. Contrasts abound in this book, which alternates between screwball comedy and paragraphs which seem to be straight from the Zero Population Growth Handbook. There's some entertainment to be found here, but you'll need your flashlight: this is dark humor at its blackest."
3,A kinda funny thing happened on the way to the moral dilema,"Timely topics, larger than life characters and an ending you can see coming a mile away. This book tries, and almost succeeds, at being good. There is a Catch 22 feeling about the characters and a quick light style to the text. Unfortunately the whole thing never quite clicks and I found myself skimming ahead to the end."
4,Transplants,"If you can stand warped, sick, and gross humor that is hysterically funny fiction, try some of his books. Incredible imagination and very easy reading. I think there is a serious underlying cause for the basis of his stories."
1,Waste of Time,"I am a HUGE Bill Fitzhugh fan and I thought this book was a complete waste of time. It was sick and twisted and hard to follow...not at all like his previous book, Pest Control. I was extremely disappointed in this book. If you want a good book by Bill Fitzhugh, try Pest Control or Crossdressing...They were GREAT!"
3,"Amusing, but less clever than Pest Control","An entertaining book. Good depiction of the biotech world gone mad, a satisfying villain, and a kind of nudgy hero. Not quite as clever as Fitzhugh's previous novel, Pest Control, but still worth reading on vacation."
3,"50,000 ft-level architectural overview","I saw Ms. Imhoff give a talk, so I was motivated to buy her book. I was expecting more detail and more depth, but I was satisfied anyway. As a new comer to the data warehousing/OLAP field, I found it helpful to have a book that showed me the ""forest""; many other books are available to show me the ""trees.""The book is a very high-level architectural overview of the components of a ""corporate information factory"", including the data warehouse, data mart, and operational data store. It describes the components and their relationships. It describes the motivations and reasons these components are organized the way they are. It describes some of the important engineering tradeoffs in alternate designs.The book is a quick and simple read. I got a few very important concepts and ideas from it, but I must definitely read several other books for greater depth and focus."
2,a book obsessed with technologies,"The very idea that all the technologies serve the purpose of businesses gets lost here in this book.If one wants to look for help for their work, look somewhere else.If one wants to learn some jargons to impress his/her date, this one is the ideal one."
1,A sophomoric attempt to explain information architecture,"This is a book that attempts to explain how information flows through an organization. It puts data warehousing at the center of this architecture. - If this is so, why are there many organizations successfully making use of information technology without data warehousing or with small scale use of data warehousing?If you want to read Inmon's thoughts on data warehousing, you'd be better off reading ""Building the Data Warehouse"" and ""Using the Data Warehouse""."
5,The best book ever for newborns!,"My two-month old LOVES this book, as well as the other cloth Maisy books. It is the perfect size for him to hold, and since it is so light he can play with it on his lap without me having to hold it for him. When I show him this book, his eyes get wide and he bats at the pictures with delight. He has several baby books, including ""Pat the Bunny"", but the cloth Maisy books are his favorites by far. The bright colors, bold pictures, and soft fabric add up to a perfect book for the youngest readers."
2,Product and seller warnings,"I too ordered one of these batteries from BargainCell because they stated it was in stock, and it was the cheapest option. I waited several weeks and it didn't arrive. Finally, I received an email from them saying they were cancelling my order because they didn't have any in stock. Because they cancelled my order I cannot leave a 1-star rating for BargainCell! I checked Amazon and BargainCell still listed the item as being in stock, and the listing remains the same today.If you actually want your battery to arrive, buy it from Accessory Genie.The battery I received did not fit properly in my FZ20. It went in okay, but to get it out I had to pry it out with a knife after several minutes of tapping and wiggling the battery. The problem is that the plastic on the sides was formed incorrectly and has bulges. I carefully took a utility knife and scraped off the very top layer of plastic on the sides and now the battery fits and works just fine."
5,Love the Movie,This movie was amazing! We saw it in Dubai. I am a big fan of superhors and comic chareters. It was nice seeing the more human side of such chareters for once; almost anyone is a superhero on the screen now; I guess after smallville people rellzied that these folks are human at heart after all.They fight they get angry and they have vengfull relationships.
3,X GF not so super,"Great concept, but ends up as thin soup. Likeable actors, professionally made, but for me the approach never clicked."
3,Grown-up Superwoman,"Cute, shallow fairy tale for adults. Kids might enjoy as well. Ok movie. Would not see twice."
4,You may think the sex would be awesome..however,"BUCKLE UP !!!Oh dont ever piss off a woman .. but if she is stronger than you, you really have problems."
5,Super,"The movie is totally silly and it's something we can all relate to (a crazy girlfriend or boyfriend. I rarely laugh at comedies, but this one did make me laugh. Uma Thurman was great! Cool computer graphic effects."
3,3.5 stars (slipt in the middle),"it was cheesy yet entertaining with some of the humors and action scenes, she's no super woman or man but she'll do some what..The thing that i didn't like were her costumes when she is saving the day that wasn't cheesy it was corny hehehe...but hey i guess the movie isn't about prefection or oscar worthiness but if you were entertain and i was some what, but funny enough i would still get it for my dvd collection.....I STILL LOVE U LUKE...."
3,A little too over the top,It was basically what you would think it would be. It was fine... entertaining. I would have liked quite a bit if the relationship aspect of the film was more realistic. People can be crazy in relationships. I don't the film needed to go completely psycho. It would have been much funnier if it was more realistic... in terms of the relationship. Then add in all the super hero stuff.
4,This Movie Got Me Laughing,"People I know warned me that ""My Super Ex-Girlfriend"" wasn't the best Uma Thurman or Luke Wilson ever made. Well, actually, they said that it was really bad. But, I ended up lauhing so much plot issues didn't bother me. I thought that it had some great adult humor. My brother had a night off from work, so he came over and started to watch it. The movie put him to sleep. Maybe this is because women would find the Uma-stronger-than-Luke jokes more amusing then men? 3-4 stars."
3,entertaining flick,"The premise is fun, and the movie is overall enjoyable, however, I definitely feel that this movie could have been handled and written better. It's as if some parts of this movie were trying to be serious, while others were spoofing the superhero genre, so overall the story did not flow as well as it could.Still, it is not without its good parts, and I enjoyed watching it - Uma Thurman makes a nice superhero, so I would recommend that you rent this film before you decide to buy."
4,"((The best ""shoe on the other foot"" concept yet))","((The best ""shoe on the other foot"" concept yet)).. LOL, imagine women with the superior physical strength.. The social aspect would be an whole other ball game.. This movie should've gotten a better play..."
3,A Battle of the sexes where one of them can fly,"This movie had a funny premise- imagine if your emotionally disturbed, paranoid, violent, neurotic basket-case of an ex-girlfriend also has super powers- and I think it was pulled off tolerably well. Mind you, a lot of it was definitely uncreative assembly-line humor so typical of Hollywood comedy, but I actually laughed out loud at some of the lines, as well as at the sheer unabashed silliness of the movie. I mean, that part where Uma Thurman tried to kill Luke Wilson and his new girlfriend by throwing a live_Great White Shark_through the window of a high rise apartment was just so insanely off the wall, surreal, idiotic and unexpected, I just had to laugh in utter amazement at the writers' obvious derangement. It's a little blue for a cartoonish PG-13 movie, so I wouldn't bring it home for the kids, but for adults it has some funny insights into relationships and some laughs. It's no comedy classic, but fair entertainment for a boring night."
3,Entertaining,"I found this movie entertaining enough to watch once. But I don't think I'll throw away another hour and a half to catch this one again. The humor was oftentimes over the top, the acting was quite over-exaggerated, and the only thing to really take from this is that if you are dating a bullet-proof superhero, be careful when you break things off because they might attempt to exact revenge with super-human capabilities. But the precious few minutes of actual comedy made this worth watching once.A kid movie? Absolutely not. The humor is waaaaay too mature. A date movie? That is borderline and I could suggest hundreds of titles more suitable. Got nothing else to watch and picked this up at your local Blockbuster... okay sure!! But make sure you rent it. Buying it will just be a waste of money."
4,"G-girl means ""G-spot""??","Although a funny movie, this should be rated R for the simulated bedroom sex scenes. Not for under 17! Good lesson for those in needy relations. Greatlove story with a happy ending. Watch it and write your own review!"
3,good movie,"this was a pretty darn good movie. i saw it and thought it was funny, but its not for everyone. it was like halarious or nothing, but was good. try it out and see for yourself."
3,Just Too Bitchy For Words,"I just LOVE superheroes (and superheroines, too) so I had expected to love this comedy automatically; it just couldn't go wrong. Could it? Well, yeah, it could go wrong-- and did. Uma Thurman plays G-Girl, a cold, neurotic, superhero who is in love with Luke Wilson, a guy who has all the warmth and charm of a brick. Together, they make this film fly like an iron butterfly: phzzzt, right into the ground! Why is Uma so damn bitchy in this film? I don't know, but if they were showing this film on an airplane, I think I would walk out on it anyway. This movie isn't bad, it's just not funny and not very pleasant; and in fact, it is a rip-off of another less than stellar superhero movie, Meteor Man. Still, as superheroes goes, ""G-Girl"" isn't too bad. Not bad at all...But I really do have to praise this DVD for one thing: on one disk we get both the widescreen version of the movie and the full screen version as well. More DVDs should be made like this."
1,Absolutely horrible,"This is probably one of the worst movie's I've ever seen, outside of Joe vs. the Volcano or The Addams Family. I like Uma Thurman and usually find her to be enjoyable. I did not have strong feelings either way about Luke Wilson, but now he is on my list of actors to avoid (along with Kevin Costner). My husband is a fan of Rainn Wilson, but even he could not salvage this horrendous movie. The storyline and the dialogue were just awful, and not even in a funny good-awful kind of way. My husband wanted to dig his eyes out with a rusty spoon about halfway through the movie, and I was ready to fall asleep. Please do not see this movie - you will regret wasting your time with it."
3,Has its moments.,"My Super Ex-Girlfriend is a cute and harmless romantic/adventure flick. Uma Thurman is always great in these comedic roles. You wouldn't think Thurman could pull off funny but she does, she is no one-trick pony. Luke Wilson and Anna Faris are also fabulous in their roles and they have great chemistry too. I love the part where Wilson's car says ""You Suck"" - so funny! This movie is good in terms of acting but kinda flat in the writing. A mixed bag for me."
1,"Should be rated R, only gets one star. Horrible!","Great concept that was somehow hijacked by adolescent boy idiots. My wife and I were compelled to watch this movie in a holiday family setting with our 11 and 14 year-old nieces. What an awful experience. Can you imagine an ultra-foxy (Uma) superhero girl who falls in love with an insensitive, clueless worm of a man? No? There's more--she wants to have sex with him all the time, right from the beginning. Did I mention that the guy has no redeeming qualities whatsoever? And then Uma's character fights another foxy woman for this guy. Let's summarize: clueless, moronic, guy with no respect for women is pursued and fought over by two beautiful women, one of whom can fly?A great idea completely ruined. And I have no idea how this thing could be rated PG-13--the sexual innuendo is gratuitous, stupid, and nonstop."
3,Don't let 3 stars fool you!,"I loved this movie. It was exactly what i expected. I've seen movies like this in the past that really took themselves too seriously. This movie gets everything right. It's all about this guy who finds out his unbalanced girlfriend has superpowers. Of course, she uses them to ruin his life. This movie works mostly because of the cast. Uma Thurman and Luke Wilson play wonderfully off each other. They even threw in Wanda Sykes to up the comedic value. This movie never gets old, I no because i keep watching it!"
3,My Super Ex-Girlfriend,"This is lighweight fun. Reasonably funny, romantic, and overall good story, it is at the very least worth a rental. If you go in for wacky comedys like ""Shallow Hal"" or ""Blades of Glory"", you will probably enjoy it. Uma Thurman and Luke Wilson team up nicely in this romantic comedy about a jilted Super Woman. The film never takes anything to seriously and it works. Afterall if you were threatened with a chainsaw up your backside, how would you feel if someone with super powers made that threat? You can imagine how she makes his life miserable when he breaks up with with her. If you enjoyed this catch ""Mystery Men"". Overall an enjoyable movie for the teens and adults. Good quality DVD with a few extras. Fair replayability."
3,"Silly, but fun","I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. Uma Thurman plays Jenny, a mentally unstable superhero who falls in love with Matt (Luke Wilson), who's just a ""regular guy."" Matt has a hard time getting used to Jenny's emotional (and sometimes violent) outbursts, so he breaks up with her and becomes involved with a coworker (Anna Faris). Unfortunately, Jenny doesn't take very well to being dumped, and she decides to get revenge on Matt by doing things like destroying the ceiling in his apartment, throwing a shark through his new girlfriend's apartment window, etc. Feeling that he has no other choice, Matt teams up with Jenny's arch-nemesis (Eddie Izzard) and plots to rid Jenny of her powers. Things don't exactly go as planned, but the film wraps up with a happy ending for everyone.Overall, this is a fun little movie that's a bit stupid in places, but still fun to watch. If you're in the mood for a few laughs, check it out."
4,"Funny movie, original idea--writing could have been better","Imagine if your psycho ex had super powers--she might actually try to kill you! What a lemony twist of black comedy. I like how harried and annoyed G-Girl behaves at having to save the city all the time. I love how Matt tells her like it is no holds barred further aggravating her violently jealous side. Even after she emblazons ""DICK"" on his forehead he still isn't that afraid of her. The shark scene is an amazing special effect, but the ""sex"" scenes with her destroying the bed are a bit stupid but funny in hindsight. If the writers had taken a little more time with the script they could have made a more lasting impression flick with better dialogue but overall it's a good laugh. Worth watching more than once."
3,"HELL HATH NO FURY LIKE A ""SUPER"" WOMAN SCORNED!","This movie has a very interesting premise and is helped by good performances. What I thought would be a light hearted comedy bordered on sick funny like the ""The Cable Guy"" with Jim Carrey. It isn't as dark as that film but, Uma does play her jilted needy superhero ex-girlfriend to the hilt! Not Bad but, could have been much better. A wonderful premise sort of wasted, it is worth a look though."
3,fun show,"MSEG is a entertaining movie and is light breezy fun. UMA THURMAN and LUKE WILSON are perfect in their roles. UMA shows a multi personality performance, she can be menacing, catty and beautiful all roled up into one. LUKE is your basic average ""JOE"" and totally likeable. story cut short: she gets powers from a meterorite that fell from the sky(never really explained and so what). what makes this movie works are the sincere performances from the actors-sure, its totally dispensible-the inevitable relationship, jealousy and insecurity problems are all that it takes to get UMA upset(you do not want to upset UMA). while you won't really learn anything from this movie because of its predictability-you will however be won over. pure escapism and isn't that why we go to the movies?!!!"
3,IT'S FUNNY BUT...,"This movie was funny but it's not exciting. The story was not good, however something missed. The fighting scene was nice but it's not specified."
3,Good times,"A needy, nurotic superhero, that's a new one. This movie is silly and a good one to watch if you're not looking for anything to deep and thought provoking. The shark scene and ending are really the best bits in here. If you really want it (and can't settle for just renting it when you get in the mood) buy it out of the bargian bin, because it isn't worth $19.95."
2,Uma ne nado!,"Which means in Russian ""You do not meed brain for this!"" Extremely predictable, boring and even Uma Thurman could not save it. The currently popular reversal of gender roles (strong woman and a weak man) is boring too - who wants to see a total moron as a hero? And how could a supposedly super-intelligent super-heroine fall in love with smth like that? Though the heroine does not show any super intelligence either - mostly she displays strong hysterics and deep rooted neurosis.Wasted time - Uma Thurman's and wasted money - mine."
2,This Girlfriend is a Dud,If it wasn't for the talents of the very funny Uma Thurman. This movie would get one star. Which is sad because this movie had the potential to be great. Uma made this movie worth watching. Luke Wilson is good but not in this movie. Wanda Sykes was just funny but not enough to save this movie.
2,Super Dud!,"Gawd, this movie is a very bad teenage flick! It was way too trite & predictable at that! No wonder this movie didn't last long in the movie theaters. The acting was bad too. Rainn Wilson who plays Luke Wilson's best friend in this movie, is the only one whom is even remotely funny."
1,One of the worse movies ever,"This is by far the worse picture I've ever seen. I can't belive that with all the money they wasted in fx, they could't use it for a better story. How could Uma let her self in to this... Maybe you are thinking it's a kids movie, but is not. Believe me this is not worth it, it makes you sick."
1,Unnecessary,"The word that best describes this yawner - unnecessary. Full of unnecessary violence and sexual inuendo without a connection to the plot. An unnecessary waste of film and film-makers time. I *almost* chuckled at one point in this ""comedy"" but then my chuckle turned into a yawn waiting for the funny part, thinking, ""certainly it cannot be this bad all the way through."" But, it is, and led to me spending unnecessary time I could have been watching something entertaining. Rent it from the library if you must but do not waste any money on it."
2,About What I Expected (sigh),"I expected the most simplistic of performances considering the number of selections offered. All of the selections sound pretty-much the same. I'll play some of them, and ignore the rest. Glad I ordered more than just this collection. Also, on several of the songs, the words and melodies were changed from what they were originally, slightly."
3,Worth the try but doesn't always work that great.,"The instructions lack alot to desire. Infact they don't even tell you mix ratios, you'll need to search the web for this. Doing what the instructions say to do is extreamly tedious, time consuming and painfull to do properly. The product is very professional, however I've had mixed results with how well it holds up for repairs. In summary it's worth a try, however it's not worth counting on this working or holding up over time."
4,great first time with you....,this was a great first experience with amazon. my product was mailed to mein a very timely manner and arrived exactly the way it was promised. have already ordered my second book. the book is just what i was looking for. gave me the information i needed. thank you.
2,long boring work of different loving,"If you're into lots of personal stories and testimonials, then this book is for you. The book drags on and on. I felt as if the author was making the whole subject of alternative sexual practices clinical to avoid discouraging people from the subject.Its safe to say that not everyone is into dominance and submission as a sexual playtime activity, but if you are or at least have an interest in it, the last thing you need is this book of drivel to help you along in this 'play time'. But, if you're writing a college paper on sexual deviance or what ever the mainstream happens to call it now, this book will give plenty of quotables for you to add. There is absolutely no 'how-to'. Nothing to tell to pique the imagination."
5,Absolutely Fantastic Book!!!,"I started reading this and could hardly put it down. From the very start I was seeing my reasons for sexual submissiveness described to a ""T"". It talks about a wide variety of topics, & even those that don't interest me personally -- were interesting to read about for the educational value into other's fetish's... A must have D/S book for anyone's collection!"
2,Different Loving : The World of Sexual Dominance and Submiss,"This is a rather dry overview. It features some case studies and interviews, but they tend to be somewhat superficial and limited. I didn't find much that was enlightening or exciting. This reminded me of an (A level) psychology text book, too clinical and too general to make this taboo and little explored subject come alive."
5,The nitty-gritty of D/s relationships,"This book is one of the very few ethnographies existing about people who live in intentional power exchange relationships as a significant facet of their personal lives. It was groundbreaking when it came out, and to my knowledge no work has since come close to sharing D/s relationships through the participants' eyes in quite this manner, It is a stellar work of sociology for the bdsm community, and well worth reading for anyone who wants to gain some insights into why people choose to do D/s and erotic power relationships."
3,Be prepared,Seems great until you find out RCBS shell holders do not fit. Prepare to buy all Hornady shell holders. This helpful little fact is not mentioned in the product description.
5,Well made product,"In general, Hornady makes very good quality products. I was not disappointed with this case trimmer. It is well made and should last a lifetime. Made In America ! Buy one."
4,Great trimmer,"I have used a few case trimmers and with out a doubt, this one rules. Easy setup and great cutter. Order without concern"
4,Better than the old one,"I had a cheap lee cutter and spinner stud and while it fit a drill it was killing my hands taking shells on and off it.I decided on this. Hornady makes good bullets and I decided to go manual because of the easy release cam feature. This product works well. It loses one star because though it is quick to use and works as advertised the fact that there is no measurement of any kind on it and that is a pain. You have to put a sized shell in or go with a cut and measure option until you get the length you want. So I have to use my lee model to get a sized shell if I need to calibrate this cutter.The bottom line is this.It cuts great, it performs consistently, and it is easy on the hands, one more small feature and it would be perfect for the class it's in."
3,Poorly made,Handle broke after about 1100 rounds. It was nice while it lasted. Going to purchase the drill attachment. maybe I will be able to save this trimmer using the attachment.After purchasing the drill attachment I was able to trim 3000 cases with out any problems. It also saved my hand and arm from hurting.
5,The Three Tenors,"How can anyone not love the magical sound of the three tenors in concert, Carreras-Domingo-Pavarotti. A must for any collection"
4,The three tenors.,"This is my favourite,before the formula became ""stale"",it is by no means the best,the Chicago one in my opinion takes that accolade, but the athmosphere on this is special, and domingo's rendition of ""You are my hearts delight"" is a real treat. Some parts are unintentionally funny, such as their duet of ""la vie en rose"" images of ""piaf"" and waif like sparrows dying for love, were conjured up,the look on pavarotti's face said it all. Zubin Mehta conducted with aplomb,and there duet of o solo mio was sublime,the end a rollicking rendition of Nessum Dorma was what a good sing song is all about!"
4,The Three Tenors,"The Italian Opera CollectionThis is one of the best examples of the Three Tenors that I have come accross in a long time; so much so, that I bought the CD instead of downloading it. I bought it in the first for Pavrotti, but the others are quiet good, esspecially Carreras."
1,DEFECTIVE,AFTER PLAYING FEW TIMES - MAYBE 10- IT HAS STARTED JUMPING FROM ONE TUNE TO THE OTHER IN COUPLE OF NUMBERS.. WHAT I MEAN IS IT CUTS THE SONG AND JUMPS TO THE NEXT LINE... I DON'T KNOW IF ONE CAN REPLACE THIS OR THE QUALITY IS SO BAD THAT IT WILL HAPPEN WITH THE REPLACMENT ALSO...
4,Stick to the classical arias,"Yesterday I had to record one side of a 90 minute tape. So I had to cut this CD down to 45 minutes. I found I ended up cutting Granada and three of the mixed trio tracks: Tonight, Memory and Wien. The resulting 44 minutes is really superior. I couldn't get Memory within the time, but you can easily bag all the others (Tonight, etc.) and vastly improve this CD."
5,I guess I am a dummy!!! It's still awesome!,"I have read this described as opera for dummies so I guess I should be included in those dummies! This was my first ""known"" exposure to opera when I was in my teens. I still cherish the memory of sitting and watching this on PBS with my dearly departed mother! This is an awesome album and opera snob or not I will always enjoy every song on here!"
5,Perfect Gift,I purchased this CD as a gift for my mother after Pavarotti died. She talked it about how it was her absolute favorite of all the 3 Tenor CD's. She was overjoyed to get it and plays it almost every day. It is a wonderful CD for those that love tenors and Pavarotti.
3,More about climbing than i ever needed to know,"Was hoping for something close to ""Glass House"" but disappointed. Way too much mountain climbing lingo for me. Well written, fair character development. Not for me."
4,A wonderful novel!,"I picked up this highly absorbing novel at an airport bookstore quite by chance a few years ago and I remain absolutely amazed by it. It does a marvelous job of plotting the twists and turns in the lives of the two generations of parents and children involved in the story and is absolutely spot-on at describing the subtle and not-so-subtle differences between wartime and post-war Britain. I subsequently read several of this author's other works, including The Glass House and The Gospel of Judas, and found them disappointing, perhaps because they attempt too broadly to cover too much, whereas The Fall effortlessly scales both the peaks and the depths of human existence in a deceptively modest mountaineering-based tale."
3,ho hum,"this is not a ""brilliant"" novel and it is not great literature. its just a nice soap opera type novel which reads easily and doesn't require too much thinking except for the technical mountain climbing parts since I know little about that. I must admit though It's not so easy getting an art gallery and becoming famous overnight. that I do know. Seemed a bit ""yeah, right"" to me."
4,"Its a good book, enjoyed it",interestingHelped bring the period of Louis XIII & Louis XIV into view.I had check it out at the local librarylike it enough to buy it.
5,Pac-Man World 3 Rock!!!!,A new dimension of Pac-Man Game that is fun to play and will give you hours of adventure game for all age.
3,It was ok...,"It wasn't like the best game in world, tho it is really funny. The cut scenes are the hilarious, but the game itself is very tedious. I would have rather rented the game than to have bought it. Not a bad game, just one I'd play when I'm bored."
3,Price is Great,I purchased this game for my nine year old son. It's not one of his favorite games but he enjoys playing a variety of different games. The price was great and affordable.
5,Everything you NEED to know about the construction process,"This book is an indispensable resource. It is appropriate for home remodels, new home builders, developers, and anyone getting started in the construction business. Read it and you will be able to converse professionally with architects, engineers, builders, and subcontractors. This is not a technical book on how to frame a house or plumb a bathroom. Rather, it gives you an insight into the construction process and a game plan to make sure that you are ready to deal with construction professionals. Amy Johnston's checklists and recommendations for various parts of the process are spot on. Follow her guidance and you will save thousands in time and money and navigate your way through the construction process with confidence."
2,NOT for Owner builders,"This book was easy reading and was recommended by Amazon after I bought another book on owner building. If you are hiring a contractor, this may be the book for you, but if you are contracting the home yourself, ie: built by owner with you being the general contractor, this book is not the one to buy."
2,The book is OK,The book is ok. it tooks 12 days for me to recieve it. I once thought it was lost. But the book is ok
5,very useful,"I'm currently entertaining the idea of building our second home. This book is not only VERY informative; it's an easy read and easy to understand. Great points to consider, and ways to save some money."
4,Worth the Price,Thi book will certainly open your eyes and what to look out for. Especially if you are planning to build from ground up. I am into remodeling older homes but nevertheless good knowledge.
2,Why did I read this?,"This book should have either covered a narrower base, or covered it's broad base more carefully. Halfway through I realized that about the only point I really was getting was ""the East hates the West, in particular the Muslims hate the Jews."" There were lots more specifics, but I didn't feel as if there was enough context for them to help. Instead the specific examples clouded the meaning for me and distracted me from the real theme. I had to finish it because I read if for a class, but unless you have to read it...don't. You can find much better writing."
2,If only Said could have read this..,"I have started reading this book and I will say the first thing that caught my attention is the title "" The west in the eyes of its enemies""Immediately I have begun to think that Occidentalism can not be the invert of Orientalism (maybe at least a failed attempt at an invert) because Orientalism is not the east in the eyes of its enemies. Orientalism was formed as a way to firstly understand the middle east definitely through imperalist powers, but Orientalism has affected even those who are not 'enemies' of the west. and I would argue has lead to islamophobia, while there is not a direct racism (that I know of) directly negatively shaping and affecting the lives of ""white"" people the way other groups of people are affected.The title appears to be a strict focus on those who do not like the west, and those are not the only stereotypes that should be taken into account.But hey, most americans are obese, is that a fair assessment of the west? i do not know.."
3,confusing,"What a strange book. It's a thin volume about a subject that I have always wanted to get a grip on, and yet it's mostly confusing. Ironically, the actual concept of Occidentalism is poorly defined by the authors, and the book never recovers. The authors fail to explain the many paradoxes of Westernization, including the most recent bifurcation between most of Europe and the US and England mess. However, it is not a total loss, and at under 150 pages, I still recommend it with 3 stars."
3,A mish mash of ideas about anti-western feelings.,"This is an appealing and timely subject, especially with Islamic fundamentalists running around and setting off bombs. Buruma and Margalit argue that this Western anti-Western feelings originated in Europe itself and spread through to Russia and China, and then the Middle East. This is a short book, and they cover this anti Western thesis broadly. This results in some uneven thoughts about what they are trying to prove. Broadly speaking, there may be some truth to their assertions, but such a short book will not prove their thesis.This is a thought provoking book. However, the focus is too broad, and the evidence might be skimpy. German fascists, nihilists, anarchists, Islamic fundamentalists, Japanese nationalists, and others might be anti-Western, but the link to each other is tenuous at best."
5,The content of this book...,"...is very much second to its great and epic title. If you've read Orientalism, this is your opportunity to witness the defence. I enjoyed it immensely, but it's far too concise, and my other point of criticism would be that the non-West here is predominantly the Middle East or the Muslim/Arab world, whereas the Japanese, Hindu, and, most important, the Chinese views are largely overlooked. Someone already said that it isn't a history book, only a fancy essay, really... but one that has gained cult status. 5/5!"
3,"good introduction, but not much on direct cause of terrorism","A good introductory book on the subject. Buruma has been writting extensively on Japan, China, and other far east countries. So, it is a surprise to read a brief account on some of the historical figures from 19 century German and Russian occidentalists. Of course, examples are also drawn from Japan and China. However, it is weak and not convicing on why Al Qaeda attacks the west and particularly the US."
1,Don't buy this one,"I purchase this instrument twice. The first time there were black specks in the lense, so it was returned. The second time was worst, i.e. same black specs but the thing didn't work at all. I have also checked this manufacturer's other models out and most come with the disturbing black specks in the lense. This isn't a quality optical product."
5,Incredible Range Finder,I use this great product when playing golf and while hunting. Plus it is just fun to have and a great discussion item. It is very accurate and precise.
2,Not very refined,"I was disappointed. Why would I pay money to hear a recording complete with split and miss-centered notes in the high brass?There are also intonation issues in the woodwinds at times. I agree that it does have some great moments, but there are better recordings of these works out there. I suggest looking elsewhere for a good recording."
3,Disappointment,"I bought this book in hardcover, just as I did with ""Earthquake Weather"". Boy, was I disappointed. Now don't get me wrong, I am a huge fan of Mr Powers. His California ""trilogy"" simply blew me away. I read it many times. However here are my thoughts on ""Declare"". If I wanted to read a good spy novel, I would read Le Carre. This book has too little action, too much buildup, too many details. It reads like a travelogue, with a sprinkle of curious historical facts and fictions. What a disappointment. After two weeks, I am still struggling to finish the tome."
3,Whew!!!,"I just finished Declare and it's my first Tim Powers read. On the good side is almost everything there is to like about a book. I like both espionage and occult fiction so the subject matter couldn't be better. The main characters were interesting and fully fleshed-out, and the plot was interesting. But I just found it tedious to get through. It is a long book and it took me forever to finish it. I didn't find it to be a compulsive page-turner, to say the least. But obviously lots of other people did enjoy it, so it's probably just me. If you're going to tackle it, it would be a good idea to read the Wikipedia entries for Lawrence of Arabia and especially Kim Philby if you're not already familiar with their stories because they do figure prominently in the book."
2,too slow-going,"I liked the concepts in this book a lot. The writing is also good. But the progression of the plot was far too gradual, and I gave up relatively early on."
1,Like a dusty old stuffed trout mounted on the wall,"This book is like a visit to the taxidermist: old, stale, stuffed, dusty, musty. How did it get such good reviews? There must be lots of people who like anything in the spy genre. Nothing new here, just a rehash of all the cliches, without any wit to liven them up. Hale is boring & not very believable. Skip it. You want intelligent cold war thrillers, try early Len Deighton, or Nelson DeMille's ""The Charm School""."
5,Wow!,"What a tour de force of ingenuity and complexity. I think that Declare is one of the best dark fantasy books of the year. Its seamless blend of the cold-war thriller a la LeCarre and supernatural dark fantasy is an exciting mix. Even though I only know bits and pieces of the intrigue surrounding Kim Philby and his part in the Cold War, Powers' storytelling drew me in completely. His Andrew Hale is a sympathetic character continually manipulated by forces (and politics). A very satisfying read and my favorite of Powers' novels."
2,"Good read, but many, many typing errors","The first 100 pages are an interesting read (I'm currently at page 100), however, the kindle version contains a LOT of typing errors which spoil the reading experience.The errors include:arbitrary spaces inside words, e.g.: ""gent ly"", ""ser vice"", ""re instatement"", ""Dor chester"", ""En gland"", ""ner vous""hardcoded hyphenations which are probably a left-over from the printing version: e.g. ""Trots-kyite"", ""pre-emptive"", ""electro-magnetic"", ""Switzer-land"", ""Quai d'Or-leans"", ""corre-sponded""Miss-spelled german words, e.g ""Deutsche Allgemiene Zeitung"" instead of ""Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung"", ""Gleinecker Bridge"" instead of ""Glienicker Bridge"",All german umlauts are missing.normal typing errors, e.g. eybrows.Especially the huge amount of errors of the first two types is ridicilous, since they are easily detected by a normal spellchecking program.I hope there will be a corrected version available soon."
3,Not as engaging as his other works,"If you are a Tim Powers aficianado, by all means read this book; but if you compare this to the power of Declare or the fun of his early books (Deviant's Palace, for example) this book deals too much with detail and not enough with anything that made me care about the characters or events. Declare just didn't draw me in. An interesting intellectual exercise, but not a great book."
4,"""How do you keep a reader in suspense?... I'll tell you in the last third of the book.""","This is a typical Tim Powers novel, in that it takes two or three readings before you begin to understand all the ideas he's packed into it and start to get the story. The novel jumps around in time like crazy. The purpose of this is to keep the reader in the dark as much as possible until the big reveal at the end. I found it quite confusing, but that's what you sign up for with Powers. If you're looking for a light, casual read, stay away. If you want something meaty and challenging, you will probably enjoy it."
5,Little-known classic 1960's country star,"-------------------------------------------------Dick Curless""The Long Lonesome Road""(Omni Recording Corporation, 2011)-------------------------------------------------Maine's rural crooner Dick Curless was one of the great regionally-based country stars of the 1950s and '60s... In 1965 he broke through nationally with the somber novelty single, ""A Tombstone Every Mile,"" one of the all-time great trucker tunes, and became known as a leader of the ""trucker music"" scene. This disc is a much-welcome collection of classic material; as with other Omni albums it makes some unconventional choices along with the hits and favorites... Highly recommended! (DJ Joe Sixpack, Slipcue Guide To Country Music)"
5,The Long Lonesome Road,"Great!!! I would highly recommend!!! This is a truly worthwhile CD to purchase. Dick Curless goes a long way back in my memory, and the memory is always good."
3,Best time in America,"Yeah this was the best time in American History, Everyone worked together to get this gob done and WE did it ! with good old American know how."
5,The triumphant return of melody to rock! A great debut!,"Check out this combo - a powerful, liquid voice, and a driving rock beat balanced against innovative melodies. Melissa's original lyrics in each song reflect an inner battle between a wistfully sweet, other-worldy spirit that is tormented by a reality-based cynical rage. The tension produces poetic reflections, behind sometimes surprising melodic shifts and change-ups, that will take you someplace you've already been and let you re-experience it in a new way. This is an artist who really lets you inside. It's a rare opportunity and uniquely compelling music - experience it!"
3,"There is wisdom in there, if you can find it","This text is well known and required by the MTA for its CMT program. Its author is well studied and an expert at technical analysis and has a good historical approach. HOWEVER, his writing style is horrid. I am a fully licensed securities professional and have done technical analysis for a considerable amount of time. Even when I know what he is trying to say I personally find it almost impossible to understand some of his paragraphs. Throw in some typographical errors and some paragraphs are too obtuse to bother trying to decipher. Further, the charts in this book are not the best. They are all so compressed his examples are difficult to find and seldom marked. Its hard to find the early part of a year when the whole year is about an tenth of an inch. Buy this book if you have to or if you can read his style easily that you see in the sample provided. If not there are equally good books on the same subject out there."
1,Everyone else is too nice...,"One person mentioned typos. Another mentioned poor writing. Still another mentioned how Pring seems to give no clear stance (""the price will always move up if the chart looks like this picture, but it might move down"" <--- read that 4-5 times a page and it gets ridiculous!). Now allow me to mention what you SHOULD buy instead of this book: an interactive CD that Amazon sells for almost half of what the producing-company sells for on their website and it is incredibly instructive: InTeLyze.I am not associated with InTeLyze in any way and I was thoroughly impressed --- right after being severely disappointed that I wasted my money on Pring's book. I am very educated and have a finance background, but pretty new to TA... and I felt like a complete idiot reading Pring's book. It wasn't me... it was horribly poor teaching."
3,Major Layout Problems!,"While the book is generally well organized and presents materials helpful to the beginning technical trader in simple terms with examples, visual organization of the book leaves the reader page flipping and frustrated. Rarely are the graphics or charts which are referred to in the text on the same or nearby page. I constantly find myself having to turn pages and search out which chart is being referenced, a very detracting exercise when trying to study technical analysis!"
2,Very difficult to read and can never get to the point.,"I found the book very difficult to read, and filled with fluff that I found unnecessary. Some of the information I found could've been covered in 1 page that were devoted to 10 pages. I would not recommend this book."
3,Lots good information but horribly written,"This book has a lot of good information on technical analysis but due to his poor writing style in order to understand what he is saying you might have to read reread & reread and I'm sure that you wont understand everything he is trying to bring out, the charts are really complicated to follow they are mostly not on the same page as the reading material that has you keep turn page back & fourth a few times to get through one chart besides for the fact that they are very small& busy(try to find a peak & through in a 1/4 of a centimeter with MA's trend lines right in middle of it)there are many other good books on technical analysis out there"
3,This book can be written in 100 page its too long !,"Martin Pring have contributed a lot to technical analysis, but the down part of his book is it can be summarized to 100 page or 150 max, I find the book to long with unnecessary words, on the other hand the book can be considered as a good reference. Now a days he have released an updated version of this I recommend looking at it. And I hope it's not a 1000 pages with only 200 pages of good material."
4,Good book,"Goes through all the basics of trendlines etc, I really enjoy Pring's writing style and analogy's. This book alone won't turn you into a profitable trader, but will give you the core you need to seek out a good system and understand it."
3,"It is a good book for who likes indicators, particularly oscillator, mainly ROC.","It is a good book for who likes indicators, particularly oscillator, mainly ROC. When the author doesn't talk about or use ROC to explain something in the book, and it is hard to find a chapter in over 600 pages where he doesn't do that; It is able to learn something really good. There are some good sections with important information, it is true; the very end (epilogue) has good tips but I just don't know if it is profitable expend so much time reading all it. There is a old maxim in Brazil that say ""Encheu muita linguia""! ...rs"
1,TWO BAD ONES IN A ROW,"First one last less than 24 hours before it had huge green splotches all over the screen and refresh rate went to heck. Blacks looked green. Sent back to Amazon with no problem. Made 5-30-2003.Second one lasted 6 days then had a red line constant on the screen in the middle. Sent back to Amazon, no problem, refunded money. Built 5-30-2003No dead pixels, great pciture, super low price at the time of $449 free ship when it worked but 2 failed in a row is two too many would never buy another Cornea. Dell and Hp make much more reliable LCD's we buy hindreds at work and NEVER had they sort of problems EVER"
5,Excellent montor,"Have been using this for a couple of years now.It has funcitoned flawlessly and looks great.(And the size of the screen even appears bigger thanthan on my 20"" iMac.) Very satisfied."
2,Text shaddow / blurry,"First - I like the system overall. Pictures look great and setup was simple with XP. BUT BUT BUT - the text is broken / shaddowy / blurry (all text, all sizes, all colors). I went to the Cornea web site and the support section is terrible (10 FAQ's - if that). The problem is that the text has a shaddow around it (with missing pixels in places). I was told to change the resolution (tried it to no avail. CAN ANYONE HELP ME (please e-mail me at tim@higham.org). Thanks!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Give this one a pass,"This book was long winded, pointless and dull. The title is completely miss leading. There is no nightmare, it is a lack luster romance with little romance."
3,Make mine Callas,"I think I agree with reviewers Moojen and ""wachanda,"" if what they mean to say is that Sutherland's Italian pronunciation is annoyingly bad (""diction"" is something else, guys; it means ""choice of words"".) I realize many fans don't speak Italian, so it doesn't bother them so much, or if they do speak Italian, might just say it's irrelevant what language she's using...just listen to that voice! Well, I found the poor pronunciation quite distracting. The words to an opera are a crucial part of the drama, and to slur them is inexcusable, even for la Stupenda. She's way over the hill for this one anyway, and Pavarotti's no spring chicken either. Joan's last at bat here; too bad it wasn't a home run. For a much better, and truly moving Traviata, try the 1955 performance at La Scala with Callas and di Stefano, background noise and all."
3,method,"The authenticity of Joan's performance is unmatched, its hard to imagine how she could sound more consumptive without pathologically being so."
4,Great Libretto,"Not much I can add to the previous reviews with one exception, a word about the libretto. Since the demise of the LP boxed sets, the liner notes and libretti have been reduced to a paltry amount or even eliminated in most CDs. Not so, thankfully on this recording. Even though the type size is very small, the excellent, original notes are still there, and include insightful background information. The libretto, in four languages, is the best to be found. This booklet is almost worth the price of the entire package. Hope this helps."
3,"Very pretty, but where's the drama?","Joan Sutherland had a phenomenal coloratura ability, and she uses it to full extent in ""La Traviata,"" one of my favorite operas. However, all she does is produce beautiful sound some of the time (not all the time - she was getting on in years [this recording was made in 1979] and ""moons"" a lot). She doesn't characterize Violetta, she doesn't enunciate at all - it sounds like she's giving a concert rather than portraying a character. Pavarotti sings well enough, but I don't really respond to his Alfredo. Manuguerra is an adequate Germont père. Bonynge provides some much-needed dramatic tension to this set - but it's not enough. Definitely not ideal."
4,Pavarotti is masterful!,This recording is really wonderfully done. Pavarotti is masterful on it. Sutherland is her usual glorious self. The recording is done in top notch quality. A wonderful recording all together.
5,Great Christmas gift,My father wanted this opera so I of course went shopping on Amazon. He was very pleased with his gift and listens to it daily.
2,Disappointment.,"Dame Joan Sutherland was a great singer indeed. Her high notes were unchallengeable. But her portrait of Violetta is a very dull one. One of Sutherlands' faults throughout her career was her diction. And in this recording it is no exception. At the most dramatic moments in the opera Sutherland isn't very convincing. She isn't being helped at all by the conducting of Bonynge, who fails to give real thrust to the drama. Pavarotti gives a splendid performance as Alfredo Germont. But Matteo Manuguerra lacks in authority as the stern patriarch."
2,Minor correction to description,"There are many, many flavour profiles amongst olive oils currently produced across the world with modern know-how and technology. That means that there are many other very distinctive, medium to intense styles besides those of Tuscany. Should the description of the book include a statement around an emphasis on Tuscan oils?"
1,Serious problem with Amazon reviews,"If this largely worthless blather is so well reviewed by amazon editors and the ""public"", there is something seriously wrong with this system. Krasner has a total of 15 pages of this book on varieties of olive oils, much of which is generic fluff comments.I want a book that seriously evaluates olive oils. This surely ain't it.If you want some recipes on how to use olive oil, discussion on the health benefits of olive oil, suggestions on how to taste olive oil, this might be a useful book. I gave it as a gift to my wife. I am embarrassed."
4,good knife,"Great knife. really light doesn't add weight to your backpack. I've had other survival knives that were bulky and weigh a ton. Knife comes sharp as a razor, so good I bought one for my buddy."
2,truck knife,"This knife has a thin blade and the blade wire edged during sharping. I have a HighQ,Top Q, utility and a 6"" bladed one that all have better steel and thicker blades. The handle is softer and you can feel the shorter tang. I will use it for a fishing or beater blade."
5,great all-around woods knife,"To say that I'm hard on knives is a huge understatement, which is why this quickly became my favorite knife. My red handled stepchild gets beaten on a regular basis and has yet to let me down. It's super easy to resharpen to hair shaving status, and keeps its edge fairly well. Its not the prettiest knife around, the spine had the classic crappy stamped knife roughness that I ground smooth soon after getting it, but it feels surprisingly good in hand. There's no other way to describe the sheath other than... it sucks. Minute cosmetic issues and a crappy sheath aside, this knife is a solid performer and has been the best all around woods knife I've found so far. Plus IF you manage to break it, you're only out [...] bucks."
3,Review,The good:The price.It was shipped promptly.I like the knife. Especially the red part. As another poster mentioned it is a real pain in the ass to set your knife down and then be unable to see it.The bad:The blade was pitted. Not a lot but enough. It does not ruin it but it's not shiny and new looking.
2,Blemished blades,I purchased five of the Mora knives and all five were pitted and dull finished. Where I goofed was to try and polish the blades after which I knew I could not return them. Guess I will have to put a patina on them so they don't look so bad.
4,Nice knife. Not so nice handle.,"FYI, the blade reads ""Mora of Sweden"", and there's a little product code sticker on the back of the plastic sheath that says ""Made in Sweden"". Mine did not come in an individual box.I have no doubt this knife performs very well. I am a little disappointed about the plastic plug in the end of the handle. It is a good value buy."
5,86 VW GTI Fuel Filter,"I bought this fuel filter for my project car, a 1986 VW Golf GTI.Great Price, right fit, know problems!!!!!Thanks Amazon!!!"
3,Good overview,"The book is well-documented. Easy to understand graphs and charts are all over the book. It lacks depth, but it skims a number of surface areas very well. Good for school research or intellectual curiosity, but probably redundantly useless for the newspaper professional."
3,Handle broke,The wooden handle broke after several weeks usuage which was about 10 days usuage for about a half hour a day..
5,"fast work on bigger branches, into smaller branches, small 2x4"", crate wood, light enough to spilt. reconmend highly. good spilt","great for the person who uses his wood piles, wood shed stacks for kindling.fast work on medium branches and pile clean up."
5,Wonderful performance of incredible works,"Dvorak's 7th symphony is a thrilling work, from beginning to end. It is a stormy, dramatic piece, and has become one of my favorite symphonies of any composer. Though it enjoys less performances than his 8th or 9th symphonies, many critics consider it his finest symphonic work.The Cleveland orchestra is in top form here. The sound quality of this CD is superb. I should also mention that the timpanis are particularly well-recorded. In many recordings they sound mushy and reverberate too much, but here, they are wonderfully punctuated and emphatic.$ is a great price for a recording of this quality. I would highly recommend it for anyone who hasn't heard the 7th or 8th symphonies or who has but is looking for an excellent recording of them."
5,An Outstanding Disc at Any Price!!,"Dvorak is a grossly under-appreciated composer. His music is, for the most part, very pleasing. This disc contains perhaps his two greatest masterpieces, the 7th and 8th symphonies. Not only are the selections terrific, but the interpretations by Dohnanyi and the Cleveland Orchestra are superb! Add to that the great sound, and this is a CD to rush out and buy at any price! Yet it is available for a pittance! By all means, if you are, as I am, an unabashed fan of great orchestral and symphonic music, rush out and add this magnificent CD to your collection."
2,"$5.99 was borderline ok, but $10/month is too much","The paper used to be $6/mo, but is now $10. For just a tad over $5 a month, I was willing to put up with the fact that the paper had only a relatively small amount of unique content I hadn't already ready elsewhere. But for $10/mo, and the time it takes me to page through it, there's not enough benefit for me to continue subscribing.No thanks. I'll check out the online site briefly for local news, but I'll spend the majority of my time reading stuff from other places (local neighborhood blogs, sports blogs, Publicola, Seattlest, etc.)."
1,Delivered too late,Usually comes between 7-8am PT. Too late for a newspaper. This is a fatal flaw in the Kindle's newspaper service. Fortunately the NY times is always there before 5am.
2,Too much money for not enough paper,"There is a lot of missing content in the Kindle edition of the Seattle Times. Also, there are no photographs included with the articles. Many of the other newspapers provide more substantial content and photos. I realize that we pay a lower subscription price for this newspaper, but I would rather have the content. Until the Seattle Times has more to offer for its Kindle readers, I have decided to cancel my subscription."
2,Not as much content as other Kindle Newspapers,"I have been receiving the Seattle Times every since I bought my Kindle over 4 years ago. At first, I thought the lack of content was due to the new format. However, nothing has changed over the last 4 years. If anything, there is less content today. I occasionally purchase other newspapers on my Kindle. They include photos and other images as well as much more content. So, I know it is possible and the Times just chooses not to include everything. I am wondering what I am paying for since the full content is on their website and not the Kindle edition.I want to get the local news so that is why I have stuck with the Times for so long. Now I am just frustrated and thinking of subscribing to another paper. I will watch the 10pm news to find out what is happening in Seattle."
2,Partial Stories,"Most definitely not worth $9.99 per month. The stories are not the complete versions available in the paper version. I'll simply read the website. If the Seattle Times wants to charge this amount, it needs to include the FULL text of the stories. Cancelling."
1,Is it worth the price?,"Barely. It's frequently late, lacking in content, and is usually filled with yesterday's print articles.The version I get on my Ipod touch FOR FREE is updated regularly, has the full print content, and has more of today's articles.My ipod touch is too small to read on the stationary bike or I'd discontinue the kindle version."
3,Please Add Photos & Diagrams,"I've never subscribed to a paper before the Kindle and overall this is a good paper, but...Add some photos. The display on the kindle seems better than newsprint so add some B&W; images with the text. Also another edit pass would be a good idea. And whenever an & is in the text it's not quoted properly... (just little nits)I'd like to know that the content is pretty consistent article wise with the paper version. I haven't compared so I don't know."
2,Sammamish Reader,"The Seattle Times Kindle edition needs to show a ""weather"" page link that is easily found. Evidently the ""Kindle Edition"" has no weather details. It was 7:20am plus before the edition arrived on my Kindle, this a problem when drinking coffee before work in the morning."
3,price increase is disgusting,"I find it more than appalling that the Kindle charge for a Seattle Times subscription is rising to $9.99 per month and the home delivery is only $5.35/month. What gall! The electronic version saves the paper so much money in printing and truck/car delivery. Not to mention the fact that the electronic paper comes with less e.g. no coupons and less content. Who is making these ridiculous, bassackwards decisions????"
2,Too much missing,"Wish it did have some picture content, but an even bigger problem is that you subscribe to a regional paper and it has no regional information, such as weather and local issue columns."
2,Late delivery trumps good content,"Agree with others that content is good, but in my trial delivered late 14% of the time. One day didn't arrive until after noon, and today not delivered when I normally read the papaer at 600 am mountain time. Perhaps this is true of pther west coast papers - but it doesn't work for me."
2,Not worth the new price increase,"Delivery has been on time, that is not an issue. Content is lacking, mostly national news, not enough local. Missing a lot of what is in the paper edition. When I travel I want to know what's going on at home. My iPhone can keep me up with world news. I subscribed till they had their price increase to $9.99, it's just not worth it for the content. Online edition has more local and sports."
2,Slow as molasses,"If the paper is STILL not here by the time I get to work at 11am, there's something wrong with that service. If Amazon wants to make this a viable option to the hard copy, they need to bring up the delivery speed."
3,A lot missing,"Too many things missing. First off no weather, that is a huge strike against it. Second I like the comics please include the comics hey I am paying for this just like the hard print. No sports box scores that is just not cool. @ $10 a month they should treat it like a regular subscription, they don't have to deliver it or print it heck I am saving them a ton of money. I will carry this subscription for a while but if i feel like they don't care to make improvements then I can hope the P.I. will get it."
2,Still almost no photos; no weather data,"As a longtime reader of The Times via Kindle I have concluded that Amazon, which controls all the content Kindle readers receive, is not invested in providing a quality product. Those of us who wish to save resources need to protest this lack of services. We are the 99%!!!!!"
2,Limited,"Much less content than my other subscription, Washington Post. The Times is a smaller paper and is cheaper, but it seems they are just putting less articles in their Kindle edition. Recent editorial stated that they are discontinuing syndicated columnists in print (assume this means Kindle too)...just getting too thin to justify my money."
1,Biased Editorial Board,"The conservative bent of the Seattle Times editorial board leaves much to be desired. They rarely dig deeply into the issues, especially those regarding education, and often voice misguided and misinformed opinions. They need to do the necessary homework to be considered credible."
2,To long,To long for so little. Get more information from the Seattle Times paper site. It was alot of nothing. Needs to have an index like for every Section of the paper.
4,I like the Times,"The Times is thin these days, but its a necessary read if you want to know what's happening in King County. I'm especially a fan of the obituaries; they are a great record of the regions history, and they are full of good news of the happy families and life's accomplishments. I suppose everyone has some bad news in their past, but whats the good of dwelling on that?"
5,Amanda is the coolest chick in the whole world,"This is a great record that only gets better with every listen, and Amanda is an artist worth supporting. Buy this record!"
4,"Good quality, worth more than they are charging!","GHOSTS ON THE LOOSE is nice and sharp, with good audio. This spooky entry involves BELA LUGOSI and some Nazi spies.SPOOKS RUN WILD is a little softer but the audio is still good. The boys meet BELA LUGOSI again, this time in a spooky old house full of secret passageways!"
1,Poor quality prints,"I like the bowery boy, but the quality of these transfers are questionable. It would be nice to see a decent print of these films with half way decent audio quality."
4,"You MUST hear ""Spinning around...""","If you liked the record: ""Are you gonna go my way"",you MUST listen to ""Spinning Around Over You"".It has the same FUNK that the whole record has.I was watching a movie called ""Reality Bites"" andI first heard it and saw it on the soundtrack.Then while searching through used CD's I found this Single.""B-Side Blues"" is rough and barely OK.The highlight of this CD is ""Spinning..."""
2,"Many illustrations, but primitive in context","Just a few pages on a most simple fighting techniques. Interesting chapter on booby traps. If you're looking for a good martial art book, this is not it."
1,high color cover/low color information,"nice looking cover, but very low in any type of information. many drawings that are not related to the title. just the very basic information at best. i would not recommend"
3,Janov has written better...,"This is the latest book regarding Primal Therapy. Nothing newhere that was not included in ""Primal Scream"" or ""New PrimalScream."" This book is less passionate than his others.Still, not bad."
5,Simply a wonderful book!,"Perhaps the best tesaiment to this book is that people in my office have ordered three of them since I brought it in for someone to see. The authors give you an excellent overview of how to use the various types of commercial smokers available on the market. They also provide a convincing explanation of the value of rubs and of course provide many good rub recipes. Since I bought this book, I won't eat anybody's barbeque except mine"
3,Feh,"I had great hopes for this book, as I thought it would provide me with a range of interesting recipes to go with my already well-used smoker. Instead I found a mish-mash of recipes that, though they use the smoker, do not really put it to best use. While I'm sure the book will get used, it won't get nearly as much use as other books on my shelf."
4,A wonderful source book!,"A good friend gave me this book and got me started cooking again after years of eating out or peanut butter at home. Now, I've dropped off the deep end. I really never knew smoking was sooo easy. The authors provide all the basic information about smoking foods, then provide recipes for running (er, cooking) wild. Though the recipes are easy enough, the end products turn out wonderfully complex and immeasurably delightful. Any book that reccomends gin and brown sugar in the same recipe deserves your attention."
3,About average,"Nothing to write home about. The author really tries to err on the side of ""fresh"" and ""light"" and ""healthy"". The result is sort of like reading an extended edition of an issue of Bon Appetit."
4,smoker cookbook,"this is the second book that I have purchased, we had one and we bought the second one for a friend who has just bought a smoker, I would definetely recommend this book. The recipes are very good and thorough and the cooking times are right on."
5,Wonderful Reference,This is a great reference book. It was shipped very fast. I was extremely pleased with my purchase and the transaction.
1,A Major Disappointment,"Don't waste your money. Their first book. Smoke & Spice, was one of the best I own. The success must have gone to their heads. It's a shame that they will surely make a lot of money for this poor effort only because of the first books quality."
3,"San Francisco is great, but not here...","Generally San Francisco recordings are among my favorites. The Richard Strauss recordings under Blomstedt are rich and clean, and powerfully convey colors and character. However, this recording of Carmina is hardly up to speed with any of that. The performance is dull and lacks character, though the soloist do quite well throughout. I recommend the Philharmonia recording under Ricardo Muti, or the Carl Orff approved recording with the Berlin Opera under the direction of Eugene Jochum. The SFS recording is a nice addition to the Orff colection, if for nothing else than variety."
4,Things Not Seen,"Things Not Seen by Andres Clements tells about how a boy named Bobby struggles with invisibility. He meets this girl Alicia and she was blind. Bobby told her he was invisible. Alicia did not beleive Bobby, then she asked a man if he could see Bobby. The man looked at her like she was crzy. I thought this was a great book."
3,Things not seen,"Clements, Andrew. (2002). Things not seen. New York:Scholastic books, ISBN # 0-439-45620-7AdventureSynopsis: Bobby is a teenager that lives in a downtown community of Chicago. He is a normal teen, a lot of friends, but there is one thing, HE IS INVISIBLE!!! He used 2 be normal until one morning. This book shows that being invisible in Chicago isn't very fun or easy. Will he overcome this strange happening or will he be left the way he is, forever?Review:Things not seenCritic: I like this book because it had a lot of suspense to it. Although it did take awhile to get to the main part, I still liked it. This book was also kind of bland and boring and it took awhile to get to the ending of the book. I didn't really get the point to this book. If you liked the book ""Frindle"" you will like this book. I gave this book 3 out of 5 stars.Jorge Sanchez"
3,Review,"I thought the book things not seen was a good book with a good storyline because it keeps you in suspense and wondering what would happen next like when Bobby figures out how to fix his problem. The onley thing I do not like about this book is was how it ends, it should have more detail on what happens next.I give this book 3 stars for being a good book and because it needs a better ending. I would recommend this book to anyone except people who like to read action books because this book has no action. Overall this is a good book and I think you should definitely read it."
3,Thing Not Seen,"I think that this book is boring but, there parts that are good . I like when the boy name Bobby is invisible and he wanders off in the streets. What I dislike is that most of the time he stays home and does nothing. I think that the author needs to fix the begining of the book but, if I were going to rate this I would give it 3 and a half stars."
5,Wonderful,"One word: Wow. I bought this book at a book fair and was attracted to it because of the unusual title. I was stuck on this book and didn't put it down unless to sleep!! I finished it in 2 days because of this, and almost got in trouble with my teacher for not putting it down. ANyone who has not read this book should! It is wonderful!!!"
5,"""Things Not Seen""","One of the best books I've read this year is ""Thiigs Not Seen"" it's about a boy who wakes up one morning,goes down stairs & relizes that his parents can't see him. Bobby is a regular 15 year old until his life gets flip-flopped.If you want to find out why Bobby becomes invisible & what kind of things he endures you have to read ""Things Not Seen"" by Andrew Clemnts."
3,Things not seen,Things not seen is a breataking book it got third on our class booklist cause was a book action and some of the kid though it had to much info like when said he didn't have on any cloths but if he had on cloths he would be seen.But his parents didn't have a good cover story to tell why he was not there.But you know parents they not like they used to.But the girl he meets is a big help for someone how it blind. But it a great book.It made me laugh it made cry it was a good book and the ending will take you away.Another thing there is someone lest that is not seen.
1,Irritating,"Things Not Seen is a foolish fancy of the imagination. Nothing is particularaly in-depth nor believable in any fantasy world. I nodded off more than once from lack of interest, and at the end I was relieved that I would no longer suffer from it. Again, Andrew Clements fails to produce a jewel."
3,This Book has its Ups and Downs,I feel this book has its ups and downs. It is a little hard to understand but the plot is interesting. But I do not get the father of Bobby(the main character). He is an embarrassment to physicists. They don't talk most of the time when they should. They make fun of science. Then what is weird is that people believe Bobby is invisible when he tells them. This book is just about a teenager named Bobby who turns invisible one day. Then 2 days later he meets a blind girl while his parents were in the hospital. When Alicia(the blind girl) felt Bobby and thought Bobby was naked. Bobby then said he was invisible. She then asked a guy on the streets if she was taller than the person next to her. The man said there was no one. So then she knew Bobby was naked. Then Alicia tells her family and so Bobby's and Alicia's family work on Bobby. I would say this book is okay. I wouldn't recommend this book to any of my friends.
4,Things Not Seen review,"(...)i am in the 8th grade, and i just read Things not seen by Andrew clemets.

My favorite part was the ending. I liked the ending because it was a happy one.I would recomend this book.c.c.
4,things not seen,"I liked this book for a bunch of reasons. It kept me on a joy ride from start to finish. But there are some bad things about the book, like there is too much dialogue, it mentions to much nudety, and has too much sciency stuff, like in almost all of the chapters, the main character, Bobby Phillips, goes invisible and when he goes outside, he has to get naked so nobody will flip out when they see floating clothes. I would seriously recommend it to any readers. I give it a four out of five star rating."
2,Things not seen,"(...) I am in 8th grade. I just read things not seen by Andrew Clements. My opinion of this book is I did not like it becaus it was a fantasy, and i do not like fantasy. I thought the best part of the book was when he turned invisible. I felt the ending was good because he turns back to a normal person, and lives a normal life. I don't recommend this book."
2,Things Not Seen,My name is M.S. and I am in 8th grade. I just read Things Not Seen by Andrew Clements. My opinion of this book is that I liked it because I like reading about things that can not happen in reality. My favorite part was when he tried to get around town to the library. I felt that the ending was good though because it is exciting to see how he turns back to normal and lives a normal human life. I recommend this book to people who like fantasy books because it is very interesting.

My opinion of this book is that I enjoyed it becuase it actually kept me wanting to read it. I thought the best part was the ending. I felt the ending was excellent because it was so sweet. I do reccomend this book.
3,Mrs. johnson book review,"I thought this was a pretty good book. I thought it was very interesting and a lot of people my age would like to read this book. I thought it was interesting because it is neat to try to figure out how he became invisible. I also thought so because it is also a story about two friends working together and solving problems. One more reason I thought so was because it isn't a confusing book and young readers should be able to understand it. I would recommend this book to a kid my age because it is a fun book to read. Also kids wont get bored reading this story, because when u start reading it you just cant stop reading because it is interesting and fun. That is why this is a great book to read!"
4,Things Not Seen,Things Not Seen is a very good book but it is not as good as a book like the Lord of the Rings or other books like this. This book is about friendship and one of the lessons I learn from this is to never give up. Here is a quick summary of what happens. Theres this regular boy named Bobby but he turns invisible. And he doesn't know where to turn but then when he meets a blind girl named Alicia together they try to turn Bobby back to the way he was. If you want to learn more read Things Not Seen to find out.
5,Things Not Seen,"Anybody who has read or is reading this book has a great choice of books.The book ""THINGS NOT SEEN"" is about a boy named Bobby, who wakes up one morning to find that he's invisible!Him, his father, and his mother try to keep it a secret,but the law is coming into the picture.But then,Bobby goes to the library (naked). When he's in the library, he meets a blind girl. Can Bobby,his parents,Alicia ( the blind girl), and a Alicia's parents solve this mystery an keep this a secret without everything getting out of control?"
5,The best book I've read,"Things not Seen is a book about a narmal 15 year old boy until a serant day that he turns invesable his name is Bobby Phillips. It's a regaular school day when it happens. Bobby gets out of shower and off the mirror. thats when he finds out that he's invisable. Then he looks down and can't see his feet. He runs down the stairs then drinks his drink.

Well, at the end his friend finds away to help. Does it work read to find out."
3,Things Not Seen,"Things Not Seen was a good and a strange book I mean how he turned invisible by the heating blanket.In the book things not seen bobby the one who turns invisible goes to a sience shool because his parents. That would suck also when he turns invisible he gets into a little argument with his dad, sounds like my house.But then his dad goes to get his mom and his dad and mom get into a bad car accident and he is stuck at his house. After a while when hes not at shool some nosey girl from social services comes and gives them a hard time.But what i liked about the book was how he was nice to the blind girl alicia.And helped everyone else who used the blanket. Other than the bad stuff I really liked the book."
4,things not seen,"This book is about a boy named Bobby. One day he wakes up takes, a shower, then looked in a mirror, and he isn't there well he is there but invisable. I liked this book because it wasn't boring it stayed interesting. Once in awhile I got confused because there was too much going on at once. Overall it was a good book and i would recommend it."
4,this is the best book ever!!!,"Things Not Seen, is a book that takes place in modern day Chicago in a suburban town. It involves a teenage boy named Bobby who one day wakes up and is invisible. He is the one that has to figure out what happened to him with the help of his family and a friend or 2 that he meets along the way. He ends up going through many things such as breaking into files and going agents what people say. Bobby is a very independent and shy guy. Going through his experience got a lot more self confident and more thank full. I think this is a great book because it has a lot about friendship and how some teenagers have it way worse then you. This book is good for slow readers and people that like plots, but if you like to get right to the point you might want to try a different book. This book is not a really intense mystery but it does involve some thinking. I would recommend this book to every one and every one should give it a try."
3,Gone missing,"This book is called Things Not Seen. It's about a boy who goes to sleep and wakes invisible. I liked this book because it left you wondering whats going to happen next. I disliked this book because, there's no real action nothing extremely exciting. I would not recomend this book to anyone except those who like this leave you hanging books, just because i'm more of an action kind of person. I give this book a 3 stars, out of 5."
2,eh,it kinda (...)....the first chapter was extremely good and very intriguing. I got 2 page 117 and i couldn't take it anymore....i could have written a better book than this. it was indeed a very good story line but it kind of just....dragged on. W/e
3,Things not seen,"Things not seen is a book ... about a boy that be comes in visable.The boy turns in visable realy quikly.His parents write him a note ,then they leave him.This was my favorite part because I was not exspecting this at all. As you get farther in the book it gets more interesting."
5,The Best Book Ever!!!,A 14-year-old boy Bobby-Robert Phillips wakes up one day invisibel. This is a book filled with adventer and hard times. Bobby meets this lind who he really trusts and have faith in. i recomed this because it proves that even if you are invisibel or blind theres something in you that makes you speacil. You will expecily appereact this book if you are 8 or older. Happy Reading!!
3,Good Read for Middle School,"Things Not Seen is about fifteen-year-old Bobby Phillips, who wakes up one morning to discover that he is invisible.Bobby is thrust into independence when his parents are hurt in a car accident and he must stay alone while they recover. Keeping his condition secret, he travels through the city of Chicago unnoticed and, along the way, forms an unlikely friendship with a girl he meets in the University library. He and his family learn a great deal about themselves and their relationships as they try to understand and reverse what has happened to make Bobby invisible.This is another coming-of-age story, with a science-fiction spin, that makes it modern and, surprisingly realistic."
4,The Best Book Ever,"Yes, I would recommend this book.It's an awesome brain catcher. You'realways having to think aboutsomething. I loved all of the charactersin this book; they all had a differentpersonality. This is a wonderful book Ibelieve everyone should have a chance toread this book. So whenever you go to the librarylook for the book Things Not Seen!!"
3,Good Read,Son needs to read this for school and I thought I would see what it was all about. Interesting story line and will give my son some things to think about when he is done. can not wait to discuss it with him.
4,None,I really enjoyed this book! Clements really out did himself. I recomend this book to anyone below the age of 22 and above 12. Enjoy!!!
5,JOSE''S REVIEW,"Things Not seen By Andrew Clements tells about a boy named Bobby who struggles with invisibility.He is 15 years old and he has a blind friend.He said that his electric blanket made him invisible.Then he goes on the web and meets someone with the electric blanket,too.She is invisible,too.And at last he went to sleep with his electric blanket and he became visible again. It was a good book to read."
5,Review of Thigns Not seen,(...)I am in 8th grade. I just read Things Not Seen by Andrew Clements. My opinion of this book is that I thought it was a good book. I was into it and couldn't put it down. The author is a good writter and at the end of every chapter he kind of stopped it and you wanted to know what would happen next. I thought the best part was when he was with Alicia. There was a lot of love between them and I thought it was sweet. I felt the ending was very good and I wish there was a sequel because it seemed like it ended too soon and I wanted to know what would happen next. I do recommend this book. -K.L.O.
3,The review of things not seen,(...) I am in 8th grade. I just got done reading things not seen by Andrew Clements. My opinion about this book is that it was entertaining and fun to read. It was about a boy that becomes invisible and has to go through some difficulties so that he can go back to normal. I thought the best part was when he found out he was invisble. I felt that the ending was the best part because it was cute and entertaing. It was a very enjoyable book.
3,Things not Seen,(...) I am in 8th grade. I just read Things not Seen by Andrew Clements. My opinion of th is book is good. I dont really like reading but this book was good enough for me to finish it. I thought the best part was when he went to the Sears headquarters to get the list of people who bought the blankets. I felt the ending was good because i did not expect it. I do reccomend this book because its just over all a good book. i dont particularly like reading but it kept me entertained so I do reccomend this book.
4,My pretty little review on this book! ^_^,"My name is K.D.S., and I am in 8th grade. I just read Things Not Seen by Andrew Clements.

I do reccomend this book.KDS"
3,Things Not Seen Review,"(...)I am in 8th grade. I just read Things Not Seen by Andrew Clements. I thought this book was okay, sometimes it got a little unbelievable, and sometimes it was a little repetitve. It was good in the aspect that it made you want to keep reading. I thought the best part was the end when Bobby wanted to go tell Alicia he loved her. I thought the ending left you hanging a little bit. I recommend this book to people who like a little bit of reality mixed with a little bit of fantasy."
4,THings Not Seen,"The book "" Things Not Seen"" is a great book because it makes me want to read more. Bobby is a great character but a little too ambitious because he goes out in the city while he is invisible not knowing how he can get around people, and his parents didn't even know where he was. He was in a tight spot because the cops searched his house but right before his mom made him clean everything so it looked like he hadn't been there.I think that it was a bad idea for Bobby to sleep with his electric blanket because he called someone who had the same blanket that became invisible from it and they became invisible and when he woke up he was visible but something wrong could have happed from doing that. I would recommend this book to middle school aged kids because it's at their grade level and for kids who like fiction.By: Gina"
1,Beyond the Pale,"Things Not Seen by Andrew ClementsRight Off the title of this book should be seen as a warning. I wish I had not seen it or read it or been asked to waste words or original thought to describe it. Much like the ""Witches of Waverly Place"" is an appropriated age-appropriate version of a concept which had some value when done by it's original author (Sol Saks: Bewitched), so too was this book a supposed age-appropriate vehicle based on an appropriated concept (H.G. Wells: The Invisible Man).Two things are missing, or should I venture three: one, the fun; two any opportunity for the reader to add imagination; and three originality.As an added insult, and certainly no favor to our youth, the author depicts a Cal Tech Physicist (with among other honors a degree in Electrical Engineering) and a `cutting edge' U of C professor of astronomy being impotent to apply themselves to problem solving as he draws them bound to an unapproachable quest for data."
4,Things Not Seen,"Bobby Philips is your average fifteen year old boy, until one morning he wakes up and doesn't see himself in the mirror. As time passes by he tries to figure out how to change back and what had happened to him. For Bobby that means no friends, no education, and most importantly no life. Fortunately a blind girl named Alicia helps him get through his problem and helps him change back before it's too late. As his dad the physicist and Alicia's dad the science geek try to figure out what is going on, Bobby has a plan of his own. Sneaking into Sears, putting his life on the line, and trying not to get caught, he finds the solution to his problem, but will his prediction actually work, or will he stay invisible forever?"
4,From an 11 year old,"This book is about a teenager named Bobby, who became invisible. It all started when Bobby used an electric blanket which was not working correctly and turned him invisible.The best part of the book was when Bobby turned invisible and his friend found a way to make him visible again. I didn't like the fact that the book was too short. I would like to see this book turn into a series. My favorite scene was the look on Bobby's parents face when he was drinking orange juice.I would highly recommend this book to other kids my age. The book was very exciting and you won't be able to put the book down."
3,Interesting,"The book explores the interesting concept of being invisible. Bobby, a young boy, wakes up one moring and can't see himself. He now must hide from the world. If he does go out, he must bundle up and wear sunglasses, or walk around naked. His only friend is a blind girl, who accidentally finds out about his invisiblity. Now Bobby must figure out if there is a way out; can he ever live a real life again, or is he condemed to hide from the whole world forever? First he must figure out how this happened, but he doesn't have much time. The school and the government haven't seen him for many weeks, and they are becoming concerned. Will Bobby be able to become visible again? Well read the book to find out.One thing I objected to was that this kid goes places naked to spy on people and discover what is it like to go around town invisible. His clothes don't turn invisible. Because of this you will have to make your own decision on wether you want to read a book with this in it or not."
3,Received book with different cover than expected,"When I received the book, I was surprised to receive a different version (i.e. different publisher, different cover). In the future, please make sure the orders match the advertised image."
5,Domicile re-release,"Domicile was re-released by the band under the name ""Slides in hiding"". The re-release featured all the songs previously available on domicile plus 4 additional unreleased tracks. The re-release was subtitled ""the paine sessions"" named after the engineer that worked with the band. Three tracks from the re-release are available on their ""Mute / Blue Single"""
3,too cute,"very cool and classy, everyone like this one, it goes with demin of all colors and is well made cap."
2,GOOD PRODUCT - WRONG PICTURE,"this product works well. however, it is not the 7500 as shown. it is model 7550. i prefer the model 7500 and Amazon should not mis-represent."
1,Be careful what you buy it for,"Contrary to voluminous advertising it does *not* have anything to allow poaching of eggs. *ANY* eggs. It is also effectively totally lacking in recipes: a grand total of TWO: Green Salmon and really weird Apple something. It might be a decent steamer, I can't tell, because it can't cook what I bought it for, and it doesn't have recipes for anything else I might want to try."
4,Great for struggling readers,I got this for my sophomore English class. It is great for students who are struggling to understand Shakespeare's writing.
5,No Fear Shakespeare: Julius Caesar,This book was very helpful for me. It made me have a better understanding of the original play that Shakespeare wrote since it had the parallel text right next to it. I encourage students to buy this book because it extremely helps out! Good Luck!
1,"Stupid book only suitable for the old fashioned, elderly, or dweebs","I absolutly hated this book!!!!!!! I was forced to stop reading every five pages and throw it at a wall because it was sooooooo boring. Shakespear really brought out his worst in this awful book. The english translations rarely made sence, the font was teeny tiny (size 9, according to Microsoft Word when I scanned it onto word), and the pages were flimsy. All in all, an incredible waste of time and money!!!!!"
4,A great read,"So happy to see the story line continuing! The Agency matures, relationships mature and new characters appear. However, the author is starting to get a little wordy, going on a little too much with social commentary. It is not annoying though. The great story, characters and descriptions of the beautiful country do make me want to go visit there."
2,"If this is your first time reading the series -- it's wonderful. Otherwise, repetitive & tedious.","The No 1 Ladies Detective Agency series is charming. This is the sixth installment I've read. Unfortunately, 60% of the content of this edition has been covered in the first three books, which I found frustrating.If you have read other novels in the series, you may skip wholesale passages of this book -- literally turn over pages and just scan them. The plot is not advanced, and the book is cluttered by the repetition. I became frustrated with the lack of plot movement over entire chapters. What was sweet and tender in the first three books has become tepid and stagnant by the sixth.However -- if this is your first time reading the series, you may become entranced and probably will want to read the rest as fast as possible. Read the first three books next."
5,ladie's detective agency series,"These books are delightful in so many ways. Comedic, intrigue, everyday happenings in a different country but it goes to show you people are people.I wish the world would follow in the footsteps and ideals of the good people in these novels, etiquette and respect for others as the main characters practice as part of their normal lives, would make this world a better place!"
5,The best in the series...,"In Book 6 of the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency series, the author allows his characters to really come into their own. The addition of a new member to the crew at Tlokweng Speedy Motors/No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency is of great benefit to the narrative. The book starts off with a mystery and has a bit more of a ""Murder She Wrote"" type feel to it than the other books in the series. The return of a figure from Mma Ramotswe's past brings about a deeper sense of introspection from her character. Fans of Mma Makutsi will be happy to know that her storyline finally develops.This is definitely the best of the six novels and Smith seems to grow more and more as a writer with each novel in the series."
2,Boring audio entry in an otherwise wonderful series...,"I have loved all of the books in this series until this one. I like them so much that I have listened to most of the audio recordings in addition to reading the booksThe reader, in this case, as in all previous recordings, is fantastic. I also think the story line is still interesting here so reading the book may have proved enjoyable, however, there are a lot of seemingly pointless and/or obvious conversations/ruminations so that listening to it on tape was fairly tedious. In the other books, the ""ruminating"" was always interesting and often entertaining. My attention wandered often with this book and I couldn't wait for it to end - I finally gave up and finished the story by reading the book."
5,In The Company of Cheerful Ladies,"In The COMPANY Of CHEERFUL LADIES.This series of books are FUN!! They uplift your spirits as you read about the kindness and intelligence of the characters. Mma Ramotswe is a character that takes you through the logical thinking process, yet still has time to drink her bush tea and appreciate the beautiful environment of her beloved Bostwana. I read these books and feel better about EVERYTHING."
5,A great read.,"This group of books is one of the most delightful reads I have found in a long time. It is a gentle ""detective story"", but really a lovely story about some very nice people, and the very realistic trials they face, re: children, work ethics, and as down to earth as what shoes to buy for your wedding when money is limited. I love all the characters in this book and have read all of them. This book was bought as a gift."
5,one of the best of Mma. Ramotswe,"I loved this book (as I have loved all of the series) - but think it may be one of the best. It always astonishes me that the books are SO true to the voice of the ""traditional Botswana woman"". Hooray for Alexander McCall Smith!"
2,Not Good,"While I love this series and would recommend it to anyone who likes a good mystery, I have to say that the product, book itself was not in good condition. It smelled of cat urine, which made it really unpleasant to read. As far as shipping goes I had no issues and the transaction had no problems.This is a really good book series in that it does not need crude language or sexual content to keep you interested. Just fabulously written dialogue and such detailed depiction of life in Botswana. The writer makes you want move there, the HBO series doesn't really give the same vibe."
5,In The Company of Cheerful Ladies,"I have not read this book at all. I ordered a copy for my daughter, because I know she enjoyed The Ladies No. 1 Detective Agency. So far, every book I have read by Alexander McCall Smith has been just wonderful, highly imaginative and entertaining."
2,Cheerful Reading,All of Alexander McCall Smith's stories of Precious and her friends are superb. This just continues a wonderful line of stories about Botswana.
2,Disappointment,This book was not at all what I expected. It was boring and written for folks from a different culture I think. I gave up on it about 1/2 the way thru.
4,Still good,"Mccall does not fail to keep up the warm and gently sensitive narrative of his characters, who find joy in the simple beauties of life and try to make the best of its complexities."
3,No Better or Worse Still Good,"I enjoyed all the No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency books. They are all well written, balanced and consistent. The only problem is by the time you get to the fourth or fifth book written in the same style, the work feels repetitive. In some ways book three is the best because some tension and uncertainty is introduced and the characters deal with that in ways different from the previous books. Read this book, it's great. Just don't expect that it will be much different."
3,Krpelach Soup,"Lie in area where they do not sell Kreplach,so I tried the canned soup. The broth is very good but the kreplach are small chiien flave. We add some noodles so we are not just eating broth. I would reccomend the company make bigger size cans and put in larger beef filled Kreplach."
4,Good break from the gameboy.,"I got this for my 8 year old austistic son. he loves his role playing video games and I was hoping to get something with a little more educational value.The pluses are:volume control (for car rides and my son doesn't like loud noises in general)Seems challening for age 8Doesn;t repeat play too muchThe big miuns is there is no backlight screen, like a gameboy, so nighttime use or too much light it gets hard to see.I also bought the math quiz biz which my son likes better (but he likes math in general better)"
2,Good device but bad straps.,"The version of this item I received has metal snaps on the straps. We've had the item less than three weeks and already two of the snaps have ripped just from taking it on and off the toilet seat a few times. How does a snap rip in half? The metal literally tore. I really need this item for my Autistic son so I will probably just find a way to make it work using velcro or something. I have contacted the company today to try and get this resolved. For the money, the straps should be better made."
3,Not quite what I expected,This was a good read with a lot of interesting history on the Toyota Production System but its just that. The majority of the book is written about the evolution of TPS and what economic factors drove its creation. If your looking for a book on thought process that inspired Taiichi Ohno to develope the Toyota Production System then this is the book for you. But if you are looking for a book that gets into advanced TPS processes then I would not suggest it.
5,The Essential Book on TPS,I am a former Toyota Engineer and recommend that anyone interested in learning about the Toyota Production System a.k.a. lean manufacturing this is the place to start. Mr. Ohno is the creator of TPS and he gives a very good overview of how the system works. The book is very easy to read and easy to understand. This book should be read by all upper management employees looking to create a lean environment in their plants. The book will give you a good foundation to start implementing the techniques. It is the best book to read considering it comes from the inventor himself. It is the best you are going to find shy of being actually trained within Toyota's walls.
4,Interesting experience,"In this book Mr Taiichi Ohno shares his experience introducing several concepts to be more productive and it's what we called now Toyota Production System, this book is not a book to teach you how to calculate kanban qty or how a std work sheet should be, however gives you an idea of what problems they faced on that time to implement TPS."
5,Great book!!,"Great book!!. And even it was a used one, it seems better than new. I think I made a good purchase. Thanks!!"
4,Great!,"This book was good and I like the way Bonnie had Carole riding Starlight, or Petty Boy as he was called, to Pine Hollow because Veronica thought her horse, Garnet, was sick but Lisa, Stevie, Phil, and Phil's best friend, A.J. played a joke on her. This book was petty good. It's a book that you would love to read if you like romance, are horse-crazy, and would like to own a horse."
5,Great Book Every One Should Read It,I think this could be my Favourite Saddle Club Book but i like all the ones i have read..........
1,Look elsewhere,This was the perfect radio until the AM and shortwave quit working right after the warranty expired (one year). FM still works great but I could have just bought an FM radio for a lot less money instead.
1,Poor Performer,I have 2 other SW radios with a lower price than this one and the reception for each is much better. Disappointed.
4,An excellent radio!,"Please understand that this radio is NOT a DXer's radio. It lacks single side band (listening to hams and utility stations) and dual conversion circuitry (image rejection). However, it is a superb radio for listening to major broadcasters such as the BBC World Service or Radio Canada International. It is very small (about the size of a pack of cigarettes) and only requires two AA batteries. The signal/battery life indicator are handy features. It is also has very good weak signal sensitivity. If you are looking for a small, basic radio that DOES cover the full SW spectrum, then this radio is a good buy."
2,Forget it for shortwave,"Radio works fine for AM & FM but forget it if you want to use for shortwave listening. There is no squelch so frequency scanning is worthless. It just stops on every frequency. The manual tuning dial is small and somewhat 'sticky', you will only use it to fine tune. Shortwave reception isn't all that great. I can put it next to a tabletop radio with built in antenna and the tabletop pulls in 75% more stations. If you want a small AM/FM radio with alarm and are willing to pay $100, go for it. Just don't expect much from the shortwave perspective."
1,Buyer Beware,The picture on the amazon website is taken directly from the stickley website which is not the same rocker drawn out in the plans. They are similar but definitely not the same. The plans scale is kind of vague and doesn't measure perfectly 1/2 or 1/4 scale like it says. There are lots of missing dimensions including some crucial ones like the angle of the back. The instruction booklet is very minimal and isn't very helpful at all. I expect much better plans for $16.
4,A God-send for fish-obsessed toddlers,"This is one kid-friendly, blissful hour of beautiful fish in sparkling water ... just what my toddler desperately desires! I know my kid is not the only fish-obsessed child in America, so this is a perfect video for all of us who don't have the time, money or inclination for a tank of our own. The fish are exotic and colorful, the video quality is excellent, and the music is actually tolerable (sort of ""Nautical Muzak meets Windham Hill"" -- which beats ""Barney"" songs any day). Based on ear-to-ear smiles and repeated squeals of ""She-shes!"" (fishies), this is one of the best videos I've purchased for my kids."
4,"Not up to the Gerbil Cage Video, but...","... this is still a scintillating work which reveals new layers every time I watch it. It can be enjoyed merely as escapism, I admit, but if you dig for the more disturbing undercurrents, it's an even richer experience. The sense of color and composition on display here surpasses anything being done in the world of video today; certainly the overrated Sadie Benning can't even touch the simple eloquence of Fish Tank Video.I was a little disappointed by what I saw as the maudlin tendencies of some of the relationships, but this is a relatively minor complaint when a video is simply this gorgeous."
3,Despite Being Abridged This is a Good Audiobook!,"I listened to an audio book recording for Diana Palmer's Nelson's Brand and I thought it was good. I liked Diana Palmer's story, I liked the characters Gene and Alison and I liked the audio book and I think the narrator was good but I do wish this was an unabridged audio book instead of abridged but that's my only complaint and I recommend this book in either regular book form or audio book if you like audio books and don't mind this one being abridged. Even though it's abridged I would definitely think of keeping this audiobook!"
2,Disappointed,"I bought this to learn more about Open Office. In the end, I was disappointed with my purchase. I expected more information to assist me in understanding Open Office. I did not return it because maybe I just expected too much help."
1,Soothing breezes,"Well,now that I have everyone's attention.. I would rather have my eyes removed with a steak knife than have to listen to this new age crap. I'm from that barren rats nest Mt. Desert (pronounce it ""Mount Dessert"" you farmers). God. Why people have to romanticize that place and imbue with some ""mystical"" qualities is beyond me. All I know is that there are lot of us out here who you couldn't pay enough to move back to the magical shores of Mt. Desert. Most of us would rather live under a bridge in a refrigerator box."
2,Mrs Piggle wiggle book,The pages were reversed part way through the book. In order to read it it must be turned upside down and you have to go back. It was an old library book. Too expensive to send back or repair.
5,The Light of my Life,"For so long my living room was not sufficiently lit. I would struggle to read books, to spot misplaced items, to decide which button to press on my TV remote control; constantly changing the channel when I meant only to change the volume. When I found this lamp, elation swelled in my heart. I had no doubt over its quality as I had seen it in many movies before, but even I couldn't predict its excellence.The rays of light it exudes when I turn it on make my living room look alive, like it's being lit by the evening sun, streaking through light clouds. The details of my living room become so clear; the world becomes high definition even without the HD glasses I bought at Target.This lamp has changed my life, and I know that it will change yours."
5,MAURITIUS,"Finally a Mauritain group making it in dis industry, good stuff boys coz dis song is bumpin, wait for the up an coming Mauritian rap group ""Doja"" featuring MID-B and Mellow-D 2 blaze up coz u know ""Doja be 2 Mauritians with a vision 2 work the microphone with precision, sit back an listin coz it's a mission"". HEY MIIIIID-BEEEEEEE"
3,Authors comment,"Firstly, I'd like to thank the reviewers for their kind words about my book.Secondly, I'd like you to know that the much revised second edition was published in mid July 2003 and is currently (Sept 2003) available from all good booksellers. Dunno why Amazon are dragging their feet.......The second edition has about a third more text than the first edition, a new chapter on axes and another on missile weapons and lots of new illustrations and photographs. It has a new cover. The first edition has a green cover with a ship on it, the second is black with warriors.Lastly, I'd like to thank all those who bought the first edition!Regards,Kim Siddorn"
4,"Very Good, but not Excellent","The problem with getting 30 songs in one set of CD's is that not all of them are going to be great. That is the way it is with this set. There are a few great songs and a few forgettable ones. Overall, it's a set that will add some good salsa songs to your collection, just do not expect it to be the greatest salsa set of 2007."
4,Trimmer,I haven't used it much but it did everything I hoped for. The only thing I found wrong that the battery do not last the hour it was supposed.
5,Great trimmer,"This trimmer lives up to its claims. The battery lasts a full 40 minutes and it cuts through vegetation up to a half inch (will depend on hardness of the stem). I also liked the sheath that comes with the trimmer. The sheath can be screwed into a wall and the trimmer slides into it for convenient storage. The safety trigger takes a little getting used to, but is a great saftey feature. I would highly recommend."
4,Trimmer Review,"Plenty of power for ""average"" trim work. Held enough charge to finish the job. Weight could be an issue with extended periods of use. Overall, very pleased with it's performance."
4,B&D Cordless Trimmer,"Gets the job done for light trimming, but, I had hoped it would be a bit more powerful. A nice bonus is that the battery pack is interchangeable with my other Black & Decker cordless tools."
5,Glad I Got It,This is my second B&D cordless product and I am quite pleased. Cordless is so much easier and a whole lot faster. It did the job and actually a better than my old hedge trimmer that had a cord. Since we have red ozone days half of the summer I feel a lot better using something easier on the air quality too.
1,Be wary of reviews by people that just purchased this item!,"I have had this unit for almost a full year. I have used it about 12 times now. The first time was good; neat not having a cord. The second time alright. The third time the battery petered out after 15 minutes. As it is now, the battery doesn't hold a charge just sitting on the shelf even though you might have charged it fully before putting it away. I just went to use it one last time... it lasted all of 5 minutes. Who wants to sit around waiting for 3 hours for a battery to charge and then bam!, get right to work before it loses any power... and I have tried that too... it konks out after about 20 minutes on a ""full charge"" now and the last ten minutes of that is not very powerful. I'm am totally disgusted with product, and that is why I marched right into the house to write this review."
1,Great until the battery dies after a few uses,"I had the same experience as another reviewer with this trimmer. It worked great until the battery stopped accepting a charge after just a few uses. I have had this problem with other Black & Decker cordless products and vowed never to buy another from them (and have not had this issue with other cordless tool manufacturers). However, at the time this was the only cordless trimmer on the market with an 18V battery. I should have listened to myself. What a waste of money.*** Turns out it was not the battery that had the problem. It was the charger. It died after only a few uses! So, I unnecessarily bought a new battery. When that didn't charge, I got a Black & Decker rapid charger. Unexpected expense but now have two batteries and a rapid charger. Would have preferred if the original charger continued to work.*** Now after 3 months the latest battery doesn't hold its charge. Garbage."
4,Good product except the trigger arrangement!,"This product performs as advertized, has plenty power and met my expectations except the trgger safety release! You have to work the safety catch before you can pull the trigger to operate the trimmer. I found this very awkward and actually creats more of a safety hazard trying to fumble with the safety release switch if you are turning the unit on and off when moving from one shrub to another and the distraction takes away from working safely. After my first 10 minutes of use and getting aggravated with this unfriendly designed switch, I went into the housing and removed the safety slide/spring and it now works like a charm. I also wished a spare battery was included in the package to have a fresh charge ready to go!"
5,Excellent !!!!!!,"I had this clipper for a couple of years now and I am very satisfied with it. I have a pretty large hedge and it cuts the whole thing on one charge. I'm still using the same battery too! No need for a new battery, this one still works fine."
4,Works for me!,"I purchased this trimmer for some bushes around my house. I knew it wasn't going to be a particularly difficult job, since there's only a few, so I went with the cordless.Wow. It works quite a bit better than I expected. Now I'm actually using it to help clear out some growth that has been encroaching on my backyard for the last couple of years.This thing is great! Not sure what happened with the guy that's having all of the battery problems -- I actually stored the battery that came with this trimmer and I use the batteries that I have for the blower and edger. Those batteries have been in use by THOSE two machines for over a year now. Now I use them for all three, and the battery that came with the trimmer is in the cabinet waiting for the day that I need a replacement. :-)"
4,A near fit for the job,"It's light enough that I can wield it one-handed in tight quarters. With no cord I can lug it easily anywhere in the yard. It is adequately powerful for most of what I intended to cut with it though I noted it could not handle some small branches that my old manual scissor-style clippers could. Still, what it could cut was more quickly and easily done than I could have managed with those old clippers."
5,Black & Decker Codrless 18v Hedge Trimmer-a good purchase,"Thus far, it does what I expected. I have a number of the B&D 18v tools (blower, line-trimmer, riciprocal saw). By having several batteries and charges (one, sometimes two, coming with each purchase), it allows continued operation. The hedge-trimmer is long enough to be efficient and seems powerful enough for ordinary hedge trimming."
5,Great trimmer -,"The charge lasted thought the entire job; several bushes later and without recharging, we used it a couple of days later for additional trim.We were pleased with how easily we got the work done.Highly recommend for bushes and small branches. What used to take us for ever with manual hedgers, was a snap with this thing."
4,Black7Decker NHT518 18-Volt cordless hedge trimmer,My wife bought this item and love the ease to work with The only problem we hwve encountered is battery life could be longer.
4,Al,This is a very handy trimmer. It works well and it is very convinient because I can interchange the battery with other cordless Black and Decker tools.
4,Darn good hedge trimmer for the money,"This tool's biggest advantages are; battery operated, long blade and very sharp blade. It works well on battery power as the blade is very sharp. The only reason I didn't rate it a 5 star is because in trimming some thicker bushes with stems in the quarter inch thick range, it doesn't have the power to get through a lot of them at one time.All in all, I'm very pleased with this item. Now that I don't have to drag out the extension cord to trim my bushes, they tend to get trimmed more regularly."
4,Finally.... cordless with some real POWER!,"This trimmer is GREAT. It has all the cutting power of my (recently sold) electric trimmer. To stay away from having that power cord, I almost purchased a gas unit... but they were too heavy. This 18v trimmer is light-weight, almost as light as the electric. The only reason I did not give it a ""5"" is that you can't ""lock-on"" the power switch like you can on the electric models. You have to have your finger on the trigger at all times. Sometimes the ""lock"" lets you reach just a little further, but that is really not a big deal.Also.... I do recommend buying an extra battery. It sure is nice to have one on 'stand-by' for those extra long cutting days.Mark JDVenice, FL"
4,Great trimmer without gas or cord!,I had been concerned that this trimmer would not be strong enough or last long enough to make it a useful addition to our garden. Our medium sized lot (1 acre) has a number of bushes. I was able to do them all on the original overnight charge. The only reason I gave 4/5 stars is that I do not know how well the NiCad batteries will recharge and last into the future though I plan to discharge thoroughly with each cycle of use. The trimmer is comfortable in my hands and safe. Feels well made.B&D; have done a great job.
1,Battery Pack is Crap,"I purchased this on August 8th, 2008 and used it less than ten times and already it wont hold a charge. Buy a DeWalt instead. B & D quality has disappeared in China."
1,Does NOT work! Defective!,"We received this tool and the battery that CAME WITH IT did NOT fit in the unit! We have other tools that take the same battery and you do have to ""snap it in hard"" to get it to lock. In this case the very battery that came with the unit wasn't even the right size to begin with and did not fit. Also, the battery that came with it did not fit in the charger that came with it as well. VERY disappointed and returned it. We bought an identical model at our local Lowe's for $3.00 more and are VERY VERY happy with the performance of this tool! It has interchangeable batteries with our blower and that works very well also. HIghly recommend the edger, just buy it locally at a store!"
5,BHunt,As an older person (age 86) its light weight and strong battery has been a great advantage over my corded hedge clipper. Added advantage is the battery can also be used with my B & D chain saw.
5,fantastic; worth the money,"I have owned both a gas hedge trimmer and electric hedge trimmer over the last 18 years cutting my hedges. I have used the B&D Cordless Hedge Trimmer #NHT518 twice and this by far is the best. I have about 120 feet of hedges which translates in to about 900 square feet. I bought an extra battery but so far I have not needed it. It has the power to cut this hedges, is lightweight, no gas fumes, no chord. Love it."
3,Ok for small jobs,"I have about 4000 sq. feet of hedge. It took me five charges to cut it all. By the time I was done, the trimmer was really weak. It can't handle continuosly running. It seemed to overheat toward the end. I returned it because it was not suitable for my needs. It did fine on a few of the smaller hedges in my yard, I would recommend it if you only have a few small hedges to cut."
4,"Does its thing, charge the battery the night before","I bought this to get a $45 cordless trimmer and spare battery for my B-D pole chain saw. The batteries are interchangeable.The trimmer very light and easy to manage.Charge the batteries the night before you need them, and they seem to be fine. I may add the fast charger, but I seldom need to work long enough to go through more than two charged batteries, or I should have better things to do."
3,A nice blend of music for Christmas,"This is one of my favorite discs at Christmas time. It is at once peaceful and calm, yet joyous and expectant. There are the usual brass and organ carols, but also stunning arrangements and performances of lesser-known things. Prime among these are the setting of ""Away in a Manger"" that makes me want to pull off the highway and listen just to that song without distractions, and the pulsing, exciting ""What Strangers are These"", which I have never heard anywhere else. Chorally, the disc is a little unsatisfying because of balance issues with the rest of the disc--some songs are loud, others very soft, so it makes it hard to listen to without having to adjust the volume periodically. However, I still wouldn't trade it for all the Messiahs in the world!"
3,guitar no good on CD,"The seller was fine. An old recording I have on 7"" tape runs rings around this one (Old one has Bream on guitar)."
3,Tale of Two Cities,"I bought this resource guide for a 9th grade college prep high school class. I found it to be very useful in the carefully constructed lessons, suggested projects, unit tests and extra activities. I would have rated it 5 stars except for two problems. After printing out the 144 page guide, I was surprised to find that there were no page numbers. Keeping the pages in order or locating a page previously used was nearly impossible, so I had to go thorough the 144 pages myself and number them on the back. Also, the unit tests, and vocabulary tests do not give the chapters covered. I had to figure this out for every test. These are small points compared to the overall high quality, but like most teachers I am pressed for time and found these ommissions annoying. The CD ROM is MAC compatible which is not mentioned in the product description."
3,Casual Fan Book,"This is a nice collection of Esher work for the casual fan not looking to spend a lot of dead presidents. THe book also has biographical information,ect"
5,Great little drive,"I've been very happy with this drive. I really like the small size and the design. The drive stays securely attached to my key chain by the cap of the drive, which makes it really easy to detach from the chain to put in a computer. I like that much better than having a drive without a cap, so that my whole set of keys hang off the computer, because there's no easy way to detach the drive from the key chain. At first I was worried that the cap might loosen with use, but that has never been a problem."
4,A good one if you can find it.,"Sub par sound quality, in nearly every version I've ever heard (even the cuts compiled onto ""Early Seger"" sound terrible, as far as audio is concerned), but the album is a good one if you can find it. ""Back in '72,"" the tune, is a Seger highlight. ""Turn the Page"" is ok, but ""Midnight Rider"" is awesome. ""I've Been Working"" rocks out very hard, as well as ""Rosalie."" You won't be disappointed by this one."
3,Cool album!,"Due to a low sales record,this album was out-of-print for many years. Pre-Silver Bullet Band Bob Seger did an excellent job on two memorable tracks,Van Morrison's I'VE BEEN WORKING and Seger's self-penned TURN THE PAGE. Both tracks were recorded live for LIVE BULLET. The LB version of the latter track would be recycled for the 1994 GREATEST HITS compilation."
3,Intresting but not very precise information,"Complete Book of Dwarf Chiclids by Hans Joachim Richter is quite a big, beautiful book. Full of photos, schemes and drawings it is quite disapointing when you read it. The marjority of books on dwarf chiclids focus on south american dwarf chiclids. This book goes further and bring some african species too, but in both south american and african chiclids there is an seriuos problem : lack ok essencial information. The book describes few species of chiclids, it gives basic info, but as a hobbyist, I think I would expect more of this beautiful book. I know it is hard to keep an book up to date, specially with some genus like Apistogramma, in witch new species are being described every day. One final observation : The author is an exellent photographer, his book has marvellous photos....if he could update this book with more info, it would be just great!"
1,not what i thought,These muffins were not at all what I thought they would be. The hint of pumpkin was not even there. They were more like a carrot muffin with a bitter flavor. SUgar free does not have to taste like this.
2,Batteries won't last; save your money!,"The product actually works pretty well when it is new. Unfortunately, their estimated 3 hr. run time never lives up to their high hopes. You can expect a full 20 minutes of actual, effective run time. I have had mine for 2 years and 1 month; the second battery is now dead while the first one died a couple of months into it's use. Now, the batteries will cost roughly $40 each to replace. Double that to replace both batteries and you can almost purchase a new unit.I used mine roughly 1 1/2 seasons and primarily found it frustrating due to the battery draining too quickly. To my surprise, the spool of cutting string lasts quite a bit longer than I expected.If you have a small yard...perhaps in a townhouse, this may work for you. For the average suburb. owner, I say save your money and go with a small gas weedeater. I would NOT recommend buying this."
2,Batteries only last 10 minutes,Does anybody else think that 9 hours of charging for only 10 minutes of use is not a good deal? Even with two batteries 20 minutes of run time I can't get my lawn done. There has got to be something better that lasts longer.
2,"two batteries, still no staying power","Black & Decker NST2018 18-VOLT CORDLESS GRASS HOG TRIMMER.The auto string feed is great, now if they can get some ""staying power"" from the two batteries! Cannot trim front or back yard before both batteries need charging. The re-charging time for each battery makes the trimming operation a two day affair. Now have three batteries, but re-charge time is still a hold-up."
5,So far so good,"I did a lot of research on grass trimmers. I settled on this one b/c I didn't want a cord or gas power. The battery lasted fine for me while I did all around the edges of my house and my tree. My arms did get tired by the end. I think it was just a different angle than what I am used to b/c I carry around a child all day long who is 20 pounds. At any rate, plenty of power. Did just what I wanted it to do. Easy to put together. I did buy mine at Home Depot b/c I had a coupon so it was cheaper than amazon plus I got to hold it and see how to operate it before purchase. For the people who are getting whipped by the feed, I think you must have forgot to take the tape off of the cutter that is on the edge that prevents the feed from going past the guard. Try that so you don't weed whack yourself!!!"
3,battery drains too quickly,"Lightweight true but I had great expectations that this would solve my weed problems. The battery runs out of power within an hour. The recharge takes three hours. There are two batteries included with the grass trimmer but I need more time since it takes longer than I think it should to plow through my weeds. I rate this three stars because it does come with two batteries but wish I could rate it higher for performance. If you have a small yard to trim, you will love the freedom of going cordless."
4,Grass Hog,"This product is great it is very light, it is so nice not to have to deal with the normal vibration you get from gas trimmers.i dont ever bother the neighbors because it's so quiet, but it would be nice if the batteries would last a little longer."
1,VERY POOR Batteries,"Very poor batteries--they must be used immediately after charging, drain quickly, and take a long time to re-charge. Since it only comes with 1 charger and won't hold a charge, must start charging 12 hours before you intend to use it (6 hours for each battery). With today's battery technology, Black & Decker could have done much better"
1,I get tired too after only 15 min of trimming,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT unless you are able to trim/edge your lawn in less than 15 minutes. The product only lasts that long on one battery and charging a single battery takes 3 hours. You are better off buying an edger that also has the capability of using an electric cord. I'm horribly disappointed and my lawn is not fully edged.
1,Shaft broke,"I bought this product and after a few months the shaft broke in half. I am serious about this, I had to put it back together with some stuff and taped the outside of it. The trimmer looks horrible and the batteries don't hold a charge to complete my lawn which is the smallest lawn in the northern hemisphere. I would not buy this trimmer at all. Get a lighter one and you will do better. Plus, this review is by a real person not a paid reviewer like some of these reviews."
5,She is happy,I bought this for my wife after reading hundreds of reviews I thought this was the best one for the price. She didn't like the gas powered one I had and said she wanted a cordless one so I bought the Black and Decker 18 volt for her. She LOVES it!! I would recommend this to anyone. It is light and easy to adjust and to use. I ordered this through Amazon and I received it promptly.
4,"Good, not great","I've had this trimmer for a little less than a year. It holds a charge fairly well, and the two batteries are adequate to trim for about 30 minutes. It handles the edge of the lawn fairly well, but slows down in heavy grass and weeds. It also requires precise positioning in order to adequately and fully trim an area. It is fairly lightweight and easy to use, which is nice and it's fairly quiet too. Overall, it does a good job for light duty trimming along fences, the edge of the grass, around trees, etc. It is less effective on thicker brush, large weeds and thick grass."
4,Good trimmer,"We have been using this trimmer for about six weeks now and it has worked fine. The charge lasts long enough to deal with our roughly one half acre yard. I would not want to try and use it on heavy grass or bigger weeds as the line is kind of wimpy, but for use around the house trimming grass it has served our needs."
3,Trimmer,"Does a good job as a trimmer and edger. Light weight makes it easy to handle. Battery doesn't last as long as I would like, however, with the two batteries supplied I am able to finish my yard."
1,Awful!!,Worked for one season before the automatic stringer no longer works. Stick with either an electric or gas trimmer until B&D works out the kinks.
2,Great other than the battery life,"Pros:-Light-Quieter than plug in electric or gas trimmers-CordlessCons:-Not as powerful as plug in electric models-Batteries are worthless, even with 2 batteries it has now taken me 3 charges of 2 batteries each session to finish a small job.If they can solve the battery life, this would be a good product, but currently charging the battery is just as much of a hassle as hauling around an extension cord."
1,Not worth the hassle,I purchased this product and was very dissapointed in it. Batteries would not stay charged more than 20 min. after being charged for several days. Returned product and went to Sears and purchased a Craftman Cordless Trimmer hoping it will be better.
2,BATTERY IS A JOKE,"THE REVIEWS I READ ON THIS PRODUCT ON THE SEARS WEBSITE WERE GLOWING...SO I BOUGHT IT. AFTER REALIZING THAT THESE BATTERIES ARE A JOKE AT BEST I'M RETURNING IT. TODAY, ON THE 5TH FULL CHARGE, I GOT 5 MINUTES OUT OF IT. I DECIDED TO CHECK AMAZON'S REVIEWS AND LOW AND BEHOLD THERE ARE THE ACCURATE REVIEWS...THE THING IS A DUD ! YES IT CUTS PRETTY GOOD FOR 2 MINUTES THEN KAPUT ! I CAN'T BELIEVE BLACK AND DECKER WOULD MARKET SOMETHING SO FAULTY."
3,It's ok.,"I'm not all that pleased. The description is vague when it states that you can do 1/2 acre of home property with both batteries. Instead of saying that it will last 15 minutes per charge, it sounds like it would do a full yard. It doesn't. Other than that it is a pretty good thing. I like the fact that you don't have to keep bumping it for more string or having to re-wind. That was my pet-peev with all the others. This one you just push the button and off you go. Maybe it seems so fast because I don't have to stop to re-wind the string. Hee-hee."
3,Black & Decker ?,It's bautiful machine but I had trouble fitting guard for this trimmer! Screw holes did not lined with maine body. I had to hire some machanic to fit.
3,Good for procrastinators,"My favorite thing about this trimmer is that it often gets me out of work. Either I forget to charge the batteries up the night before and I get out of a whole days work, or I only have to work for an hour or so since the batteries don't last that long.Overall it's a nice trimmer for light duty, but I'm not sold on the battery aspect. I'll probably be getting a gas or corded trimmer to replace this one."
2,Under-Powered & Short Runtime,"This is a under-powered trimmer and edger. I have regular size lawns around my house in 7,500 sq-ft lot. Both batteries run out well before completing even the front of the house. It is extremely disappointing and annoying that I have to trim and edge over two days after mowing the whole yard in one day. Not only does it run short, it is also under-powered. Edging a 15-foot-long walkway consumes one battery charge without completely cutting some edges."
2,Not Enough Battery Life,"I have a decent size yard in a subdivsion, but it's only about 1/2 an acre total (that's including the large chunk taken up by the house and the deck). So when I got this electric trimmer I thought, ""No problem, I should have enough power to do at least the whole backyard or front yard"". I was sadly disappointed to find out that even with two 18 volt battery packs I couldn't even get the smaller front yard completely done like I'd like to. I get about 10 to 15 mins of power out of each battery. I am also not thrilled with the self feeding line either. To me it stays way too short; I have to practically hold the trimmer so it's touching the ground. All and all I wish I hadn't bought this product and will be replacing it with either an electric one I can plug in or go back to gas powered."
1,Another throw away tool after 2 seasons,"Just be aware that while this can do basic trimming, it will need to be repaired or replaced very quickly. The plastic is as cheap as it can get for a unit that needs to hold any weight at all. The battery is heavy, and if you dropped it from so much as four feet, I'm sure it would break. That being said, I took great care of mine. Today I plugged in the battery to find that the charger is broken. I went and bought a new charger and low and behold, the battery is dead. Cheap, cheap, cheap"
2,Learn from my experience,"This works well to begin with. Then after a few years, the plastic dries out on the shaft between the handle and the battery. Should it fall over at this point even on the lawn, it will crack and break in 2 with the wires inside being the only thing holding it together. It is virtually useless. I have owned 2 of them, one at a cottage and the other in town. Both of them broke in the same manner after 5 years. Too frustrating."
3,Dave A,"I guess for 99 bucks you can't expect too much.The trimmer does a good job of trimming, and batteries aren't too bad. The plastic guard leaves a lot to be desired. It comes in 2 pieces you have to assemble and install on the machine. When using it for the first time the guard flew apart and stipped the screw holes. I used Gorilla glue to put it back together. Hope it holds!Good job BD?!"
1,Total Frustration,I decided to go cordless and this model was on sale. Two batteries: what's not to like? Well I have a small yard with not much trimming to do and even with the two batteries fully charged I can not get anywhere near done. It's hard to believe a company could sell a defective product like this with a straight face. Did they think we would just not notice that we get ten minutes on the battery if we are lucky???
3,Good product,"I do like this trimmer. It is light, easy to manuever, and convenient. The plastic construction doesn't bother me as much as some of the other raters as it contributed to its light weight. Although it feels cheap the plastic hasn't broken yet after a year of use.The balance is good and I love not having a cord or to fuss with gas.However there are 3 issues that I think prevent it from being a very good product.- The string often breaks off or falls back into the unit while I'm using it. It is a hassle to repeatedly have to stop and rethread the line.- The battery power isn't enough to go around my small yard. Granted I have lots of weeds to whack, but using both batteries, I expect a longer running time.- The price is a bit high for these issues.I'm looking forward to the next improved generation."
1,"exploded, so sent it back","After a short time of usage of this underpowered device, the string spool and its covering exploded off and parts were lost making it impossible to reassemble. I sent it back for a full refund. I bought an earlier model of a Black & Decker cordless rechargeable trimmer in 2000 that was better powered and better built. Its rechargeable battery finally would not accept a charge anymore and was an integral part of the device so wasn't replaceable, leading to the current unfortunate purchase."
5,No more gas trimmers for me!,"I love this product. Pull the trigger and it works. No more pulling my guts out trying to start my gas trimmer. I have a half acre yard, and I can trim all of it with one battery--granted, the battery is beginning to run down but I make it. I would buy this trimmer agian.Greg"
4,works well but battery wears out fast,"This battery powered edger works almost as well as plug-in models. The battery charge doesn't last too long, but it comes with a second battery, and if you keep both charged, you can finish almost all jobs. Very convenient for places far from electrical outlets."
2,Only for the smallest of yards,"If you're only looking after a few dozen square feet at your condo, get it. It'll be fine. If you have anything bigger, don't. While you get two batteries, it's not enough juice to get around the whole yard and I end up finishing the next day after the batteries are recharged. Additionally, the most sure-fire way of shutting the thing off is by hitting it with the butt of my hand. The power switch locks on (don't know why) and is a pain to unlock and shut the thing off, so I smack it. I've had mine ~4 years."
1,more like a non-trimmer,from buying this item new I never got more than 10-minutes of trimming with either battery. 10-minutes of trimming then 9-hours of charging. any other trimmer would be better than this one.
4,Great weedeater for an older person,"At 63, I had to change from a gas powered (refused to wear strap) weedeater to something smaller but without any loss of performance. This weedeater seems to do the trick. Lightweight and strong. Only problem is I have 1/2 acre that I weed eat throughout and go through at least 2-3 batteries each week. Have numerous B&D; battery devices which resulted in two charger stations and 6 batteries. However, always seems the batteries die when I'm farthest from the house!One thing I would like to note is that with my gas powered 2 string Craftsman eater I was constantly stopping to change string. Doesn't do that with this one. Don't know if that has to do with the power of the device or not. Anyway, I'm glad."
4,Great Cordless Trimmer,"I purchased this based on the good reviews it received from other users. The main complaints I read were the about the amount of time each battery gives. I must say, I got more time per battery than I thought I would. I have about 1 acre that I trim various types of areas and two batteries allowed me to complete the whole job. Even with only one string it cuts well. The auto feed head worked great when trimming, but feeds a little too slow for edging. It works OK for edging, but GREAT for weedeating. I LOVE the weight of it, 1/2 of most ""lightweight"" gas versions. After three weeks and 3 gas trimmers that did not work or that I could not start, I was very pleased with this trimmer. I recommed it for anyone that HATES pull starting a gas powered one. Only reason for 4 stars is the edging limitation."
4,Plenty good for a small or medium yard,"I read a whole bunch of reviews before I bought this-not only this product but a lot of other cordless and corded electric trimmers. In retrospect, I would say that many of the reviewers of this type of product are people who want to do work that is heavier-duty than what I wanted. All I wanted was something to trim around a lawn and keep things tidy, not cut down really tall grass or big weeds. For a well-kept yard, medium or small in size (all I do it trim along a 100 foot driveway and around a few shrubs and trees), this product is just fine. I don't even exhaust one of the two batteries doing my yard. If, on the other hand, you are going after grass that is a foot tall, or if you are trying to cut down woody stemmed weeds, you will not be happy with this trimmer. I would definitely say this machine was worth the money and does what B&D says it will do."
4,Powerhouse cordless trimmer,Excellent product with tons of power to cut through the toughest brush. Battery life starts to run down after about 20 minutes but since two are included you just have to make sure their charged. As good as a gas without the problems starting.
1,Flimsy construction,While assembling the unit the screws from the guard skirt would not hold because the plastic of the main body was too flimsy. Without a guard skirt I had no choice but to return the unit unused.Amazon was very cooperative about handling the return. Kudos to them.
5,Black & Decker cordless trimmer is fantastic!,"I was so happy to find a cordless trimmer, and especially one with this brand and price! This trimmer is easy to assemble, lightweight, powerful, and the battery charge lasts and lasts. I could not be more pleased. It's quiet, easy for a woman to handle, yet strong enough to edge and trim everywhere I need it to. I love the autofeed on the line as bumping the old trimmer was always a pain. Definate recommended buy on this. My male neighbors are very envious of this great tool."
2,long charge time short work time,"I bought this thing to help me get a handle on the weeds growing in the ditch in front of my house and the terraced flower beds. I have given up now and hired someone to do the work.It takes about 8 hours to charge each battery and they only work for about 30 mins each. So for every 16 hours of charge time you get about an hours work. It is light weight and when the battery is charged works good, if you have a very small yard it may work for you."
4,I like the Grass Hog,"I have had this product for a month now. It pretty muchs works as advertised. I can easily edge/trim both front and back yard with battery power to spare. It is also light weight which helps.But as other reviewers have noted, this trimmer is not well suited for heavy, thick weeds. If this is your need, get a gas powered trimmer. But for normal, light yard duty this is the ticket. I recommend this product."
1,"Noisy, terrible battery, am returning it","I had bought the little Earthwise (I believe the name is) trimmer, which feels like a toy and is not at all powerful.I thought I'd try a B&D; and see if it is any improvement.The B&D; has a bit more power, and is substantially heavier. Yet it is incredibly poorly built. No pieces fit together easily. And the battery charger is a joke-- you charge and charge and charge. I was waiting for the red light to turn green, but get this, it does NOT turn green. You just have to guess!Instructions are useless. Kind of a bad diagram and that's it.There are two batteries, which is something, but you will only get 13 minutes out of each one.SO... while it has a bit more power than the Earthwise product, and two batteries, I will stick with the Earthwise unless I find something better. At least the Earthwise usually gets me 15 minutes of cutting and weighs less. Oh, did I mention the B&D; is incredibly noisy? It sure is.Back to the store with it..."
3,It is adequate,"The best, the very best word to describe it is 'adequate'. If you are expecting a tool that will cause you to work up a sweat while slaving for you, you will be disappointed. If you are looking for a tool that will last up to 10 minutes on domesticated grass that is at the most 6"" high and about as thick as the hairs on Jessie Ventura's head, this will do the job. The good news is that B&D was kind enough to include 2 batteries. Tbey also included instructions telling you to give the battery 5 charging cycles before the battery will achieve the life for which it was designed. On the plus side, your 95# kid or wife can use it without having to go to the doctor should the 'dumb' tool 'whip' them. I own it, and it owns me! TOM"
4,Good for light duty/ homeowner use,"This unit works as good as my corded trimmer, but having the auto feed is great, since every bump-n-go trimmer I've ever had ended up becoming a bump-n-jam-stop-and-unjam-then-go trimmer. I have a typical suburban yard and I can do all my trimming on the two batteries that comes with the unit. It's lightweight and there is no fussing round with cords or mixed gas -just grab it and go."
5,great trimmer,"I`ve used gas trimmers & this is by far the best (if you don`t have a big place. i`m 67 & the old gas one was getting heavy this is great. gilbert miller, mich."
4,Lighter and Faster,"I had the older version of this product for years and it was losing it's charge so I decided to upgrade. Now the older one claimed to self feed but never really did and I just assumed that they all failed in this caetegory. Anyhow, the new version is lighter and so far seems to self feed. I really like the two batteries option and one battery, at this point, will hold a charge charge that will last for the work I need done both front and back, I have normal size lot,for California, but for someone with a larger size lot, like they have in the midwest, the second battery will be just the thing. Don't normally buy stuff like this online but the price made the wait, which wasn't long, worth it."
2,Works fine for a year,"I bought the set with string trimmer. hedge trimmer,and blower. Everything was easy to use, and had decent power. Using up the two backup batteries, I could get through close to an hour of work. That was when they were new. Now, less than two years later, the batteries won't reach full charge, and peter out within minutes. The set is now worthless, and destined for the dump."
3,Should have gotten a longer trimmer,"Works very good for continuous trimming. Wish had gotten a longer trimmer, as the reach of a 12"" trimmer is only 4"". Actually shorter, due to the curve in the string, which actually reduces the reach to about 3"".But, as long as I know its limitations, we get along OK."
2,Would love this produce but,"The battery is so poor it makes the produce almost useless. As green as I am, I have considered buying a gas or corded weed eater... How sad is that?"
2,Dissappointed,"I found the secondary handle doesn't stay in position very well and I have it tightened as much as possible. If this handle isn't firmly in place it is impossible to rotate the trimmer head to do sidewalk edging. Maybe this is a quality control issue as most other people don't seem to have this problem, but I really regret buying this trimmer."
3,Battery life,"The trimmer works very well without having to use a bulky cord or the proper mixture of gas and oil...however the battery does not last very long. You do get two batteries, but when you charge them and dont use them the battery level drops and should be charged the day use."
2,Batteries are worthless,"I got this to replace a corded Black & Decker trimmer whose bump-feed had stopped working, and to get away from having to drag out a couple of extension cords just to trim along my sidewalk. This unit does a pretty good job of trimming, I'll admit, but the batteries are absolutely worthless. Know doubt it comes with two because each one individually isn't going to last very long. I don't have a big yard, but it takes both batteries, fully charged, to trim half of it. I get about 10 minutes of use from each battery before it slows to the point the trimming line no longer cuts itself off.I've had this trimmer almost a year and a half. If I had it to do over again, I think I'd probably get a small gas trimmer."
3,"12"" 18 volt String Trimmer",The trimmer works the best I ever had. Lightweight and very comfortable to use. However the battery is short lived. I thought it could go longer. In fact even with two batteries I end up out of power. That is the main down fall of this unit.
4,Great for small yards,We love our grasshogs; in fact we have two! They are great for trimming our small yards. The grasshog is lightweight and well balanced. The edging function works well and gives the yards a nice finished look. The only complaint is the battery life which generally just barely makes it through a thorough trimming and edging.
4,Good Product,Good Product. It gets the job done and having two batteries that charge within 9 hours each is good. I hope it lasts another season.
4,Works great.,"It's a good thing it comes with 2 batteries, as they do not last long, about 10-15 minutes, but I was pleased with the power it has. Perfect for the normal sized yard."
4,it does the job!,This works great to whack the grass and weeds growing between my vegetable garden rows. no more pulling weeds. It works well and manages even the tall weeds.
3,Quick to surrender,"Product is lightweight and easy to maneuver. However, battery is quick to surrender power. 10 to 15 minutes, tops."
3,Had to get it fixed first,"I bought this trimmer refurbished, and it did not work properly right out of the box - the string was feeding too quickly and would not cut to the proper length. The problem appears to be fixed, but we had to take it to the B&D service center, a real pain. Now that it is fixed, it does what it is supposed to do - trim my grass. Even I can use it and I am 8 months pregnant. So no complaints about the product, but be prepared if buying a refurbished model."
3,not as advertised,"6-9 hours to charge the battery, 6-9 minutes to use it up should be included in the features copy. If you don't compare it to a gas model you will be less disappointed in performance of this 18volt."
4,"Great weed whacker, but batteries DO NOT last as long as it says...","I bought this primarily for our rather smallish patch of front lawn - and it does do a terrific job, and it exceeds my expectations of cutting through absolutely everything easily and quickly, BUT -- it comes with two rechargeable batteries and you're told they are supposed to work for approximately an hour at a time. They work really well for about twenty minutes and then they start to put forth less of a serious charge. You can tell when you're using the weeder. It just doesn't work nearly as intensely after that period of time. It starts to feel ""tired.""I keep both batteries fully charged to do our front lawn and the trimming and use almost both batteries to do it.I am very pleased with the machine, BUT the batteries should really hold a fuller charge for longer than they do."
2,Assenbly required,"There is no mention of having to partialy assemble this item. The three scews that hold on the guard were very tight and took a lot of effort to put in correctly. The top handle was a mystery on how to put it on because there were no directions in the strange little owners manual that came with the item.After I finally got it assembled and tried to use it the line wouldn't feed, great. It doesn't put you in a good mood when the first thing you have to do is unreel a spool and hope you can get it running. So far no luck."
4,No more 2cyc engines!!!,"Just what I needed! Works great for all my needs. I can do my whole yard trimming on one battery charge. No more having to try to start those damn 2cycle gas trimmers again (20 or more pulls!)! Two other BIG pluses: No more smell, no more noise.... gone GREEN! The only (slight) drawback is the lack of power in real thick grass or weeds, but I just take a little more time and it gets through it. Also, I just don't let it get long or thick anymore!I bought the whole family of B&D; 18-volt yard products (blower, pole chain saw, hedgehog and this) and love all of them! And with 5 batteries and 3 chargers now I'll never be out of power!GO GREEN, BABY!!!"
2,Not as represented,"It was represented as having 9 hours of power. I don't know if they were counting 1 or both batteries. Either way, it ran about 1 hour per battery."
4,Battery life is short,"It works great but the battery life is way too short even when charged overnight, both batteries die before I can finish the edges of my front OR back yard and my property is only 1/4 acre."
1,Dangerous,"Horribly dangerous. Line cutter didn't work. Line would get too long and then snap and fly back and hit you. I had bruises and blood dripping from my shins, thigh and chest. Sent this back right away."
1,BAD SERVICE,"The 2 batteries have been charging for 4 days, they or the charger simply don't work.I called Black & Decker, they wanted me to drive an house to a service center.I'd avoid companies who call this service. Returning it."
2,Good For Very Small Lawns only,I live on a small corner lot and I had to charge both batteries 4 times to edge the entire property. It cuts really well and what it does it does good. However I found the batteries lasted 10 minutes before suddenly dropping and not cutting anymore.
2,Terrible battery life,"I want to like this trimmer. The automatic feed is great. Easy to control and get where I want it. Light, easy to use. Everything else is good but.....the batteries last me less than 10 minutes each! I have two. Takes many hours to recharge them and then about 15 - 18 minutes of use. I can never complete the task at hand and I do not have a big yard. I would rave about this otherwise but what good is it if it can't finish the job (or even come close)?"
4,Great tool for easy trimming.,"Bought this for the new house to tend to the yard. Easy to assemble, easy to use. Plug the battery in and you're ready to go. Head is adjustable to two settings for horizontal or verticle trimming. Nice feature since you're not turning the whole unit to an akward angle and risking injury. Having 2 batteries is a must. My first use, the first battery was shot after about 10 minutes of use. The batteries are NiCad so not as much power form LiIon but still do the job when they're properly charged. (Takes about 9-10 hrs to initially charge the batteries) I haven't had to change the cord yet. I imagine it won't be difficult. At any rate, this is a nice and in-expensive way to trim the yard w/o a gas powered trimmer. Especially as gas prices are hitting $4/gal in the US."
1,safest trimmer ever,"This is the safest trimmer I have ever owned. I could operate it in my bare feet. I had nothing to fear. Nobody has anything to fear from this trimmer. Not even the grass. In fact, my grass cracked up laughing when I got out this trimmer to use it. It doesn't work. And the batteries don't last."
2,No more B-&-D - money wasted,"I purchased this barely 6 weeks ago and the shaft broke yesterday. This is my THIRD Black & Decker trimmer purchase in the last two years. The first Grass Hog (like this one) worked well for the first summer but became a battery hog in the second summer and finally quit completely in May. Last summer, to extend the life of the first trimmer, I purchased the dual-string electric B & D trimmer. The motor froze up in the second month of use. I ignored these warning signs and bought this last one just over a month ago. Yesterday the center shaft broke. No more Black and Decker in this household. Now I have six batteries and chargers but no tool to use them in."
2,Trimmer OK but batteries are duds,"I've owned this trimmer for a bit over a year. At first it would trim well for about 20 minutes per battery -- not stellar, but acceptable. Now one battery lasts about 5 minutes and the other 10. At $35+ each for replacements, I find this unconscionable. Buying two new batteries will set me back about the price of the trimmer to begin with. And Black and Decker does not honour the warranty on batteries -- just the trimmer itself."
3,"Great for 4 Years, then worthless","Neither battery lasts more than four years and I used my trimmer very average amount for a suburbia house. Replacement batteries are $40/ each...no thanks. Love cordless, now buying lithium batteries powered trimmer. B&D seems to have better reviews than Ryobi."
2,"Great concept, but poor design.","Batteries are not charged from factory. after charging for about 9 hours, took it out to trim some grass. my whole experience only lasts about 5 minutes.First off, the blade that cuts the line broke after 5 minutes of use. But what made it break off in the first place was when the line hits a thick patch of grass, it will auto bump, causing the line to feed more. because of this, the line was able to knock the cutter out of place. end of experience.Great concept, but poor design."
3,Grass Hog,"Unit works great, but the battery life is short , The orginal 12 volt grass hogwas much stronger better , & the battery would last twice as long . 18 volt smallbattery does not have the storage capacity the 12 volt did ."
2,Buyer Beware!!,"There are good and bad features about this product so Buyer Beware! First the good features; it is lightweight, adjustable length (so it's easy on your back), and very powerful when fully charged. Now the BAD NEWS; the batterys only last 10 minutes. They must have known there would be a problem and that's why they give you two. But the charger takes hours to get them fully charged and you can charge only one at a time. Unless you can do all your trimming in under 15-20 minutes you will be unhappy with this product. I bought an extra batter and a dual battery charger but this was almost as expensive ($75.00) as the trimmer ($99.00)and that has issues also. Recommended for only the smallest of yards. Shame on you Black & Decker!"
4,Very convenient!,"This string trimmer is very convenient to use! I took care of my whole yard with one battery. Not heavy, no gas to mix (or buy) and no cords to carry! The only downside is the string doesn't do a great job of edging."
2,The old model was better,"My old 12V grass hog was starting to have a trigger switch problem, it served us well for about 6 years without a hic-up. So I purchased the new 18V one thinking it could only get better. NOT!! My old 12V grass hog still out performs the new one. Don't ask me how but my old one has more power and last longer. It is a little heavier but it does my whole yard on one charge. The new 18V grass hog almost makes it to the end but fizzles out.I can't believe they toke a ""Good"" product and make it ""Just ok""."
4,Not Happy,"I like all three Black and Decker 18v tools but not the company.I own a; grass hog, chain saw and hedge cutter. I like all three. i wish the grass hog had a little more power but I like its portability; it's a trade off. However two batteries have developed cracks in their casing. I called their customer no-service. I told the rep this was a hazard they turned me over to the supervisor who didn't care a bit. I was told to travel over 60 miles to a service center ""so they could look at it"". I gave them the serial numbers, approx date of purchase no help. Two items were bought on Amazon."
5,best purchase in a long time,"It works just great! Lightweight, powerful, and easy to use. I've had a Mac 2816 gas trimmer for the past 12 or 13 years, and this just blows that away. I ran it for 30-40 minutes, nonstop on a single battery, and it was still going strong when I put it away. And, no problems with linefeed or bogging down in thick grass. Excellent!"
4,Trimmer performance,"The trimmer seems to be well made and performs fairly well. Low noise level. Batteries do not last through half of the yard so time to allow recharge must be considered. The weight is easily handled, but the balance could be better. Positioning the trimmer for various cutting needs is difficult while holding the fail-safe button in the on position. The cutting line is supposed to auto feed, but is only so-so in that aspect. Overall rating would be six out of ten."
3,Mixed review,Light and easy to use but batteries cut out too fast to finish the whole yard...I'm no expert so maybe this is as good as it gets
2,Conceptually good but batteries are a hassle,"I bought this trimmer for my father due to the same reason most people purchase an electric trimmer - to mitigate gas fumes, and the annoying pull cord. Unfortunately, even with the two batteries, we can't even seem to trim our entire yard. Plus we don't get the power that gas (or even corded trimmers) offer. So although it seemed like a good idea, we ended up returning it to purchase a 2-cycle RYOBI gas trimmer instead. Pretty happy with it so far since it lasts much longer than the 30 minutes the batteries offered."
2,"works great at first, but beware!","This trimmer works fine out of the box. Batteries last a while 15-20 minutes (even though you only have one charger). However, after a couple of months, the battery life kept dwindling and dwindling to about 5-6 minutes, and I had to buy an extra battery and charger, but the same results. I tried different chargers, even different outlets, but I have to use all three batteries to get halfway around my yard.Forget this, I'm going back to corded! And keep this trimmer just for the remote out of the way places the cord wont reach!"
1,Save your receipt if you buy this trimmer,"Save your receipt if you buy this trimmer. The cap will break from the string whipping against it--before the first year is over. A replacement cap (with shipping) is $17, which is a waste of money because it's just going to break again. Then you have to add to the earth's landfill, a product that breaks before what should be a normal product life-cycle."
5,Great product!,This product works very well. Very light weight. I can't get used to not having that pesky electric cord following me around. I can trim my yard in half the time.
5,Could have used one of these years ago,Love it! It makes weed-wacking an easy job. It's light weight and powerful.Can do my yard on one battery charge.
1,LINE FEED SYSTEM IS JUNK,"BUYER BEWARE: These B&D battery-powered string trimmers use the same line-feed system as my 120v GH-1000 model, and that makes them JUNK. I was able to convert the head to an Echo Rapid-Loader, and that works quite well, but it's a custom jury-rig and it took me some time. Shop for another product. YOU WILL HATE THE LINE FEED SYSTEM ON THESE TRIMMERS . You can read my review for the GH-1000 model here on Amazon. This piece of equipment has cost me a LOT of time."
3,Good while works but not good battery life,"We live on a .4 acre lawn with fence around back yard. Using both batteries fully charged, we only get through about 3/4 of everything. We have a lot of trees and flower beds, so we ask a lot from this trimmer. I was just hoping 2 batteries would do the trick, but in reality, we really need a third."
3,battery weed eater,Very easy to use. and change of batteries very easy. I like the thought of not having to change clothes because of grass on pants legs. Thought battery wo0uld last a little longer. Light weight .
1,inferior product,"I bought this trimmer a year ago. As previously mentioned, the batteries don't last very long. It seems that they hold less of a charge every time they are recharged. I can live with that since I don't use it every time I mow, and I don't mind having to trim two days in a row. What really bothers me though, is the fact that after using it less than a dozen times, the charger no longer works. I call something that only works for that short a time period a piece of junk. This is the second Black and Decker item that failed after a few uses. I guess I won't be buying B&D products anymore."
1,DO NOT GET THIS PRODUCT,Purchased this product about a month ago and the batteries do not hold a charge. Do not waist your money....get something else.
3,Cordless is great!,This product arrrived on time- but right before another cold snap in the weather- so as of yet have not used it in the yard. I did put the few pieces on and charged the batteries up. Very impressed with it.
1,Don't waste your money,I am rather disappointed about this product. If you are going to use this trimmer for final touch up of your yard then this is okay. Don't expect to use this trimmer for any major clean-up or serious works.
1,not worth the money,This product does not work for more than 10 minutes when fully charged. It is very light and easy to use if you have a tiny yard.
4,Should Have Come with 3 Batteries,"Great product. Does the job. Unfortunately, the batter life is not perfect. They do give you two batteries. I use one for the front yard and one for the back yard. Sometimes the battery runs out when I am working on my average size front yard. Black & Decker should either improve the battery life or include 3 batteries."
3,trimmer,Unit is packaged nicely. Battery life is less then 10 minutes and takes more then four hours to charge. Poor battery life. Not what I expected for price from Black and Decker.
3,"good product, needs improvements","I had the same product althought my old one was electric, it got old, so i need it a new one. I decided to get it with out the cable, which it works just fine. It needs(both or all trimmers)to be a little longer, it is adjustable, but I'm 6"" tall, so I have to bend my back some for most of the time. and also the guide on the cordless doesn't seem to work as accurate as my old one. My yard it isn't that big, and I still need to use both batteries to get everything done. Power is good enough to get the job done but mobility is great, problably the best feature!!!"
4,Getting the most from the 18Volt batteries,"The first season I used this trimmer it worked great, not as powerful as a corded trimmer, but not needing to fool with the cord was a time and chore saver.The next season, the batteries were losing their power and had to be charged a number of times to complete trimming my medium sized yard.The third season, the batteries were almost useless. They would not hold a charge and had very little power.I solved this problem by draining the batteries completly and then charging them.I put a battery in place in the unit, pushed and taped the on/off switch to on, and let the motor run until the battery was completly drained.After a fast charge (about 2 hours) the batter worked almost as good as new.I now make it a habit to drain the power completly from the batteries after about every other use then fully charge them.Freckles"
5,Happy Trimmer w / Grass Hog,"OK.Listen to this :A friend showed me his GrassHog. Said he liked it very much. ( He's a Marine . )I went to Lowes, looked it over, bought one, plus an extra battery, as my friend said his batteries only lasted about twenty minutes. I've trimmed four cottages at the beach with one battery, and it's still eager to go on trimming. I'm using it and lovin' it. It replaces a gas powered, noisy trimmer, a lug the long cord around trimmer, and a trimmer that lasted about 15 minutes before dying and needing overnight charge. I'm hard to please, and this GrassHog does it for me ! ! I've returned the extra third battery I bought. Simply won't need it. Perhaps Black / Decker is improving their batteries. Very agressive cutting, also. Try it."
2,Shorter battery life than advertised,The first time I used this trimmer I thought I had found the solution to all the problems inherent in using a gas-powered unit. The second time I used it I got less than 30 minutes total trimming from both fully charged batteries. I'm not sure if the problem is with the batteries or the charger or both. B&D should at the very least include a dual battery charger with a quicker return. I exercised my 30-day satifaction guarantee and returned this trimmer.
2,Nice Trimmer/Terrible Power,"I love that this trimmer can also edge your lawn, and I love that it's not gas or corded, however that is also it's number one fault. The batteries take a very long time to charge and the charge does not last long at all. I wouldn't say that I have a large yard by any means. I was able to trim the grass along aprox. 25 feet of curbing when the battery started to die. It really is not worth the money for me."
2,Not good for edging + battery issues,"Good: Light weight, ergonomic (if trimming horizontally).Very poor: despite offering an edging option, its a pain to edge. The unity is difficult to hold for edging and the switch is difficult to press (you need it pressed for continued operation).poor: I have two batteries. The charging on both is inconsistent. Even after I leave them in the charger for 24+ hours, the level of charging varies significantly.I would NOT recommend this."
4,This is a great weed-whacker!,"Growing up, we had an electric trimmer that I dreaded using. It was bulky, it was weak, it required long power cords.This Black & Decker solves all of these problems. It is strong, it is cordless, it is easy to adjust the trimmer string length.I can do most of my yard on one battery, and everything I can think of with two.My only complaint is that there is no indicator of how full the battery is. Your best bet is to just charge it overnight.another thing I like is that it is not too noisy. Great job Black & Decker!"
2,Poor battery life,The strimmer works well and is light. It will handle the basic jobs and even tackle minor tough jobs and small areas of heavy weeds. It's real dissadvantage however is that each battery does not last long at all. Max 15 minutes each. So no more than 30 mins before you are done for the day. So overall disappointed and considering returning. Ok for small garden needs.Black & Decker NST2018 Grass Hog 12-Inch 18-Volt Cordless Electric String Trimmer with 2 Batteries
4,B & D 18-volt Cordless 12-Inch Grasshog String Trimmer,"I have used it to trim my large yard about 3 times. The two batterys last just long enough for me to finish all my trimming after mowing. I didn't want to drag a cord around and a gas one was more then what I needed. So if you want something to finish up your mowing this is for you. If you plan to do a lot of weedwacking get a corded or gas one. Its length and handle can be adjusted to fit your height. I'm 6' 1"" and I can stand up straight using this model at full extension. The downside is the batterys need a long charge so plan to use the batterys only once per day and let them recharge overnight. With only a 2 hour charge they run out of juice very fast."
1,Garbage - the other reviews appear fake,Take a look at all the other reviews - they are all written by people who have given ONE review... very suspicious if you ask me!Anyway - this thing is a piece of junk - it runs out of battery fast - and the parts on mine have constantly broken. I was able to keep it running for a year with duct tape and super glue - but it finally died!Beware!
3,This product has Pros and Cons,"This is a very lightweight grass trimmer that is very handy for small jobs. On tall(over 12 inches)thickened weeds,each battery only lasts about 10 minutes and then the power quickly depletes. I've used it a couple of times since purchased. When I first begin my weed wacking I think...""wow"" this is nice... but after about 20 or so minutes I am dragging out the corded trimmer to finish off the job(and not thinking the cordless trimmer is so ""nice"" then). I expected better battery life for the price of the product."
2,disappointed,"I ordered this based on the reviews on amazon. I am very disappointed in the product. Even with two batteries fully charged it can't finish my small yard. Also the string is worn out in less than a month and there wasn't even a spool in it just one small piece. I am waiting to get the string I ordered so I can trim for 15 minutes, charge overnight and trim for 15 minutes more. Would not recommend on crappy battery life alone."
5,Excellent piece of equipment.,"This is the best battery-powered trimmer I own.It is a solid piece of equipment and works well. If the price were lower as when I purchased it, I would purchase more of these trimmers."
1,Junk,"This worked fine for about a year, then one day it simply died. When it was working, I could trim grass and small weeds for about 10 minutes per battery when fully charged."
4,Cordless trimmer,Set up was simple. I only used the machine once due to the end of the season however it performed very well. It seemed to have enough power to handle all of my trimming. I will write more of a review after the lawn season begins.
3,Disappointing,"I am disappointed with this purchase. I was expecting a cordless trimmer that would come close to the performance and utility of my gas-powered string trimmer. This one lacks the power for any serious trimming and light brush cutting. I handles OK trimming grass in the horizontal position, but it is quite awkward to use an edger."
1,"too little power,batterys suck",I bought the 3 tool set. the batteries do not hold a charge and the lawn trimmer is really very under poweredThese tools are a waste of money.Buy 24 volt or better yet 36 volt stilh
2,Wimpy,"I don't do what I should - weedeating & edging, so I hired a neighborhood child to catch up on the yard - trimming by the privacy fence, edging, cleaning up around the air conditioners, etc. I purchased this product on the advice of someone at Sears, and really regret it. The child came by 3 different times trying to do my yard, but kept running out of line or batteries, and never finished my 1/3 acre yard. Not sure if it really would work as an edger - I finally used my manual edger like I always have. Maybe it will keep the area around the air conditioners clean if it doesn't run out of string or battery in the 10 minutes it will take me to do that!"
3,Good trimmer for very small yard,"Just got this a couple of weeks ago and have used a few times. Very easy to use and lightweight. Love that it is cordless. Excellent for edging but short string length makes trimming other areas difficult. I live in a corner rowhouse thus have a VERY small yard to attend to. However, I still burn through one battery and half of the second to just edge the ~125 linear feet of lawn perimeter. Quite a large battery thus I would have expected it to last much longer. So if you have a very small lot, this is a great product. Anything larger, I would hesitate recommending...."
3,Good for small jobs,"I do not think this model was ever designed for a large job/area or tough weeds/grass. I find it has it place as a touch-er upper when you don't want to deal with a long extension cord or the heavy duty ""artillery"" gas and oil high horse power week eater. For the right light trimming job it is very convenient."
4,jae,Batteries ran out because I had major trimming to do. Other wise very convenient with having to not drag power cords around.
1,only for mini yards with no heavy duty use,"I have found the gas trimmers to be too much of a hassle and I just don't have the time and energy to deal with those. So I bought this so I wouldn't have to deal with the cord. Well, I charged it overnight for about 20 hours (it says 9 for max charge) and it lasted about 12 minutes. I am disappointed and taking it back to the store."
2,disappointed AGAIN,my last corded b&d grass hog was great but stopped feeding after one season. now my new 18v cordless does not have the power or consistent line feed to edge my small corner suberb lot. line feed is no working....
2,Battery life really is a problem,"Honestly, buy a corded device, not this one. Even when switching out batteries to extend working time, the short battery life is frustrating and makes for very inefficient use of time. Just when I'm getting into it, I have to stop and leave a task half done. My front and back yards are 2300sf combined (not big), on a corner lot with grass on the sidewalks. You may be the kind who likes to charge your batteries each day and trim for 20 minutes every morning before the battery starts petering out. If you aren't, please save wasted time and money and buy a device that has reliable, consistent output. I usually don't write reviews, but this is such an obvious issue that I felt it important to let others know."
3,"good trimmer, but battery life is terrible","I have a small yard and can barely finish trimming it with two batteries. These are old fashioned nicd batteries that develop a memory over time so if you recharge them when they aren't fully charged they never really recharge properly again. This is really bad considering there are much better battery technologies available that don't have this problem. Why they continue to sell this product with such terrible batteries is beyond me. Every thing else about this trimmer is fine, but it's all kinda besides the point without a proper power source."
4,Cordless Black and Decker GrassHog,Item arrived in new condition no long waiting period thanks to UPS delivery. The performance of this cordless weed wacker is mediocre to great! Don't expect to cut down tall 2 foot sizes of grass in one stroke it does great without having to bump and adjust the line. The battery life is also great it will last you about 45 minutes for a battery pack so make sure if you have lots of trimming to do that you recharge the packs overnight. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a cordless trimmer and not a gas powered version.
4,Best $100 I ever spent on yard tools,"Does exactly what it was designed to do. Trim a one acre yard. This is not a landscaping, yard maintenance company tool. Residential, once a week use. Have had mine for at least 5 years on same battery. Wife loves it."
3,Stick with Corded,"I purchased mine in the spring of 09 and it worked well. It was powerful enough for me to use as an edger all around the front walks, drive and curb and also the back - all along the foundation and fence. Now I find at the begining of the 3rd year the batteries aren't holding a charge long enough to finish part of the yard. With the cost of replacements I either need to buy an entire new unit or get a corded. I'm opting for the corded."
4,Does a really good job,"I bought this trimmer last fall when we bought our first house. I love not having to worry about a cord and no gas smell. The two batteries are fantastic, we can usually trim and edge the whole lawn one and a half times before having to switch the battery. I love being able to turn the head to edge - our lawn is always well edged compared to our neighbors. My only problem is that after getting about halfway around the house, it's a little bit heavy, and having to hold both buttons at the same time makes it a little uncomfortable. However, I would highly recommend anyone buying this tool. It really does a good job."
5,great,"I have a small lawn and this product works great. No wires, no gas cans. And I can feel like I am being green for the enviroment. Easy to replace spools. Overall nice product"
1,Battery LIfe,The batteries when fully charged last only 20 minutes each and by then the trimmer will barely rotate. Batteries also lose their charge if not used often and it may take three to nine hours to fully recharge. It is disheartening to be almost done with the task and lose power.
4,Good light duty trimmer,"I purchased this trimmer in May 2008 and I am very happy with it. I have used it about 5 times. The majority of my weed trimming is done by a yard service, but I needed a trimmer for touch up and weed trimmer in areas outside the lawn. It is very nice to put in a battery and go. Battery life is good. I can get about 20 minutes of hard use (briars, thick weeds) and about 40 minutes of light use (grass) out of a fresh battery. The unit comes with two batteries. I have changed the ""string"" once and it was easy. The trimmer is light and quiet. May experience with the cordless trimmer resulted in me purchasing the B&D cordless pole hedge trimmer. They use the same battery, which is very helpful. All and all very good product, if you understand your getting a light duty trimmer."
4,Good product,"I have a fairly small yard and this works great. I have been using it for about 6 months now, and the charge has lasted me about 40min or so and has not been a problem at all. I have used it in tall, wet weeds and grass and it only slowed down a hair. It has been much more powerful than I expected. I love being able to grab the battery, grab the very lightweight grasshog, and can be weedeating 10sec later. It's one of the simplest products with a motor I have ever used. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because I am a tall guy and it is a little short for me. This causes me to have to bend over a little and can get a little tiring on the back. But luckily, the entire product is still lighter than any weedeater I've ever used, so that helps. Overall, a very good product for a small to average sized yard. I would definitely recommend this product."
4,excellent light duty trimmer,Trimmer is easy to use and automatic line feed is a definite plus as is the extra battery
3,Decent trimmer/edger for small lawns,"My lawn is pretty small, so for me, this is a fine purchase. I use one whole battery of charge on about 800 square feet of lawn (it comes with two batteries and one charger). Very easy to set up and use. Height adjustable and quick switch from trimmer to edger. A bit handle-heavy because of the large battery.If your lawn is about my size or a bit larger, it's not a bad buy. If you have a huge lawn, I'd probably look elsewhere."
5,Perfect for average size homes,"After having a gas powered trimmer for many years, I was pleasantly surprised to find this one just as competent and the automatic line feed is infinitely better than the old ways. No fuss no muss with the batteries, no 2-cycle oil to measure, no gas fumes on your hands when you are done, and so quiet compared to gas powered. I had experience with other electrics some years ago and found them lacking, but this one lacks for nothing. I have a half-acre and use one full charge on one battery, maybe need the second battery to finish up, but usually not. Also, remember how much more environmentally friendly this is. I have gone all-electric, even a battery-powered lawn mower, and think the new generations of electric are every bit as good for not-huge home lots."
3,"Grass Hog, Battery Hog","Trims basically OK for as long as it lasts. If you have 10-15 minutes worth of weed whacking, by all means, go ahead with this thing. If you have more.....beware. While the initial battery (the one fresh off the charger) seems to run relatively strong and decent for a quarter-hour, the backup is never quite ready ...unless you are willing to wait, and wait, and wait for that one to get charged. What we have here is a situation where a supposedly fully charged battery quickly loses its charge if allowed to sit for a mere day or two off the charger. As a practical matter, unless you have a second charger to keep the second battery ready, this is a small-time, one-functional-battery product.Me, I should have gotten a corded whacker (heck, I've already got a 100-ft cord for my corded hedge trimmer)."
4,Black and Decker Trimmer,"Had to put the trimmer together.Battery is easy to charge and much lighter than previous model I had,therefore trimmer was much lighter then the previous model.Easy to use and does a good job."
4,Love the Trimmer but Lousy Battery Life,"The trimmer is a pleasure to use - light and powerful, but the two batteries that come with it are lousy. I have used the trimmer twice, but both times the batteries have run out of juice before I have been able to finish ""weed eating"" around the house, fence and curb. I don't want have to spend another $40 on a third battery, but I might have to."
2,"Decent, but not durable","I have a fairly small yard - less than a quarter acre total, and did not want to mess with a gasoline trimmer again, and I hate dragging extension cords around, so I bought this thing. Feeling it was a bit overpriced, I was nevertheless reasonably satisfied with its performance. It worked fine for minor trimming and edging as long as I stayed on top of things and didn't let the weeds get too thick.Within the first 6 months (I'm in Florida so I have to cut my grass pretty much year-round) the batteries started to degrade a bit. What used to be done with one charged battery now took a battery change part-way through in order to finish. But I expected that with Ni-Cd batteries.Unfortunately, though, something inside the trimmer broke after about 8 months of use and it quit working. I would not buy this trimmer again."
1,Works fine has problem I hope to resolve.,"Lots of power. Battery is same as other B & D products. I wish that it cut with two lines instead of a single one. Does a fine job for my small yard. After about a month one of the batteries won't hold a charge, and the other seems weak. This might be an older unit that has been on the shelf a long time. It works great but if both batteries need replacing this will be a bad bargain."
2,"Hurts to use it, literally","This thing does ok for a small yard... like, a really small yard. The little metal tab that cuts the string off when it gets too long goes dull SO fast and it ends up not cutting good and shooting into your leg and making you bleed. Plus when the string gets low it runs out extra fast... for some odd reason. Better charge the batteries up for 48 hours if you want to weed eat your whole yard. I have slammed this thing down in the yard a few times and it is still holding up (those strings HURRRRT) so it's durable... anyway.. I wish I would have purchased a nice gas trimmer instead."
2,Grasshog is really more like a toy trimmer,"I purchased my Grasshog 2 yrs. ago and it came with 2 rechargeable batteries. If I get 10 minutes' use out of each battery, I am doing good...and during the last 5 minutes, its already running low and barely able to whip the weeds. This trimmer is single string and won't self feed. My house is tiny and this trimmer should more than be able to take care of my weed maintenance needs. The idea of a cordless trimmer that is lightweight is a good one and is why I made the purchase. However, what good is it when it doesn't have enough power to do the job? Pointless..."
5,Works Well-18VoltCordless trimmer,"Purchased B&Decker cordless trimmer a few weeks ago. This is great for a small yard which I have--preforms as stated--lightweight, no extensions cords. Just charge your batteries and go for it. I was apprehensive about cordless--but it is great. Haven't changed string yet--hope that is easy---try it you will like it--also amazon has always came through--fast shipping--product as described, reasonable prices."
2,Parts missing,"I received this product minus the screws necessary and the spool of cutting string. I called Black & Decker and two weeks later they sent me the screws and spool of string. Of course, they sent the wrong screws. I went and bought the proper size screws at HomevDepot. The trimmer works as advertized, but this is my last Black & Decker product."
4,Generally good,"I only used once since the item arrived. I like it.There are some complaining about short battery life. I did not have that problem. Besides, the item comes with two battery packs.I do have one issue though. The battery charger does not show you when the charge is complete. I left the battery for charging over 24 hrs, the indicator light is still red. I think the battery is NOT Lithium battery but the cheaper NiC battery."
2,Two days for half hour work.,"Working ten minutes at a time. I stop watched the time used on batteries took ten minutes per battery run down stop cutting grass, five hours to charge per battery. I like the weight ideal, but you will need several batteries I suggest buying couple of the extended batteries and quick charger. The standard batteries are weak. I do half of yard one day charge batteries and finish next day. I am disabled so this isn't all bad but is disappointing. Will trim about fifty to 100 foot per battery I have about 100' of house then 150' of fence. Not sure is worth the convenance over $89. For 12"" Black decker grass hog includes two batteries then purchasing +2 more batteries 2*$35.00 quick charger $35. Not to drag cord, when could have purchased electric for $60 last one lasted 5 years. Having problem justifying cost. Black Decker needs to put one hour charger with the extended batteries in this package then this would be good deal."
3,Product is great except for battery time.,I am very pleased with the weed eater except that the battery runs out of juice in about 15 minutes. I have been carrying 3 extra batteries to give me around an hour of weed eating. Other than this problem it is a great tool. It is very light and it is easy to change from flat weed eating to up-right weed eating.
2,Underpowered and not reliable,"14 days after the 2 year warranty was up the plastic stem joint broke while I was trimming. This makes the unit totally useless. After 2 years one battery doesn't hold a charge and getting the front lawn edge-trimmed on a 1/5 of an acre city lot is impossible on one battery. I'm talking the front lawn on a 1/5 acre lot, remember. On 2 batteries there is no way possible that a person could get the front and back lawn trimmed on a 1/5 acre lot. Definately, poor build quality and underpowered. I'm a scientist telling you like it is. If you want the convienence of a rechargeable then buy a second set of batteries. To give you a better idea, I generally do the sides of my driveway, the sidewalk and curb then my front walkway. One battery will tackle 60% of this and the second battery would only let me start the back yard.Black & Decker 18-Volt Cordless Electric 12-Inch Grass Hog String Trimmer/Edger #NST2018"
4,Good Product...Good Value!!,"Used it four times now exclusively for edging and no complaints. The battery last 20-25 minutes and then just pop in the second one. It took me a while to get the hang of getting the edging done right but I keep getting it better and I,m still on my first roll of string too. I like that you dont have to pull the string out or tap it or anything. For $90 bucks its a good trimmer/edger!!"
4,Great Trimmer for the right job.,"I am on my 3rd season with this trimmer and it does a great job. I have allot of driveway, walkway and landscape to edge. It comes with two batteries and I purchased the B&D; blower at the same time which uses the same battery. I have a large yard and I typically use three batteries to get the job done and use the last battery for blowing grass off of the driveway/sidewalk.I went though 3 gas trimmers in the last 11 years and they were always a hassle to start, not to mention you always had to have 2 cycle gas on hand. It does a great job at edging, and trimming other areas around the house.The only drawback is the batteries don't seem to hold a charge all that well when off charger, which prevented me from giving it a perfect 5 stars."
2,Short lived trimmer,"The trimmer worked great - for one day - then it broke. It is going off for repairs, and hopefully it will work a little longer once it's been fixed. Easy to use and trimmed both grass and weeds beautifully."
5,Battery operateed Grasshog,"A light-weight, easily maneuvered, battery-powered grass string trimmer that is simple to use and doesn't require a polluting gasoline engine or an electric cord. The 2 provided batteries last a decent amount of time and charge rapidly. Worth the money for an environmentally friendly string grass trimmer."
1,SPEND YOUR MONEY ON A GAS TRIMMER INSTEAD,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS TRIMMER. BATTERY ONLY LAST FOR TEN MINUTES. IT WILL TAKE HOURS TO RECHARGE. SPEND YOUR MONEY ON A GOOD 2-CYCLE ENGINE TRIMMER INSTEAD; IT WILL SAVE YOU A LOT OF TIME.
2,Ok for light work. Not good for the tough stuff.,"The good:- Light weight- Great for light trimming on a small lawnThe bad:- Not powerful enough to handle medium to heavy work- Not powerful enough to handle serious edging- Battery does not last long enough to handle medium to large lawnsBottom line:- Get this trimmer if all you want to do is trim grass around trees, posts, hard to reach areas, etc. and your lawn is small. It is light weight and very convenient for this type of work.- Do not get this trimmer if you want to do anything more than that. This is a very light duty trimmer and you will be disappointed in it if you try to do anything more than the lightest of trimming jobs."
2,Nice idea poorly executed,"I think the power and run time are quite adequate considering it's cordless, but the contraction is bad. I have to hit the battery to remove it as it sits so tight, after a year or so of having to do this the plastic handle is breaking. If only their moulding tolerances were better and they spent a bit more time creating something that will not break after a year or two this would be great."
5,Love the cordless B&D Grass Hog,"I love this thing. I have an average size yard (8600 sq ft including my house) and I trim all around the foundation, all around my fenced backyard, both sides of the driveway, and the street curb every time I mow (well, almost every time). This trimmer never runs down before I'm finished. I always swap out the used battery for the freshly charged one before I start (it comes with 2 batteries that are interchangeable with all B&D 18V cordless tools). I do know that after a couple of years of regular use these batteries will begin to not hold a charge, then it's time to buy new ones. But the ease of use is great, and putting in a new roll of trimmer line is so easy, so it's worth it to me. I'm spoiled. Never again will I settle for an electric trimmer and screw around with the stupid extension cord, and never again will I deal with the aggravation of starting a gas trimmer. Cordless all the way for me, baby!!! I have the cordless leaf blower, too, and love it."
2,Still looking,"This worked okay the first year, for light duty. It charged out after about 45 minutes. The second year sometimes it would give the same charge(always charging up overnight),and sometimes it would give less. This year it did not charge at all, no matter how long I let it. Felt this was rather expensive if it truly is kaput. I have yet to find a reliable trimmer and I have tried corded, gas, and now this one. Maybe it's just me."
1,B&D Electric String Trimmer,"I have had MANY yard/garden tools over the past thirty years. I bought this because I am recently ""on my own"" and don't have anything else that requires mixed gas. WHAT A PIECE OF CRAP!!! The salesperson told me the battery would last two hours. It lasts 15 minutes. I have given it several tries. I'm buying the mixed-gas real thing today and throwing this in the garbage. I would feel guilty even selling it in a yard sale."
2,Not usual standard,"I have owned Black and Decker cordless products for years. My first was a Canadian made cordless mower which lasted 11 years with year round California use, then a US/Canada model which is in its 7th year. I bought a Black and Decker cordless trimmer which had US and Canadian addresses on the box,but it has been returned twice when the battery failed to charge or hold a charge...it is made of light plastic instead of the tough rubbery plastic in the Canadian/US made mower. I am surprised that it is made in China.(not Canada or USA). I have nothing against China,but the Canadaian products were much better quality. Why not stick to them. This experience turned me away from Black and Decker."
4,"My first one broke, I bought another!","I must like this trimmer because my first one broke after a year and I went ahead and bought another one. Like other reviewers I'll agree that it does a good job of light to medium trimming. I abandoned gas trimmers mainly because of engine problems, noise, smell, weight and heat. With my first grasshog (after a year) the spool decided that it would not stay on the trimmer anymore. While trying to coax the spool to stay on I leaned a bit too hard on the fully extended handle and heard a cracking noise. That clinched it, I retired it and bought another. I looked at other brands of cordless trimers but came back to this one. A few other models had real heavy batteries. This model is reasonably light. The two batteries are more than enough for most normal 1/4 to 1/3 acre plots. If my first purchase didn't break I would have given this 5 stars."
4,Light weight and easy to operate.,"I am a single senior who just can't manage the gas trimmer any more. So I purchased the Black and Decker grasshog and am amazingly surprised on how easy it is to operate. I had no problem assembling it, it is light and easy to handle. The two batteries lasted for my half acre. If it lasts only two years, it will be worth it."
4,June 30 2011 review,"Used this trimmer about 4 times so far and it's working well for me. Relatively light weight and easy to use. Battery seems to wear down somewhat quickly but unit comes with 2 batteries so this isn't a serious issue. Overall, I'm very pleased with the performance for the $80 I paid."
4,No more cords,"We absolutely love our grasshog . We have had one for two years and regard it as one of our favorite outdoor tools. We enjoy this so much that I got one for my father in law for father's day. Only gripe is that we have a small yard, and when we do our front and back yard we need both batteries."
3,1 of 2 battery died instantly,"the grass trimmer is not bad, but what was disappointing, that for the first time of usage, after charging the batteries for the whole night, one of them last only 6 minutes. The second one works for 1 hour with maximum power. I wish I could returned it back, but unfortunately I'm too far from USA. At least it would be great to receive 1 additional battery from which would last at least 1 hour."
4,Nice Battery Powered Trimmer but a little weak,I bought this trimmer because I got tired of gasoline/oil mix trimmers that stopped working after about a year. They are also heavier.This is a nice little unit with 2 batteries (which I need for my yard). This unit does the job for light trimming and edging. It edges nicely with the little wire guide that you flip down when edging. All in all a good bargain priced cordless trimmer with adequate battery power for the average yard. It won't cut through any thick weeds or grass because it's just not powerful enough. It also has only 1 string but the automatic feed works great (no bumping). Charging takes about 10 hours for each battery.I'd recommend it.
3,lightweight,It's too bad they don't make a heavy-duty in cordless. The 0.065 line is too lightweight even for some residential uses.
5,This thing works great,"Used this machine for the 3rd time (as a trimmer). Works fine for my city lot. Still a charge in the battery. Tried it today on the weeds and grass in the cracks between the cement on the driveway and side walk. It took them out, no problem. You do have to hold it at the right angle. I dont think it removes the roots, but better than chemicals. Will try it soon on edging."
1,Blew Up,"We have had this weed eater for less than a year and what a tumultuous year it has been with this weed eater. First, the batteries just don't stay charged long enough. We own a house but on a small lot and only use this for weed eating around the edge of the yard. The two batteries can't hold enough charge to accomplish that small feat in one day. And today, after less than a year, it blew up and the motor caught fire. Do yourself a favor and buy another brand cheap $20 electric weed eater with a long extension cord. We had bought one to replace this one and were only using this one to reach where our extenstion cord wouldn't reach for the other. With that little bit of use (like weed eating our yard just along the street on our tiny lot) it blew up. Way to go black and decker. Way to go."
3,Black&Decker cordless trimmer-good power for short time,"I found the trimmer to do a great job, but power lasted only about an hour before it ran out. A second battery is a good idea, but a second charger would be very helpful."
4,Whack Attack,A lot better than messy gas trimmers for small jobs. No mixing gas & oil and no noise. I still have a dual string trimmer for the big jobs in spring but this 18V trimmer is just right the rest of the summer.
1,2 batteries,"yeah, it came with 2 batteries, but it is still useless in my yard. We have to charge them for 9 hours for them to last 12 minutes each at best. The dumbest thing I've ever heard. Who gets anything finished in that amount of time?"
4,Good but not great.,"We have a very large lot and it is fortunate that this item came with two battery packs because one doesn't make it all the way around the lot. Not huge power, but satisfactory."
1,Bad Battery Life,"The specs. say run-time = 23.2, ... 23.2 what?I can't get 10 min. out it before it dies. Even with the two batteries included, I can't finish my yard. Oh, and it takes 8 hours a piece to charge them back up. Seems powerful enough, but you need a box full of batteries to complete the job.Guess I'll have to go gas, arrrggg!"
3,Good Trimmer / Bad Batteries,"I really like this wireless trimmer and would recommed it for anyone with a small property. It is not designed for heavy duty wacking, but is OK for normal grass and weeds. The issue is battery charge duration...it is terrible!!! B&D needs to offer a longer charge version or this product will not untimately be successful."
4,Great as a light duty trimmer,"I've used this several times and it works great for light duty uses. I just do some edging of our lawn and clearing small weeded areas.The battery doesn't last too long. It seems to be good for about an hour. Fortunately, it comes with a second battery, so it can be swapped out.It's much easier to use than my previous trimmer, since there is no dragging around of an extension cord."
2,LOVE the trimmer...batteries not so much!,"In the two years since I bought this trimmer, I have spent more in batteries than I spent on the trimmer itself! I LOVE this trimmer! But I've decided I have to give it up and go corded. It's just too expensive to buy replacement batteries every year. I keep two batteries fully charged and still can't get through edging my front yard, and it's a standard track-home yard - not big at all! To put it in persepctive, if I were to edge my entire front yard without stopping, it would take me less than 15 minutes. Two fully charged batteries can't get the job done."
4,great for small yards,I purchased this trimmer because I was tired of my gas trimmer. This one is easier to use. I have a small yard and this works great for me. It usually takes me about 15 to trim my yard and have not had any issues with battery life.
1,A waste of money,"I owned a B&D; 12-V cordless trimmer and so purchased the 18-V model when it finally quit. The 18-V model came with two batteries and I believed that it would be just as good as the 12-V model. WRONG! The 18-V model should never have been released for sale! The batteries are no better that a ""D"" battery which powers children's toys. I'm deeply disappointed in Black and Deckers product and am now purchasing other brands of products. I, unfortunately purchased the Black and Decker cultivator, which runs on those same crappy batteries. Live and learn - let the buyer beware!Black & Decker NST2018 Grass Hog 12-Inch 18-Volt Cordless Electric String Trimmer with 2 Batteries"
4,No Messy Gas or Cord,This product works as described. It works great on all except if grass is dried out. This it will cut but does tend to drain the battery. How-ever the 2nd supplied battery is more than enough to complete the job.
2,Trims good when it's not throwing out too much line,"After using this item for less than 3 months, the line cutter has fallen off and we've had the constant problem that the auto-feed allows way too much line to be let out, especially when trimming against a hard surface (concrete, side of deck, etc). I wish I had my old trimmer back that I'd held together with duct tape - it did a better job than this trimmer."
4,Good for small jobs,Trimmer is good for small jobs...grass only..no tough weeds....Wife wanted one to use around her flower beds...light and easy to operate...must have 2 batteries...they don't last very long
3,So So Weedeater,"If you don't have a large area to maintain, this weedeater will do the job but you will burn through both batteries to get the job done if you're lucky. It does work great for 10 minutes or so but fades fast. Still, i am satisfied with it's performance and when you keep up with your lawn, it works good. I do not regret buying this product since it was on sale."
4,Very adequate (just not perfect),"This weed wacker is very adequate for my yard (150'x40' with fences, playset, etc.) Battery life is satisfactory- can do the whole job if fully charged. 12 inches is smaller than it sounds- I would not want to have to whip a large area or large weeds with this machine. My biggest complaint is the vibration- not really noticable while working, but my hands are tingling for some time after I'm done. Next cutting I will wear some thick gloves and see if that helps. Have not used as an edger yet. Price seems reasonable. It's nice not to have to mess with starting the gas whipper. Noise is more than you might imagine from electric, but quieter than gas. Again, this is adequate for my little city yard- I would definately recommend something bigger and more powerful for real work on a bigger country lot or overgrown yard."
3,Grasshog 18V Trimmer Mixed Review,"This is a dual edged sword.Positives: Lightweight, no gas, autofeed works great, two batteries (need both for my 1/5 acre lot).Negatives: Very underpowered, light duty only, single string instead of dual string, short battery life."
2,Hungry Grass Hog,"I owned a lower voltage, believe 12.8V before this 19.2 version. It has been disappointing in a couple of respects. 1) I can see why it was a good idea to include and extra 'free' battery. Otherwise I would have returned the unit because the battery life simply isn't long enough to last thru trimming my very small city lot. 2) The Hog chews up as much string as it does grass. Again, it has used a half spool of twine during one use. The automatic string feed was almost constant.I will say that the portability and ease of use are excellent. The smaller battery makes it ligter weight and easy to use but at a price."
5,Very well suited for cleanup and trimming,"This product (like the similar blower from B&D) is not intended for heavy duty work. Instead, both are excellent for lighter duty ""clean up"" tasks. The unit is much lighter than gas powered, but offers just as much portability. The balance is excellent, with the string head on one end, the battery on the other. Most impressive is the ease with which the head can be rotated 180 degrees, making the unit into an easy to use and effective edger. I'm pleased with the battery life, which is adequate for most trimming tasks. This unit would not be a good fit for mowing or for heavy weeds."
2,Hopefully can be put together,"Instructions are really inadequate - just some pictures to show roughly where things go but no directions to explain how to do. I can't get the screws in the guard to line up with the holes on the frame - I can attach two of the three but the third always misses the hole. Not sure where the nut goes on the handle - here's where instructions would help. I remember now that I had an equally difficult time with my corded Black & Decker trimmer. Once together, it worked fine but it was a job and a half getting all the pieces attached. On this one, I've 9 hours while the battery is charging. I assume I'll be able to get it together then. Something this difficult to assemble should really come pre-assembled even if it means using a bigger box."
2,Stick to Gas,"It took almost a month for the unit to arrive, without any communique from the vendor. The unit does comes with an extra battery, which is really good; however, it lacks power for any serious. The unit could not trim the month old growth. While forcing the unit to trim, the unit developed a terrible rattle. I just stopped using the darn thing! I would stick to gas units."
1,Not recommend. Low battery life. Broke easily,"I had one of these for a year or two and it was always a pain. The battery barely lasted long enough to finish my smallish yard, and eventually it just broke at the handle from normal and careful wear and tear."
3,Short batteries,"Pros : Light, cordless, electricCons : Runs out of batteries very fast, batteries take a very long time to charge"
4,Great for Teens!,"This book addresses so many of the issues faced by teens in the modern world - family fragmentation, multi-cultural relationships and faltering self esteem. Through the main character, Naomi, the reader sees how it is possible to overcome these obstacles and to forge on optimistically and confidently. It is a story that, despite being fiction, will strike a chord with teenagers and their parents the world over. It also gives an interesting insight into life for an expatriate in Japan."
2,Disappointment,"The plans contained in this book are not better than those included in many other sources as incidental material (such as The Anatomy of Nelson's Ships by C. Nepean Longridge). I wanted a scale sufficient for model building. As it is, I'd have to photcopy enlarge these plans to get up to actual size for my model. I had hoped and expected the reverse to be true. Beyond that, the plans are incomplete for my purposes and I will have to continue to look for other sources."
1,owful CD,This is most definitely the worst CD Enrico Macias ever made. I wish I had read the reviews before ordering it. I do not recommend it to anyone who expects the usual beautiful voice and music from Enrico. Too bad.
1,what a mistake,"I was so excited to find something new, couldn't wait to get into the car to hear it. What a disappointment! I can't believe Enrico's name is on this album. Don't waste your money."
1,Tres Etrange,"If you're looking for enjoyment of classic Enrico Macias music that's full of life, songs and music that speak form the heart, then you would not miss much by not acquiring this CD. The claim to fame, that of mixing of his music by various people leaves much, if not all of the ""heart"" of this great artist and human being on the ""floor"" of the cutting room. The heart of his songs is hidden behind what could best be described as attempts at 1960's-style psychodelic effects (or should one say affects?). I've been a fan of Enrico Macias for decades now, and have an autographed copy of his autobiography. There's no greater experience than one of his concerts - more an intimate party than a concert (""maintenant, vous et moi, nous allons chanter ensemble vos chansons favoris""), where a man who's over 60 will perform for 3 hours with no break. Unfortuantely this album was a disappointment."
4,Fun pregnancy read,"This book is a light look at pregnancy-related issues woven into a mostly fun and funny plot. Sometimes the characters' body image issues get a little silly and motivations seem a little shallow, but mostly it is a funny take on being pregnant & how it affects you, your body & your life. I read it on vacation at 7 months pregnant and had to read some parts out loud to my husband because they were so amusing and dead-on. I recommend it, but don't expect it to be great literature or touchy feely about pregnancy."
3,Funny,"I enjoyed this book a lot, and laughed out loud a few times, but I found the main character to be a little vain, materialistic, and shallow, which kept me from rating it a little higher. Enjoyable light read though."
5,Simply Fabulous!,"Notes From the Underbelly is absolutely hysterical, and a phenomenal read. Mrs. Green's writing style, and ability to keep the reader interested, is nothing short of pure brilliance.It isn't often that you find a book that you cannot put down...with 'Notes' you will certainly find just that. Marvelous!"
2,Yawn,"After reading this book AND reading the reviews of this book, I have one question. Were we reading the same book????First off, the edition I purchased had such small printing that I was pulling out my eyes trying to read it.Secondly, this book is just extremely boring. The author goes on and on and on about mindless details and you are supposed to find the storyline somewhere in all of it.I know this is supposed to be a book about pregnancy - that much I got from the cover photo, but you could barely tell by the storyline.This is, unfortunately, a real yawn."
2,TV show is better,Watch the new tv show that is based on this book instead. It's way better! Lauren is her name on the show and she is much more believable and way more likeable than in the book.
5,Outstanding!!!,When I ordered this book I had no Idea of what I was in for. You have to read it to understand what I mean. If you are a woodworker of any type or have an interest in Japanese Culture. You will love this book. I have never met Toshio Odate yet I have great respect for what he has done here.
2,digital is this one worth it?,"after studying from this book, and from being in Yarbrough's class, i found this book hard to learn from. it does make a great reveiw book if you already know digital logic. since it is faily easy to find tables or diagrams of of what you would need. trying to learn it for the frist time is fustrating at times, trying to figure out where he came up with the problems and answers for the examples. another thing that make the book harder to understand was that there are alot of typeo's in it, missing data, and or numbers, wrong labeling. which makes it hard to do some of the homework problems. it is Yarbrough 's frist book, though hopefully he can get a second edition that will be much easier to undertand, and not require mass amounts of reading sections over and over."
3,Great dictionary but holes are punch through words and definitions!,"We just received this dictionary and it looks great and easy to read for a fourth grader. However, the three hole punch through the book goes through the text (the holes are not in the margins as I would expect). Therefore every page has three words where part of the word or definition is unreadable! For a child who doesn't know how to spell a word, this is very unhelpful! One would think a book that states ""fits into a 3 ring binder"" on the front cover would be designed such that the holes would go through the margins!"
3,Box was o.k.,"I bought two of the Silver Wolf boxes for our first Boy Scout camp for me and my son. I enjoyed the wheels on the box. It made it easier to move around. I enjoyed the handles springing back to avoid sticking out, the space and the light weight. The shape made it easy to stack. The trays and the wheels sealed the deal for me. Once at camp, it was nice to keep the daily things needed on the trays. Only problem was that when the boxes were stacked in the trailer with the other plastic foot lockers, it did not keep its shape. The center bulged out causing the trays not to fit properly and making it a pain to close. When we came back, it did regain its shape when we had it closed overnight. I will try to modify it to keep it from bulging out and definitely use it again."
2,Odd combo of 1 Dolly album & 1 budget compilation,"Madacy's 2004 release on Dolly, ""The Very Best of Love,"" is quite strange. It's not really a collection of her love songs, but rather a 2 disc set of 2 previous albums. Disc 1 is the 9-track 1987 RCA budget compilation ""The Best There Is,"" while disc 2 is her 1989 Columbia album ""White Limozeen."" While there are plenty of love songs and plenty of hits to be found, it is just a strange release, and it's quite apparant that no one put much thought into it at all. It would be more worthwhile to pursue proper releases or compilations from either RCA/BMG or Columbia/Sony. You'll get both better packaging, presentation and sound quality."
4,die toteninsel und mehr ...,"Yes, here is offered to you the isle of the dead and some symphonic dances. The pace, tension, timbre ...everything about the isle is great. The other pieces, I do not know but they fill up the cd. The sound quality is great, but the four stars are caused by those dances. The cover -picture is very nice and well, i do not know why on the item here this painiting is niot shown. I hold a version from 1984 where DECCA was still called LONDON."
3,Too much gloom,"I figured this CD is cheap enough that I could buy it for the Dances alone, which I'd heard before and wanted for my collection. The reviews seemed to indicate this is the best CD of this music.I'm glad I had no expectations from The Isle of the Dead, which is at best an outstanding expression of morbid dreariness, gloomy and chill throughout, and amply lengthy for its point to sink in. But unfortunately, the commonalities between the Isle and the Dances are emphasized, not just in the CD booklet but in the way Ashkenazy conducts the Dances. Somewhere, you can buy an account of the Dances with more propulsion and less focus on the grave. Buy it instead, unless you are seeking a therapeutic cure for euphoria, in which case this disk gets my highest recommendation. It is well recorded."
4,"Isle of the Dead is spectacularly performed, Symphonic Dances is great, but not perfect","Given that Ashkenazy is attached to this recording, it seems reasonable to expect nothing short of perfection. Isle of the Dead achieves that status. This is certainly one of the darker recordings I've heard and the sound clarity is crisp, so I listen to it frequently. Symphonic Dances, on the other hand, is well done but inferior to the Philadelphia Orchestra performance released by Decca, among others. It feels a bit rushed at times, overly sluggish at others, and, while it is still an emotive recording, the passion is not as evident as it is in either the above mentioned recording or the Royal Philharmonic recording. If you want both of these works on one disc, this is the one to buy, but this recording of Symphonic Dances is, without a doubt, not my favorite."
5,Sublime Performances,"I recently heard on NPR that The Isle of the Dead was Rachmaninov's own favorite from among all his magnificent works. When you listen to this performance, you'll know why! The Symphonic Dances are also exquisitely rendered. Really, you can't go wrong with the Concertgebouw! In my opinion, don't hesitate to purchase this. I am glad that I did."
5,AWESOME BOOK!,Life changing experience. This book will benefit the life of any man or woman who reads it. This book has something for everyone. I have read the book and have become stronger and healthier as a husband and a father. I have referred this book to couples and after they read this book reported that long time issues have been resolved in their marriages. This book is truly a life changing experience. An awesome book!
2,Out of date!,"This book is out of date and the author is pretty unsure if the code will work for IE 4. The author uses IE 4 beta to test the code. Also, I bought this book to learn about moving objects, this book does a poor job in explaining how to create animation with DHTML."
4,"Not perfect, but better than most","I'm not for sure what the other three readers were looking for, but I found this book delivered on its promises (after all, if a 15-year programmer needs a Teach Yourself book for HTML and JavaScript, how good can he be?) There are some examples that don't work with both, which I contacted the author about, and received an adequate explanation. If you want to get your feet wet in Dynamic HTML, and don't have a lot of experience with programming and/or HTML, this is a really good book to get you started. Unassuming, friendly, and leads you right along where you need to go.Compared with the partisan stuff out of Microsoft, and some of the highbrow reference suitable for a ""C/C++ programmer of 15 years,"" this hits a reasonable middle ground, and works well."
2,Disappointed,"I was disappointed in the book. It lacked some of what had been promised in the way of scientific documention, etc. Just another variation on the numerous spin-offs of the Atkins/South Beach approach."
4,GRAN VERSION,"Un hermoso disco de música británica, con una lectura de gran vitalidad de Sir Georg, como es habitual. Donde encuentro que Solti nos deja realmente pasmados es en Júpiter, su interpretación nos da una profundidad de gran magnitud, donde muchos otros directores sólo nos dan una sensación superficial. El sonido de Decca es excelente.Francisco J. Muñoz"
1,Hard-driven mess,"Compared to newer versions, this recording is probably decent. But compared to the magical recordings of the Planets by such luminaries as Boult, Jochum, or Monteux, it reveals itself as a shallow, empty reading."
1,I wish I COULD review this product...,"...but the sale is outsourced to Target, and a week past the projected delivery date, an entirely different item arrived at my door. At least Amazon seems cooperative in replacing it - they prepay the return and initialize a resend immediately - so maybe somewhat over a month after my initial order, I WILL be able to post some feedback."
1,very low grade plastic model,"Minicraft Models Piper Super Cub 1/48 Scale I had thought it was a Die cast model, but received a very low grade plastic model kit, that is not worth the price I was charged. I’m very disappointed with Amazon concerning this product and the price charged."
5,An excellent source for grandparents of all ages!,Clarice Orr shares her wisdom and experiences through stories and anecdotes she has gathered over the years after talking with grandparents. Includes fun activites to share with grandchildren (a great bubble recipe) and a top ten list of reasons to give books as gifts.
5,My best radio,"Well, I'm not a techie, so I""ve never used SW. As with all the Etons I have (FR400 is good but analog and too much Survivor) this does everything best. Great sound, and I""m not going to use the disclaimer ""for it's size"".I like radios and cameras, and I like them to do the simple things superbly withour over-thinking, and this does! 500 presets-c'mon I can spin the dial on AM, wouldn't remember which was #412 anyway.Now ny typical Sangean rant- the LCD works well, it keeps a charge forever, the ferrite has an indicator for where the radio should be placed, holds signal excellently, headphones (I date myself) or earbuds work well.I still can't understand what Ant Trim means, but why read the manual?Sony stuff is okay, Sangean s***s, Eton rocks!Like anything else, your personal preference is what makes you happy about what you get, you won't go wrong with this. Would love it to have XM capability so I can get reid of that infernal Delphi boombox"
4,Very nice radio,"Seems to be very well made and works well. A couple of things about it, thebass & treble sw does nothing? The ear devices are worthless. Very hard to stand up."
4,Great little radio,This is a great little radio! Reception on all bands is excellent and it looks and feels like a quality built radio. I would have given it 5 stars but the rechargeable batteries that came with the radio don't charge.
3,ehhh,"This radio has great sound, a nice rubbery exterior that can be easily gripped, and so far a sturdy antenna. But the problems are: 1) the scan function keeps scanning and no station is ever picked up, so you are forced to keep clicking the button so it advances bit by bit to find a station to listen to--a real pain in the butt (and finger after awhile); 2) the stations are set on different ""pages,"" so if you press a set button on the wrong ""page"" you get a station on a completely different band, like FM, when you wanted a short waive station; 3) every station has to be set with two numbers, e.g., 0 & 1, 0 & 2, etc. You can't just press one button like on your car radio and find that station. Also, the thing only works at night when these short wave stations can be heard. It is barely worth the $50 I paid for it. So, ehhh, I wouldn't bother getting it. Maybe there are more user-friendly models around."
3,Disappointed,I had dreams of listening to stations in English on the European continent. I have not been able to locate any. Most of the stations I have located are from the United States or in Spanish or other foreign languages.
4,Chaotica - Turbocharger,"In Fort Wayne, IN, Chaotica is a breath of fresh air, being surrounded by bar/cover bands. Highly recommended if you like heavy dace music. Similar to Atari Teenage Riot or KMFDM."
2,Industrial metal-style electro,"I found Chaotica to be mostly filled with anger and angst.These tracks are most like industrial metal music: Turbocharger, Lobotomy, Attack Formation, Drill, I Stand Erected, Project Desensitize.Worlds Without Skies I found to have lyrics that are easier to follow.The one track with a Star Trek theme is Assimilate. Aside: I personally found the Borg to be powerful, much feared, and slightly cool in a subversive way... but none of this is reflected in the music.There are actually three tracks that are passably danceable, and they are Black Rose, Ultra Violence, and Hypergasm.I bought the CD for 50 cents at a National Public Radio sale, so I didn't lose too much."
4,Tony Feher,"""This seems a beautiful metaphor for a queer way of working--and living. For me, a queer outlook doesn't attempt to conform every small thing, every oddball and underdog, into one mainstream way of being. However corny or idealistic it sounds, it allows the space for something or someone to be truly itself."" -- David Gilbert on Tony FeherRead the full review on the Art Book Review:[...]"
1,Poor quality,A 1/3 inch split developed in the wood on the spoon's flat edge after about five uses(I hand wash and dry promptly). The same thing happened to the replacement Amazon sent. Amazon-Great!! Mario Batali- not so great.
1,Do Not Buy This Spoon,"Do not buy this spoon. After using this spoon the first time, I hand-washed and dried it immediately, set it on the counter, came back an hour later and it had already cracked straight down the middle. I have bought many wooden cooking utensils in my life and this is by far the worst ever (and I have bought some really cheap ones and even washed them in the dishwasher)."
1,Don't waste your money!,"after about 4 uses, the spoon split in 2 places. I have lots of other wooden utensils and have never had this problem before. I'm disappointed and very glad I didn't order anything else from this manufacturer. Don't waste your money!"
3,Love this Spoon,This is my favorite spoon. Yes it did split even after curing the spoon with oil. But it's still my favorite because of the way it's made.
3,pretty different from their previous stuff...,"i am a huge fan of thievery corporation and esl in general, and i thought scorpio rising was one of the best new soul or electro-soul albums ever. be forewarned this album is pretty divergent from both scorpio rising and ambassadors of style, which was more drum and bass. this album actually sounds much more like thievery, with some sitar and all, only not as solid. i was kind of disappointed:("
5,"Nice, but I'll go for the next size up next time...","These are GREAT, and are very well made. I was new at the whole ramekin thing when I purchased these, so when I got them I was a little surprised at hot small they were, but that's my own fault for not knowing what I was doing. These are great though. They are about 1/2'' deep and maybe 2'' in diameter. Having the ears on these is sooooo nice as with them being so small it gives me something to grab without ruining what I'm making. Very high quality, and totally worth the price. I am really impressed with HIC products to this point though. We have LOTS of ramekins now, and all of them are HIC, and are all very high quality... :)"
4,Smaller than I though,"These are so much smaller than I was picturing. They hold very little. I bought them thinking of spice bowls while making a recipe, but they wouldnt hold more than maybe 2 teaspoons of spice. They are cute and small and if you are looking for something to hold your daily vitamins or something like that, they would work well."
1,Wow Really,When I purchased these they were going to be used to make and freeze food for faster meal servings. But when received they were so small that one would have to nook 3 meals just to have one meal. Item description was totally off on the overall size.
3,DVD may not work in some newer players,"FOr some reason this one will not work in my Blu-Ray player, but the other 2 disks will. It works fine on my computers dvd drive though. My girls love watching it on my computer but I do wish they could watch it on the TV so I can use my computer!"
1,doesn't play on blu ray player.,"This dvd doesn't play on blu ray players. I tried it on 3 different brands of blu ray players and no dice... I don't know what kind of copyright protection it has, but it's not letting it work.... Thanks Disney."
5,Great songs and video,"My granddaughter loves this! It is written like they are letters from a Princess with a moral to the video. Very nicely done, Disney!"
3,More upbeat songs but still a dud :(,This title has more upbeat songs than the ultra slow volume 1...but it's still not very good. My daughter loves Cinderella and this DVD claims to have 2 Cinderella songs... I was upset (and so was she) when the songs showed the evil step sister and Cinderella's mice friends... With no sign of the Princess. Very disappointing.
5,Wow,"If you have a stressfull life, you need this CD. The massage and meditation sections are ok, but the relaxation section is wonderful."
4,No nonsense numbers,"This book gave information in way that I could relate too. It gave the number interpretations from a spiritual perspective and I felt more closely aligned to them due to this. Also there are references to the numbers being expressed in more than one expression, such as the personality number can also act like the life path number if it is the same number if there are some factors missing in the soul growth of the individual.I didn't always agree with the astrological correspondences given to the numbers, as a professional astrologer, I can get a bit picky with things like that. Other than that, I felt this book deserved a place on my shelf."
2,Look elsewhere!,"Conway's rock 'n' roll years are pretty much ignored compared to his country years (except of course for Bear Family's gargantuan box set) and of course there are those who would like to get in on the groundfloor and see what those years were really like.Direct Source attempts to do a decent set of Conway rock, but it sorely misses the mark. First thing to notice is the picture is not period on the front. Ok, we won't sqabble about that, but there are also a complete total lack of liner notes in this. So, we don't know when anything was recorded, etc.But, to add insult to injury, the sound quality is horrendous.Many cuts are in a very noisy monaural format. One cut seems to be a rerecord(Big Town) and I think one cut makes it in stereo.If you're extremely budget conscious and don't care about the flaws, pick up the thing. But, you'll find you like it and you'll be getting rid of this one!"
1,Shallow nonsense,"Mexico gets the usual stereotypical US world view - donkeys, third world, quaint peasant generosity, etc. A serious issue (marital stress through inability to conceive) is reduced to a shallow story line and a desperately-labored Damascus episode. The only mystery or tension is how the actors kept a straight face. It was so bad I had to watch it all! Leaves me anxious about the state of US entertainment and values in the 21st century. We must, surely, have better things to do with our time?"
3,"Cute story, but not one I'll return to again and again","This was a cute story line, but it left you feeling a little short-changed because they didn't go as in depth into the story or characters as they could have. I never felt like I connected with the characters. I would recommend renting it over buying it."
4,Expecting a Miracle,This was very good. It showed the healing of a family relationship. We need more of such encouraging portrayals today! I would recommend it to all!
5,Loved this movie! inspiring and sweet,Loved this movie! Inspiring and Sweet. Great movie to watch with the entire family! A great purchase! Can't wait to watch it again!
5,Charm Review,This item was delivered within a reasonable time and I was very happy with it. It is very small but the image is beautiful. My sister in law was very happy with it.
3,Originally very good but sometimes a bit long,"I liked the first CD a lot. At first it was a bit hard to get over the tree hugging vibe that you get from his speaches, but the content is solid. The second CD though went into a lot of the Vietnam war and I had a hard time continuing to concentrate on the lecture while the first one I couldn't get my attention away from it. Overall very good though."
4,great collection,"Exactly what I want from an art book....page after page of art. Would have gave this a 5, but the pages are flimsy. The softcover falls apart on a lot of them. What are the differences between the 1st and second editions? I heard the first edition has art that was not included in the 2nd edition. Anyone know specifics?"
3,Exactly as you see it here,"This toy consists of 15 pieces, 3 on each level. The magnets are not super-strong, but once fully combined they are forceful enough to keep the object together. But there's only one way to get these pieces to fit, so you're not going to make any leaps of creativity in fitting this puzzle together in different ways. It goes together exactly as you see in the picture, and that's it."
5,BUG PARK,"BUG PARKJames Hogan delves into the world of micro robotics, corporate greed, and the realm of virtual gaming to create this extremely entertaining novel.Let me sum the book up like this; teenage friendship, a cheating step mother, an easy going scientific father, the fathers military minded best friend and business partner, micro sized robots ran by DNC: Direct Neural Coupling, Ex-business partner wishing to steal the patent for DNC.This book was much more entertaining than I had expected.The story starts with a bang and ends with an atomic blast.Bug Park is a light read and comes across a bit different than other works by Hogan.I was truly upset that I ran out of pages to read. James Hogan has been added to my must read authors list.I highly recommend this book."
5,Bug Park a Fun Ride,"This book was nothing like I expected. There may not be a lot of character development, but what fun! I could not put it down. From a Murder story, to advance technology theme parks and corporate espionage. This is fast paced. A good light read. Hogan knows how to take you on a rollercoaster ride. Get this book for fun. And just relax and enjoy...."
3,"A Good ""Tom Swifty"" Juvenile, ""Jurrasic Park"" in Miniature","Although somewhat lacking in serious plot and character developement, and in technical details (admittedly there couldn't be a lot,as this is an excursion into ""fantasy techno""),it still makes a good read to fill a few odd hours with nothing better to do.A great gift for Christmas or a birthday for the younger set, but a little shallow for the adult reader. Hogan might have done a little better with more action sequences in ""Bug Park"" itself."
1,Mediocre all-around,"The recording quality is mediocre, but enough to hear that Tyrone Heade is a mediocre bagpiper. Surprised anyone would release this and put their name on it."
2,OK but not great,"The tunes are OK but nothing new or original. You can find similar stuff by going to a ceilidh following a highland games in your area, and probably with some better-known names."
4,Pure Gospel,"Attorney Parton is clear and concise: the Gospel is not the Christian Gospel when there are roadblocks between a sinner and the Savior. He presses that all is dependent on the work of Christ. Then, he makes clear the importance of this emphasis in personal life and corporate worship. It is not a ""we're the only ones who are saved"" approach; however, there are clear distinctions made between the evangelicalism of our day and historic Lutheranism. Worth the price and time to read it."
4,some good moments,"this book had some good moments in adventure, suspense and just when i thought i had a few things figured out, that's when i got some surprises. i don't think this book is a five star but for some of the surprises i give it four stars. thankshummer"
3,"Great detail, but you'll waste time...","This book really needs to warn the reader that they are about to read great detail about something they will never use. I would like to make the decision to read a section or not, based on it's usefulness to me. Diagrams ought to support the text around it. I spent a lot of time reading along and referring to diagrams that had nothing to do with the surrounding text.I bow to this master. This same information, organized differently, would make for a great book. Maybe the 3rd edition?"
4,"A reference book, not a how-to","This book is not an explanation or tutorial of how to make beautiful pages with CSS. I think the people who give it below 3 stars may have been looking for that, and instead they should tryCSS Mastery: Advanced Web Standards Solutions. This book IS, however, a complete reference to all CSS properties and values, and also contains some valuable tips on browser behavior and bugs. If I'm coding along and forget what all the possible values are for list-style-type, this is the book I reach for."
2,Disappointed,"I was really expecting to enjoy this book, but I am now having trouble finishing it. The author seems to enjoy telling us how much he knows about CSS and not how we can apply the subject to our own web designs. I also think the book needed some kind of editor or proofreader. Take the following snippet:""The left (or right) outer edge of a floated element must be to the right (or left) of the right (left) outer edge of a left-floating (or right-floating) element that occurs earlier in the document's source, unless the top of the later element is below the bottom of the former.""I wanted to tear my eyes out reading that...."
2,"Disappointing, poorly organized","I'm sorry to say that after getting halfway through this book, I got disgusted with it and am now shopping for another. What bothered me is that the author manages to make CSS look horribly complicated, when the fact is, the authors of CSS never intended it to be so. A book of this sort should start by trying to show how to use CSS in a practical, simple way, to gain the reader's trust that this technology is not off the deep end. Instead, Eric seems to spend most of his effort and time explaining ""what can go wrong"", which demonstrates his own knowledge of CSS but does little to transfer that knowledge to us."
2,Not a book for beginners,"I had to buy this book for an Intro to Web Design class and many of my classmates and I agreed that this is not an easy book to follow. It dives into details without laying out the most basics first. In general, the lack of structure and more complicated than necessary language was confusing and maybe one with previous CSS knowledge would know what he's talking about but for a beginner it was quite unhelpful."
3,was a great book a couple of years ago,"Probably a bit out of date at this point. For me, this book wasn't that useful, since I generally refer to the W3C site for information about CSS. But it's a nice desk reference, and a standard tool for almost all CSS developers. There's probably a new version out by now to address all the developments that have happened in the past couple of years, I would look for that (or wait until one comes out, it won't be long)."
3,"Useful, but nothing new","All the information in the book can be culled from the W3C, CSS specs, and other sources (including the browser inconsistencies), and unfortunately the book will be outdated whenever new browsers that more fully adhere to the standards of CSS2 are released. That said, I find it extremely useful to have the hardcopy of all this documentation all in one place, available for me to flip through quickly to find an answer."
4,Nice review of CSS 1,This book was an easy introduction to CSS1 with a smattering of CSS2. The author used plenty of example code and pictorial representations.
2,"sloppy, useless, incomplete, redundant, conflicting","Working my way through this book, I found that on almost every page I would be scribbling remarks about sloppy, useless, incomplete, redundant, sometimes even conflicting pieces of text.Admitted, there is a lot of information in this book, but there is a great deal missing as well. When describing some CSS feature, usually first a brief (incomplete) definition is given, and then the feature is further explained by giving examples. Working your way through the examples, and combining remarks spread out over several pages, you usually find that not all aspects of the feature are covered. You'll still need to consult the specification at www.w3.org . And that spec comes with better examples, as well.Save your money, buy some other book."
3,Not disappointed nor give over approval,"I bought this book for one reason, to get a basic understanding of CSS. Getting an overall view of CSS and some examples gets done in this book. In depth of CSS, don't know. I can get a deeper understanding by searching the web. I was looking for some basic discription and examples and I got that. I read some of the other views, agreed ""The Definitive Guide"" is a bit much. I would think that the book would be a lot thicker wiht that title. I would probably buy it again under the same circumstance."
2,"2nd Edition, March 2004. Stay away from it!","It's the last O'Reilly book I get!This ""guide"" does not mention what elements are supported by what browsers. Doesn't even mention what is part of the CSS1 or CSS2 standards! (it only mentions these items sometimes within the text, but nowhere else, not even in the pourly formatted reference at the end of the book).It does a good job detailing how to use the elements but that's about it.I think that Thomas Powell's ""HTML & XHTML, The Complete Reference"" does a excellent job explaining CSS and certainly has a better CSS reference in the 2 chapters dedicated to CSS (it's an XHTML book after all, so don't get it if all you need is CSS).I have not checked other books written by Meyer but this 2nd edition is not a ""Definite Guide""!Check your bookstore and do a good comparison before spending money on this book!"
1,Whatever happened to O'Reilly?,"I love O'Reilly books but ""definitively"" not this one!!! What a dissapointment! The author should first learn HOW TO WRITE A BOOK AND THEN, NOT TALK TO HIMSELF OR ABOUT HIMSELF AND HOW POWERFUL CSS IS ON EVERY F'ING PAGE!Did the O'Reilly editors take a vacation?"
3,"Not a practical book, mostly theory.","If you're looking for a book that will teach you how to actually use CSS, you'll be disappointed by this book. If you're looking for a book that goes into great detail about what CSS can do in theory, you'll love this book. But be warned, before you read a section, you should scan ahead to make sure there's no warning that says, ""Internet Explorer for Windows through IE6, the most recent version as of this writing, does not support [whatever...]"" The book wastes a huge amount of time describing things that are not supported. And these warnings are at the end of sections."
2,Not very practical...reads like a dictionary,"I just spent the day reading this book and it's about 10 hours I wish I had back. The book may indeed be a good reference, but it isn't much of a teaching model. With the vast majority of the world using IE, all too often you'll spend time reading a section and trying to understand it only to find at the end of the section a blurb ""This feature is not supported in any version of IE"". The first time it was aggravating, by the fourth or fifth time I began to wonder why the book wasn't structured so that readers could be made aware in advance of theoretical features not yet supported. For the most part I'd have skipped past and saved time.There are simply not enough examples in the book and many of the ones that exist are confusing. I can't quite explain it, I just found the book aggravating. I'm sure I'll use it as a reference, but my impression of it is the author created a reference first, and then wrote a book around it."
5,THE book for CSS,"Anyone wanting to incorporate Cascading Style Sheets into their web pages should definitely read this book. It offers a very comprehensive study of all of CSS/1 and CSS positioning, as well as a fascinating look at some CSS/2 features (which of course no browers support yet). Browser compatibility problems are clearly identified for all properties. The explanations are detailed and easy to follow. This book would serve both a CSS novice as an introductory text, or an experienced professional as a reference book. I would recommend this book as one of those ""must-haves"" that every web designer should have in his or her collection."
2,"Excelent book, but not up to date anymore","As almost all O'Reilly books, this is a great technical book. Great info, great index, and great organization. The author is a CSS guru. Unfortunatelly the contents aren't up to date with the current browser technology. The 2000 edition doesn't even know about the newst Mozilla versions (a.k.a. Netscape 6). Wait for a newer edition, or buy another one."
3,Second edition can really use proofreading,"I worked through the first edition four years ago, and found the book to be very easily followed. I realize the specification has changed, and that the syntax (selectors, mostly) has become somewhat more complicated. AND that the issues revolving around using markup for layout (tables vs. div tags, mostly) have yet to be resolved (and, perhaps, have become MORE complicated rather than less so, due to XML), BUT... the second edition could have been improved with perhaps ONE more rewrite and some proofreading. I realize Mr. Meyer is a busy man, but he could have taken a bit more time updating this franchise."
1,completely useless,"i work as a programmer and occasionally have to get my hands into the design aspect of things, usually cleaning up templates designers have made in some crap gui tool. i understand the basics of css already, i just needed something to outline the syntax and concepts in css2 and then just function as a reference. this book did neither, and i've found it to be a complete waste."
4,a gift,"This book was purchased as a gift for someone who was very pleased with it since it is hard to get this edition, so it was worth it."
5,Light wt and very convenient,"I was going to buy 2 batteries for my other 18 volt tools. I realized that for $5 more I could get 2 batteries, a charger and the cordless broom. That was a no brainer! It works great on my deck, porches and driveway. No messing with gas or cords. I would buy another, as long as it holds up and continues to work the way it currently does."
4,Best of the Available Options,"Well, I bought this for my wife (I have a 2stroke gasoline blower, but she wanted something she could use). She is very pleased -> Hence, I am very pleased (when Mamma's not happy, nobody is happy). I was disappointed that they no longer are pkged with 2 batteries, but spousal unit reports that the charge of one battery is just about right for her. With only a couple of months use, it's too early to report on durability. However, the alternative was the Ryobi (at HomeDepot) -a good looking unit, priced less than this, but with NO batteries. AH, that's the rub, the battery and charger are more than the cost of the B&D; broom, charger, and battery.So, if you're looking for a lightweight broom (not the power of a corded or gasoline blower, but my wife is happy), this is probably the best way to go."
3,"Light, convenient, but weak and brief","The blower is light and easy to handle. Cordless is convenient. But the blower is weak and can only handle a small amounts of dry leaves on a hard surface.Only 5 minutes of blowing per charge on the battery, so you will want an extra battery if you have more than a small sidewalk to blow."
5,Great buy!,"I bought this to clear the small patio at my mom's apartment. Weight was a real selling point, as my mom may want to use it when I'm not around. (We live 3 hours apart.) I wrapped it up and gave it to her as a birthday present, since she has expressed concerns when the patio is littered and she has some mobility problems. I used it twice on my most recent visit and was very pleased with its performance. Mom was thrilled! So if you're looking for a gift for your 80-something-year-old mother..."
3,"OK enough, but not super","If you don't need a ton of power, and don't need long life it a good machine. I would say it last 10 minutes MAYBE at full power, then its dead."
3,Good while it lasts,"I had the previous version of this product with a built in hanger and battery charger. It broke because the plastic fan eventually failed after 4 years but in performed well,even when used for jobs greater than 15 minutes in duration. This model has good air force to move light debris like leaves or dry grass, however the battery does not maintain charge/power for much more than 15 minutes of relatively contineous use. Great for small or short duration jobs but don't rely on this machine for longer than 15 minutes of work."
5,Does the job,"I've had one of these for a few years and don't have a single complaint - light, sufficient battery life and it does what I need it to do quite well (blow off the back porch, driveway, sidewalk, etc...). Battery life has never been an issue for me. Recently purchased another one for my 72 year old father-in-law who was still dragging around a corded blower - he loves it!"
5,Why did I wait so long!,"I am not a big yard guy. I am not a big DIY guy. But I'm trying to change that and I've been working a lot in our yard. I've got a large yard though and lugging around extension cords is SUCH a pain. So I decided to go to Ace hardware and by a gas blower (and edge trimmer), I got the Black and Decker blower and edger together for the price of ONE of the gas powered tools I was looking at. I don't need anything super powerful and these do the job great. Since I have both the edger and blower I have three batteries so its always enough to get the job done. If you are thinking about buying these and dont have need for super powerful tools - I say go for it."
4,Good value for the money,"Purchased this blower to replace a similar one which would no longer hold a charge (replacement battery was more than the new unit). This one has a removable battery (which can be replaced seperatly) - the charge seems to hold for longer than I need for two yards - but it does not have the punch that my old corded unit had. All in all it has done the job decently, is fairly light and a well balanced unit."
3,blower...,It works okay in the garage and on the decks. Best advantage of this purchase is getting another battery and charger to support my B & D line trimmer.
3,Electric broom,"Just got to finish out my line of battery powered items.Works ok but a little weak in blow power. It will do ok if you don't have a lot of leaves to blow,Very quite operating so I am keeping for lite weight work"
4,Great for small lots in town.,"If you only have a few walkways and a porch, this is ideal. It is much easier to manage than something with a cord or a gas motor. It eats the battery pretty quickly though, but you can't beat the convenience of rechargeable. Not powerful enough to blow debris of a lawn, but great for cleaning up sidewalks and porches after mowing. For that, it is well worth the money."
5,Cordless Black & Decker string trimmer,Excellent product. Very well pleased. I have several black and decker cordless products thus I have several batteries to go along with it.
4,Black & Decker NS118 Electric Broom,"Product does not have the blowing power of a plug in electric or gas powered unit. However, around my condominium it works just fine. Easy to assemble,use and stow away.Recommend keeping another battery on hand."
3,Blower,This cordless blower is OK for light jobs like leaf blowing. Heavier jobs need more power. It is very convenient and easy to use.
2,Not enough battery life.,"I was really excited to order this item, thinking it would be much better than my corded leaf blower. I am disapointed to say that it just doesn't measure up to a good gas or corded electric leaf blower. The battery life is the issue. This unit does not have enough battery life to blow off grass clippings off my sidewalks after mowing. Also, the blowing power is often not enough to move things like a dusting of snow or damp leaves. The unit is very light in weight and easy to use, just not strong enough."
3,Convenient - about what I expected,"this blower works well as a quick clean up tool - about all you should expect out of it. We use it to clear the leaves from the patio area or sidewalks prior to raking or mowing over them. It's a lot easier to use than my corded model, but with half the power. I got what I paid for!"
3,B&D Cordless leaf blower,"If you are looking for a blower that cleans more than your back steps of a small portion of your driveway, this blower is fine.However if you need a bit more than say two to three solid minutes of blowing time, you best stay with a cord blower because this one won't do the job. I have a seven year old model with built in battery that runs much longer than this new 2010 unit."
2,"12 MINUTE BATTERY LIFE, 3 HOUR CHARGE (but otherwise great)","I received this cordless blower as a Christmas gift and it's everything as advertised -- EXCEPT the battery life. After the initial charge of 8 hours, I was fired up and ready to use my new cleaning toy. When it started to die after 10 minutes of use, I called the B&D customer service line and the rep told me (somewhat sheepishly) that the factory spec is 12 minutes of battery life when fully charged. Obviously B&D doesn't advertise this niggardly amount, but they don't hide it either. Ergo, caveat emptor. 3 hours of charging for 10 minutes of full usage is highly vexing, mostly because it's a great product when it's in use."
3,Good but fairly weak,"It works fairly well, and having the battery fit in with B&D's family of chargeable cordless devices is convenient, but the output is a little weak. So if you need a heavy duty blower, you might want to get a corded model, but for light sweeping this one works fine."
3,Fair little lightweight Blower,"I was recently given this cordless broom by a friend who thought it was used for cleaning around the yard,It's not design for yards,only hard sufaces like my workshop,My shopvac works well but the blower feature is a bit of a pain and I have a gas blower but it a pretty big shop area with some machines,So Gave this blower a try and I do like it but the battery life is only about 12 mintues.so,if You do decide to buy this it's good for cleaning out you garage and or shop area.BlackNdecker should have a put a cord/recharge feature on this that way you can have extra power when you need to sweep open spaces where the cord won't be in the way.Just a thought."
3,Cordless Broom Light,"The cordless broom is very light and easy to handle. The two batteries make the brrom even more convenient as one battery can be recharging while the other is in use. The power of the unit is adeuate for 'sweeping' paved surfaces but is a bit light for managing leaves on grass and uneven surfaces. In addition, the brrom runs for only 20-30 minutes on one charge; this may be inadequate for larger homes/yards."
2,Short Battery Life . . . Shorter by the Day.,"The blower works OK for very light duty stuff, but the durations get ever shorter and shorter. I've had mine for a few years now, and the only saving grace is it came with 2 batteries. I get about 5 minutes out of a charge now if I'm lucky.So yes ..... this is more or less an adult toy .....weak and cheap. Replacement batteries are grossly overpriced considering the performance they offer. . . they should be about $10."
5,Extremely happy with B&D sweeper,"This is a great item. It is super convenient to clean a patio, carport, or roof. The battery will only last about 5 minutes, but that is enough to tidy up an area around an average house. It does not have the power of a gas blower, but it also does not have the weight, noise, or fumes. It easily blew the leaves out of my gutters. The best thing to do is get 2 B&D 18V tools (make sure they use the same battery). I also have the extension trimmer. There is a battery and charger with each tool, so you can have 2 batteries ready for whichever chore you are tackling. I am very picky and research almost all purchases online before buying. I consider both items to be worth every penny. Rechargable battery tools are the way to go."
3,The little broom with little power,"Light weight but not much power. I had a 12-volt version and it had more wind force. The 18-volt model is OK for small jobs such as blowing off a deck, porch, driveway or garage. The second battery is a must because 10-15 minutes is all you get per charge. The big advantage is portablity; no electric cord to pull around and no gasoline engine to upkeep."
2,"Sweeper OK, batteries don't last.","Products works, but batteries die out very fast. Barely enough power to blow dirt from garage and driveway without changing batteries."
4,cordless broom,This product didn't replace my electric blower but it is great for quick cleanup on my patio and no cords to deal with.The battery could last longer it needs to operate at full battery power to do a good job.I would buy this product again after using it for 4 weeks.
2,not as good as older model,blower is not as strong as my other B and D SAME MODEL. Unit and charger can not be hung on the wall. need to find shelf space for both.older model was hung on charger attached to wall
4,It goes through batteries but works great for me.,"I have several 18V batteries to use with this blower, several power tools and two brush hog weed whackers so it's not as bad about it going through a battery so quickly. (20 minutes would drain the battery) I even used the blower inside my house to blow stuff from behind book cases I can't move easily and the vacuum won't fit behind or below. It isn't too strong for those jobs like my corded blower, just have a vacuum handy and blow short bursts from an angle so you don't blow things back at you. It made fast work of blowing stuff to one end of the garage so I could sweep it up. I also ""swept"" the driveway and patio then blew through the dryer hose so the stuff I missed with the long vent cleaning brush came out via the outside vent. I'm going to find more uses for it I bet."
2,Great when it works,I bought this blower about 3 years ago and it has not had heavy work during those years. This spring when I went to use it--the battery no longer holds a charge. I am very disappointed with this. I have cared for and kept the unit connected to the charger and am disappointed that I have to replace it (or the battery) so soon. I would not recommend.
3,For blowing out garage and walkways,"This blower works well on hard surfaces and holds a decent charge. I use it only for blowing out the garage and walkways; easier to use and not get fumigated with a gas blower for small jobs. I have 2 other hard surface blowers, but this one is so much better; easier to hold and maneuver and blows harder than the others."
1,Virtually useless,"the problem is not with the blower itself. But the battery pack. I had three batteries, two died within a year with only light usage, the last one is now two years old and start showing age. I got about 50 seconds of full speed(after a full charge) then the blower start slowing down, the the extent it's not much faster than a hair dryer."
5,Works Great For Me!,"My sweeping needs are limited to my deck, driveway, sidewalk and, occasionally, my garage. With my B&D cordless I can make a quick circuit of all these areas on one charge. All without the mess, inconvenience and the inevitable maintenance headaches associated with gas powered sweepers. I love it!"
4,Black & Decker Does It Again!,"I have several different B & D yard appliances and have not been disappointed yet. They are all cordless and the battery life gets thru my entire yard. They're not as heavy as a gas trimmer, blower or hedge clipper and there's no pull-starts just push the button. It's also not as loud as a gas fed blower.I am semi-handicapped and have no problem using the equipment because of weight or size. I'm looking forward to trying it on light snow but right now it's great on the leaves and debri that collects on my patio & driveway."
3,It's just okay,This cordelss blower is just okay. Nothing great. It comes with only one battery so I purchased a back up at Home Depot. The battery makes this unit heavier than my previous one (which unfortunately was discontinued) and it only lasts a good 10 minutes. It is fine for blowing my patio and deck but that's about it. Would not buy again.
1,electric broom,"I alreadyhave one of these and I love it but it came with 2 batteries, which is a must. This time the gift for my husband failed because it didn't work at all from the start so we had to return it. Also now the product comes with only 1 battery."
4,"Quick and light, just like a broom","It's a great little product for those light jobs like blowing dirt and leaves off the patio or grass off the sidewalk after the lawn is mowed.It's extremely easy to handle, much lighter than the large, corded ""Hog"" that I also own.This product should be used to supplement, not replace, the larger, more powerful corded blower.I found battery changing very simple and less difficult than the cordless weed trimmer I have (also a B&B product).It was nice to not have to fuss with the 100-foot cord just to ""sweep"" some grass trimming. Quick and easy are the operative words."
4,Works pretty well and I have all types to compare,"I read all the Amazon reviews before I purchased and despite many negative responses, I am quite pleased with the blower. I have two others a Gas and an electric/corded, but I have a pool inset into the woods and getting out the Gas for a quick daily leaf clean up, is just a hassle since it only takes about 10 minutes to blow off the daily leaf collection. The corded I simply did not want near the pool. This cordless, fit the bill. I get about 8 to 10 minutes on each battery. I think if I were going to recommend it, I would for people cleaning off loose debris on driveways, sidewalks and decks. Don't try to use when the ground is wet, as it takes twice as long, but for dry leaves or grass on concrete, it works great. If your job takes longer than 15 min, then this is not for you. Hope this helps.JasonDayton, Ohio"
4,Electric power broom,"Its good for small smooth surfaces such as a deck or driveway. Not a powerhouse,but does a nice quiet job. Lightweight too."
4,Cordless Broom,"It works great for what we bought it for, the deck and porch. The battery doesn't hold a charge long but it's just for small places."
1,Not enough power,"I was so pleased with the 18V string trimmer with automatic feed that I recently bought from Black & Decker that I though the 18V ""broom"" would have enough power to do the job that my corded leaf blower did. I was wrong. I should have suspected something when it was called a ""broom"" instead of a ""blower"". I am finding a few uses for it since it is lightweight and easy to manage but I still have to pull out the old corded Toro to really clean things up in the yard."
1,Weak battery,"I got this with all good intentions. The first time I used it, I was concerned about the short time it worked. Charged again overnight. Used again, another short time. Must be because it is new. Charged and timed. About 12 minutes. Tried again, about 10 minutes. When working time dropped to 7 minutes, I took it back. Glad they had the 30 day trial period. Not worth the money just waiting for the battery to charge, which it apparently doesn't very well.Nope won't buy it again."
2,Shame on you,"While everything from ordering to shipping was perfect, the product is slightly less than an excuse to give someone a job making this blower which really blows. This is Black & Decker's excuse for what's the point...no lasting power whatsoever. B&D should pull this product from offers to the public as it smacks of intent to defraud. In today's world of new age battery coatings for more powerful and longer lasting batteries, Black & Decker should be ashamed. Fool me once...shame on you; fool me twice...shame on me; fool me three times....I don't buy anymore of your krap...ever."
4,Good blower for small jobs,"Nice, easy tool to use. Not enough power for big jobs, however. Fine for clearing the garage, entry area or deck of light debris. Beats a broom."
1,"This thing is a toy, I have to finish the job with my electric blower.","Well I thought it would be nice to not have to drag my cord around any more and to have a quick way to blow out the garage.This thing can not break cob webs loose from the wall. Very weak to say the least. I am really sad as I wanted this thing to work. Yes it may blow grass off my 12x12 back patio but no way would it do my drive way. Run time with good power, maybe 7-10 minutes.After using it I hooked up my electric blower to actually ""clean"" my garage.Certain things just do not work well with a battery."
2,Needs more oomph!,I have used this blower 4 times and find it to be lacking in wind velocity to move light debri from the garage floor and outside deck. I expected it to be close to the power of my Toro plug in blower's lower speed but it is not. I can blow out the garage in less then 60 seconds with the electric blower but the cordless one takes several minutes and agravating effort when use to something better. I bought it for the convenience of not needing to plug in and wind up a cord. The description said it was not for leaves in the yard so I knew I would not use it for that purpose but I expected better on the garage and deck.Black & Decker NS118 18-Volt Cordless Electric Broom Hard Surface Sweeper
3,"Handy, but short battery life and average blower","I have lots of small tree limbs and leaves that come down on my large property, sidewalks, driveway, parking. This just isn't up to the task with one battery, and the blower seems underpowered. Carry another battery if you're doing a large job!"
4,Multiple batteries,"The Cordless Electric Broom Hard Surface Sweeper works well for about 7-9 minutes before the battery fades. I blow the dust out of my garage and clear the driveway, sidewalks and back yard patio using three batteries to get it all done.I bought this product after reading many of the reviews. Most of the negative reviews complained about the batteries. Since I have the string trimmer and drill that use the same battery, I now have five batteries with three chargers.I would not have purchased this product if I did not have the other batteries and chargers. With the multiple batteries I can use two batteries to get all my trimming done, and then use the other three to sweep up.If you have the other tools that use these batteries I would recommend it. If you only use the one battery that comes with the blower, I wouldn't recommend it."
2,Amazon is the problem,Every item i purchased here has arrived in a repackagedbox. Amazon said the items were NEW. BEWARE. They will alsoship older models of what you buy.
3,"Weak power, but convienent","As usual with most cordless blowers, this isn't very powerful. However, as far as convience goes, it's not bad. Great for a quick dusting or sweeping of a driveway or garage."
4,works great,"Works exactly as it says. It certainly isn't a powewr house, but works very well for my needs over the last year! Great purchase!"
4,"""Broom"" is right","As advertised, the lower speed is really only good for hard surfaces. Battery life isn't what it could be, but with two batteries included, it suffices."
4,Black and Decker NS118 18.0V Cordless Broom,Great Product. Versatile.The battery runs down too quickly.
5,Simple and good,"This replaces my old one without the fancy new features, like the vacuum attachments. Great for those quick cleanups. The only thing that could be a negative over my old one is that the power seems far less. But the ease of recharging is a definite plus and I'm enjoying it."
2,18-Volt Cordless Blower.,"Sort of disappointing. It runs out of juice much too quickly.Been using four (4) batteries in succession to clear a little driveway of dry and loose debris.Sorry. Cannot recommend - even for ""little stuff."""
1,Very weak; little battery life,"This blower is very weak, even for hard surfaces, and the battery is short-lived. For grassy surfaces it is useless."
4,best investment made,IT IS ONE OF THE BEST INVESTMENTS I HAVE MADE IN A LONG TIME. NO MORE PULL STARTING OR MIXING FUEL.IT HAS GOT ENOUGT BLOW POWER TO DO WHAT I WANT IT TO DO. THE BATTERY LASTED LONGER THAN I THOUGHT IT WOULD. T SUGEST EVERYBODY THAT NEEDS ONE BY ONE.
4,"Great, but only for small jobs on hard surfaces","This is definitely not a replacement to your existing blower, but a good supplement to what you already have. It has a short battery life and is pretty much useless for blowing leaves off the lawn, but it's great for sweeping leaves and and dirt from the driveway, walkways, garage or deck.I find myself using this on a daily basis in the fall because it is so light and easy to use. I also find myself using it on my roof occasionally on a dry day to help keep the gutters from clogging up.Bottom line: This is a great investment if you need frequent hard surface sweeping. If you only need something like this occasionally, then invest in something with more power."
4,cordless electric blower/broom,shipping and receiving was excellent...this product is good for light lawn work and very good for blowing porch areas
