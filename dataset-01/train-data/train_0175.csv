1,bad product and customer support,"The first one died, replacement has no working WI-FI and in bad physical shape. Called Customer support and they fianlly told me to go to RMA group. Informed then and they put me on hold for 40 minutes. Could not get back after that. So, I have paid full price + cost to UPS back one piece and have a no-working blok of plastice. I will be asking for money back at this point"
5,Works great for Mac. Works with system 9.2 and osx Jaguar,I bought this router and the wireless card to get my wife off my mac because she was always on the internet. So I bought the wireless card for her dell latitude laptop and everything was just plug and play. A very reliable and stable piece of equipment. Once I installed it that was it. I never had to set the config. window on the router ever again.
1,Does Not Handle VPN Well,"I was going to replace my reliable old Linksys non-wireless router with this D-Link one. I chose it partly because of the integrated print server.In general it worked fine for most applications. However, I also use it to access my company's network from home using VPN. This did not work well. I tried both wired and wireless modes for this with no improvement. I wasn't able to download anything other than small files and it had trouble getting updates from the corporate email server.I tried working with customer support but they weren't able to help.I switched to the new Microsoft wireless router and it works fine and is much easier to setup."
2,My experience with this device [stunk].,"I've had this router setup for 3 weeks and it died today. I'm back using my Netgear RT314 which i've used for past couple years without any problems. The D-link Dl-713P suddenly would seem fine but activity is nothing to the computers although the lights show no problems on the device. I checked the settings on the router itself and it shows there is ""modem not ready"", but when I plug the Netgear in, it worked flawlessly... so just boils the problem down to the Dl-713P.Another complaint is the print server part is very slow once there is a bit of activity on the router. Sometimes I don't even get any printouts although the print que show them printing. I don't think this unit works very well at all from my experience. The features listed for the Dl-713P seems tempting though, setup was very easy... just plug and play.I'm taking this broken one back tomorrow."
3,Runs great....well.....,"I bought my first DI-713P from Amazon, and right out of the box, the wireless network failed to work. I upgraded the firmware, and it sprung to life, those barely. The reception was horrible. After a couple of months, I swapped my Amazon with one I bought from a local company and returned the Amazon one in lieu. The one I got from the local company works great, wireless and hardwired. Took some fidgeting and some legally questionalble manuvering, but it works now..."
2,I cant' get this to work!!,"i followed every word of the instruction but can't get the PC Card connect to it. I tried other 3 PC Card (diff. brand). No dice. I tried another D-Link 713P. Wired! It seems that everytime I switched AP, my PC card had signal but very unstable. But after a while the singal was gone again. Then by switching to another AP, the singal was back. Forget it! I got a more expensive Linksys AP (w/ 4 port switch). Plug and play! Better user interface and better looking (I think). I was lucky that I was able to get a very good deal at amazon ...! ..."
4,"So Far, So Good","I bought this WAP and the D-Link 650 card for my laptop. I installed the card WAP in under 10 minutes (including changes to the default configuration: SSID, WEP, etc.) and everything works great. I have the WAP in my home office connected to our DSL modem and primary PC on the second floor. On the first floor in another corner of our house, I have my laptop that gets a solid signal at 5 Mbs. I transferred a 3 MB file from one computer to the other in about 5 seconds!So far, I'm happy."
1,Defective!,"I had been warned by fellow IT workers to stear clear of D-Link, but I really couldn't beat the deal that Amazon was offering for the unit. So I decided to give it a try, my bad! The unit was defective out of the box. It would drop the wired signal in one second intervals on all of the ports. I was finally able to get it to stay steady at 10T Full duplex, but it wouldn't work at any 100 speed. I tried multiple cables and setups, no luck. The wireless also wouldn't connect at all! I called their Tech Support and after talking with them and troubleshooting it even more ... no luck! They said it was defective, I am returning it to Amazon... NO MORE D-LINK FOR ME!"
2,Found defective Wi-Fi too late,"The wired portion worked fine. Tried to use the Wi-Fi about a year later, and it appeared to be DOA. I have a Linsys USB adaptor, a D-link USB adaptor, and a build-in one in my laptop. The OS ran the gambit of Win98SE, Win2000 and Win XP. None can detect the Wi-Fi signal. Tried the most up-to-date drivers and firmware. Nothing worked. I am treating the antena as an ornament. I didn't think of using the Wi-Fi earlier because my laptops are bulky (8 lbs). Should have bought a wired router/PS with uplink port for a wireless AP. This way, if the wireless portion is bad, I'm not facing an eyesore. The DI-713P doesn't have an uplink port. I noticed that Linksys does not sell such a combo. Maybe they know something."
1,Unreliable Hardware,"After the good reviews this product received in August 2001from Mobile Computing, I purchased one. In the first sixweeks, it required frequent reboots, probably from itsweak firewall capabilities. Finally, it just stopped workingentirely and couldn't be reached by ethernet or over theserial port via a null modem cable. The replacement unitdid the same thing in about 2 months.D-Link technical support is extremely unresponsive. It isalmost impossible to reach a person by phone and ""a certifiedengineer"" never calls back.Stay away from this product and avoid D-Link because of theircomplete lack of technical or product support."
2,You get what you pay for,"The firewall/router part of the box so far has been flawless, easy to set up and works as advertised, but the wireless access point portion has been extremely disappointing. I am having the same problems as others who have reviewed, the wireless works fine for about 10 minutes, then begins disconnecting and giving horrible signal quality. This was with a D-Link DWL-650 and a Lucent Orinoco Silver, both doing the same thing even sitting right next to the box! Do yourself a favor and pass on the DI-713p. Get the wireless access point separate from the firewall/router."
2,Wireless functionality did not work,It was very difficult to get set up. The Linksys BEFW11S4 was much more simple to set up. I bought the 713P and the wireless part didn't work and then I bought another one and the connection was so weak. My computers are in two separate rooms with two walls between them and the signal strength was always at none or weak. I didn't like the Dlink compared to the Linksys one.
1,WOOF!,"When they quit printing paper manuals some companies apparently decided: ""Why have a manual at all!""To be sure, this has a manual, but it isn't a manual worthy of the name.I bought this product and the Dlink laptop card back in March and I still haven't been able to get it working. With my 30+ years in the IT field you'd think a consumer product wouldn't be much of a challenge, but with the dearth of support from Dlink and the lack of anything resembling a useful user's guide - well, what can I say? Maybe you should consider spending your money on another brand like Linksys."
2,Extremely difficult to configure,"I am very disappointed in this product. For a novice user it is extremely difficult to configure. I have a windows 98 desktop and it couldn't detect the router. I couldn't upgrade the firmware like others said cause it wouldn't even detect it. The windows xp laptop did detect the router but I couldn't get it to work because the product came defective. I spend four days trying to install it and an hour with the D-Link tech support. Their magical formula was hold the reset button for 5 sec, and while holding it unplug the power cord for another 5 sec. Still holding the reset button, plug the power cord back in and wait another 5 sec. It didn't work for me cause they determined my router had defective ports but you can give it a try. However, I did find the tech support nice and helpful, unlike what the other reviews stated. For AT&T cable modem users, you must register the router's MAC address with AT&T to work."
4,Wireless freak,"I like this product very much, easy to set up and i can use my laptop in my yard ( 100 feet from unit) overall I am glad I purchased it...."
2,Problems with the install and now it's broken!,"It took a couple of calls to technical support to configure the DI-713 router to work with my XP laptop and to tie it into Sprint Broadband. After a couple of frustrating days, it worked fine. Now, three weeks later, it has stopped working with the internet. After calling technical support, it appears that the router is no longer recognizing the WAN port, so I have to send it back for repairs."
1,"2 weeks working, then dead","Same problem as other people here have stated. Worked some what for the first two weeks, though my connection to one of my computers constantly dropped off. Now the unit is locked up and doesnt function at all. Customer support? LOL - Documentation lacking...Buy at your own risk"
1,Weak Support. Received Defective Product,"Customer service was generally not helpful. For one thing, they do not seem to have a checklist or any kind of strong customer database to systematically walk you through steps to solve your problem. Dlink customer service also seemed to have several trainees when I called, and supervisors seemed unwilling to step in more quickly when these trainees floundered. The representatives often gave oversimplistic answers: ""buy a crossover cable"" or ""we don't support that operating system"" without explaining why or making any kind of suggestions. Too often, you are left feeling that you are trying to figure out the equipment on your own. Additionally, after several calls, customer service found that I had received a defective item. If you are completely new to networking/home networks like I am, such customer support makes this a weak solution for the home user."
2,"Poor setup, poor link quality, terrible documentation","I've had my DI-713p for a couple weeks now, and it has yet to impress me. I had numerous problems during installation--none of which were covered adequately in the manual's troubleshooting section--and still have yet to get encryption working properly. Once I did finally get the network working, I tried my computer upstairs (I have a small two-story house), and the link quality and throughput were both terrible. This is the only wireless router I've tried, so I can't really say how it compares up against the others, but I wouldn't recommend this router to anybody. If you do buy it, for whatever reason, make very sure you get the firmware upgrade (which itself is a major challenge to track down on dlink's site) or you'll end up with random lock-ups."
4,Reliable,"In September 2001 I set our office up with a Broadband 802.11B Wireless Router from D-Link. That puppy gave me fits. I couldn't keep anything connected. Finally about a year ago it got so bad I replaced it with this router and access point.Setup was easy, range is sufficient for us-- A two story 1890's home make into an office, and most of the network problems eased into oblivion.I thought we were having a problem last week but it turned out to be a Siemens Wireless Network connector in its last throes.When it comes time to replace this router I'll probably go for a D-Link again."
1,Print Server Doesn't Work,The wireless networking is fine. The print server doesn't work. The documentation is sparse.
4,Useful and works,"After connecting it, the web-based setup was fairly easy. Unlike a previous reviewer, I have no problem with my Cisco/Aironet card on my laptop. It worked without WEP without any problems. Setting up the 128bit WEP and renaming the SSID was a bit more trouble, but probably more because of not reading the manual first. Performance and reach is great. VPN connections work out of the box and gaming over the LAN works without a hitch.Reasons for only 4 out of 5: the manual could be a bit better and the need to download newer firmware.As an aside, Windows XP's wireless LAN tools are very user-friendly. Setting your PC up is a breeze."
3,will NOT work with Cisco Aironet Card,"It works great in other parts so far, just everytime it tried to establish connection with Cisco Aironet Wireless Adapter, it reset all configurations back to Factory default, and then no luck."
4,"Works, Most of the time","This is a good product that does what it says it does, most of the time. The reason I dont give it 5 stars is that every once and awhile it becomes dumb, it simply forgets that there is a cable modem hooked up to it, and the only way to fix this is to reboot it. It is a minor inconvenience, but can cause quite a bit of frustration in critical moments."
2,Don't waste your time,"Product seems to be OK but if you run into any trouble forget about it. D-link tech support is clueless. They can't speak English, and they have no knowledge of their own products much less basic networking. I bought a D-Link wireless USB NIC along with this product. Tech support could not even tell me what one of the two products was at fault. I'm returning both items and I'm getting a Linksys router and NIC. You get what you pay for, and I recommend you pay a little extra for another wireless brand."
2,Never Recognized WAN for Internet,"I was not able to get this product to connect to my cable modem provider, RCN. Although the network worked internally, it never could receive a signal from outside my LAN. I spent four sessions on the phone with Tech Support from their third party vendor (Support Concept) and did not get it to work. The configuration was a one-way cable modem with Hybrid cable box. This experience was the opposite of that which I had for Linksys BEFSR41 4-way cable/DSL router which recognized the network immediately."
3,The router works great except wireless part!,"... The router looks very stylish and is well designed. I have no problem setting up my cable connection on this router after some messing around. The wired sharing parts works great, however I couldn't get my IBM Wireless Lan Card to work this router. No matter how I changed the setting, the wireless connection wouldn't work. Others have these problems too in some of previous review. So I decided to get another SMC Baaracade wireless router from Compusa since it's on sale. After all the same setup, I turn on my laptop, my msn messenger immediatly signed on with 11meg connection. So if you can get wireless part to work, this is sure a nice router."
1,Defective units,The D-link 713-p came in defective and Dlink has had a very big problem with this unit.Think twice about buying this you've got a 50/50 chance of getting it to work.
1,"Wireless for a little while, a few minutes usually","After sending the first one back because it was Dead on Arrival, I figured I'd be okay. Nope. My wireless card connects at a blazing 11 Mbps, DHCP gives me an IP address and I'm off surfing. Then I lose connection. I reboot the computer, nothing.HOWEVER, IF I REBOOT THE ROUTER, I GET CONNECTIVITY AGAIN (FOR A FEW MINUTES). Do not buy this router. I've connected to a friends Linksys and stayed connected. I gather from these two things that it's the router that [stinks], and me for not just getting my money back when the first one showed up dead. D-Link has *no* quality control."
3,good router for it's time,When it worked it worked well but after only a few months it had to be sent back to be replaced. The new one lasted for about 2 years untill the wireless side died. I was still able to use it hard wired up until I replaced it this past year with a newer model.
3,The rebate never arrived,They didn't send me the rebate at all. I received a card telling me that they could not find the UPC number in my envelope.I had to call them to tell them I did sent it. They took a few weeks until I called again. They ignore me until I got tired of calling them.
4,Update on my earlier review,I wrote a review some time ago giving it a 4.In the meantime I tried to upgrade to the lastest firmware from my laptop using the wireless connection: VERY BAD IDEA. I basically fried the unit.However customer service was good. I got a replacement (after a couple of weeks shipping and waiting) at no cost.I am using it with VPN and have had no problem (all problems so far were VPN issues)...
3,"Internet Good, Printing Bad","I bought the DWL-500 with this unit and everything works fine for sharing high speed internet access (worked with DSL and cable). Unfortunately, it does not allow me to share my printer as advertised - it turns out D-Link has a very short list of printers compatible with the unit (check their web site). The technician begged me not to bite his head off when he told me the news - obviously used to some rather negative feedback about this shortcoming."
4,Solid but first unit I got was defective,"...The unit worked out of box! Setup took me 5 minutes!Works great - rock solid, not a single problem in a month andI am using it all the time (2 wired and 1 wireless computer).Range is more than sufficient-neighours in houses next to mineare able to catch it. I like the setup page very much - coolestthing is ability of associating fixed IP with given MAC.."
3,On second thought...,"I had given this product 5 stars based on a very impressive initial experience. ...What happened was that the 713P's became 'confused' by my attempts to configure a static mac address-based ip from a wireless client. Actually, its a bit more than confused - it won't respond to a ping, and it will not reset, no matter how many ways I try. ...... which I recommend anyone reading this consider, no matter how appealing the 713P's price/feature ratio. And also be wary of SMC, as well as several others using the same chipset. It's a shame but there doesn't seem to be a clear winner out there in the consumer wi/fi market."
3,"Great Product, Worked right out of the box","... My cable company uses the MAC id to allow internet access. Once I clone the MAC ID everything started working for me. Now I can take my laptop and work where ever I want in my House.However after using tis for more than 4 months I have noticed the wireless signal strength is going down when i use my cordless phone, panasonic 2.4 . Sometimes I don't get any signal while using my phone."
2,Wired worked great but wireless a lemon,I had the wired setup of this router working in 10 minutes. The print server worked well too. But I could not get the wireless to work. After talking with three different D-link support reps all trying different network configurations for a total time of 8 hrs I finally followed the suggestion of the last rep and send the unit back. ...
2,Wirless networking SHOULD be easy! Green/Silver 713p,"I recieved a defective 713p. Router works wired, not wireless. VERY POOR documentation included with product and on Web site, no excuse for the later. L1 tech support is not trained, first guy told me that Dlink cards have known issues w/win2000, second guy could not tell me if problem was card or router. Neither could escalate me to Level 2 support, they took my contact info and told me to wait 2-3 days for Level 2 to contact me. I finally got hold L2 rep who knew what he was doing 7 days later L2 rep calls me from original call(s)Dlink=No Mac Support : ("
3,WEP does not work,"Good price (especially with recent price fall and rebates) with excellent features. Easy to setup, I was up and running in less than 10 minutes out of the box. No problems with interworking with 802.11b Wireless lan cards from other manaufacturers (Addtron, 3COM and Buffalo), but I simply cannot get WEP (64 bit or 128 bit) to work with this product despite many hours and numerous exchange of emails with D-Link technical support and numerous firmware update.I found the printer server feature was extremely easy to setup and has been working very reliably and faultless even though I have a really ancient Kodak laser printer.If WEP is important to you when interworking with wireless cards from other manufacturers then this may not be for you."
1,"Looks great on paper, but failed to deliver","I found the router of my dreams - wireless, 3 ports, plus a print server, plus a $50 rebate. This was one of those things that sounded too good to be true - unfortunately, it was. When I first fired it up, everything ran great - wired and wireless (D-link DWL 120 and Orinoco Gold PC card). I was very excited and dismantled my existing Linksys router and add-on hub. My mistake b/c 30 minutes later, the router lost its wireless signal. The wired signal was solid though. I thought maybe it was a fluke so I unplugged it and replugged it and everything came back up.... this time only for 5 minutes!! ... I fought with it for several hours until giving up..."
3,Works great but not compatible with newer products,"This is a great router / access point.... very easy to configure... and the range is extremely good. Besides you also get the print server functionality, and the ability to add an external modem on the COM 1 port as a backup to your broadband.The only reason for a rating of 3 (and not 5) is that it is not compatible with newer DLINK products like the 900AP+... so if you think you might have to extend your wireless range in future, consider another product."
1,Should've bought a Linksys,"Bought the D-Link DI-713P Wireless Router 4 months ago through Amazon. Have not been able to get it to work with SBC Ameritech DSL provider. Have been shuffled around from tech support rep to tech support rep for almost 4 months now. They could not figure out why it didn't work so they punted and sent me a replacement router, hoping that it was a hardward problem. No dice, same problem. A buddy of mine also wanted to go wireless and asked me to help him out. He's on SBC Ameritech as well, but is moving soon to an area that is serviced by Direct TV. He wisely called them up to get a recommendation regarding routers and was told that most of their trouble calls come from D-Link owners. So we got him a Linksys yesterday. It literally took me 5 minutes to get everything out of the box and working. I'm still waiting for a promised call from Dlink's ""level 3"" tech support."
1,My wireless also stopped working 2 months after I had it,The real problem is they sent a replacement unit to me and it also didn't work. I'm now waiting for yet another replacement to be sent.... More to follow.
2,Ehhhhh....,It was lot BIGGER than I thought so that was a positive but it is so floppy...I wanted the doll to sit up like shown in the pix but that is impossible. the head will flap back and the legs and arms are all twisted...It was lot uglier than the picture too... I wouldn't recommend it...I wanted to display this as part of the Decor for the Dr. Seuss birthday party but I don't know how I would do it. I might need to glue it onto a sit or something...
4,We loved it,"I bought this product for my neice, and she absolutely loved it. She wouldn't put it down. The best thing is, I caught her mother carrying him around half the night, saying how soft it was. This is a wonderful product, worth the money, and will not dissapoint!"
2,not well made at all,The head flops over ...you have to prop it up or it drops completely forward or backward (like it is understuffed or something).
5,Excellent!,"As with all other Manhattan Toy toys I've seen, this Cat in the Hat stuffie is simply gorgeous! high quality, much better looking than the pic. My 3.5yr daughter LOVES Cat, watches him every day & will be thrilled to have her very own!"
4,small light,"Exactly as pictured, I was just a bit disappointed that the light was so minor in the switch, instead of lighting the whole switch up."
3,Doesn't work with JBL N26AWII... well...,"I used these for the A26AWII speakers, however, I had to MAKE a custom bracket in order to attach them to the back of the speaker... Also the size/weight of the N26AWII's are a bit too much for these brackets. They may work well for other speakers, but don't waste your time trying to use these on those JBL's. I plan on swapping these out for a sturdier total custom bracket (since I can't find the JBL bracket ANYWHERE!!)The only reason I bought these brackets for this project was because Amazon suggested it. Amazon was wrong..."
4,Not Strong Enough,"Have speakers the weigh 8.3 pounds They hold them, but bend way down. Great price for holding a lighter speaker"
5,6 classic horror films!,"This box set contains 6 early horror films that remain classic to this day: The Phantom Of The Opera [1924] w/Lon Chaney; The Cabinet Of Dr. Caligari [1919] w/Werner Krauss; Nosferatu [1922] w/Max Schreck; The Hunchback Of Notre Dame [1923] w/Lon Chaney; The Golem [1920] w/Paul Wegener; Dr. Jekyll And Mr. Hyde [1920] w/John Barrymore. Far from being camp, each of these films (especially Nosferatu!) retains the power to creep you out!NOTE: Films are in Black and White but ""Phantom"" has been restored with its original early color sequence that was dropped from other releases."
4,Good movie,"This is a beautifully made movie. I am a Spanish teacher and there are few movies that I could show, this is one more to the list."
5,great idea,"A young boy who can ""only"" communicate through light tries to find his place in this world.He soon discovers that someone is after him and his gift.A great idea, very well written and a real pageturner - I hope to read more books by this author soon."
3,did not hold up,Wore twice got wet now sole coming loose. Glue did not hold up like it should have very disappointed in it
2,economics for dummies,"the level is for high school, the explanation is clear but, it does not have enough problems, one of the worst books that I ever read"
3,I Would Rather Sleep in Texas,The book is well written. John B. McAllen is my grandfather. I see no mention of my mother nor her 3 sisters. In order to know all about John B. McAllen I think the author should have included this portion of his life and children in her book. There are many siblings involved who have done very well for themselves.
4,good book,unfortunatly there is no real video of willie mosconi that I could find.the insturction in this book is not overwhelming and informative. but you will want to go back and read this again when you get to be a better player. You may interpert the instruction differently. Great book.
3,media mailed.................,"The book was as said in good shape.Almost new to me.It was mailed Media mailed which is slow in coming,sure it came in time that Amazon allows but that covers for back orders.Because it comes from Goodwill that means it gets a pass to max profits,I don't think so.Michele wrote me to take back my reveiw and e-mailed me to do so.2-3 times.If you act like a business then act like a business and provide the best service you can.When you are charging for that service provide it.Charity gets the stuff thru donations,charge for it then wants to make more for mailing it,O.K. just don't go over board when you don't get the reveiw you want and spam to get it.I thought I was being fair,Michele thought I wasn't.I give to charities every month but don't like being taken.If they only mail once a week that would be nice to know or whatever.Read my reveiw of Maddog buying the book from the same neighborhood maybe you will understand."
4,Worth a read,"This is an enjoyable story about two women just before and after the end of World War II. It's a classic story of two people who probably shouldn't get along finding they really have a lot in common. As a historian, I have some problems, especially with the second story. They mention the characters wearing pant suits and jeans. Jeans weren't common for women in the 1940s, especially outside the US, and I'm not sure pant suits were even invented yet. It's also difficult to believe that, once again, everyone who knows these two, except for the bad guys, of course, totally accepts their relationship. Society just wasn't that accepting then. And did lesbians even call each other ""wife"" yet? It is a nice story, but don't read it expecting to find passionate sections. Love scenes are handled very much like the old movies, everthing happens without the viewer seeing (or reading) anything. If you don't mind that, you'll enjoy this story."
2,more Shock Value than any real Shock,"this film starts out interestingly then it becomes a bad Sore Joke.it tries to be many things without doing any one thing well to me overall.i felt it was tired in spots&never could hold up fully all the way through.it wanted Comedy,suspense&Romance but never fully developed none of them fully."
1,A big disappointment,"This movie stars Steve Martin, Helena Bonham Carter, and Laura Dern, three terrific actors. And in fact, this movie was very well acted.But the story was just intolerable. Martin plays a gullible dentist drawn into a plot to steal his office narcotics & hijack his business. But Martin's character, Dr. Frank Sangster, makes one incredibly stupid decision after another, to the point of unbelievable absurdity.For the most part, the story was dull. The plot was dumb, and the villains motive is never explained: why would someone develope such an extremely elaborate plot to steal a dental practice? And the final ""twist"" that other reviewers refer to was even more absurd. It was painful to watch this movie.But the biggest mystery remains: how these wonderful actors got suckered into this movie?"
1,This movie deserves no starts at all.,"This movie is perhaps the worst movie I have ever seen. It literally made me sick. As in, vomitting in the lobby. I, of course, did not make it through the whole movie, but I cannot even imagine how it might redeem itself. It was violent and gruesome, had a sickening, depraved story line and was not even a tiny bit funny. I fail to see why it would be billed as a comedy. I would guess that half the audience in the theater I saw it in walked out halfway into the movie. It was that bad. I am mad that I wasted my time and money."
2,fast acting soporific,"The difference between watching this movie and actually visiting a dentist is that there is at least far more stimulation with the latter experience and at times less pain.Anyone who watches a movie that contains Steve Martin has high hopes. While the premise of this film is witty and highly creative, it ultimately lets the viewer down, worse than any depressant I've ever taken.Twisted, non-sensical and certainly humorless dialogue is delivered by an awkward cast and a vacuous script. The movie put me to sleep in the first five minutes, a much quicker acting soporific than Novocaine the drug and with a more bitter aftertaste."
4,"ODDBALL SUSPENSE COMEDY, WORTH A WATCH","Novocaine is labeled as a dark comedy in the reviews here, a conclusion I don't necessarily see from the film. It is nuanced entertainment, you don't expect anything else from a Steve Martin fare, and it does have its quirky elements. But I'd perhaps call it a murder suspense thriller with wit. Just go with the suspension of disbelief, and enjoy the plot twists as the craziness of the ""decay"" takes its hold. Recommended!"
2,Safe for those allergic to nitrous oxide.,"WARNING: May induce Novocaine-like cerebral symptoms.Known to cause slight post-viewing disappointment or indifference.Some have been known to experience a few brief moments of humor, but no actual audible laughing has been recorded.Intercut clips of mastication and ingestion used to supplement affect.Causes some moments of discomfort due to tooth extraction, but less than knowledge of exposure to whole viewing procedure.Accompanying sucking noise heard by many viewers identified as time wasting away in void of average cinema.Some types may enjoy the temporary numbness, while most are likely to wish they had been put under so they would've never experienced the procedure.Talented actors and comedian used to humor new director.

1,Not worth your time or energy,"I would have to say that this is the worst Steve Martin movie. We decided to watch this movie as a family, and not only where we all confused but the ending was probably the best movie. I am not sure what would have made this movie a good movie because most of which I would remove. Allot of people had said that it was a comedy but I would have to say that it is a Dark movie. The Plot is not good the writing is not that good and it went unnoticed as a movie for a reason I am sure. I would not waste my money or time getting this movie."
3,Martin has done better,"I was not comfortable watching this movie...I could not, for the life of me, figure out what it was trying to be. It sure wasn't funny, unless you think that funny is laughing at something that makes you cringe. And it wasn't serious because there were too many pratfalls. So what was it?I thought it was a shame that such a good cast was utilized for a film like this. Not that it was bad, per se, but it just was not good. Can you tell that I am ambivalent about ""Novocaine""?One of the best elements was the music. That is the only thing that seemed to hold the movie together."
3,Steve Martin Naked,"That's what it's all about.For those of you who were disappointed in ""Cheaper By The Dozen"" for its lack of nudity, this one's for you. In the special features, Steve talks about what drew him into this neat little project. He pointedly does not mention that it was a chance for him to appear naked (seemingly) with Helena, which is something not to pass up.He's perfect as a dentist with a perfect life, which is at first slightly tilted and then upset completely. He manages the required transitions of character with brilliant understatement.It's his finest movie since Parenthood, and deserves your attention. You probably won't want to watch it more than twice, though. It's a plot twist special, and besides, how many times can you watch graphic tooth extractions?"
4,Martin Plays it Straight,"Took me a while to understand that this time out, Steve Martin was going straight. I also had to swallow my natural distaste for the dental chair to stay with the film; had I but known what was coming, however, I might have made my getaway early.At any rate, as a Who Dun it, it is watchable and, while not in the top drawer, is better than a typical B picture. Martin stays in character, without reaching for a laugh when he thought the script was letting him down. The supporting cast is good, the script fair to middlin'. Of course, it is the star who holds the thing together, and manages to keep us from laughing when a laugh is not called for. There is some sex and language which should not disturb most viewers."
5,At par with Shop Girl,"This isn`t your typical Steve martin movie where he`ll act goofy. its serious just like shop girl but this movie could be received well. if they `ve used some other actor but Martin did justice to his role. its just, we aren`t used to watching him doing serious drama.Mainly if you are in health care profession then lesson you can learn from movie is,not to be deceived by looks it can cause lot of trouble for you .Movie starts slow but then evolve into better and better play .Nutshell story is About a dentist finds himself a murder suspect after a sexy patient seduces him into prescribing her drugs."
2,Not one of Steve Martins best.,"An interesting little film with a very few laughs. However, the overall feeling of this film was more of an 'uncomfortable' rather than a 'Steve Martin funny'. I was disappointed and would not recommend it."
2,Maybe better with Lidocaine?,"Dentist Frank Sangster's (Steve Martin) quiet life is turned upside-down when an odd new patient (Helen Bonham Carter) starts a spiral of drugs, lust, and murder.I was hoping Martin would play another wacky dentist like his character inLittle Shop of Horrors, but no such luck. This movie isn't a comedy and is too awkward to be a drama/thriller. Dr. Sangster is so relentlessly bland that he's too dull to care about, and Carter's slutty drug addict character is completely repulsive. Even with the two big stars plus Laura Dern as Sangster's fiancé, this feels like a low-budget, indie film with much ham acting and plot holes galore. The truly hideous finale will leave you cringing; all in all it's a big disappointment."
4,Small book packs a big punch,This was an excellent short read - one of those that stays with you as you ponder it for days afterward. Driscoll took all of these thousands of disheartened man-beasts and gave them something: hope. Too bad that this author's other works never caught on as well.
1,"This is for books what ""Plan 9 from outer space""is to movies","This book will make you truly appreciate the genre of science fiction. However, it will do so because it is so bad that any other book will seem wonderful by comparison.The plot: People kill each other in a ""deathship"" until a blind guy (whom the author keeps forgetting is blind) sees a way to build order out of chaos. After escaping from the deathship, the protagonists kill some aliens by yanking out their hearts and/or twisting their heads right, then left, then right again. I'm not going to give away tbe ""surprise"" ending, but I'm sure you can guess."
1,Disappointing,"I had high expectations after reading all the other Amazon reviews, but I was a bit disappointed and found it relatively tough to get through this book.I didn't really enjoy the separate timelines and how slowly the story progressed. I also found that the author spent a lot of time describing the scenery and explaining random facts that didn't ultimately add to the story. The cursing and profanity were unnecessary and all seemed very forced.I got through to about 3/4 of the book and gave up. I've never had to force myself to finish a novel but I do blame myself for reading Name Of The Wind just previously."
2,not my cup of tea,"I guess the story line just wasn't my cup of tea, I had to put it down after 60 pages or so just couldn't get engaged.I bought this on the basis of all of the glowing reviews"
3,Not for me,"I am not vehemently opposed to this book; certainly many moments struck a key, but I believe this book just isn't for me. I saw George Martin's blurb, read the glowing reviews, and even heard people talk about the book in regular settings. I picked up the book as fast as I could.Unlike other reviews, I loved the first 100 pages. I just didn't find anything special about the tale. In some instances I feel like the description paragraphs were overdone, which is surprising for me to say since I fancy elaborate prose. There was also a few moments where the profanity appeared forced. I have no personal objections to obscene language in books, but unless the book is meant to be a jarring read (like Fight Club), it should come off natural - just like anything, really.Character sympathy extended to half of the crew. On a personal level I ""liked"" Bug, Jean, and the Priest more than I did Locke.I definitely think this was a good first effort, though. The cover art is beautiful as well."
4,Venice Underground,"If you are a child, poor and in the underclass in Camorr, there is not much you can do to change your circumstances. Well, unless you are damn good at lying, thieving and mummery. And Locke Lamora is very very good at all of them.Camorr, with a lot of parallels to Venice, is run by either gangs, or by the upper class, or perhaps by both, working in congress.Locke, orphaned and alone, is recruited into one notorius gang, but is so much trouble he's passed on to a somewhat more sophisticated level of thievery and cons. There, his exploits gain him some not necessarily great attention. He becomes ""The Thorn of Camorr and that's where things begin to go pear-shaped. Who is out to get him and his the rest of his gang, 'the Gentleman Bastards' and why?Good pacing, good writing and engaging characters you really want to root for. Some very surprising twists. Highly recommended."
1,Poorly written and uninteresting characters...,"After I got to the point where one character was pretending to strangle another character for about 5 pages where they kept jumping back and forth between the present and the past without giving much indication that they were doing so, I put the book down and have had no desire to pick it back up. It took me about 4 days to get 50 pages into this book. In comparison It took me about 5 days to completely finish ""The Name of the Wind (Kingkiller Chronicles, Day 1)"" and 7 days to finish ""The Wise Man's Fear: The Kingkiller Chronicle: Day Two (Kingkiller Chronicles)"". I haven't been this let down by a book since Gerorge rr Martin showed he can suck at writing as bad as any first time author with ""A Feast for Crows"" (another book I could not finish)."
2,Not a fantasy,"I suppose my idea of a fantasy is different than the modern day version--a crass, everyday term as every other word, depressing, and completely unscrupulous...if I wanted those things, I'd read the paper. When did we get so negative? Can't we have the hero anymore?"
1,Can't finish,"The story is very interesting but the way it is written really put me off. The constant flashbacks is annoying because it unnecessarily intrudes on the story telling. All the characters aren't very interesting either. After reading Death of a Necromancer (similar book about a genius thief in a world full of rich, corrupt nobles), this book pales in comparison. I don't recommend it to others."
3,Still looking,Boring in parts and I have to admit that I skipped parts of the book. Still looking for a really good Fanatasy read.
2,Rather bland,"I started this thinking this would be a grand fantasy read, but the fantasy elements in this one are rather light. That's okay, and I wouldn't have minded so much if the rest of the book made up for the fantasy-lite experiences. However, the book starts off rather slow. It's a long while before it picks up as the author lays out the elaborate ""scheme"" the characters are involved in. Those were some of the slowest parts. It did pick up in parts of the book and there were so geniune good moments, but in the balance of things, not enough. Also, I'm no prude. I swear myself on occassion, but the characters swear nearly every time they speak, high class, low class, middle class, they all do and for not reason. I swear when I'm mad or tense. The characters in this swear for no reason at all except that the author seems to think it's cool. On the plus, and the reason for 2 stars, is some of the action scenes were pretty good, but they were far apart and few."
2,disappointing,"This book probably deserves three stars, but I was so disappointed after having read so many glowing reviews that I can't help but give it a lower rating! The main character doesn't seem to have any substance at all. He's supposed to be extremely clever, witty, and street-smart, but he makes mistake after mistake in his adventures, getting his friends killed in the process. I found the one-liners to be inappropriate and annoying. The swearing doesn't bother me too much, I just didn't feel any respect or sympathy for the main character. It's not really the same type of literature, but you might try Robin Hobb's Farseer series if you're looking for something better."
2,Disappointing,"Impressed with the positive reviews this book received, I decided to give it a read, but finished feeling like I wasted my time. I'll skip discussing thing like technique, writing style, etc. and just cut to the chase - I didn't particularly like the story. There were some parts that I found entertaining, but another reviewer described it best as a ""confection"". It never felt like there were any teeth here, and in particular, I found Locke's character inconsistent with the stature attributed to him. Writing ""clever"" is very difficult, and the action in this book never seemed as clever as the character was supposed to be."
3,"A hearty ""meh""","Entertaining plot, reasonably amusing characters, but painfully cookie cutter - felt as if it was written using the character classes from a D&D; game: ""Hey, we've got a rogue, a wizard, a fighter, and a cleric! That's a great party!""Writing is decent but nothing special; a bit *too* clever at times, as other reviewers have pointed out but no jarringly awful prose. Comparisons to China Mieville are totally misguided: Mieville approaches writing as if he is trying to create great literature or at least transcend the bounds of genre fiction. Think more along the lines of Glen Cook's Garrett novels or Matthew Reilly's ""Scarecrow"" series, but I think Cook and Reilly take themselves less seriously.Would I recommend this book? Well, I gave it three stars...readable but not something particularly worth seeking out."
2,Disappointing,"Desperate to find something to read in between Hobb's, George R.R. Martin's, Guy Gavriel Kay's, C.S. Friedman's and Donaldson's latest, I chose this title primarily based on the overwhelmingly positive reviews. I've been reading fantasy for over 25 years and appreciate all the aspects of world building, so was considerably dismayed when I saw my very own American foul language peppered throughout the pages of this fantasy. And despite all the rave reviews, I would argue the plot plods, the characters are two dimensional and the ""twists and turns"" become annoyingly repetitive and predictable half way through the tome. I feel no pathos for the orphan who only finds purpose in life when he seeks revenge. To keep this review short and put it bluntly, this book bored me enough to write my second review ever."
5,Epic fantasy heist story.,"I should preface this by saying that I love con-man stories, and heist stories and the like. Harry Harrison's ""Slippery Jim"" DiGriz and Spider Robinson's ""Professor"" are two of my favorite characters in SF. On the fantasy side the list, I will very happily add Locke Lamora.This book is simply great fun. Don't look for deep soul searching or life-changing hipster-pretentious prose. What the book has is a fascinating world, and incredibly fun and audacious characters. It has its tragedies and heavy moments, but they're neither overly melodramatic or jarring to the plot. Locke's plans, if looked at objectively, might be a bit far-fetched, but the book pulls you along and draws you in so well that you won't mind straining your suspension-of-disbelief muscles a bit."
5,lives up to the hype,"this had my heart racing several times. action packed, interesting, and well written for sure. loved the characters, and the dialog is dead-on. scott lynch knows his world like the back of his hand, as any good author ought to. this was a welcome distraction from the post-Potter depression i went through when Deathly Hallows was released!read it, and enjoy it. i sure did. can't wait to read the next novel!"
5,"First, build a world. Then, save it.","I really enjoyed this book.If you're a fan of con men, swindlers, and heists, as well as spells and swordplay, you'll probably like this novel. I was surprised and happy with the amount of world-building that went on, until I discovered that this is to be the first of seven novels for the author. Scott Lynch never lets the action bog down in one place by alternating a chapter of story in the present with an interlude from the fictional past, where he weaves in clues that pay off later.I really don't have anything in particular that I disliked about the book, though the length may turn some people off."
5,Uh-May-Zing,"I was in need of a good adventure story with tales of intrigue and action. This book delivers in every way. It satisfies the little devil in all of us, yet bleeds of the honorable actions of an atypical anti-hero.The book moves fast, yet gives you pause for breath with frequent anecdotes (that form a completely relevant and interesting back story). It's told much like a supreme campfire story, but with the depth of something much, much more.Thoroughly recommended for anyone who loves action and doesn't mind intensity or some foul language."
4,Excellent First Try,"Scott Lynch does a wonderful job of creating a group of interesting and sympathetic characters to follow around his cityscape, which works as a nice alternative to the traditional high fantasy worlds common to the genre. The story can be gritty and brutal at times, which further defines the underdog role of the protagonists, who seem to maintain a roguish sense of common decency no matter the cost. The book has a few decent turns, and the plot doesn't always go as you might expect, even though the supporting characters and subplots can be a bit thin at times. Overall, it's a good read, and I can definitely see a bright future for Lynch. I look forward to the rest of the series."
4,So very awesome,"Couldn't put it down. Loved the characters, plot, and moral ambiguity. Its the sign of real talent when an author can make you sympathize with and even side with people whose actions you might normally question. Lots and lots of humor, fascinating atmosphere, and just the right amount of realism and unlikely lucky breaks/optimism. If you sometimes read for escapism check it out."
4,Lots of Fun,"I saw a bunch of recommendations for this book, but they were from people who had pretty bad taste. I tried it anyway, and I'm glad I did. It's not the greatest book in the history of the universe. It won't change your life or anything. It's just a load of fun. It has the obligatory surprises near the end. The main problem I had was that the villain's motivation was disconnected from the plot and characters that you cared about, so I didn't care about him at all. So the inevitable resolution for him didn't have much impact.And hey, I just bought the sequel."
5,An enjoyable read.,"This was a mixed bag of enjoyment. Some aspects of the storyline you can anticipate, the rest you think you can, then it changes. I really enjoyed this book. I'm still trying to figure out Locke, but that's a good thing for such a complex character. The villains where fantastic, I wanted to reach into the book and strangle them myself. The length of the book was perfect. Some readers of previous reviews found the flashbacks confusing, I found that they fit in perfectly and helped explain the story better as the book progressed. Scott Lynch also nails the details perfect, just enough to help the story along and building the world and characters, but not so much as to bore you. I would highly recommend this book to any of my friends."
4,Very Good Read,"I purchased this book a few days ago and read it over a weekend. I must say, the story kept me turning pages wanting to know what happened next. It had everything I expected - thievery, lying, violence, betrayal, etc. While the way the story is put together does take away somewhat from the actual excitement of the plot (with flashbacks every other chapter to the main characters childhood), it does offer the reader the chance to learn a little more about the characters, thus giving them a better understanding of why they act the way they do, why they're better at one thing than another, etc. So it's almost like putting together a puzzle on the characters while seeing how they plot, scheme, etc. Overall, I recommend it. It's an entertaining book, if nothing else."
5,heart racing joy,I sit in silent having just finished the book. It has taken me to a world that has lifted me from mere living to heart racing joy. I am in a state of joy for a book has again made me love the world. Thank you!
4,enjoyable,"I liked the story. The world was fasinating and the characters were funny and interesting. It seemed to be a book of flashbacks, which helped in the reading for the slow parts, but my only complaint is that the story dragged a bit here and there."
5,Smart and clever,"First thing that grabbed my attention was the superb writing style of the book. The dialog was spot on and I was quickly immersed in a well designed world. A great adventure, a nice tricky clever plot and fantastic characters with intelligence and believable core value systems. Enjoy!"
4,Almost Venice,Locke Lamora is a fantasy debut set in the sort of city that Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser would be happy to wander through. A dingy and corrupt fantastic Venice built on the ruins of alien magic.While some of the characters are underdeveloped our protagonist and his foe are worthy of note as are the laws of magic underlying the world.Good stuff!
4,Great First Novel,"""The Lies of Locke Lamora""-- the first novel by Scott Lynch-- is an excellent first novel and start to a series.Locke is a very enjoyable protagonist, and his capers-- whether monetary or 'vindicative'-- were thoroughly entertaining.Lynch lost his way, a bit, during the last third of the book, but recovered nicely at the end.It's not the best thing since sliced bread, but it is much better than the vast quantity of tripe in the Fantasy sphere.Give it a read, you won't be sorry."
2,Tedious,"I was prepared to like this book but couldn't get past the tedious and lengthy descriptions of the scenery, the clothing, the way of things, etc etc etc. The elaborate descriptiveness totally got in the way of the story. I skipped ahead a few times to see if it was possible to get by the tedium but finally gave up in frustration. I read for pleasure and there are too many good books out there to waste time on the hum drum."
5,Pleasure reading,Bought this for my son - he said it was very good & wants to read more by this author.
5,Crime Caper meets Alien Magic,"Wow! Lies of Locke Lamorra defies description, but it also defies you to put it down. This crime-caper of a novel set in a world once populated by aliens, devoid of most technology, with a bit of magic kept me enthralled from the start. Lamorra is a bit like Oliver Twist; they're both orphans who fall into service with mentors whose goal is to teach the orphans how to steal. The book threads around two central plot-lines: Lamorra's newest and boldest scam, and an attempted take-over in the city's underworld. The chapters are broken up with past vignettes that show how Lamorra and his crew came to act the way they do.This is an intelligent, clever, and at times funny book. It is always entertaining."
4,One of my favorite books,"It's been several months since I've read The Lies of Locke Lamora, but it remains one of my favorites still. Loads of action, great dialogue, very creative writing, and very humorous characters. It compares very much to a late medieval Ocean's Eleven. I enjoyed it thoroughly and would recommend it to anyone. The sequel is just as good, and I'm looking forward to reading the 3rd book in this series soon."
4,Worth a Try,"This is an interestingly conceived world with believable characters--thus the four stars--but I didn't finish the book, which is very unusual for me. I can't truly explain why, but I suspect that it was because all of the characters were so foreign to me, aptly realized or not. I never felt connected and thus was easily distracted by moving on to another book. Nevertheless, it is an exceptionally well written novel and you should see what you think for yourself."
3,"Too much pulp, Not enough juice","I enjoyed the last quarter of the book better than the first three quarters. The first half was a mix of back story and slow pace storyline. The back story could have been better had the author had some point to its vast detail but there wasn't. It even missed stuff like the love of Locke's life, Sabetha who is eluded to many times but you never actually see her ever. It lengthened the book but did nothing for the storyline. He didn't even seem to have fun with it. But the last quarter is where its most tense and moves fastest. For the last quarter I will buy the next one because I hope we got all the backstory done although I doubt it. He couldn't hold intensity in the book at all and it was a bit of a chore to read it until it got good. If you want a better book that will hold you through read Mistborn. Locke is a great character but the editing of scenes could have been much better."
3,Decent but overrated 2.25-2.5 stars,This book has recieved way too much hype and just isn't good enough to deserve it. The begining of the book was excellent but the story turned away from Locke's early time living under the cemetary much too quickly. Could have been much more and much better had it not tried so hard to be the Oceans 11 of fantasy and stuck to the Dickensian beginings of the character. I may or may not read book two but the reviews for that one are not very promising so not really sure.
2,so much potential,"This book had so much potential. It has an interesting culture, it has a few characters that could glow, and a plot that could go places with volition. It does none of those things.There are flashbacks galore, interludes a plenty, and language that is gaudy. There are no cases in this story where a character uses a small word where a large one, or several large ones can be used instead. Worse, it feels as if the author has tried to shove an extra-superduper-extraordinary line of description every eight or twelve pages. The language clunks. It tries to be lyrical, it tries so hard and it fails. On top of this _all_ the characters have the same fulsome vocabulary, which seems a bit off. Sure, the group the title character is a part of is explained well, and the nobles are too, but the rest of the thieves, cut throats and petty criminals?This book is what I imagine it would be like to watch The Nutcracker be performed in plate armor and clogs."
2,dislike switching time lines,"I liked the characters and I think the story line would have been good. I hate reading books where the authoir keeps switching between past, current and future. It gives too much away about the past, and just gets irritating. Just as you get engrossed in the current story you get whisked forward or back and lose the momentum. Scott Lynch does so much of this that for the third time in my life I abandoned a book half way through."
3,Well written but,"This book promises the scope and scale of an epic fantasy, but without the epic.It is about a human population in some distant realm. The characters are well drawn. There is suspense and good plotting, (although, it seemed to drag in places). Locke Lamore is an intriguing rogue, but never do we really see this character confront a really terrible, cataclysmic situation.The whole tension between Gentlemen Bastards (Lamore's group) and the lead up to the final fight left me wanting something more. Unfortunately, this book doesn't provide it."
4,The Thorn of Camorr,"The Lies of Locke Lamora is an excellent first novel by what appears to be an extremely promising new author. This book is probably the most entertaining read I have ever had. The characters are well fleshed out, the plot is interesting, and reading about uppity nobles (among others) being bilked out of money makes for interesting nights.From first to last, The Lies of Locke Lamora delivers on all the hype and will you keep you engrossed til you come out the other end ready to don a mask and thief a little on the side."
2,Just couldn't get into it,"I don't understand how this book received such stellar reviews. It is just plain boring from the very first word of the very first chapter. I tried, I really did but if you find yourself skipping entire paragraphs or pages from the fist chapter, well then you already know it sucks. Didn't care about the main character, didn't care about his crew, and ultimately never finished this book."
2,Just not worth the effort,"Mr. Lynch has some decent ideas but this book is a tough read. The story jumps around with very little transition and can be tough to follow. It is also filled with gratuitous vulgarity from curse words to obscene comments. I am not easily offended but the language shocks you away from the story. This book desperately needs an editor and a rewrite, until that happens don't waste your time."
3,Interesting read.,"This was a different from what I normaly read and that is more Tolkien like books. The Author writes about young men who are brought up to be thievs and con men in an world where magic exsits but not in an magic world. Not a book about big strong heroes, and magicians but more about a Dikcens kind of fantasy world. I found it a bit on the hard side to read for some reason or another. I fealt that I had to push my self through the book, even that I was a interesting book to read."
3,It was just okay...,"WOW! By reading all of these fabulous reviews I would have thought this was better than A Song of Ice and Fire by George Martin! Sorry, not even close. I certainly liked R. Scott Bakker's ""The Prince of Nothing"" better. I like Greg Keyes ""The Kingdoms of Thorn and Bone"" better. I like Paul Kemp's Erevis Cale series better. Finally, I am reading Acacia by David Anthony Durham and it's better.Maybe I am just not too huge a fan of an ""Oliver Twist"" tale. Still, it was good enough for me to continue the series. I am just in disbelief by how many ""glowing"" reviews this book has recieved."
5,Hands down the second best fantasy novel I've ever read,"After ""Lord of the Rings"", this has definitely got to be my favorite fantasy novel of all time. I was worried in the beginning as it started a bit slow and was too reminiscent of ""Oliver Twist"" with the hordes of beggar children working for the old thief, but that introductory minutia was easily overlooked once the proper plot started up, and oh what a thing of joy it was. I won't spoil any details, but really the main thing I love in ANY book is an intelligent main character and we have that in spades with Locke Lamora. Unlike other books who profess to have intelligent characters, I was rarely if ever able to outguess Locke Lamora, but his actions fit so neatly into the overall scheme he worked on that it was just a beautiful thing and a wonder to behold.The second book is almost as good as the first, and I can only hope that more will follow as soon as possible."
5,Now this is why I read...,"What a wonderful book. Intelligent. Rich. Funny. Complex. And I couldn't put it down. This is the sort of rich fantasy George R. R. Martin writes. And yet Lynch's book is radically different; his world is smaller, simpler, more rooted in humanity. I picked this up on a whim. ($6.99??? Of course it's worth it!) I was moved by the critic's praise (including Martin's). And they were right on. Lynch IS A MAJOR NEW TALENT. I can't wait for the next book in what I hope will be a long, successful series."
4,Great read but slow beginning,"This has been one of the best books I've read in the last 6 months, rivaled by Name of the Wind. It took me about 6 months to read this book because the plot was painfully slow in the beginning.It does a good job creating the history and setting the stage for character development and for the plot to unfold, but when I hit a third of the book and still nothing has happened, I let it sit on the shelf for a few months. I'm not the most patient reader.However, once I got past that slow third of the book, the plot all of a sudden picked up. There were layers upon layers of intrigue, and just as I thought I'd figured out the evil scheme, something else didn't fit. It was for sure a roller coaster to the end. I can't wait to read the second book! I heard the second book's not as good, but I'll let you know when I read it."
5,What a treasure to stumble upon!!,"Why is this novel not being lauded more?! This book is fantastic and the story is entrancing. I read TONS of books and this one took me by surprise. There are rich and expansive characters, the city is a character unto itself and the staggered timeline makes for a great read. Anyone who is on the fence should just go for it and buy this book, buy this kindle or even download the audio version (which is well done by Michael Page)."
4,"good, but not quite a 5 star book","The book is good. It is a fantasy book set in a mainly medeival world of nobles, priests, pirates, wizards (Bondsmages in this world), and thieves. Speaking of thieves, the main characters ARE thieves. The thing that kept me from giving it 5 stars is the ending. The main character has mainly been outwitting, not oufighting, his opponents. His strategy at the end was none too bright and not in character."
3,Definitely worthwhile,"Despite being produced in 1986, most of the content remains up-to-date, except that the then population of 6.5 million is now 8.5 million. Cousteau gets a lot of good information into 48 minutes of viewing, though I might have wished for less scuba-diving (much time is spent establishing the fact that surprisingly few fish are to be found among the coral-rich shores) and more about Port-au-Prince. The film does incorporate some fundamental Haitian history, but makes little to no mention of Haiti's political unrest. As noted by previous reviewer, viewer discretion is certainly advised through a 5-or-so minute segment featuring a rather explicit female fertility rite within a ceremonial mudhole, as well as other brief encounters of female frontal nudity. Not available in DVD, to my knowledge."
3,"comfortable, nice appearance, narrow fit","This model have a nice appearance, sole is really comfortable it feels like walking over cushions. Fit is considerably narrow so be careful if you have wide feet,if so, you will have a hard time until the shoes loose. Materials seems to have hight quality, as well as manufacturing. If they were wider, they would be perfect."
1,"Advocacy, Not History","I ""lived"" through much of the period and conditions of her subject. I was stationed in Trieste during the period 1946-1947 with the U.S. Army. I am aware of the strife which she tends to view from only one side, i.e.,the Communist Jugoslav faction. One only has to compare her rejection of the known facts of the ""Forty Days"" (the period from May 1, 1945 to June 12, 1945 when the Jugoslav Army and the Jugoslav OZNA controlled the city) as she passes off Basovizza (site of mass burials of Italians) as trivial!Ms Sluga is an advocate, not an historian!"
4,Greatest Karate Fighter of All Time: Joe Lewis,"Joe Lewis and Dr. Jerry Beasley provide insight to Joe's American Karate System, starting with Joe's youth to his USMC days to his training with Bruce Lee and finally on to Joe's own personal system. The writing is good although Paladin Press could have done a better job with the photos. (I point out that if you buy such a book strickly for the photos you bought it for the wrong reason.) I have known Joe Lewis personally for many years and have attended his Black Belt Conferences; I have observed him up close on many occasion and I still find this book is well worth the cost. I recommend any books written by Joe Lewis and/or Dr. Jerry Beasley; you can always pickup pointers from any of their writings."
2,Combat Wrestling Forever,"The Book is way too short and he never talks about catch-as-catch-can-wrestling. Joe Lewis was a good fighter in his day.....as far as karate types go but equip wrestlers with submission holds and the karate types just fall by the way-side. Again, he never talks about wrestling at all!"
1,MISLEADING,THE SONGS ON THE WEB SITE WERE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FROM THE SONGS ON THE CD I RECEIVED. THE CD COVER WAS THE SAME AS WEB SITE.
2,Adorable but no way are they comfortable,"These are the cutest shoes, but they are way too uncomfortable. The top of the shoe rubs up against my foot as I walk and left a brush burn. What is the point of making shoes so totally adorable and so unwearable?"
5,Black Lives,"""Diaries"" beautifully exemplifies the genre of fictional memoir. It gives readers a snapshot of black cultural perspectives in down-to-earth, yet psychologically rich contexts. These contexts are everyday lives of real people exploring their humanity, their stories are fresh and engaging, poignant and bittersweet yet unsparingly unsentimental. This often neglected area of fiction -- black men's subjective realities -- is powerfully and gracefully dealt with in this first work by Tony Brooks."
5,good,I bought these to replace the ones for bottles I've had in storage for a few years. Seem to work great.
3,A Guilty Pleasure,"Lacan is not easy to follow, by intent, yet the elegance of his thought processes bring real depth to psychoanalysis and the limitations of language in expressing our evolutionary struggles to identify the conflict between our internal processes and the world outside. Multiple rereadings will bring clarity. I keep a copy in my office for reference."
4,good but not a classic,"For my child who loves stories, I like to give nice books that are both picture books and that have long-ish stories to read out loud. This book fit the bill. The stories are imaginative and the illustrations in this volume are pretty nice. Overall it is a nice package and my child was excited enough about the gift to read through all the stories once. But it doesn't seem that it is going to have the same staying power as other previous choices like ""D'Aulaires Norse Myths"" or a nice volume of tales from the Arabian Nights. It's just not in the same league."
2,Not for beginers,"The book has some very interesting plans and good photos for those how like to work with wood and make toys for children and as keepsakes.However this is not for the begining wood worker. The plans were not proofed before printing, there are many mesurmetments missing or do not agree with parts list. Unless the part is drawn to scale you will need to make it to fit on your own.Having a complete wood shop, I found that I had to use many tools that were not listed as needed in the book. In some cases I needed to improvise, such as using my drill press as a vertical lathe. Just watch the grain paterns as shown and you will be able to produce somthing to be proud of.To date I have made the Pick Up (29 Ford), Peterbilt Tractor with box trailer and Buick Sedan. From the expereance I gained it should make it possable to complete the projets pictured but not show in detail."
2,Junk,"I thought I would save a few dollars and buy a cheap handle since I'm living in a rented apartment. That was a bad choice. The nut is plastic and wouldn't hold in place. The handle wouldn't lock in tight and would commonly slip out. I tried to make it work, but everything failed. It just wouldn't hold together long enough. After giving up on this I bought the Danco 89450A. It costs a bit more but it's built much better. It assembled easily and works perfectly. I would advise you not to waste your money on this product."
4,Very Solid,"Much like the previous Anthems of Rebellion, Arch Enemy delivers a solid yet somewhat forgettable album. With the introduction of Angela on Wages of Sin, the band delivered a really powerful outing, creating an album with many must-hear tracks. Here, you get a very solid album top-to-bottom, but few of the tracks have that ""special"" feel to them.Nemesis was the obvious choice for a single, and it does stand out among the rest of the album. What the next single will be is beyond me...nothing is screaming for that need. My Apocolypse is probably the next best offering off the CD, and the intro track is pretty sweet as well. But everything else just kinda blends together.The album is by no means bad. It rocks. But Arch Enemy can and has done better."
2,Its over,"I will at least show my true colors and admit I think they have gone downhill since the addition of Angela at vocals. I think musically they have lost their spark and I think her vocals are overrated by a plethora of googly-eyed male teens. The fact of the matter is there really is not a lot of substance to this album. ""Machtkampf"" and ""Nemesis"" are among the few songs that have grabbed my attention. ""Hybrids of Steel"" is actually a pretty engaging instrumental that really doesn't sound like anything else on here. This was not enough for me though, and I think it important for potential Arch Enemy fans to know that this album does not touch the greatness of ""Burning Bridges""."
3,Not really that great,"The new arch enemy just doesn't seem that good. There is alot of recycled uninspired repitive riffs that seem like they just lost there passion for it all after the 3rd song or so. The vocals actually are not that bad, angela really does give her all on most songs, the drumming as usual is excellent, and the production job first rate. All in all i'm just not into arch enemy but i decided to give it a try at least."
2,Angela sucks.,"The band continues to kick butt severly but ANgela needs to get booted , bring back johan. THe swedish broad is lame as hell. Good music ,bad singer. Ditch the wench, she ruins a great band."
5,The best sounding album in Arch Enemy's career so far! BUY IT NOW!,"Doomsday Machine is the best sounding album in Arch Enemy's career so far.Doomsday Machine has more of a ""shredder's metal album"" image compared to Arch Enemy's previous works. Good work, Michael! (and Chris...)Featuring: Gus G (Firewind/Nightrage/Mystic propechy, ex-Dream Evil) as guest solo on Taking Back My SoulNemesis is an awesome song! So aggresive!!!Angela Gossow just get better! Go girl! ;)If you love Marty Friedman (Megadeth), Fear Factory, Uli Jon Roth, you will love this album too!!Masterpiece of Arch Enemy!WHAT MORE DO YOU WANT FROM A METAL ALBUM? BUY IT NOW!!!!"
2,A turn for the worse,"This album is not a complete loss, it just sucks compared to their prior releases.I thought Wages of Sin was an awesome album, I got the privaledge to see them live along with Bloodgasm, Lugosis Needle, Nile, Vader, Origin, and Hate Eternal. I like Angela, she's a talented metal vocalist, so I don't put all the blame on her, even though I think that the albums following Wages of Sin have been lame.I could only listen to this album twice, and the second time I listened to it, it was hard to imagine that Arch Enemy of all bands are making this transition. Now, it is a chore to sit through most of the songs on this CD.Arch Enemy kicks ass, but don't get 'this' album. Get 'Black Earth' or 'Stigmatta' for Arch Enemy at their finest."
3,3 for Michael Amott....,"I've never listened to Archenemy until this album - and when I heard the first track - a musical intro - I had big expectations. The legacy of Carcass continues, the greatest grind/death band ever - and Michael shows his talent on this album as do the others. The music is tight, real tight. So why three stars? I just cannot get my head around this death metal chicky vocalist Ange Gosset. She just affirms to me why chicks should not attempt the death metal grunt. It doesn't blend in with the music like other vocalists (thinking Nile - or even the LEGENDARY CARCASS) it hangs over the tight music with an uncomfortable rawness and gets in the way of the ripping tunes. I'm all for girls signing in bands, but this one doesn't pull it off in my books. In fact I'd rather her try to sing in the vein of Glen Danzig or something...Dissapointing....."
5,a masterpiece,"This is one of the best album of Arch Enemy.Seriously it kicks ass.Here's my opinion about the songs:1. Enter The Machine(15/10):fu***cking awesome intro.one of the best instrumental of all times2. Taking Back My Soul(13/10):one of my favourites.It's heavy,full of solos and has a catchy chorus3. Nemesis(13/10):it has been selected for a video.no comment4. My Apocalypse(10/10):classic Arch Enemy song5. Carry The Cross(11/10):slow and catchy6. I Am Legend/Out For Blood(13/10):personal favourite.An epic song7. Skeleton Dance(9/10):good song but not one of my favourite8. Hybrids Of Steel(9/10):this is where it gets experimental.Another instrumental it takes many listens to fully understand it9. Mechanic God Creation(8/10):I can't say that I like this song as much but that doesn't mean that it isn't good10. Machtkampf(11/10):truly a good song11. Slaves Of Yesterday(9/10):not something you would think as a closer.It could have been betterBUY IT NOW.It's worth it,believe me."
4,Great inspiring Death Metal,"Arch Enemy is fast becoming one of my favorites of this genre, Doomsday Machine kicks onto high gear with incredible music and vocals. It took awhile to get into them but sure worth it. Going to get more from this talented band in the future(you should too)!"
4,"overall, an excellent album; deserved far more air play","Unfortunate that this band did not receive more U.S. exposure. It's classic rock at its best. It is well written, well orchestrated, and excellent cruising music. The louder, the better."
4,"Better Than ""The Best Of""","Excellent debut album. While Sniff & The Tears might seem like mainstream pop in the 21st century, this group was refreshingly offbeat for 1978.The only other Sniff album I can compare this to is their ""Best Of"" compilation. ""Fickle Heart"" is a much better album to go with as it has a diverse and high-quality selection of tunes. The lyrics may not always be solid, but the music is top rate.If you've never heard Sniff and their tune ""Driver's Seat,"" take a chance on this album. IT's worth the $$$!"
3,Night Driving,"The Band's first album featured their only hit, the catchy ""Drivers Seat"", destined to haunt those who travel the quiet interstates out west at night. The album is otherwise listenable in a similar mode."
2,Mildly enjoyable with a few good songs,"Enjoyed the first song ""Drivers Seat"" very much that is the reason for purchasing this cd. It took a little while but listening to this cd over and over a few times it became much more enjoyable."
3,Much ado about.....nothing?!,"A good filler, Reflections in a Golden Eye was kinda dissappointing to me. Though I liked McCullers' writing style the book just sort of ended without the story really coming together. I loved that she allows the reader to really get to know the characters, their past and present, but at closing I was left going ""huh?"". One minute you're riding along enjoying the scenery and the next minute you're the last man standing. At least it was short. I'll read more of McCullers works because I enjoyed her style, but if I could I would give this book 2 1/2 stars instead of 3. Maybe next time?"
5,Definite insight in twisted minds,"Reflections in a Golden Eye was the second story I've read by Carson McCullers, the first was Ballad of a Sad Cafe which I didn't have much use for. Reflections.. on the other hand hit the right mark for me. I find it one of the most fitting books on the subject of human motivation. The story is really insightful on what goes in the psyche of the caracters. Besides that I really felt for the caracters which is always a good measurement for a good novel. A must read."
4,a cold-blooded and skillful narrative,"All the characters in the book were put under scrutiny by the writer, who observes his fiction like a hidden eye. I now wish to see the film, because this kind of a story (one that scalps the souls of the protagonists) is hard to transfer to screen."
4,LIKE A HOT KNIFE THROUGH BUTTER.,"This book was written in 1941, and deals with homosexuality as well as infidelity in the military. Now being a former Marine and I know what that is like. That alone was enough to make me read it, and I was suprised as to how tastfully it was done. I loved the characters McCullers created and how she was short and to the point with there feelings. A quick read and a ...honest one at that. Very honest about gay supressed passions. I recommend it."
3,Not bad except....,"These Ships of the Line series have been top heavy with TNG 1701-D. Only one NX class ship and a few -1701. A great opportunity was missed here to drive more interest in Star Trek during these ""dry"" years."
1,Why didn't I read the reviews first?,"Pretty pictures, but useless as a calendar. As other reviews have stated, the calendar is not laid out in a normal (useful) fashion, so good luck using it to plan anything."
2,Startrek Calendar,"The photos on this calendar are very interesting, but the numbers are small & difficult to see from any distance, plus they are not separated by weeks. I found this very disappointing & would not consider purchasing another calendar like this."
2,Beautiful but Impractical,"I cannot complain about the artwork in this calendar. It's inspirational. But the matter transport stream was obviously distorted on the way to the publisher. This calendar must be hung *SIDEWAYS* on the wall.It is the fault of the publisher and/or Amazon for not clarifying this. Also, I have to ""ditto"" all the reviewers who complained about no space to write on it.PROS: Trek art nicely done.CONS: Must be hung sideways on the wall (widthwise / landscape). No place to scribble on the dates (although this is not entirely bad).I wish I'd gotten the desk calendar - at least I could have made room for that."
1,What a Rip Off!,"Previous Ships of the Line calendars always featured art work from all five Star Trek series. This calendar only has art work from the original (Captain Kirk) series.The art work itself is significantly inferior to that of previous calendars and the ideas behind the pictures show no imagination, no indication that the artists tried to take any risks, no sign that anyone tried to illustrate the Star Trek universe in a different way. If you want an example of what I am going on about get your hands on a copy of the Ships of the Line 2002 calendar done by Mojo Lebowitz and Robert Bonchune - superb. The images themselves looked like they were knocked up on a home PC - no sense of depth or scale.If the original series of Star Trek is your bag then this calendar might be of interest you. For everyone else keep your money in your pocket."
3,Where's the rest of the Fleet?,"This is such a good calender, If you are dwelling in TOS.I am However like MOST Star Trek Fans are Fans of all the Star Trek Series TNG, DS9, VGR, ENT.So why isn't there ships from the other series. If you are going to monopolize TOS to only one calender this year, you could at least have another set of calenders with the other series. This (2006) is going to be a very very long year."
2,Save you money,Previous calendars were dramatic and creative but not this time around - it seems they were just interested in getting it out for print. It is solely from the origial series and I wonder why this is as it will limit the appeal to customers from all the other incarnations of Star Trek. Why don't they open it up to the fans to create their own images and have a book published (which they were originally planning)- it would be much more interesting and would spark the imagination of viewers just like the many generations of star trek.
3,"More or less the same, but still good looking","I agree with earlier posts that the artists creativity is getting repetitive, but to knock on it vs. the book is a little backwards. The book is a compendium of the calendar images and this year's calendar art was decided before the book was published. Personally, I HATED the book after having the calendars. The images were just too darn small.Complaining about the note space is a little off, too. No one ever said you had to be able to take notes on a calendar to find it useful. A calendar tells you the dates, and this one does that. One year in this series they did try and do a ""traditional vertical calendar with space for notes"" and it was an extremely unpopular decision."
3,Not as good as last year!,"I was a bit disappointed with the new 2010 Ships of the Line Calendar. While the pictures are nice, there are too many images of the 1701A and no images of Voyager. I hope next years is better."
1,Not useful as a calendar,"Whoa, I was extremely disappointed in this ""calendar""... The pictures are fabulous, no arguing that, but the ""calendar"" function is completely unusable. First off, the calendar opens sideways, so you need 2 hooks to hang it and it will take up more horizontal space than you may have planned for. That's strange, but not an insurmountable issue. The main problem is that the ""calendar"" printed on each page is not a standard Sunday-Saturday calendar format. The months are displayed starting at the first day of the month, sometimes in only 2 lines, not the standard 2 week format. For example, if the first day of the month is a Tuesday, the calendar starts with Tuesday and may have 2 weeks worth of dates printed on 2 lines, instead of 4. This is not useful as a calendar. Maybe I missed all these details in the description, I don't know, but thought I'd warn others before they bought this. I am SO disappointed."
3,This is NOT a calendar for noting things on.,"I wanted a new calendar for my wall on which I could write in things like doctor appointments and friends and relatives birthdays and such. There is absolutely NO room on this calendar for such! You see the calendar dates, but it's printed over the image on the page down in a corner.The images are beautiful, but when I buy a wall calendar, I *want* to be able to both look at the imagery *AND* actually USE the calendar!"
4,Gorgeous...,"Let me preface this by saying that I'm TOS/TMP/TWOK-era fan, far more than for any of the other eras (though they were, for the most part, quite fun). I love seeing the TOS-era stuff... which people tend to dismiss as ""cheesy"" (without any real basis other than ""it was made in the 60s so it has to be cardboard and strings""... which, of course, is utter nonsense!) done with ""let's make it real"" sensibilities. The cover of this calendar is a masterful example of this practice... and there are multiple other images in this (and its predecessors) which I absolutely LOVE looking at! I also enjoy the other stuff... the only Trek designs I've ever actually disliked are the Voyager and the ST-2009 ""Enterprise redesign"" (which, thankfully, is not to be found in this work!).If you love the ships of Star Trek... you can't go wrong with this."
5,Great art work,"I enjoy the ships of the line calendars. But this was a bit of a dissappointment because it has to be hung on the wall horizontally, which is stupid for a callendar. Once you get passed that, and putting another hole in your wall to hang it, it is not a bad callendar to look at. Word of advice to callendar makers...they can look really good while being practical. Stop the horizontal stuff."
3,This year's review,"The 2006 Star Trek Ships of the Line Calendar has more beautiful renderings than any previous Ships of the Line Calendar! If you are a fan of the Original Series, this is the one for you!The good = Not one rendering dedicated to Star Trek: Enterprise or Voyager! Yay!The bad= Not one rendering dedicated to The Next Generation or Deep Space Nine! Boo!All kidding aside, the fact that we did not get adequate representation for the other Treks (or even the movies) is the only thing keeping me from giving it 5 stars!"
3,if only this was billed as an art book...,"I just got this calendar out of the box this morning. If you're the kind of person who jots things down for certain days, do NOT get this. The days are not on any kind of grid, the dates are just printed on the art work. This is useful (I guess) if you just want to know what day of the week a certain date falls on. For my purposes, this calendar is virtually useless."
3,Beautiful Artwork - Lousy Calendar,"The artwork in this calendar is beautiful! I much prefer the computer-rendered artwork over the painted artwork, but they are all wonderful. My favorite is actually the picture on the cover. That one actually looks like it could be a photograph.I have a beef with this calendar (and all recent Ships of the Line calendars) however: This is really useless as a calendar. Be aware, this ""calendar"" exists only for the artwork. The dates themselves are a minor afterthought and aren't even arranged correctly to be understandable by anyone. I long for the old Ships of the Line calendar that actually was a calendar: artwork on top and usable grid on the bottom.It gets five stars from me for the artwork. It gets 1 star for the lousy calendar. Average them out and you get the three star ranking."
2,Ships of the Line:2009 Wall Calendar,The images for the calendar are great but the double width makes it difficult to hang. It also posts unusual grids for each month which makes the days of the week difficult to read at a glance.
1,This calendar made me angry- DO NOT BUY HERES WHY,"Every calendar I've seen has been either desktop with rip to remove pages or they'e been wall calendars which flip up.This calendar opened side to side requiring 2 nails to hold it on the wall. Its a very wide calendar and takes up a LOT of wall space.Sure, the pic's are nice- but not mural sized for an apartment!!Suggest do not buy due to size."
3,This calendar is ok,The 2010 calendar is ok. I wish it had more pictures on other alien and Federation ships.
4,More Poster than Calendar,"If you were looking for a calendar with lots of white space and big square boxes, this is not it. This is a poster book with a small view of the current month in the upper right hand corner of it. All of the pics are awesome though, so it's a nice decoration for the home office, or, the real office if you're not a closet Trekkie like me!"
2,"Interesting Pictures, but bad calendar","There are 8 columns for days in the calendar, which makes it extremely confusing to figure out which dates correspond to which days. Also the print of the dates is extremely small so you can't make notes. Since the purpose of a calendar is primarily for this things this is a horrible calendar in my opinion."
2,Ships of the Line 2007 Wall Calendar,"I was seriously disappointed that there was no ST: Enterprise calendar this year, but this one is a fair substitute. Problem is, I haven't found a place to hang it up yet. Its the 'wrong way' to fit in the place where I have always hung my calendars. And, there isn't a place to write your important data on the calendar. Appointments, notes, and reminders... etc. However the ship pictures are incredible and wonderfully detailed. I'll save it for sure, as a Star Trek memento. But as a functional calendar it leaves much to be desired."
1,"Don't even think about buying this ""calendar.""","I bought this product with the idea of purchasing a calendar. This is no calendar. The photos take up the full length of a page, while the days of each month are relegated to three inches in the bottom right hand corner. I returned the product."
4,Husband Loves His Star Trek,I was happy to see that they had a calendar of just ships. My husband is into all that kind of Star Trek stuff. So this made for a perfect gift.
4,Good product - but made in China,"Thought I was gettting a US made product as was more expensive than most - but, alas, not what it appeared to be."
4,The Cutting Edge,"I've tried several grapefruit knives over the years, but this one does what it's supposed to do--cut down to the rind to allow each section to be easily separated and removed.As a left-hander, I'm also glad it cuts sufficiently because too many cutlery products aren't made properly for left-handed use."
3,Collector and Fan Review,"I own several other model planes from this brand and this is the one that did not live up to expectations. It looked amazing in the pictures here, but the bad part is that the wings do not move, so that was a big negative against it.I'd buy other models from this brand before this one. If you are a big F14 fan you are probably better off buying one that opens the wings. But for the price its about as good as it gets."
5,Love these stories,"I snap these books up when I can. In some ways the writing is very much of its time - but that in itself is interesting to me. This story like the others of this author is pretty fast-paced, good characters and well written. Kind of 'boy's own' adventure meets with a less verbose Conan Doyle."
3,Fifteen Yard Penalty for Inaccurate Details,"I grew up with Army football from 1944 to 1946. I have a library of original highlight films detailing the plays, statistics and major games played by Blanchard and Davis. For anyone who knows Army football, the research, scripting and editing in this film are grossly innacurate. There's no excuse for it in a Hollywood budgetted film. For example the play-by-play announcers describe plays that never happened in the games that are on the screen, ie., Doc Blanchard returning a kickoff 96 yards against Notre Dame. He did that against Columbia, but it was announced as a game against Notre Dame. This type of free-form scripting/editing happens throughout the film. It cheapens what should have been a truly representative movie about two great American athletes. On the positive side, it's always great to see Blanchard and Davis in action. I recommend it to those viewers who have never heard of these two extraordinary football players."
5,"A world that never existed, or did it or should it have?","Ben Katchor's magical, sketchily precise illustrations lead us through a grey other world where people face problems none of us will ever know. Or fathom. But who cares! Every step of the way is uniquely Katchor's, grounded in a strange logic that seems to make perfectly good sense... at least to his characters. A wealth of invention infuses every page, conjuring exotic maladies, bizarre business enterprises and wierd obsessions."
4,A Celebration of Quality Choral Hymns,"In a world of pop Christian music, its wonderful to find quality choral recordings of current and classic hymns of faith such as this. The traditional Christiansen-sterile sound has been broken in the new St. Olaf generation without any sacrifice of quality. The ethnic and historic variety add real celebration and a choral treat! John Ferguson and company know hymns, know quality arrangements, and of course, quality performance."
4,Lotus Guide Review by Rahasya Poe,"Earth under Fire: Humanity's Survival of the Ice AgeBy Paul A. LaViolette, PhDISBN: 1-59143-052-6 (Inner Traditions, 2005)It's not a matter of ""if""; it's a matter of ""when"" will we go through the next cataclysmic upheaval on Earth. Putting aside the debate of whether or not it's manmade or natural, with the mounting information pointing to the fact that Earth is rapidly approaching a major shift, we would do well to learn from our ancestors, who recorded through myths and monuments the destructive forces that nature can and has unleashed in our past. A compilation of well-documented science, from ice cores and astronomical evidence, to indigenous myths of when their ancestors faced extinction, could possibly make this information crucial for our own survival.Rahasya Poe, Lotus Guide magazine [...]"
5,A Wealth of Information about past and future Catastrophies,"This book is a detailed read, but well worth it. I recommend this book even though I do not agree with every point made in the book, as he sees all past evidence as pointing to his theory, whereas sometimes it is clear that other things are being referred to, such as asteroid impact.Nevertheless it contains a huge quantity of information that will benefit anyone doing research in the subject of catastrophism, or the destruction of ancient civilizations. It even has information relevant to the future. Has numerous end notes and bibliography."
2,Funky Construction,"I must say, for such a ...piece of equipment, this device is not made very well. Before I purchased the Compaq, I owned a Palm V. Whereas the Palm never failed me, in less than a year of ownership, the Compaq has developed several problems:* My Compaq has fried its memory repeatedly* The stylus no longer clicks into place, that mechanism has apparently broken.* The silver coating is coming upThe color screen is nice, but doesn't make up for the headache or the cost. I wish I'd just purchased another Palm V when my last one was stolen."
4,Worked for me....,"My Compaq Ipaq has always worked for me. Mine was actually from my grandfather, he won it. It's got very little memory, 16 MB, but it has a slot for an SD card. Overall, I like the system. All the parts are working fine now after a few years. The battery life is somewhere around five hours. I like the size, but the problem is you can't carry it around with much memory unless you use the expanison (memory card) pack, which makes it bulky and heavy. However, it has good graphics (it supports lots of free or shareware games), can be used as an mp3 player, typewriter/laptop, and is good for just a calendar or memo organizer. I think it's a good buy."
4,Can't play on newer computers,"First, the music is awesome. I spent 2 years looking for this remix version with the wilder guitar parts on Baby did a bad bad thing..here it is. And a very cool acoustic version I'd never heard before. More than worth it. Unfortunately these are old 90's Quicktime Enhanced Cds which means it won't play on my windows7 machine...the disk is not even recongnized. Plays in my cd player which sucks because I never listen to cds any more, it's pretty much just my computer when I get to listen to music. So needless to say I need to find some kind of 1/8"" end cable to plug the headphones out of my cd player into my computer to try to re-record this cd to my computer library. Apple sucks. Which is why I only gave it 4 stars."
1,Do not buy this product,"This is the worst product I've encountered for the computer. Not only was it a difficult installation, but the tech support disagreed with each other on various calls, although they were nice. It took 8 calls before they informed me that this product does not work with Toshiba Satellite laptops. Yes, it does not work with my laptop and they don't know why nor do they state so in the manual (let alone on the box). I took it back and bought a Siemens Speedstream and had it up and running in 30 minutes."
3,A good introduction,"This is mostly a list of why people can't create. The book provides few techniques to boost creativity. However, the blocking mechanisms are clearly explained. Identifying the problems is the path to a solution....I will look around to find books that describe some methodology to create more effectively."
2,"More blocks, less busting","If you're interested in learning about problems people encounter that keep them from being as creative as they might be, this book is for you. If you are looking for ways to overcome these problems and to be more creative yourself, look elsewhere."
2,Lackluster,"There really isn't very much to this book. The majority of its bulk is taken up describing various blocks people have which inhibit creativity -- cultural, societal, emotional, and so on. The author never describes how one can work past these blocks. Later on he points out that people have five senses and we should try to use all five of them when solving problems. All in all hardly groundbreaking stuff. In the end his message seems to be: you have to exercise your imagination if you want to be more creative but he doesn't include enough exercises to do that with this book. I would suggest you look elsewhere if you are seriously interested in being more creative."
3,Quite enjoyable,"Though its kind of weird to ""train"" your brain to think differently, I enjoyed reading it. Loved the examples and exercises as also the the letter to the author from Becky Buechel - completely cracked up when I read that. ^_^All in all, a good read. Different, but good."
4,"Helpful, but not systematic","The book provided some ideas for opening up new neuralpathways that could increase creativity, but didn't describea systematic method for doing so."
4,Good perfume,"Smells really nice... One small problem, I went to a store and picked one up, had a different color than the one I bought from here (online). Both have similar scents and are great though!"
1,Techno ...,Before you think of purchasing this CD realize one thing. This is not Praying Mantis the British hard rock outfit but a German Techno outfit with the same name. It should have been mentioned because people like myself who like Praying Mantis are going to buy this unaware they are going to get a load of techno ....I do not like techno so I cannot give this any stars. What annoys me is that Amazon would not file this CD as Praying Mantis - German Techno ... not the great hard rock band of the same name.Do not be fooled like me.
2,iteration reiteration,"back and forth and back and forth. im happy. im sad. happy. sad. love him. dont love him. love him. dont blah. blah blah. we're poor. we're not poor. we're poor.a series of a series of a series of deus ex machinas.malamud's writing style is easy to slip into, and the story is addictive yet annoying (any pulp novel can be addictive).spoilerhe rapes her and and spies on her undressing and it's ok! (no, don't try to sell me any of that oh the author's not giving this his approval, no no no. when there is nothing to contradict something, it's the same as saying it's ok. the same as if someone writes a book where everyone is racist and there is nothing in the book to say that being racist is bad. in this book there is nothing to say that raping someone is bad and that irks me.)"
4,"Beautiful, Wonderful, Powerful",This is a beautiful little book -- easily one of the most underrated American classic. Malamud traces the immigrant's experience so well that you hate to leave the world he illuminates.
3,"Good book, but not great","This book was ok once you get through the beginning, which is very slow. I was also required to read it, so anyone who is reading this review and is also required is probably already thinking that the book is going to be bad, but believe me, once you get into the middle, you want to read more"
4,intriguing story but a bit too melodramatic,"'The Assistant' is clearly an interesting read. Set in 1950s New York City, a young gentile enters the lives of elder Jewish shopkeepers and their daughter. The gentile is a tormented soul with questionable morals. The shopkeepers distrust him, especially around their daughter. But this gentile ultimately affects their lives in profound and everlasting ways. Certainly 'The Assistant' is rich in dialog, characterizations and in capturing anti-semetic feelings during that era. However the author seemed to have overreached in making the ending to the story to be something profound, almost of biblical proportions. For me it was too contrived. But this was only a slight distraction from an otherwise pleasant reading experience.Bottom line: an interesting and moving drama that teeters on melodrama. Strongly recommended nonetheless."
4,great,"great read, great character development. Got me started reading the rest of his books. I would definitely recommend to anyone."
1,Hype,"What a racket these 2 women have. They send out letters of recipe request to restaurants, and authors, put these recipes in their books and reap all the rewards. The chefs, cooks, and cookbook authors used in the book get absolutely nothing for their contributions."
3,A bit of a reach,"I am a Michael Ruhlman fan and have read all his books. I was eager for this one, and felt disappointed that the first half of the book included ""catch up"" explanatory information covering his other books. I felt like I was plow ing through repeated information that was in both Making of a Chef and Soul of a Chef. Once he got past laying the framework, the flow was there. It was interesting to see how fame extracts its price on Thomas Keller, and how much of an impact the restaurant competition has all the way down the chain with increasing our expectations of what we will eat and what we will pay for."
4,Good Foodie Book,"I'm a huge Michael Ruhlman fan, from his cookbook work to his Making of a Chef story of studying at the Culinary Institute. The Reach of a Chef certainly is not his best work; it seems to lack a clearly defined story so it becomes a bit overly expansive. But if you are a foodie and a reader who is interested in what's happening in the restaurant world-meets food television world of modern America, this is certainly a book that will entertain and educate."
3,uneven,"When Ruhlman sticks to descriptions of the working of a restaurant kitchen, the food, and the chef, his writing is engaging and compelling. Unfortunately he has a tendency to lapse into discussing his own feelings about cooking and how profoundly his life was changed by writing about it, and when he does this he gets pretentious and repetitive. In his 2 previous book on the subject, Making of a Chef and Soul of a Chef, this was also true but in Reach of a Chef there is so much of it that it made the book hard to get through. How many times can you read about how veal stock changed his life before gagging? It also seems like he was lacking material and so added large sections that simply rehashed the material in the 2 first books, like a review in case you hadn't read them. Overall, about half of this book was interesting, new material; the rest wasn't even worth the time it took me to skim through."
4,Return of Lum: Sweet Revenge,"Sweet Revenge is a title that may mislead some poeple into the story. Any revenge doesn't show up till half-way through this Takahashi work. But some of the stories are interesting. Tomobiki High holds a parent's day, and we see the introduction of LUm's mother, who speaks in Mahjoung tiles. There's also a funny little story of a female ninja, but this book is notable for the intro of Lum's childhood and revenge-bent friend Ran. A person who borders on ultra-cute and Frightening madness."
1,A Fine Laugh in Parts--but it depends on who you are...,"This book was recommended to me by someone who has divorced. She was clearly in the same position as Mrs. Fytton (the main character) in a lot of ways. Therefore, I can understand how many middle-aged women who are divorcee's will LOVE this book.I am, however, a single man...and felt it a bit of a ""yawn"".So...different strokes for different folks is all I can say. I did read it all the way through (with some 'I wish this would end' feelings along the way). I did find the writer had a nice style...but I would have liked a bit more story and a lot less characters."
2,Photo was wrong,"I'd rate the fan in the photo very high, but the photo is wrong, I had to return the fans. What I received was the triangle style EntreeAire fan, which doesn't move nearly as much air."
2,RECEIVED BROKEN ITEM TWICE,"This item was shipped to me months after I placed the order (though at the time of purchase Amazon showed that item was in stock). The rotating holder was broken, so I requested a replacement. Guess what a month latter I received another damaged piece. I am now being told by customer service that they are not sure how long before this item is replaced!!! I would not suggest buying this item at AMAZON."
1,Experience Grand Cayman Island Diving,We are going to Grand Cayman & I spent the money thinking this would lay out dive spots for us to try. All this video was about was some guy videotaping his dives and not telling anything about where they were.This video is worthless unless you just like looking at someone else dive photos.
3,One of the first Tyler Perry plays I liked,"I like his plays better than his movies except for the family that preys ... and Good deeds(those I loved!) Because I hated the others,especially the ""why did I get married ones"", they were almost the same as whats done in the dark, meet the Browns, family reunion and the diary of a mad black woman. Unless he goes back to making more and better plays, I will continue to look for other than his and others that makes plays and they are out there. Out of respect for Tyler, I won't say who they are. Tyler has done a lot for plays, people that wouldn't normally go to plays go now and they really enjoy live performances. This last movie, I didn't even finish watching it I was highly disappointed, the witness protection, Tyler really?"
2,movie,i did not know the movie was like a documentary. i did not like it ...it was kind of boring and too long.
5,VERY VERY FUNNY,"MADEAS FAMILY REUNION WAS VERY FUNNY, IT HAS SOMETHING FOR EVERYONE, ITS FUNNY, IT GIVES YOU SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT INTO TODAYS WORLD.''RUTH'' OF DESERT HOT SPRINGS, CALIF"
3,Very Entertaining,"This one is entertaining but lacks the wisdom of Madea and the comedy of Meet the Browns, but still very entertaining!"
5,Good play,"Tooooooo funny. I enjoyed this play. Go buy it, it is hilarious. I have it in my collection of dvds.Obedience Is Better Than Sacrifice"
3,Funny but not as funny as the other Tyler Perry plays,"After buying ""I Can Do Bad All By Myself "" & ""Madea Goes To Jail"" I had to have ""Madea's Class Reunion"". Great story as all of his plays but this one was lacking something? I didn't laugh as much as I did for the other plays, it seemed to drag from time to time."
1,confused,"I bought this movie, well thinking it was the movie but it wasnt.I dont understand why they dont specify weather or not it is a play or a movie.All that it say's is dvd. I feel like i got riped off.For those who Don't really know the difference like me this is a PLAY AND NOT A MOVIE don't get riped off to."
1,Tyler Perry's Madea's Class Reunion,I was disappointed I thought this was a movie and not a play. I like Tyler Perry but I was not happy about this.
5,Madea's Class Reunion,"Tyler Perry is a very creative, very talented man who also surrounds himself with talented and created people and together they create magic! Madea is a character he created and she always manages to use humor and believe it or not, heart lol to bring people together and solve problems and even, amazingly enough, teach you a little something along the way LOL I highly recommend this DVD as part of your DVD collection and and this seller as well, who got the DVD to me in perfect condition; nicely packaged and very quickly!"
5,Great Fun,"Tyler Perry never disappoints. It's funny but true. Human nature is the same no matter the race, color, creed."
5,madea's class reunion,"I can't wait till they come out with the movie for this play, but I enjoy Tyler Perry's work a lot. It has meaning and there is always a lesson to learn. Whether it is something that you have experienced or not, you will still be able to relate to it. This play makes me laugh and cry and the music is just so inspiring. You're gonna LOVE IT!"
3,Tyler Perry's Meadea's Class Reunion,"I love about 95% of Tyler Perry's movies and stage plays, but this one did not fall in that 95% category."
3,Not sure...,"So I am not sure if I misunderstood but I was under the impression the play Slavs! Was in this book. However, upon wireless purchase to my kindle I have not been able to find it :( the rest of the book is a wonderful read (especially if you are a Kushman fan) I just wish I could find the play."
2,Blink and it might disappear,"Buyer beware. Take your left or right hand. Now look at your pinky finger. Go to the tip of your pinky finger. Depending on the size of your hand, the tip of your pinky might be larger than this ""Italian charm."" No charm here. I am not moved."
3,The Wanderer,"I think it just was not as good as The Prophet or The MadmanAs for the first, it was my first ""contact"" with Gibran and for the last, it must be because I am probably mad myself!"
2,Foe vehicle fanatics only.,"As this is NOT what I ordered, I will be brief: it's--- interesting, if you like the various vehicles of the SW series. I personally thought I was getting the cd-rom with the Luke in the desert, Toshi Station, unused cantina sequence shots on it. A friend of mine has it, and I managed to get a camera copy of the shots, as his camera, at the time, didn't have an AV out.Thus, I am fated to wander the desert of my lust, searching but never finding a copy for myself. Unless I reorder. Feh!"
3,hmm...,"The biggest problem with this book is that the themes that Dick would later use are presented far too neatly. When you finish most Dick novels, you're never quite sure what is and what isn't. Here, the seemingly inexplicable events are all neatly tied up at the end, which rather takes away from the richness. It's still Dick, though, and thus it's still quite good.Addendum: I have no idea why I gave this four stars. It's just not that good. Insufficient claustrophobic paranoia for my personal taste. A sign of things to come, but not brilliant on its own. I dig the cover of the new Vintage edition, though. When were all these books reprinted?"
3,Joint smokes,"I liked Time but was a bit disappointed in it only because I assumed Gumm was going to be trapped inside a computer. I read a review that seemed to hint at this, and I had been warped by too much Matrix and Dark City. Thus I was surprised to see that Gumm was really living in a big prop-town like Truman Show. It's like seeing the movie preview like Batman and saying, ""This is gonna be awesome,"" and then walking away not totally satisfied. I must, however, give the Dickman his due because his books about hidden reality and alternative history strike me deep.One more thing about Joint: Why did Dick start his book with a secondary character and not Gumm himself?"
3,SF NOVELS OPUS SIX,"As a former reviewer has pointed it out, Philip K. Dick's TIME OUT OF JOINT has greatly inspired the authors of the screenplay of Peter Weir's THE TRUMAN SHOW. Ragle Gumm, the hero of TIME OUT OF JOINT, is questioning the reality he is living in, like in fact the majority of the characters created by Philip K. Dick during his literary career.Ragle Gumm's efforts to discover the ""hidden"" side of the world he has been thrown into is, in my opinion, the most interesting aspect of the novel. The science-fictional explanation of the reasons why Ragle Gumm has to play everyday is not very convincing and the analysis of the origin of the war between Lunatics and Terrians way too simple for an author such as PKD.However, TIME OUT OF JOINT provides the kind of pleasure the Philip K. Dick fan searches in vain in today sci-fi production. So don't hesitate to add this book to your collection if you are already familiar with the world of this writer."
4,Nice quality sweater,"Nice quality sweater. Was impossible to update shipping address due to third party merchant relationship, though."
3,sweater,"The wool sweater It was much thinner than I would have expectedit to be. If it would have been regular price, it would not have been worth it at all.Shipping was VERY fast."
4,Love this movie!,This movie is so funny and touching at the same time. It shows that people are still finding themselves all the time! If you like Goldie Hawn it's a must see!!!
1,Gross,Pointless movie. A waste of time. Glorifies being sexually promiscuous. Two old whores 'being themselves'..be true to yourself is the moral of this story? Goldie has been so surgically 'refreshed' as to look ridiculous.
5,AMAZING!,"I absolutely loved this movie. I have a girlfriend that is closest to my heart and has been for many years. Although we have never been ""groupies"" we have had some serious nights out being single and having fun. If you have a friend that can read your mind and is close to you, watch it!!!"
3,Sarandon and Hawn steal the show,"I was so eager to see this when it was in the movie theaters, but only got a chance to see it now that it's on VHS, and boy am I glad. Sarandon and Hawn steal the show as the Banger Sisters, and Gregory Rush is also great as the blocked writer who becomes inspired by the two friends. But the plot stinks, and the two daughters are annoying beyond any redeeming value. There is one half-decent scene where the two young sisters are talking in their bedroom, but it's not enough."
2,Not Memorable,"With Geoffrey Rush, Goldie Hawn, and Susan Sarandon in the cast one would hope for something better than this. I feel that if this movie had been a little more fleshed out, it would have been ""good"". However, as it stands, I can not recommend this movie, and I say that with regret."
2,"BOB DOLMAN, OPUS 1","** 2002. Written and directed by Bob Dolman. Golden Globe nomination for Goldie Hawn. Twenty years after, two friends remember their debauched youth as groupies. If Goldie Hawn and Susan Sarandon's performances may please you if you're a fan, like me, of these actresses, you'll be alas horrified by the vacuity of the screenplay of this film."
3,Not a terrible way to spend an hour and a half,"I saw the Banger Sisters last night. My wife really wanted to see it so I sat through. I was surprised that some of the comedy was REALLY funny and its the first time I've been engaged by Goldie Hawn in a really long time.What's curious is that this is kind of a play against type.Goldie plays an older version of Penny Lane, the 'Almost Famous' part that was done by her daughter. Older but still the quick and easy Bandaid her daughter played, it was kind of wierd. Susan Sarandon on the other hand would have been a natural for the Goldie Hawn part, if for no other reason than she did such an outstanding job in White Palace (which was a great movie made from an even better book).The ending is formulaic but the rest will have you grinning and laughing out loud."
1,A clanker from beginning to end,"This movie is a skunk for the eyes and ears. Just about everything about it stinks. The script, the directing, most of the performances, the set designs... all stink. THE BANGER SISTERS was filmed in STINK-A-RAMA. This is a THELMA AND LOUISE for the stupid. I'm not even going to go on about it. It's not worth it."
3,It Ain't All That Bad...,"...I thought I was in for another one of those chick flicks that are done to say ""overall-men-are-pigs"", but came out with a pleasant surprise with the interplay of the two leads. You could believe that Sarandon and Hawn kicked it lively a bit in their 20's.They would have had a blast together, if they could turn back the hands of time and hang out together in real life, I'd bet. When the repressed Lavinia starts to loosen up, you can start to see what Susie loved about her bigger sister figure...And I tell ya. Hawn and Saradon at forty plus? They're still babes."
1,DOESNT WORK,I purchased this DVD for my mothers birthday and it will not play on any DVD player in the house. Not due to scratches or any of those issues. The screen will say something along the lines of not compatible.
4,How can you go wrong with Goldie and Susan.,You can always count on great performances from those two actors. My only comment is the beginning. For some reason the first reel (20 minutes) is a bit boring and i thought a better segway could have been provided for the two main stars to reunite. But when the film gets going it's wonderful talented comedy the rest of the way. The story also has a wonderful moral aspect which is basic and true. You ALWAYS meet people for a reason.This is a fun film to watch and Goldie and Susan have never looked better. They are ageless.
1,Give Me A Break! This Unrealistic Movie Is So Lame,What the heck is the point of this movie? That being a skanky slut is better then being a well respected member of society? This movie is so unrealistic. Are we really susposed to believe that a mother could show up looking like a hooker at her daughter's high school graduation which was at a ritzy exclusive private school and her family and every parent and student would cheer and be ok with it? No way! She would in the REAL world be a laughing stock and her family would be shocked and angry and the other students and parents would be shocked and disappointed and would most likely gossip about her and not invite her to any of their social functions anymore.
3,The Banger Sisters Rock!,"This movie definitely makes me laugh out loud and the chemistry between Goldie Hawn and Susan Sarandon is fabulous. I was a little suprised by the raunchy humor in this movie, but I think that is what makes it so funny. I did feel that the story as a whole was a little rushed, and how in one day everybody lived happily ever after. All in all, this is a great movie to watch with girlfriends - you'll definitely have some laughs!"
2,The over-the-hill Gang rides again,"Seeing Goldie prance around like a five dollar hooker was very upsetting...I enjoyed the Geoffry Rush character and I think it would have been a better movie if the movie was more about him. Sarandon is a great actress and did her best to make the part work. But I could never get past the cartoon character that Goldie provided. She was in fact the heroine in the story. She understood children, even if she had none of her own. She saved and resurrected the soul of Geoffry and Susan, even if her life was a total wipe-out. Unbelievable!Save your 8 bucks, wait for the video."
1,And the point is????,"In ""The Banger Sisters"", fifty-somethings Hawn and Sarandon prove that Spandex should only be worn by twenty-somethings. Beyond that, it's a sad film peopled with caricatures rather than characters. The message seems to be that life as an upstanding citizen is a bad and deadly boring thing but reliving a former life in the fast lane can keep you ""true"". Savoring the past is fine, but try to keep on living it and you just might end up - like Hawn's character - broke and out of gas somewhere in the desert."
2,"More Like ""The Boring Sisters""","As much I love Susan Sarandon and Goldie Hawn, I foudn this movie quite boring with a predictable plot, unlikeable supporting characters, and slow pacing. Susan and Goldie trie their hardest, but even they can't overcome the bland script. Goldie is her normal silly outragous self, but she tries to hard and Kate Hudson did the blond, ditzy groupie role better in Almost Famous, which is a shame. Susan does well with what she can, but she seems bored. Geoffrey Rush should be embarrassed to play the role he played, and Erika Christenson and the other actress playing Susans daughter in the film, are so obnoxioulsy annoying, I wanted to fast forward all of their scenes. This could have been a better film, if it had better writers and better supporting actors, but all you get is a mess of a film that wastes the talents of two remarkable actresses."
4,Great Movie For A Limited Audience,This movie will be highly enjoyed by stay at home moms. As a SAHM I loved it. I really enjoyed the comparison between Finny and Susette. Some people will enjoy this and some will not. I think that it deserved better ratings that it recieved from the critics. It is not nearly as bad as they made it out to be.
3,Banger Sisers,"Twenty years later the character played by Sarandon has grown up, but the Hawn one is still stuck in her twenties. This movie is about that reunion and were life has and will take these two. I was disapointed in the plot line. Hawn is fired from her job and ""whalla needs to look up her rich friend."" Sarandon's character decides to loosen up after her friend appears and does, but what does that have to do with how her family deals with her transformation and what will happen with this next? The film is sometimes crude, do we really need to view the poloroids of male body parts from their collection of previous encounters? There is a reason for the title, do we need to dwell on it more that once? The movie does have some laughs, some fun, it's fun to see these two together, but with thir talents it could have been so much more."
2,"A Weak Plot ,but Geoffrey Rush Gives a Good Performance!","I like all of the actors in The Banger Sisters, Geoffrey Rush, Goldie Hawn and Susan Sarandon but the movie isn't very good.It was the weak plot and the fact that most of the characters were unlikeable and far fetched that makes this movie so unenjoyable and the only likeable character is the sad sack played by Geoffrey Rush who does a great American accent and I would recommend this movie only for his superb performance!"
3,Goldie Hawn is great in this,"The subject matter is that two groupies who slept with pretty much every musician in the world during the 70's are now much older. The Sarandon character has suppressed all of that, is married with two kids, and has had her personality disappear. The Hawn character is still a free spirit and revels in her past. However, she is now wise. Of course, the Hawn character seeks out the Sarandon character and reinvigorates her life, and her family is grateful that their wife and mother was once a world class groupie.I believe that there is a certain consensus about this film. The script is pretty weak regardless of its subject matter. Goldie Hawn is fantastic in it.As my own comment, it is actually hard to tell if this is a movie about women achieving something or some kind of odd male fantasy. If Hawn had not saved this movie, it would be a real rotten tomato. Incidently, the title of this film is taken from one of the most famous/infamous porno flicks of all time."
2,Save your time and money.,"Sorry, but I can't recommend this one. I found myself scanning through the pages to get to the end. While the main characters were physically appealing, their actions were not. I could explain in more detail, but even this review is not worth the time."
4,Too bad about the ending,"Living in a small Maine town, I can attest to the veracity of Chute's vision. The characters are well-realized. Many scenes are breath-takingly well-written. Two problems with the novel: (1) It would be better without Chute's sermons about the grotesque evils of hunting & corporate America. (2) It would be a great novel with a different ending. The final act of the protagonist, Lloyd Barrington, is uncharacteristically & gratuitously cruel. That Chute had to change her protagonist's personality shows that she did not know how to end this wonderful, sprawling novel."
2,not what was expected,Both my son and I were disappointed when we opened the book. We thought it was going to be a middle school level book for my 10 year old like another book from the same author. Instead it was a much lower reading level with very few words on each page and mostly pictures. He finished it in 10 minutes or less. What a waste of the money we spent on it!
4,Wonderful book!,"I purchased this book for my classroom library (I teach middle school Reading/Language Arts) because many students have read and enjoyed ""The Invention of Hugo Cabret."" All of us who have read this book have liked it very much. It's especially good for students who might read at a slightly lower than grade-level, but are aided by the excellent pictures."
5,For the Young -- and young at heart,"Fans of Harry Potter as well as fans of prestidigitation will definitely enjoy this short book. Of course, it's (kind of) about Houdini -- particularly a young boy's fascination with the magician and his feats; and there's a wonderful twist at the end. The illustrations are also terrific, soft but detailed, with lots of things to look at. A fine ""read to me"" book that everyone will enjoy again and again."
3,The Beauty Bride,"Although this was a very well-written story, it dragged out way too much and had it not been for such unneeded sexual detail, it would have been idea for Young Adults as well."
5,Great read!!,My attention was captured from the very first page; and the action parts were great as well. I will definitely look for more books by this author.
4,hte beauty bride,this is a good story with some unseen twists. it also shows how far we have come as women. our right have grown by a lot. i is a story that make you feel what the charicters are felling
5,Awesome story,I really enjoyed this tale! It keeps you wondering what will happen next and hoping your right :)! Recommend for those wanting to read a dreamy tale!
2,Fairly good story but over-use of words,"I purchased the Kindle version of the book but have to believe that the hard copy was the same. There were way too many instances of the word ""vigor"". In most cases, another word would have suited the purpose much better and shows a lack of vocabulary. The word ""suzerainty"" was also very much over-used and may not have been the appropriate word in any of its instances.However, the plot was fairly good and unusual but the hero's behaviour was inconsistent and I couldn't get a good feel for the heroine."
4,A must read,Excellent series read all of them light easy read makes you smile and light hearted and at times want to kill brother but well worth it more people would respond and rate these books if it was not so involved with so many words etc
4,Really a good book,This is the first time I have read a book by Claire Delacroix. She is a really good author. I enjoyed this book and now I have to read the rest in the series .
4,Really engaging story,"I enjoyed reading THE BEAUTY BRIDE and I liked the way the characters interacted. I especially liked the imagery which was very graphic and descriptive; it helped me immerse myself in the story. There were some things that bothered me, though. Even though Elizabeth, at twelve years old, would have been considered an adult by the standards of her time, she was still a child who had always been sheltered. I just can't see her behaving the way she did in the story. Another thing that annoyed me was the frequent editing mistakes because they interrupted the flow of the story. This was a shame because the writing style itself was very nice. Overall, this story held my interest and I definitely recommend it."
4,Very entertaining,I enjoyed The Beauty Bride and intend to read more books by Claire Delacroix. The story is fast paced and kept my interest throughout. I had read a contemporary book by Deborah Cooke (Claire Delacroix) and decided to try one of her historical novels. This is the first in a series and I plan to read them all.
2,No go for me,"This book was off to a great start. However, I was sorely disappointed when I got to the fairies. That was it for me. Unfortunately, nowhere in the description is there anything about fairies and it completely turned me off enough that I didn't go any further."
2,Glad it was a free book.,I really did not care for this book. I find it to be dense with story telling while not really carrying the main storyline successfully. I got it so I finished it but I am so thankful it was free. Others may like it well enough but personally it is not something I recommend.
4,Nice read.,"Great love story. I loved the Welsh lore. It was a little slow at parts with non-essentials (well what I thought was nonessential information), but otherwise filled with history, whimsical humor, and romance."
5,A Winner !,"A winning start for a series! For Madeline and Rhys, a marriage began for all the wrong reasons. With the help of Darg, the fairy, this novel weaves through the countryside of Scottland and Wales.And, of course, true love wins above greed, betrayal, lust and stupidity.This is a thoroughly entertaining read of the 1400""s and all the turmoil to settle the rightful sovernity of Caereoyn and the Crown. Follow the golden threads woven among the blue and white threads of all their lives.Very enjoyable historical novel with just a touch of magic!The entire series:Beauty Bride ,Rose Red Bride, Show White Bride , Ballad of Rosamunde"
3,The beauty bride was very fanciful and held my interest,Loved the Welch tales included in the storyline and the brooding nature of the hero. Love those strong silent types
4,No Sophomore Jinx For Ms. Barrino!!!!,"I was a little worried upon hearing the premiere of the first single ""Hood Boy"" on radio stations across the country. I still believe that this wasn't the strongest first single to launch the return of Fantasia, however part of being an entertainer is to express yourself lyrically. To put it plain, Fantasia is and has always been a strong vocalist and this is what makes the cd a solid effort and a great purchase. Fantasia absolutely soars on ""I Nominate U"", ""only One U"", and ""I Feel Beautiful"" which could all be singles. Other strong highlights are ""When I See U"", ""Surround U"", ""2 Weeks Notice"", and ""Baby Makin Hips"". Listen for yourself, if you truly love R&B music then you won't be dissapointed!!"
4,Great Effort!!!,"When I first listened to this cd, I thought 'I don't like it'. However, the more I listen to it, the more I like it! I guess I was expecting something like her last cd. Boy am I glad I didn't get it! I have to admit that I like this one better than the first cd.I am 40 and was looking forward to more mellow tones to kick back with my hubby. With this being said, my favorites are ""I Feel Beautiful""and ""Two Weeks Notice"". However, I have started to really like a lot of the uptempo songs! Of course, I just love Fantasia's voice, but I tend to forget that she is only 22 and she still wants to dance. She actually makes me want to turn it up in my car like the young folks! It is definitely different than the music I usually listen to and I'm happy for the diversion!"
2,Fantasia Goes to Broadway,"Fantasia has the staying power to transend all generations, or so I thought. Her voice is powerful and blessed. Her capabilities transend this album. The song are rappish in nature, and offer no power as summertime and Maybe i didn't love you. Fantasia, please go back in the booth and sing us songs from Broadway, the wiz, or Dreamgirls. The second album could have been made by a mediocre singer. Fantasia is worth to all of us, much more than this album."
2,Why Lie?,"Fantasia is one of my two favorite female artists and this ""too"" reeks of another disappointing ""2nd"" effort. The tracks produced by Missy are awful. I pray that Fantasia's team will not solicit her assistance on the next project; she's played out! Fantasia has talent...point blank she can sing. However, the tired beats just don't get it. Be truthful if you're a real fan, Fantasia can do much better. In fairness to perspective buyers there are at least 3 decent tracks on the CD but most of the tracks don't flow well. It's like she forcing herself in an unatural way to sing to the track rather than simply flowing with the music.AND, If you're hearing the chipmunks perhaps its due to the poor quality of your bootlegged copy!"
2,WHAT THA!!!,"I am a fan of Fantasia but this is not a good follow up for ""Free Yourself"" she needs to tone it back down a little. I will not be purchasing this one. She and Ruben fell off for real!! Their talent is greater than what they are putting out, needs some new producers."
4,SteppinOut,"This sophomore lp is great fantasia took a risk by stepping out of the american idol box, she gave us some real music on this on... i love it!"
3,Not what I expected... However one or two tracks are hot!,"I loved her first album from the beginning to the end.. I liked it so much. I purchased two more for christmas presents. Fantasia's second ablum is ok. ""When I see u"" is the hottest track on the ablum.. I didnt really notice it on the album. However, once I heard it in the club. Its definitely a go.."
2,a After school special Mary J.Bliege to this point,"Fantasia is on her 2nd album&is fast moving away from Her American Idol days. Vocally she has some decent moments,but overall She just mainly comes across as a After school special version of Mary J.Bliege. the lead off track with Big Boi ""Hood Boy"" sounds like a cliched type of track at maintaining a Hood Pass as a Song. it goes nowhere. she is following closely the MJB Formula of balancing out Drama&the Day to Day Grind. to this point she doesn't get material that fully captures her range. it's a Hit&Miss Album more things are balanced because of the Production,but She still isn't being handled the right way as a Artist. she is channeling alot of Modern acts on here,but She still doesn't have her own Idenity as a Artist yet."
2,Fantasia is much better than this album exhibits,"Fantasia has truly fallen from her Idol status. The beats and lyrics on this album are re-used and tired. I was expecting so much more from this artisit, but was let down by the forth song. Make sure you hear someone else's copy before you buy it yourself."
3,Where is Fantasia?,"I was waiting for this CD to be released. Couldn't wait. I was so very dissapointed. Why don't American Idol winners pay attention to what style music made them winners - showcased their voice. I finally decided that it was directed at the teen set, so I let my daughter play it. She was less than enthusiatic. Fantasia where are you?????"
3,Not her best,"I was anticipating buying her CD when it came out. Dont get me wrong I like it, but it could have been better. Her first CD is way much better than this one. I like a few songs on this CD, but it isnt half. And if its not half it wasnt worth buying (my opinion). I like the song produced by Brian Micheal-Cox. Other than that, she screams entirley too much especially on Hood Boy. I'm not sure if i can sit thru a concert it drives me crazy!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Failed to impress this time round,"Let me start by saying I am huge fan of Fantasia and never stop raving about her. Her debut cd was the best thing since sliced bread and far exceeded expectaions. This one though is so boring. I haven't managed to listen to one track right the way through yet. I keep persisting with it out of loyalty, but I find it has taken Fantasia in an unknown direction . Rather than highlighting her amazing vocal ability, it seems to just focus on bass beats and I for one just miss the whole pointI only hope Fantasia returns to her best with her next effort and is able to restore my faith in her. She is truly talented and anyone who wants to buy a cd shoud definitely go for her first effort and I can guarantee they'll love it!"
5,Fantasia,This a great cd. She song about things women go through everyday. I really enjoy listening to this cd.
2,What Happened !,"I STARTED TO PURCHASE THIS CD JUST BECAUSE, THEN I LISTENED TO THE SAMPLES, WELL WHAT CAN I SAY, I'LL PASS ON THIS ONE. I THINK BALLADS ARE HER STRONG POINT. I HOPE SHE DOESN'T LOOSE HER AUDIENCE BECAUSE OF HER CHANGE OF STYLE."
5,Definitely Grammy and Multiple Platinum Worthy!,"There is something for everyone on this album! From Daughters to Grandmothers, ""Fantasia"" has it all!We get to see a Youthful Fun Side to Tasia. And I love it!Hoodboy, Baby Making Hips, Not the Way that I Do, Unelligible, Three Week NOtice, I Feel Beautiful, and lastly, Bump What Your Friends Say are all ""Single Worthy"" tunes. This is the best album I have purchased in over 25 years (I am a 58 year old grandma).A Must HAVE!"
3,Ok if you really like urban music,"This CD is not what I was expecting from the former Idol winner. Not too many ballards, the cd is full of funky beats, more club like tunes. It is okay but not much substance."
2,OK,"Simply OK, recommend to pass unless you're a super Fantasia fan, if not, this recording will not make you a huge fan."
3,FANTASIA!!!!,"Although not as good as her first cd, I still love that voice and wished she showcased it more. But overall, the cd consists of some pretty decent songs.On another note, if you haven't seen FANTASIA on Broadway in THE COLOR PURPLE, you should!!!! FANTASIA is beautiful, and she's here!!!!!"
4,Much Better than the First,"I have both of her CDs and I was a bit hesitant to get this one because I did not like the 1st 2 singles that much but now I can't stop playing When I See you and I love Nominate you, Only One U and 2 Weeks notice. There are maybe 2 others I like. I am not into the fast tracks but the slow ones are excellent and she is speaking great messages...."
3,Not As Good As Expected,"Fantasia's second wasnt' as good as Free Yourself. I was able to play that CD without skipping any tracks, but this time around it wasn't the same. The first half of the album was good but the second half I was skipping around. Its an okay album, but I hope she comes back with fire the next time around. Good Luck on Broadway."
2,Not impressed,"OK? ""Hood Boy""? Can you say DONE ALREADY by Destiny's Child (""Soldier"")? I wasn't impressed with this CD. You can tell Missy was all up and through this production (fast beats and lyrics). I know Fantasia is young, but I don't really think this CD is ""her."" The beats and lyrics are very ""clubby."" It doesn't compliment her voice at ALL.Yes, there are a FEW good songs on this CD (I Nominate U; I Feel Beautiful; Two Weeks Notice), but overall, I wouldn't recommend buying it."
5,"Fantasia's on her ""grown woman""","Fantasia really came hard with this album. I put this cd in and listened to all tracks non-stop, then played it back. ""Two-week Notice"", is a for sure hit, I think everyone can relate to wanting to drop that notice on someone at some point in time. Fantasia has grown up in front of our faces and she definately shows this in this album. This is a must have and it gets a lot of play time in my mp3, my car, my computer, I even have the ""Baby makin hips"" as a ringtone and call tone on my cell phone!!!!"
4,Good Ol' Rock & Roll!,It's Kansas. Really need I say more? This is one of my favorite albums. Carry On My Wayward Son is probably my favorite Kansas song. Just get it!
3,ok,"Not all the great Kansas songs I really like, but it's ok. It only costs me 5 bucks so still a good buy."
4,Good but could have been better,"The sound is truly great on this cd, but the choice of songs is very odd. It is the classics though that remind me why Kansas has a soft spot in my heart."
3,Wayward son,I bought this specifically for the Carry on my wayward son song which i luv. There's another song or two that i like as well. I'm not much for this kind of music but Kansas is pretty cool.
5,A great album!,"This album originally came out in 1984, and was the FIRST Kansas compilation album. Pretty hot, it contained the best from the glory days of Kansas - Carry On My Wayward Son, Point Of Know Return, Dust In The Wind, and so forth. It's a great album, one that is sure to please any Kansas fan!Now, don't confuse this album with the 1999 updated and remastered Best Of Kansas. The price is about the same, but Perfect Lover was dropped off, and replaced with three later tracks. It's a tough call, so choose wisely, my son!"
4,"1 less song, 1less star. What happened to ""Perfect Lover""?","Kansas rocks, the extra tracks are great, but I can't believe they dropped ""Perfect Lover"" from this album. I didn't notice this until after I ripped out the plastic-wrap. My old tan cassette of this exact album had a hard-rockin' single called ""Perfect Lover"" on side B preceding ""No One Together"". I now hold this CD feeling incomplete without this particular favorite. The only CD I could find with that song is in their Imported ""Definitive Collection"" release."
3,one extra song,as a fan of kansas I bought this greatest hits only for an extra song perfect lover good songs as a hits but this new only availablee on the 1984 cd.
3,A greatest hits album........,"...withOUT one of the strangest rock n roll anthems ever recorded, Incomudro - Hymn to the Atman, off the Song for America album. I have absolutely no idea what that title means, but it is a great song. Great song..........."
3,disappointing representation,"If you have nothing by Kansas and want ONLY the hits, this is the one to get. (If you have some familiarity with their albums, drop a few extra bucks and get The Ultimate Kansas). The biggest hits are here, but the album cuts are suspect; not representing the best of their material. Hopefully you like some of them. They certainly do not suck, but could easily be replaced by some stronger choices.Kansas is my favorite band and I would like to see them displayed in their best light. This would be my line-up for a single cd Best Of Kansas:"
5,An excellent album,"The original Best of Kansas album came out in 1984, and was the band's first compilation album. In 1999 the album was updated and remastered. The album was updated in that the tune Perfect Lover was dropped off, and replace with three other tracks - The Pinnacle, The Devil Game and Closet Chronicles.What can I say, it's an excellent album. True, if you already have the original 1984 album, you might want to skip this one, and go for The Ultimate Kansas. However, if your old copy is shot or gone, this makes a great replacement - remastered and with the new track listing. I recommend it!"
1,SORRY BUT ONLY ONE GOOD SONG!!!!,THIS KANSAS COLLECTION DIDN'T DO SO GOOD...THE ONLY GOOD SONG IS CARRY ON WAYWARD SON. THAT IS THE ONLY SONG I HAVE EVER HEARD ON THE RADIO.
2,disappointing track selection,"Kansas had their moments, especially in the late 70s, but this isn't the definitive collection by any stretch. The 80s songs weren't much good when they were new, and they sure haven't gotten better with age.If all you want are their Big Three hits -- Wayward, Dust, and Point -- plus the beautiful Song For America, then by all means pick up this album. But if you want more bang for your buck, buy Leftoverture and Point Of Know Return instead and figure out some alternate way to score SFA."
2,strange tunes,There are only two songs on this cd that I reconize. The rest is a waste unless you love Kansas.
1,Kansas MP3 download to My Computer,I ordered and paid for the Kansas MP3 album to be downloaded to my computer and I have not recieved it yet. That is why I do not like this product.
2,Disappointment,"Pass up the CD and download the MP3 files for their two hits (Dust in the Wind, Carry on Wayward Son). Two stars for two songs--What a waste of money. K"
3,More Kansas Please,"For musicians with at least eleven albums recorded including a double live offering this mostly classically trained group is presented in a very thin offering on this compilation. The biggest problem is that Kansas didn't have a lot of singles released. There were a lot of semi quasi concept albums available. One of my favourite cuts was from the album Leftoverture titled ""What's on my Mind"". I think that a reevaluation should be done on Kansas' albums to flesh out this package to at least eighteen to twenty cuts."
4,The absolute best of Bob Dole country...,"This collection is an eloquent testimonial to the majesty that is Kansases's' songwriting and playing and stuff. A must for those who can't afford any more shelf space than necessary for these classics, this album highlights the acculturation of these prairie popsters. Though the allegorical parallels between Dust in the Wind and Rhyme of the Ancient Mariner have been widely written about, this is a good chance to compare it to the collaborations with Eugene Ormandy, Arthur Fiedler, and Vince Guaraldi that produced Closet Chronicles and Song for America, respectively. ( Fortunately, these projects turned out much better for Kansas than for, say, the James Gang, who had to get a restraining order to keep Mr. Guaraldi off stage during their performances.) The omission of Pachuco Cadaver from this collection is a little disappointing, but you won't notice if you turn it up loud enough."
5,Corporate Arena Rock? What?,"What exactly does that mean? And whatever that is, it must KICK [BUTT] because bands like Kansas, Styx, Foreigner, etc. rock! They are the reasons why I like classic rock... and the reasons why many others like classic rock. Um, that's the reason why they are played so much on classic rock stations... because people like them. And why would you (Bobby Clark) say they are for the mindless? I find the lyrics of many of the songs to be rather enlightening and unoffensive and thoughtful, and that goes along with beats/rhythms/etc. that rock!Hey, I like the Ramones and the Clash too though."
3,GREAT BAND. ODD OMISSIONS.,"I'm not going to join your feud as it's none of my business. I've got my own internet war raging in the video section mostly (starting with ALIEN and ALIENS; although the poor Carpenters are being exploited shamelessly - and a few books too), but I do want to say that at moments Kansas rises to the top of contemporary music (no matter who lines up). ""Mother Nature Suite"" is a personal favorite, and ""Dust in the Wind"" was utilized so well at the close of the film ""Heroes"" it warrants an honor medal. A pivotal ensemble of talented musicians that molded the landscape of music anew. Did I say that?"
5,"Kansas doesn't rule, the dominate!","I am getting older.I am finding that I prefer intelligent music.Music that not only gets your body moving, but also gets you thinking.Kansas delivers both.From the poetic ""Masque"" (my favorite),to the wild mind shattering ""Freaks of Nature""especially ""Black fathom four""..I have not found a band that can top them.Can't wait for the next cd.I know they won't dissapoint,they never have.Listen to the words."
2,One good song.,"I absolutely loved that song ""Carry On Wayward Son"" which sounds like one of the greatest stuff in history. Rest of the other songs on this album are not that good. 2-stars."
1,Kansas = Horrible,"more slickly produced corporate arena rock for the mindless. Bands like them, Styx, REO Speedwagon, Foreigner are what makes classic rock radio so unlistenable. Why they play these guys in favor of the Clash or the Ramones is beyond my comprehension. I cannot recommend this CD for anybody. Someone ought to shoot these guys and put them out of their misery"
4,Great songs!,I'm so happy I bought this cd. I just love classic rock and this definitely fits the bill!! You will not be disappointed!
5,One Hell of a CD,"I think that the band, will go down in history, and this will be one of the major hightlights. the best song, is ""Dust in the Wind"" it it one hell of a great song."
4,This is a 'Perfect Lover',"This is a good Kansas album. I really like 'Carry On Wayward Son', 'Dust In The Wind', and 'Perfect Lover'. Buy this album and really enjoy Kansas."
1,US price versus Canadian,The book is just what I was looking for. It met all my expectations.I am a conscientious shopper. I checked prices in Victoria. With the dollar at par I saved just under seven dollars buying through Amazon - this included the shipping. Until we start refusing to buy overpriced books in Canada we will be gouged by the retailers. Buy on line and save.Ron
1,Too Cartoony,"This was my least favorite. I took three guides over, this one, the Maui for Dummies and a Lonely Planet guide. The Dummie guides assumed I was in search of a paradise island. Well, I'm not a cocktail toting romanticist and all I wanted the guidebook to reveal was uncommercial untouristy places to go. Zilcho. I'm sticking with Lonely Planet for real reporting of all the important and offbeat places."
3,Frommers is better,"I bought hawaii for Dummies and Frommers Hawaii. Haven't gone on the trip yet, but I find myself trusting the Frommers information more than the Dummies info. I even got a few tips from Frommers that saved us $80 on helicopter tours that weren't mentioned in Dummies. We're taking a cruise around Hawaii, and neither book gives you information about how to get around from the cruiseship ports which would have been really helpful."
1,All Puff,"Hawaii for Dummies was not usable and light when it came to driving details. We should have splurged and bought a book for each of the islands we visited: Kauai, Oahu and Maui. Now you know."
4,Hawaii Simplified,"Dear John: Letters From a Fan in New York City: An Interactive BookWhen you go to Hawaii for the first time (as I did last year to reward myself for three years of writing and no vacation) you want to make sure you know where to start. There is no better book than the Hawaii for Dummies to take along with any other book on Hawaii which is more specific.This is a place to start, before you even book your trip. Read it from cover to cover a while before you go, and take it with you, too.Most of the 'must-sees' are right on. Gives you a road map, before embarking on your chosen islands and itineraries."
4,Southerntraveler 1585,"Great quick reference , highly recomend before going to Hawaii . It's quick,simple and accurate ... I found the index very helpfull in grasping the information , we needed for this wonderful trip. I would recomend Maui over Ohaou for the full tropical experince...."
1,Very few good one-liners,"I was disappointed. There are a couple of good one-liners by various speakers and writers, but those written by the authors are poor. These are the large majority."
3,Gimme more.....,Another nice book with some good photos but expected a little more terms of variety of mosses reviewed. Certainly could have included more photos....
1,Would be a better book if the author could get over himself,I read this book from cover to cover and while it does have some great information the author is far too long winded and can't seem to stay on track. He seems to have an ego far larger than the minute moss he writes about and it really ruined the book for me.More moss and less ego stroking please!
1,Total Bore,"After all of the hype I read about this book I was very excited when purchasing it, however when it arrived I found the supposed 'beautiful photographs' to look badly out of date and the writers egotistical attitude to be very annoying.The author is so egotistical he A. Leaves what his publisher told him to write about in his opening, in the books opening. B. Acts like he is a Messiah to moss because he moves from home to home studying and growing it for several years. Because of reasons A & B I have not been able to pickup this book again since dragging myself past 8 pages."
3,The Joy of... or HYI?,"The other reviews, both positive and negative, seem to be on the mark. I think the words, ""The Joy of"" should have preceded the title. I was personally looking for a little more of the ""How to"" in this book about gardening. '...not much about lichens. It was both funny and long winded at times. It was beautiful but not as informative as I would have liked. This makes a great, compact sized, coffee table book but not a very good HYI text book."
4,See the light only when you there,I installed four of these units - 1 in a hallway and three in individual bedrooms. I had to return one unit because it would not activate even after adjusting the sensitivity setting. Three out of the four I have installed work great! You just walk into the room and the lights come on. You feel funny at first since it is tough to break a habit of turning a light on and off. The last unit I have sometimes does not want to work in the overide mode (not activated by motion mode - just turn on). We like the units - especially with two teenagers. The installation is straight forward. You have to make sure that you are willing to wire switches and understand the necessary precautions while working with electricity (like ALWAYS tturning the circuit breaker off to the light switch you are changing the switch for.
2,Does sleeping with Notorious BIG constitute stealing lyrics?,"I really respect Lil Kim and I think she has a lot of talent but while I was journaling Light in August by Faulkner for school, I came across something very interesting. As Lil Kim is very original, I feel that she has a credibility problem. I was listening to the song ""Big Poppa"" by Notorious BIG, whom Lil Kim had a relationship with. One of his lyrics is ""Now check it, I got more mck than craig and in the bed--Believe me sweetie I got enough to feed the needy"" and his album, Ready to Die was released in 1994. Interesting. In Lil Kims song, The Jumpoff, she has a lyric ""Got a man in Japan and a dude in Tahiti--Believe me sweety I got enough to feed the needy."" Coincidence? I have no idea. Perhaps Queen Bee is not as original as we all think. This CD is good but I question the originality of her work now. Watch out."
3,"Rap's ""Who's That?"" Convention.","For this album, Lil' Kim's lyrical style is slower (both on witticisms and epiphanies) and more boring than usual. How many times are we going to hear that Lil' Kim likes to have sex, wear expensive clothes, and drive nice cars? Kim may be one of the best braggarts around but she lacks the vocal luster to back it up. The only thing that shines and makes this album slightly irresistible is the background noise that accompanies her vocals (i.e. ""Doin' It Way Big"", ""Thug Luv"", and ""Tha Beehive""). To prove how unable she is to stand alone, Kim performs four of eight full-length tracks solo. Kim had it together for HARDCORE and some of NOTORIOUS K.I.M. but she's definitely lost her diamond sparkle for this compilation reminiscent of SOURCE HIP HOP PRESENTS."
2,SOUNDS MORE LIKE A SOUNDTRACK THAN A SOLO ALBUM,"Out of 16 tracks on ""La Bella Mafia,"" Lil' Kim appears in only three songs where she performs on her own. The rest of this CD consists of nothing but colabos. 50 cent saves the day with the best song on this album, the ""magic stick,"" already a club favorite from coast to coast. Other than that, this is typical Lil Kim stuff, sex, sex, sex, and I can do it better than any broads in the game..."
2,What are theses people thinking,"The best song is the jump off..with the exception of 2 others..this CD is garbage...I think Lil Kim is tight but the tracks are weak,,and I thought it was going to be more like her first single..But I do like the look change for her....Maybe her next one will be better"
1,more personality than Artist,"not much to really say about Her as a Artist.yes She has a Catchy song here&there from time to time but more often than not She is Wack! same ole Formula driven Material.still She is able to Maintain Her Hustle so I give her Props for that,but as a Artist not much has changed at all.Her flows are only alright on someone else's Hooks to me.a whole album of Her is to much."
1,Don't buy this cd,"I just bought this based on other reviews here. I don't know what these people are talking about. I thought the beats would be more the first single ""the jump off."" But they aren't. A lot of them are really slow. That with the fact that she can't rap makes for a really dissapointing cd. What a waste of money."
2,Track 9 - This Is A Warning - Homemade Like,"Now That I've listened to the whole album.. I have to say, that Lil Kim got worse with each LP that came out.. This is definetely the weakest of her Albums.especially Track 9.. What's it supposed to be?!It sounds like homemade singing over R. Kelly's ""A Women's Threat"".. Her singing voice is so ugly, an insult to Mr Kelly..The only Song I really like is ""Magic Stick"" feat. 50 Cent - This track is tight!I hope she will be improving again on her next LP!"
3,3.5,I thought Lil Kim stepped her game up a little bit but her content is still hoeish.But I like her hard songs like Came back for you and The Beehive.But I don't see how she calls herself queen when she lacks focus.
3,We miss you Biggie,"I gave this album 3 stars. One for ""The Jump Off"", one for ""Magic Stick"", and one for ""Get In Touch With Us"". These are the only songs worth listening to.Ever since Biggie died, I noticed that Kim's material has grown stale. It is obvious that she benefitted greatly from the guidance and lyrical genius of the great Notorious One. As for comparisons to Foxy Brown, another female rapper with a similar style, I believe that Foxy is the better rapper.Kim spends a great deal of time on her image, and very little on rhyming skills. When you get passed the shock value and explicit ... imagery, she is just an o.k. rapper.If you want to hear her best album, buy ""Hardcore""."
4,Kim back and better than ever,"Lil Kim really proved herself with this album from NOTORIOUS KIMShe shows her rhyming skills with good production.I would advise Foxy,Eve,Trina to beware.Songs I reviewed1. Intro BIG 10/102. Hold It Now (feat. Havoc) 5/103. Doing It Way Big 10/104. Can't F**k with Queen Bee (feat. Governor & Shelene Thomas with Full Force) 4/105. Hollyhood Skit6. Shake Ya Bum Bum (feat. Lil' Shanice) 7/10 Something for the kids7. This Is Who I Am (feat. Swizz Beatz & Mashonda)10/108. The Jump Off (feat. Mr. Cheeks)10/109. This Is a Warning 6/1010. (When Kim Say) Can You Hear Me Now? (feat. Missy Elliott) 8/1011. Thug Luv (feat. Twista) 10/1012. Magic Stick (feat. 50 Cent)10/1013. Get in Touch with Us (feat. Styles P) 10/1014. Heavenly Father (feat. ""Big Hill"") 10/1015. Tha Beehive (feat. Reeks, Bunky S.A., Vee & Saint from the Advakids 10/10 (Kim snaps on this one)16. Came Back for You 10/10Something nice she did for the fans"
5,HOT,"this is Kim's best work. I have been following her since the Junior M.A.F.I.A. and i think she put her all in this CD. Don't be suprised if Kim wins a grammy for best female rap artist this year. Mama got her head on straight, her lyrics together, and is ready to take this rap game over. Since her album dropped, i think her hype put a dent in Fabolous' record sale casue it came out on the same day. If you haven't picked up this album....GET IT. if you a Kim fan, She ""Came back for you"" so ""Do it way BIG"" and pick up La Bella Mafia."
4,You MUST Get This CD!,"I bought La Bella Mafia on its release date and I must say I am thoroughly impressed! I have always been a fan of Lil' Kim and can truly say that this CD shows how much she has grown over the years; not just in age and maturity, but her rap style as well. While still using explicit language, she has toned it down a bit (at least I think so). She still raps about the things she rapped about before, however, she has found different ways to say them. Lil' Kim is back and better than ever!"
1,Progressive hip-hop for deep thinkers,"The Queen Bee delivers yet another epic masterpiece of astrophysics and philosophy. The cosmic rays gleaming from 20-inch rims and the Newtonian dynamics of Hummers are addressed in profound tales of bling blinging through the space-time continuum. Her collaboration with fellow theoretical physicist 50 Cent presents a powerful challenge to proponents of string theory -- dismissing the malleability of strings of quantized waves, the two suggest that the central theorem of the universe may be derived from stiff, elongated rods of energy. Overall, this effort is a leap forward for quantum physics. I highly recommend other brilliant treatises by her prestiged colleagues Lil Romeo, B2K, and the prolific P. Diddy."
5,La Bella Mafia,"THE BEST CD!!! The lyrics are awesome, Kim really worked hard on this album and you can tell when you listen to it. I would say La Bella Mafia is her best album."
2,Wack,"Lil Kim is [bad.] She cant rap, and shes just selling her image. I listened to this CD yesterday, the beats are pretty good, but if you want lyrics pick up 50 cent, freeway or fabolous, not this... Also, in terms of female rappers Trina and Foxy Brown are better.bottom line: dont waste the money!"
2,lil' kim fell off dramatically..,"lil' kim was at the top of her game when she came out with the classic rap album HARDCORE, and slipped a little on her 2nd disc NOTORIOUS K.I.M. but now she is repetative.... how many times do we have to hear her tell us that she is the boss in bed>?this lackluster only has a few songs on here that are able to keep interest:'thug luv' w/ twista'jump off' w/ mr. cheeks'magic stick' w/ 50 cent (and i hate 50)'can't f*** with queen bee'and surprisingly'shake ya bum bum' w/ lil' shaniceall the other songs make lil kim tiresome.... even the performance by Styles P is disapointing...what happend to the good female rappers like foxy brown, rah digga, trina, mc lyte, and eve>? they need to make a huge comeback and kick kim out of the so called rap game....kim needs a huge 'jump off' after this horrid album.."
2,Getting worse as the years progress......,"Although I enjoyed listening to Notorious KIM and Hardcore for a while, I don't really enjoy listening to this one. Her songs on this album don't reflect any originality nor any new recently-covered ground. The subject matter is much the same as in her previous album. And also, I'm so sick of listening to Lil'Kim bash Foxy Brown in her songs!! She needs to get over the fact that Foxy Brown is better and to just admit it. In conclusion, if you currently don't own any Lil Kim albums, you might as well just buy her debut ""Hardcore"" album because it represents Lil Kim when she first started out and it shows what little spec of creativity she might have had...even then."
4,This is def. her best to date,"All ye that have been hating on kim and her music must now cease and confess that the queen is still holding it tight in her reignthis to me is the best queen bee album to date. and all you haters can't help but step back, shut up and listen. the flow is tight and the beats are some of the best. this is def. what we've all been waiting for. you did it kim. much love for you.now if you don't have the album cop it now, or later you'll be wishing you had."
4,Kim did it again,"Yeah, this is one of the best albums to come this starting year 2003. Lil Kim has gone through hard times, but she has managed to make a very solid album. Guest appearances are on point (such as Twista, Styles P. and 50 Cent). There are some very good tracks like ""The Jump off"", ""Get in touch with us"", ""Thug Luv"", ""Magic stick"" and ""Came back for you"". Also the sensitive ""Heavenly father"" and the posse-track ""Tha beehive"" are good.All i can say is cop this album, it's worth your money."
4,if you dig kim this is your call,"yes she's back and yes she talks about sex, and she's still missing...biggie smalls while she even cops his own lyrics an yes she disses foxy, and eve as expected still if you like lil kim this is a must have as she gives you more of her sexy, raunchy lyrics."
4,Hott Ish...,I was never a big fan of Lil Kim but I was at the mall and saw the cd and I was like aight ill get it and i listened to it and im really feelin it... she shows true talent on this cd... everybody cop it...
1,Lil' Kim is a TRICKY one,"If you're thinking of buying this album for the track ""Magic Stick"" (featuring 50 cent), don't do it. The version we all heard on the radio contained samples and elements from Billy Squire's ""Stroke It"", while the album version sounds totally and completely different. The liner notes indicate the album version of ""Magic Stick"" contains samples and elements of a song called ""The Thrill Is Gone"" performed by B.B. King. Anyway, the only other song on here worth anybody's time is that ""The Jump Off"" (featuring Mr. Cheeks). And even that track has gone out of style pretty fast. Don't make the same mistake I did, go out and buy Billy Squire's Greatest Hits for that awesome guitar hook. Have a nice day!"
1,Leave the women bashing to the men...,"It's bad enough that male gangsta rappers refer to women as b*tch*s and h*'s, but for a female rapper to spew that about other women is worse than disgraceful, it's downright disgusting - just like this singer herself. And then to call herself a queen like she's better than other women in the world? I'd vomit, but she's not even worthy of my puke. Some advice to LITTLE Kim - get out of the recording studio since you can't carry a tune anyway, and spare us real women from your misogynistic garbage. FF--"
4,Both Notorious Kim and Hard Core on one album.,"One of the complex challenges of any Hip Hop artist today is trying to balance street credibility and commercial success. Lil Kim makes an valiant effort with her third outing ""Labella Mafia,"" and comes very close. Hip Hop heads will enjoy cut's like the seven minute long ""Behive,"" where Kims spits fire with her fellow Queen Bee Records affiliates. 50 Cent also lends a hand in helping the Queen regain her ""Hard Core"" roots on the sex driven ""Magic Stick."" The album does falter with tracks like the poorly R Kelly sampled ""Warning"" and the unnecessary ""Came Back for You."" However ""Labella Mafia"" is a great attempt at combining Kim's previous efforts into one album. It also displays her proven writing ability in The Notorious Big's absence, which should cast shame on those that ever doubted her."
4,Big Momma Queen Bee is doing it way big.,"I have all three of Kim's c.d.'s. Hard Core was her fantastic yet raunchy debut that everybody will always compare her future works to. I must have been one of the only ones who liked Notorious K.I.M. which was way cleaner than Hardcore, but anyway I thought La Bella Mafia was pretty good. She showed us that she can do it on her own, try new producers and sounds and still produce a good LP. I thought Lil kim butchered ""A woman's threat"" It was absolute utter garbage because she can't sing, but I LOVE the song with her and Twista, ""Thug Luv"" and the track with her and Styles is tight.I don't too much care for ""Magic Stick"" featuring 50 cent, although I like him as an artist. All in all she came back for us, while doing it way big. La Bella Mafia is worth your [money]."
3,La Bella Mafia~Lil' Kim,"I only liked a couple of songs on this cd, but considering that it's a couple years old I gave it a rating of 3 instead of 2."
2,Wasted Potential,"When Lil Kim came out with the classic ""Hardcore"", I thought it was the beginning of a great career. Boy, was I wrong!!! Kim is not only selling out, she is making ""bad"" music along the way, which is not helping her at all. Also, she repeats the same themes over and over again with her albums. The same topics about missing Biggie and hating Foxy is wearing on my ears and my nerves. I just wish she had that same hunger she had before, because she was awesome then. This will be the last time I buy another cd from her again without trying it out first."
1,Where is the Hardcore Kim??,"OK I know artists have growth in their careers but this CD is awful. I can't believe this is from the same woman who was in the Junior Mafia and put out Hardcore.I really feel like her nose job has hindered her flow and voice completely as in some songs she sounds like Angie Martinez.Worst Songs - Shake Ya Bum Bum, This Is A Warning, Basically tracks 1-15.Good Songs - I Came Back For You... this is the only good track on the whole album.I would only recommend this for die hard fans who only like her image and could care less about what tripe she puts out."
3,La Bella Mafia,"Ok First I think Lil Kim is back and she really is reppin Brooklyn hard. This Album is not what i expected of kim she could have done better. This album is mediocre the only hits on this album are ""The Jump Off,Magic Stick And Thug Luv. Everything else is either wack or alright. She could have done better I wouldn't recommend this album."
4,Much Better.. Cant wait for the comebacks from foxy and eve,"This cd is off da chain.. mainly tracks 8, and 10-16. Her flow is definatley alot more gangsta and back in the day when she first came out.. The best track is probably the one with missy. But with missy and eve coming out with an ""best of both worlds album"", one has to wonder.. will my girl missy get caught in the crossfire?"
3,Out of Range,"Overall, I'm disappointed with this album, which lacks cohesiveness, and doesn't adequately showcase Lil' Kim's talent as a rapper. In ""Magic Stick,"" Kim tests her vocal limits, reaching for notes that are too low for her. ""Can't F*** With Queen Bee"" uses guest artists to cover her thin singing voice; ""This Is a Warning"" overtly exposes her inabilty to deliver a tune smoothly. Most of the album is swamped with guest artists, and as a result, those tunes that spotlight Kim sound too spare. However, I still find myself sliding this guilty-pleasure album into the CD player when I'm in need of a Queen Bee fix, though I may skip a couple of the weaker tunes."
4,Lil' Kim's Back,"The CD is HOT! She is talking about she made it and ain't nobody gonna stop her. I took off a star 'cuz it wasn't as freaky as the first 2, but it's still blazin'. That's my girl cuz she keeps it real!"
2,Bad book binding,I bought this book for my 10year old son who'd lost his original copy. The first time he opened the cover the book came apart. The glue on the binding was still tacky. He and I were both very disappointed. Buyer beware.
3,Wow I still don't have it and I ordered it last month??,"So I can't really give a great review of this seeing is how I still don't have it. I ordered back at the first of january along with some other books by other sellers. I received those a week after ordering, this one i still have yet to get, because ups might have lost it thats what the seller told me thats bs. But I have read this book and it is super awesome, it has a lot of great stories, I recommend this book to all star wars comic fans just by it from someone else!"
1,This book is a waste of time,"Don't waste your money on this one, the publisher was wise in deciding not to continue to print it. The author could learn much about teaching from any of the Johnson Publshing student manuals at any CompUSA Training Center. There's very little ""How To"" in the book. The example ""Penultimate Videos"" is supposed to be a PowerPlant example, but try getting it to compile on a modern version of CodeWarrior. Even with the CW Pro 4 ""Update"", which I found only by digging through old newsgroup articles, it doesn't perform as advertised. If only Stephen Prata could be convinced to write a ""PowerPlant Primer Plus"", all us Mac devotees (and Apple) would be much better off."
2,Why?,"Tracks on this CD are mono where they appeared on the ""Electronically Rechanelled for Stereo"" vinyl release in TRUE stereo. For that reason alone, this CD is disappointing. The tracks that were in fake stereo on vinyl are also mono here. They obviously used the mono LP master for this release."
1,new Kindle Textbook format is AWFUL,"I have been using Kindle for my textbook for years. I have even recommended that people buy a Kindle for their textbooks. Now Kindle has decided that it would be a good idea to format their text book just like the actual book and make it only assessable from a computer or iPad. THIS IDEA SUCKS!I BOUGHT A KINDLE, I WANT TO USE MY KINDLE AND I WANT TEXT TO SPEECH, ESPECIALLY ON A TEXT BOOK!THE BOOK IS BASICALLY A SCANNED IN VERSION OF THE TEXT, IT LOOKS GREAT BUT I HAVE TO PAN ALL OVER THE PAGE TO READ THE TEXT. I LIKE NORMAL KINDLE TEXT CHOICES MCH BETTER.THE SIZE OF THE FILE IS SO CUMBERSOME THAT KINDLE CANNOT HANDLE IT WELL. ON AVERAGE, THE KINDLE PROGRAM FAILS ON ME 3-10 TIMES DURING A SINGLE READING. THIS HAS NEVER BEEN A PROBLEM BEFORE THESE NEW AND IMPROVED BOOKS.I do not recommend using these books. Buy a hardbound copy."
4,Reliable supplier,This was my first purchase at Amazon and it was a plesant experience. I received the book I needed in a timely manner. I would recommend this site for any future purchases anyone might have.
2,Condition of used text book was disappointing,The condition of this used text book was disappointing. Many of the pages were bent at the bottom edges. The price was too high for the physical condition.
4,Got what I expected,"Everything I expected. I didn't really need a perfect condition book, and this is perfect for me"
3,Criminology,"Fairly good condition, scratches on the CD but usable. It took a little too long to ship."
2,"Very Simple Book, A little too simple",This is a good book for the total beginner. You do not need any experience with any cad software.For the more experience users this book takes about 2 hours to read through and it covers the basics. But that is all.It does not cover anything more complex than drawing simple shapes. It does not cover references or relations at all.You will most likely need to buy another more comprehensive book.
3,Great compilation but missing better songs,"Edguy is one of the best power metal bands out there, most of their songs are awesome but seriously they needed to add some better songs on here but overall this isn't a bad compilation of edguy."
2,Cumbersosme,"Cumbersome to use, not too efficient, game selection just OK. Probably better solitaire games out there. I don't recommend it."
1,Not worth it,"I'm going to have to agree with the other guy who pointed out that this book has spelling errors in it. Beyond that, the information is not practical in a real world sort of way. The solutions are over-simplified and silly. You have to ""follow up and follow through."" Really?I also called all 3 phone numbers to the offices listed in the book and they are ALL DISCONNECTED!"
4,Good but small,"This is a great sanitizer for small items like pacifiers and rattles, but it doesn't really fit larger toys like stuffed animals. The reason it doesn't fit larger toys is that there are permanent dividers that limit what you can put in it. There is also no latch to keep the lid on so that larger, softer toys, like the Whoozit, will simply pop the lid off. That being said, it works great on small items (note that you cannot put items with electronic components in it). I used it to clean my twins' toys daily when my daughter had a stomach bug and my son never got it."
4,Great buy!,"I am a big fan of this sanitizer! I use it for my baby's pacifiers, toys, etc., at home, plus I bring home toys from our church nursery to sanitize in it. It's true that you can't fit big items in it, but I can squeeze a lot of stuff in. I would definitely buy it again."
1,Too small,"I'd give this machine 5 stars if #1)it wasn't so expensive and #2), it wasn't so darn small. It barely fits anything inside. It works well for pacifiers and a rattle or two, but that's about it. Anything else just won't fit. And the design of the inside, with the piece in the middle, makes it even more restricting. In my personal opinion, this product is not worth the money. I am so disappointed, because it sounded so perfect. But, its just not."
1,Won't fit pump parts or bottles,"I liked the concept, but somehow I missed the comments about how small this is or I could have saved myself some trouble. It won't even hold the 4-oz collection/bottle parts to my Medela pump. Info says you can use it for pump parts, but I guess that would have to be just the valves and maybe hoses - that still leaves me with the rest. Yes, pacifiers and a rattle would be fine, but not even the sassy rattle ball or arch toys would fit! Mine went straight back!"
4,Spending Time With God,"I haven't had a chcnce to read this book, since I am in a book study right now. I look forward to reading and studying this one. I hope it is as good as The Supplied Life.Mildred E."
3,Forward to publisher / author,"""Change Function"" has merit, archival, anecdotal. It is deficient is math formalism. Sales happen if buyer ""crisis"" surmounts ""total perceived pain of adoption."" Should be, f(crisis) > f(TPPA). Metcalf on networking quoted by author as n^2, where ""n"" is number of contacts. Where does this come from? If serial doubling (Markov), then 2^n; if combinatorial, then C2,n = n!/(n-2)!/2! = n(n-1)/2, almost n^2 with hand waving. Not sure there is much novelty here. Need is relative, need is buyer perception. Pros outweigh cons. ""Beauty is in the eyes of the beholder."" Rationale is rationalization. Wanted to direct comments to author / publisher but couldn't find email handle."
1,One of the worst business books ever written,"I got sucked in by the title--it is a good one. Unfortunately, the quality goes down from there.This book is just incredibly naive about product development in the technology industry. Suggesting that the primary mantra of technologists is, ""If we build it, they will come,"" the author (a self-proclaimed change expert) uses a mixture of 20/20 hindsight and shifting definitions to explain why a variety of stupid ideas (Webvan, satellite phones) failed. As to the success stories--like flat-panel TVs--people buy them because they're ""cool."" Thanks for the insight, Pip.I read this right after finishing ""The Long Tail""; a book that I expected to be a stretched-out version of a magazine article, that was surprisingly interesting and full of reasearch-driven insights. This is written more like a long, smarmy movie review. Unless you're marooned on a desert island with it, you'd be much better off re-reading, ""Crossing the Chasm."""
4,Cautionary Tales for High Tech Execs,"You have passion for your product, your team is energized and your investors are doubling down. Your potential customers are interested -- but they're not buying. Why?Change is painful. You may see your business in The Change Function's cautionary tales -- if you do, the change may have to come from your side of the equation."
3,Interesting but do not show the details,The Change Function: Why Some Technologies Take Off and Others Crash and BurnInteresting theory and well written book. Besides that it's hard to me figure out how to apply it to my business. Evaluations are qualitative and highly dependent of the assessor's knowledge. It requires a detailed guideline to be applicable on a company operation.
2,Alternative views available,"See Mud, Blood and Poppycock by Gordon Corrigan for a chapter with an interesting opposing view."
2,This Sucked...Period.,Talk about your horrible plot-lines..and lame acting.I think I'll find a way to lose this stinker at aneighbor's garage sale.
3,light hearted,"I have two of these, one works great and one doesn't. The one that works is in the attic. No motion and no windows, when I stick my head up, it comes on. The other is in the bathroom and it faces a window. I think motion outside (trees...) turns it on. It was forever coming on in the middle of the night. There are two lights in the bathroom, the motion detecting light has been turned off for four years. I guess it's time to replace it with a regular switch."
2,Not Durable,"I have installed two of these switches in my laundry room over the course of about 5 years. They are easy to install and work well but after about a year to a year and a half, they break. One just stopped working after a about a year and a half (I think the internal electronics fried) and the manual switch on the second one broke after about two years so it only works in ""Motion Activated"" mode.I got aggravated after having spent $40 a piece and called Leviton to make them aware of the problems I was having. Thier customer service rep (Sonya) didn't seem to care one bit about my problems with thier product.So..I will not be buying another. They must not be designed for ""high use"" rooms. I'll go back to a good old ""on/off"" switch. Thanks Leviton for taking my $80 and leaving me with two broken switches."
2,Yee Gads What Is This?,"Okay, I'll admit to the fact that this period of music is not of great interest to me. But, I decided to get it a chance. While beautifully sung and played, this is the most boring thing I have ever seen in my life. For over 2 hours the principle singers moved in slow motion most of the time with the arms and hands in statuesque like positions -- it literally put me to sleep! Maybe it was effective in theatre but it sure wasn't on video. If you want it for the music and singing I would highly recommend it -- but don't bother watching it."
2,buyer beware,"not stated anywhere on here, but there is only 1 mount. it's the mount i wanted, as i purchased a pair from radio shack before. however, who wants to order a single mount at this price? close to the price for a pair. i guess i should have known better. trick you when they can. totally not worth the time, effort, and especially the money. don't buy, unless you want to pay more for 1 mount, to mount 1 speaker."
2,Monica Shannon's story of a boy who wants to be a sculptor.,"This book for children is about a young boy living on a farm in Bulgaria in the 1920s or early 1930s. In a way it is a little unusual (at least it seemed that way to me) in that the first half of the book appeared to be written for 8 to 11 year-olds whereas the second half of the book, as the boy Dobry grows older and wishes to be a sculptor, seems to be written for an older child. But, the book won the 1935 Newbery Medal for best contribution to American children's literature, so I may be in the minority in my opinion."
1,Starts with a bang. Finishes a dud.,"I was very excited about this drive. I read many positive and enthusiastic reviews on it before I purchased. It was said to be the best and fastest for Windows Vista Ready Boost. Well, it was fast. I was pleased. For about 2 months. I noticed a slower response in my computer and was researching what to do about it. Then, one day, it just stopped working. End of story. I am not happy with it and do not recommend it. My daughter uses a Kingston and has about the same response time that the Apacer did, and she has been using it for about 9 months now."
3,expected something different,"The is a classic story and a great one, I'm not sure what I expected I guess, but I thought that somehow the ""sweetheart edition"" would be different from the original. the only difference is the cover"
4,Guess How much I love you,"'Guess How Much I Love You' is a beautiful book suitable for all ages. I bought it for my husband as a way to let him know my love for him is endless and unconditional, but the book would be lovely to give a child or a friend. The message is ageless and the illustrations are lovely."
1,Absolute Garbage,Run don't walk away from these shoes. Save your money and buy real leather or at least a better quality imitation leather. Purchased mine locally for half of amazons asking price and that was to much. Shoes feel comfortable but since I wore for only 10 minutes who knows. My issue is the fake leather which is a joke. It crinkles badly with 1st wear. Once marked up there is no undoing it. I really wanted to like these shoes since I got them cheap and loved the style. I don't post many reviews unless I'm extremely pleased or dissatisfied. I would recommend going to a store and checking these out before wasting your money.
1,"Nice styling, HORRIBLE quality","I purchased these shoes based on the great styling (in my opinion) and because they were on of the few offered in a 13W that I liked. I wore them daily in an office environment only. Most shoes I use for work last usually 2+ years and I replace them due to the soles becoming worn or losing shine, etc. Within a month of wearing these, the very fake leather began peeling off of the toe. I should have known buying a non leather upper shoe would cause wear faster, but for the light duty I put them through, this was absurd. The elastic on either sides of the tongue began unraveling within a week after that. Within 2 months, the sole had completely separated from the rest of the shoe starting from the front and going back about 3 inches. Never before had I seen a pair of shoes disintegrate so quickly.After several emails to Deer Stags' customer service went unanswered, I threw these shoes in the trash where they belong.I would not recommend these shoes to anyone."
2,Good design . . . .,"I was sold on the item by its design. The product could have been better with actual leather. Heck, even lower end leather would have been better than the 'pleather' material used."
4,Perfect for the curious literature student,"Basically a book explaining the best known Eliot poems line by line, this is despite the premise no ""York Notes"" book. It demands attention and dedication of the student, but it is worth the amount of time one puts into it. It aims at the undergraduate/graduate student (I could be wrong - having English as your second language inhibits you somewhat - so perhaps High School students in English-speaking countries could find it useful also) who is curious as to what Eliot's poetry ""means"" and of what material it is comprised..."
4,Aid to Eliot Comprehension,"I am a student, and had to present an explication of T.S. Eliot's _The Waste Land_. This work of Eliot's is entrenched in laborious detail that takes the reader from the text to the footnotes again and again. It becomes quite confusing and a bit irritating at times. This book, _The Selected Poems of T.S. Eliot_, was extremely helpful in that it construes Eliot's use of footnotes, and the allusions made within the work. It helps to clarify the questions lingering in the reader's mind, and allows for a more critical reading of the poem. I found it to be an insightful aid to my presentation, and would recommend it to anyone who desires an indepth study on any of Eliot's work."
5,"It's a play, not the movie.","The plays are more free form than canned movies.Since the actors get to ad lib, they're more believable.Crazy ..."
2,Meet the Browns,"Having viewed many of Tylers shows, I must admit that ""Meet the Browns""did NOT!!! prove to be as entertaining as the other shows. It seems as if the plot just could find its FEET.... or shall I say Madea just was not in the room and you really noticed her being missing.... The performers gave their best but Mr Brown just couldn't save the ""One man Show"". Strongly suggest viewing this show 1st on rental then Purchase...."
3,Great copy. Ok play.,"The play is not as good as the movie. But, I love Mr.Brown and Cora!!! And, that little girl can sing!!!"
2,Very disappointed,"I purchased this play because I am a big Madea fan. However, I was not impressed at all. I have all Tyler Perry plays and all were wonderfully funny. So, I purchased this one thinking I couldn't go wrong but boy was I mistaken. I was very disappointed. I think he was trying to hard to be funny but without Madea it wasn't working. He just did fo' much, not too much, he did fo' much."
3,Tyler Perry's 'Meet the Browns',"To Me this movie show's a greedy,gimmy,yo-yo- who wants only thinks of HIMSELF, and 'What will it get ME'"
2,If this is a play it should say it is a play.,"I have purchased 4 plays. I do not care for the plays. There is nothing saying this is a play, nor the others I ordered. Please if it is a movie say it is a movie, if it is a play, say it is a play. Thank you. The movies are Great!!!!!!!"
3,A LIL' BORING IN THE TUESDAY CLUB,"No Doubt Sheryl Crow's debut album is a classical Rock of the 90's must have, but in the middle of such success of such amazing singles releases like (Leaving Las Vegas, All I Wanna Do, Strong Enough), many songs fall in the state of being simply boring, and they're a lot like (Solidify, No One Said It Would Be Easy, We Do What We Can, I Shall Believe), it's not that their lyrics don't click, or say something, it's just that those song are not soul impact, somehow many songs like Run, Baby, Run, and What I Can Do For You...which were intl' singles, could have managed the radio airplay in the USA very well, but instead they give space to the meaningless Can't Cry Anymore, in conclution half the songs are stand out cuts but are lost in many filler tracks than run out the album and make it anoying and sleep maker at the end."
2,Not as strong as her subsequent CDs,A few good songs made great by her vocal performances but everything she's done since far exceeds this debut.
2,I like one song,"The song that got me hooked was ""Strong enough"". I heard it on the radio one day, and was compelled to listen more and more just to hear that song. Admittedly, Sheryl doesn't have the best voice out there; often she sounds strained on certain notes, and some of her melodies are strangely patterned. Still, her lyrics are something that many young, teenage-type lovers can relate to."
4,It gets better and better,Sheryl's other 2 albums sound so much better than this one. This album is good but some tracks are just plain down right horrible. Sheryl is a great talent but this album does not really showcase her talent.
3,Not the Sheryl we know & love today.,"I was not a Sheryl Crow fan until her second release. Songs such as ""Run Baby Run"", ""All I Wanna Do"", and ""Soldify"" are NOT Sheryl. It's the bozos from the 'Tuesday Night Club' that made her do those songs. Sheryl even said in an interview that she doen't want to be known for ""All I Wanna Do"". The best thing that ever happened to Sheryl was getting rid of the 'Tues' act. With that said, Sheryl does the most of what she can with fair material. ""Leaving Las Vegas"", ""Strong Enough"" and the heavy-bluesy tune ""I Shall Believe"" are high points of this release. And it sounds like the Sheryl we know and love today ! Her next two releases are by far, more superior than this debut cut. It's not a bad recording - but if you like this cd, you might want to beware of her next two releases. They are different, stronger, and more musically challenging than ""Tuesday Night Club""."
1,Anyone can be a star - and this is the proof!,"Simplistic, inane, childish, and lame. The highlight for me was the opening chord structure of ""All I Want To Do."" If you have this, demand your money back!"
3,Its all right,"I don't like much of the songs on this album except for singles and I Shall Believe, which was put into the Up Close and Personal Sndtrk. That song is the shining pearl of the album. It is so haunting and sadly beautiful you almost have to watch yourself because you know you're going to want to cry."
5,Might have been her best,"I have a couple of Miss Crows albums and this I think was the best one.You get the sense that there was a point to prove with the range of vocal challenges she was set.'Leaving Las Vagas', 'What I could do for you', 'Run baby run'all very different in tone and pace. Heavy rips and deep almost gravelly voice at times can give you the impression that she really enjoyed singing the songs and to me that has always enhanced my enjoyment.Don't miss this one, it was Sheryl at her very best with everything to prove and heart and soul were truely invested."
4,Not your average bar rock,"Sheryl shows a real talent on this first CD and has just got better and better from then on. The best songs here are Run Baby Run, Leaving Las Vegas, Strong Enough, Can't Cry Anymore,Solidify, What I Can Do For You, Na Na Song, All I Wanna Do, and I Shall Belive. I don't care for We Do What We Can, and No One Said It Would Be Easy because they get boring and are too slow. The rest bounce along. This is good rootsy rock and Sheryl's lyrics make you feel fustration, affection, and anger. It isn't as raw as her self-titled CD, or as consistent as The Globe Sessions, but it aims to please."
4,Great Songs,This CD is a collection of great songs by Sheryl Crow. She was great in concert in 1997 and I am looking forward to her next CD!
3,This is not the Sheryl Crow we know & love today...........,"I was not a Sheryl Crow fan until her second release. Songs such as ""Run Baby Run"", ""All I Wanna Do"", and ""Soldify"" are NOT Sheryl. It's the bozos from the 'Tuesday Night Club' that made her do those songs. Sheryl even said in an interview that she doen't want to be known for ""All I Wanna Do"". The best thing that ever happened to Sheryl was getting rid of the 'Tues' act.With that said, Sheryl does the most of what she can with fair material. ""Leaving Las Vegas"", ""Strong Enough"" and the heavy-bluesy tune ""I Shall Believe"" are high points of this release. And it sounds like the Sheryl we know and love today ! Her next two releases are by far, more superior than this debut cut. It's not a bad recording - but if you like this cd, you might want to beware of her next two releases. They are different, stronger, and more musically challenging than ""Tuesday Night Club""."
2,Just listen to the radio,"I never buy an album on the basis of one song. When I hear two I like, however, I consider it. I ended up with this album because I liked 'Leaving Las Vegas', and especially 'All I Wanna Do'. To my dismay, I found these two to be the only good songs on the album. The rest was either boring background music or just plain irritating. My interest in Sheryl Crow's music ended after listening to this album. On the basis of only two songs, I can't reccomend the album to anyone, but maybe the 'All I Wanna Do' single would be worth it."
1,some of the best songs released under her name,"Once upon a time, there was an actual Tuesday Night Music Club. It was a group of guys who jammed together for fun. Sheryl Crow came along and joined the group. They made more music together. Sheryl went on to fame and fortune. The others didn't. That's all I can type on this matter. It's up to you to fill in the blanks!"
1,Thirty Seconds is still too much,"Let's face it folks this is not a rock album that everyone believes it is. I will start by saying I didn't play the 30 second snippet for ""All I Want To Do"" because I knew it was already a lost cause, the rest were all just as bad. There are only 2 songs that may be a little bit o.k. and they are ""Can't Cry Anymore"", and ""We Do What We Can"". I just feel that this was a pop album all the way even though it has a rock edge don't be decieved. I don't know what she's like, or anything like that, but I do know she's beautiful, but while talented it's not the music I seek to listen to."
3,I was a little disappointed...,"... after listening to the cd. Although some musics are great, I think something is missing. I mean, it leaves you waiting for something more... Well, I enjoyed her 2nd cd much, much more. Its not that bad. Only thing is that it could be better."
3,More of a band album..,"This really should have been a ""band"" album. The majority of the songs are written with heavy weight songwriters (David Baerwald from David & David, the late Kevin Gilbert and producer Bill Bottrell). Sheryl does a credible job and the material is quite good.She hit her stride (and her second album was truly her solo debut)with The Globe Sessions. Not a bad first effort, but a little wanting in some areas."
3,Hmmmmm...,"Don't get me wrong, I love sheryl crow, her voice, her image, her songwritng' everything about her. But this CD is just not her best. The singles are mostly good; the rest sounds kinda boring and is mostly filler. Definintley not her best, but sheryl improved on her 2nd album;Sheryl Crow"
3,Rough Around The Edges,"There are some gems on this album, no doubt, but there are definitely some rough spots. One of Crow's popular songs from this CD, ""Leaving Las Vegas"" is really not that great of a recording. Compare it to the version that you hear on Live In Central Park, and you'll know what I mean. This CD also really sags in the middle with ""Na-Na Song"", ""No One Said It Would Be Easy"", and ""What I Can Do For You"". It would be the most die-hard of fans that can listen to this CD from start to finish.That being said, there are great songs on this CD the likes of which have not been repeated. The opening track ""Run Baby Run"" is rich with melancholy, and the bluesy ""We Do What We Can"" are some of Crow's finest songs. I've been listening to this songs for the last ten years, and I still haven't grown tired of them."
5,Omnimounts,Great product for mounting speakers! Omnimounts are the best design of several similar products on the market.
5,A real scare of a book,"Herein lies a fine collection of Ghost Stories. And it's not a barrage of cheesy tales of moans and groans in the attic. I devoured this book of shorts in one sitting. Highly recommended! Mary Higgins Clark's short story sets off the book in fine style, being the first in line. The only tale I'd say was missing from an otherwise great collection is Faulkner's ""A Rose for Emily"". Loved it!"
3,a fun read,"I bought both of the Lone Wolf trade paper backs and am quite pleased with them. The first is good, but The Language of Chaos is more fluent, and much more enjoyable to read. I wont spoil the plot too much, but it leaves a lot of room for violence, which is good or bad, however you look at it. For me, it's very good. The art is stunning most of the time, especialy the color and depth.I was also reffered to Lone Wolf and Cub by Kazuo Koike and Goseki Kojima through the forward in the Lone Wolf 2100 series. If you enjoy Lone Wolf 2100, you will enjoy Lone Wolf and Cub even more. It is a VERY long series, with 26 volumes i believe, but the story is very well written and alot of the subjects are even thought provoking.I give Lone Wolf 2100 3 stars because the main story line is rather bland, and not thought out as well as it could be. Even in spite of that, I would suggest you buy or atleast find this to read."
5,Great for the taking that next step,"I was a bit sceptical about this book. I thought anyone would be hard pressed to compete with Ben Forta's classic book, but this book is really aimed at a different target. If you are fairly new to ColdFusion and are looking at taking that next step into intermediate/advanced use of ColdFusion, then this is the right book for you.It introduces advanced concepts like using XML, new ColdFusion Components, Flash remoting, with clear easy to follow examples. Give it a look."
5,Solid Book,"I am new to ColdFusion although I have a background in Computer Science. I just started a project where I have to integrate ColdFusion MX , Flash MX, and XML. I found that this book provided a good overview of ColdFusion and was well written. My only complaint is that most of the chapters seemed not delve very deeply into more advanced concepts although there is an excellent and pretty deep coverage of how to work with XML and ColdFusion which was exactly what I needed."
5,Best smelling Vanilla ever,"This is the best smelling Vanilla I have smelled in a long, long time. My roommate wears it and now I have to buy it."
2,Disappointing,"There's an old Texan saying "" All hat and no cattle"". That's how I felt after reading this book. Who is the book written for? If you are an academic, there is too little empirical data. If you are a destination marketing professsional, there is hardly anything you can gain from reading this book. If you are a student, its too shallow. Nearly all chapters start out with a definition of branding by some marketing authority. Very repetitive. Philip Kotler's contribution on chapter 5 is OK, but outdated. Not one of his best. Better to get a book about branding. Chapter 5 does provide some value, as does the case study on Western Australia Chapter 12. Hence the two stars. Jim Kayalar is a Certified Management Consultant with the Institute of Management Consultants USA (IMC-USA) with 20 plus years of experience in a myriad of industries. Jim Kayalar is the managing director and founder of Business Tune Up."
4,Crictor...the boa constrictor. I like it. :-),"Do you ever like a book 'just because'? I can't make a comment on the witty prose or beautiful artwork to back up my heartfelt, ""I like it"" but I will try. It is an endearing tale about a snake. The storyline is nonsensical and fun--totally entertaining. The pen and ink drawings with lots of green coloring like the beloved title character are a perfect compliment to the story.If you want to go educational get out the maps and locate the 2 places that are mentioned in the story -- France & Africa. A sense of right & wrong alongside good character always strikes a chord with parents so Crictor is right on there. Whether an adult is reading aloud or an elementary student is reading independently, this book is sure to please.All things considered, I just like it. :-)"
2,Sophomore Slump,"Final Payments, Mary Gordon's first novel, and Men and Angels, are so extraordinary in their richness, complex and compelling characters, philosophical depth and control of language, that I can safely say Gordon is one of the most interesting writers working today. But this? Oh dear. Felicitas is a cliche, her involvement in the 60's leftest colegiate circle a cliche, her 70s single motherhood a cliche; the whole a mess. Skip this and buy a copy of Final Payments, probably one of the best first novels by an American writer in the 20th century. This is the dreaded Sophomore Slump at its slumpiest!"
4,easy to install,"when you try to install, you will have to kind of force the metal flange over the the end that connects to the garbuerator, then fit the black rubber gasket and it is ready to connect.For the other end thats hooks to the drain pipe I had to use a different gasket than the one provided(white colour).The gasket I used for the drain end has a bit of an angle and can slide over the pipe to form a good seal once you hand tighten the plastic nut connector.This tube was easy to install and saved me the big hassle of having to re-do all the plastic drain pipes to have them aligned properly.The thickness of the tube seems a bit on the thin side but time will tell if it leaks.I highly recommend this product."
4,Little Weight and easy to wear,"We love love this product! It is no longer being made (NOT due to recalls!!) but the Mijo is nearly the same. Light weight, easy and comfortable to wear! We have used it for 2 years now."
1,in need of recall,"My guess is that Amazon isn't offering this style due to a possible recall. Let me tell you that, although this product is nearly ideal for taking tikes on hikes, the quality is poor. My pack is about 7 years old & the straps have lost their integrity. Which is to say they are literally disintegrating."
5,Truly Brilliant,I must say I enjoyed the book thoroughly. It offers extremely interesting outlooks on the US government. Great job Tony.
2,I was expecting better,I have to agree with another reviewer about how this book has so much going on that the romance between the two main characters is overshadowed. I didn't like the way they even interacted with each other. I normally like it when the hero and heroine don't get along right off and then realize that they really love each other but these two just annoyed me. I wish I could rate this higher but I just can't. Hopefully her next book will be better.
5,"All I can say is ""Amen!""",I just want to add that all of the folks saying what terrific instrumental work this is are telling the absolute truth.I've over 70 FZ CDs ... and I say ... buy this and enjoy it!
4,An Interesting Artifact,"Recorded in 1972 at various venues this is a good documentaion of Zappa'a instumental jazz/rock big band of that period. On the plus side you hear different lesser know stuff much of which is improvised on the spot. Unfortunately the recording is only average and somewhat muddy, which is not surprising for that time. Still, if you are a Zappa fan it is definately worth getting this one."
3,Lots o' jammin',"I purchased this with the great expectation that this would turn out to be the live/on-stage stripped down version of the Grand Wazoo material. Well, folks, it ain't all that: While there are moments of compositional and performer brilliance in evidence here, there is also a lot of ""vamping"" (i.e., extended riffing on a pedal bass note, AKA ""jammin'""). Which is sometimes fine, especially when we're dealing with the caliber of musicianship here, but it often lacks the intense focus on composition that, in this reviewer's opinion, constitutes Frank Zappa's best work."
3,Enemy at the Gates,Exciting for the first half but became redundent as the plot progressed. And it was the Nazi's fighting the commies. I had no one to cheer for
5,OUTSTANDING!,This book is very revealing. It prooves those damned nazi's were devil's. It also points out the disgust whermact troops had for the nazi murder units. It is a brutal and serious read. Not for the feint of heart.
3,Not the Movie!,"WARNING: This book does NOT focus on the characters in the movie. They mention little about Zaitsev, which was a little dissapointing. It focuses on the ENTIRE battle of Stalingrad. I don't know why they call it the ""Movie-Tie-In"" just because it's the same title. If you're looking for screenplay novel I suggest War Of Rats. If you want to know more about the battle then this book is the best!"
2,What a 14 year old studying the Battle of Stalingrad thinks of this book:,"Enemy at the gates is a good book to read if you are a World War II scholar wishing to learn the full, in-depth extent of the battle of Stalingrad. To many others it will prove a challenging book to read. At times it is confusing and even the best reader's can only hope to drag themselves along the ragged plotline without any notes. Tieing in to the movie is not right - only about three pages of the book are even slightly similar to the movie. I was also disgusted to find that less than a half of the book was devoted to what I feel was the battle of Stalingrad, while the rest petered into the rather mundane account of the battle on the steppe both before and after the fact. I would only recommend this book to the worst of my enemies hoping that the drool from their bored eyeballs will damage the book and force them to pay for damages. Good day to you, you boring old scholar, William Craig. Logan 14"
2,Not the equal of Beevor's effort,"Vignette prose style leads to confusion among a large group of participants. Antony Beevor's account is significantly superior to this well-researched yet pedestrian effort. Only Cornelius Ryan mastered this style for WW II, in my opinion."
5,"Ranks at the top for authenticity, gripping!","Undoubtably one of the very best action WWII books I've read, and I've read a bunch. This book simply reads well, full of historical accuracy, and captivates the reader. War is awful, and all educated people who value freedom and liberty should be mindful of the pain and sacrifices of those who experience the hell we re-live due to not learning from history. Craig is a superb author."
5,Enemy at the Gates,"This is an easy to read book that anyone interested in WWII history would enjoy. A personal story of the battle of Stalingrad, it goes into great detail about the actual people who lived through the terrible conflict. You get to know the characters on both sides and while it's very honest about the tragedy of war, it's never gory or bloodthirsty in a graphic kind of way. Just the facts of this brutal conflict during a troubled time in the world 70 years ago. This book would be great compulsory reading for school kids in history classes wishing to hear the story of a great battle from both sides of the conflict."
4,Lincoln's War,"While I found the author's style a bit florid for a history and analysis book, I have enjoyed it nonetheless. His analysis of Lincoln's military genus has been describe in a more condensed way then Shelby Foote's ""The Civil War"", but in doing so brings it to the forefront of the readers attention. Great battles are reduced to a page or two, which may disappoint many readers who love the details of all the various military units and commanders. This book concentrates on how a lawyer from Illinois becomes, in the course of three years, one of the greatest military minds of the 19th century. One note that is bound to create controversy is the statement that U.S. Grant was the greatest general the United States ever produced. The R.E. Lee and T. Jackson fans are sure to be angry for that. I highly recommend buying this book and intend to purchase another as a gift for a dear friend."
1,style good; facts awful,The author's style is catchy; reminds me a bit of Fletcher Pratt. But there are errors of fact on almost every page! Save your money.
1,factual errors,Before buying this book you should read James McPherson's scathing review in the recent issue of The Nation concerning the multitude of factual errors which permeate this book.Caveat emptor.
2,Don't confuse me with the facts?,"I got this book cheap, fortunately, and read it before I saw the scathing reviews here and elsewhere. As I was reading I wasn't aware of the myriad alleged factual errors mentioned, but I was disturbed by the idiosyncratic writing style, an odd attempt to be ""folksy,"" I supposed. There were also passages which seemed abrupt and poorly edited. While the book was fairly easy to read and had some interesting things to say about Lincoln's role as military leader, I cannot recommend the book due to the apparent sloppy research and editing, and knowing there are undoubtedly much better works available. So I won't say don't read this book, but I will say don't spend any money on it!"
1,Burned Once ....,"Perret's knowledge of the Civil War is woefully lacking, as anyone who has read his biography of Ulysses S. Grant knows. I expect scholars will pick this volume apart as well."
3,A,"My school's bookstore didn't have this and I needed it for one of my classes. As it turned out, I didn't end up using it for my class at all. The book took longer than I was expecting to arrive, around two weeks or so. I bought it used and it was slightly more banged up than I was expecting. Other than that, no complaints."
5,"When you approach perfection, you touch on the divine.","This album is one of the most important pieces of recorded music, period. What's more, it is eminently listenable on many levels. It doesn't matter if you like Louis Armstrong, Justin Bieber, Mozart, the Grateful Dead, or Slayer for that matter -- you will love it and then some.Nothing needs to be added. Nothing needs to be taken away. The music just hangs there in the air around you as a sublime ethereal thing. Austerity and lushness in an extraordinary dance.Additionally, this particular remaster does a fine job of bringing life to these incredible performances. The soundstage is just right, and the levels are spot on. All good, and then some!"
5,Perfect,"This album is absolutely perfect. Although it is by now cliche to sing the praises of this album, it is truly a classic album that everyone should listen to. This music is simply unbelievable -- it is moving and catchy, and deep. Because the album stirs such deep emotions, it almost does it a disservice to reduce the experience of listening to it to words -- hence this rambling review. You have to trust these reviews and simply get it."
2,What am I not getting?,"I picked this up to try and expand my horizons in music and honestly this leaves me cold. The recording quality is stellar, the playing is great, yet the recordings themselves meander around with no direction... for 10 minutes, and then they end. I discern no cohesive melodies. I like jazz, or at least I thought I did, but aren't songs, even jazz songs, supposed to have some sort of patterns? I chalk the universal praise of this cd to mass hysteria and being too afraid to stand up and say, ""You know what? This is boring."" There seems like there should be dialogue going on, because this seems like background music from a movie. If you're trying to round out a collection, this could pass, but if this is your first taste of jazz head straight for the desert."
5,Kind of Fantastic,"Okay, what I want to know is, does it get any better than this? This is one of those ""jaw droppers"" where it just leaves you wondering how in the world did they come up with this? And the answer is, I feel, that they were ""not of this world"" when they did it...they couldn't have been! The music is too divinely inspired, too ethereal to just have been made by mere flesh and blood. Miles Davis doesn't just got soul, Soul's got Miles Davis. There are mournful lows, elated highs, tears of sorrow, tears of joy. This baby has it all! This recording will never die. As long as the earth keeps spinning in its orbit, this classic will be around long after we are all gone. If you aren't totally enchanted by this CD, you might want to go to a doctor and have him take your pulse. You could, just quite possibly be dead. Spend the [money]. It'll give you more than your money's worth!"
5,Ethereal,"If you are considering buying this album, I pray for your soul if you choose not to purchase it. Simply put, I pictured heaven as harps and angels before this album. But, as said, this album ""must have been made in heaven!"""
5,Cyclic,"I know nothing at all about jazz, modal or otherwise, but somebody recommended this to me and I like it a lot. It's a bit like Philip Glass, or environmental ambient music, in that it's a series of cyclic rhythms overlaid with soloing from various trumpets and saxophones. The music shifts slowly over the course of the album, and although there are six different pieces they are essentially one long whole. It's very, very minimalist, and although the sleeve says that it was recorded in 1959 it's completely timeless. Best of all, you can play it over and over again - the mixture of simplicity and complexity remains fascinating, and it's not so much a complete whole as a tiny snapshot of an potentially-infinite, continually-generated performance."
2,Dissapointed of the K2 format,"The CD has the sound that you used to hear on cassettes, this kind of shhshhshh. I did not expect that. I have a HiFi system that revealed right away the true quality of this CD. I have not idea whether it is related with this mastering or with the K2 mastering in general."
4,Miles Davis at his best,I purchased this album because I've heard that it's one of Miles Davis' best. After listening to it I agree. This is simply a great album.
5,Kind of Blue Review -- a Classic for everyone's collection!,Type your review in the space below:This music puts my co-workers to sleep. I like it.
5,Absolute Perfection!,"This is quite simply one of the best jazz albums ever created. Over the years I have collected several hundred albums by all different artists. I have a particular affection for trumpet, and especially for Miles.This album was the first ever given to me, and is the gold standard by which all other music I have ever heard or owned is judged. My collection started with this and since has turned into a runaway train.If I had to give up the rest of my music, I could survive for eternity with this album. There is nothing more to say, just listen."
5,Best sounding version ever of this great album!,"THE most interesting jazz sessions created by THE classic Miles lineup. This classic jazz album should be on every Top5 jazz album lists.What intrigues me most here is the fantastic sound of the SACD. I also have the previous gold CD version and a 70's repress LP, but the SACD version sounds so much better. It really feels like real instruments has entered my room. It's almost scary! I must admit I have a rather expensive stereo, and this SACD is one of the few digital records that really makes it worthwhile. How on earth was it possible to get a recording this good in 1959? The wind instruments are warm and with a wonderful timbre, but the most mindboggling is the dynamic drums and crystal clear cymbals. Hats off for Sony Columbia for a state-of-the-art remix and mastering!Should be mandatory in every SACD collection."
5,My favorite CD ever...,"...and I'm not even a real Jazz enthusiast.One of those Masterpieces that make you proud to be human. I listen to it when I'm happy, to amplify the mood, when I'm sad, to help temper it, and all the moods in between to add an always beatiful ambience to my crazy life...Enjoy."
5,Simply the best,"I didn't know a voiceless record could be so moving, so exciting, and so complete. Of all Jazz records I have listened to, I can honestly say it just doesn't get any better than this. I highly recommned this album for everyone, not just Jazz lovers, so get your hands on this album right now. In fact,I love this album so much that I might just go buy another copy!"
1,Technically the worst recording I own.,"I hope this poor review won't hurt Miles' reputation, but the distortion on this album is inexcusable. Columbia/Legacy ck64935"
1,Zero stars ! It will not play.,"This SACD will not play in any of my DVD or CD devices. Not the car, not the PC DVD Players. It will not play on the Sony CD & DVD players."
5,A masterpiece.,"I haven't actually purchased or listened through the entire album just yet. A friend of mine let me take a gander at his copy of the album so I could see if I would like to purchase my own. I have not gotten past of the first track, ""So What"". That song is a great piece of work. I keep listening to that track over and over. I love it. I'm sure I will love the rest of the album once I get to it. I will definately purchase this album. I would highly reccommend this to anyone."
4,Jazz for everyone,"Ok. So this is supposed to be THE Miles classic, THE jazz bible for the masses, THE miles album of all time. I doubt it,mass popularity means very little. Competent,yes, but not the most creative Miles album."
4,"yeah, but....","doesn't everyone who loves jazz / REAL music already have this in one format or another? just tune into any jazz radio station in any town, big or small...the most accessible miles and the most often heard. since forever. if you must, spend a little extra and get the gold/masterdisc series. far better sound... nice and airy.otherwise, find some other miles to open your musical soul."
1,Not for audiophiles,"If you are particular about what emanates from your speakers, don't bother. The standard re-mastered CD is as good and the original LP is markedly superior when played on a decent turntable with a better than average cartridge.Either this particular effort was poorly engineered or too much upfront quality was sacrificed to appease the gods of multi channel whiz bangs. The high end is over driven, the upper mid-range is muddy, and compared to the presence of the original LP, it sounds as if it were recorded in a cave. Al in all, a very poor example of super audio technology.Tone deaf"
5,What More to say?,"There is nothing to say about this album that has not been said. This album goes round and round, both when I play it and when it is in my carousel. This CD makes me happy, and will make you happy too. My mom even likes it, I put it on when she comes over to dinner. Endlessly cool."
5,You've GOT TO PROMISE,"to buy it if you don't own it and NOT to tell anyone that I just bought my copy a month ago.Don't get me wrong...not unfamiliar with the music at all and certainly not Miles! I just have a million unforgivable excuses why I didn't finally buy this. Trust me...jazz fan (Bill Evans fan), my head hangs oh so low with shame.I'm not sure if this is the cd with the dvd on the flipside--that's what I have and it really doesn't matter. I struggled through the watching just once listening to everyone being profound about ...Blue. No one needs to describe it...just to encourage you to have a copy, listen to it and see where it takes you. I guarantee it will take you to a good place!"
4,the cd was outstanding,kind of blue is a masterful talent of great jazz musicans. but miles gives better vibes when he is playing with marcus miller.
4,Miles the storyteller,This CD kicks. Listening to it is like listening to a masterful musical storyteller. Miles also told a great story in his autobio about shaving this chicks crotch before a gig. Now THAT is what I call class.
5,Simply Masterful! A must own album.,Truly the best Jazz album I have ever heard. You have to own this album. Great album to pick up if you are new to jazz.
2,both discs from LP- done poorly,"Fairly poor vinyl transfer. The turntable/cartridge was not properly set up and you can hear lots of anomalies. There are several other versions of this that are much better. You won't get the mono verion but, for me, it was so distracting that I got rid of the CD since I wouldn't listen to it. The music is still classic but the rating of 2 stars reflects the quality of this product."
2,"""Blue"" LP is scratched & scuffed when you open the box","Like other reviewers, I'm not focusing here on the music or the sound quality. I'm just adding my warning to the others. (I should have listened to them, but I thought ""mine will be different."" Ha!)So putting aside the music and the sound quality, DO buy this set if you don't mind purchasing brand-new LPs and CDs that are pre-scratched and pre-scuffed for you. DON'T buy this if you expect new merchandise to be, well, new."
3,"great concept, bad vinyl","Kind Of Blue is musically timeless. The concept of this package is terrific. Adding the studio outtakes was a nice touch. This record has been re-issued more times than one can imagine, so adding those extra tracks was long overdue. But the real reason for my comments is the disappointing quality of the vinyl LP. I just wish Sony/CBS had some quality control in terms of the blue vinyl LP. My first copy had bubbles which created bad pops and surface noise. I just received my replacement copy today and it is worse. More bubbles, pops and this one is warped. I hope can get another copy as easily. Maybe the third time it will be better.A note on the packing job by Amazon...the first one came well padded in the oversize box but the second one had no padding at all, just shrink-wrapped on a bigger piece of cardboard. An invitation to a problem."
2,Sounds like a CD to Vinyl transfer,"After eagerly unwrapping this release I was thoroughly underwhelmed when I threw it on the turntable. Bill Evans' piano sounded slightly muffled while Chamber's bass boomed and resonated with little definition. When Coltrane's tenor came in on 'So What' it totally obscured and overpowered the rhythm section. What gives?Upon further research, it appears many people believe this to be a homespun 'remaster' of an existing CD release which was then transferred to vinyl and I have to agree. Since the recording is now in the public domain, this is entirely plausible (and also explains the absence of the original cover art). I've been unable to track down any info about ""Jazz Wax Records"", which should probably tell you something.While not unlistenable, I can only see buying this record as a curiosity. If you are looking to experience something close to the original record, this release will leave you disappointed."
4,Model modal,"It is hard to fault something so obviously influential and well put together, but than again it's also hard not to hear what this blueprint established in thousands of recordings to follow, becoming lightly numb to it structurally, despite much warmth in the chemistry. KOB rightfully stands as a sort of ideal sound in lightly swinging, classic Jazz, but must be used sporadically for the most resonant effect."
5,One of the best recordings ever made,"This 180g version of Kind of Blue is my new reference disc. It is dead quiet on my system and truly taxes my gear. Imaging is great, allowing you to pin point where the individual musicians are. Cymbals sound great. This is a must buy for Miles Davis fans."
5,A Good Reason It's a Classic,"Great music, blues and jazz. Interesting history and a great perfect storm of genius and talent. Each contributor is a stand alone great and combined they are fantastic."
5,Are you kidding me?!?!?,"This is just awesome. I am hooked on Miles and jazz... what a great American treasure, the man and the music!"
3,"Groundbreaking, but not as interesting as decendents.","Up to 1959, despite it's seeming stately, calm form, it was revolutionary. It's just that later releases in early to mid-60's better provide in my listening experience a kind of compositional and performance related heft that lasts upon innumerable repeated listens. For instance, two notable albums are ""Blues and the Abstract Truth"" by Oliver Nelson and ""Nefertiti"" by Miles Davis.It must be said that Nefertiti is by far the most underrated album in history out of all music genres, and in fact, could be the penultimate statement in all of music, but, alas, the world is still not ready for that statement, some 45+ years later."
5,a must have,I am not worthy to review this perfect piece of jazz. Few musical CD's come close to this. A must have.
1,Over-rated and Pretentious,"Ok, sports fans! After hearing so many glowing reviews of this album and hearing it referred to as possibly the greatest jazz album ever made, I felt compelled to write this. It was about 20 years ago that I first heard this album, and found it to be boring. Everything is about the same tempo. I found Mr. Davis' playing to be laughable at best. Finally, it's irritating; and confusing that so many people laud it. DO NOT buy this album as a primer for jazz. It is very misleading to hail this as the ultimate representation of an art form that has had far superior accounts of itself. If any musician showed up on a gig sounding the way Davis did on this album, they would be fired in a heartbeat! If you want to learn jazz, start with Louis Armstrong, Charlie Parker, and Duke Ellington. I give ""Kind of Blue"" one star for Cannonball Adderly's and Bill Evans' efforts. Otherwise, it is feces hailed as something good-and it is with great effort that I've edited myself!"
1,Amazon doesn't tell me what songs are on the album. Why not?,Amazon becomes less customer friendly all the time. Give us some help
3,"one of the greatest, but this copy is flawed","This is probably my all-time favorite jazz album. Not only was it pathbreaking - an entire album based on a single theme as well as ""modal"" improvisation - but the artists are simply the best. Unfortunately, the transfer of this into digital format was not done very well: in the early tracks, Davis' horn is badly distorted with hiss. Thus, while the performance if 5 stars, the digitization is 1.I would not recommend this."
3,Fine Jazz,"While I enjoy this recording, I simply do not think that it ranks as one of the best jazz recordings. The musicians assembled are excellent, but the vibe is dampered and the solos seem uninspired. It seems as if the geniuses that were in the studio became bored with themselves- I trylu expected more of a spark- more spirit that thinking in this recording. This album is far too intellectual to be jazz- jazz needs its emotional base to rise through to truly great levels, and that is missing from Kind og Blue."
2,Hard to grasp,"I was handed Kind of Blue and was told, ""this will cd will change your life"". I'm a die hard Louis Armstrong, Bix Beiderbeck, etc. fan, but I couldn't grow to like this album.I thought maybe I needed to listen to the cd for a couple times to even begin to understand its sophistication or importance, but finally I gave up, and said this is not for me.I am not meaning to diminish the quality of this cd, for it appears that many hold it up high, but for me it was less than adequate."
3,"A really good album, but...","Generally acknowledged as the greatest jazz-album ever. That should be enough to make anyone suspicious, and I'm a suspicious bugger.IMHO this album has almost everything, the finest musicians ever assembled on one single album and great songs.Well, what's the problem? It has a tendancy to be dull and boring. It lacks the spontaneity so essential for good jazz-music. Calculated and cold are words that comes to my mind.It could have something to do with the production that gives the album this almost sterile quality."
4,"Good, but......","Miles Davis' Kind of Blue is definatly a record that pioneered cool jazz. But, after listening to it many times over and over again, I didn't feel ""enlightened"" like everyone else does. Miles put many interesting things into that album, but it carried NO EMOTION!! I think that albums like Sketches of Spain and Relaxin' deserve the 5 Star ratings."
4,miles,"The vinyl i purchased is actually a gift for my future son in law. he loves ""old school"" as he says. his collection includes alot of Dylan and Cash. He likes jazz, so i thought this a great gift. we will see."
5,Classic Miles,"This is one of the best, if not the best, classic jazz album(s) of all time. You're not a true jazz fan until you have purchased this particular album. I've studied this album well during my college years, and several years later, I still find that no other jazz album measures up to this greatness. Buy it and you will enjoy it. And, that's a guarantee. (I also recommend 'The Gentle Side of John Coltrane' and 'Love Supreme' by Coltrane and 'Joshua Redman Quartet: Spirit of the Moment, Live at the Village Vanguard' in addition to this album.)"
4,To Schenectady...,"Well, Mr. Schenectady, all I wanna say is ""Listen!"". This album, if you notice, is called ""Kind of Blue"": what were YOU expecting, ""Jimi Thing"" featuring Joe Satriani? For all I know, the walking bass lines and lazy swings DO contribute to the MOOD and COLOUR of this album, if I may say so. That doesn't, really, in any sense mean that you HAVE to like it. See, the Beastie Boys are the Beastie Boys, and no goddamn ""contemporary rap act"", with the blackest of the guys from the Bronx, can up the ante over those three guys doing their thing. I do listen to Eminem, but as far as the Beasties go, I'd sure opt for their gig than watch Marshall Mathers with some supposed hot-shot producer. It's about keeping it real when you have so many choices.But it's also about knowing, where, perhaps, songs like ""Typical Situation"" come from, thank you very much. I'd love to know your views on ""Sketches of Spain"", honest! Btw, have you ever tried The Yellowjackets?"
5,Disappointing!,"Ever since listening to this album for the first time years ago, I have real trouble finding any jazz that can compare. Sigh.... If you want to be disappointed by all future jazz albums you buy, by listening to the absolute BEST jazz recording ever, buy this at your own risk. If that risk is acceptable to you.... BUY IT NOW! You will melt the CD before it ever leaves your player. ;^)"
5,Beyond Comprehension!,"I don't know if Miles Davis knew it at the time but he made a masterpiece when he made Kind of Blue. It is a phenominal piece of music from beginning to end. I have listened to it many times and specially when doing work on my pc. This is music that really takes me away. Quick story: I have a friend who had never heard jazz before and I asked him if he did not mind me playing the cd. He agreed and I put it on, right off the bat he was hooked the same day he went and bought it and now he is a fan of jazz music. If that does not convince you that this cd is an absolute marvel then nothing will. peace."
5,Stranded on a Desert Island,"Kind Of BlueHow does one quantify the value of such a sound, or say when it's not appropriate? It just cannot be done. If I knew that I were to be stranded and could take a book, a DVD, and a CD, the book and the DVD would be all but impossible to decide up, and would ultimately be quite arbitrarily chosen amongst all of those that I love: the CD, Kind Of Blue, no doubt. This is music to drink scotch to on a night when there seems to be no one else in the universe. It is music to put on in the background as one writes, or as one reads Derrida or Lacan, or McCarthy or Borges. This is the album to take with one to one's exile with whatever book and DVD one takes. When I sit down and really listen to this CD I can imagine perfection. I can comprehend infinity's end. I can forget that life is brimming over with imperfection and that finitude will have the last say. Just wait until the last song is played."
5,A day off tomorrow!,"I haven't listened to this album for months. The last time I listened to it was sitting in my house with my good lady and my boy playing cards and drinking wine. Tonight I sat in my lounge with my good lady and my boy drinking wine and have now collapsed in a fit of ecstasy listening to this gem of mid-20th century art. There are times when one can get hung up on the formalities of daily existence, such as paying the bills via a day job or, simply getting up in the morning to pay those bills. I opt for the third option, which is listening to one of the finest six-pieces ever put together and being late for work! I'm thinking at this present point in time of having to turn the cd player off, be responsible and get enough sleep to survive a day working my ass off. I'm thinking what the hell, let's throw a sickie and have the day off and listen to this album all day tomorrow!"
5,A Classic,"Kind of Blue is a must have CD for any jazz fan or even for the casual listener. It is not only easy on the ears, but it is also a mini who's who of the greatest musicians of the 20th century.Eric Sutz"
3,Not one of my favorite by Miles,"I own about 25 Miles Davis cds, and Kind of Blue is perhaps my least favorite. It has a distant, cold, soul-less quality, like it was produced too well or something. It is too serious and tense. (I realize it is called ""Kind of Blue"" and maybe that's the point, but it's too dark). I am not saying the musicians are not great, or that the blowing isn't good. But this record lacks the spontaneity and the warmth that mark Miles' best stuff. I would much rather hear Cookin', Relaxin', and those other records from a few years prior"
5,BY FAR ONE OF THE BEST MILES DAVIS ALBUMS EVER!,"THIS ALBUM HAS IT ALL,COLTRANE,EVANS. IF YOU DO NOT OWN THIS ALBUM YOU MUST GET IT!"
5,"If you don't like this, then jazz isn't your thing","One of the best jazz albums of all time. And it's not simply because it's stacking a lot of great artists in there (Coltrane, Cannonball Adderley, Davis, etc)--there's a great flow throughout the album, and the synergy between the artists is readily evident. Each brings their own distinct flair to the table--if you're any fan of jazz this is a must-have. As an added bonus, it's also a very approachable album, cementing it as a timeless classic."
5,BREATHTAKING,"Excellent Jazz CD I bought this CD after listening to it on a display at a local record store. The first time I listened I fell in love with it. Just truly amazing between Coltrane,Adderley& Of course Miles' wispery trumpet playing. Also Coltrane's Saxaphone on cut #6 is just oustanding!-Worth the price-this is the best...5 stars!"
2,Aint Got No Sleeping Pills??!!....This'll Do Ya!!!-,"WOW!! I'm sure that there has got to be lots of music lovers like me who just dont see the attraction here. I tried three times to get with this disc, but all it does is make my eyelids heavy. Not terrible music, but nothing to rave about either - simply this music is lullabye stuff that conjures up a serenity which is great for unwinding, but not so great if your impulse is to stay awake. Sorry if I offend, but this is my honest opinion of this."
2,School assignment,"I bought this CD for an assignment for a Music Appreciation class. And that tells you what I know about the elements of music that make it good (or bad).My biggest gripe is that I can hear hiss and other noises that could/should have been removed when this was remastered.As for the music itelself, this is what I think of when I hear people talk about Jazz. But it sounds like every small Jazz band I hear at formal events. maybe they're all coppying this? But it is pleasant to listen to.Now how do I expand that into 3+ typed pages?"
4,Plenty of Miles,"Mr. Davis is a considerable talent and this album showcases some of his best work. A ""must"" for any jazz enthusiast."
5,Who am I to judge?,Humble me: do I have the cred to proclaim this the best record ever made? Every kid in the band should own this one. Might put stars in their eyes.
5,SUPERIOR TO ANYTHING OUT THERE,"There will NEVER be an album that tops Kind of Blue. Music has entered a virtual coma through ""talented"" young icons like Brittany Spears. Miles' vision is so wonderful on every track, it seems to be beyond jazz--in fact, when I listen to a jazz album by a different artist I find myself becoming irritable; soon Miles is back in there to soothe me again. It's amazing that, at the end of All Blues (track #4), he can perform an enthralling solo using a single note. I appreciate all of Miles' stages (and I love his fusion albums), but this is better than anything EVER. What more can I say? BUY IT NOW!"
1,DualDisc format has a DVD region protection?,"I am very dissapointed with this DualDisc, because there is no comment (worning) about DVD region protection. What can I do with this disc - region 1, in Europe (region 2)? My message for Sony Corporation is: ""This format will not exist for long with DVD region protection! Sorry."".My first, and last DualDisc. Back to the SACD!"
5,Kind of Blue: an excellent example of REAL jazz.,"When I first heard of Kind of Blue, I looked at the back. ""Man,"" I said. ""All these songs are really long. I don't have that kind of time!"" When I bought it, my whole view of all jazz changed. I now see that that 11 and a half minutes on All Blues isn't just a boring 11 and a half minute G7 C7 G7 D7#9 G7 song. It's a masterpiece, showing off everyone's talents. If you ever have a chance to get this CD, off this website or at your local mall, buy it. You won't regret it."
1,Totally boring Zzzzzzz,This is one of the worst albums I've ever bought. It's so boring and lifeless. Good to fall asleep to.
2,pointless meandering,"This is what happens when you have complete control of your music making but don't actually have any musical ideas. Davis was the epitome of self absorbtion and should be most famous for his opinion that ""white players can't play on the beat, they're always behind it."" And while apologists like Herbie Hancock might claim Davis didn't turn his back on the audience, ""he was conducting the band."" It's kind of hard to conduct when you're simultaneously playing your trumpet with your eyes closed. Maybe if his music equalled his legend then it would be easier to accept excuses for him."
1,puhleezzzzzzzzz.....zzzz.zzzzzzzzzzzz...........,"C'mon, this stuff is a drag! If you have to 'acquire' a taste for this stuff, then it hasn't hit you right off, which is what great music does. No waiting for the effect....great music says HELLO!!!.....not....Shhhhh.....it's time for sleep! One reviewer compared this to Dark Side of the Moon, but at least on DSOTM, Pink Floyd had the sense to add the alarm clocks to stir you. Closing time music for the droll and lifeless. One star out of pity!!!"
5,miles and miles of Miles,"Miles Davis's classic Jazz ""album"" remastered ................... perfect background music that seeps into every pore. One of those pieces of art that adds to the rich tapestry of life.100% * 10 out of 10 * 5 stars ..... simply the best"
5,Feeling a little blue?,"I'll keep it short and simple (As I'm writing this review there already exist almost 400 reviews for this album). If you know anything or want to know anything about music, buy this album. One of the greatest musical achievements of our time. You can't say enough about Miles Davis, and ""Kind of Blue"" is probably his finest ever. This was my first Davis album and remains my favorate. No excuses, if you consider yourself someone who loves music, buy this album now...right now, press the little button that says 'add to shopping cart.'"
5,Great piece of music,This album truly deserves to be a multi-platinum label. I have heard Davis's songs on the radio and elsewhere but this is one of his best works and I would recommend this to anyone who likes (or would like to check out) Jazz.
5,Ain't much better,"Bottom line:If you love this album, and you love someone, play this for them. This album has so much appeal. It's like the comsumate album for lovers. Enuf said. 10 stars!"
5,"5 stars for music, 3 for Sound Quality","This is one of the best albums of all time, VH1 even named it as one of the top 100 rock albums. Probably the best Jazz album, or top 5 because of people's personal bias towards their favorite Jazz musician. A must have for anyone's music colletion no matter what your tastes are.One bad thing about this cd is that the sound quality is not as good as other Jazz cd's. The album was first released in 1959, so you cannot expect the quality of a Jazz HDCD from the 2000. I still think they should have done a little bit better job when it came to the detail and background noise. Maybe I expected too much......anyways buy this cd it is greatA+"
5,Supreme emotion.,"I am not going to over indulge in this review of this timeless Jazz classic. Miles Davis needs no introduction. His music speaks for itself, and this is his masterwork. If you don't feel this, check your pulse..."
5,THE MOST INFLUENTIAL JAZZ ALBUM OF ALL TIME...,"...and possibly the greatest album ever recorded. The master of modern jazz, Miles Davis, rocked the music world with this smooth CD of beauty and glory. Each song takes a unique style, a special beat, and a sort of rhythm that leaves me humming for hours after I've heard it. Easily the best album in my music collection, ""Kind of Blue"" proves that jazz is alive and well, and that it will live on. Davis pours his heart and soul into his music, and the music will lift even the most downtrodden of spirits. Truly inspiring in all regards, this album is a MUST for all Davis lovers, for all jazz lovers, and certainly for all music lovers."
5,It really is that good,One of the few times when the hype surrounding a piece of music isn't hype. Anyone who cannot agree with the statment that jazz is an art form has not heard this album.
5,Great Knife,"I got this knife for my daughter (an aspiring chef) to use in her culinary classes and she boasts of how sharp it is, and of how she is envied by fellow classmates daily. I must warn that it is very sharp and you should be very careful and cautious when using it."
5,Wonderful followup to Dragon Prince,"High Prince Roelstra is dead, but Prince Rohan's world faces new threats from within and without as sorcerers, with powers identical and perhaps surpassing the Sunrunners, make their bid for power. A new generation rises to maturity as the children of Dragon Prince take their place in the world, and old characters meet their various fates.... A can't miss for fans of Dragon Prince and fantasy lovers."
4,A good novel,"I wanted to give it three stars because for a couple hundred pages in the middle it is extremely slow. However I've read it more than once and my cover is bent. That means I genuinely liked the novel.Rohan and Sioned have to deal with the challenges of ruling together, and the intrigue and drama grips you and won't let you go.For me this was the Dragon Prince's 'happily ever after' explored as being the continuing challenges of life. Rawn weaves a rich world with great characterization and political intrigue. If you liked volume one of the Dragon Prince, buy volume two. You won't go wrong."
3,Decent book but too long,"From what I have read of Melanie Rawn's books is that she is good at developing characters and provides good plots, but takes a little too much time describing how perfect and beautiful everyone is. Not everyone can be beautiful and perfect. The last 300 pages offer a really good story, but the first 400 is pretty annoying."
4,Wonderful series. But the Complete Collection is not closed captioned.,"I love the Doctor Finlay series. But I am disappointed that the series on DVD, including the Complete Collection, is not closed captioned."
5,Does what it is supposed to do!,I bought this to place on my matte black motorcycle helmet to increase nighttime visibility. Adheres well and is very reflective.
1,:P,"Not the actual thing, don't buy. This knock-off is a waste of your money, it isn't the slightest bit reflective."
2,Not very reflective,"I may have been expecting too much. I thought this would be reflective like the stripes on fire fighter jackets. It was not very reflective at all. I would not purchase it again. The quality was fine, just not very reflective."
4,Works fine.,Nice cheap reflective tape. It's kind of thick and plasticy feeling but it adheres well to smooth solid surfaces and reflects headlights fine.
3,Not as reflective as other 3M tape,"Based upon my experience with the Sayre brand Reflex Scotchlite Tape Strip which uses 3M Scotchlite Reflective material, I expected the 3M Scotchlite Reflective Tape to have similar reflective properties. In a side-by-side comparison the 3M tape is noticeably less reflective even when controlling for light source, angle of illumination, and angle of observation. This is surprising since according to the packages the same reflective material technology is being used in both products. Including an industry standard for measuring reflectivity would eliminate surprises like this. On the plus side the adhesive works well and the degree of reflectivity is acceptable but far from optimal."
1,Doesn't stay on. Reflects well though!,"I put a few strips of this tape on my bike, but after a few rain storms worth of riding they aren't there anymore!I guess I should join the cycling-ninja gang now!"
2,Disappointing,"For a 3M product, this one was pretty disappointing.First, it just did not stick at all to my surface. Considering that 3M makes the most aggressive glues in the world, I have to consider this a design defect.Second, it is reflective only head-on. I needed it visible at an angle, and it is just plain invisible at an angle.The pieces that had not fallen off, I tossed, and replaced with standard retro-reflectors and real glue."
3,Not Quite Sliver Reflective,"Just purchased this item. It adheres great to my backpack, but the color is white reflective not silver. I own fitness apparel such as New Balance shirts and Nike sneakers with silver reflective stripes and that is much more reflective than this product. The matte silver on my fitness apparel items pop and shine brightly, but this glossy tape partly reflects due to it's glossiness, and has just a bit of reflective qualities. I tested both at the same time on the streets of NYC where there are lots of moving cars and I was a bit disappointed with this 3M tape."
1,tape peels off,I purchased this product to place on a nylon dog leash. The tape started peeling off after the first walk. The flexiblity needed in the tape for the movement of the leash is not there. Do not purchase with the intent of using on anything that will be bent frequently.
1,NOT reflective!!! Don't waste your money!,"See title...Very disappointing. The best and worse thing about the tape is the same - it's very adhesive, but since it's not reflective it's worthless and now I can't get the worthless tape off my motorcycle panniers!!"
1,quite disappointed,"purchased it on 2012-06.Unfortunately i don't see any reflection effect.(checked during night, evening, day etc.. but no use)"
1,DECIVED,THOUGHT I WAS GETTING A ROLL OF THIS TAPE WE WERE GOING TO PUT ON MACK OF KIDS COSTUMES AND ITS PROBLEY 12 INCHES LONG
4,Part of a wonderful series,"The monsters of mythology are often flat and cardboard in tellings of their stories, being always evil, bloodthirsty, etc. However, Bernard Evslin wrote this cool series where he fleshed out each monster and made them more real, giving them personalities and motives for their deeds.This book is no exception, and the Minotaur becomes a sympathetic character, born out of the gods' punishment towards an arrogant queen. Minotaur even becomes friends with his half-sister (the Princess) and he is actually an likeable character, so you can't help but feel bad for him when the inevitable happens and Theseus comes to the labyrinth."
5,The Heart Released,"Carol Hebald's brave and honest memoir is one of the best memoirs I have read. Her words affected me deeply on many levels, and her struggle and triumph both are a testimonial to what it means to be human. Her voice, powerful and compelling, must be heard. Her insistence on living her life honestly and with dignity, her will, and her courage are inspiring for any reader. I read the memoir in one sitting, unable to put it down, and I will recommend it to my students, to my friends, and to anyone who will listen as a work which must be read. I have also read Ms. Hebald's collection of poetry ""Spinster by the Sea"" which is also a testament not only to what she has to say but also to the skill and beauty with which she says it."
1,long and boring,"This is a book of adolescent confusion from a borderline personality, does not have a literary value.She describes the consequences of her sexual abuse at young age but it is repetitious and pointless. I do agree, it is a story of author's mental illness, in a form of a semi-journal, but I don't understand why it made it into a publication."
2,Deadman's Canyon,This story is medicore compared to the hundreds of western books I have read. The story is very predictable.
4,"This a great deal, for fans of the show","I happen to really like the show, so I am biased. But, I bought the singles dvds for over $100 so this is a great deal. This season the production values were so much better than season 1 and it shows, a lot more action, most of it, took place away from sanctuary. They all start to grow in their powers which reveals a dark side to Emma, and Brennan acts like a petulant teenager and questions and confronts Adam on everything. Fans, be sure to check out episodes 201, 205, 206,218, 220. The ""Inferno"" episode is truly the best.Buy it you won't be disappointed."
5,i cant believe they ended it!,"mutant x is one of the best shows around i cant believe they ended it on a cliff hanger and never made any more. i think season 2 is a really good season as it shows when ashlock gets into shalimars head, which is really interesting to see."
5,Mutants,This is the explosive second season of a very well studied sci-fi tv serie: a perfect cast and a very balanced use of special effect without forgetting to explore the personality of each component of this wonderful group! we want a fourth season please!!!
5,Rev Andrew Hogarth,"This is a classic. Our whole church have used it, Ive preached using its titles and the content, humility and graciousness of this book has been a ""game changer"" for myself, our leaders and our church. If you read ONE book on prayer, I suggest you read this one."
3,Fairly good..,2 1/2 stars really.. I was really impressed with about a quater of this guide to prayer. The rest was kinda dry/wordy.
5,Helpful Insight from Too Busy Not to Pray,"This book is easily understood by people new to Christianity but also offers both helpful insight and hints for those at any level in their Christian walk. What I have found to be particularly beneficial has been the ACTS method of praying (Adoration, Confession, Thanksgiving, and Supplication). I have found that the pattern helps me to focus."
2,I wanted to like it,"Voluntary simplicity has some features to it that would benefit most people in the United States, and that I am actively trying to incorporate into my own life. These include less consumerism/materialism, financial ""modesty"" (for lack of a better term), less cluttered living, etc. When we speak of the priorities, however, we must not forget the ""voluntary"" aspect.I can sum up my problem with this book with a single quote from page 170, ""Simplicity is not about imposing beliefs on others or judging their actions... except, of course, by enacting and enforcing laws that mandate..."" Throughout the book, every topic ends up with a discussion of how to tax, fine, or otherwise manipulate and coerce people into adopting the practices that the author believes would be best for them.This sanctimonious, condescending attitude was so offensive that I found it difficult to draw anything positive from the book."
3,Simplicity Lessons: A 12-step Guide to Living Simply,This was a gift on a Amazon Wish List so I know very little about it except the receiver was very happy to receive it.
3,Interesting--Three and a Half.,"This is a fairly short book. Some characters and situations remain underdeveloped, which is a negative since I enjoy Sheila Bishop's ability to create realistic people and relationships for its own sake. However, the mystery is suspenseful. I could hardly put the book down until it was solved. Ms Bishop is also clever at turning around our perceptions of one character. This doesn't always work for me, but in this case she won my sympathy for ""Richard III."""
1,OLD product,01-27-03:You can get the USB 2.0 version for 59.99 at CompUsa and many other places. So spending 62 bucks for the older slower technology is just silly. USB 2.0 is 10-40 times faster.
4,Know it !,"This album constitutes a nice hour of modern jazz from drummer Victor Lewis, who wrote the majority of the tracks on this CD. Trumpetist Eddie Henderson doesn't play on all tracks, and it's a pity, because he's really cooking ! This album is the first recording for Canadian saxophonist Seamus Blake, but he doesn't seem at all timid. He has a great sound, and he fits the tunes well. Pianist Eduardo Simon is classy and tasteful, and bassist Christian McBride forms a perfect partner for Victor Lewis. (P.S. This album is NOT a live recording !)"
5,Biblical Truth Uncovered,"There's nothing like the doctrine of God's sovereignty that can cause a man to be humble and yet at the same time confident of his salvation. When I first read this book, I must admit that I found it hard to accept the doctrine of calvinism. Like many Christians in the charismatic churches, I was taught that I could lose my salavation, that Jesus Christ died for every person, and that free-will triumphs over God's sovereign will. Even so, this precious book has made me reconsidered my arminian beliefs until finally I began to see that salvation is from the Lord from the beginning to the end. How God has caused this book to impact my spiritual life is beyond measure to me. My whole outlook of life has changed dramatically, now that I know that He is in control of my life and my salvation. To Him alone then, be all the glory."
1,Which God???,"Pink does a wonderful job casting light on a key part of God's nature...unfutunately the god he describes is Allah, not the God of the Bible."
3,Contents excellent. Kindle edition terrible.,"You get what you pay for. I was excited to get this great text for my Kindle. But alas, there is no active TOC. So I went to the cover from menu and paged forward - still no TOC. Until someone comes out with a worthy Kindle edition for this beautiful book stay with the text format."
5,Awesome book,"I have studied this book twice so far, almost 15 years apart. Both readings strengthened my faith in God and encouraged me through tough times. It was written for tough times, when people are struggling with pain and suffering, fear and doubts about God's role on earth. It's not so much written about us, it's written about God, and it convicts us and reminds us of who God is and has to be, or He wouldn't be God, someone or something else would be. It can be a hard truth, but it is a neccesary truth for His own to gain strength and security. Read the book if you need help or want to help someone else."
1,"Review of ""Humble's"" review","This is not a review of the product, but of the reviewer named Humble. Don't fall for trying to get a $500 Amazon gift card for free. There is no such thing as a free lunch. I tried to respond to the offers, and did actually find some I was interested in. You have to choose two from the Silver Level, two from the Gold Level and two from the Platinum Level. Well, guess what, nothing interested me at the Platinum Level. Two of them were for auto loans, which had to be approved and funded in order to get your ""free"" Amazon.com gift card. The third one was something about increasing your cash flow. I learned my lesson, never again will I try to respond to any offer for a ""free"" gift card."
4,Beautiful but....,"My sheets arrived and they looked GORGEOUS! They felt gorgeous. They are very large which I like alot. By that I mean, I have a King size bed with the big thick pillow top and often I buy sheets and it seems like I have to fight with them to get them onto the bed. These have room to spare and then some. My only complaint is after you wash and dry them...get them out of the dryer immediately and fold them. They wrinkle badly, and I mean really badly. Dumby me didnt read the cover on them so I dont know if they required ironing or not, in my opinion they definatly do."
5,Sleeping on a cloud in the sky,"Outstanding, comfortable, beautiful and soft sheets! And the price was incredible. I am so happy with this purchase. Thanks so very much - it's nice to get your money's worth and this was truly a pleasant surprise...Bonnie"
4,Nice Sheets!,For the price even with shipping the sheets are a great value. Under 30.00 for 300 thread count sheets! I am loving them!
2,wrinkles!!!!!!!!!!!,"The sheets were very pretty when they arrived. However, after washing them for the first time I freaked! I am a person that takes clothes out of the dryer before it stops to avoid wrinkles. These sheets were so badly wrinkled I actually had to iron them before puting them on the bed. A great disappointment as I hate to iron!!!!!"
1,Leaks like a sieve!,I was very disappointed with this jug. I thought with the Coleman name it would be better made but the lid doesn't seal and it leaked in my car. Not only does it leak from the seal around the lid but the flapper that snaps down over the mouth piece doesn't seal either. I'd send it back but it isn't worth the shipping cost!
2,A let down,"Holds fluid fine, handle keeps coming off! Also wish it had a real handle on the side, had one before that did, is a great feature."
3,"good, but the top lid is too thin...","the size is ok for my kids to bring cold water to their game, but the top lid is too thin..."
1,Don't waste your money,"What a piece of junk. Only after you adjust the brightness and contrast to the limit, can you make out a faint image. The manual is a joke. I tried to contact Jwin customer service and got no response. Do not waste your money."
1,Ruined a good thing.,"My 4-year old loves Scooby Doo. One of the great things about the franchise (at least the part I've been acquainted with) is that the mystery spook is invariably unmasked at the end of the show (or book). Not this time. Real zombies, real magic. Not the message I was looking for."
5,"""This CD is Da Bomb,You'll LOVE it""",Once you hear them you will do anything to meet them.Trust me you'll probably save your money to go to a concert.(by Rhyne Redula)
5,Great Album!!!,"One of the best albums I own!!! My fave song is Castles In The Air, I hope B*Witched will release it after 'Blame It On The Weatherman'. :)"
5,Cool!,This is just totally amazing. They have such a nice harmony. If you don't like this CD you are pretty dumb.(or just have bad taste)
4,B*Witching.....at its best,"This was a catchy, teenybopper CD. Not to say that I didn't like it. Fun and fresh tunes make this CD a pleasure to listen to. Though these girls may seem a bit fake, their light, almost dreamlike voices collaborate to make this a very enjoyable recording."
3,Poppy,"I think that B*witched didnt really have to make it considering they had a brother in Boyzone and a sister in law in Eternal. All they had to do was appear on the Pop Scene. Their songs are ok but a bit poppy and babish. Their lyrics arent so hot either I mean ""Blame it on the Weatherman"" Roseanne Leddy, Lismore Ireland. P. S I live in Ireland and believe me they are not Cool or ""in"" over here"
5,Clearing something up...,"They are NOT the Spice Girls, All Saints, or a girl version of BSB or N'Sync. They are ORIGINAL. K? Now that that's straight~ *""C'est La Vie"" means ""That's Life"" in french. *The lyrics are not perverted unless you are. *They're Irish. They include Irish jigs in their music and dance routines. If you have a problem with that, then...well, it's your problem. *The songs are upbeat and can be danced to very easily. I excercise to them nearly every night, and I'm considering getting a group together to dance to it in my school's Variety Show. *B*Witched is a great name. You try and think of a better one. And just for fun~ Step aerobics make great dance moves to the Irish parts of the CD, if done quick and without the step. **:)"
3,"OK, could be better",This CD has a few good songs. I like C'est LA Vive alot. I thought it would be better than it is. They copied the Spice Girls.
2,A FLASH IN THE PAN,"What have they done for us lately? Just imagine; 20 years from now, they'll be doing the ""has-been"" geek shows with their male counterparts ""The Hansons"". How embarrasing!"
1,They Make The Spice Girls come across as if they have Talent,B'Witched needs to make those voices Vanish.The Music is super chessy&who is Writting the songs?this is so bad that they make The Spice Girls Look as though they have Actual Talent.
2,An OK CD,"The good news: this CD has ""C'est la Vie"" and ""Rollercoaster"". The bad news: most of the other songs aren't so hot. True, ""Blame it on the Weatherman"" is good too, but that's about it. So, is it worth getting the CD? I personally think so... can never have too much of a good thing, and SOME of the songs are good, after all! So ultimately, do you want to play about $ for a few good songs? I'm not saying whether you should or shouldn't... that is completely up to you."
1,This cd sucks,this cd...! Please don't buy it. My sister loves it and acciendantly put it my cd plyer. Wow this cd stinks then again maybe your into this kind of music. in case you are you should save your money. Download the music or find some other pathetic loser and burn their's
1,Terrible,Okay at first I loved this Cd but now I think this is the worst cd I have ever heard personly I would buy Smash Mouth or Britney Spears but I would not spend forteen dollars on this cd
5,Ces't La Vie is THE BEST SONG!!!,I heard this song for the first time on the radio and I can't wait to buy the CD. I love the songs on this CD just 'cause they're so different. B'WITCHED IS DA BOMB!!!!!
5,Get over it guyz! It's Good!,"Hi! I am a huge fan of B*Witched. My favorite people are Kevie & Adele! I mean,no offence to Shanade & Lindsey. My favorite songs by them are, Rollercoaster,We Four Girls, & C'est la vie. My french teacher TOLD me C'est=It's La=Th and Vie=Life. And also to 1 person who wrote a review, You probbley don't own the CD if you called the Subject: SAY la Vie. I think you have just heard the song,no offence.I personaly HATE the Spice Girls,N'Sync,Backstreet Boys,and stuff lie that. I normally listen to The Offspring,Hole,Korn,Green Day, Everclear,Eminem,Blur, and stuff like that, but I except Brittney Spears,Sixpence Non the Richer, and B*Witched.Thanx for reading! Au-revior!"
5,Best Band of the Year!,"I'm just gonna review the songs here...Let's Go: 4/5 Not Bad for an intro. but should have kept beginning part of it instead.Ces't La Vie: 5/5 Nothing wrong with this song. Good lyrics, good sound, ties for first on the album.Rev It Up: 3/5 This song just gets on my nerves. Don't ask me why.To You I Belong: 4.5/5 Sweet, but doesn't have that final zest to it.Rollercoaster: 5/5 Reminds me of DisneyWorld but I really like it. Second place.We Four Girls: 3/5 Just doesn't work out.Castles In the Air: 5/5 Ties for first. This is my favorite though, it has the zest that To You I Belong doesn't have. The solo: So softly like a sigh Sea where the white horses ride It all seemed so real A feeling deep inside So our time will go onFreak Out: 3/5 Not that good.Like The Rose: 4.5/5 Kinda like To You I Belong, but good.Never Giving Up: 4/5 The better version of Rev It Up.Oh Mr. Postman: 5/5 Good finale. Though they should have taken out the male vocals at the end."
4,If you like to dance and sing a long...,get this cd! I love how B*witched has a varied taste in their music. I love all their songs. They actually have talent. That can proven if you watch them peform. I love how they co wrote it with their producer. They also have that sense where they're carefree. They have a positive message and I think that's important. I drive my parents crazy playing this ablum day and night but at least it's something my mom sings along too and not something that will make neighbors complain. I think the girls have a style all their own and they're not trying to be fake.
2,More like 2 1/2 stars,"My rating is somewhere between 2 and 3 stars. 2, I assume to mean barely tolarble and 3 meaning your average ""okay"" CD. While I bought this CD for a friend, I was subject to listen to it with her the first couple of weeks she had it. Overall, the pinched lead vocals get really annoying after awhile. ""C'est La Vie"" is down right unlistenable after hearing it about 3 times. Even my friend, whom I bought it for, stopped listening to it admitting she's glad she got it for a gift rather than to have bought it. However, the CD isn't totally horrible. ""Blame It on the Weahterman"" is actually quite nice. That song, plus about 1 or 2 others is the only reason I give this CD any stars. Otherwise, it's mindless manufactured bubble gum pop that too sweet to tolerate."
2,School Play,"In sixth grade, I probably would've loved this stuff. They are so amateurish and repetitive, it is hard to endorse as real music. Sounds like bad candy commercials. I'm really not this mean."
1,Evil little Spice Girls wannabes!!!,I hate them!!! They are just so tacky!!! Their music and clothes are so disgusting to the point that it's not even funny!!! Riverdance rejects.
4,This is a good CD with a lot of variety,"This CD is great because it has a lot of variety. I'm a 17 yr/old male and I think that they sing well and they're clean. IMAGINGE THAT! A group that doesn't scream instead of sing, who have pep, and doesn't have lewd and offensive lyrics; that is why I like this group. Some songs may seem similar, but the rest of the songs are really varied. If you like uplifting, energetic songs with nothing objectionable, then get this CD."
4,Great songs,"Bwitched is a great group and a great cd! Blame it on the Weatherman is by far my favorite song. Edele Lynch, the lead singer, has a great voice and the other girls seem like her backup singers. I don't really like that but I guess they dd that for a reason. I thought these girls were going to make it big. They got a lot of publicity from their concert on the Disney channel, but they have seemed to disapear. Whats up with that?"
5,I think this CD was on of the best girl groups I have heard!,"I think this CD is Rocken and it's the bomb, it is 155 times better than the Spice Girls or any other girl group. The girls (B*Witched) have a great beat and grove to show off how good they dance. I saw them with 102.7 kiss fm and that was the first time I heard them and from there on I loved the and I can't wait intell there CD comes out and I can listen to them all the time."
5,Catchy and sweet!,"I don't know what possessed those other people to be so hard on this group, but I think they're really cute! I just bought the ""C'est la vie"" single and even though it may be power pop to the tenth degree, it's still really catchy and easy to dance to. They kind of have a Spice Girls flavor, and the song is hummable in the car and everywhere else. I don't find them perverted in the least, because their song has a playful aura about it, and all they're doing is teasing. If you like pure girly pop, I recommend them because they're just so gosh darn adorable!"
4,Come on we're riding in a rollercoaster of love...,"The B*witched girls bring it like the Djoker did to Ferrer at the Aussie Open on 1/23/13. This CD has 2 cool songs and plenty of junk tracks. Definately a great CD to rock in your 2003 Chevy with the Sunroof open pretending like you're 18 and aboot to smash out C-Lynn again.Worth getting from your local liberry and then blasting on your iPod when you're riding your 1970s Schwinn exercise bike in your townhouse.COmeo on, we're riding in a roller coaster.Go Djokoer, beat either Andy the Clown or Old Man Fed on Sunday."
4,One of My First Albums,"It was in 90's when I was interested in Spice Girls and other girl bands. Spice Girls was my number one girl band but B*Witched was in the second place. This album is very positive, it has a lot of girl pop energy. Most of the people have heard the songs ""C'est La Vie"", ""Rollercoaster"", and ""Blame It on the Weatherman"" because they were played in radios very often. This album is great, and will remain in top10 girl band pop albums of all time, at least in my list. This is their best album...it makes me happy!Stars: C'est La Vie, We Four Girls, Blame It on the Weatherman"
5,The c.d. is the BEST EVER!!!,"This c.d. is creative with great tunes, it is fun to listen and dance to, the four girls are the coolest!!! Edele, Sinead, Keavy, and Lindsay, you guys are the best!"
5,An excellent recording is a great way to reach the zenith.,"B*Witched is an excellent group. They are and aren't like the Spice Girls. I mean, the Spice Girls had all those songs didn't make any since-about 0%. Then this group called B*Witched comes in and takes over-the right way. They have songs that acually make since and they are great. Some are my favorites are ""C'est La Vie"", ""To You I Belong"", ""Blame It On the Weatherman"", and ""We Four Girls"". They are are awesome and so is the group. I hope they will continue producing many more excellent songs..."
5,Great! Fantastic! Always in my stereo!,"This CD was great! Whenever I'm feeling really sad, I listen to this CD or their othe rone, and I feel 8 times better..all the songs are totally aceable, even the slow ones...my faves are C'est La Vie and Never Givin up and Rev it up and Rollercaser"
4,"a fun loving cd, with a great selection of music","This CD,is a wonderful fun-loving cd.C~la vie is the most popular song, now.It has an irish twist to it.The words are easy to learn, and cool to sing.This CD is for anyone who likes to have fun."
3,It was cute,"It was cute, I just take it at face value I think with bands like these you have to. So it was very cute. Better than the ""spice things"" that's for sure! I just hope as they grow up there music does too. There kids & that's what kids sound like. They are good to run to, but other than that just cute music."
2,"Not Bad, not good","It was good. Not excellent. Not brilliant. Not horrible.. just good. The first star is for trying, and the second star is for having a few good tracks.. but even my 2 year old sister hates it.. except the bomb- c'est la vie!"
2,"Alright, Not bad at all.","I liked the CD, but I don't like B Witched one bit- they sound like 12 year old's.. Good Job to the CD, loosen up a little B Witched- Thanx!!"
1,A bad copy,"It's only another bad copy of the Spice Girls. Like All Saints, and other female groups, this is only garbage... Yes, they will need to bewitch me to buy this cd..."
1,Crappy versions of the spice girls,"B*witched is a spitting image of the Spice Girls.They will go in and will go right out just like the spice Girls too. C'est La Vie is an ok song, but their abnoctious voices sound like they have been inhaling helium for a bit too long. WARNING:After you hear C'est La Vie too many times you may get sick and start talking in a high squeeky voice. So I am warning you: Be careful."
1,gimme a break!,"this Cd is so horrible. i heard it thru their website and it deserves no stars. the lyrics are retarded and don't mix with the beat of the song. stay in the UK. girls, you don't belong in America."
5,B*witched is the best!,I simply love the song 'Rollercoaster'! B*witched is the best girl group[after the Spice Girls of course!]Highly Recommended for all preteens and all teens!
3,This CD is horrible unless.....,"You happen to be one of the many people who were turned off by the degeneration of music lately ESP in the area's of Rap (anyone ever notice how they are starting to sound the same lately) and dont have the soul to go completly country. I really think that this cd was meant for the younger crowd and it shows but you know, I am 20 year old male and I think they still have some nice songs. Ok Ok so addmittedly not as much energy as 'Five - Everyone get up' or as much uniqueness as 'Lit - ZipLock' but alot cleaner than the Bloodhound_Gang or MasterP or KidRock or most Rap/Rock Bands. Maybe someday They will be a 5 star band."
3,Take it at Face Value,"(I would have liked to give it 2 and 1/2 stars, but I gave them the benefit of the doubt and rounded up.) This album seems to be riding the ebbing tidal wave of the celtic phenomena that captured the US in the mid to late 90's due to ""Riverdance"" and artists like Loreena McKennitt and Laura Love. They've managed to work their Celtic pride into pop music, which is kind of innovative. And their pinched bubble gum voices are perfect for pre-teens and teens alike - which is the audience they're geared to. So taken at face value they've done their job. But for anyone old enough to get into a R-rated movie alone, listening to this CD is the aural equivalent of listening to your little cousin's Barney tapes. It's cute enough in the right context and audience, but it's never something any self-respecting adult would admit to owning."
5,ONE OF THE BEST CDs!,"i'm a fan of british and irish bands/singers. i really like this album. i went in a music store once and saw the ""Bwitched"" album and was really happy. i really like them because they always have the irish music in it. you can hear it mostly in ""Let's Go(the b*witched jig) and ""to i belong""."
3,kinda cool,my favorite song by b*witched is c'est la vie. i like the beat a lot. it's one of those attention catchers.
1,Can you say SPICE Wannabes?? Keavy needs voice lessons!!,"Just because pop is the thing right now doesn't give record labels the right to sign just anybody! Just because Keavy and Edele are sisters to Boyzone's Shane doesn't mean they have talent! Talent isn't always hereditary! I was excited (at first) about this cd! C'est La Vie was a great song, but OH MY GOSH! the rest is really bad! Keavy really isn't a great singer! And we aren't even given a chance to really hear the other girls! Sinead seems to have the most talent. Girl if I were you I apply for the open position in the Spice Girls! B*Witched is nothing but a ""Riding The Success of the Spice Girls"" pop group. Please, ladies!!!!!!"
1,So godawful is tragic,"B*witched are so unbelievably horrible, so apallingly unmusical, so dogmatically insensitve to the magic of of the art that they qualify as crowned heads of anti-music!"
4,oooohhhh,"i wuz just surfin the web and i came across a B*Witched site.It made me sad because it was my best friends favorite, we both danced to it. We put on a show for Our mom's and dad's.it made me sad. cuz she moved. well it has great cd. buy it."
2,This CD is okay,"My sister got this CD for Easter and some of the songs are catchy, but others are just annoying. They are a good group, and good singers. If you like a lot of pop music, then get the CD."
1,cali (yea baby!),"who would wanna b called ""b*witched""? imean,come on!and y is evrey1 saying that they sound like s.g?(spice girls)they sound wwwwaaaayyyy 2 corny 2 sound like theyre the s.g.'s!!!!!"
1,yea....right,"why r all u people saying that they sound like the s.g's?they totaly sound diffrent than s.g!!! and besides,who would wanna be called ""b*witched""?~i know i wouldnt!"
2,horrible,"Ok first thing, no one except the Corrs can pull of celtic pop. Second, this is a horrible album. Almost as bad as Aaron Carter! but not quite. There is one decent song(""To You I Belong"") and that's it! The rest is crap! I've listened to this whole thing beginning to end, and I can't say anything good about it except for that one nice song. The reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is that ""To You I Belong"" is an excellent song. Don't buy this trash album though, resort to the cd-single instead. You'll thank me for the advice."
1,act your age ladies,"Seriously, this has to be the funniest thing i have seen in ages, a load of girls in their twenties strutting around trying to appeal to eight year olds, its just obscene! I feel sorry for the familys of bewiched and i feel sorry for the little kiddies that have been sucked in by the corporate giants of this otherwise credible industry.Bwiched, GET A LIFE!"
5,Excellent CD! A wide variety of music!,"This CD is an excellent example of teenybopper-ish music that still has some sign of intelligence. The songs all have beautiful melodies and the Irish music is tied in beuatifully. The harmonies in many of the songs are breathtaking and wonderful to listen to.I got hooked by listening to Cest' La Vie on the radio and bought the CD, little was I to know that even though that song is excellent, it hardly scratches the surface of the amazing songs that I never tire of listening to! This is a great buy!"
5,B*WITCHED AND THE SPICE GIRLS RULE!,"the cd is very good! the next single is number 6 ""blame it on the waterman"""
4,This CD rox!,"I luved this CD because you can get up and dance to most of the songs. The words are also included in the CD, so u can memorize them and sing along!"
3,CHESSY.,"BWITCHED DEBUT ALBUM IS 11 YEAR OLD TYPE OF MUSIC.IT HAS SONGS ABOUT ROLLERCOASTERS,POSTMAN,AND THE WEATHERMAN.THEIR 2ND ALBUM IS BETTER.BUT I DID GIVE IT POINTS CUZ ""TO YOU I BELONG""IS A GOOD SONG."
5,Very good,"This is a really good album and I think it is great for people of all ages! If you like Irish or pop music,you will LOVE this album.If you like the Spice Girls or Backstreet Boys or even Britney Spears,you will LOVE this CD! Not only do they have outstanding voices and great dance moves,but they have great music! I am a HUGE fan!"
3,ok,"i guess it's good if you're completely lost and want to get started on weight training or something. and i agree with markb57, the exercises offered are rather mediocre... nothing ultimate about it."
1,Utterly disgusting! This is not the Shadow...,"This book does have a decent story, even if the execution was pretty bad, but this story should have been told using a different character, not the Shadow. The Shadow should never be modernized because he fits so perfectly in that distinct and specific 1930's to 1940's period. This is more like the Sam Raimi creation, Darkman. Modernizing the Shadow and his world doesn't make sense because if he was to exist in 1985 (when this story was published) then he would be a feeble, old man. You don't modernize the pulps. You may be able to do it with Doc Savage, via a time machine, but the Shadow is considered sacred ground and just shouldn't be touched. Howard Chaykin admits that he wasn't much of a Shadow fan or pulp reader. Apparently that is true!I recommend the Shadow Strikes, In the Coils of Leviathan, Hell's Heat Wave and the Denny O'neil/Mike Kaluta run. DO NOT BUY THIS!"
5,Excellent story!,"What makes a great book is great characters and that's what I found in Harper Lee's, To Kill a Mockingbird--great characters! I loved Scout, Jem, Dill, and most of all, the gentle Atticus. It's a classic novel that I am so glad that I took the time to read."
4,has true meaning,"This is a book that everyone can relate to... it takes place around maybe the mid-1900s... the book has lines to ponder to find the real underlying meaning. some parts can be slow, but overall it is a book for people who will appreaciate excellent literature."
3,very slow going...but adds a special flavor into the book...,"it mainly talks about an Alabama family's life, conflicts with others in the old times...majority of the book are descriptions, a little action every once a while...I didn't seem to enjoy it very much...it's a school assignment..."
3,"I liked it, but at the same time it made me sick","I enjoyed parts of To Kill a Mockingbird. I loved the story line of getting Boo Radley out of the house. I thought it was cute and seemed like something curiose kids would do at that age. I liked learning about Scout, Jem, Dill, Atticus, Calpurnia and all the other characters.The part though that really turned me off from the book was all the prejudice and racism. I know that that was simply the life of Maycomb, but I feel that the dialogue at some point came to an extreme.Other than this I did enjoy this book, but I would only reccomend it to mature adults."
4,It gets intresting...,"We are reading this book in my freshman class. At first it was very confusing. It didn't seem to fit very well and to be honest it wasn't very entertaining. But the farther I read the more intresting it got. When you get to the end it all makes sence. anyways I would definately recommened this book. It is very humorous and it gets exciting, trust me."
5,DONT EVEN NEED TO SAY,OBVIOUSLY NO ARGUEMENT ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS EVER WRITTEN. I DONT EVEN NEED TO SAY ANYTHING. MY RATING SAYS IT. IM A COLLEGE PROFESSOR AND EVERYBODY HAS TO READ IT.
5,A Dose of Humanity,I too was first introduced to Scout by an English teacher and in a way was introduced to myself. I am so greatful for reading To Kill A Mockingbird at such a young age. It was not until I read it again as an adult that I realized how it helped to shape my life. Trying to explain what the book is about is like trying to explain how it feels to be happy or sad or angry. A summary tells you the story. You need to read To Kill A Mockingbird to get the feeling. It helps replace the innocence we lose as we get older. I read it every so often to keep me in check.
4,hi,one time a librarian told me to read this book so I like borrowe it and like took it home and like read it but I didn't have time to read it so OK
1,Unreliable,"I went to purchase this book for one of my college classes and was pleasantly surprised when I found it for such a low price. I ordered it on the 25th of January and I have still not received it even though it says my order was placed. I was very disappointed and it caused a lot of problems during the first few classes. I would not recommend buying from this ""provider."""
2,I did not like the book,The book was not good the only reason I read it was because in my ninth grade english class we had to read twenty-five pages a night many people like it but I dont see why.
4,Can't help loving it -- but,"I bought this book because I had downloaded ""Hey, Boo..."" which discusses the story in detail. Except I realized that, even though I am intimately familiar with the movie, characters and plot details are discussed with which I am unfamiliar. Then it occurred to me -- I had never read the book. I wanted to download it to my ipod or Kindle -- no such luck. Which is my only complaint. So, when my desire to read the book overcame my need for a high tech version, I bought the book. At least the publisher is accomodating enough to produce a large print version. BTW, enjoyed every word."
1,One of the worst classics of all time,"I reckon this be anoth'r classic that doesn't deserve that status. For the first 28 (out of 30 chapters) nothing happens. Finally, in the last two chapters, you get the world's most predictable ending that you spot from a mile away! It's a crime this book is called a classic. Symbolism my (....) Harper Lee HOPES you find symbolism in this shallow book. I strongly urge you not to even read this book for free at the library; your still getting ripped off."
1,Less than one star rating,"I can't believe someone would actually resale this book . I realize it is used but it was highlighted, written on everywhere making it impossible to read the actual text. There were post it notes throughout the book and when I removed them the page was even worse."
5,Far more than a courtroom drama,"To Kill a Mockingbird has always conjured up the image of Gregory Peck in the courtroom. Not that I have anything against courtroom dramas, but I always wondered what the fuss was about. Now I can only say that I really wish I had read this book as a teenager, even though it was still a wonderful read for this 40-something year old.It is an eloquent testimony to growing up in the South during the depression. However, unlike so many ""Southern"" novels, this isn't a depressing book. Tough, difficult things happen but the reader comes away inspired. It reminded me a little bit of Angela's Ashes. Perhaps this feeling derives from the narrator being a child but it works.I won't bore you with the plot. Simply said, this is a classic for good reason. It has lots to say and it says with style and grace. It also has enough plot to be chosen by the International Mystery Booksellers Association as one of the 100 best mysteries of the 20th century."
5,Best Book I Have EVER read!,"I just finished the book today. I have read some of the reviews others have left for it and will not try to echo their excellent reviews of this wonderful book. One main thread of a lot of the reviews I have read is the regret of not having read the book when one was younger. I thought I agreed with it until I realized, I would not have appreciated or been as moved by this wonderful book when I was a young person. I am glad I waited to read this classic in middle age. All I can say it moved me deeply, made me consider my own views I have held about others and made me desperate to be even a small portion as good a person as Atticus Finch."
3,A Good Moral,"I enjoyed reading this classic story and found strong moral undertones present. I enjoyed the ideas presented by the characters as well. However, I also thought Lee droned on about seemingly trivial matters in certain cases. It was almost like reading an aside at times. After getting accustomed to her style, I trained myself to skim these sections that were not central to the plot."
4,Good bargain,Small mixup in shipment; but when it was brought to the seller's attention. Readily and quickly took care of it. Book as advertised.
4,To kill a mockingbird,"After years and years of hearing about this book, I finally read it and was NOT disappointed. It is a classic for good reason. Great story for the young and old."
1,NOT AVAILABLE ON KINDLE,How is this not available on Kindle! I have to buy this for my son to read for school. If it wasn't for that I say forget Harper Lee!
5,Great!,"This particular edition was difficult to find, but arrived on time and just as advertized. I could not be more pleased."
3,A heart felt story for older audiences by: Tyron Biggums,"I think that to kill a mockingbird is a great book for an older group of readers. I have this thought because the events in this book are based on racial issues that happened in earlier years, and as younger readers we have no recolection of what is happening. As for the older readers these kind of issues are are not hard to recall beacause in the time period they were growing up in racisim was not uncomon so while reading this they have empathy for what the writer is saying and know where she is coming from. So when i was reading this book some areas were hard to undderstand having never experienced the racial remarks and racisit actions that the characters go through and participate in. So i think that if i was older and had any reference to what is happening i think that i would enjoy this book but as a kid i do not recomend it to the younger audiences."
5,"Fear, Hate, Racism","By reading Harper Lee's over 30.000.000 sold novel, which also won the Pulizer Prize, the reader can explore the prejudices against the unknown and the racism of a province in the 1930`s trough the eyes of the young girl Scout, a laywyer's daughter. Scout and her brother Jem are frightened of Boo Radley, who isn't known by the people in Maycomb, although there are a lot of rumors about him. The lawyer Atticus Finch defends the afro-american man Tom Robinson, who is accused of raping the poor white girl Mayella Ewells.This book fascinates me, because it shows the racism and hate of this world from another perspective than the most other novels do. It shows that it is wrong to judge people only because they are different from you."
4,To Kill A Mockingbird,Product was in the condition stated and I received it before the delivery time stated. Thanks so much for your prompt service around the heavy mail time at Christmas. I would definitely purchase from this seller again.
5,Great Read,I love this book and I'm staying up late to finish it. It's summer reading and it's not even summer yet!
4,I'm a sci-fi and fantasy lover and i liked it,"Just to let you know- I usually read fantasy and sci-fi books and this is nothing of the sort.I was assigned to read this for school and I must say, I found it very interesting because I learned a lot about racism and life in the US during the great deppression. Historical/non-fiction book lovers should absolutely read this. Others might want to try it out too since its an important piece of american literacy."
4,WOW,"To Kill a Mocking BirdBeing recognized as one of the greatest pieces of American literature in the twentieth century, stating To Kill a Mocking Bird is fantastic, should go without saying. I recommend whoever is considering reading this doesn't try to figure everything they can about the book before they do so. It's better to into on a clean slate. Some references and lifestyles may be shocking but one must remember where, and when it takes place. Reading novels from today's biggest names in literature, its clear many are influenced by Harper Lee. Lacking clear violence, true love, and other huge themes seen in books and movie now a days, some may say its boring but reading thoroughly, one can see the painful conflict and romance in its pages. In summary, this piece may in some ways be offensive, but it reflects history, unjust prosecution, and the truth of the world."
5,A Lifetime Worth of Reading,"I first read this book when I was twelve yrs. old. I found myself enthralled with this accounting of small-town southern living and because the story was told thru the mind of a child I was intrigued with the lovely vocabulary and the startling clarity of a child's insight. Down thru the years I would return over and over again charting my growth thru my uncoverings of the truths written here. As a 14 yr. old I was enlightened to what rascism was, as a 17 yr old cynic I was justified in my world weariness,at 25 I was renewed and endowed with optimism for the basic goodness of mankind, and now.... I am back to open this world to my children, hoping they'll discover the warmth and beauty and create yet another link between my heart and theirs."
5,This book is marvelous!,"To Kill a Mockingbird is a wonderful novel about two siblings named Scout and Jem Finch. Scout is the narrator of this heartwarming tale of betrayal, profanity, rape, racism, and murder. It has suspense, it has comedy, and most importantly, it's one of the most fabulous books I've ever laid my eyes on."
3,TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD BY Corinne Keegan,"TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD,By Harper Lee.This story is set in the 1930's during the time of the Great depression.This story is told through an eight year olds eyes. Scout Finch,A eight year old tomboy tells the story from her point of view.Scout and her brother Jem Finch go on an adventure to discover their neighbour Boo Radly. This book is well written and describes the scenes very well the writer shows racism and justice through a childs eyes.I Think this story is a classic and is a great read.I enjoy reading this book.This book has a childs humour and adults justice."
5,Mrs. Barnes LOVES this Book! YAY Mrs. Barnes!,"To Kill a Mockingbird is a historical fiction book written by Harper Lee in 1960. It takes place is 1930 Alabama. Harper Lee wrote this book from her memories of growing up in a small racest county.The book takes place through seven year old, tom-boy Scout's eyes. Scout lives with her twelve year old brother, Jem, her father, Atticus, and their house maid, Calpurnia. Through out the book, Scout tells her memories of a mysterious house in her neighborhood, a never before seen person, and racial injustice in Maycomb County.This book is an interesting memoriable, eye-opening book, great for middle and highschool students."
3,Read this Classic book! It's great!,"The author of this book is Harper Lee. The book is also fictional. I think the theme of this book is how African- Americans were treated in the 1930's. Especially in the souther most states. THe story takes palce in Maycomb County, Alabama in 1935. All of the African-Americans in that town were treated badly and often persecuted. i thought this bokks was very interesting and personally a book that i will remember for years to come."
4,Good Review,"In the beginning the children had a big curiosity in the man who lived across the street. The man is Athur (boo) Radley. He had not been seen in many years the children wanted Boo to come out. He was nicknameed boo because, He lived in the shadows of his home. In the second half of the book the children's farther, Atticus Finch took on a case defending an african amrican named tom Robinson. this story takes place in the 1930's where there was a lot of racism. so the town was unhappy with atticus Finch. tom was accused of a supposed rape against a white girl. In the end an astonishing verdict was made."
5,This is the best book in the world!,"I have read this book at least 10 times (and I don't even like to read), and I absolutely love it!!! It is a moving, deep story of prejudice, family, and friends in the south, and its so different and great cause it is told by one person, but she expresses many views. You have not read a good book until you've read To Kill A Mockingbird."
4,"Great read, poor quality print",Loved the book as a teen and wanted a nice copy to keep for my teens.Shame about the quality for a 50th Anniversary Edition.Kids still enjoyed it.
5,To Kill a Mockingbird: 50th Anniversary,What can I say? This book is one of the all time great classics of the modern era. It parallels the movie with a bit more information as the account of one child girl's sense of justice before the civil rights of blacks became to be here in the USA. I enjoyed this very well written novel immensely.
5,A classic for the ages,"How can anyone top the remarkable ""To Kill A Mockingbird""? seen through the tender eyes of young Scout Finch, Lee unfolds the story in a beatiful way. The story was one of the most emotional and heartfelt stories ever. Anyone who thinks this book is too slow had book attention deficit disorder. It was PHEONOMAL. YOU MUST READ IT!"
3,Harper Lee - To kill a mockingbird,"Maycomb, a little town in Alabama in the 1950`s:A young girl named Scout grows up and tells the story. Her father Atticus is a lawyer and he defends a black man who is blamed for raping a white girl although he is innocent, but the whole town is full of racism and against the black man and his lawyer.The story is told in a realistic and detailed way so that the beginning of the story is difficult to understand and not very interesting. But later you get a part of the book and it is easier to understand. The novel gets very interesting and is a fascinating new part of the anti-racism literature."
5,A great book about life in the time of the depression,This is a great book about the years of the depression in the eyes of two kids Scout and Jem finch. The two children have a good time being two trouble causing kids. They have a ball tring to talk to Mr. Radly (the neighborhood freakish person.)The only problem is they the book goes from thing to thing to much.
4,Caught me because of the revelation of human kind...,"To Kill a Mockingbird was one of the few school books that I really enjoyed. It was a little hard to understand when I first started it, mainly because of the southern accent, and the widespread characters, but the book transmitted such a clear and precise meaning and definition of human society and our depiction of certain individuals, that it hooked me by the second chapter. This book was different than the others that I have read in the past because of it's clear preception of ourselves."
5,The Best Book I've ever read - Read it.,"I first read this brilliant tale of prejudice and understanding for my O levels at school. Since then I read it regularly every few months. The story has everything - humour, sadness, you name it. Recommended."
5,A really great book,"Every so often there comes the writer whose story telling is so vivid that it forms an indelible impression on the readers' mind. Harper Lee is just that kind of writer. I read this book many times and it gets better with each reading. IMHO, the real beauty of this book is that the author was able to talk about prejudice on two fronts- irrational fear towards Boo Radley from a child's point of view and that of the criminal trial. In both the cases, the real victims are the ""accused"" themselves. If you haven't read this book till now, please do take a few days to read it."
3,Stunned.,"You know what, I was about to put that book down and stop reading it. I heard so many people telling what a good book/movie it was so I was curious to find out why.The first half of the book was really dragging and sometimes seemed irrelevant and boring, but it totally turned around starting at chapter 17 (I know, a loooong way to go, but don't give up). I was amazed at how well it ended, though.I only give it 3 stars because of the slow-moving development of the plot. However, I still think it's worth reading."
2,Andres Review on To Kill A Mockingbird,"To Kill A Mocking Bird by Harper Lee is not a bad book. I enjoyed the situations that took place and the events that happend in the book. I disagree though with the character choice, not necessarily the choices but who the narrator should have been. I dont believe that Scout would be able to remeber things like the problems that took place let alone being able to basically turn away a mob? At her age things like that are hard to beleive espceially her and jem and Dill sneaking around at night? Its hard to beleive children not even ten years of age could accomplish sneaking out like that and not getting caught is very hard to beleive im 16 and cant even sneak out like those characters. I'd like to see this book from an older adults view like Atticus or a black persons view like Calpurnia. Overall the book is quite enjoyable and I do recommend it to other peolpe my age and older, this is one book i may read more then once"
2,Sorry to crash the party....,"But I think someone needs to hear both opinions. I read this book because I heard it was so good, a classic, etc. In fact, I was less than impressed. It was slow, and at certain parts I found myself wanting to skip ahead or even stop reading it. If you have any idea that this book is about racism and the unfairness of our courts, you will be dissapointed when you wait through half the book just to get to the five or six chapters dealing with the actual case. Most of this book is the story or Scout and her family, and doesn't make for what I call a gripping novel."
3,Likeable Book,"This is an interesting adventure book which highlights racial predjudice in 1930's America.It cites the adventures of Jem and Jean-Louise (Scout) Finch and their relationship with their Lawyer father Atticus.It's a book of characters, each with their own unique personalities. You get a sense of intrigue and suspense when you read about the infamous Boo Radley.On the whole this is a pleasant book which has stood the test of time."
2,It wasn't as I expected,"I'll just sart off that I had to read this book for my Sophmore year, and to me, it just didn't fit. I can't say that I hated the book, for I didn't mind some equally impressive parts, such as the court scene, and bits and parts of the ending. But I'll just say overall it just bored me. People who like it don't get angry at me, just stating my opinion of the book. I'm not putting the book harshly down, nor burning it. Actually I've read a few parts over, but that doesn't mean I truely like the whole thing. But Harper Lee's pros were he excelent use of language, and discriptive words. I'll give her credibility for that, but to me, the book didn't cut my top 100 list."
2,overrated............................,"To Kill a Mockingbird is the first and only book by the author Harper Lee. it is a work of fiction ut seems to be very realistic. it takes place in the early 1930s when there was lots of racism in the south. it teals the story of the trial of a black man acussed of raping a white girl. personnally i HATED this book! other people have regarded this book as a masterpeice of american literature but i find it horribly overrated and dumb. i dont really see why everyong loves it so much. it just tells a story of 3 dumb kids trying to get a freaky little guy named boo radley to leave his house for once. i donnt find it that great. if you like readig overated books, go for it. sorry but noo thanks. to kill a mockingbird is a book i can do without."
5,"In a nutshell, my favorite all time novel.","I am 40 years old and the first time I read this book was in high school. The last time I read the book was 6 months ago. I think the total number of times I have read Harper Lee's classic has now reached 15! People who adore reading think I am crazy for re-reading a novel so many times. I, too, enjoy reading and when I want to revisit a classic story with classic characters I always go back to Harper Lee's novel. While writing this I am already envisioning my 16th trip through the book!"
4,The revelation of Social injustice and its consequences in America,"To kill a mocking bird is a revealation of the injustice that is still perceived in America. It is a book that will bore you from the beginning but will push you to the edge of your seat from chapter 14 to the very end. Its a book for both the old and the young. Its a text book that reveals social injustices and the negative consequences it puts on society as a whole. I wish there was only one storyline, where Harper could have focus on Scout and Atticus relationship than the other characters. The book could have been breif and more riverting, provocative and captivating. But overall, I recommend this book!"
3,To Kill A Mockingbird,"The title of this book is To Kill A Mockingbird by Harper Lee. It is realistic fiction. This book has many lessons and morals. I think the theme of the book is, don't judge people because of how they look or appear to you. The whole book focusses on racism. This book is about a mysterious man who never comes out of his house, and an ongoing trial in which there's a white man's word against a black man's. The setting takes place in the 1930s, which has a big effect on the plot of the story. It's a very interesting book, there are many inspiring quotes. the morals learned in the book can be compared and relate to today's life. I agree witgh the message that the author is trying to get across. Not only do you learn moral values from this book, but you also can learn more about how life was back in the 1930s time period. Thus book is very effective, thought provoking, and sends a powerful message to all of its readers."
3,this book is not as good as they say,To Kill a Mockingbird was not as good as i thought as i tought it was going to be. Well the problem in this story well theres alot of story. Harper Lee is probably a really good artist i thought that it was realy good but it wasent that good because i didnt like it beacuse it is not my type of book i am not in to these types of books. well one problem in the book is raceikmfdv. hkflkdlhkfmdklh jndfhmhklfdmliefjhlk
5,A phenominal book,"I never was required to read this book in school and only picked it up 20 years later at the continued insistance of a friend. I hesitated to read it, not thinking I would like it, and to my surprise I loved the book. Not only is it a great read but Harper Lee is a masterful storyteller whose prose and craft are exceptional. I think I may need to reread it in the future."
4,A must read,"I never saw the movie with Gregory Peck and knew very little about the plot but I knew the book and movie have been regarded as classics. So I was expecting a great read and I wasn't disappointed. The old south's racial code of ethics, were written with a great deal of insight and I thought it was very interesting comparing it with our current day struggles with race relations. Needless to say we've come a long way, thanks to people's attitudes like the character Atticus portrayed in this book. A must read."
4,A classic which ought to be read,"I was an English major and had never read some of the classics, such as this book is. So, I read it. I hate novels but found this text to be a delightful read. It is slow to get going but once you arrive at the courtroom scenes, it is all worth it. The characters are fun to get to know and the central message of the book is great. It is an easy book to read; thus, its prominence in high schools, and its a quick read too.Sometimes you read a novel and hope that there are some undertones present from which you can make some strong conclusions about what the author is trying to say. Some books fail at this entirely; this one doesn't. It is filled with subtle meaning and revelation. If you want to read a text that is simple to read and full of meaning, a true American classic, this is the one for you!"
5,A Must Read For All Ages,To Kill a Mockingbird was one of the most profound novels I have ever read in my life. It is wonderfully constructed and the two plots merge together wonderfully. I highly recommend this book for anyone over eighth grade. A book that can be read over and over again.
5,Not a bad read...,"This epic novel is one of the best that I've read.This story has to do with the contraversial issues of racism.Taking place in the days where african-americans really didn't get respect,it is precise in every detail,and gives the reader a front row seat at the events that happen.Harper Lee is a critically acclaimed novelist,and this book gave her a place in the world of literature forever.-Great Book! Recommended!!!!!!!!"
3,don't settle for a mediocrity,"I think the author had some good qualities.One was that she is very detailed,but she leaves you to figure out things for yourself.But for the average reader or a young reader this woulud be very boring them.This is a little bit of my opinion about this book.This book strikes me as a mediocre book.since it can be dull sometimes it's hard to keep focus while reading this book. So no I wouldn't recommend this book to ANYONE at all unless they're very matture.so this is my reasoning and basis for my rating"
4,A book that comes to life,"I was shocked to see such a classic on Amazons best sellers list. I read this book 18 years ago in High School as an assignment. I can still remember the name of the main character Scout and I can vividly remember the writing brought her to life. It seems as if I was there, I remember the hot court room where her father defended a black man accused of rape of a ""White trash"" woman. I can remeber scout being attacked in the woods while wearing a halloween costume.I remember the sounds, and darkness almost as if it was a memory. For a book to leave such a mark on a 16 year old 18 years ago is a feat. If you love literature and vivid living writing you will love this book."
3,A timeless classic,of course this is a timeless classic of a home town life during the depression. this book is told from the first person persective of scout the youngest child. her father atticus is a lawyer defending a black man in a rape trial wich makes life for her and her brother jem even worse. read this book and realize how they overcame the turbulances of life in this small town.
4,To Kill A mocking Bird Review,"The Book, To Kill A Mocking Bird is pretty good once you get to the racial disscussions, but the author give too much information about the charactors and not enough on the acutal event."
3,Not as good as the movie,"To Kill a Mockingbird is a pretty good book, but not nearly as good as the movie. The first half of the book jumped around too much and was simply a waste of about 130 pages. However, I truly enjoyed the second half. Atticus Finch is really an interesting character, and Bob Ewell is truly dispicable. TKAM is certainly worth reading, but don't expect too much. It is definitely not what what I would call Pulitzer Prize-caliber."
4,Excellent Book,"To Killl A Mockingbird is a slow start book. Harper Lee put herself in the book as Scout. She has a brother, Jem, her father is Atticus, and a family cook, Calpericus. The time period is of when people were very racist. Their father is a lawyer and ends up defending an ""innocent"" black man. The family is singled ou, plus they have a black cook. Time passes, and Atticus gets older, so Jem does more things with Scout. Yes, I would have someone read this book. It goes through a very interesting court trial. The trial displays the feelings white people had for black people. Once you get past the begining, the book keeps your attention, and makes you want to keep reading. There are many exciting ""run-ins"" with characters that are a joy to read."
4,Eddie's TKAM Review,"To Kill a Mockingbird by Haper Lee. This book was published by Waner Books in 1960. This fiction novel takes palce in the times of racism in the south around the 1930's. It takes place in Maycomb, Alabama. This setting completely sets the tone for the entire storyline. The prejiduce thoughts guides the aactions and words of every white citizen in town except one brave and thoughtful individual named Aticus Finch. He represented a man convited of assult and rape named Tom Robinson.I feel that this was an intersenting and memorable book that prevoked some questions in virtues and morals. In conclusion, I would recommend this book to anyone that would enjoy a dramaticand inquizitive book."
4,to kill a mockingbird,"When i read, I like a book that keeps me wondering, exploring, and guessing. And to me those are the strenghts of this book. The author starts out giving you an review of the family, friends and businesses. Then the author goes to one of the main focuses of the story; the Radley's. Whenever she( Haper Lee, the author) began to talk about the Radley family or about the Boo Radley, who is an important but quiet character, my interest level would go from dull to the level oh... oh... tell me more.If i had to rate this book from 1-10, would give it an 7. I would rate it a 7 because thi book kept me interested but but not enough to keep every reader hooked."
3,Somewhat Sad,"I read this about three years ago when I was in 7th grade, and although it was well written, and very interesting I thought it was very sad. Most people have to read this in 9th grade, and I wouldn't disobey a teacher, but I wouldn't read it if you didn't have to, not because it's a bad book, but because it's depressing. But that's just my opinion."
4,It's a very inspring book!,"I read To Kill A MockingBird as an english text. The book was slow for the first couple of chapters, but then pulled me in. Harper's use of language and the imagination of Scout really set it off. Thanks for writing a true to life novel!"
5,Very Heartfelt,An excellent book about racism and how a white family helps to combat it. Very heartfelt. A triumph. This book is filled with hopes that we can end bigotry. Harper Lee told a great story that will live on. Highly Recommended
4,To Kill a Mockingbird,"I have to admit, this book started off slow. But then towards page fifty I began to understand why this book is so popular. Scout is so young and she doesn't understand much, but she's like most 8-year olds and she thinks fairly and begins to realize that most people are unfair and unjust, and that's just how it is.I liked how her relationship with Jem and Atticus don't really change throughout the book. When most people think of a love story they think of two people falling in love but this is a love story between a young girl and her family."
5,to kill a mocking bird,"I think that this book is a rilly grate book. It rilly makes you think about how in the real life it afects the humans behavior to innocence. many people will look into this book and say,""this book sounds like some boaring book. I rilly think this book is a grate book and I learn alot from it, as others did too."
4,"It was confussing, but good","I liked the book. It was interesting how the book was based on a flashback, insted of a present time."
3,"They made me read it, it was OK but really it was pointless","Basically its kind of a autobiography about her, but as I say its boring and pointless!!"
5,havent read this in a while but because of Mr. Danza teach DVD I thought Id reread this.,"Havent read this since High School. I was viewing the Teach with Tony Danza and was inspired and motivated by what he did in Phillie, PA back in 2009-2010. Im sorry that after all the hard work to get this program out that it didnt do better in ratings. Additionally, sadden that Tony Danza and his wife have agreed at this writing to go for a divorce after almost 25 years of marriage. Im praying that they will stop it though. There is always hope. Anyway, this was one of the books he was using in the 10th Grade English class on literature."
3,Is it really that good?,"Unlike most people, I was not ""delighted"" or ""enchanted"" by this book.It was required reading for me, as it is for most American children, and though I feel like a traitor saying this, I didn't think it was that great, and I still don't. The plot is very simple, the character development is mediocre, and the writing is okay. In short, I simply do not see why this book has become as popular as it has.Was it interesting? Sure, it was okay, but in my humble opinion it simply does not stand up to classics like Uncle Tom's Cabin, Tom Sawyer, The Lord of the Rings, etc.I do think, however, that everybody should read it. It's not that it is that amazing of a book, it is that it is once of the icons of American literature."
3,Arrived on Time,I purchased this book after going to three different stores that said they had the book. I bought it for my son who needed it for a school project. The book arrived a day before his deadline to have it. The local library did not have it. Thanks so much to the former owner and Amazon.
4,This book was great!,"I loved this touching story, as told by 8-year old Scout Finch, about growing up in the small town of Maycomb, Alabama amidst racial turmoil and the depression. It was just a great story.Now that I am finished with the book I already miss Scout, Jem, Dill, Atticus, and of course Boo.If you are looking for a book with a great story written by an author who knows how to write and use the english language, above the Grisham level, then this is a book for you."
5,The Flagship of American Novels,"We happily add our voices to the chorus praising this novel. Harper Lee's inspired story is a beacon for souls searching for humanity, social justice, and human connection. We laughed, and we cried. We were stirred by the words of Atticus Finch. This spring, we will share our passion for this book through a workshop for readers new to Ms. Lee's novel. Wish us luck, although with this book, we won't need it."
5,Extraordinary story of courage through a child's eyes.,"On the surface, first-person story of a young girl'sadventures in a small southern town during the depression.Story addresses impact of economic hardship and extremeracial injustice through the eyes of the heroine withoutpatronizing her.I believe the character of ""Dill"" was based on TrumanCapote, a childhood friend of Harper Lee.One of the finest books I have ever read; I generallyreread it every year or two."
5,More than a classic,I didn't want this book to end but knew that it was complete on the last page. That doesn't happen often. It transported me back to childhood and reminded me to take people where they are at. Beautiful.
5,The best book ever written!!!,"This book is the best I have ever read. it takes me to the south and links me to the past and how Harper Lee grew up. It shows the spectrum of how people in the south from the bigoted country men to the dignified man who would defend any man no matter his race. The book also shows how children's perceptions are changed through time. To see her llife through a man's she was afraid of to begin with and grew to know and like him. The best book ever written, now or in the future."
5,The book was great!,"This book is very interesting and absorbing. You feel like you never want to put it down! There are strong, clear characters, and neat conflicts. I really recommend it!"
3,This isn't really my type of book.,This book was not all that good. I really don't like it all that much. To me it was boaring. But to you it might have been good.
5,I recommend this book to anyone from 12 years and up!,"To Kill a Mockingbird in my opinion is a brilliant novel I loved every minute of reading it, I couldn't put it down!This book gave a good insight to what life was like in America in the 1930's and the kind of prejudices people had to live with in everyday life and how they coped with it.It was also seeing what the characters lives were like through the eyes of the little girl Jean Louise(Scout).This is a good book to keep and give to your children."
1,another boring school reading assignment,"i had to read this book in 9th grade. i heard that it was supposed to be this wonderful american classic, and i actually looked forward to reading it. well, all i'm gonna say is that it sucked. it was just like any other book, nothing special. yes, the prejudice part was good, i think it could show people that we need to accept our differences, but it just wasn't that deep. i got bored after 20 pages. all in all, i was very disappointed and to whoever gets an assignment to read this, good luck."
1,To Kill A Mockingbird,This was an exciting book. It has so many twists. This book teaches you alot of life lessons.
1,This Could Have Put Lee In Jail,"In 1960 Harper Lee published To Kill A Mockingbird. About thrity years earlier William Faulkner had published the short story Dry September. ITS THE SAME STORY. To Kill A Mockingbird is not a bad book, its just simply not original (I won't say plagairized because I'm not sure that it is). Read Faulkner, particularly the short stories Dry Semptember, Barn Burning, and That Evening Sun Go Down and the novels Santuary, Light In August, and The Sound and The Fury. You get a much better look at the same time, place, and issues that Lee looks at, but you get it from the original source who happens to have been a much better writer."
2,I cannot condone it,"nope sorry uh uh cannot do it I cannot do it. Making fun of people because of race and killing birds is not good. I do not believe in that and I cannot believe they wrote a book about it. Rather superfluous and expenentially trimacidus if you ask me. Best read on an empty stomach with a touch of lemon, and maybe with some kool aid that is shaken, not stirred."
1,"Sorry about that last entry, i accidentally pressed ""enter""","To Kill A MockingbirdHarper LeeThe Book takes place in a small, quiet town called Maycomb, in Maycomb County, Alabama. Here Scout and her brother, Jem, grow up while some wierd stuff happens all around them.This book confused me, alot. I could not say I was entertained in the least bit. The plot, if there was one, was derivitive and often meandered form a single idea. First, it starts out like many books do and recollets past events, then a mystery, then a court drama, then a regular drama, then a mystery again."
1,OVERRATED AD NAUSEAM,"This is not great literature, and I avoid teaching it at all costs. It's not even good. The characters are black and white two-dimensional cardboard cutouts. The rednecks are evil, the blacks are victims, and the self-righteous Atticus is too good to be true. There is nothing here to examine or explore. Critical thinking skills need not be applied for understanding. Moreover, if the lack of complexity and verisimilitude doesn't stick in your craw, then the insipid narration of the androgynous Scout will. This novel is popular due, in part, to the fact that the reader can feel morally superior to white trailor trash as he identifies with the demigod, Atticus. Shakespeare, the consummate craftsmen of characterization, understood that even the evil (save Iago) have some redeeming qualities, and the good flaws. To Kill a Mockingbird is about as deep as a rain puddle."
1,Doesn't even deserve the one star...,"Although the author had some good points, I must say that this book sucked a big fat one star. I thought it was horribly thought out and it was considerably a snoozer. I seriously feel asleep readin this. I advise and suggest that nobody dare pick up this book. You may die of boredom."
1,Received different book.,"I'm not a happy customer. Did not receive the book pictured in the shopping caft, but a blue textbook."
1,So very boring,"The only reason this book deserves one star is that something interesting actually happened,albeit AT THE END OF THE FRIGGIN' BOOK!I swear watching Teletubbies or mold grow in your shower is more interesting than this book.I could not get through half of it.Nothing even goes on until the very end.By then though,you have given up as did I.I agree that the book has a good plot but, how the plot is written is an entirely different story.One reviewer on here said that it sounded like it was written by a fifth grader.I wholeheartedly agree.I will never pick up this book again."
1,Doesn't deserve the title American Literature classic,"This is was a pitiful book with little substance except for those people out there who are so racist that they will support things just BECAUSE it promotes other races...which is really prejudice. The book deals with those sorts of issues. If people would just leave old prejudices to heal themselves, it would all be better, and best of all, this book wouldn't exist"
1,UGH!,"I was assigned this book for a reading assignment and me and the guy who sat next to me seemed to be the only ones who hated the book out of the whole class and we sit right infront of the teachers desk so we gave her heck all day! lol anyway... I seriously dislike this book! It is very boring... you'll be reading a conversation and then all of a sudden Scout will jump in and ramble on for pages with stupid pointless information about something that doesn't even have to do with the story... usually about the very dull and boring city of maycomb. The book would only be about 150 pages without all that!! Some parts I seriously just wanted to scream it was so boring!!! There is SO MUCH random junk that when we got to our reviews and tests, I couldn't even remember half of the little things that happened in the book. To make a long story short, this book is no 'work of art' and I STRONGLY suggest picking something else!!"
5,my review,it was a wonderful book when i first read it in high school about 37 years ago! it's a wonderful book now!
3,I think the movie is better,"Enjoyed the book, but prefer the movie. Gregory Peck in glasses and a life sized vegetable what more do you want. Perhaps a frenzied dog and a hot summer."
4,TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD,i really feel this is a great book.i would rate it 4 stars. what i liked about this book is the 2 part r the trial part of the book. The 1st part wasn't the most interesting part even though i like the caracters in that part. I would recomend this book to anyone who was a little older and enjoys the kind of books i like. I will read this book again when i get older so maybe i will get something different out of it. After reading it i know why it is an award winning book. I hope u will enjoy it as nuch as i did!!!!!!
3,hey hey hey,"This book is a good book. When you start to read this book you have to be patient. The book has two parts in it. The first part is very boring, there is absolutely no action. Once you read into the saecond part of the book, it gets much more exciting.The Tom Robinson trial starts and many other things happen as well. I would recommend this book to patient readers, who like books to get better at the end. If you need action on every page, don't pick up this book, or start at the second part. I gave this book three stars because the begining was so boring. This is my review of To Kill A Mockingbird."
4,A Wonderful Classic,"This novel takes place in Maycomb Countty, Alabama. The plot of this story is great. Some of the interesting characters are, Scout, Jem, Atticus, Boo Radley, and Tom Robinson. This book gives me a good perspective on life and I learned many life lessons. One thing that ticked me off was how the white people treated the black people. Some thing I was proud of was when Atticus decided to defend a black man, Tom Robinson in his trial in the case of him rapeing a young women. Finally I give this book 4 stars. I give it 4 stars because it was great to read and I was intriqued by each character, chapter, and part in the book. But most of all the life lessons I learned, life values, and mental values toward life. It was an interesting book and great book.- Bruno St.Jacques"
3,To kill a mockingbird,To kill a mockingbird is a fair book. Out of 5 stars starts i would rate it 3 stars. THis book teaches you alot about how back then poeple could be so racist. Harper Lee is an outstanding writer she used vivid words to help to visualize the events that were occuring. IT takes place in Maycomb county. About a brother Jem and his sister Scout. It explains their journey of growth and experience with the help of their dad Atticus. There dreaded neighhbor Mrs. Dubose and many other character. I would recommend this book it teaches you alot about life.
3,To kill a mockingbird,I would recomend this book to people who are a little older than us because I think we had a little trouble reading it. Some things I liked about it was how she showed the lessons of life throughout the book. The plot was well written and exciting.Somethings I disliked about it was it was more of an adult book so it was hard to follow what was happening. I think they should make a younger version for people who don't really like to read. This is my review for To Kill a Mockingbird.
3,To Kill a Mockingbird,The book was realistic on what life was like when there was discrimination against the blacks. The way the people treated Tom Robinson will make you angry of why people could do something like that. However some down parts to the book is that the first part is pretty boring. It explains what life was like for Scout before the trial. The only part I was really interested in was the trial.
4,To Kill A Mockingbird,"In the novel ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" Harper Lee describes how the two young children Jem and Scout Finch are growing up in the Deep South during the thirties. Through their eyes you see how the society of a small town called Maycomb treats blacks and uses prejudices. So a black man named Tom Robinson is charged with the rape of a white girl. You get to know the injustice of this time.The novel is quite funny and interesting - Your own fault if you don't read it."
3,''TKAM'',"Theme-good and evil, importance of moral and social class.What I think about the book is interesting because it telllot of good thing that u can learn and also u can learn what is the bad thing and good thing that u need to know.I agree when the author said that ''It is a sin to kill a mockingbird."
4,To Kill A Mockingbird Book Review,"The book To Kill A Mockingbird was a very interesting story. It was written by Harper Lee. It is a realistic fiction story. The theme of the story was to never harm an inocent person. This story took place in the 1930's, in the south. There were a lot of conflicts between the African-Americans and white peopleThis book is very interesting and you won't be able to put the book down. I enjoyed reading this. I think this book had a good theme. This was a good book, and I recamend it to everyone."
3,Robbie Robinsion related to Tom Robinsion?,To kill a mockingbird is a fiction book.The theme of the book is like back in 1930 and how people treated other people.The problem this address most is life growing up back in the old old days when there was still racism.The story line for To kill a mockingbird is about a family that goes through hard times and surive and how they get through it.This book is a book that takes you into a persons life u feel how they felt back then.I agree with the other that racism was bad and how it was bad and how it was really bad in certain towns.I disagree with how they viewed people back then because everyone wasnt like that.This book raises the about racism like how they treated a man called Tom Robinsion.This book is kinda like Huckle Berry Fin how there was racism in that book.This book made me see how bad some people treated other colors.This book is a book that can teach your many things in life.
3,To Kill a Mockingbird,"To Kill a MockingbirdBy: Harper LeeThis book is historical fictionThe theme (lesson)is to not kill a mockingbird.The book took place in Maycomb County.They say, ""It's a sin to kill a mockingbird because they don't do anything but sing.""In my opinion, I think that the book is boring. I like the movie better because it explains the events that are going on.I agree with Martin Luther King jr. - that everyone should be treated equally, and that no one would be judged by another person.I disagree that Tom Robinson should have been shot especially seventeen times; That's harsh. I agree that the Ewells are liars and they are bad people to be around.i think that they leave out some of the ideas on what Scout thinks about some of the events that are going on. Also, I think Tom Robinson could have said more during his testimoy."
4,...a sin to kill a mockingbird.,"I have been making a point to read some of the 'Top 100 Books' over the years. Some of these books have been a little disappointing. 'To Kill a Mockingbird' is one of those books that lives up to all the credit it is given.Harper Lee takes us to the South of the 1930's through the eyes of Scout. Scout is the youngest child of Atticus Finch who is a lawyer in the small town. We see the poor conditions is this small town. The poor children who go to school with Scout and her brother Jem. We see the segregation and hate towards the African Americans.We see a small town gripped in the prejudices of the age. An African American man is accused of raping a poor white girl and the linch mobs form up. Scout is able to diffuse a conflict and made smarter minds prevail through her innocent outlook.This books is wonderful and while the times described seem so long ago, unfortunately the message still rings clear and is timely."
5,One of the most enjoyable,I loved this book. Sissy Spacek was the perfect actor to do the book. She brought it to life. I was sorry when the book was over!
4,A nice story!,"Lee's only pulitzer price winning novel is a true classic! Lots of good characters and a nice plot filled with the issues that we're all struggling with today (e.g. racism, flaws in justice, torn relationships, and judgmental people)...I liked how all the characters interacted with each other and stuck by each other except at the part where it came to the trial of Tom Robinson. You have people rooting for him and people wanting him to be punished for a crime he never committed, which divides the line of love and coming together in a realistic way as told by Harper Lee....do read this novel and I assure you you will like it and consider it a well-written classic."
5,Best school-assigned book I've ever read.,"I had thought, after reading House on Mango Street, that all books in sophomore year were dull and pointless. This book, however, was excellent.I was getting sick of all those ""spunky female lead"" stories and, while this may fall under that category, it is still a very good book.Unfortunately, my teacher was disorganized and we didn't get to finish reading the book. I got the Cliff's notes and read them after school was out because my mom said that would be the best idea. Uh...that's mothers for ya.Anyhow, all I'm really trying to say is that this book is meaningful and deep and all that stuff while still managing to be funny.That is what makes a good book."
4,Homespun novel with good theme,A homegrown novel that tells the story of several children living with a single father in less than desirable conditions. The novel carries a powerful message.
2,not a very good book,this was a okay book it was boring most of the part with very low action MABY THATS BECAUSE I LOVE ACTION BOOKS!! dont read if you like the low matinence books
2,Very Weird,"The only good thing about this book is that thestoryline os OK. However it is kind of retarded. What kind of person call there dad by there first name. Also who knows if Boo and his family are ""strange"" because no one will ever talk to them."
2,Bad reading,"I would have thought more people would be rating the actual reading of this book, rather than the content. I have loved this book since I read it in high school and have read it several times since then. I have listened to it read by Roses Pritchard and now by Sissy Spacek. Sissy does a terrible job reading: no expression and several mispronunciations. I was embarrassed for her."
2,This book is very prejudice.,I really do not recommend this book to anybody because the whole book is based on prejudice and it centers around a principle that is not correct or appropriate. This is a required book for ninth graders and I think that it is ridiculous that they should be required to read this book because they are learning about Black prejudice and it is as though no one wants to acknowledge White prejudice at all. There are words that are offensive to Black people yet nothing negative is even thought about White people.
2,Not very good,"This book was tremendouly slow, and most of the time boring. I mean no offence to the people who liked this book, but I personally thought it was a borig book. Maybe it's because I like to read books with more action. I did not like this book, it had too little action, and even the climax was not very exiting."
2,Low budget edition,"This 'library edition' is quite cheezy. The book is small, light, and the paper is so thin, you see through to the print on the other side. Also, the paper is not really white, it is sort of a pale grey color. If i was to buy this again, I would pay more for a nicer edition."
2,Was expecting more from Sissy Spacek,"I was really expecting the definintive reading of this fantastic classic but was disappointed in Sissy's reading. It is stiff, slow, and a bit forced. She reads like she's reading to a 2nd grader rather than reading about one, working too hard to be completely articulate. It is worse at the beginning of chapters and loosens up some in the middle but is disappointing from such a fine actress. If the Roses Pritchard version comes out on CDs, I'd rather have it."
5,What I Remember,"I remember the first time that I had read this novel for a class of mine in high school. I thought that it was going to be boring, yet what I found was completely the opposite. The time period that Lee sets her story is what makes this novel different. It is the early part of the 20th Century, a time where prejudice could influenced the fate of an individual in the U.S. courts. The ignorance of people concerning issues of race and class are clearly acknowledged. The simplicity of its diction as well as s narration from Scout's perspective create an atmosphere of childhood nostalgia. Overall, it's a book that dares to address societal taboos."
5,I thought it was a great book,"To Kill A Mocking Bird is a great book. It showed howAfro-Americans were treated unfairly in that time. Tom was accused ofbeating and raping a girl but all the evidence was pointing away from him. The book was good because it kept you on your toes, you never knew what would be next."
5,A Timeless Classic,"Having lived in the South several times now, I can relate to nearly every character in this book. I laugh out loud every time I read the part about Atticus and Miss Maudie having ""an arm waving conversation"" and I laugh even harder when I read about Miss Stephanie, the gossip who always ""by the time she had told it twice had been there and seen it all"".The Book has a very interesting plot and it leads up to a powerful climax and then dwindles back down to normalcy, like real life."
2,To Kill a Mockingbird,"Harper Lee is the author of the book To Kill a Mockingbird. This book is a historical fiction about courage and prejudice. The book is about two kids named Jem and Scout who live in Maycomb, Alabama. Eventually a white man blames a white man for a very serious crime. I personally thought that the book was boring because they talked about stuff going on in the town and sometimes the world."
3,"It is a fairly good read, but what is all the buzz for?","Is this really considered a classic? Though issue of race and prejudice is certainly of great importance, I don't see as though its been evoked in this book in some sort of revolutionary way. Tom Robinson's story is painful to hear, and the depth to which Maycomb is developed by the author is impressive, but this book is by no means a classic. The author's style is of no great note, and the plot, while carrying the reader through the duration of the book, is not of a ""classic"", compelling nature. All in all, a solid book."
2,Couldn't Finish,"Sorry but I honestly couldn't finish this book. I had to read it for my 11th grade English class, and it was utter torture to try and get through the first half of it. So I skipped about 15 chapters of this classic. It was boring, the characters felt flat, I didn't care for the whole plot. It just felt like it lacked basic structure to me. Maybe it was the fact that I was forced to read it. Who knows, but this book had me falling asleep, or just gazing off into space. I couldn't do it, so I would normally leave it opened while I read something more enjoyable. Maybe in the far future I'll pick it up again, and try it out...but hell, I don't think I can. It was such a horror to read, and I don't think I could even spend my money's worth on it. Sorry but this book was just horrible in my opinion."
5,To Kill a Mockingbird,"The book To Kill a Mockingbird was an great book. However, there were parts of the book which nI did not agree with, and did not like. The book got off to a boring, slow start, but turned out to be an excellent book. The book is writted through this girl named Scout. She has a brother, Jem, and a best friend, Dill. The book starts out with the three of them trying to get Boo Radley out of his house. However, during the middle of the book they get involved in a trial, which leads to what happens in the end. This book has excellent suspence, and an excellent story line. I suggest this book to everyone. It is a great book! :) Note: dont let the slow start make you quit this book in the beginning. The book gets sooooo much soooooo much sooooo much better! Read this book!"
5,The Invisible Characters,"Scout's mother, Tom Robinson, and Boo Radley never or rarely speak for themselves, but they cast long shadows on one little girl's life. What made this book a gem for me was the way Harper Lee allows the reader to fill in the landscape. Atticus tousels the hair of a little girl before delivering bad news that will change her life forever; we are left to guess how it must remind him of telling his own daughter that mom will never return. He replies to his sister, ""I do the best I can with them (the kids)"", leaving his grief unstated.In a time of public disgraces and eternal processing of emotion, Harper Lee's book is a reminder of a time of privacy, decorum, and the power of what is left unsaid."
5,This is a masterpeice of american literaure.,This book portrays the innocence of a child and the predjudice that a child has to find out. I loved this book and recomend it to anyone. This book is truly a work of art
3,A little disappointed.,"I purchased this book for my daughter's 16th birthday. She read this book in school and enjoyed it immensely. I was extremely excited to get it for her, she loves literature. I felt good about getting her the book as an investment in her education and her cultural future, something she could pass on to her children. When I opened the package upon arrival I was quickly disappointed in the quality of the pages. All the ends, opposite of the binding were cut unevenly. It is impossible to fan through the pages! The pages appear to have been cut before they were bound together. I gave it to her and she was happy to have it, but I felt a little ashamed."
2,Okay,I had a hard time reading it in school and I had an even harder time reading it for my book club. It is well written.
3,It didn't ressonate with me...,"To Kill a Mockingbird is about growing up and coming of age in the Deep South. It centers around the Finch family: Atticus Finch is the father and a lawyer, Scout the spunky girl who can rough and tumble with the best of the boys, and Jem the older brother. The story focuses on the day to day wanderings of Jem and Scout and how their lives change as a result of the trial their father gets involved in. Atticus defends a black man accused of raping a white woman. It's a trial that he has no hope of winning, but he tries his hardest because that's what is right.It's a good story because it shows tolerance and acceptance. It asks the reader to step into another person's shoes to see life from their point of view before passing judgement. It was a good read and I liked Lee's writing style. That said, it's not a favorite and not one that I'd pick up again. It just didn't ressonate with me like I was hoping it would."
3,To Kill a Mockingbird - Audio by Sissy Spacek,"Roses Pritchard did the audio on cassettes ten to fifteen years ago. Frankly, I enjoy her rendition much more that the audio on CD with Sissy Spacek. I am just not hearing much expression in Spacek's voice...very bland.I was also disappointed that the first CD in the set has a defect. I don't know if there will be others in the set of eleven CD's or how much trouble it will be to try to get a replacement. Very disappointing and annoying."
5,one of the best pieces of american literature ever written,"Simply marvelous in both technique and content. Brilliantly written in first person as only a master of her craft could possibly accomplish. This was Lee's only novel, and when you've done it right, one may just be enough. Recommended reading for anyone, especially those of us from the South. This is who we were, and who we still are under the surface veneer of only sixty years of attempt to change perceptions of people. Outstanding book."
5,An extremely powerful work of literature,"To say that this classic moved me would be an magnificient understatement. At age 12, it opened my eyes and soul to a period that was previously shrouded in generalities. At age 21, it still continues to grip me with Lee's chilling displays of ignorance and blind hate. It's my personal #1 favorite and recommended reading to anyone!"
5,Very good book!,"I really liked this book,and recommend to anyone who likes ""southern"" type books, or just a good book! Read it y'all! :)"
5,Best book I ever read,"I had to read this book for English class this year, and truly it is the best book I have ever read in my life (possibly excluding ""Goodnight Moon"", etc.). If you have not read this book, read it! And, it's funny, you don't realize really what the book is about until you finish it. But it still takes my breath away."
3,A short summary-,"To Kill A Mockingbird started off as an interesting book. You really didnt know what it was going to be about, except that prejudice would play a big part in the plot. As the book progressed I started to like Scout(one of the main charcters). She had a very strong-will for her age, and matured alot by the end. Her father Atticus defended a black man-Tom Robinson during this period of racial hatred(the great depression). The book taught me about how people were in this county at that period of time, and showed the theme of initation, and standing up for what you believe."
1,Boring book,"A typical paragraph in this book reads""Jem"", said Scount""yes"" said Jem""would you like to play in the garden"" said Scout""Some other time"" said Jem""ok"" said Scout""Go away now"" said Jem...Painful to read"
1,Spare ME!,"Well if this is a classic then so could the Charlies Angel's movies. All the book consists of is a middle-class family in the south with a few weird neighbors. I mean come on. Who really cares about a little girl that goes around the neighborhood doing things like spying on her albino neighbor. If that makes a book a classic, shame on you. Atticus against all odds is always fair and never makes anyone mad. He deals with all disputes perfectly. A wee bit too good to be true. Don't you think? Finishing this book felt like the equivalent of fighting in World War II with nothing but an army of G.I. Joes. If you have been given this book as a present I give you my deepest condolences."
1,TOO OVERRATED,i had to read this for school and i hated it. i'v read other classics and i liked those. this book does not deserve to be a classic
1,To kill a Mockingbird,"In our most humble opinion we think this book could use some work. Half the book dose not appeal to the readers eye, but on the other hand the other half of the book is completely different from the first half. This is a story that may have touched the hearts of some, but for the many that don't understand it. We agree with them because it doesn't make any sence to us. Two of the only good parts are when Tom gets convicted of a crime he didn't commit and when Mr. Ewell tries to kill Jem and Scout. Granded, we do commend you for the winning the Pulitzer Prize in 1961 and also winning Academy Award winning for the film which is also a classic."
1,Read it and you'll regret it!!!!,It is a very interesting and great book!!!!! I expecially liked how they talked of people standing up for what is right!! NOT!!!!!!!!!!!!! I really didn't enjoy the book at ALL. I had to read it as an assignment for a class and I regret actually doing an assignment in that class...
5,The back of the book is right!,"You know how on the back of books it always says how great the book is? No matter how good the book really is? Well, with To Kill A Mockingbird, there's hardly room for debate over the fact that the back tells the truth. The classic is still moving and riveting after all the years. The story of how a young child stood strong true to her morals through racism, critisicm, and cruelty is, however seemingly dated some of the material may be, still a darn good read and the ultimate page-turner (and quite a tear jerker). I just couldn't put it down! A definite must read for EVERYONE!"
4,Read before you judge,"""To Kill a Mockingbird"" by Harper Lee, is a truly amazing book. Informative and descriptive, Harper vividly makes the characters from Maycomb, Alabama, come alive. Scout, Jem, Atticus, and Arthur ""Boo"" Radley are memorable. Harper's powerful and entertaining story of racism during the Great Depression has the right amount of suspense, drama, humor, and Southerness to it. At first I didn't understant the title, but now I understand why it is called ""To Kill A Mockingbird."" Tom Robinson symbolizes the mockingbird and Bob Ewell is the racist who kills a man so pure, so innocent, that Jem weeps at the verdict. Bob Ewell and Mayella's false accusation of Tom Robinson results in a chain reaction ending with Tom Robinson's death. But the jury is also responsible for his death. ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" shows coming-of-age, innocence, and above all things love."
2,Not good.,"The only reasons I gave this two stars is I like Atticus and Boo. The End. Otherwise this book was dull with mostly boring characters, the court scenes are the closest thing to entertainment in this book."
3,To Kill A Mockingbird,"I read the book To Kill A Mockingbird for an English project.I was surprised at how this book really turned out because at first i didden't like it and it was hard for me to get into. It is set in the 1930's in Alabama. It tells the story of Scout and Jem and what their childhood was like during the Great Depression. Their father is a lawyer of Maycomb, Alabama, who is defending a black man who is accused of committing a crime.It turnes out that the father is really on his side though.To Kill A Mockingbird is is a piece of history that deals with racesim and childhood innocence.I would give this book a good rating."
3,"Sensitive, imaginative, good","This is a good story, and importantly, told through the eyes of a young uncorrupted mind - which in itself is a literary effort not to be trifled with.However, I reduced a couple of stars for purposes of relativity ... I'm not from the USA .... and for non-US readers, who have been touched by other workproducts on this subject, the experience of this book may not compare as well as the movie ""A time to kill"".With the amount of attention that this subject has received in various art forms, with exceptional artistic results, this book can hold its ground but it doesn't necessarily beat the field."
2,To Kill A Mockingbird,"This book ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" has two parts to it. The first part is about these kids wanting some guy named Boo Radley to come outside. The second part is about a case that Atticuss is doing. He's deffending a black a man.I think this book wasn't good because it was boring. This book needed something more because after a while you will stop reading and not pick the book back up. This book needs action and mystery to it. It could be in the end of part one and two. The only people who would like this book is the people who like books with no action and mystery."
2,Sorry Guys Thumbs Down,I am sorry. Although this book is hailed as something amazing. I was not impressed. Had it not been for the interesting Boo Radley Character this book would be a waste of paper.
3,Derivative and insubstantial,"Those who liked this book should read Faulkner's Intruder in the Dust to see where the plot comes from. This is not an original story nor is it very deep. Atticus Finch is a good character but the story made a better vehicle for Gregory Peck than it does a serious novel.This is one of those books (like Catcher in the Rye) whose enduring popularity has always been a puzzle to me. A simple story, simply told. So what? We don't learn anything from it. And if one wants the real southern experience, stick with Faulkner or Flannery O'Conner - or even Harry Crews. They are deeper, uglier and more true than this perennial trifle."
1,Fun read but only an Ok book,"This book can be rated highly if it is used for scholarly purposes. It is easy to read, with good intentions, but outdated."
4,to kill a mockingbird teaches you about life,I thought that To Kill A mockingbird was a very godd book it was exciting all the way through the book. Scout was my favorite character and sort of reminds me of myself.
2,To Kill a Mockingbird 50th Anniversity Edition,"One of the joys of being a grandparent is passing on significant &precious experiences to our grandkids. I just gave my llyr old, avid reader my favorite book,""To Kill a Mockingbird 50 yr Edition. She'sa bit young but it's there for the days she picks it up. She too maylearn to love Aticus & family."
1,A hopeful theme,"If you like a slow calm plot but a great moral I highly reccomend this book. It is very slow, and ordinary life in an ordinary town but has a great powerful message."
1,...uh this book needs help!,"I read this book recently in class because it was requred reading. I love reading, and read several books a week. TKaM however was terrible. There is almost no plot, and the charecters were poorly developed and obviously fake. It gets boring after a few minutes, and is never all that exciting. It is also hard to follow what is going on near the end. It may be a classic, but it sure is not a good one!"
2,i do not like this book,"harper lee, to kill a mokingbirdfictionit is a sin to kill a moking birdthe book is about 2 boring kids who have meny experiancesin macomb county.it was to long for the story it tellsi would not recomind this BOOK TO ANY ONE"
1,Worst. Book. Ever.,"The title says it all. I was forced to read this book in the eigth grade, along with Romeo and Juliet and Things Fall Apart. Before you get on my case, let me just say this: the book is boring.Say what you will, but this never picks up. It starts out with Scout talking about how her brother once broke his arm. Who cares? The book's most exiting part is extremely confusing, and don't tell me I'm stupid; I have an IQ of 140. I personally prefer books that have something called action, such as Michael Chricton or Stephen King novels.If you're in for what Harper Lee calls a love story (even though there is no romance), go ahead and buy this book. If, however, you are like me, and you prefer something exiting, skip this."
5,To Kill a Mockingbird,I read this book several years ago and lost my copy along the way. My book club selected it for the Oct. meeting so I ordered it from Amazon. Haven't had time to read it again but look forward to doing so
5,"Still today, a compelling read","To Kill A Mockingbird is an ugly example of injustice where a black man in a segregated Alabama is falsely accused of attacking a white woman. While the racial divide was a profound theme in the novel, the dedication of the lawyer was memorable and has set the mark for many looking for their Addicus Finch when faced with a legal dilemma. Harper Lee, like her good friend Capote, is a provocative author rendering the organic sides of human nature both in tragedy and justice. It is no wonder really why this book has been around for over thirty years. Still today the readers of tomorrow would find it a compelling book."
5,This is a 10+++++++++++,"One of thee best, no explaination needed, this is a good gift for anyone or for a young adult of about 12+"
5,Title worth having in hardback,"Far better than the movie - more complex, more sympathetic to some the movie had to gloss over. Stands the time test, and reteaches us things that are worth remembering. Not really about the South as too many would characterize it - more like about humans, the way we act, the points we miss, and the ways we could be so much better."
5,to kill a mockingbird,Of course this is a classic and it is also a wonderful book to read. I love this book as I am sure many others do as well
3,Southern story,"The story takes place in the south of the United States, before civil rights were the same regardless of the color of people's skin. This society is examined through the eyes of a young girl whose father is a lawyer who defends a black man who has been accused of rape. Deep thoughts, slow plot. Maybe the movie has more action."
5,A really great book...,"So in the midst of reading some ""previously missed classics"" - The Great Gatsby and Catcher in the Rye amongst them - how nice to find one that genuinely deserves the title. Beautifully told story, great characters, emotion, suspense, and lots of feeling. Maybe tales off a little towards the end, but should definitely be required reading. At least, that's what I think..."
5,An aftermath of influence,"I first read Mockingbird when it was a new release, and read it again this past week. It's lost none of its magic.Actually I can say its influence extended far beyond what I'd originally thought, and has found its way onto the pages of my own book, Bridges by L.P. Sloan. While as a writer I have some disdain for comparisons, I make an exception when my book is compared to Harper Lee's. Mockingbird is a masterpiece of simple words and simple humanity, and it humbles me. The richness in its descriptions of the character's day-to-day lives achieves a depth and portrays an affection rarely found."
5,amazing! youll see everything in a new light,"I read this book for my 8th grade english class, and after i finished it, i could not stop thanking my teacher for making us read it. it truly gave me a different perspective on everything-people, places, things, and even ideas. my entire view of life changed, and i learned to appreciate things so much more. anyone can relate to it. ANYONE. if you havent read this, i seriously recommend it. it most certainly will not disappoint you."
4,Great Book,"I was fortunate enough to read To Kill a Mockingbird when I was in 9th grade. I didn't expect to enjoy it as much as I did. The book is absolutely amazing, but like most books, has a few boring parts. But that can be easily overlooked. My favorite characters were Atticus and Boo Radley, who, when we finally met him, was in my opinion, awesome. Definitely worth reading."
4,"""Hi Boo!""","This is a truly great novel. It's well-written, engrossing, poignant, and takes on a lot of the big issues from growing up to racism to fear and ignorance. It is at once complex in its themes yet simple to understand. As a result, it doesn't have that sense of deep untertone and vast implications one often associates with great literature. I respect Harper Lee's achievement in writing a true and important classic. At the same time, I often find myself drawn to more challenging works. I'm glad I read it--I liked it--but it didn't give me that feeling of a mental workout that I usually seek."
3,Give This Book A Try!,"TO KILL A MOCKING BIRD- Harper LeeThis is a fiction book with. I liked the book, but it wasn't one of my favorites. I would recomend this book to people who have a lot of patience. You may have to reread some parts to fully understand it. What I liked about this book was the dialogue. It made it feel like you were actually there having a conversation with the characters. I also liked the plot of the story. It was how a black man was convicted for something that no one could prove he did. What I disliked was the detail that the author went into. It good to go into detail, but not so much were the reader has trouble understanding. I found it hard to find out what characters he was talking about sometimes. He may have introduced too many too soon. Overall I think this book is a good one. It you dont like it at first, give it a chance. You might like it after all!"
4,Super City Quint,"This book is one of the best I have ever read. The book takes place many moons ago in the southern states. This book keeps you on the edge of your seat with scene such as Shootings, Rape, and Segregation. The characters are young and full of ambhition, and very misgevious.Once you pick up this book you wont be able to put it down."
5,Book,My very first purchase! I needed that book for school.Good condition and price. Amazon is amazing. I got excited when it came in the mail. Haha
5,Much More Than A Story,"To Kill A Mockingbird is much more than an average book. It provokes deep thoughts usually packed away in the deep recesses of your brain. It explores a small Southern town through the eyes of a young girl, something more authors should consider when writin. Because she is so innocent, you get to see how much of a difference the world is when you are a child. You don't know about addicition or racism or corruption, subjects Harper Lee tackles with ease. However, when said subjects are thrust upon you, sometimes it takes a loving father to beak it down to your level. This role is played by Atticus Finch. He is about as wonderful of a character as you can get, with his stern but caring attitude. This book should be commended for its details, never overlooking anything, and its character development. To Kill A Mockingbird is a must-have for anyone."
4,Who knew a classic could have been oh so totally cool...,"Who knew a classic could be oh so totally cool the first time you tried to read it back when you were 14. It made sense at 14, it makes better sense now. Harper Lee has an amazing story telling ability and she potrays the young girl Scout so well. Its almost as if the story was written from Scouts view. Incredible characterizations. Thats what really swept me off my feet, along with the amazing setting description. You could feel the heat, you could feel the hate, you can just really FEEL this book!"
5,Book report on To Kill A Mockingbird,"A most thought provoking and relevent theme, given the conflict between ethnic groups and countries around the world today.I love the way the author has woven different ideas and life issues throughout the story, as seen through the innocent eyes of a child, and combined them together to show the reactions of ordinary people to extraordinary events. A must for all young students and should be required reading for all politicians and world leaders around the world. My thanks to Amazon for their prompt and reliable service- I am able to enjoy this book, which was delivered a week before Christmas, through the long, hot summer holidays here in Australia. Keep up the good work!"
2,Do yourself a favor,"Do yourself a favor: do not buy this book. The storyline drags along. The only redeeming part is the emotional ending, which does do a good job of wrapping up the so called ""Classic""."
1,disappointing edition,"My order arrived as scheduled but the edition itself is disappointing. The advertised ""50th Anniversary Edition"" of Harper Lee's work, To Kill a Mockingbird, is small, measuring only 7""x4."" This book, with its worn- looking, discolored pages, rustically bound with red glue, contributes to the impression that it is an old volume left over from 1982, the date of the first mass marketing edition. This is not a criticism of the work itself, which I expect to be wonderful."
2,horrible condition!,I got this book to read for a class assighnment. i love the book as in the story but the pages had been like riped apart from the others and were very frayed. they were cut crocked and shreaded at the viewable ends. it was very dissapointing to recieve a very good story in a horrifying package. i would reccomend this book but not from this page. i would go purchase it from a store so you know what condation it is in. i would expect better from a 50th anaversy edition. p.s excuse my spelling please. i don't take time to correct my mistakes
2,To Kill a Mocking Bird,"IT depends on what type of book you like. If you like realistic fiction of the early 1900's, then this is your kind of book."
5,Entertaining and thought provoking,"This book is great on two levels. The first is that it's a great page turner. The second is that its wonderful universal themes, inspiring ideas, motifs, symbols, and characters depict the morals of society then and now."
5,Moving,"I was stuck for something to read on a long train journey and my eyes alighted on this book, you know, one of those books i have always 'meant to read' but never got round to. I gave it a shot and didn't put the book down for the whole journey, and most of the rest of the weekend. It is that good. No doubt the plot (coming of age, racism, honour) will be known to you, but it is written in such a simplistic way that it can't help to draw you in. Take some time out of your day and read this book, you will feel better for it and hey, you just might learn something about yourself..."
1,This book stinks!!!!!,This book is lacking creativity of chacters and of imagination of plot.Harper Lee has written a 281 page documentory of nothing. It uses unutterable words and displeasing language. I waw required to read this book and hope I will never have to read it again. It is a slow unresearched peice of literature that has been overated for years.
1,To Kill a Mockingbird,Harper Lee To Kill a Mockingbird Fictionthe theme was everyone should be treated equally.back in 1930's Alabama It mainly compared people to MockingbirdsIt was interesting and I thought was book was OKI agree that everyone should be treated equally
1,A Review From the Silent Minority,"Simply put, this is a novel about racism written for people who received their knowledge about racism from this book! There isn't a single insighful moment in this overrated piece of drek, and frankly it is an insult to intelligent readers everywhere...Filled with more stereotypes than an epidode of Good Times, this novel features the archetypal White hero with few flaws, his perfect children, the maid with just the right amount of ""colored wisdom,"" a black amn who is little more than a dullard, and the evil redneck who actually commited the crime! The problem with novels such as this is that instead of depicting reality, they present a world where minorities are at best well-meaning simpletons who need to be rescued by perfect white males from all those ""unenlightened"" white meanies! Kids should reads history texts...they're more entertaining."
5,just being a teen.,i think this book is very increatable it helps people cop with all the racism around them and i really enjoyed it.
3,to kill a mocking bird,A good book but not as good as the movie. The exact ending as to how the attacker was killed left too much doubt as to who actually was the killer--I don't think this was a good way to end the book. If Boo actually was the killer it should have been clearer to the reader instead of making the reader play a guessing game.
1,Not My Favorite,"I can see why some people enjoy To Kill a Mockingbird. It is very vocal about certain issues in life. I was completely bored reading this book. Although I liked Scout and Jem, I was not excited to read about a young girl's life in a small town. It seemed like a small plot and was not planned well. A court case is hardly a thrilling idea."
3,"Good but, not great!","I know everyone has to read this book sometime. I thought the book was boring......... As a parent I wish that there were ""classic"" books that our kids could read with out the language. I think it is sad that a writter has todrop to the level to use the degree of bad language to tell a story. To me it just says that they are very limited in their vocabulary. They story was long and drawen out. The subgect unfortunatleywas truthful durint time period for the south. Black vs. white"
1,Terrible,"I read this book recently in class because it was requred reading. I love reading, and read several books a week. TKaM however was terrible. There is almost no plot, and the charecters were poorly developed and obviously fake. It gets boring after a few minutes, and is never all that exciting. It is also hard to follow what is going on near the end. It may be a classic, but it sure is not a good one!"
3,"This book starts off slow, but gets exciting at the end.","Harper Lee did pretty well with the book To Kill a Mockingbird. At first, he started slow, introducing characters and telling stories about their past. When he got going, however, the book got very interesting. There was a trial involving a black man with one of the main characters as his lawyer. Of course, it was not a good thing at this time for a white man to be defending a black man in a trial. The trial becomes very exciting and brought the book to a great ending. As for the title, Atticus, the person who defended the man in the trial, told his children that you shouldn't kill a mockingbird because all they do is sing and provide entertainment for people. This quote tied in to the trial very well and made the book very effective. In conclusion, I do not reccomend this book for anybody under the age of fourteen."
4,Classic Read,"This was a required reading when I was in school. Teenagers need to be taught about morality,'gray areas' and compassion at home.This book deals with a single Dad raising his two children( advanced subject matter for its time,even though a single parent household is run of the mill today)This book teaches about judging someone based off of no knowledge at all ( Boo) and judging someone based off of their skin color( Atticus's client)This book is insightful and well written and does not lag anywhere.Harper Lee does a wonderful job bringing an era and experience to the reader.Another book I would recommend as a ' read together book'for you and your teen."
4,To Kill a Mockingbird Review,"This novel To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee, describes the courage and fear many of the characters display throught the book.The books setting was in the 1900's when racisim and diffrences made a border between black and white.The main character is a white girl named Scout in a small town in Maycomb County,Alabama.Scout's father, Atticus, is a lawyer and can tackle any case that comes his way.News spread throught the county that a black man had took advantage of a white woman.That woman was a part of a bad family and needed some attention.Atticus was appointed to defend that man, Tom Robinson.Will the countys differences be set aside for a mans future?Did this black man take advantage or did she cry wolf because of his race?The truth will come out in To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee."
3,prejudice,"Harper Lee is a great writer. This book is about how people can be prejudice against other people and how that affects some other people. I htink that this book would be boring to most people, but if you are really in to god books with a message hidden behind it, you should read this book."
5,Enchanting,Harper Lee deftly transports you to a sleepysouthern town where the mysteries of the grown-upworld are considered through the untainted eyesof youth. The larger questions of life are dealt with honestly and without cynicism. In its subtlety lies its beauty.
5,My favorite,A great book with all its philosphical questions... What makes it a very good book is its being told from the eyes of an innocent child.
3,Just another MOCKINGBIRD Review,"This book started rather slow for me. A lot of background. All the conversations amongst the kids was not necessary for me. I like how Scout tells the whole story, it really reads from a kids point of view. That was really creative. I think HarperLee was taking a stance on racial inequalities of this country. Readers would only listen to her speaking through a child. If Atticus had told the story, America wouldn't have been able to stomach how ugly life really is. Atticus is the strongest character in the book to me. This book was deep. I did enjoy it. If you haven't read it you've missed out."
5,AMAZING!!!!!!!,"This book was very well written! It is yet the best book I have ever read. Harper Lee is a wonderful author! This book made me want to keep turning the page, and never put the book down. Atticus never once gave up on that case. Even though it ruined his reputation he kept at it. It showed me that sometimes you may be rediculed for something, but keep at it. Fighting for what you believe in is the theme of this book in my opinion. When Scout and Jim found the items in the tree it showed them that someone cared. I recommend this book for anyone who is up for a great classic book. It isn't too long of a book, and it leaves you amazed. It puts a thought into your head that I cannot describe. It shows that we all face humility at some points in our lives, but to face those points with courage and bravery. Look life in the face."
5,A classic,"It's hard to say glowing things about ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" that haven't already been said. Atticus is such a beloved character that people name their dogs after him. And I would have to concur that Atticus is one of my favorite characters in literature. Father to Jem and Scout and an upstanding, conscientious lawyer in a small, racist Southern town, Atticus proves throughout the novel how important it is to stand up for what is right. Jem and Scout take heed. I also adore the movie, and Elmer Bernstein's soundtrack is a must have."
3,"The book, ""To Kill a Mockingbird""","I thought I was purchasing the book to download onto the Kindle. My daughter told me it would be the actual book. I have thought of returning it, but I may keep it and read it the old-fashioned way. My grandsons like the book also and i may pass it on to them."
4,mocking bird,Great book and glad to revisit after so many years. Read for my book club.Now I want to see the film again!
3,Not really all that good,"Although the contents of the book from a literary standpoint is superb, the reading by Sissy Spacek is average compared to other books on CDs I heard before. While she is reading from one character to another, her voice and accent does not change. It's like you are listening to the same person with a heavy southern drawl. It's rather confusing at times and difficult to listen to throughout the hold novel. I must say, Mrs. Spacek accent of ""Scout"" was excellent."
5,The Greatest Book Written,"This is, in my humble opinion, the greatest book. I love the story, the writing style, the characters, and the message. Growing up in rural Georgia, this book had a familiar feeling for me and a big impact on my life. My mother read it to me before I was old enough to read it myself. I read it again at school. I read it again from time to time because I enjoy it so. The message is an important one and valid for any reader. The characters are realistic and familiar, like people you may have known in your own life. A good, good book."
3,To Kill A Mockingbird,TThe book called To Kill A Mockingbird was an o.k book. I think that it wasnt fair that they killed tom they could have switched something in for that. But anyways as I was saying. it was very exciting though. my favorite part was when they were in the court....Suspense...if I had questions for the author I would ask him only this....why is the book called to kill a mocking birdie mean not to be rude.
5,To Kill a Mockingbird,"A timeless treasure full of chronicles of the ""old south"" circa 1935 and the ""new south"" as seen through the eyes of an eight year old girl. This author manages to descibe in detail the lives of her characters with such reality that one thinks that you know them as the neighbor from down the street.This depiction of racism gives us pause to explore the way courts were in the south during this time period;where women were not allowed to serve along with other lower class citizens.I read this book forty years ago when it first came out and it was just as enjoyable today."
4,"Even Though I had to read it for school, it was good","We had to read To Kill a Mockingbird for 9th grade. I was surprised at all of the allusions, and how deep the book actually went. There are a lot of themes that don't jump out at you all at once, and you have to re-read it to find them. I thought that this was a good book for high schoolers, but there are a couple remarks and ideas that aren't as great for middle schoolers to read. This is a good book and should be thought of as a classic."
5,what a beautiful story,wow! this is truly one of the greatest books written in the 20th century. it is well deserved the praise. it was later turned into one of the greatest films all time as well. it is a beautiful story about tolerance and racial prejudice. it also had probably the best Dad in the universe. i sure hope that someday i could be just as good of a father.
2,i dont understand,"i have to read this book for school. i have heard from my mother and a lot of other older people that this is a great book. i want to know why. it is true that i am only up to chapter 8, but this book is slow moving and boring. so far, i do not like this book. i am not like most people. i saw a beautiful mind, which has won 4 academy awards and i did not feel as if it should received that many. in order to do my homework i need to listen to any kind of music as long as its not classical or anything that doesnt have words. i get straight As but i do not study and i do not pay attention in class. true, there might be something wrong with me, but i just want to know why this is ""such a great book""signed,confused"
2,Boring,"For more than twenty-five years, To Kill a Mocking Bird by Harper Lee has been universally ingratiated into high school English programs. The repetitious dialogue; unhindered meandering; endlessly and needlessly branching plotline and much dated speech and setting has probably frightened more sophomores out of ever reading for fun than the Great Gatsby and Watership Down combined. But just because forcing teenagers to read a detailed account of growing up in 1930s Alabama is borderline child abuse does not mean there is nothing students can learn about good literature from To Kill a Mocking Bird. The characterization is presented masterfully; the descriptions are vivid; the narration is well done and it truly reflects the trials and tribulations of the time in which was written. To Kill a Mocking Bird is a fine piece of literature, but it's a terribly boring book."
3,Classic?,"I didn't see what the hype was all about. I mean it's a interesting point of view and alright plot. But I don't see why it's a ""favorite"". Oh well...it's on my shelf now."
4,To Kill a Mockingbird,"To Kill a Mockingbird, by Harper Lee, is an interesting and adventurous book. Simply about a small and forgotten town, Harper Lee makes you never want to put it down. Jem and his younger sister, Scout, go through many little adventures together, like seeing Boo Radley, watching the court in which Tom Robinson is trialed, and of course, getting attacked. Atticus, their father, has to make many hard decisions about racism and other things. If you read this book, you'll never look at a father to children relationship the same way again."
1,A glorified Paperback,"The book is the same size and materials as a cheap paperback. It just has a hard back cover, hardly worth the $12.51 price. It was listed as large print and it is not. Do not waste your money on this format."
3,it never came!!!,"hello amazon,i ordered my product on 9/11/2011, and today it is 10/13/2011. my product still has not arrived, and this incident has caused very much inconvenience to me. i feel inclined not to use Amazon as often anymore, and did not expect this. i hope you all realize how much inconvenience this has caused me, and hope that it wont happen again.Thank You."
2,"Library binding, but acid paper",I bought this edition for the library binding and was shocked when it had paperback quality paper inside. I will probably end up getting another copy with better quality paper.This edition is obviously intended for high school or college audiences.
2,Irritated,"I will not purchase from this vendor in the future. There are two pages in the book that have pieces missing; therefore, reading is interrupted. I emailed the vendor to please copy and forward those pages to me and my request has not been honored thus far. I have always purchased used books and have always been pleased. This book and vendor are both a huge disappointment."
5,The best book I've ever read!,"What is sad is if you read all the reviews on here you'll see one or two who slate the book without much reason. This book is a fantastic tale that shows racial and other prejudice for what it is: shameful. It's a shame not everyone can learn from this book and Atticus Finch! Give it a chance, buy this book!"
2,Book quality review only,"I will not be writing about the story, just the actual book.I am not happy with the quality of this book. I bought a book listed Acceptable with details as gentle wear and tear. I thought that would be binding wore a tad and slightly yellowed pages. No this book has 2 large creases on the front cover, all corners bent, and writing in/on the book. This should have been listed in the details."
3,summer reading,I had to read this for school during the summer. It was a good book yet very confusing at times. I would recommend this book only to strong readers.
2,Very small print & wrong picture on cover,Very small print. This is a different edition of the book with very small print. And the cover picture was different from the one shown.
2,To Kill a Mockingbird,"the copy I received had a signature on the fly page, which was indicated when I purchased it. However, there were underlines and comments throughout the book which were a bit distracting. However, the book itself deserved every award it received!"
3,It was very inspiring.,"At the beginning of the book, I didn't think it was very good and it was kind of boring. Once you get a couple of chapters into the book, you begin to understand why the book was written. The setting of the book was a little country town during the time when blacks and whites were not treated equally. The story is told by a little girl that is faced with many challenges and is discovering that the world can be really unfair."
5,To Kill a Mockingbird,This classic never gets old. I read it as a child and I still enjoy reading it to this day.
5,Excellent,Finally got around to reading this classic. Enjoyed it very much. The movie studio did a greatjob in casting Gregory Peck.
5,The quintessential enjoyable book,"I somehow managed to not find this book on required reading through the many different schools I attended and am most gratified that I was able to experience this with a few years of maturity added on. It's stunning to experience a book that elicits such a wide spectrum of emotion. The characters are fleshed out and practical in their roles with no trimming or additions needed. Atticus Finch is such a spectacle of honesty and integrity that , I'm afraid, it's too impossible for him to exist in real life. Following the day- to- day activities of Scout and her slightly older brother, Jem, around for a few summers makes me wish I had the childhood and upbringing they had in this story and I feel like I'm stung with such a bittersweet feeling caught in between laughing and crying. A plot synapsis is unnecessary. The writing flows so smoothly and easily you'll be holding most of the pages in your left hand quicker than any book you'll ever read."
5,Good condition,"I've read the book before in high school, need it again for college courses. Book came in excellent condition, looks like new, and was received in a very good amount of time. Would buy from again."
3,Uneven pages,"I expected this book to be of good quality considering it's a special edition. Honestly, I think I was sold a defective reject. The pages appear tattered because they were not trimmed to an even depth. I collect books; this one will not make it into my collection. To Kill A Mockingbird, however, is a fabulous classic."
5,How to Kill A Mockingbird,"I believe that this book is influential to me because it helped to open my eyes to understand how everyone should be thought of the same way with equality and given the same rights as everyone else. Tom Robinson was convicted of crime due to racism, which I believe is not right. As for Boo, people judged his book by his cover which was wrong after all. Boo is just like any other human; he's a person with feelings and thoughts just like everyone else. Before reading this book, I thought that ""How to Kill a Mockingbird"" wouldn't have caught my attention, when it really did."
5,Absolutely amazing.,"This book was on my reading list last year, and I wanted to read it. The only problem was, when I went to check it out of a library, there were no copies of it left! And now, I finally found out know why. This book is absolutely amazing.This is the story of a small Alabama town in 1935. It is told through the eyes of a girl nicknamed Scout, who is heartbreakingly frank about her feelings for her enviornment. The book reads quickly; you find yourself drawn into Scout's preceptions of the world around her, and you learn with her the injustices and surprises of life.I am sorry to say that life in Alabama hasn't changed much in the past 65 years. I couldn't believe how much I could relate to the book, being a native Alabamian myself (my city even get a mention :) ). With this book, I've found a way to explain to others what it's really like to live in the South."
5,Deserves the accolades,"Just reread this book for the umpteenth time and love it all over again. I first read it as a young teenager and knew even then that it was an important, near-perfect book. I understand that we all have different tastes, but I'm amazed that some few reviewers actually found the book boring. I can't help but doubt that it was really read and digested by them. If you haven't read it, do so. It's an absolutely wonderful book--a classic to be treasured. Thank heaven Harper Lee wrote it!"
5,One of the Best books I've ever read,"This book is ablsolutley outstanding. Using the point of view of a child it gives us an innocent standpoint through which to observe the effects of racisim. This book brings into light the good and bad in all of us and teaches us that the worst can be brought out in even the best people when society's views are as cruel and hateful as they were in this period of time. Since reading this book I don't think I've looked at things the same, in all honesty after reading this, no one truly can."
5,"HOOKED ON THESE ""MIGHTY""PASSIONATE BLUES","THIS IS A MASTERPIECE COLLECTION OF SONGS.WHEN I THOUGHT IT COULD NOT GET ANY BETTER,I BOUGHT THIS CD AND I MUST SAY IT IS OFF THE CHARTS.WHAT A GREAT RENDITION. SAM AND THIS INCREDIBLE BAND JUST BLEW ME AWAY.THE TRACKS,WHEN THE HURT IS OVER,AND IF YOU COULD SEE ME,ARE SO POWERFUL.SAM IS EVER SO PASSIONATE WITH THAT GREAT VOICE OF HIS.YOU MUST NOT FORGET THE BAND,THIS IS A GREAT CD TO ADD TO YOUR COLLECTION.5 STARS PLUS FOR SAM AND THIS BAND.LOVE IT,ALL 12 TRACKS."
2,Manic Meditation,"From the title and cover image, this book looks like it might contain useful and enlightening tips on making room for meditation during an active work day. And it does--for about four pages in the middle of the book. Otherwise, it's chock-full of esoteric practices like the laughing meditation (Sit on the floor and force yourself to laugh for an hour--who has time for that?). Dove's introduction is more telling than she realizes. As a freelance consultant, she has plenty of time to roll on the floor in forced hysterics. While I appreciated the mid-day mindfulness exercises and the gently encouraging tone in which they're written, there's little else of value here for the on-the-go professionals that are the book's target."
5,Definitely what I would call a dream!,"As soon as I listened to the first phrase I was hooked! Not only does Ms. Meyer have a beautiful voice but you can tell that each song, whether comedic (Miss Byrd is hysterical) or serious is sung from the heart. The musical arrangement by Wes McAfee is terrific. In summation, buy this CD. You won't regret it."
3,Was required for a class,Not really something that I would buy for general reading. Had to have for a class that I am taking.
5,The BEST album ever!,"When i saw InMe in kerrang i thought they looked really metal and was apprehensive about them. And then my mum went and bought me the album for christmas which was a bit dissappointing. But as soon as I heard the first song, I fell in love with them. The lead has the most awesome voice and they can do a variety of tracks. From slow, but emotional rock to powerful guitar anthems. I love InMe. They rule!!! BUY IT"
4,nice looking watch - stem doesn't work properly,"This watch looks great but I've had a problem trying to change the date with the stem. It seems that there is no intermediate position for the stem - only in or out. Other than that, I'm happy."
2,weight training,"This product would be good for someone who did not know the basics about dryland, but for someone with a solid background in weight training, it offered nothing I did not already know. ""Ultimate"" is a misnomer, a better title would be ""Basic Fundamentals of Weight Training"". The approach was very old-school, I was looking for more updated training techniques. I found ""Complete Conditioning for Swimming"" by Dave Salo to be far superior."
2,Acceptable for a beginner but that's about it,This book is NOT for anyone with a weight lifting background. I am a varsity swim coach with a weight traning background who bought this book hoping for new ideas. There were none. The book is rife with typos and the pictures are poor quality. The book also suggests overhead presses and behind the neck pull-downs; both of which are poor choices for anyone a good deal of yardage. Pictures show lifts like bent over barbell rows done with feet together when most people will suggest a wide base with feet shoulder-width apart for added stability. This book is not for a beginning swimmer. It is not for a coach or swimmer with moderate knowledge of weight lifting. I can think of very few people who would benefit from the content of this book even if it were accurate.
1,Do not waste your money.,"The book is a pathetic collection of cuts and pastes, very poor quality black and white pictures, and a bunch of pages filled with meaningless charts. Its a rip off."
4,Elsie's Womanhood ( a new adventure!!!),"Meet Elsie Dinsmore a heroine of the 1860's.Elsie marries Mr. Travilla,a kind-hearted man.When they go to Viamede for a Honeymoon,Tom Jackson ( really the fake Mr.Egerton) is still trieing to steal Elsie's heart. This causes a catastrophe!!!!! Elsie also gives birth to three children. :)Kelsey B. :)P.S. May be too much for 9 & under."
4,Full of good ideas!,This book is full of good ideas written by people who know! The articles are short and most worthwhile for anyone who wants to know what happened at the last election and what might be done next time! I have rated it only four stars because the book itself is hard to hold and the print is too close to the spine to open wide enough.
3,Good book but there are better ones.,"I enjoyed this, but the David Howarth book 1066 The Year of the Conquest is so much better that I am sorry I read the Marren book."
5,Best Scissors,I really like these. They're extremely sharp and with their small tips are perfect for snipping through the backing of any long pile fake fur I use in stuffed toy-making without cutting into the fur itself. I also really like the handle size for having such small tips. It's more comfortable to grip and it's a lot harder to lose them.
5,handy scissors,"These scissors are sharp, which is what I needed. They work great! I use them for fabric and ribbon cutting and it works well."
5,Great scissors,"These are excellent scissors for cutting out intricate shapes, for people over 50 years of age, they were promptly delivered and a very reasonable price."
1,blade broke off the second time I used them!,"I am disappointed! I have used Fiskars for years. The blade popped off when I used them to cut poster board. I thought the blade and handle would be one solid piece, but they are just attached to handles with plastic."
4,"Brief review of ""The Rawhider""","Based upon the above review, I decided to buy and read this novel by Doyle Trent, and I am very glad I did so.This is a well-plotted story that took me from the first few pages and held me all the way to the end. The characters are well drawn, and the writing style brings the Colorado setting to life.This is one of Trent's better books, and I highly recommend it."
5,The Founder of the Neo-Friesian School,"As a high school student, Leonard Nelson rediscovered the forgotten German philosopher Jakob Fries, the political activist and rival of G.W.F. Hegel in the years after Napoleon. Nelson thought that Fries had done what no other philosopher had done: retained and extended the spirit and system of the philosophy of Immanuel Kant, the greatest modern philosopher. Tragically, Nelson died young in 1927. But he had written a great deal; and his students, often from exile to escape the Nazis, preserved his memory and published his unfinished books. ""Socratic Method and Critical Philosophy"" was published by Yale in 1949, containing Nelson's most popular and accessible essays and speeches."
3,Pictorial History,"Great historical value, but I must admit for the price I expected far more detail. It does have a good set of reference photos, particularly for the historian and modeller, as the Prinz Eugen had somewhat of a distinguished career being a partner to the Bismarck and a A-bomb Test bed for the USA. It does lack good line drawings and interior detail for the Class which I would expect for the price."
4,"Though it's an old book, it's still good information","This is an oldie, but a goodie. I wish a similar book was written in this decade. Each chapter is written by an established writer, covering such subjects as research, interviewing techniques, reselling articles to several sources, submitting manuscripts and many others. If you substitute ""computer"" and ""laser printer"" for each mention of a typewriter, a lot of the information is still usable."
5,You'll love this CD!,"Well, you can throw away those awful ""Stage One"" CDs now. ""Out on Broadway"" is what we've all been waiting for -- cool, exciting, funny, sweet, moving gay takes on great theater music. These guys have more energy than the whole ""Stage One"" series put together. The best tracks are a SIZZLING ""Sooner or Later,"" a sexy sexy ""Sleepy Man"" (with gorgeous back-up) and a big fabulous ""You Are the Light"" finale. But really, every track is a gem. This CD totallky rocks!"
2,Amateur Hour,"Is it just me or does no one else notice the numerous pitch problems that occur on this recording? I applaud the efforts and premise of this production by the producer and performers; but a concept does not a recording make. The voices often do not blend and the soloists are often amateurish in their renditions of very sophisticated material. This sounds like a benefit night at a local church -- not a CD that cost me [$] There is definitely a market for this concept; just a little more polished and professionally done, please."
2,Derivative,"""Waking up to you"" is a blatant ripoff of Elliott Smith's ""Somebody that I used to know"". I do not believe that they should be profiting from his intellectual property."
2,Bizarre,"My husband tried this book first, and abandoned it after a couple of chapters - far too far out. I gave it a try and didn't even last that long. I did check further into the book, to see if the plot did bear some resemblance to the blurb on the back, but it really did not seem to. Maybe I had to read further to discover Sable Keech. All I read was about some ravenous and murderous creature called Vrell."
3,"Enjoyable Asher, but below Polity Par","Neal Asher has recently entered my own personal sci-fi hall of fame. His writing skills are superb and his novels are invariably entertaining. This novel slightly disappointed me, it not being on the same scale as Line of Polity or Brass Man (or its predecessor, Skinner, for that matter). There were too many subplots; and the major plot was not given enough emphasis to standout, and I was left behind, trying to pick up pieces and put them together. All in all, I was left with the impression of hurry.I have to say though, his characters are thoroughly enjoyable and very real, and I never pass up a chance to read his novels."
4,Damien Rice's Odd Gems,"Enough has been said, lauded, and expressed in amazement of this young man's talent, both musically and lyrically. Certainly ""O"" was one the greatest debut CDs in a long., long time, and wanting more from him is the inevitable feeling you probably were left with, after listening to his first full album.Now comes, not the first, but possibly the best EP released in the wake of ""O."" Most selections included are either unreleased demos (""Lonelily""), sketches of songs you'll know (""Volcano""), great live stuff (""The Professor & La Fille Danse"" or ""Delicate""), and, probably, represent the best of this EP.Among the several EPs Damien Rice has released over the last twelve months, I consider ""b-sides"" to be his most satisfying one, and representative of Rice's deep talent and promising career."
2,It's not the user it IS the product.,"The people with problems with these are not ""uncordinated"" or stupid but here is a problem with this product at black rubber ""O"" ring seal at the spout working out of place. Unfortunately when this happens the seal is often damaged. In it's infinate wisedom Coleman has chosen not to make the seal available despite the fact that it is easily replaceable. When the product works it is great and I really like mine to the point I am looking at hardware stores to find a replacement seal that might be fitted to stay in place. The old jugs did not do this - are new ones made in China or something???????"
1,Leaks Like Crazy!,"This jug leaks no matter how you tight you close it. I bought two Coleman jugs at once--1/2 gallon and 1/3 gallon and they both leak. In the car I have to make sure they don't lean over even slightly or the seat will be wet. And not just a little bit, but really wet. I put some juice in one and then put it in a plastic bag, which was lucky because most of it came out when the jug got jostled in travel. I really don't enjoy having the water dribble down my chest while I'm drinking out of the spout. It's surprising how very much it leaks, really. We're not talking a few drops here, but a steady stream.I bought them because they seemed like a bargain at the price, but they were definitely not worth it. The point of a jug with a screw-on lid is to keep the liquid in there until I open it. They don't do that and it's very frustrating. Do not buy this because you will only regret it. Coleman usually has good products, but on this one they really blew it."
3,Good book!,This is a very nice book unless it's not too diferent from others on the same subject. I think it needs more links with digital techniques.
4,The gold standard of basic fryers.,"I have had my own fry daddy for 6 years now, and my grandmother has had hers for over 20. Still the same basic quality fryer. Simple heat and fry. It has no lid or filter to filter the smell and prevent splatterlike some of the fancy models, this is just plain frying. Best rules, If frozen don't just drop the item in fast, and I tend to use this more in the warmer weather, when I can have my windows open. If you have a good Hood above your stove, that can be helpful as well. Otherwise, tasty food quickly, I still love my fry daddy. Its affordable and reliable."
2,Spend the extra money,"No basket to pull out fried food, no temp control, no frills. Spend the extra money and get something you will like, unless you fry once or twice a year."
4,Fry Daddy rules even when drunk!!!!,"I got the Fry Daddy for Christmas. I wanted some ridiculous, expensive deep fryer but all I communicated to my boyfriend was ""I want a deep fryer"". He bought me this. I was skeptical at first and didn't use it until now - two months after Christmas. Well, I've been drinking tonight -not a lot- but still, I wanted a funnel cake. Luckily I had a ""just add water"" funnel cake mix. I just made one and it was sooooooooo easy to do - less than a minute! Then I remembered that I had some frozen perogies and decided to deep fry those. Also delicious!! Yeah, the Fry Daddy doesn't have a thermometer but I just used a candy thermometer to make sure the temp was right. Both items came out perfect, even after a few drinks...hehe. It may not be fancy but, it does what it needs to. YUM!!!"
5,FryDaddy,Had a fast delivery and unit was as advertised.Presto 05420 FryDaddy Electric Deep Fryer. Very satisfied with the unit.
2,not good~~!!,"As soon as i got this item, i tried to cook. But, i was kind of disappointed with it.First of all, oil is too hot. i knew that there is no temperature control. However, i just expected it'd keep proper temperature while frying something. Even the food i fried burned too much even though it took less than 3minutes to fry.Secondly, the exterior is too hot. Just Watch it out~~!!lastly, the spatula it came with is useless. Unlike picture on the box, it is made by plastic. Since oil is too hot, plastic spatula might cause be harmful substances."
4,Amazon Price is extremely high,"Nice unit. It is available at your local WalMart for $17.96. You do pay sales tax, but no shipping. Amazon started out as a lower price alternative, but their price for this is nearly 50% above the local price."
2,Scary to use,I used the proper amount of oil but it still bubbled over. I made calamari rings and at first it seemed to be fine. After the first batch however it started bubbling up and I had to quickly spoon out the bubbling oil to keep it from making a huge mess on my counter. It gets scary hot in seconds which I like but the bubbling over not so much. I know water can cause bubbling and steam so I dried the squid before I dipped it in the batter. Unfortunately I threw out the box. I would've returned it.
3,not insulated,"The fryer is very simple: a pot on a hot plate. As such, you can't touch the pot because it is not insulated in any way and you need your own splash guard/ metal lid of some kind. The rubber lid that comes with the unit is only for storage. The spatula that comes with the unit is very effective but I use my own metal tongs anyway.In short, you can fry just about anything small for two people within about seven minutes."
5,Presto Fry Daddy,"Does everything it should, and does it well. Takes up very little counter space;heats up quickly and produces finely fried foods that are not greasy."
4,Great basic fryer. The standard of the field,"I have had my own fry daddy for 6 years now, and my grandmother has had hers for over 20. Still the same basic quality fryer. Simple heat and fry. It has no lid or filter to filter the smell and prevent splatterlike some of the fancy models, this is just plain frying. Best rules, If frozen don't just drop the item in fast, and I tend to use this more in the warmer weather, when I can have my windows open. If you have a good Hood above your stove, that can be helpful as well. Otherwise, tasty food quickly, I still love my fry daddy. Its affordable and reliable."
5,Fry-a-Rama!,"Perfect size to make a smallish batch of fried food. Since its recent purchase we've made fried pickles, wontons, egg rolls, battered veggies, and samosas. It's been an easy, splatter-free process. Just fill about half-way with oil (we use canola) and give it a few minutes to warm up. You can have a second batch frying while you eat the first, should you want more. Let cool first, put on the lid, and that's it. I like that there's no temperature knob, no guessing involved. Just heat and eat."
2,"It works, but....","It will fry, but:you have find a lid to cover itthere is nothing that will tell you that you're ready to frythe bottom gets very hot"
3,FryDaddy Fryer Works Great!,Presto 05420 FryDaddy Electric Deep FryerIt works great. It does exactly what it is supposed to do...fry foods..and it does it well! It is a good purchase.
4,Great fryer,"This fryer works great and is totally worth the money because of the extra safety features. I especially love the lid to store oil that I would rather throw out the next day. My only complaint is that it says it fries 4 servings. In the Deep South, we call this single serving size."
5,My second one!,"A terrific product at a great price. It was almost impossible to find in the stores...so many other brands have jazzed up fryers making them too big, too pricey, and too complicated. The best bargain for it was at Amazon!"
5,Deep Fryer,What a wonderful little product this is. We use it often. Frying foods in the FryDaddy is wonderful because it gives you the opportunityto remove the food and drain the oils off it. LOVE IT. USE IT OFTEN and have bought one for my daughter.
1,absolutely horrible,"Worst product I ever bought, also the most dangerous. I have three small children and this is not something you want sitting on your countertop without a lid. Brought it home and used it to deep fry mozzarella sticks and my whole house smelled like a greasy restaurant kitchen for 2 days. The body gets VERY hot, due to no insulation, takes forever to cool down, and it comes with a puny little slotted spoon to get your food out, where the food falls off as you're lifting it and plops back into the fryer and splashes oil all over. The worst $15.00 (Walmart) I ever spent. Brought it back the next day"
2,This is not good for families with young children,"This deep fryer is a basic deep fryer for college people or people that just got married, its not good for families with very young children or elderly because of splatter all over the place and its hot and no basket, this is only good for simple things like chicken nuggets, chicken tenders and fries and onion rings and something small to fry up.I have asked a family member to get me a deep fryer for Christmas and they got me this and we are both disapointed on this deep fryer, yes it does the job well done and the chicken we had in it was great tasting but, my husband had to defrost the chicken because when you put frozen chicken in this it went all over the place, the last deep fryer we had had a lid and handle on it and it was more safer then this.Again if you have small children in the house or your elderly and also disabled you should avoid this deep fryer and get a better one just a heads up."
1,Unsafe!,"We ordered this to use to make french fries now and then. It arrived quickly, with no manual inside (original packaging ordered directly from Amazon). We figured we just plug it in and get frying...I plugged it in and poured the oil in and started working on the rest of dinner. I have small children so I thought I should probably move the fryer further in on the counter, so I pushed it with my thumb and forefinger...Two 2nd degree burns and a trip to the emergency room later, this thing is going in the trash!How could a name brand fryer not have a warning that the black matte finish on the outside of the unit gets as hot as the inside?!?!? I just assumed (wrongly, I know) that the sides were insulated and that as long as I was careful not to splash the oil, I'd be fine.I'm shocked."
1,Daddty Fryer useless need Mommy Fryer,"Purchased this fryer to make donuts. Discovered it did not have a temperature gauge and when frying donuts, it burned them on the outside and they were totally raw on the inside. Total waste of dough and oil. Returned to store as can't imagine what one could use this for. When it comes to frying, Mommy knows best,.....not Daddy."
1,unpleased,it was a lot smller than i thought it would be but it cooks very small batches of food it would be perfect for a couple or a single person not a big family.
2,Deep Fryer,"The temperature control on this item was either faulty, or non-existant. Food got really brown on the outside and was hardly cooked on the inside. I do not recommend this product at all."
2,Smaller capacity than expected,Product is made ok but is smaller than I expected. You can't cook too much at once.
1,Cord attachment: very poor design,"The cord attachment has short prongs and the cord is held against them by a magnet in the plug. This makes a loose and dangerous connection likely to spark. The plug is easily knocked loose. I don't suppose that this would meet any safety standards. The cord is too short and if you put any tension on it trying to reach a wall plug, the magnetic plug comes loose. Since magnets are weakened by heat, as the unit is used more the connection will become looser. For the moment though, it works OK is a convenient little deep fryer, but the cord attachment needs to be changed! So I would up grade my star rating, but the editor won't let me. Read both good and bad reviews before buying this product."
1,deep fryer,"this is a clumbsy product. The power cord does not snap into place, it is held in place by a magnet connection. It falls out of contact with the slightest movement or shaking of the cord. The heat shuts off and whatever you're cooking, stops cookig. I don't recommend this product to anyone.It takes forever to heat up. Once heated properly, it cooks OK.There are much better fryers on the market, this is not a good one."
1,No off switch?,"I owned one of these for years and never thought twice about it, until a few weeks ago when our power went out. Several hours later after the oil cooled I put the lid on, and of my own admission, did not think to unplug the fryer. Several more hours later, after the power came back on, I woke up to a strange oily smell, went downstairs and found that the fryer had turned back on, heated the oil and MELTED the lid! Talk about a fire hazard. The thing has no OFF switch... if it's plugged in... it's on. The next morning it went right in the trash."
1,get something different,"I tried this the first night that I received it. I was very excited-even though were not to eat fried foods. But the first night, after pluged in and oil getting hot. The electric fryer died.. I returned it the next day. Very disapointed......Decided not to get another deep fryer"
1,condition of item when opened,I ordered this item as a Christmas gift in November. It sat unopened until Christmas morning when my daughter discovered that it was dented beyond use. Fortunately I saved the packing slip and she graciously said that she would take care of handling the problem. She said that she expected excellent service and I hope that she is right. All other orders placed have always come in pristine condition.
1,box ruins the surprize,This was the big present for the foreign exchange student staying with us. He is taking a cooking class and lamenting the lack of a fryer in the house to make his native dishes. But he brought in the packages today and this box has nothing but huge advertizements all over it. So he knows exactly what his present is. There is no way to make this a surprise gift for anyone in your house. I am so angry and disappointed. We knew he would be expecting a sweater or something and to be totally surprised on Christmas morning. I would return it but that would be a problem now too. We have no good options. Don't have it sent to your house.
5,Perfect for Us.,Have used this to fry home-made donuts and it worked great. The cooking temperature stayed even and the clean up was easy. Great product for our family. Would purchase again or for someone else in family.
5,One drawback,We love this. The only drawback is the ladle. It doesn't drain well and consequently you can get a lot of oil on the serving plate.
3,I wish it was bigger.,"I like to cook fish on my deck for friends and family, I wish the fryer .was . bigger. other than that I love it."
2,Nice idea but....,"Nice idea but does not get hot enough. By my fry thermometer it tops out at 290 degrees F. This is to low for proper frying, sorry."
1,Does not heat up properly,"Use the product within the 30days from when Amazon delivers because I did not and when I finally used it about 45 days after I got it, the fryer did not heat up properly. I have contacted Presto directly (after Amazon told me I was out of luck with them taking it back or replacing it) and sending it to Presto may end up costing me more to fix it than I paid for it. Very unhappy with Amazon not being more helpful since I have purchased 100's of items from them but in their defense I did wait longer than their return policy to find out it was defective."
1,Too small and broke down quickly,"The fryer is very small, so as you cook subsequent batches, the previous batches gets cold. It's very basic: no temperature control, no indicator light for when it has reached the correct temperature, no basket (just a wide slotted spoon) and no insulation, so you do have to be careful around it. That would have all been OK for the occasional deep fryer user like myself except for something so basic, you would think there wouldn't be much that could go wrong with it. However I only used it about 10 times before it stopped working completely."
3,Nice but...,"This is perfect for small things you might want to deep fry a single serving worth. Egg Rolls, wontons, etc. Made so you can just put the whole thing in the fridge, apparently... but the downside is, why a plastic lid on a deep fryer?! It should have been something that could put up with some heat so I could keep it covered while cooking."
5,Perfect size for the single person,"Although this is not a family sized fryer, it is the perfect size for the single male who loves his hot wings!"
1,Unsuitable,"On first use this unit heated oil to 400F. During cooking it never dropped below 380F. Because it was so high, I checked with two thermometers.My Chicken Fried Steak came out a mahogany color, and the crust had a definite burnt flavor. The frying oil was burnt, not reusable, and oil is not cheap.Most authoritative cookbooks recommend 320 to 365F for deep frying. The highest smoke point of readily available shortening is around 350-360F, Crisco recommends not to exceed 365F, only canola and peanut oils are above 400F.I would put the ideal temperature at no more than 350F, 50F less than this fryer.Presto Customer Service said I should only use canonla oil (contrary to the enclosed instructions) and if that was not satisfactory, I should return the unit.I was disappointed and surprised after good reviews."
3,Small but gets the job done,"This fryer is small and you can't cook very much food at a time. Every time I have made fries I have to do about 3 separate batches to make enough for 4 people. There also is not a thermometer so you can't tell how hot the oil is. If I were to buy again, I would spring for a bigger one that you can monitor the temperature. Other than that, it works great and heats oil fine."
5,frydaddy,Great value for $24.99 and the quick power disconnect is a must have for products in this category.
4,This could be the greatest thing ever!,The Fry Daddy is amazing! It deep fries just about anything quickly and completely. A temperature control would be a nice touch but other than that: Perfect!
4,great,"frying became a lot easier with this. we should have bought it long time ago. This doesn't have a temperature controller but still works fine.new model released with it. if you think of buying this, go get new model with temp. controller"
5,Perfect size.,Our last one lasted over 20 years. This is the perfect size for a family of 2-4. Doesn't take up much shelf space.
5,Perfect for two person meals,It is just the right size for a meal for two. It is also easy to clean and storage is no problem for small kitchens
2,Fry Daddy,It is a lot smaller than I expected it to be.I have to do double or triple batches of food.It is only good for one serving.
4,"Ken Wilson takes the viewer ""down under"" for hunting adventure.",Ken Wilson has produced a number of these films. He has hunted all over the planet for big game trophies and his films are always very interesting and educational. By educational I mean to say that the animals are described in detail along with trophy qualities and assortment of details to look for in an exceptional animal. Australia has no native deer. These deer have been brought in from other nations yet they're thrived in Australia and Tasmania. Ken explains all this is his friendly and like-able manner. What I like most about this DVD: 1) the exotic and foreign lands 2)the quantity and quality of these animals rarely viewed outside of zoos 3) the ethical hunts for these marvelous animals. Watching hunting videos is not for everyone. But this film is a refreshing break from the countless amateur videos featuring shooting of wild hogs and whitetail deer in a southern USA environment.
1,Williams can do SO much better!,"I got this tape in an attempt to find something worthwhile to show my Jazz History class. Sadly, there's little here of factual ""history"" about Scott Joplin. The dialogue and direction were pretty poor, events jump from one to another with little explanation of what happens in between, and Billy Dee Williams' acting is terrible. I grant that he's pretty young here, but still...I'm going to chalk it up to a poor script, because I know he can do MUCH better than this stinker. Add to that the fact that he is awful at faking his piano playing, and there really isn't much that's believable about this film. As a history it's worthless, and as entertainment it's stilted & dry. If you like Joplin's music, buy a CD and a book biography, you'll get much more out of them."
3,Scott Joplin Biography Motion Picture 1977,"Scott Joplin (1977) is not a TV movie as described in another reviewers article below. This bio pic of the great ragtime composer was theatrically release in 1977 by Universal Pictures. It did eventually show on NBC TV in 1978. Scott Joplin was a joint venture between Universal Pictures and Motown Productions.However the director Jeremy Kagan did do a lot of TV films. He also has worked with Art Carney in the film ""Katherine"". His best known film would probably be ""The Chosen"" with Robby Benson. This is probably why the film does have a ""TV movie"" type feel to it.While ""Scott Joplin"" does not have the authenticity that the subject here deserves. In does actually have some unique and rare performances that are well worth seeing. I would recommend it based on the performances by Eubie Blake, Seymour Cassel, a small role played by Lionel Richie, as well as a special cameo by acclaimed director Samuel Fuller."
1,bad product,"I was so excited to get this tea pot. I got it out of the package washed it according to directions and filled it with water to boil. much to my suprise I lifted the lid while it was on the burner and some of the enamel coating came off in my hand! Im trying to figure out how to get my money back, definately not worth the 20.00"
1,Not What I expected,"I ordered this sometime last year. It arrived very quickly; however, I received Madonna's ""True Blue"" album itself and not the True Blue single, on Blue Vinyl as depicted. I left on a trip and completely forgot to contact the seller that I was not given what was advertised. Unfortunately, this is my fault and I have to live with what I received. Nonetheless, because I received the wrong item, this seller receives ONE star. For the record, the album I received was in good condition, but it's not what was advertised!!!"
4,Lighthearted fun,"This lighthearted cartoon book looks at the guilty and martyrdom in each of us. Most of the cartoons relate to mothers, of course,since they are the greatest martyrs...and wear it so well! It's acute book that's a quick read, but with some messages.I found the messages a bit confusing or oblique in some of the cartoons, but otherwise it was a fun romp through the topic. It's a good gift book--in fact, I know just who I'll give it to!The author, Linda Edgecombe, is a sought-after professional speaker from Canada. She's recognized for her expertise in humor and inspiration. Get ready for some chuckles!"
3,"Stew Granger is an excellent actor, BUT ...","... I didn't feel he was really into his performance in this movie, the way he was in 'Scaramouche'. This movie, for me, was just 'okay', not horrible, not great, just somewhere in between. I own this movie, and I will watch it again, but I must say I'm not in any particular hurry to do so. I would like for the 2006 James Purefoy version to show up on dvd. As for this version, I imagine it will be on dvd once Purefoy's version comes out.Part of my problem with this movie is (and it is not the movie's fault) I'm not a big fan of Elizabeth Taylor. She's okay, but I just can't get thrilled with her for some reason. And, Stewie Granger just didn't put himself into this movie the way he did in 'Scaramouche', at least I didn't think he did. I just felt like he didn't care that much about this movie to bother putting in a noteworthy performance.On the 1-10 scale, I'd put this movie somewhere between 6.5 and 8.0. Good, not bad, but not great or outstanding."
1,A waste of money for sweet eating ants.,I put these traps right on the ant trail and waited a week. The ants went around them. These baits are supposed to be for both grease and sweet loving ants so I wondered what kind I had.I put a tiny dab of honey down and watched. The ants quickly found it and wouldn't leave it alone.I then cut open one of the traps and using a toothpick but a dab of each bait and a dab of honey on a piece of paper and watched. The ants were again drawn to the honey. But as I watched they'd sample each of the Raid baits and move on.I've tried the Terro liquid ant bait and my ants really like it. I'll be picking up some Terro liquid bait traps tomorrow.
2,"If you have ants already, it is too late to use this!","It is pointless to use these traps if you have ants already. Ants don't even enter these traps, let alone eat the poison.The carpet in my appartment was poorly laid (especially around the stairs) and as a result, ants began showing up in my room around early summer. Most traps that I used required a knowledge of where the ants were coming from, and I has no idea.I would suggest using the liquid ant killers (I think the one I got was from tera). All you do is put a small amount of liquid on a piece of cardboard and wait for the ants to eat.I found exactly where the ants were coming from by using this because all the bate was gone the next morning. I used the earth friendly RAID after that and it took care of the problem. I am still surprised it worked as well as it did so quickly considering how many ants were crawling around."
1,RAID ant bait is Peanut Butter ????????,This product is such a rip..I usually use Terro and it works great..store out so I bought these crappy things. The ants went out of their way to avoid these and when I opened it up (OOOOOO big no no) it was full of peanut butter. I have never had a ant steal all my peanut butter. 1/4 oz peanut butter for $2.99..Crappy deal for me..Great deal for Raid.
4,Here's the trick...,"I was worried after seeing so many terrible reviews that the Raid traps I just bought wouldn't work (as my ant problem was rapidly getting worse). I agree that, out of the box, the traps don't encourage the ants to enter and ""feed"" from them.The trick is, you have to cut open the trap, remove the bait and smear it onto a flat piece of paper (hopefully you don't have pets or children that can get into it), but after I did this the paper was swarming within minutes and just one day later - No ants!"
1,My ants are not interested in Raid but love Terro,"I tried to force them to walk through these traps but they don't care. Maybe my ants aren't Egyptian since I live off the east coast of the US (See the only 5 star review). I tried the Terro liquid traps last year with some success, I just ordered some more from Amazon since the local store is out. 2 days later... I found some Terro traps left over from last year after I wrote the first part of the review. My ants flocked to the Terro liquid bait stations and today are scarce. I wouldn't bother with these or the single bait Raid traps."
3,Good book... but there are weaknesses,"There is a lot of good information contained within this book from the many contributing authors. You can learn a lot of little ""tricks"" to help you in circuit design. However, many of the contributors get a little carried away with their own personal histories and design biases. I would like to have seen a few more of the design methods and ideas, that the authors have learned over the years, included in the book. Most of the authors are straigth forward in their design philosophies and explanations. However, some of the authors spend pages talking about how, ""...they don't even own a computer, much less use it for design...,"" type of philosophies. This is just plain arrogance on the part of the author and does not help the reader. If the author had used the same page to talk more about how he optimizes a circuit's design, the book would have received a much higher mark from me. Overall, it's not a bad book despite these small shortcomings."
3,Reviewer from Salt Lake is right on,"I agree completely with the reviewer from SLC: there are some interesting insights, but too much ego invested in personal memoirs and irrelevant anecdotes of personal history."
3,"Neutrogena aok, but still like Clean & Clear Mattifier better","The Neutrogena Mattifier works ok, but I think Clean & Clear's mattifier worked better. Unfortunately, Clean & Clear discontinued their product. Perhaps my opinion is based on initial application. Neutrogena goes on feeling a little slickery or greasy, and it initially makes your skin feel greasy, too. Whereas Clean & Clear goes on feeling clean and dries almost immediately. And your face feels completely grease free almost all day. I'll probably try other mattifiers before I come back to Neutrogena's again."
1,Melted,This product was completely liquid and oily when it arrived--rather than in the form it should have been which is a cream like consistency to smooth on face. It was unusable.
2,Neutrogena Mattifier,"Disappointed. Have used Lancome powder gel for shine control for years, but it isn't always available. The Neutrogena product does not control shine, in fact it puts on a somewhat greasy layer on your face."
5,Our tandem was a different bike with these!,I had no problem mounting these tires and pumped to 100psi they perform great! Combined weight on our aluminum Mongoose Wanderer tandem is around 370lbs and we both noticed big improvements in efficiency and agility.
4,Coppertone Bug & Sun,We have used Coppertone Bug & Sun for as long as it has been on the market and have not found a better product anywhere. With one application before riding we are protected from both bugs and sunburn all day. Definitely a product to use.
5,Required reading for the Tibetan antique dealer or collector!,This beautiful book offers much more than a generous selection of wonderful photographs! It is historically informative and well organized so that it is easy to read for both the professional and collector. If you are interested in Tibetan antique furniture-this is the publication for you!
2,You'd better like quasi-random electronica,"Heard slicker in a bar. liked it: electronic lounge-ish. But these remixes are seriously different. Perhaps it will grow on me, but..."
3,Good Tasty Fun,"This book has not only food recipes that are very tasty, but the stories and anecdotes were amusing. A great gift idea for those single guys who need cooking and dating pointers."
4,"Great Scenery, Dry Humor, and Panache","This movie is a winner. It has some moments of humor and a poignant message in the end. It is an obvious throwback to 60's thrillers and has many references to the 60s. However, it does have some innovative filming techniques. Unfortunately, the director overdoes it in the beginning of the film with the constant flashbacks and flashforwards to the point of agony, but then once you reach the 15 minute mark things settle down and it becomes a very watcheable and entertaining vehicle. The visuals of the Southern California lanscape are breathtaking and make me want to travel there. The scenes where Wilson head-butts the security guard and where he shoots up the warehouse are brilliant and hilarious because they are so understated. This film is stylistically smart and also contains a message at the end about revenge and grief that is very touching."
2,WHAT'S THE HIPE ABOUT?,"I watched the movie. It was OK, not the worst I have seen but really nothing to get excited about. There are other movies like ""Taken"" which is far better. If you haven't seen it, you are not missing something."
2,A Miss,"Soderbergh's movies are usually hit or miss for me. I love Out of Sight, Ocean's 11 and of course, Traffic. However, Solaris and now, The Limey are misses for me. There are definite great parts about The Limey, such as Terence Stamp and even Fonda, but I just never really go into the story. I was convinced Stamp's character wanted revenge, but the scenes that were supposed to convince me of his love for his daughter fell flat.Soderbergh's signature style is definitely there though. As an early work of his, you can really see what he turned that style into later in his better works. The Limey is probably the first movie I didn't care for that I actually bought the soundtrack to, so there's something!"
2,Turning pulp into art,"Almost all non-linear approaches of filmmaking have always been quite overated and some even deserved a cult following. Steven Soderbergh's ""The Limey"" is one of those unfortunate cases when a director is so eager of turning pulp into art that he becomes completely lost in his own pedantry, but the film has its moments and it's eloquent in its violence. With Terence Stamp as an ex-convict who just watched ""Get Carter"", Peter Fonda and Lesley Ann Warren."
2,I am in the minority here....,"but I just didn't like this movie. I am a fan of Soderburgh..Traffic was a great movie, Erin Brokovich, Out of Sight, etc...but this movie just didn't do a whole lot for me. Honestly the best thing about this movie was the always wonderful Terrence Stamp. Peter Fonda was a joke, and the very underrated Luis Guzman wasn't given enough to do.I wanted to like this film, but I couldn't. My husband rented this from Netflix after reading an article stating this was one of the top ten movies for guys...my husband is a man's man...and he didn't like this movie either.Nope, I think it tried to be too much, it wanted to be an action movie, why through in the convoluted storytelling. It wanted to be a film noir, why through in the cheesy actions sequences. Lots of fine actors, but this film is overrated..period.Watch Momento for a better story, better directing, and better acting."
2,Some films should never be given brains.,"This film plowed on with the same boorish tenacity as its main character. Basically it is a pseudo action movie that the director, in Dr. Frankenstein fashion, attempted to infuse with a brain. It would have been better without. I can sum the whole plot up in a few words: cockney career criminal attempts to make good on bad parentage by killing all the bad guys in his dead daughter's past. The flashbacks are artsy and overdone, and the story is mindless. Definitely wait for the fire sale on this one, you will never watch it more than once, if even that."
5,nice dream,"This movie took me by complete surprise. I didn't know what to think of it. Some of my friends said it was kind of a mystery, the box says thriller, and I ended up believing it was a dream. Why a Dream? Because everything was out of order, time passes without you really paying attention and when its over, you're not sure if it was real or not. Not real in the fact that its a movie and its fiction, but real in the sense that it was so GOOD. The performances are amazing, the sense of loss, sense of hopelessness, sense of accomplishment, these things are all portrayed in the film excellently. I was taken paticularly by the Terrence Stamp flashbacks of him in his earlier years. The last scene is a beautiful ending, if somewhat tragic, or hopeful. I can't decide. You can decide for yourself whether this ""dream"" by the quirky mind of Steven Soderbergh is beautiful, or tragic."
2,"Disappointing, Disjointed and Confused","I was really disappointed with this movie. Terence Stamp seemedunable to maintain a cockney accent at the same time as putting anyexpression into his voice at all, Peter Fonda was effectively in cameo mode and the constant flashbacks, flash forwards and fantasy scenes were indecipherable from each other. Confused - you will be. The references to cockney rhyming slang were over played and simply unrealistic. When you start picking things like this up in a movie you know that it just isn't working. On the plus side some of the supporting cast turned in good performances and the key to events - revealed at the end - was sound. This however was not enough to save the film, just because a product is bad does not mean you can pretend it is artistic."
4,A Very Cool Disc,"Steven Soderbergh and Lem Dobbs have created a very cool movie. While the film jumps around in time and space, the film is never confusing. My one complaint is the commentary tracks on the DVD. The first (by Soderbergh and Dobbs) is styled just like the movie. While this was cool at first, it got old after while. I guess that I am old fashioned when it comes to my DVD commentary tracks, I just want a plain old track that tells me about the making of the movie. My other complaint is on the second commentary track Peter Fonda starts a story that never gets finished (the one about the email from Terence Stamp).However, these complaints are minor compaired to how much I liked the movie. Terence Stamp is the epitome of cool, while Peter Fonda is a very creepy villian. I give this film my highest recomendation."
3,Beautifully shot and directed but disappointing overall,"I was really looking forward to seeing this film. I love film noir, I loved the idea of this film when I heard about it, and I think Steve Soderbergh is a great director. I have to admit, though, that I never really got into this film. It looks great, the premise is intriguing, and Terrence Stamp makes a great leading man, but I can't really recommend the film overall. It's worth seeing for the innovative camera work, editing, and cinematography but that's about it in my opinion."
3,Worth watching,"This movie is an interesting character study. (warning: possible spoilers) The main character is in search of his daughter's killer. In the end, he discovers the truth about himself and how he has affected his daughter with whom he has hardly spent any time. Watching the main character, I found myself asking ""who is this guy?"" He kills people, but shows restraint and disernment. He also manages to keep from being caught. The surround sound was powerful in its minimalism. It was not overused, so when the subwoofer kicks in at particularly violent moments, you can really feel it. There are some good music tracks that surround nicely. The movie, in the end, has that rainy-day ""so this is how it is"" feel to it. Like I said, it is worth watching at least once. Not worth buying, in my opinion"
5,A BLOODY GOOD FILM!,"Ah,this film is....COOL! A def homage to NOIR & 70's movies such as POINT BLANK & THE GET AWAY.Terrance Stamp & Peter Fonda are perfect & Luis Guzman(one of the best character actors today)is on the money as well.Great direction,good story telling & fantastic acting make this one of the years best! Nice touch using old mvie clips from STAMPS earlier film for flashbacks!This movie although not a ""action"" film keeps it going w/out explosions & rap music(oh the old days)!Def a keeper,do yourself a favor & buy this film for your collection. BTW, ""TELL HIM IM COMING""!"
1,A bit of old tat,"Cheap stereotyped revenge fantasy. How many times do we have to see this kind of nonsense? Terry Stamp hams it up for Hollywood, right, Terry old son? Peter Fonda falls into the same bracket. Forty years ago they charmed us with their youthful looks; it went to their heads and they ceased acting. Don't bother with this tosh, okay mate?"
2,I was disappointed,"The Limey is about a man who travels to southern California to investigate the murder of his daughter. I just didn't see why the critics loved this movie. To me, it seemed like everyone involved was trying too hard to make it another Pulp Fiction. An uninteresting story line that didn't always make sense didn't help this any either."
1,Limey,"I watched this movie with my wife. She got up to take a shower 45min. into it. I think I should have joined her because this movie is not worth watching. The acting was bad, It proves anyone can read a line and stand around trying to look like they are in deep thought. The Dialog is boaring and trying at times. I would expect more from a high school film student. Half the film is rehashing flashbacks and flashforwards. The charicters are boaring and lifeless. The only interesting person in the movie is the 2-bit poolhall killer, and he wasn't that interesting. In the end I'd like to say I had very little feeling for any of the people or what they were doing. Fonda and Stamp couldn't carry this film because they both can't act. I'd give this a -5 stars but Amazon has no - (minus) rating."
1,Most boring film of the year,"I had this movie on my recomendation list, so i walked to the rent shop to hire it. A complete waste of time and money. The story doesn't take you in, the dialogs are so boring, not any fun at all, the acting is so piontless you don't know what to do with the characters, and soderberg just drowns any moments of the story, where it could get interesting or thrilling in slow thoughtfull camera positions. if i would have seen this in the cinema, i would have fallen asleep or left before ending. Better forget about this movie and watch taxi driver instead."
4,"Not much of a thriller, more of a psychological trip","Well presented non linear film. There are flashbacks and foreshadows cleverily placed. Terrance Stamp gives a take no prisoners performance. Not so much a thriller, but it does have its moments. There is not much action, but it holds strong. An entertaining experience."
4,Not what I expected,"I had passed over this movie several times in the video store, but someone told me that it wasn't what I thought it was....So, I tried it. They were right. It wasn't what I thought. A real treat in an era of predictable demographically-targeted entertainment!The non-linear story telling and slightly offset editing created an unsettling (but not uncomfortable) atmosphere. You aren't always sure that what you think you understand is true. That seemed a really appropriate way to tell this story. On it's face, it seems to be a simple case of a father's quest to avenge his daughters death...but is it so simple?Very memorable and worthy performances by all the well-casted characters ensure that you are drawn in for the ride."
5,More to this than it seems,"The father's revenge forumula is played out at the highest standard, with the most committed performances, the finest screenwriting, and the most evocative photography. High point: Peter Fonda's evocation of the 60s."
4,one of soderbergh's better minor films,"I saw The Limey when it was first released, and I still like its style. But I revisited it a decade later on DVD for the infamous commentary track, which features the politely ruffled screenwriter duking it out with the director. They never revert to yelling, but there is clearly some intense feeling as the duo discuss their dislike and/or reasoning of the many choices made during the writing,shooting, and editing of the film."
4,More than an action flick,"Although it has a fairly standard plot, ex-con seeks revenge for daughter's death, this film has several non-standard elements that save it from the 'B' action genre. There are frequent, short flash backs and flash forwards including alternate events that give a dream-like quality without turning it into 'Mulholland Drive'. There's surprising little violence, I counted less than a dozen bodies, and almost all occur off-screen. Also the protagonist anti-hero, played wonderfully by Terence Stamp, appears to be a more complicated than usual character although this isn't explored as much as it could have been. The ambiguous ending comes directly that complication. Although it has a completely different plot and is not as deep, this film reminds me a lot of 'Falling Down'."
3,gimmickry spoilt the movie,"Soderbergh has the tendency of playing around with the concept of time in his movies (Out of sight is another movie that comes to mind.) The Limey has its moments, but the intercuts of scenes become grating by the third use. At times, it appears that Soderbergh was in competition with his actors to see if they could one-up his camera. The actors did well, but the movie suffers as the result. It is as if Soderbergh wanted to make light of the irony of the ending, and chose to distract the viewers instead. If you like art movie, check it out (some of the intercuts actually remind me of some old movies by Jean-Luc Godard.) If you prefer profound movies, there are better movies out there."
1,TurboBAD,"This product is marketed as being able to import DFX and DWG files and it can't. The manual states that you can manipulate layers in the import preference setup and the program shows no such capability. In fact, it can't handle layers at all. Version 1.0 is at best beta software. Customer support is a joke. They charge $1.00 per minute for support calls and $10.00 per email. Spend your money on this program and you're on your own. False claims+no support=JUNK. Don't waste your money on this garbage. If I could give it no star, I would."
1,I'd give this zero stars if it was an option.,"I was looking for a simple drafting program to do floorplans and basic blueprints. The sales blurb implies this is exactly what I needed. However, the instruction booklet is useless, I emailed them several times asking if tutorials or templates were available and I got no response. I would have been happy to pay for them. There is an affiliated site offering instruction and tutorials, they never responded to my enquiries either. I'm sure if you are familiar with autocad this is a good alternative to more expensive programs, but I could not be sure.I see no point in selling a product and offering zero customer service. I would return it but now it is installed I see no point in battling with amazon or turbocad, I will probably lose and end up winding myself up even more.My advice - get virtual pc and pick from numerous architectural and drafting programs available at a fraction of the cost."
2,Too confusing,"I used to use a much earlier version of turbocad for Mac OS 7. That program was wonderful. When this was introduced I naturally assumed it would be a much better update and just as easy to use. I was wrong. The program is difficult to use, or rather get started with. and there doesn't seem to be a way to easily set the grid or the final output size as there was in the previous versions.Overall, I'm very disappointed in this product. The Manual wasn't much help either."
4,Excellent music with poor staging,"This is a very good (although very long) opera. The singing and conducting are excellent. Unfortunately, the staging, which consists of a number of panels showing various Swiss type scenes with what looks like choir stalls in front of the panels, simply doesn't work. At best, it adds nothing; at worst it is a distraction. I would rate the singing 5 stars and the staging 2 stars. Since this long opera is less expensive on DVDs than on CDs, it is still a good buy in spite of it's shortcomings, even if you decide to close your eyes while you listen to it."
4,Would it be 5 stars if ....,"When it comes to ""Gugliemo Tell,"" you can't beat this version. But one thing, it's unfortunate that it lacks Japanese subtitle. This letdown derogates from 5 stars. Four titles from Opus Arte, The Ring of the Nibelung, which feature an Oscar winning Eiko Ishioka as costume designer, carry Japanese title. So this version is the best of best."
3,Opera or Oratorio?,"A quality production musically, but at times it seemed like a concert version or an oratorio. I'd have prefered an attempt at acting. I didn't care for the set design; the travelogue got tired after awhile."
4,A hilarious melding,"OK, ""high concept review"": What if you took the old E.C. horror comics, and mixed it up with old E.C. MAD comics -- tossing a few old E.C. ""Two-Fisted Tales"" in with the mix? Well, that's THE GOON -- both in its sensibilities, its subject matter, and its lush style of artwork.I picked this up after many recommendations from many people (both friends and critics). And while it took me a few pages to get into it -- and to realize that what was going to draw me in was the humor. Any comic that can get me to laugh convulsively more than 10 times throughout its length has my vote, and my filthy lucre.If you like your horror straight up, I doubt this will do it for you; but if your looking for comedy tinged with gore -- you're in for a treat."
5,Great stuff...,"I didn't know exactly what to expect of this specific book, as it was a first volume of a long-running series. I have to say this was one of those incredibly pleasant surprises! The dark humor is spot on, as is the nihilism and total lack of any moral or decency (at least apparently...) that we've come to love and cherish on any good zombie film/book/comic.The main character is a brute and he should be, the zombies are irrelevant and totally discardable, as they should be. Spot on."
1,Pathetic,"Would have been great if this item was the item I had received...But I did not get the item in this picture. Instead what I got was old, bent and broken...pathetic.."
1,Dry and boring,"This book is so dry and dense...the material is not difficult, but the book is poorly organized and written in such a boring manner that you really do not want to take the time to read it (even if it's for a class). I have other books on health care organization that are MUCH more user-friendly and actually interesting to read. Don't buy this book unless you really have to."
1,I hate this book!!,"I absolutely without a doubt hate this book. It is a required book for a course that I am taking. It uses way to many initials instead of writing the complete name of each organization, so unless you have one heck of a memory you arn't sure which organization that those initials stand for. It is a very hard book to sit down and read because it is way to boring, the authors go on and on about about the topics instead of presenting the topics in a clear straight forward way. The questions at the end of each chapter are mostly based on your opinion, so you are never quite sure if your answer is correct or not. I can't wait till this class is over so that I never have to read this book again!!!"

1,poor execution in kindle.,"the arabic text is handled as a picture; as such its size is not adjustable and is quite small. the real problem is that the text of the stories is so light as to be mostly illegible. this is cleverly hidden in the downloadable sample by the fact that only the introduction is included. in its current format, a ten dollar scam."
1,Not for Kindle,"I agree, this does not work in Kindle and should not be presented as a Kindle book. Kindle needs to address the lack of support for Arabic fonts."
1,Be careful -,"I took the advice of this book and stayed in a Bed andBreakfast named (...), Oxfordshire, England. The owner,(...) was rude to us and her husband threatened us because we stayed in our room until Noon a few days. They informed us that a Bed and Breakfast was NOT a hotel - that we only paid for a ""Bed to sleep in and Breakfast"" then we had to get out for the day...even when we had paid for a week in advance. I was appalled at the rudeness and threatening attitude of this couple! Be careful of taking this book's advice on where to stay in England!"
4,Good value for apartment dwellers,"It seems like every apartment I move into the first thing I have to do is change the shower head. I go to the Danco brand every time. It's a great economy brand that doesn't cost too much and works really well for the price. B/c, let's face it, it's easier to just replace it myself than wait for maintenance to get around to it. And I'm not going to invest major bucks in a rental.So if you live in an apartment with a crappy shower, this is a great investment. A really cheap five minute fix. You won't be sorry."
1,elementary information,i found this book to be extremely elementary as far as it's content. there was nothing in this book that you couldn't find on the various military web sites. i thought that the material was to general and i found most of was not helpful. i recommend that you find another source for information on this topic.
1,Horrible book. Time better spent on the net,My biggest problem with this book is that it lacks an index so its mediocre format is especially painful. Having been qualified as a calvary scout (19D)and lately interested in Psych Ops (37F) I found information on both MOSs lacking.A good portion of the book is dated including the many useless forms. Any forms you'll need your recruiter will have online.A good example of the complacent editing this book has undergone:Under U.S. Army - Popular movies listed include Private Benjamin and G.I. Jane (Navy Seal Drama).I recommend instead researching on the internet and finding service specific literature: For instance the books by Robert S. Rush for those interesting in the US Army. Also the downloaded game from the U.S. Army website is also a great resource.
3,Dated,"Barron's normally puts out a decent guide to about anything they approach; however, this book is currently over 7 years old, and is not organized as well as one should expect from Barron's. I woul d recommend you skip on this book and go online to research opportunbities at each branch's website. Don't forget that the Coast Guard, Merchant Marines, and National Oceanographic and Atmospeheric Agency are also uniformed services.If you are interested in becoming a military officer, you may want to check out ""How to Become a Commissioned Officer in the U.S. Military,"" by Ron Taylor."
5,love this shirt,bought as a gift for my father and he absolutely loves this tshirt. it came in xxl size and washes and dries very nicely.
3,not the colour,"the colour i received is not blue as shown but yellow.Couldnt change it because it was a birthday present for my daughter and havent got time.She really didn,t like it"
5,"""the finishing touch""","This book is a must for anyone considering becoming an image consultant. It is very apparent that the authors have practiced what they are teaching. Every aspect of the image consulting business is covered including resources for necessary training which many authors omit. I have read many books on this subject and this one by far is the most complete. The contents can also transform a ""good"" image consultant into an ""outstanding"" image consultant. In summary, this book meets the needs of anyone remotely interested in this business and the ""finishing touch"" for those who have chosen image consulting as a career. Thanks Lynne and Dominique for sharing your life experiences."
4,Good Music,"Good Music, with fine harmonies although some songs did not suit my taste. Over all I am well pleased with the purchase."
5,Great in line switch,I bought this switch as it was just what I was looking for. It was very easy to install and works as I had hoped. It is well made and seems durable.
4,Cord Switch Toggle Design,"This toggle cord switch is quite simple to install on electrical cord for table/desk lamp that no need for a direct switch or pull chain at the bulb socket. Far more practical design than the wheel-type switch which the holding rivet can become loose soon and the housing separates and expose the wiring connection---dangerous! The wheel-type is also harder on the thumb, because of its gear-like edge, for on-off operation,and most ladies do not like it."
4,Flawed by a Bad Floor Plan,"This is, of course, the seminal book on everybody's favorite fatty. Even 35 years ago, however, when scholarly studies of Nero Wolfe were in their infancy, I was stuck by how badly proportioned the page-192 first-floor plan of the brownstone house was. It had all the correct rooms, true, but the scale was clearly grotesque -- for instance, the dining room was apparently 3 times the size of the office. Compare it to the infinitely more exact (and realistic) plan on page 100 of Ken Darby's book ""The Brownstone House of Nero Wolfe."" Perhaps Baring-Gould merely had a bad draftsman; if not, he clearly had no understanding of the elements of architecture -- or of what was fairly clearly spelled out by Stout in the Canon...."
4,A delicious bite of the Big Apple!,"Anyone who has used the New York subway system knows that one of the delightful day-to-day pleasures is the presence of the subway musician. Sometimes it's a full band, other times it's just an old fella singing the blues. But it adds a bit of harmony to an otherwise hectic day. A number of these musicians recorded studio tracks for this album, and it's a perfect example of the variety of fine music they have to offer. Everything from Latin jazz to Chinese classical is represented here. It's a delicious bite of the Big Apple, and wholeheartedly recommended! The only down side to this album, and it's a minor point, is that there's far too much obviously-faked subway ""banter"" between the tracks. All the ""N-train is now departing"" stuff was cool once or twice, but it's not needed between every track. It cuts down on the space devoted to the real music, which as a result only takes up 10 or 11 full tracks."
1,Interferes with wireless network,"Watch out. The mouse seemed to work fine. However, all of a sudden the pointer motion became sporatic and jumpy. Turns out any time my wireless G network got heavy traffic (a different computer running a backup to the server) the mouse got interference. I tried it several times and confirmed 100% this to be the case. Back it goes."
5,The perfect mouse,This Logitech G7 Laser Cordless Mouse is everything and more than I had hoped for in a mouse. It is perfect in every way and tracks like a cat. The fact that you get two rechargable batteries is a blessing. You get warned on your PC screen that battery power is low. A few seconds later you have swapped the battery with one from your recarger unit and continue on your way. It's worth every penny and more.
3,poor battery,The mouse is great... The batteries are very bad... they only last a day or two and do not hold a charge... It is very difficult to replace these batteries -- it seems no one sells them separetely - you have to buy a whole new complete mouse package.
3,Why less buttons than my mx510?!,"I would have strongly considered buying this, but for some reason Logitech thought having less buttons than my MX510 would make this a better mouse. When playing games like WoW or surfing the net via Firefox having those extra buttons are a great convenience.The perfect mouse would be to integrate the new features of the G7 (wireless, left/right scrolling) into the MX510/MX518 layout.Try again Logitech."
