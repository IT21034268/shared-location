4,"The ""Nashville"" of Black Flicks?","Funny, funky, greatish multi-character piece appears to include every major black comic star from my youth aside from Redd Foxx and Jimmie ""J.J."" Walker. It does what other movies attempt to do in half the time--weave together the lives of many fascinating characters. The DVD is full frame and sans extras, but I love the movie and plan to revisit it often.PS-Whatever happened to Franklyn Ajaye?"
2,Car Wash,"Couldn't remember what the plot was, and so I spent some money to buy Car Wash. ooOH what a mutt of a movie. The acting was lame the soundtrack s-cked. It might have been good in the day, but it didn't survive the test of time. Save your money, it doesn't pay to buy this piece of ---."
2,Car Wash...workin' at the car wash...,"My nephew worked a part time job at a car wash down yonder in the Sunshine state of Florida. I sent the Dvd to him as a gag gift. By the time it arrived at his home he had already moved on up to a job with a dry cleaners, standing on the corner while wearing a clown suit and waiving at the passing cars. The pay sucks, but he gets to take the clown suit home. Nice, eh?His father told me he's trying to land still another job. He wasn't clear about the details--something about a shovel and elephants."
5,Editor eview needs a TOILET FLUSHING OF A REVISION,"THIS MOVIE IS A CLASSIC, 10 STAR MOVIE WITH ALL THE GREAT COMEDIANS OF THEIR TIME AND EVEN TO LATTER GENERATIONS. THE EDITOR FOR THIS MOVIE CRITIQUE SAID THAT ""THIS MOVIE IS NOT ORIGINAL??"" HELLOOOO THIS WAS MADE IN THE '70S! OF COURSE THIS MOVIE AND IT'S MATERIAL IS ORIGINAL, KIND OF A NOO BRAINER AND WHOMEVER GAVE THAT CRITIC HER JOB SHOULD CTIQUE THEMSELVES ON WHY IN THEE WORLD THEY GAVE HER THE POSITION.SOMEONE SHOULD TELL THAT CRITIC, PAULA SELF-CHECK OR WHATEVER, THAT SHE HAS NO IDEA AS TO WHAT SHE IS TALKING ABOUT AND IF PEOPLE ALL OVER BELIEVE CRITICS LIKE HER, THAT SUCH TIMELESS MASTERPIECES SUCH AS THIS MOVIE ""IS NO GOOD,"" EXCELLENT OR EVEN A DECENT MOVIE FOR THAT MATTER, NO MOVIE WORTH WATCHING WOULD GET ANY ATTENTION SO JUDGING FOR YOURSELF WOULD BE ""THEE"" BEST OPTION."
3,It's only full screen!,As noted...yep... once again these classics butchered... it's cut and only full screen... despite that it says 1.85:1 on Amazon... even the back of the box say 1.33:1 Full Screen.
5,Dadddy Rich,"The music made the movie!!!I bought this cd for the track ""You Got To Believe"" by the Pointer Sisters because my family and I re-enacted the scene Daddy Rich speech at the carwash for our family reunion which was a 70's theme.To my surprise the actual dialogue from the movie was on the cd!Oh those 70's memories!!!!!!"
3,Before the Cuts,"I saw the original movie when it came out. In fact, they filmed most scenes at my neighborhood car wash where I got my car washed at weekly. I just wish I had of at least purchased the VHS back then, before they decided to cut some of the best scenes out, and then distribute the DVD's. Does anyone have or know where I can get an original copy of Car Wash before these scenes were deleted.....???Brooke Adams ... Terry (scenes deleted)Benny Baker ... Barney (scenes deleted)Danny DeVito ... Joe (scenes deleted)Lewis Lillian ... Bernie (scenes deleted)Danny Tucker ... Cop at Big Joe's (scenes deleted)Sunny Woods ... Kenny's Date (scenes deleted)"
5,Do you remember the 1970's? Travel back in time for fun!,"I enjoyed watching Richard Pryor and George Carlin, before they became famous, in this classic comedy with a sound track ""Carwash"" that is timeless in itself! The story is about a crew of employees and their daily life at the Car Wash. The lives of employees are made interesting with the customers who come to the Car Wash with their own unique problems, as well the as pranks employees pull on one another to liven up their days."
3,Its A Classic..... Sort Of!!!,"Its.... Unique... Not a waste of time..... Clever... Reminds me of LA..... & a trip back to the 70's. Its a great film when you don't want to think... and you want to be entertained & think ... Did we ever dress like that...???? No, Pryor doesn't stick out... but who cares.... the film has a component of nuts n bolts to hold the whole thing together.... & for the most part - everyone is semi-happy..... in a Car Wash....(makes you think for a minute)....."
2,Where's the Dolby?,"I give this movie a 2 because although I don't own it, I've seen it a few times and am glad to see it out on DVD. However, with no Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack or even stereo, it doesn't seem worth buying the DVD version. Is the VHS version also in mono?"
2,Good performers doing poorly.,"I purchased this primarily because of George Carlin's, Richard Pryor's and Irwin Corey's names. I was very disappointed. I did not laugh. It's as simple as that. Not funny. But I would have always wondered, had I not seen it."
1,Several scenes deleted or cut short,"Several scenes were either left out or chopped in this version. The bickering couple running the hamburger stand next to the lot was cut out.The end of the scenes of the son of the owner saying good bye to the employees and the receptionist finding out the customer she thought she had a date with was actually setting her up with a buddy, were chopped off. Those scenes may not have been critical to the story line but were humorously well done and I miss them."
1,Give me the ORIGINAL!,"I HATE this cut up version!! I miss the Danny Devito scene, as well as the ending (the blind date sequence). Where can I purchase the Original Car wash, the one I saw in the theater? Can someone out there tell me."
3,Where's the love?,"Written by Joel Schumacher (who went on to make Lost Boys, Falling Down and many more), this cult classic is the meandering story of a lazy day at the local '70s car wash. Cameos from Richard Pryor and George Carlin spice it up a little, but it's mostly the music, the clothes and those 'fros that make this a film you shouldn't miss. Unfortunately the DVD has no special features at all and is not even in widescreen. Maybe we should wait for someone to show the film a little respect."
1,old model,"This is the same camera as the TRENDnet TV-IP400W, except that this one (the SMC version) is frozen in time at around 2006. The firmware version is 1.00 and there are no updates from SMC. The IPView Pro camera software version is 3 and there are no updates from SMC. The TRENDnet version has firmware updates as recent as Sept. 2008, and the IPView Pro camera software is on version 4. This SMC camera will work with the TRENDnet version of IPView Pro, but it won't take the TRENDnet firmware update. If you're looking for wireless, be aware that this one (and the TV-IP400W) don't do WPA2, if you want that, look at the TV-IP410W or TV-IP422W. Picture quality is ok though grainy; the more expensive Axis cameras have much better images. Software is not good (flaky, slow); I was hoping that a firmware update or software update would help. If you really want this older camera, go with the TRENDnet version not this SMC."
4,Superbly Fresh and Unique American Music,"Women have long held important roles in rural American songwriting and music-making. This group of young women are worthy successors. Far too original and ambitious to be simply keepers of the flame, Uncle Earl makes old-time music that's undeniably contemporary. Their topical songs weave stories grounded in today's realities. And their expansive repertoire of old-time cover tunes inspires the classics with the living essence of our time. Frankly, I bought this one on a lark ... hoping for the best. And I got the very best indeed."
5,Great discovery,"Once this band was discovered (by me, i.e.) I listen to it all the time.This one stays in my car for traveling music. Great stuff!"
4,this book got me started on databases...,"Years ago, I've picked this book up to learn Access... I haven't used Access for quite a while now (mostly an Oracle person now), but I still have fond memories of this book. Not only does this book teach you Access, and it does that very well, it also go through the database fundamentals. An overall great book, imho."
3,Good info at a cost to your time,"This book has a general lack of illustration throughout. I found that the way information is presented can be difficult to follow and cumbersome at times. I am a technical professional by trade and still found some of the information to be poorly presented. However, it is there. Meaning that the information can be found if you're willing to work a little harder than you should have to to find it."
4,DAO & quantum physics,"I find some of the complaints about this books to be interesting. First of all, I have always liked this book (refering to 2nd edition) for its concise simplicity (I wonder if the person who compares it to quantum physics has actually ever studied quantum physics?). And secondly I suspect that those who complained about dao do not realize that to use DAO one must first establish a reference to it in the vba window (Tools, References, check ""Microsoft DAO x.xx Object Library). The program does not automatically provide reference to both dao and ado because of the overlap of objects in their respective libraries. Anyway, it is an excellent book."
2,DAO Disasters,"Like the other hapless guy, I could not get the DAO to run under Access 2002. The cover says ""access 2002"" and yet there is no explanation of which references to assign so that the DAO code put forth in the book will run. After setting the references that Microsoft suggests, some of the code ran and some did not. Stevey-baby could've put a few paragraphs in the 3rd edition to save his more idiotic readers (I am their champion!) a few hours of tragic longing for the bygone days of DAO. Oh!"
1,MS Access or Quantum Physics?,"The author's highly technical, uninspiring writing style makes even the most straight forward MS Access concept seem like an advanced problem in quantum physics. This book actually succeeds in making it harder to understand MS Access. The sign of a good technical author is that they make complex topics clear and intuitive to understand. This book does exactly the opposite."
1,Not Enough Real World Examples,"I purchased this book today at Barnes & Noble and I must say that I am disappointed. The book was not very intuitive. Most of the examples in the book reference mathmatical expresssions rather than real world examples. This may be helpful for the math wizard crossing over to programming, but it does not help somebody who needs practical advice on database design.As comic book guy from the Simpson's would say....""Worst database book ever!"""
2,"Needlessly complicated, should be titled Access for nerds",They've got to be kidding by glossing over relevant points such as Cartesian products and making the rest of the book needlessly complicated. The author has made real world examples completely cryptic. If you wish to be scared away from working in Access - this is your book!
2,disappointing,"True to its title, this book has an excellent section on database design, particularly as it pertains to Microsoft Access. However, I found it particularly frustrating when none of the code examples in the book worked with my databases. When I read Balter's ""Mastering Microsoft Access 2000 Develoment"", also available at Amazon, I found out why. DAO has been replaced by ADO. This book covers DAO first, and mentions only later. I spent five days trying to get DAO to work and failed. I am so glad I had my other Access book to steer me straight.The great introduction to relational databases is useful, but you could glean the same information from Hernandez's ""Database Design for Mere Mortals"" and it would apply to all DBMSes.I hate to give an O'Reilly book a bad review, but this one didn't meet my expectations. It is advertised to apply to Access versions 97-2002, but I don't think it is as up-to-date as some of the other books on the market."
3,One of my favorites now on CD,"The Soldier in the Rain theme is excellent. very sad, but just excellent. i like both Mancini and Severinsen and this is great of the two"
5,Buy this CD!!!! It's great!,"I have owned this music for over 37 years, first on vinyl and then on CD and I never get tired of listening to it. Listen for yourself to the samples on Amazon. I think you will be pleasantly surprised."
3,"Great Mucisianship, Flugelhorn Intonation is Substandard","Two of the entertainment industry's best known music talents team up for an excellent elevator music experience. Unfortunately, the intonation of Doc's flugelhorn really lacks luster in my opinion.I don't know if it was just the way flugelhorns sounded back in the 70's, but the one Doc used to record this alblum has a whacky, tinny tone quality. Frankly, it's a tad uncomfortable to listen to. There is enjoyment value in listening to these two consumate professionals make beautiful music, but I can't help wonder what Doc was thinking when he approved the release of this recording with such noff-color sounding flugelhorn. Sounds like a Frumpet or something.Unless your are a die hard Doc or Mancini fan, you won't be missing out on anything special if you miss this particular CD.Sorry Doc, I'm a huge fan, but I got to call em as I hear em."
4,A must have for EC fans,"I bought this for my brother who loves the old EC comics. He couldn't put it down. He loved all the pictures, and information."
1,Spend a little more and get a better magnet,This thing is not worth $50. The posts for the wheels were too short for the nylock nuts to engage the threads. The threaded post that attaches the handle to the base broke loose right away since it was only press fit and not welded. I managed to fix the wheels by grinding down the wheel hub. Luckily my neighbor has a welder so the handle is fixed. Save yourself a lot of trouble and invest a lttle more to get better magnet.
2,not like the old days,"In the old days we went to school, paid attention, did required reading and studied. Now we have these learning ""alternatives""...... anyway, amazon had the best price,,, and it arrived right away."
4,"Great book, but...","Great resource for my high school freshman. Like some other reviews here, I found out that the answer key is missing from the back of the Advanced Level book. Very disappointing."
3,Six-Way Paragraphs Advanced,This would be a great resource for the struggling reader or writer if the answer key wasn't missing from the book. Some of the books seem to have been published with answer key pages missing. Book contains over 100 paragraphs to analyze and graphs to chart student progress.
2,My review of - I Told You So The Ultimate Hits Of Randy Travis,"Given Randy's extensive career and success, I would have expected a more comprehensive selection of hits and not just sixteen songs. Thirty songs plus would not have gone a stray. Similarly, a bonus disc with extras about Randy's life and or the making of the DVD etc would have been welcomed as well.Like many fans of Randy Travis the DVD fell short in terms of providing a truly ""Ultimate Hits"" and comprehensive DVD experience. For me it was the lack of quantity and bonus DVD extras preventing a three or four star rating being given.However, on the other side of the ledger, the picture and sound quality was excellent.In short, the ""I Told You So The Ultimate Hits Of Randy Travis"" should have been better.DC"
2,What the ???,"I had no idea that this book was sooooo small, I mean seriously! It kind of made me laugh when I opened the box, it's just sooo tiny, very hard to read. I love the 'Peanuts' and collect a lot of snoopy stuff, but this was very disappointing! Not the story, but the size."
1,look for another easter book,"This book is tiny at about 2 inches by 2 inches. The story is longer than I like to I like to read for a bedtime story and the words are so small that they are hard to see! I love Peanuts stories, but this book was a huge disappointment!"
1,Facts cannot be relied upon,"The first three chapters were interesting. But the next two on Jesus were a surprise. He stated that the militant Jesus and his band of terrorists attacked a synagogue. Then in the final passover, they attacked Jerusalem but were captured and killed.Since these ""facts"" were clearly fabricated to support the conclusion he later wanted to support about how drugs can help one see their inner self, it appears we cannot rely on any other of his ""facts"" because they may be just as fabricated and self-serving.The book appears to be nothing other than fantasy fiction, not a book on cultures. So it was a complete waste of time reading."
4,"An Excellent Anthropological Study of ""Weird"" Cultural Practices","I found some amusing and interesting stories in Cows, Pigs, Wars and Witches - Marvin Harris' irreverent and objective guide to phenomena he describes as 'cow love', 'pig hate' and 'phantom cargo'. Harris writes in an easy laid back style with plenty of anecdotes, and though the work tries to explain a lot of deeply ingrained cultural practices as well as taboos, it is never simplistic. The general pace of the book however did not quite prepare me for the strongly worded final chapters however, where the author takes a shot at the hippie movement of the late sixties and early seventies. The book was published in the mid-seventies so it does tend to be a little dated but I think it is an excellent work and a rewarding read."
5,"Thought provoking, witty, and intersting.","If you are a Jew, Christian, or Pagan you will learn something about your religion that no one else has told you. That in itself makes this a book worth owning."
3,A survey of culture,"Marvin Harris gives a survey of the various religious practices in the world. The first chapter deals with what people eat and why. Why do westerners eat beef but, is taboo in India. He also discusses witchcraft and why many people (especially women) were put to death for witchcraft. He also discusses why males are dominate in many cultures and the reasons for warfare. Marvin Harris looks at these differnt cultural traits and compares them to our culture."
5,champion Everyday Bra,I have just purchased several of the Champion Everyday bras. I must say that it is the most comfortable bra I have every owned. It is the FIRST bra I have owned that does not fall off at the shoulders. I tend to have rounded shoulders and this is a real problem for me. I highly recommend it.
5,Excellent CD,"I bought the cd/dvd edition of The Second Decade and I really enjoyed it. There is a great selection of songs on the cd, but I wish he had included his rendition of the Rich Mullins song ""Awesome God,"" which is one of my favorite Michael songs. The dvd was quite entertaining. There is even a little clip of Michael dancing! I would definitely recommend the cd/dvd edition of The Second Decade to any Smitty fan! In response to dantheman26, I did not have any problems playing the dvd in my dvd player."
5,A Must-Buy for MWS Fans,"If you love even one of MWS's songs, you will love this CD. It is a collection of most of the best songs that he has recorded in the last 10 years. It is so essential to any MWS fan because it is the ones that, to me, have been so significant in my life. There are also 3 new songs, one of which was written by his son Ryan, ""Signs."" There is also a new version of ""Friends"" featuring many of the leading Christian artists at the moment, which is amazing. The songs on this CD are as timeless as Michael W. Smith.Also, you can get the limited edition DVD, which, after 3 tries, finally got to work on my computer. It features 4 music videos, with commentary, as well as a retrospective of the last 10 years by MWS. I loved it--I watched it before I listened to the CD. I recommend this CD to anyone willing to listen."
4,Heartwarming...,"Once she was a top reporter, now Colleen Collins (Collie) is reduced to taking a friend's charity and accepting a fluff piece about Texas cooking for a magazine. She can not cook, is not from Texas, and hates small towns. Yet, she has little choice, so heads off to the Texas hill country. However, it is not as bad as it was expected to be, despite car troubles and infuriating sexy cowboys. Before long, Collie finds herself learning a few basics, like how to cook and cope, and a few other truths of life. The little town might be full of quirks, but she finds a beautiful wisdom that makes her feel alive and at home. Then, Collie gets a once in a lifetime chance to regain all she has lost. Her heart says one thing, her head another.**** This heartwarming book perfectly captures rural Texas. It really is much like Mayberry as the author depicts. Texas Cooking is filled with warmth and wisdom and laughs. ****Reviewed by Amanda Killgore"
3,"Pretty Good Reading, (although a little maudlin at the end)","This book was a good read for me, but I have two critisisms of it. 1)It portrays people who live in small towns as somehow more noble and caring than people who live in big cities. 2)The lead male character doesn't really come to life within the reader's mind. However, that could be because the book is written in the first person, so we never get to really know True. But we get to know and like Collie, and the book has it's amusing moments. I look forward to reading the next book by Lisa Wingate."
2,Disappointing,"Having recently bought a comprehensive Billy May discographyfrom the same publisher, this title was disappointing. I wasexpecting to finally have access to a complete Nat Cole discography only to find out that the ""pop"" recording sessions are omitted. The book's devoted to Cole's jazz output (mostlytrio work). At the time the Cole's career takes off (@1950)the book tails off, offering virtually no information on thelast 15 years of Cole's studio work. The book's not without value, but certainly not a comprehensive look at Cole's recording career."
4,Great for NKC Trio and Cole Piano fans,"This is still probably the most comprehensive NKC discography available, although it is slightly outdated. It doesn't contain anything that's been ""unearthed"" since 1994 (Circle room, some JATP performances, etc). Invaluable for fans/collectors of the Trio and Cole's piano work, but not for fans of Nat the ""crooner"". Probably a bit more expensive than it should be unless it gets a new edition soon..."
3,Be Patient,"Peter Mathieson's The Snow Leopard struck a chord with me. He skillfully wove his personal trials and tribulations into the fabric of an adventure story, looking for an endangered cat in remote parts of Nepal, and his study of Buddhism. The Tree Where Man Was Born falls far short of the standards he created. We learn lots about the anthropology, history, and natural environment of East Africa but little or nothing about the author. The book starts slowly and the reader waits in vain for a story. Once you realize its a travelogue, its pretty good with lots of interesting tidbits about critters and folks in this region of the world. It is by no means a nature classic as billed."
2,An Opportunity Wasted,"What an exercise in frustration! The DVD has a good conceptual framework but the translated idea is very poor and too many shortcuts were taken with the production. There is no tab displayed on the screen or in a booklet for the user to follow so you have to keep going back and forth over the scene to write down what is being said. Each scene moves quickly into the next without any numbering or title to alert you. The DVD menu does not allow you to go to a specific scene so you really have to guess or write down the time of the scene you want. Pity really, because if the DVD were done better, I would have given it 5 stars. Instead it barely gets two stars for the effort."
3,Good but simple DVD instruction,"Definitely a beginner to intermediate instruction. Good format but overly simple and short. Not that enjoyable. Dry. Better blues DVDs out there too. So middle road stuff, but best for beginners."
4,Good advice and training but boring,"This manual is good for what it is, which is an Army manual. It's a little dry to read but the information is useful."
1,out of date,"This book is out of date - stating that *the* correct way to fire a pistol is by holding it with one hand, keeping the other hand at the side."
2,dell ink,"Works fine, however the Dell printer does not recognize it so it still thinks I need to replace my ink cartridge."
1,Do not buy!,"This cartridge does not work. I ordered one, it did not work, and now I am sending the second one back to the Company ""OCInkjet.com"". The Dell printer reads out ""This printer does not support this cartridge"". This is the second time that I am having to send their cartridges back. This is the Black cartridge, and I do believe that I am going to have to send the color one back as well."
1,ink cartrige,"cartrige prints but my Dell AIO printer says low or out, of ink. When printing, a pop up comes up everytime saying ""low/no, ink, continue printing""?"
1,DO NOT BUY!!!!,My Dell M4640 Ink Cartridge did not work. The printer says the toner is low and it feels empty when I shake it. I have repeatedly tried to contact Eforcity to refound this but they have not return any of my e-mails. I feel that this company robbed me of my money.
4,"Good price, usual problem","You get what you pay for, plus a little more, with this product. Once installed, works great, coverage is very even, and seems to last well. But because it is not a Dell, my Dell printer gives me an ""out of ink"" message immediately after installation. It's not out, but that's the message. To me, it's worth the price differential to click off the error message and print away."
2,not much ink in there...,"These cartridges are messy, and while they're cheap, they don't last very long either. Buy the good ones and don't bother with these."
1,Uncompatible,For some reason I thought this item was compatible for my Dell All-In-One Printer 946? The Printer was not able to read this cartridge at all & I wasted my $ !
2,unlucky mediator,1st cartridge out of the box was dry. Second cartridge worked a bit and the machine quit. just luck I guess. I'm a mediator
2,Buy in Bulk,"I believe these are refilled used cartridges. If you really want this cartridge to work, I suggest you buy several even plenty, because although they do contain ink which will flow onto blotter paper a significant percentage will never work, even after carefully cleaning their contacts.I believe the risk in purchasing recycled ink/toner cartridges is a gamble against the quality control and post-refilling testing. These are not just ink tanks, they are sensitive electronic devices."
5,ink3,I have bought this item before and love the price. It can't be beat. It comes in the mail quickly.
1,Don't buy cartridges from these people.,"Compatible Dell M4640 Ink Cartridge. Compatible Black Ink Cartridge for Dell 922, 942, 962 PrintersNone of the three cartridges sent would be recognized as having ink on my dell photo printer."
5,New ink,These cartridges of black ink have done well for the money. We use black the most on our printer so we need more of them than the color refills. They were here quick and have been very good.
1,Bad deal,"Dell has fixed it so that this type of refill will not work in my Dell printer, I must buy ink from Dell, Bummer!"
2,Won't buy it again,"The cartridge lasted about half as long as the one I had used previously that was made by Dell. So the cheaper price was not advantageous after all. Also, the cartridge did not have the functionality of the Dell cartridge which can keep track of remaining capacity and display that info. This replacement produced a ""Cartridge is empty"" warning every time I printed causing a delay while I had to click on ""Continue printing anyway."""
2,Poor Design,"Both the battery compartment and the on/off switch are located on the back of the ""scanning"" unit. If you don't want to nail a hole in your door, but instead opt to use the double-sided sticky pads provided, you can't access either the battery compartment or the on/off switch."
2,Biometric?,"This toy is a great concept but is very misleading. It has nothing to do with gaining access using biometrics or anything that would closely resemble it. To access, you simply push a series of buttons in the order that you set them. Maybe I should have known that a cheap toy like this wouldnt employ fingerprint reading technology. My mistake."
1,No Manual,Came with no manual. No instructions. They can't be found on the web. Don't know how to use it. So not very fun.
5,Love this game!,My daughter is age 6 and in first grade. She absolutely loves this game. Every night she wants to play sum swamp before she goes to bed. This has become her very favorite and we like how it has helped her add and subtract numbers faster.
5,My 3 sons,"We have owned this game for 3 years and love it. The target age would probably be between 5 and 7 but my boys still enjoy playing this game (ages 9, 7, 5). The game not only practices addition and subtraction but also odd and even numbers. The only improvement I would recommend is additional game pieces so that more than four players can play."
5,A must-have for primary teachers,"Wow. I've never had a game that my students loved as much as this one. The ones who are advanced with addition and subtraction love it, as do the children who are beginning with those concepts. It doesn't look like it would be very exciting, but I can't seem to get my students to stop playing it. It's a fairly quick game, but they don't care, they just go back to start and play again. I get a kick out of watching them play. I ranked it a bit lower in durability simply because it's a board game and board games are never durable. But the game board itself, playing pieces and dice are of good quality and should last a while."
5,4 Year Old Loves this Game!,Our 4 year old daughter loves this game. I love it when she likes something that is teaching her. Great buy!
5,My kids keep asking to play it again and again!,"My sons are 4 yo and 7 yo and they both LOVE this game! They played it over and over and ask to play it daily. Not only do the boys have the opportunity to work on their basic addition and subtraction facts, they get to work with +1, +2 which works well with our Singapore Math curriculum. Lastly, they get to work on their evens/odds. This is a great game and I love that it makes math and homeschool work fun! I highly recommend it!!"
3,Quick and easy,"This game's fine, but it only lasts like five minutes per game. It does employ lots of math which is good, but it's awfully simple and fast. I'd rather it took a little while to play..."
4,We like it.,It is a fun game. We saw it from our friend's home. Then we order it for ourselves. It is a nice game for little kids to play.
4,Great learning game! My five year old really likes it.,"My five year old is really enjoying this game! It is simple addition and subtraction with numbers 1 through 6 so its perfect for a little one just learning math. Also, it is introducing her to the concepts of odds and evens. Good game for an affordable price - simple fun - no bells and whistles."
5,Great!,I ordered this because I thought my third grader was having trouble learning her addition/subtraction facts but...after playing 3 rounds of this game with her I discovered she knows them quite well! She loves the game and it is great for learning or reviewing.
4,Good Game,I homeschool my children. I'm always looking for fun ways to learn. It is a good game but a little too simple. Too easy and thus boring for the 5 year old I bought it for. I'm giving it to my younger nephew in the hopes that he can get more out of it than we did.
4,Xmas Present for 4 yr old Twin boys,"Mom asked for educational games. This one is a little advanced for them she said the occasionally have hard time figuring out the math but they still play and get the answe with help form Mum and Dad. They will grow into it fully in a few months, Mom says."
5,wonderful learning experience1,This game is absolutely wonderful. Great educational value and fun at the same time. Very easy to play and my six year old doesn't even realize he's learning.....just having fun! Very easy to play. We pull this game out over and over again!
5,A+,My 5 year old is adding and subtracting and not really thinking it's homework :-) Fun added to school makes learning stick and easier to teach.
5,"Marvelous..Simply Marvelous!! I Gave it 10,000 stars","This CD is just a continuation of the marvelous work that GOD is doing through the musical ministry of Mr. Richard Smallwood. A native Washingtonian myself, I have been a fan of his music for years. ADORATION will always be one of me and my wife's all time favorite, but then he hit us with REJOICE and it just took me and I'm sure others to another LEVEL!! GOD has surely blessed me many days with this heavenly sound. As a person who aspires to praise and worship GOD with my voice, I have gleaned from Richard's Smallwood's ministry. I only hope that it doesn't stop here!! Peace and Blessings to Every Believer and Non-Believer...ALIKE!!"
2,Worked good for six months then useless.,Very good coffee maker as others have pointed out. Worked for six months then began to leak severely during brewing process. It's now useless. Not built to last. My other Capresso coffee pot broke nearly right away. The feature where you can remove the carafe during the brewing process depends on a tiny plastic piece that broke off while removing the carafe rather than preventing drips. I've had experience with two Capresso coffee pots of this type and both didn't last very long. I feel it's because they used flimsy/cheap parts in critical areas.
2,"Reservoir hard, if not impossible, to clean thoroughly","If this little coffeemaker didn't make decent coffee, I would have given it one star. It does, and had I writtent a review before trying to clean the reservoir, I would have rated it at least a four.Unfortunately, the difficulty of cleaning the water reservoir--and the impossibility of removing the water indicator level from the unit to clean it--are points important to consider if you live in an area where ants periodically invade everything. Even with the use of a cleaning agent, crud remains and is unreachable.Furthermore, the carafe has a metal band around it, making it impossible to rewarm coffee in the carafe in the microwave. The ""footprint"" of this coffeemaker is bigger than it needs to be, too.Overall, these seemed sufficient reason to downgrade my rating of this coffeemaker to a two.BOTTOM LINE: There are better options. Check out the Braun in the same size. I give that a solid five."
3,Nice remix but not extended and only one version.,"The '91 remix is really in a true sense, a remix. By the early 90's remixes were pretty much meaning a complete overhaul of the song undergoing the remix treatmeant, leaving only the vocals while all the instrumentation was new. Such is not the case here. Quite frankly, some people may not even notice that this is a remix. The music for the most part is all the orignal instruments. However, there are some differences that are subtile.My 3-Star rating because the song is NOT extended from it's original length and there is only one version of the song here. This is a nice little mini-album all the music is pretty good.Here is the line-up1. Sweet Dreams (Are Made Of This) '912. Beethoven (I Love To Listen To)3. Shame4. This City Never Sleeps"
2,This book doesn't help,I took the CLEP test and failed. The material and the tests did not have the same information that was on the CLEP test. The information in this book is related to Intro to Psychology. Use another book related to child development.
3,Covers about 50% of the exam material but it helps,"I passed the exam today with a score of 65/80. Unfortunately this book only covered about 50% of the material. Luckily I remembered some of the answers from the CLEP Psychology and Educational Psychology study guides that contained some of the answers necessary for this exam. Content from those books, in addition to some common sense and educated guessing, allowed me to pass."
4,CLEP Human Growth and Development,This study guide was very helpful without being overwhelming. There were things on the test not mentioned in the book but it was a good overview. I passed the CLEP without any problems.I will try to CLEP Sociology next!
1,i didnt receive the book,"i didn't recevie the book at all, this the second time i order a book from amazon and i didnt get itthe first book was english compostion and the second one human growth and developmentim really upset about that and im asking for refund my money for both booksthanks"
1,Look elsewhere!!,"The three ""tests"" that come with the software have questions that are not even covered in the book! I had no idea where 50% of the questions on the practice tests even came from. Why they would include material on their tests that they do not even address in the review guide is beyond me. Anyway- do not waste your money!! You study and study the chapters, and when you try to take the tests you have no idea where half of them came from."
3,REVIEW FOR HUMAN GROWHT/DEVELOPMENT,I TOOK TEST AND FELT THAT THIS BOOK IS INFORMATIVE BUT NOT ENOUGH TO HELP YOU PASS THIS TEST. YOU DEFINITELY NEED A COLLEGE TEXTBOOK ON HUMAN LIFE SPAN TO PASS THIS TEST. THE TEST HAS ALOT OF INFORMATION NOT CONTAINED IN CLEP EXAM BOOK AND YOU NEED MORE DETAILS IN TERMS OF INFORMATION ON GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT. YOU CAN PASS THIS TEST IF YOU STUDY AND USE ADDITIONALY RESOURCES. A VERY GOOD BOOK TO SUPPLEMENT WITH IS HUMAN LIFE SPAN BY DIANA PAPALIA. GOOD LUCK. I REALLY FELT I PASSED BECAUSE OF THESE TWO BOOKS
3,Not the Best,"I have used the REA study guides for 4 of the 5 CLEP tests I have taken. This is the first guide that I am unsatisfied with.About 60 of the 90 questions that appeared on the CLEP test I took today were regarding child development. This REA study guide barely touches upon the theories that appeared on the actual CLEP regarding child development (especially Paiget). I would say this study guide covers about 1/3 of the actual material that appeared on the CLEP.The practice questions from the Official CLEP study guide by the College Board represent the material I saw on the Human Growth and Development test today much more than this study guide.I got a 70/80 on the test today, however, I know this is because I recently took a child development course and not because of this study guide."
3,"great info, but much more indepth than the exam itself","The book covered the exam well enough for me to score a 71, but it had a LOT of excess information that I really stressed over learning and was completely unnecessary.Check it against the College Board's content guide for the test before you stress over every detail of something that isn't on the test."
1,too much unnecessary info,"This book was a total waste of time and money. It had far too much detail unnecessary for the test. The information was not presented in a logical, easy to remember manner. A review of the main learning theories from a basic psychology book would probably prove as helpful and less frustrating. I got a 74 on the test, but common sense, logic and a little psychology background were the reasons, not this guide."
4,Passed with a 65,"I have no psychology background, but I passed with a 65. The book is useful. There is enough info in the book to pass the test, but unfortunately there is unnecessary info that they make you get down. Definitely get down everything in the book on Piaget's theory, Kohlberg's moral development theory, Erik Erikson's theory, and Frued's theory. Also make sure you get down classical conditioning, operant conditioning, and observational learning. Get down research methods (case study, correlational, cross-sectional, experimental, longitudinal, observational). There is a couple of questions on genetics not found in the book (using the Punnett square; XY Chromosome, etc.) There was also a question about Lev Vygotsky who is not covered in the book. The test deals most with child development; only one question dealing with elderly people. I supplemented the book with the Cliffnotes book on ""Developmental Psychology"" (ISBN: 0764586149)."
4,why buy?,"just wanted to write that there is no point in buying this when one can buy the HEIMSKRINGLA for not that much more. if you already own this book, i can tell you that the HEIMSKRINGLA contains tons more of the same (if you're curious, i bought this book used the same time i bought the HEIMSKRINGLA, not knowning that one was contained within the other). personally, i am not such a huge fan of the HEIMSKRINGLA as compared to the other famous sagas (egils', njal's, laexerdal, etc...), but it's still not a bad read; snorri's writing style is much more like a listing, an historical recording, than a telling of a tale (which i prefer)."

5,Great Craft Book,"This is my favorite gel candle book. The design and layout of the book are good and easy to read. There is a lot of good info and guidelines, too."
1,Disappointing,"I am just beginning to get into candlemaking as a craft and was very excited to try something new. The book is self-published and it is obvious. Some of the pictures were stretched and are blurry. There are grammar and spelling errors that, being a teacher, were hard for me to overlook. Not all of the recipes were for gel candles, which I think is a little weird given the title of the book. There were a few good ideas, but overall, I don't believe this book was worth the price I paid for it. In fact, Soapmaking for Fun & Profit gave me much better business advice (it applies to all crafts) and I found better instructions for Gel Candles on various web sites for free."
1,Don't BUY! Read This!,"Don't get me wrong, the Limp is the ultimate but this import has nothing different than the normal Amerikan version.I bought it and all that is different is that there is a booklet in japanese.It's a SHAM!No bonus track w/Eminem!"
1,what happened to limp bizkit?,if you're a limp bizkit fan and love rap you will like this cd. If you already have Three Dollar Bill Ya'll and are looking for the same hardcore you will be very dissapointed like i was. I just hope their new cd coming up won't be like this one. thank you!
3,muttluks hott doggers,"i think they are good quality and that they will probably last a long time but they will not stay on my dog's feet. i often have to replace them more than once a day.they are designed with a velcro closure that fits around the dog's leg. the problem is, my dog's leg diameter is small and the velcro just doesn't hold very tightly.the seller's service was excellent, the shipment arrived quickly and he responded to emails within a couple of hours."
2,She's not Dominican,"Uhhh, well, even though I might purchase this album, let me correct any readers/doubters : Melody is from Spain, not Dominica nor the Dominican Republic. She can sing better than most 14 year olds I know, so: there ."
2,busted,"I bought this for our son and we got some use out of it, but sure enough it broke because you can't get the games out of this thing without forcing them out. Bummer, dissapointed. The games literally get stuck inside and you have to jerk it back and forth a lot to get the games out. Would not recommend if you want it long term. eventually it's bound to break."
2,Don't Buy this Piece of Garbage,"this thing looked good in the store, and at the price, it sounded like it had to be good (I paid $60) ive seen it for $50 - $80. the video quality is really noticeably different from the Real NES, and the sound is sometimes very distorted, it is also made of really cheap plastic, and the controller it comes with, sucks, and the Game Genie usually doesn't work in it. if u never played a NES before and you bought this, you wouldn't know about all this, so just pay $50 for a used original NES somewhere with a new pin connector."
2,A Good Console if You Just Want to Play Again! (Update: Not So Much!),"I purchased the NEX Videogame Console recently and was not disappointed. All my games played in it, a couple of the older ones I had to clean first but then they played fine. My favorite feature of this console is it allows you to use the controllers from your original NES, including the zapper!Yes I will agree with the reviews that the sound in some places is a little off and the color quality isn't the same. The games also do fit a little snug. However, if you just want to be able to play your old video games that you thought were forever doomed by that awful blinking screen, this console is for you. If you want every aspect of your gameplay (i.e. sound/color) to be there 100% I would suggest finding a new original NES.UPDATE: Since this review the console no longer works. The above review applies to WORKING consoles. I recommend looking for another brand."
2,great if ya could get games out!,This would be great if the games would load and unload more easily! I'm 46 and can't get the games out without reefing on the console and my boys have to use a crowbar just about! We took it back to the store and the salesgal had a hard time getting the game out too. Too bad as it's otherwise sturdy but the abuse of forcing the game out would ruin something I'm sure!
4,Great live edge,"This is an excellent extension of RocknRoll Animal. The raw edge of the live recording is superb with Vicious,Satelitte of Love and Walk on the Wild Side real stand outs for me. My favourite is the treatment of Waiting for the Man. Crank it up ,close your eyes and check out the guitar...just great. Would have rated "" Live"" a five star if there were a few more than six tracks to saviour."
3,3 1/2 Stars,"As noted many times before, this is the rest of the show that produced ""Rock N Roll Animal"". Lou is in good voice and the band is still presenting things with an intense arena style sound.Here the emphasis is on his solo material with only one Velvet's song in the mix and the difference between the material is glaring. The solo work is much weaker than the Velvet covers, but the performance of it more than saves the day.Recommended to lovers of ""R-N-R Animal"" for the rest of the story."
4,"Not an animal, but still pretty wild","Although it may be unexpected in light of their respective cover photos, this CD contains the remainder of the performance of Lou Reed and his backers partly captured on the classic live album Rock 'N Roll Animal. The songs here are not as strong, but Lou delivers the soft majesty of ""Walk on the Wild Side"" and a power-crunch glam ""I'm Waiting for the Man,"" which is my favorite live version. Lou's guitar edge and fluidity are also displayed on the other Transformer entries and the two lengthy cuts from his dark Berlin album. Like its Berlin counterpart ""Lady Day"" on Rock 'N Roll Animal, ""Sad Song"" has great atmosphere and resonance. It is nice to hear Lou live with professional sound quality, after not having been able to experience this with the Velvet Underground live recordings."
4,2nd live album,"Get Rock n Roll animal 1st !That is a god rocking album sent from heavenWhen you know every lick, then get this.... its like the bonus CDDon't get me wrong - its good, darn good - theres just an even better one out there."
5,Best Christmas album I've ever found,"This album contains several excellent arrangements of traditional Christmas songs that are very appealing, but the greatest part is the five original songs. I enjoy listening to them not only at Christmas but year-round. The vocals are excellent and the lyrics thought provoking."
5,The Hottest Jazz Duo,"Judith Durham is one of the worlds greatest singers and is famous throughout Europe esp. England , Australia (where she was born ) and the pacific . Judith is not as famous in America but Jazz fanatics of the 70's have more than likley heard her name . Judith sings every style of music imaginable from classical to rock and on this album she is singing jazz acousticly with her husband pianist extrodonare Ron Edgeworth. The Album is 100% live with 7 of the tracks recorder at he Newport (USA) Jazz Festival the other 2 were recorded at a concert in Hobart (AUSTRALIA) . At the Newport concert Judy and Ron were only suposed to do a few songs but the crowed loved them so much thaty did seven songs lating 1 hour. None of the songs lasted more than about 5 minutes so thats a total of about 35 minutes which leaves 25 minutes in which the crowd went wild cheering this hot duo . This album is a must and also available is another jazz album she recorded with the Hottest band in town ."
2,"Should be called ""Why I think the legal system is Wrong""","I picked this book up hoping it would be about the criminal mind, as the title suggests. Instead it is mostly Dr. Kirwin's thoughts about how the legal system treats mentally ill patients unfairly. This is all prpbably true, but it is NOT what the title implies. She just goes on and on about lack of funding and peoples reaction to a not guilty by insanity plea. She talks more about the legal system than about the criminal mind. I wanted a book that talked about why criminals act the way they do. This was not it."
2,Fair,"Dr. Barbara Kirwin draws on her years of experience as a forensic psychologist to talk about some of the the most eyebrow-raising cases of the past 20 years where the insanity defense was used and abused.She has seen a lot in her line of work and readers will appreciate her insider's view, but too much of this cheap book is a wordy and repetitive diatribe against the criminal justice system. Her memory is keen and I do not question her credentials as a psychologist, but she is neither philosophical nor wise enough to be a social critic. Much of the book is like listening to a child whine about a denied sundae."
2,Heraldo Rivera show in 300 page format,"Could be titled "" The omnipotence of me "" the biography of Dr. Kirwin. The author tends to embrace that which she condemns in others in that by poking holes in the professional diagnosis of other equally accredited members of the psych. community one must consider the potential falability of her arguement from their professional viewpoint. Some interesting behind the scenes of high profile cases. A snoozer for the most part. As they say in the movie industry, this one is a rental not a keeper."
5,Heavenly voice,An angelic interpretation of celtic folk songs -- spiritual in the true sense of the word. Highly recommended.
5,A great book to go along side that of Colin Duriez,"I agree with the previous reviewer. This is by far the best of the illustrated books on Tolkien - Jude Fisher is the pen name of one of the top experts on Tolkien, Lewis and other such great authors - and if you want pictures, this is it. But if you want intellectual depth and insight, you should also buy the brilliant books by Colin Duriez, who has by now written several on the Inklings, including his new great book on the friendship of Lewis and Tolkien. Go for a Fisher/Duriez combination! Christopher Catherwood, author of CHRISTIANS MUSLIMS AND ISLAMIC RAGE (Zondervan 2003) and CHURCHILL'S FOLLY (Carroll & Graf 2004)"
3,think twice,"if you already bought the visual companion to fellowship and two towers then this book is a disappointment. too many photos from the previous two films. Not enough images from return of the king. especially missing when they shouldn't be are photos of grond, shelob the spider, the king of the oathbreakers and orc general gothmog. the photo guide is better value."
3,Good story line but very low budget amatuer acting,We are time travel junkies and buy everything we see about it. This is a cute little movie if you can get past the amatuer hour acting. It is obviously a low budget one man show but it has an interesting storyline and I didn/t turn it off early.
4,Great Canadian Praries Rock,A definite original! The songwriting style of Bachman & Cummings couldn't have come out of anywhere but the Canadian midwest. The sometimes nieve (or maybe just young) lyrics and fresh/clean instrumentation combine with melodies an artist of any genre would be proud of.The marathon KEY (the one with the obligatory drum solo)is still interesting to listen to thirty years later and has definitely aged better than FRIENDS OF MINE from Wheatfield Soul. The musical styling is more diverse and the lyrics both poetic and insightful without being overly preachy.The album ends with some really tasty guitar styling by Randy Bachman in FAIR WARNING. A tune with a message as relevent today as thirty years ago.
1,SKY HAWK tw-742,"i've got one big grip!!! YOU CANNOT FIND SPARE PARTS! before buying, try to find someone selling a spare wing or tail section. (or any other part for that matter) unless your an expert with remotes and never bend up any parts, stay away. (i must say it was fun for about 20 seconds)"
3,Memories of the King,This was an okay dvd. It had about the same as other dvd's about his life. There could have been more and better information on this particular one. There are other dvd's out there about Elvis that I liked a lot better.
2,Disappointed,I was most disappointed in this product. Maybe I missed the description but there was no music just interviews from various people about Elvis. I would not recommend this at all.
4,"Even though its 3 hours, you will keep rewatching it","...So I keep watching and feeling my mouth is open in shock, without my mouth actually being open. It's his steady, calm patter of words, describing horror after horror with a detachedness rivaling *HAL*, that generates a feeling of being both hypnotized and skewered at the same time...read the rest at:[...][...]"
3,"It's okay, but a bit more structure would have been nice","This documentary is pretty ok as an introduction to Chomsky and his ideas. Especially in his debate scenes I think he outshines his opponents with his logic. It is highly viewableBut the doc would have been better if there was a more structural approach to the whole theme of Chomsky's work and the interplay between politics, democracy and mass controlled media.But it is a daunting task to do such a thing with the prolific work Chomsky has left in writing and speaking. It's not easy to make a document of the greatest philosopher of our time."
2,Chomsky on Chomsky,I recently bought this DVD and was really looking forward to seeing it. Halfway I stopped watching it. Disappointing!
5,One of the best documentaries ever.,"I'd give it 6 stars if I could. The material is great not only because it's Chomsky speaking on interviews and lectures, but because the documentary is incredibly well made, truly excellent. Consistent, serious, funny, scary, but mainly important. This is a must-see video, it should be on every TV in the western world every morning, so people could learn about indoctrination, thought control, etc, and maybe identify with it as I did. We are very much an indoctrinated and though-controlled society, but some of us can't see that clearly for some reason. This video made me feel very ashamed - because I do music for commercials too - but hey...a musician gotta make a living....give a guy a break!"
3,Not much meat,"This is my first exposure to Noam Chomsky after becoming interested in him from quotes and exerpts in other books and documentaries.While this documentary does have some interesting parts, it does not go into much depth about him nor his material. After 3 hours, I didn't feel like I had a better understanding, just the same general idea of what he proposes and stands for.I think this documentary would be more interesting for someone who has already read one or some of his books. I will still have to get one of his books because the documentary was not enough on its own."
4,Mandatory Viewing,"Possibly the best antidote to the FOX news syndrome, this should be mandatory viewing for anyone interested in maintaining the ability to look through the headlines. My only quibble with this film is the hokey 'art-school' gimickry style that gets in the way of the content from time to time."
4,Well worth the time and money,"This is an excellent, low-budget film, that chronicles the life and thoughts of America's toughest critic, Noam Chomsky.The number and range of reviews displayed here prove that this is a film worth seeing. The film's director does a masterful job of revealing Chomsky - his politics, his vision and the keen, analytic scientist who pioneers discovery.For the past 3 decades Chomsky has turned that keen, scientific mind towards America; it's politics and it's power. This film delves into the control the media exerts, the subtle and not-so-subtle ways its used to control and influence America's political posture."
4,Intelligent introduction to one of our most interesting thinkers,"Often fascinating, if arguably overlong (167 min of talking heads). While it only scratches the surface of Chomsky's many ideas, this is a worthwhile introduction to both the man, and one particular element of his theories - namely that all major US media is only serving the interest of the corporate/government oligarchy. Never boring, but sometimes repetitive. Gets brownie points for being willing to clearly present intelligent opposing points of view, despite the film's obvious siding with Chomsky. Loses brownie points for stylistically doing some of the very sort of manipulative story-telling Chomsky is railing against, and for focusing on certain aspects of his ideas too long at the expense of others. Another DVD where the extras (especially the complete creepy/fascinating face-off between Chomsky and William Buckley) are sometimes even more exciting than the film itself."
4,Awesome...if you're up to it.,"This film is to ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" what a symphony is to a ragtime pianist: infinitely more complex, multilayered, subtle and incisive...but also far less accessible to the average viewer with the typical 15-second attention span.I've never read any of Chomsky's books, only excerpts and reviews and lots of casual mention of him but in this film he comes across as surprisingly good-humored, down to earth and likeable. Nothing like the raging paranoid ivory tower freak that the wingnuts like to caricature him as.Tons of ""aha!"" moments while watching...but try not to watch this film after a heavy meal.4.5 stars"
5,Great introduction to difficult material,"I've never been able to slog through any of Chomsky's books, but this documentary is completely accessible. He has some great insights into how the media really works, and what that means for our society.I've seen this movie several times, and it is still just as relevant as when it first came out. If anything, the issues Chomsky addresses have become more urgent today."
1,"Not even ""star"" worthy","This product is such a disappointment. Its ""resin"" is a light weight plastic - the marbelized look is only for show. As soon as you hold it you know it's very poorly made - the razor doesn't balance well and the brush is top-heavy - It should be equally weighted. Not at all worth using, in my opinion. Also, the gold holder, while looking fantastic on the ad, comes tarnished and pitted. This is just such poor quality, I wouldn't even give it to my nephew as a ""starter""."
5,"Smells Like Creed Himalaya, Costs A Lot Less","I was sampling various colognes for my girlfriend, so she could pick a favorite. Unfortunately, she picked Creed Himalaya, which is rather expensive.Fortunately, I also had a sample of XS, known as the poor mans Himalaya (I prefer the term frugal).She says she likes XS even better than Himalaya. I'm not sure if she just said that to make me feel better about buying the cheaper XS, but either way, she approves and I get to save $100."
4,brings back memories,"This fregrance brings back a lot of memories. I've been using it since 1997 when I was 13 years old.It's somehow become ""my"" scent.Very good smell, but there are better out there."
3,The Butler did it,"Another Agatha Christie, what can I say... If you like all the others you'll like this.Try a real book sometime. There are plenty on amazon. You could try Our Mutual Friend by C Dickens."
4,A book for mothers,"""The Incredible Truth about Mothers"" tells us about motherhood through the world of animals. The photos of mother animals and baby animals are adorable. Pre-readers will love it as a picture book. Young readers will be able to read it, but it's written more for mothers, so there are things mentioned that might not be age appropriate. My 8 year-old read it before I had a chance to read it and I'll have to say, it went over her head. There is one photo of bears mating, a few mentions of ""damn,"" one reference to a teen sneaking back home from a secret date. It's otherwise very tame. My daughter loved it, but she did ask me how to read ""damn.""I did enjoy it. It's a quick read. The photos dominate, with a one sentence or less caption on each page. Very cute."
5,Awesomely uplifting and clever tribute to moms,"Awesomely uplifting and clever tribute to moms- He did it, again....Bradley Trevor Greve wrote another book that is the perfect gift for any mother.... or anyone that loves cute photos of animals."
2,"Cute pictures, but...","I'm expecting my first child, and my mother gave me this book because she knows I like animals (especially the cute babies!) After reading the book, though, I was downright depressed to the point of tears about becoming a mother. It basically tells you your children will be horrible terrors and not ever appreciate a thing you do, and that your husband will be even worse! The writing is bitter and twisted compared to the pictures. I do give a couple stars, because the pictures are cute if you don't read the text."
2,Not interesting to me.,"Not very interesting to me, maybe I need to start it over and watch the whole movie;then give a review."
3,Some short films still better in their short format,"I loved the original short for years, but I must say that I'm quite dissappointed with the full length film. The storyline it's quite poor, the characters not too well developed and the casting of the three leads it's totally wrong.The two young actors of the orginal short film were far way better than these three ones.Hope that the next Adam Salky film could be better than this one. I didn't agree at all with all the previous positive reviews. Sorry!"
2,2 1/2 stars for an early Rooney Mara film,"I will admit I searched out this movie only to see more of Rooney Mara's work. She doesn't have a big role as the best friend of headliner Emmy Rossum but she's just fine. The other surprise is Zach Gilford from the TV series ""Friday Night Lights"". The movie essentially attempts to add a serious spin on high school sexuality where a group of friends can't quite figure out if they like girls or boys...or both. I'm not sure I buy the premise but hey what do I know. Yes, there's lots of talk and clothes-on action, but when the rubber meets the road, the cast and filmmakers cop out. I don't ever remember this movie being in theaters and I can certainly see why."
2,Hmmm,"It was sort of a weird movie. I did not like how the end just abruptly ended. I still don't quite get what was going on with Johnny. I won't say it was bad, but I also won't say it was good."
3,The Voice Is There,"The second of the 3 album Juice Newton recorded with her band as ""Juice Newton & Silver Spur"" this one didn't launch any hit (or even near hit) singles but the elements of the first album and the hits to follow are there.Unlike the debut album, the rock and roll is notched up a tad more on After the Dust Settles and the result is more in the vein of the California Rock of the mid 70's but that's not a bad thing at all and comes across with a full on bar band vibe.Some of the highlights include the kiss off of ""Bye Bye Baby"" and ""If I Ever"" which show off Juice's pipes. Though truth be told you can tell by the end of the album that her voice is in great shape and the album has a great fun filled feel to it, even with the ballads. But alas it's still not as good as the things that were still yet to come from Juice Newton.And at least we all now have a chance to hear these ""lost"" albums on CD - so a big kudos to Wounded Bird Records."
2,a strong argument against academic tenure,"Here is an educated man, isolated from peer review, re-warming ancient, pointless Populist ideas about a subject he knows only by association. Without the bulwark of tenure, he could have been challenged to have written something less formulaic and outdated.What is more the pity is that he cares about his subject; he is just not used to having to defend his ideas, so he just comes off as a boring, monomoniacal old professor. One without an editor."
5,Giftee was pleased,"I gave this video as a gift, and the recipient was thrilled. I have owned it myself for years, and it is the best documentary of Bob Dylan around. Price was great, shipping was very fast, I am happy!"
4,Cheating the point,"Bob Dylan/ No Direction Home/ a martin Scorsese Picture (DVD): The point of this film is to show the history of Bob Dylan up to the ""Judas"" incident when Bob was going electric. There are some essential moments in this film, which make the film essential for any Dylan fan. However, Scorsese purposely makes the sound of the key electric performances louder and more chaotic than they really were in order to push the point he (the filmmaker) is trying to make. That trick was unnecessary and is extremely irritating. It is a big enough error in judgment to drop this film from five stars to four stars."
5,The Best Movie,"No Direction Home is simply the best movie I'll ever watch, buy, or own. My thanks to Martin Scorsese for this wonderful gift. I recommend it to anyone who loves Dylan, who remembers the sixties or who doesn't, who loves music, poetry and yes - genius."
5,Incredible,"I was incredibly pleased by this documentary, and being 26 and at the younger end of Bob Dylan's fan base, I didn't really have a context to put his earlier music into. I'm a big Dylan fan, but it was all my parent's time, not mine.Watching ""No Direction Home"" for me made it much more personal, and gave it an incredible depth. It gave me the ability to personally connect to the music, even though I am far removed from it. The performances were great, the interviews enlightening, and I saw in Bob Dylan everything I had hoped.Truly a timeless documentary, and definetly worth the time whether your into Folk music history, Bob Dylan history, or even just period history. If anyone was an icon of the times, whether he wanted it or not, it was Bob Dylan..."
2,Tanlgled up in Boredom,"It's hard to tell which is more confusing - this terribly unfocused rambling documentary or its insufferable subject. Bob Dylan has always struck me as nothing more than a very coy businessman. With a few exceptions (Tangled up in Blue, Shelter from the Storm), his music is quite feeble in terms of melodic composition, lyrics and actual performance. This documentary, like many of Dylan's sheep fans, confuses pretentiousness with profundity. I gave it two stars for the backround scenery in the old film footage."
1,Only Fullscreen????,"I can't believe this is only offered in fullscreen and not a widescreen version. I realize they aired this on television, but there must be a fullscreen version coming out. I'm waiting until there is. I have a large screen tv and I want to take full advantage of it. Plus, fullscreen sucks, you lose so much of the picture."
1,Ummmm..........huh? Did Dylan die in the late 60s?,"I was so disappointed with this documentary. Why does it only go through the late 60s? Dylan has THIRTY more years of his career, which is ENTIRELY ignored in the film. Martin Scorsese made this? What? Oh how the mighty have fallen. To me, the most interesting part of Dylan's career was when he turned his back on all the folk music/hippy nonsense and got real, real weird - but you won't see any of this in this clunker. Avoid."
4,Like a Complete Unknown,"Finally a good documentary on Bob Dylan! What I liked best about this film: great concert footage including audience booing when he played his electric guitar, Bob Dylan today commenting on aspects of his early career, backstage film clips, getting background on the folk music scene at the time, seeing Al Kooper, Joan Baez and Maria Muldar among others relating stories and the long running time, enough to include lots of music and old clips. The film seems to end pretty much when Dylan had his motorcycle accident in 1966. Some things that struck me - how incredibly lame some of the questions from the press were at the time to Dylan, a ""misunderstanding"" between Baez and Dylan still exists today, how changeable Dylan's choice of music has been (rock,folk, protest (anti-war), country) - is this to maintain his or his audience's interest?, and the utter beauty of Joan Baez's voice. Extras include concert footage. Recommended."
4,Paddy the Irishman,It was sad to witness Liam Clancy as a caricature of the drunken Irishman.His contribution was a negative.
3,who's bob dylan? scorsese doesn't know.,"in this documentary you will learn a lot about hibbing minnesota in the 1950s. also, the nyc folk scene in the early 1960s. you'll see all the outtakes of ""don't look back"" (including a little bit of dylan and the band playing). and dylan being interviewed by an off camera friend. besides the history lesson what do you learn about bob dylan? not much. i figured that with both bob dylan and martin scorsese this documentary had to be great. it's not. instead it's very long and somewhat boring. i did watch the whole thing but then i'm a big bob dylan fan. disappointing and very overrated."
5,GREAT doc!,Learned alot about DYLAN and really enjoyed this! Glad some people made it into this film before they passed.
4,Baffling Omission,"A great documentary, except for one glaring and baffling omission: the film does not even mention ""The Times They are a-Changin',"" either the song or the album. How can you make a documentary about the early years of Dylan's career, but not even mention this landmark work. It's arguably the most significant topical song Dylan ever wrote, not to mention the song most associatied with Dylan's role as ""voice of a generation,"" and a centerpiece of his performances from 1963-66 (he opened most shows with this song).Was there some legal reason that this was omitted? Very strange."
3,Classic Bob Dylan,"The first time I watched this DVD, I was mesmerized. It was so intriging to see Dylan in concert and in real life. It is raw and it is real. What a unique character he is and was. It was interesting to hear Bob speak now about his life back in the the 60's. He has mellowed so much, but still maintains his unique personality."
4,Worth watching,"As a fan of Bob Dylan's music, I am not going to analyse him or this documentary piece by piece. He can be (or pretend to be) whoever he wants to be, it doesn't matter to me.I wanted insight into how he created his music and where he came from, and I believe I gained it by watching this documentary. Bob avoids answering anything concretely in the interview portions of this documentary and remains as elusive as ever, but that does not mean you will not learn anything about the man. This is a time capsule of sorts, showcasing various moments in his early career.I think this documentary does an adequate job of telling the story of a man who wishes to remain mysterious. And that's all."
5,Excellent!,"This is a great movie! Everyone should see this, if for no other reason, the history that is involved when you watch it."
5,"Gift, gift, gift...","I sent this to my dad for Christmas last year as a stocking stuffer. I did not get to see it, but my dad went on and on about how great it was. Takes him down memory lane, and Dylan was such a revolutionary musician. He was so enthralled he went out and bought hard to find Dylan albums, and went to see him in concert recently in Indiana. Like I said, I didn't see it, but my father loved it."
5,Facinating sounds and stories; getting to know about Bob Dylan more!,"I bought this DVD for my husband for his Christmas gift, and he has been playing it almost everyday before going to bed. He simply loves it dearly and enjoyed watching and listening to it very much. Somehow, we both just enjoyed it so much and can never get tired of it. Thank you for the fantastic production of this DVD. We think it's one of the best DVD of the time!"
5,BRILLIANT!!!!!!!!!! BUY IT NOW!,"Dylan starts off by saying: ""I was born very far from where I was meant to be, I was on my way home"". This set the tone for the entire production.Well directed and put together. I was riveted."
4,Best Dylan documentary but it stops in the mid sixties,"The story just stops cold. No Woodstock, no Rolling Thunder, no Hurricane Carter and no Christian period. Excellent as far as it goes, but ...."
3,Bob Dylan- No Direction Home,"A very welldone study of an American music icon. It showed why he had a fallingout with the folk ""establishment"". The performance segments are a true treasure for any music lover."
5,10 Essentials of Highly Healthy People,"Concise, amusing, helpful and entertaining look at how to improve your health by engaging all areas of your life: physical, emotional, and spiritual. A wonderful book to motivate one for significant changes in health as well pithy anecdotes! Enjoyed it immensely."
1,Looks Solid but that's about all..!,"After reading good reviews about Chapin Company, I ordered this sprayer (its sibling 2 Gallon had decent reviews). It has many good features / accessories such as non clog filter, measuring cup, and spray shield. Out of the box you can tell it is well constructed (better that the improvement store sprayers - such as Roundup and RL Flo-Master sprayers - that I have tried in the past). The hose, brass tip, and the plastic container are all well built (the wand is very small and flimsy). But the main issue is it does not spray well (adjustable cone nozzle). The spray goes from a heavy stream to a wide cone (again heavy), with very little variation in between. I have read the customer reviews for the Chapin Premier 1 Gallon Sprayer (21210) which I am interested in and I came accross exact same customer complaints regarding the spray pattern.Chapin are you reading this ? Please use customer feedback for continuous improvement of your products."
2,Disappointed,I will never order this brand of watch again. It was purchased as a Christmas gift - I did not receive the color I thought I ordered and on top of that the watch did not work. Had to go out after Christmas and purchase a new battery which added $8 (plus tax) to the cost.
2,Ralf is wasted in this bland effort,"Next to DC Cooper, Ralf is my favorite singer at the moment. Whereas the first Primal Fear CD was almost Ralf's vengeful I-shoulda-been-chosen-as-the-new-Priest-singer effort, and he made the most of it with a top notch power metal CD on par with any Priest album, this album shows a weary, tiresome, void of creativity band. Yes, it is heavy and fast, but it lacks melody and is just plain boring. I wouldn't be surprised if all of these songs were leftovers from the first CD. With few exceptions, it is a CD of filler songs. Ralf can growl better than anyone, but I miss the days when he incorporated more of his operatic ability. He needs to surround himself with more creative musicians - Come on Ralf, you can do better than this!"
1,very average metal,"not particularly technical or inspired metal from the Judas Priest imitator Primal Fear. No heart, soul, or decent lyrics. Certainly no blistering Gamma Rayish guitars or drums. Overall sound quality is good. Slightly better than the first album, but really, neither is worth buying"
5,One of my favorites,One of my all time favorite Historical Romances....I have read this book atleast 4 times...that is how good it is.
4,"For a historical romance, it was okay.","I was looking for a novel to fill the gaps between Diana Gabaldon's books.The Good: I found myself concerned about the heroine of the novel, and it was a quick, easy read. The villains were truly gritty and the author did not hold back in her descriptions of the treatment of victims of war.The Bad: Some of the interactions were fairly unbelievable. Hey, my parents just died, but you have awesome abs!! Also, the language seemed very modern, and the descriptions of clothing did not match the historical time period.Overall, a quick read that kept my interest, but I did not love the book."
3,A Near Miss...Almost But Not Quite,"Margaret MacDonald is betrothed to Lachlan Ross, a wealthy landowner and cousin to Scotland's King Alexander III. She is excited to begin her new life and move away from her family and the responsibilities of caring for all of her little brothers. But Margaret's dreams are not to be. What awaits her is a nightmare of death, destruction and betrayal. Her home is destroyed and her family murdered, one of her brothers lives but has been taken hostage. Margaret is determined to find him.I was a bit disappointed by the story-telling and the writing. They weren't awful but they weren't terrific either. I wanted to be moved by the emotions of the characters and I just wasn't.The story itself wasn't bad. There's a lot of history and long list of characters but they just didn't come to life for me. I found the writing style a bit stiff. I really wanted to like this book but it just didn't do it for me."
2,Don't be fooled....This is not much of a romance.,"Let's face it - we're all looking for a good, romantic story-line...and some gratuitous ""heaving bosom"" love scenes! This is mainly historical fiction. I read through 370 pages of murder, rape, and cruelty to get barely a page of glossed-over love making! If you want history, read Alison Weir...at least it's real.Having said that, I did like the characters - I wish the author had developed more of their ""sixth sense"" of knowing one another in a previous life. And, I wish she had placed them together in the story line more often....Unfortunately, they were only together for 20% of the book - the other 80% was devoted to battle scenes descriptions."
5,Wonderfully captivating,"As a reader of historical novels which take place in Scotland, and I've read quite a few, this is one of the BEST. It is detailed and rich in history, much like Gabaldon's Outlander [[ASIN:0385319959 Outlander] and the characters are unforgettable. This is not a book for the faint hearted, as the scenes depicted can be brutal. Nor is it a predictible romance like most ""highland romances"" published. It is a true historic fiction, with characters that are heartbraking, beautiful but flawed, and a storyline that grabs you from the start. Read it and savor it. The authors untimely death in January, 2010 means some of the sequel stories that beg to be told will never be. We've lost a master storyteller."
3,A bit too much violence,"This was my first Kathleen Givens book and I will probably be looking for additional book(s) to see what happens to Nell and Davey. I had really mixed emotions about this book. I basically enjoyed it and thought it was a good story; however, the extreme number of people who were killed was very disturbing. I know that in the time period this book covers people were in fact being killed in raids but when I read a ""romance"" novel I pretty much want to enjoy the book and I can't say that I enjoy reading a book in which so many people (particularly family members of the main characters) are brutally killed. And when many of those killed are children, I just can't enjoy reading about it. If I find the book or books about Nell and Davey I really hope they are not quite so bloody. I think ""On a Highland Shore"" is to books what ""Friday the 13th"" and ""Halloween"" are to movies. I guess its a slasher book!"
1,Boring,"This book is boring and you don't get to feel for the characters. It is predictable and not believable. It was hard to read it until the end. It is going straight to the dustbin. There is no real romance, nor adventure, or any original story. I am sorry I bought this and the second in the series (Rivals for the crown) at the same time for I would definitely not buy the second one after reading the first."
5,On a Highland Shore,This book is a great read. I found it to be fast moving and very hard to put down. It's an epic love story about the trials one faced in Scotland in the mid 1200s. Fantastic main characters as well as strong supporting characters. I recomend this book to anyone who loves Scotland and beleives in the existence of destiny and true love. I can't wait to hear Nells' story!
3,Unfortunate Ending....,"Enjoyed the story line. However, with the unfortunate passing of the author, two of the characters of this story, who would have had their own stories told in sequels, was never completed. This leaves the reader with a lot of unfinished questions, and looking for closure to this storyline."
4,Fast reading,Really great writing even though I felt the plots were unrealistic. Total annihilation of ones family makes it hard to believe the sugar coating of a happy ending. I still enjoyed the historical aspects and really liked the 2 leads.
5,A dame is a dame,"This book is a fascinating compendium of women in Greek and Roman Egypt. It's easy to read and full of detail about the women who lived in these worlds. When you read about the personal lives, you are struck by the fact that not that much has changed: women back then met a guy, got married, had kids, and then they died. Sound familiar? And then you can't help but ask, is that all there is? There are helpful maps and a glossary."
3,the Other tracks save this set:the Girl is Mine never worked,"I dig the Mixes&some of the other cuts on here.""the Girl is Mine"" was Corny to Me back in the day&still is to this day.of the MJ&Paul mccartney tracks only ""Say,Say,Say"" is worth seeking out to me.there are some cool mixes here."
3,"MRW - good book, wrong edition","Curiously, while I kept my chemistry book, I have lost my original physics book, so I got this from Amazon. MRW was my freshman physics text - but I had a later edition than the one I bought. Still good for memories, though."
4,Watch your battery,"Absolutely love the features, ease of use and compact size. Hate, hate, hate what happens when the batteries get low. On one occasion I noticed the battery indicator was showing ""midpower"" (not even ""low""), attempted to back everything up onto the module and ended up losing everything in a freeze (now I know why they call this model ""ice""). To keep this from becoming a love/hate relationship I suggest backing up often and really watching the battery."
1,Very Disappointed,"I bought the Visor after placing my faith in a new company, and for the facts that they use the PALM OS, and the price is reasonable. What a mistake. After owning the VISOR for 2 months, the system crashed, and will no longer function. So, I lost my faith in a company and my investment. So now what? Now I'm going to do what I should have done in the first place. Buy a PALM. I suggest the same to everyone. One of my co-workers bought a VISOR as well, and he too has trashed his VISOR, and is going to buy a PALM."
3,"Great, but why not a better display",I use my Visor all the time- I wear it on my belt - I use the add on module area to carry pills in. Love the thing EXCEPT:The display stinks - All of the PDAs have really lousy displays - NO I don't want color - I want better contrast ratio and get rid of the glare! I'd pay more for a better display (throw a bit more RAM in at the same time.) The Glare is so bad that someone wrote a program that blacks out the screen so you can use it as a Mirror!One other tip - I find that the pen point of the optional pen stylus works better than the stylus that comes wit it - requires much less pressure and does not scratch it. Just throw the stylus cover away.
1,Pocket PC is the Way to Go,"I have a Visor and really like it. But I've since looked into Pocket PCs and now regret buying the Visor. The Compaq Aero 1550 is a comparable size and price, but it's features are vastly greater. It has 16 MB memory, a voice recorder, a rechargable battery, an audio jack to play MP3 files, a compact flash port, which is superior to the Springboard, and Pocket versions of MS Office programs."
5,americas other jesus,"Americas Other Jesus will never be one of those books that hit the most popular list because it tells the truth. It is a fact today that most people don't want the truth and that includes christians. Christianity has turnen into just what the author of this book says another christianity or in his words another Jesus. The auther speaks plainly and matter-of-factly and thats another thing this book has against it because people want to have their ears tickled not wrung with the truth.We need more books like this and more people to speak out even if its against all odds. I want to thank this author for doing just that.Marilee Sykes, An American living in South Africa"
4,A completely different perspective of the last 500 years,"Once every 20 years or so, a writer comes along that can tell a story, that grabs you by the lapels and won't let you go. The author is Raymond Hendrix. Both startling in its clarity, and sweeping in vision, this book challenges the assumptions of both friend and foe of the American experience. Have you ever wondered how the early settlers of America came to be hated by the aboriginals of this land? The book covers that and more. From the horrid treatment of the first natives encountered, and the trail of tears, to the subject of abortion. Is it a symptom of a sick society, or the hand of God. I highly recommend this book. Whether you agree with his assessment of history and the ripples that still move through our times. This book will stimulate thought."
1,***$20 Re-Stocking Fee ** SERIOUSLY**,"I felt that the DVD was a little overpriced to begin with but, I bought it anyway to share with my students. I am a high school biology teacher and after watching it a couple times realized that the information was clearly not worth the price of the DVD. I understand paying for the shipping but to charge $20 for a restocking fee ... that is ridiculous! It arrived in a home-made saran wrap covering to begin with and was likely sold as new but probably ""used"" to begin with. Bad company! *spank*"
3,Not for kids,I am looking for a video about the human body to show to middle school kids. This one is x rated. Not appropriate for children.
5,works well,I started using this herbal medicine when I started working nights and had a hard time sleeping during the day. I take one and about 20 minutes later I am knocked out. Also I wake up about 6-8 hours later feeling pretty good even though my bed is super uncomfortable.
3,Not effective as I hope,I got this to take with me on long haul flights to help put me to sleep. It helps initially to put me to sleep but I would end up walking not too long after wide wake. I've tried taken 1-3 pills but same effect at home or on the plane. At least it doesn't give me the groggy effect. I probably wouldn't rely on it and will just take it on desperate attempts. I probably should rate it at 2 stars but I really like that its a natural product at least.
5,No groggy feeling in the morning!,"I love that this is a natural pill that helps me to fall asleep quickly and leaves no morning-after groggy feeling.I wake up refreshed and most importantly, not feeling as if I were drugged the night before!"
5,Great sleep aid,"Looking for something to help you fall asleep? Meletonin is the answer. With insomnia, I've struggled in the past. Now, it's easier to fall asleep and stay asleep too!"
3,It works...but....,"I found this product to be very effective getting me to sleep quickly and for a good eight hours....but, it left me with a ""hangover"" for most of the next day....I tried taking a half-pill and then a quarter-pill and the hangover was deminished but still there..... It may have something to do with drug interaction because I take medication for high blood pressure....so I won't be using this or any other sleep aid..."
4,Works as expected - Good price,"Melatonin is a good, natural way to fall asleep at night. It's particularly helpful if you have jet lag. One thing I did notice about it, is that you have to go to bed right after taking it. If you wait around for more than half an hour, then it won't have the desired effect.This melatonin doesn't work any better than other brands I have tried, so I gave it four stars instead of five. It is a great deal though, much cheaper than buying at NYC pharmacy stores."
4,Great value!,"This melatonin works well and lasts a LONG time. My only complaint is that the small, flat, round pill is not coated, so it's a little more difficult to swallow as it tends to stick to your tongue a little. However, I will definitely continue to purchase this brand."
1,Didn't work for me :(,"I bought this hoping to finally get a good night sleep. I tried it several times and all of them woke up with shortness of breath. I got really scared. I asked my doctor who told me it was rare, but it could happened. I won't be taking melatonin again."
2,"Walmart is less, Better! Sleep Products that Work Amazingly Heplful $10.84","""Walmart has a very similar product under the brand Spring Valley. It is 120 tablets 10 mg Melatonin time released with my favorite stomach vitamin B-6 10 mg ( long rest sleep) $10.64. I have had difficulty sleeping since I was at least 7. I have tried many things to sleep including Rx meds. This,Calms Forte Sleep Aid by Hyland's (2 caps are a knock out), and ""Relax Me"" Drink ( slow sleep) with the Refrigerated OJ section all at Wal-mart are the only ones I've found that work. I also have sleep tips at [...] I am in no way affiliated w/ Walmart and have never drank alcohol. Also, slows the progression of Alzheimer. Blessings and Good Health. b29349@yahoo.com"""
1,Doesn't work that well,"I've used another brand before and was hoping to try something with better reviews. It was a mistake, this has little to no effect on me. I would recommend going with a brand that has a red bottle with 300 tablets and an extra ingredient in it."
2,Hard to swallow,I believe Melatonin is helpful. I have bought another brand before. This coating is hard for me to swallow so I'm not finishing the product.
1,Don't waste your money,This is the second time I've purchased this product. The first time it lasted a year before it broke. This time it hasn't even been a month since I've had it and it broke. I closed the case and the back broke off. I have to duct tape it together so that it closes properly. I feel like I just wasted my money and could have just duct taped the other one that I had.
3,"A STUNNING SCORE, POORLY PRESENTED - so what else is new?","Sondheim's much misunderstood and maligned score is gorgeous, stunning, and timeless. It includes songs recorded by artists ranging from Sinatra (Good Thing Going) to Carly Simon (a stunning take on Not A Day Goes By). While the score is great, this recording is not.Incomplete, no notes, poor presentation - the set to own is the English setMerrily We Roll Along (1993 Leicester Cast)also available as a SUPERB single disc 70+ minute highlights set.That is the definitive version of this score!"
3,"Not as good as ""New cast Recording""","This soundttrack was okay. But the new cast recording has so much more to offer the listener. The voices are smoother and provides easier listening. (Adam Heller kicks butt on ""Franklin Shepard Inc."") I like listening to the new cast recording sometimes just to hear the brilliant voices that come across so well, and seemingly effortless, for the artists. Malcolm Gets (Caroline in the City) and Adam Heller Rock!!!! PS: I heard a rumer that Adam could possibly be on the ""Titanic on Broadway"" tour. If so, check him out!"
3,"Great Music, Mean Presentation","This is a fine recording of a profoundly moving show BUT the remastered version is presented very poorly when compared to the initial RCA release.No libretto, a few black and white photos (as compared to the original colour ones, and a superficial essay - not even a summary of the show's plot. Ridiculous.The bonus tracks are of minimal interest, so if you own the original, keep it. You are much better off."
2,A Novel That Had Me Scratching My Head,"I desperately wanted to like this novel more than I did. I picked it up and bought it as I was fascinated by the concept and was initially pleased. That optimisim changed about half-way through when the hard science fiction kicked in and the plot became overwhelmed by incomprehensible ""time and space"" rubbish. I wasn't looking for a simple ""Lost World"" adventure tale of daring-do, but found the explanation for the Miracle and the rushed conclusion to this story a big let down. In the end, after I laboured to the finish, I was left simply scratching my head..."
3,Two different books,"I enjoyed the beginning of this book and thought it had a lot of promise. There's so much that can be done with a new world scenario - strange lands, new life forms, adventure, suspense. But halfway through the book, it becomes this weird sci-fi metaphysical thing and the fun and excitement of the strange new world is, in my opinion, lost completely. While I basically understood the final premise, it wasn't what I was looking for from the story and was ultimately very disappointed in the end."
3,Weird and interesting,"Europe gets wiped out by a mysterious replacement continent called Darwinia (to mock people who trust science over miracles) in the 1890s. Most interesting part is how Wilson manages to explain his odd beginning (which I won't give away for those who haven't read it). Superb as that part is, Wilson confronts a problem that he really doesn't do a good job of resolving. Having created an excellent, even credible (within the explanation of the story) universe, he doesn't show the same creativity in working a plot in that universe. Instead it's a not too interesting good vs evil battle as the climax.The mystery was excellent. The rest needed help"
2,Fades fast,"Like other readers, I thought the book got off to a great start. But the plot bogs down quickly. After the first part it seems, in fact, to wander into another novel--specifically The Devil's Day by James Blish. But Wilson draws none of his characters with the same care and realism that he did in his excellent Harvest, a novel which I can hardly believe is out of print already.Adding to the disappointment is the tendency, like so many other tedious SF novels, to treat the fate of the universe in such banal terms. I winced when the predicable fallback on the misnamed Uncertainty Principle showed up at the second Interlude. It's like black holes; a handy cliche to explain just about anything..."
3,interesting,"I enjoyed the premise of this book very much, but the story seemed to run out of steam towards the middle. I think that it could have been a better book, but it meandered a little too much. Still, the premise was more interesting than any I've seen in years. I thought _Mysterium_ was a much better structured novel."
3,After a slow start Wilson leapfrogs off the map...,"This book is much better than the naysayers would have you believe but is disappointing to someone who wishes Wilson would return to the kind of personal writing found in his best work to date: ""Gypsies"". Still, ""Darwinia"" doesn't disappoint -- there are many surprises (thank the gods not just a rehashing of Jules Verne!) and some interesting characters. I'd have liked to see him develop Lily into a stronger character, but that's a small criticism. Intriguing idea that 'free-will' doesn't begin for humanity until the Darwinian invasion...what does this say about our own world, Wilson? ""Darwinia"" engages the imagination, and Wilson's writing is seductive enough to keep the reader turning pages. But I can't help wishing Wilson would give us memorable personalities like those of his first three novels. I wonder how many others feel likewise?"
3,"Edgar Rice Burroughs meets ""The Matrix""","""Darwinia"" is an eerie, frequently fascinating tale that takes place after Europe is suddenly and mysteriously transformed into an uncharted no-man's land. Guilford Law, a photographer drawn by the continent's enigma, takes part in an expedition to its interior, facing evolutionary mysteries and paradigm-toppling revelations. Wilson is one of the genre's most appealing and overlooked storytellers, and ""Darwinia"" is a canvas of cosmic scope. Unfortunately, the ending is something of a letdown after the initial build-up; ""Darwinia"" reads as a paleantological thriller unsuccessfully fused with a virtual reality shoot-'em-up, complete with interdimensional mutants and bullet-proof avatars. Edgar Rice Burroughs meets ""The Matrix."""
3,"interesting premise, but ultimately too head-scratching","At the beginning of the twentieth century, the continent of Europe is replaced (yes, replaced) by a wild, uninhabited version complete with un-Earthly flora and fauna. This is the jumping off point for a twisting, ""What is reality?"" story that aspires to be a cross between Philip K. Dick and William Gibson. Unfortunately, it's just a bit too head-scratching."
3,"okay or good, sort of","I really wanted to like this book more than I did...it sounded so promising and began well. However, I finished it feeling unsatisfied. The premise is fascinating, but it seemed that the book couldn't decide what it wanted to be about, really. The characters didn't seem real; the odd, interludes explaining that nothing really exists are a confusing disruption that don't really illuminate much (what the heck is a noosphere, anyway?). I did plow through to the end, and encountered some interesting and even one or two compelling moments along the way, but the sick, half-fascinated voyeuristic feeling wasn't the aftertaste I was hoping for."
3,What happened?,"This book started off in a very interesing and exciting fashion, and wended slowly downhill from there, dropping completely off the precipice in the last 75 pages. The next bit may contain some spoiler information, so stop reading now..... Okay, you had your chance. Some of the characters in the book have counterparts from what we would recognize as our timeline, namely a Europe that fought WWI. I do not understand why the author has Americans manning the trenches in early 1917, why he does not have any Russian characters which would clearly have been very interesting, why there are no Canadian characters since they fielded about 700,000 men in WWI etc. etc. Admittedly, these are personal preferences. All in all, an interesting sci-fi novel, but by the end the talk about computer viruses and noospheres and other pseudo-scientific goobledy-gook detracts from the story, rather than adding to it."
4,An awsom look at the past while changing it and the present.,I thought it was good. It starts out with a group of people going to explore a new Europe. You kind of wish it would stay like that. The way the story changes keept my interest. Not a lot of books hol;d it as well as this one. I Kind of wish I was the main character.
3,Disappointed - expected better from Mr.Wilson.,"I'm not sure where or how to start.... there are so many different concepts crammed into this book, almost all of them under-developed and half-finished. I thought that the first bit about Darwinia's appearance was going to be an expansion of ""Mysterium"", but the alter-ego /ghost /doppelganger threw me a bit, then the god-mind playing games was a bit too much for me to take - even re-reading some chapters several times, I confess I'm still at a loss to grasp the point. I was expecting something much better from the writer who gave us the beautiful ""Harvest"". Sorry Mr. Wilson - not my cup of tea, or rather, the tea was OK, the unfinished leaves spoiled it."
3,Wilson on drugs,"Back when Ellison was compiling the First Dangerous Visions, rumor has it he asked Phillip K. Dick to write a story for the volume while under the influence of LSD.Robert Charles Wilson must have decided to do the same thing. There are basically two novels here, a turn-of-the-century adventure novel into an alternate Europe, and a cyberpunk ""Good AI vs. Bad AI"" SF book. While each would have been interesting in its own right, the two together never really seem to mesh well. Several characters (Vale, for example.) are virtually pointless, and the whole ""dead soldiers from WW1"" bit seemed totally tacked on.Personally, I could have easily accepted never knowing why Darwinia appears. The alternate world had some wonderful possibilities, yet they go sadly unrealized.All that said, it's not a _bad_ book. I didn't have to force myself to finish it. There are enough good ideas to keep you interested, but overall the book is a bit of a mess."
3,It had me going...at first. Six legged animals?,"It started off well. A new Europe to discover with wierd animals and plants developed along side of us but in a different zone. If they just continued to probe Europe and met up with another race it would have been more readable. The Sentience, ghosts, noospheres and all the mysto stuff didn't match the Indiana Jones beginning and quite honestly, lost me. I'm dumb and wanted more of a adventure novel. The idea that intellegence in the cosmos could replicate our world in a sphere as we believe God has, was a interesting twist but still too hard to swallow. Robert Wilson, the Bible beat you to it."
2,A great idea poorly executed.,"The concept for the book is wonderful. I was truly excited over the prospect of reading it. The book let me down. The content is choked with cliches, very predictable from the mid-point on, and finishes in too big of a hurry. I did, however, like Wilson's techniqe for introducing new concepts -- sort of an inverse Socratic method, where the pupil (reader) is induced to ask his own questions which lead to later understanding. This could have been an outstanding book. But, it isn't."
2,"the 1st half was good, but the 2nd half was predicable","Maybe I was looking for a lost world type of book. The 2nd half of the book reminded me of a B movie, you knew the end before you could begin. The 1st half was filled with great discriptions of an alternate world and all of the strange creatures that could live there"
2,mediocre,"Unfortunately it's hard to bond with the characters since they seem underdeveloped. Furthermore, the enemy is also hard to hate---they are just entities created by a computer virus. I know the notion of wanna be sentient supercomputers makes for a great enemy---but a computer virus which simply wants to replace our history with its own! I guess I'm just disappointed."
3,mixed feelings ....,"I have mixed feeling on this one because of the last 20% of the book. It just got rather weird and uninteresting as the 2 sides started to morph into the battalions that they became. Bottom line, interesting read if you are patient and enjoy complexity."
3,What happened here?,"The first half of the story was very good, telling the tale of a world in which Europe disappeared overnight. But halfway through, the story starts to get real weird and by the end it's pretty dissapointing."
3,could have been better,Starts out pretty interesting but less than halfway through becames boring and monotonous. This could have been an interesting story and instead we have something entirely forgettable.
3,What a great promise of a book that crashed in the middle...,"This book was great the first 100 pages or so, when there was a scientific exploration that went to the new continten of the old Europe ""Darwinia"". Up to that point i couldn't put the book down, and then in crashed in the middle taking a turn that i wasn't expecting at all, i am actually not really sure what happened in the book, this book left me with a ""WTF"" happened here? Sorry, but in my opinion, it could have been so much better."
2,A lost opportunity for speculative fiction,"One could anticipate that a fully satisfying explanation for the replacement of Europe by ""Darwinia"" may not eventuate, and it was not for this that I read the novel. Rather, the impetus was the occurrence of such an event within an early twentieth century setting. Unfortunately the scientific, political and other ramifications of this were not adequately explored, and using the context to simply highlight that creationist beliefs are deficient represents a lost opportunity for the novel to be of greater relevance and significance (in terms of speculative fiction). However, it is the novel's progression into shallow violence and horror that are its weakest aspects, with the few passages producing ""put the book down and ponder"" moments belittled by juvenile accounts of humans morphing into bug-like aliens."
3,disappoints in the end,"i greatly enjoyed the first 1/3 of this novel--that was when i thought it would be an alternate history of what this century would have been like if europe disappeared. although that plot line does not completely go away (it lingers in the background for the rest of the novel) the plot that replaces it is needlessly convoluted and much less interesting. i was disappointed that wilson felt he had to explain the disappearance of europe at all, keeping it a mystery and leaving the characters to wrestle with its consequences for science and religion would have been much better than the worn-out ""battle for the fate of the universe"" plot that emerged."
2,A slog and not worth the price.,"I bought this after reading ""Spin"", expecting more. More....what exactly? I don't know. I didn't like the timeframe of the novel. I didn't like the underlying idea. I didn't like the characters....ANY of the characters (except, perhaps, the frontiersman). I don't like bugs. I don't like powerful bug overlords. I don't like fern trees. I don't like the idea of saddling up my oversized grub for a ride. Yechhh.Did I tell you how much I didn't like this book?I didn't like the novel.What I really didn't like was the Kindle price. It was way too expensive compared with excellent self-published sci-fi.I wouldn't recommend this novel to anyone who truly enjoys classic sci-fi."
2,"Great premise, Fantastic beginning, disapointing overall",The book jacket description and the beginning of the book hold so much promise. It is unfortunate the author abandons these gems and switches to a much less interesting storyline a third of the way into the book. Maybe if the new story was better it wouldn't have been such an overall disapointment.
3,At the Alps of Madness?,"This book has a promising start and premise, sort of like A. Conan Doyle's ""Lost World"" imposed over all Europe instead of a mere South American plateau. However, later in the book I was disappointed as aspects that I was enjoying were shoved aside for a storyline a lot like ""At the Mountains of Madness"" by H.P. Lovecraft. There is a little something for fans of Kafka's ""Metamorphosis"". Here there be wogglebugs."
3,Europe has changed...,"In fact, in 1912 it was outright replaced by another Europe. A wild Europe, full of wild plants and animals not of THIS Earth. Many believe it to be a act of divine punishment and others are not so sure, but in the end it will change the future of the Earth. Or is that our past?The book starts out kind of weak to begin with, with three major plot threads. Only one seems to deal with Darwina and that was the reason I wanted to read the book. I am not sure I would compare it to the work of Jules Verne or H.G. Wells, but it does have the feel of a Lovecraft or E.R. Burroughs book. Half way thru the story the author tosses in a dash of Olaf Stapledon. Lifts whole themes right out of _The Star Maker_ which did make it slightly more readable for me.In the end it just got three stars and I don't think I will be looking for this author's other books unless somebody I trust tells me to."
2,"Good Concepts, Bad Fiction","Let it first be said that Wilson's novel does contain a number of interesting concepts (that is why I gave this book two stars instead of one), especially ones pertaining to evolution, as the title obviously suggests. However, overall this book is a good example of stagnant fiction. The plot goes nowhere until probably page 200 in 360 page book. The author seems to be heavily influenced by the ""Highlander."" Moreover, the prose of this book is simply awkward, not to mention a number of anachronisms (the novel is primarily set in the 1910-1920s).It is more like a second rate Western than a science-fiction novel. In fact, the ""science-fiction"" part can be summarized in probably two pages. It is hard not to notice the heavy influence of Stephen King (and I mean the worst parts of Stephen King). Frankly, I am surprised that TOR would publish this nonsense. Overall, a disappointing read--not worth the time or money."
1,Convuluted nonsense,"Fans of author Fred Hoyle will notice startling similarities between Darwinia and Hoyle's classic book, ""October the 1st is Too Late"". Both involve time-shifts that change the earth's surface and mankind's attempts to come to grips with the change. Unfortunately, Wilson isn't as capable a writer as Hoyle. Darwinia is a confused, depressing tale that is difficult to follow and unaccountably convoluted. The plot changes midway through, steering away from Darwinia's ecology into a chaotic tale of aliens, gods, and mankind's future. In writing this book, Wilson should have stuck to the theme of Darwinia and ignored the alien mumbo-jumbo. When I finished the book (with difficulty), I breathed a great sigh of relief."
2,Good start but goes downhill,"This novel did start as a clasic Edgar Rice Burroughs or Jules Verne type novel - as stated on the back cover by the Toronto Globe reviewer. However, that reviewer must not have read past the middle of the book because it then turns into a garbled story-line about the changed continent of Europe is due to a computer virus attempting to rewrite the archieved history of the universe. While interesting to read to its conclusion once started, I would not recommend it to others and won't keep it on my bookshelf."
1,Not too good. Would not re-read.,"The story did not work for me. I could not ""suspend disbelief"" and really accept the fundemental premise of Europe being ""replaced"". The grand scale end-of-time thing seemed mismatched with the exploration story line."
5,Musical Guide to the Blues,"Not for the idle coffee table book devoteee, this volume is a comprehensive encyclopedia of American Blues music and artists from the 1920s+. Packed with factual info on artists, their songs and recordings, backup musicians, publications, and various cross referenced data, this volume is THE source of information on the history of the American Blues music scene. ****"
4,INDEPENDANT BLUES ARTISTS COUNT TOO,"Great book as I picked it up for .25c at the thrift shop.But their concept of what constitutes the blues is all over the map.What ??? No Geof Muldaur ?? No Arlen Roth ??Editors need to spend more time exploring independant label blues as there are many more that I can think of that are not included in this book..and I think it's OBSCENE to have all those pages for those great blues artists, the Rolling Stones, for god sakes ?? If you can stretch the definition of blues that far you might as well incorporate the frickin' Moody Blues(NOT)."
2,By far not the best DAT product,"With the scarcity of DAT prep products you may be tempted to buy this. This book was not very helpful. It basically consists of a few practice questions and a full sample test. It has a fairly decent math review though. This book is out of date (for example it refers to the 1988 and 1993 DAT exams while explaining the perceptual ability) and contains many errors. If you are serious about studying for this test, I would buy TopScorePro DAT review CD-ROM (pretty good) and get the DAT review book from KAPLAN (great!!!)"
4,Use with another source,"I felt this book was excellent in it's preperation for the PAT section, the Quantitative Reasoning section, and also the natural science outlines. Although, I would purchase Barrons preparation for the DAT in addition to this book because it is an excellent guide for the science sections. Study and memorize these two books and your improvement will be great. And dont waste any more money!"
2,There are better ways to prep,"Ok but did not help me all that much. I needed more. In retrospect, the best way to prep for this test is to take the princeton review prep course."
5,Awesome!,"Not only was the shipping super fast but the poster was TOTALLY AWESOME! I bought it for my friend for xmas and she loved it, the poster was like a huge hankerchief. Very impressed! Thanx :)"
2,naked crazy people...ok.....,"I enjoyed David Robbins Spectre so when I saw his name again at a used bookstore I picked this up on a blind buy. While its entertaining enough to keep you reading from cover to cover its nothing special. Yet another egyptian horror story with no mummies in it (i like mummies so it annoys me when there aren't any in stories like this). No this is about a curse/virus thats unleashed from a tomb that infects the whole world and makes people go crazy, rip off there clothes, jump down on all fours and eat each other. Maybe I've read to many end of the world zombie stories but this just felt really tired to me. And I like monsters, not crazy people so that turned me off here too. You might not hate it but it deffinatly had a been there done that feel for me, which usually I can deal with if the monster is interesting enough which it just isn't here. Kind of a boring story."
5,Good toy for everyone,"I knew this game at a friend's house and love it even I was 30 already at that time. I bought several when I went back to visit my family and they all love it. When I told my mom that I would give my brother's 1st grad boy a set, she told me he won't like it since he doesn't like the brain games. But he loves it soon after my sister explain to him the rules and he enjoys to do it. My little one, almost 23 months old now, likes those animals and loves to put all of those animals to the board one by one and kind of learn the size and arrange the place. It's not only for 8 and up."
4,nice belt,This is a very good sanding belt . they last long and cleanup good with a rubber belt cleaner.
4,"Lots of ""Pop""","We ordered the software so we could add more ""pop"" and visual variety to our displays of information. The package meets all expectations in that area, and we can configure displays in new, creative ways now... The only difficulty we had was that the package is not intuitive to a new, unexperienced User -- so, we spent 2-3 weeks trying to navigate and learn how data is linked to Excel and how to build and format screens/displays. But, as I said, the package is a great one, with lots of flexibility!!"
4,"great product, horrible support","I bought this product and downloaded it direct for Business Objects, then paid big bucks for the back up disk. The back up disk comes without the key, so you have to keep that handy. As another reviewer noted, there is no backward compatibility. I purchased the product before SAP bought business objects. I had problems moving my license to a new computer even with the backup disk. Don't expect help or sympathy from SAP.Oh. It's a great product. It helped me get promotions and a new job."
4,"Sorry, Bob! Those 2007 remasters are much too loud!","Don't throw your money away on those 2007 Japanese remasters! They're loud, they're clipped! The U.K. pressings suffer from using sources too far removed from the now-deteriorated two-track master. The original 1995 pressing sounds great, is relatively easy to find and at this late date, isn't likely to be surpassed with yet-another remastering. Same applies to 'Pandemonium Shadow Show.'"
1,"no tools, just description of one company's program","If you are browsing this subject, you probably have already decided that ""improving the communication skills of your...people"" is important. Now you are looking for information about how to go about doing that. Keep looking, this article has little such information. It is a review of one organization's process for going about setting up a program. It is presented as motivation for the rest of us to set up a program to do the same thing. Well, thanks, but I am already plenty motivated. It isn't the author's fault. The article is well-written enough and the title is not intentionally misleading. Just realize that there is no useful content for someone looking for tools and techniques for improving the communication skills of employees. That's what I was looking for, and I wasted my money."
1,Poor Vince Foster!,"I bet if he were alive he'd have a few comments about this book! Oh, maybe that's why he's not alive..."
1,Clinton Fundraiser,"Just like Bill Clinton...no substance, no meaning, little truth and no integrity. But jam packed with ego and self importance. Save your money...buy anything else."
1,A 13 year old,"Bill Clinton is a disgrace to this country. He is a true liar and a cheat, He is trying to sell you 900 pages of pure **** and if you want to hear about his sexual ""experiances"" with monica then you are some kind of pervert.You people are influenced by bias media coverage. If you really want to know what's going on I recomend that you whatch FOX news and listin to Sean Hannity. I know that most liberals think that those programs are extreemely right wing, but really FOX does try to be ballenced and Hannity will really tell you what is going on in America. The thing is all the other media coverage(internet,television,newspaper) is all distorted by left wing spin. Please just listin to Sean Hannity on the radio once and I totally assure you that you will not regret it."
1,"Rapist and serial sexual predator Clinton dials in with BORING, vapid, worthless book","This is an extremely boring book. It was written off his daytimer and you can tell the rapist and serial sexual predator Bill Clinton left out all the revealing anecdotes about him.Such as his vicious 1978 rape of Juanita Broaddrick.Or his 1980's gargantuan drug smuggling with the CIA, Bushes and Oliver North.Or the time he exposed himself to Paula Jones (1991) who to this day he says he has never met (liar).Or his hard pass at Kathleen Willey (fall 1993).Or the fact that he and Hillary were going to destroy Monica Lewinsky ... until his DNA showed up on her blue dress.Bottom line - this is just a boring book written off a daytimer. Pathetic."
1,"Some chapters Bill ""forgot"" (cough) to add...","Bill Clinton's memoirs at over 900 pages is a bit too long and tedious. I was however suprised to learn some facts about Clinton's early life including his father's death. Although, sad to say the apple does not fall far from the tree and I enjoyed the pictures. That said I feel Mr. Clinton book (maybe because it was too long??) decided to ""eliminate""(cough) some chapters including...The ""missing"" ChaptersOsama Bin Who?Vince Foster: He REALLY was depressed!To ""is"" or ""is"" NOT ...that is the questionWhitewater: How to make millions in Real Estate10 Ways to a Happy MarriageNow,Where did those REALLY IMPORTANT documents go??Creative Lying ..oh ..mmm ..uh I mean WritingLook at me!

4,At least he told us his side of the stories!,"Does anyone out there really think that being President of the U.S. is an easy job? How do you think your life would stand up to the public scrutiny? Is anyone ""squeaky clean"" anymore? (Although I DO believe that Jimmy Carter was an HONEST man!) This book was entertaining and informative. For the first time ever, . .we have the other side of the stories and for all generations to come,. . .BOTH sides of the story will be in writing. Wouldn't it be great to have a book like this by JFK? Or Lincoln?"
2,What a Joke!,"Wow! After wading through this self-absorbed book it is evident to me that Bill Clinton is the perfect poster boy of a narcissist. He continues his tiresome theme of ""Look at me, I've made mistakes but none have been my fault. It is frightening that this intelligent, but deeply disturbed man was the leader of the free world for eight years. if Bill Clinton had been doing his job 9/11 would never happened."
1,Clinton's Stanger than Science Life Story,"This is a really good read if you are into denial and spin. ""Slick Willie"" rides again with a paint job of what happened during his life. Hmmmmmm...maybe a more appropriate title should have been, ""Sex, Lies and Betrayal of Public Trust"".Glad the copy I read was given to me...I will most certainly pass it on."
2,Bill Clinton's Book,"I was eager to read mr.Clinton's Book,but just as I suspected,it's too much about politics. He repeats himself too much to write more pages. It is 600 Pages too long!!!!!I was disapointed that he still blames Starr,and says how it cost our country 40 million for Starr's report on his personal life.Mr. Clinton,When you became President,your personal life was no longer Personal! And with a Law Degree,shouldn't you have known that? Sir,it was your fault. I did enjoy his childhood memories.He has a talent for making people like him,and I do. Would I want him again for President? NO !I just wish he would take responcibility for his own actions,and stop thinking others are to blame.maybe then he can find peace with God, and become the man that God wants His Children to be.it seems he did more traveling than attending classes in College,but he picked smart friends and copied their notes!! oh yes,and he gave them Government Jobs!! The Book is MUCH too long!! Thanks"
1,Totally Clinton for many many pages.,"This is like a performance review where the boss gives her employee all ""satisfactory"" ratings and the employee spends way too much time trying to talk the boss into ""an excellent"". Clinton blames all the other actors for his failings, takes credit for all his coworkers success. He's a great salesman though, constantly changing the view. Spend some time with your family and leave this paper weight on the shelf."
2,Snoozer?,"Granted, I usually read before bed.... but I've had a really hard time getting past the first 75 pages of the book and I'm giving up. I find myself out like a light after a couple of pages. All of the name dropping!!!! Who they were - what relative or friend - and what they did for him and what they ate and where they lived and ...the list goes on and on and on - it makes my head spin. To be fair, I don't know what I was looking for in reading this book. He's not an author and this *is* HIS autobiography. Just not my cup of tea."
3,"interesting, but bland considering","It was interesting-- it has been an interesting life for former president Clinton-- but not entertaining. The writing was bland. I found myself wading through the book except for a few parts, finishing and reading because of responsibility and the feeling I should, than actually wanting to.Disappointed me, since, though I don't agree with all his politics, I think Clinton was a good president, and certainly an extremely charismatic man. The charisma does not show through in his book."
2,"Way, way, way too much information","I listened to this, unabridged, on audio CD. 42 CDs. I thought I'd never finish. Clinton painstakingly recounts every single event in his life and describes everyone he's ever met. It's too much information.This book could have been so much better if he focused on just the highlights and didn't try to provide an entire history of the world from the time he was born until the end of his presidency.As much as I respect Bill Clinton for his accomplishments as president, I'm giving the book 2 stars because it's overkill.Unless you have a lot of time on your hands, get the abridged version."
1,Tiresome recap of an exhaustive list of life events,"President Clinton's autobiography reads as a near endless series of events rehashed from his diaries. It frequently appears as though the brief, daily notes and events were simply written into complete sentences with some emotion or perspective added. It does provide an extensive recap of President Clinton's life events, so if that's of interest you may want to check it out."
3,An interesting life,"Since there are already 700 reviews, I'll keep mine short ;)My life talks about the life of Bill Clinton, one of the more outspoken US presidents. As expected, it starts when he was born. The earlier years are gone over quite quickly and most of the book is about his time as president.I've enjoyed ""my life"". Most of the things in the book are already public information and therefore I felt that the book didn't give me the extra insight and info that I was expecting. When you've followed Bill Clinton a little, then you'll find it a good summary of the info you already knew :)One addition. The book does have a strong anti-republican political message. I do not mind it at all, but sometimes it felt more like a democratic attempt making republicans look bad than a biography. I do not know whether that was intended.Worth reading, nothing shockingly new though."
3,A superficial look at Bill,"Bill is very protective of his real self. He lives and breathes politics. There are several nostalgic stories in the book as one who has lived during this time I can relate to. Too much detail about political events. Most of the book is about his political experiences, not his personal life. Not the real Bill Clinton. As a result, very boring in many places. Lists of names and dates and events. I am still not finished with the book. I do not like not finishing a book but I will have to force myself to pick this one up again."
3,Interesting Story - Way Too Long,"The story of Bill Clinton's life spends a great deal of time on his youth and early adulthood. While it is somewhat interesting, it seems to take up more than half of the book and I expected the majority of the book to discuss his time as president. I enjoyed the book and found his version of his life to be interesting and contained some perspectives I had not thought of previously. Overall it was an interesting read, but there was too much content focused on his early life and naming people who had helped him."
2,Dull and Boring,"I was expecting to read an interesting story from this charasmatic man,but to my surprise it was hopelessly boring.I gave the book away.Great disapointment."
5,One of the best audio books ever . . .,"No wonder William Jefferson Clinton was a two-term president. In his book, MY LIFE, Clinton proves himself a spell-binding storyteller whose love of the spotlight, combined with great political instincts, propelled AND has kept him in the national spotlight for so long.Early on, it's obvious that Clinton is an intellectual heavyweight with enough southern charm and charisma to make the combination almost lethal to anyone who ran against him.It's rare that someone this bright and insightful enters politics . . .and even with his self-confessed shortcomings and many lapses in judgment regarding his personal life, I have no doubt that this country was in good hands during Clinton's two terms.No matter what your politics or personal feelings about one of the most polarizing figures of recent times, after listening to MY LIFE, you cannot help but admit that the man is a master of the game called politics and we'll not see his like again soon.Enjoy!"
1,Boring,YAWN! Nothing new and no personal responsiblity. The man is the ultimate narcissistDon't waste your money.
4,Not Bad,"I am not particularly a fan of politically based biographies/autobiographies, but I was interested in understanding Bill Clinton's take on Bill Clinton.Approximately the first half of My Life is very interesting. It details President Clinton's boyhood and his journey into politics.The second half of the book is more difficult to read. It reminded me of the sections in the Bible with all the ""begats"". I imagine that President Clinton wrote the last part of the book directly from his journal notes. This section of the book would probably be very interesting to political and history buffs, however.My Life was very easy to read initially, but took perseverance to finish. You will definitely feel a sense of accomplishment when you DO finish reading this book."
3,Hurm.. as books go...,"average. Interesting? Yes. Informative? Yes. A window into one of the most influential people in our modern age? Absolutely.Rather poorly written. Most definitely. If you can take the almost constant run-on sentences which provide far more detail than most readers can retain, read on. If not, skip it. Bill Clinton was the President of the United States. He was a pretty good president. He also forged the way for an incredible descent into relative morality. Want to know more about him while compromising your reading standards? Read on. If not, skip it."
1,"self-indulgent, petulant tripe","Clinton's magnum opus is a grant testament to a life spent in the pursuit of power. It lacks even the barest hint of self-evaluation or honest soul-searching. Clinton accepts responsibility for nothing. Every mistake he has ever made- political, personal, sexual- he blames on some other person, entity or phenomenon. His continued attacks on Ken Starr and his whining about his failure to secure peace in the Middle East (a failure brought on as a direct result of his pandering to Arafat) are pathetic. Readers who are hoping for an genuine look into this man's inner state are bound to be disappointed- either he wrote most of this fluff for filler or his life really is as shallow as some of his critics allege."
1,BORING!!! Including the discussion about Monica,"Book is very dry and long winded. You don't gain any more insight about the man than you already know. You learn more by tuning into the interviews on TV. Even the discussion about Monica doesn't tell you much and if you were hoping for something juicy you are better off picking up a Harlequin Romance novel. I love biographies, especially about presidents. This is absolutely the most BORING biography I have ever picked up."
2,"Long on words, short on information","How can someone who has been President for 8 years have so little information to share with the public. President Clinton is far more concerned with public image and spin then actually sharing insights with the reader. I was not expecting blow by blow accounts, but lets face, everyone really wants to hear his side. He had his chance, and he is still playing lawyer.He should have waited 10 years to write this book. Maybe he would have been more honest with himself and the reader. Both Nixon and Reagan brought you into the oval office with thier biogs. Clinton does not even invite you into the white house with this boring tome.Avoid this book, hopefully he will write another book, and actually share some insight."
5,A president for true Americans,"Once the partisan emotions subside, it is clear that historians will rate Clinton as one of America's most capable and responsible leaders. A true uniter, whose primary concern was the country, rather than the welfare of cronies, he brought America back to fiscal health, and moved society toward greater equality and progressiveness.Clinton reminds us that there remains much promise for America, despite the sad actions of Administrations who debase the Office by using profanity and other childish behavior in public discourse. For all his faults, Clinton had greater integrity than his successor by a factor of 20."
3,"great polotician, very Bad Boy","Bill Clinton, is a master politician, but with undeveloped moral standards.I've always loved Mr. Cliton, and like with most people I meet for the first time, the first time I herd his voice I knew he not only would be elected President, but he would be one of the greatest.I knew he had sex with Flowers, and Monica, from the way in which he denied it- all men know how men operate.He is charming, and speak to people, something other politicians need to learn how to do.his book disopointed me, like most Biographes, they fail to give me the goods, the man- what makes him tick. (side note: that's why reality TV is so popular, is because people like to watch each other)other than that, MY life is a sanitized, good Bio.Look out for the ""Buy on get on Free Offer"" in 2008, Mandan President Hilery Clinton."
1,"Too Little, Too Late","Poor Bill. He lives the life of a tarnished living legend. In My Life, he makes a desperate and futile attempt to clear his name, but merely make half-hearted apologies and continues blaming the vast ""Right Wing Conspiracy"" for his self-inflicted troubles. Not only does he offer no new information about the issues of his presidency to influence the reader, but the great communicator that he is ends up putting us to sleep through a chronological laundry list of unimpressive people he knew over 40 years. I feel his pain."
2,"Lies, Lies and Damn Lies!","I like Bill Clinton. He balanced the nation's budget, and thereby released the economy for an amazingly successful run. But Bill Clinton is an incurable liar. It's the basis for his success. The book is full of lies, and partial truths that are worse than lies. He should think out his experiences for twenty years, and then write a memoir worthy of a U.S. President."
1,A Tribute to a pathetic life.,"The only thing I can say is that it absolutely amazes me is how there are so many major events he could neither remember or comprehend while under oath, yet he has such an amazing knack for remembering the massive amounts of details concerning trivial B/S needed to fill 900 pages. Seriously, how can anyone other than those Clinton lovers which drink the poisoned cool-aid as they did in Jonestown ever begin to believe a single word from this pathetic excuse for a human being. As for me, if the former president told me it was 12:00 noon I would open to t door to see it there was light outside. I borrowed this massive compilation of wasted paper simply because I refused to support him by purchasing one."
1,Oops ... somebody's pants are on fire!,"Oh, so Ken Starr and the Republicans forced Monica to be a whore so that Bill could save the constitution ... uh? All the twisted reasonings aside, notice how the trivial things fill the pages of this book and how very little substance comes out. This volume is a testimony to a trivial life. Oh that those pesky environmentalist don't spike the forest trees that printing this man's excremtent kills."
1,Give me a break!,"If it wasn't for the scandals in the White House created by both Slick Willy and the Wicked Witch, they wouldn't have diddly to write about. The lies in both these books is about par for them. No way can I begin to imagine Slick Willy sleeping on the couch for two months after his heartbreaking confession to Hilly about Monica. Billy Boy used every bed in the place for everything else, why not sleep in one! Just like Hilly stating that they ate leftovers in the private residence that she herself had cooked. Who the hell do they think they're kidding....oh yeah, the liberal left. This book should definitely be found in fine bookstores under the pure fantasy section!"
1,A liar defends himself,"This is a brilliant book about a huge liar.Bill is a liar. What else more is there to say.Clinton is consumed by his own ego and hubris. He can't ever admit he is wrong. He always has an excuse and reason for his immoral ways.If you must read this book, borrow it from a friend, buy is used, or get it from the library. Why pay for it and have the liar get your money."
4,Excellent Reading,"Even though it starts out slowly. This was perhaps the most informative book that I have read since Dallek's JFK biography. With astounding recall, Bill Clinton recounts his hardscrabble childhood (much different from George W and Al Gore's privilidged upbringing), his school life both at home and in England, his rise to through State government and finally his presidency. He does not point any fingers at his staff and speaks very well of his love for Hilary and Chelsea. Even his political enemies are written in a very understanding manor.What I like the best about his book is that he does not talk down to the reader. He comes across as a man who could be your friend as well as your President."
2,Bill still cannot be straightforward....,"I loved Bill as a President, however the book was a long-winded version of his life in which he kissed the booty of almost everyone he seemed to meet or work with over his entire life. He did not give a candid report of his many indiscretions...the reader was forced to read between the lines. The book lacked interesting stories, humor, and most of all...honesty."
1,Kakutani sums it up,"Times lead book reviewer Michiko Kakutani has been harsh on conservative books and Clinton-bashing tomes in the past, but no one can accuse her of going soft on Clinton's new autobiography, ""My Life."" The Times, to its credit, puts her scathing review on Sunday's front page, giving it the same play as the paper's previous Clinton coverage (except for Clinton's confession on Monica Lewinsky, which it relegated to the back pages).Kakutani writes: ""The book, which weighs in at more than 950 pages, is sloppy, self-indulgent and often eye-crossingly dull--the sound of one man prattling away, not for the reader, but for himself and some distant recording angel of history."""
5,I Liked it,"Bill Clinton may have made a few mistakes...but hay, who has not. I liked Bill before the book, and I like him better now that I have read it.People may still be sore about the Monica bit, but that is the past and it was just one PERSONAL matter. As a President he beats the crap outta Bush (heck a slug beats him as a Prez).This is easy and informative reading. It shows Mr. Clinton's humor and easy going personality. I think he will be one of our greatest Presidents when history is written years from now."
2,Not Great,I was actually a fan of Bill Clinton before reading this book. I couldn't even finish it because it was exhausting. He spends so much time patting himself on the back for the good that he has done that he forgets to go into detail on his mistakes.
4,Hate The Man...Not The Book,"There are a lot of people out there who loathe Bill Clinton. So much so that he could have written the Bible and he'd be accused to crafting a slipshod work of fiction.""My Life"" may not be the greatest story ever told, but it is a fascinating look at former President Bill Clinton and the way he sees his legacy.Critics have complained the book is nothing but a way for him to spin the story of his life his way. Which, by the way, is the same criticism that could be leveled at anyone who attempts to write their own biography.The book ""My Life,"" like the story it tells, is full of flaws and contradictions and frustrations. But that what makes it so compelling. Clinton, like Richard Nixon, was a gifted President who was ultimately overwhelmed by his personal demons.Buy the book and decide for yourself."
2,Perfect reflection of the man...,"I just slogged through this surprisingly boring look into the psyche of our 42nd President (whom I twice voted for).Unless you are a wealthy partisan democrat - please save your money. The book is an excellent reminder of Clinton's superb ability to shift, deflect, and/or mislead. I always thought those qualities helped make him the most effective politician I'd seen in years.As far as his impeachable offenses (lying under oath, obstructing justice) Clinton does not take responsibility for any of those transgressions. Apparently he was just trying to save the ""office"" as well as fighting Ken Starr, Newt Gingrich, and ""demons.""The whole text (and there's lots of it) seemed rushed, awkward, and sophomoric. Again, a perfect reflection of a self-obsessed narcissist consumed by his own glibness. I found the whole read mostly pathetic (although I love his hair).Caveat Emptor."
3,"Good, But Not Great","I liked the book, but it lacked the true grit that I think we're all looking for. It does nothing more than revisit the news headlines from the time like a bad rerun TV show. I was disappointed, to say the least, because I saw this as nothing more than a thinly veiled and hollow excuse to simply write a book and capitalize on one's fame before his star truly fades from the public conscious. I read a much better book about sex, lies, and foul play called Cut Throat Business: I am having the last word. This was a much more interesting and revealing read and I heartily reccomend it to anyone who is even thinking about buying Bill's book. Thank you and choose well!"
1,Bill Clinton-- THE MAN WHO SHOT LIBERTY VALENCE Revisited,"I had never known that Mr Clinton was a John Wayne fan, but that is the only explanation for the contents of this so-called biography . The quote from the above mentioned John Wayne/James Stewart classic sums this book up perfectly: ""When the truth contradicts the legend, PRINT THE LEGEND"" and Bill Clinton is, undoubtedly a legend in his own mind. This should be considered a work of fiction, and a poorly written one at that. Any similarity to the actual events surrounding the Clinton years in the White House are strictly co-incidental. (...) The only questions left are, what will he get for the movie rights, and can he get Mel Gibson or Tom Cruise to play the part? This should have been written on newspaper stock, so that it would at least be useful to wrap garbage in. My rating of one star for this piece of pure fiction is only because there are no negative star ratings allowed."
1,Why bother?,"Clinton's 900-plus paeon to himself unfortunately confirms the essay written about him by Paul Johnson in ""Presidential Leadership: Rating the Best and the Worst in the White House"" by Taranto and Leo. Clinton himself, as his entire writing style attests, is a facile, charming, yet ultimately disappointing human being. With all his admitted gifts, he accomplished nothing with his presidency, except for avoiding impeachment -- a victory perhaps, but certainly not a moral one. He left for his successor to deal with the diplomatic and strategic messes his inattention created. Clinton is always the collosal showman; his administration was high theater. The problem, though, with Clinton, as with his book, is: it's just boring. Nothing ever really happens. There's just nothing there.Why bother?"
1,Pants,"This book should be called Me, Me, Me with extra cheese, as demonstrated at the conclusion of chapter 16 when Clinton quotes the Beatles. This doesn't compare to the biographies of Nixon, Reagan or Carter. Overall a massive disappointment and missed opportunity."
1,Bad president/Bad writer,For once the New York Times Book Review got it right: BJ's memoir is 'eye-crossingly' boring.
1,Like the man - overrated,"This book is a clear reflection of the author: long-winded, tedious, sloppy, self-indulgent and dull. It reflects the character of his presidency: high expectations crushed by a lack of discipline, squandered opportunities, lack of focus and scattered concentration. An extremely bright and talented man, Bill Clinton could have (and should have) been one of the greatest men in history. Instead, he has been one of the greatest disappointments. His book is the same. Sadly, he seems to assign more blame for the Monica debacle on Ken Starr than on himself. In fact, he sees that embarrassing episode and his role of dishonesty as a badge of honor! I want my money back."
3,"Bill is a Cool Cat,but nothng new here","Bill Clinton is still One of the coolest Cats on the Planet,but in terms of learning anything new or different it's pretty much the same ole same but with a Bulky Book.the Charm,Persona,vibe is all there but the Book doesn't take you anywhere really different than you have been with Him already."
1,Worst president (good public speaker) who can't write,"Clinton, the worst president of my lifetime, can't seem to fully acknowledge all his mistakes (Black Hawk Down, Rwanda, Haiti, oh yeah Monica). Sadly, he will go down in history as a great president, although he had zero accomplishments. Good public speaker, though, allowed the ignorant to adore him, but he is and was a disgrace to America. Hopefully, we won't see him in the future (with Hilary as president) and he can fade away. So basically, we have a million killed in Rwanda b/c he chose not to intervene, people dead from withdrawing too early in Mogadishu, and cheating on his wife. Yes sir, what a great president indeed! If only there were more like him!"
4,Informative! Not succinct!,"I saw no mention of Paul Tsongas's Peace Corps Volunteer service in Ethiopia. Clinton could have mentioned the importance of Executive Order 11063, but did not."
1,My Life,"Worst book ever written. Sloppy writing, editing, and overall text. He is the worst president we have ever had. The biggest liar and philanderer (aside from Ted Kennedy and his entire family).Keep Bush in office!!!"
3,How does he remember all this stuff?,"""When I was 3, I fell off my bike...blah blah""""Zzzzzzzzzz"" < Me sleepingSeriously, I might as well read some stoner's ""blog."" Clinton is not a good writer. He'll go off on these tangents about falling off his bike, and then in the next paragraph say, ""I graduated from college...blah blah."" (exaggeration, but a good example)It's just a big list of facts with no value. I was like ""Why should I care?"" Why did you fall of your bike? Did it affect your future life?Heres some advice:Cut to the chase. Don't prattle on about useless facts. Get to the point.But you're alot better than Dubya. He's a moron."
2,"Interesting, but not all of it true",Read it but remeber that politics continues on the pages of this book.
3,A Portrait of a Politician,"Like him or not, no one can deny that William Jefferson Clinton is the consummate politician. Once one wades past the Right Wing Conspiracy muck, this book becomes a showcase for Clinton's many positive qualities and points to many of Clinton's accomplishments over a long, political career. You may not care for Clinton as a President, but there is no denying he would be an entertaining dinner guest."
1,This book shuld have been place in the Fiction category.,"It was hard to get through most of this book -- while not only a very boring read, it was filled with inaccuracies and lies -- but I guess that is the sign of the Clinton presidency. He kept with tradition."
1,Just plain poor,"I like Bill Clinton. The book is just awful, though. A pack of lies and excuses. It really lowers my opinion of the man. He is often described as brilliant....and often described as the average man's president. I think the latter is more appropriate because his writing, his thinking and his morals are as average as you can get. Arrogant, yes. Brilliant? Hardly. Funny...Hillary's writings are just as disappointing. You really expect better from these minds, after all the hype. Can't they at least hire brilliant ghost writers? Then again, when Bush writes his story, it probably won't be much better but at least he's likely to exceed expectations since he has some humility: something the Clintons know nothing about."
1,Enough already,Ron Brown's Body by John Cashill is a far more insightful read into Bill Clinton than one will get here. Honest and impeccably researched Cashill's book will rivet you whereas this Clinton self-aggrandizing tome is best read when one is attempting to induce sleep.
1,My Life???,"No one could have possible read all of this drivvel in less than 24 hours and think it is interesting. My day book is more interesting. It is definitely all about HIM! The long, run on sentences are impossible to cipher."
1,Propaganda at its best...or worst,"I thought this book might give me some insight on what its like to be a president. After reading 1/4 of the book I feel betrayed and mislead. It's not accurate and therefore not worth reading unless you want to continue to be lied to. Read between the lines people. Bill Clinton only cares about three things - Bill Clinton, re-writing his legacy, and MONEY!This book has galvanized my opinion of the Clintons forever."
2,Boring Twaddle,The only appeal this book might have is to Clintonistas.As an historical work I don't find a lot of fact.
1,Empty suit,"What more can be said about this person.I choose to view him as a sign of the times; and a sad time it is. Amoral, dishonest, selfish & self-serving. All the qualities that we see in the people held up to us by the media giants as icons. We shouldn't expect anything different from this lump of offal.His presidency should be seen as a watershed: his last day in office was the last day of the slide toward Gomorrah.Don't let this tome be a loadstone to the return to decency."
1,I Love Paula Jones!!!,I would rather read Paula Jones' biography instead of this. She is such a more interesting character. Get writing Paula!
4,My Life: An essential,"My Life is worth reading to any one who is interested in politics, America's political system, or about Bill Clinton's life in general. I believe this book encompasses a theme we all must learn and teach to others: the ability to better one's self through hard-work and dedication. Although this is somewhat overplayed in today's world, it nevertheless is both meaningfull and profoundly powerful if one recognizes it. I strongly recommend this book for the above stated reason, and for the simple fact that he is a marvelous story teller. P.S dont let its size scare you way; you wont regret it!"
5,"Honest, Erudite, and Insightful","President Clinton lays his life out on the table honestly and openly in the way that comes most naturally to him: extremely detailed--perhaps to a fault-- and long. Oh brother, there were times where he was losing me midway through a page, but that's a true indication of what the man is like. Granted, I am an unapologetic, die-hard Clintonite. However, this book transcends politics and has greatly broadened my knowledge of recent American political history. For example, being not even 30 yrs old yet, I wasn't fully aware of all of the events surrounding the DNC here in '68. Clinton's vivid first hand re-telling of that tumultuous summer in my city's history was brilliant. Kudos to President Clinton."
1,Disappointed,"I am a big Clinton fan but this book let me down, big time. Clinton has a shield around the real person and he doesn't let the sheild down for one moment. Everything juicy that he exposes has been exposed in the newspaper and I read it before. Nothing new here. And there are just so many people you can meet and so many places you can go before you just say, ""This book is a bore.""The one thing I got from the book, which I already knew, is that Clinton eats, breathes, and sh*ts politics. Not much on the human side of him is ever revealed. Not one conversation between him and Hillary or Chelsea is ever recalled. A whitewash or expurgated version of I don't know what."
3,Details but no guts,"no introspection such as ""why did I walk away from the bully?, what did that say about me""the man is afraid to reveal too much, wants us to discern his motives,puts on a facade which is typical of children with parents who are addicts.Learned that his life was somewhat priviledged and hedonistic fror his own words.and that he doesn't even ahve insight to his own psyche."
5,Clinton a champion politician!,"I have read this book with immense pleasure...Bill Clinton represents a politician of ""our times"" ever so much.Too bad that George W. will take us back before HIS time!He could have been Prime Minister of Canada for a very long time, as we do not have this two terms affair..."
4,Like reading someone's diary,"Well, this book was interesting. However, it was a grueling read. It felt like I was reading Bill Clinton's diary...that he had kept for his entire life."
5,The Band Boy Meets the President,"I think he is intellectually brilliant and a master politician. I also think, however, he is beset to the extreme with the need to prove to himself that he is superior to the chubby young boy whose mother left him, albeit with his grandmother. It is painful to read about the agony he endured and justified as he grew up (at least in part). His parallel lives are so well described that anyone reading this book should come away with an understanding of this man. I have not finished the book, but I am enjoying every minute I'm spending reading it. What a complex and burdened man he is!"
1,B-O-R-I-N-G!!!,"I bought it, I read it, and I don't reccommend it. A big waste of time! Very disappointed."
1,"Bill Clinton, ""My Lies""","Yes, the title should be ""My Lies"". Here are two people that ""couldn't recall"" and ""couldn't remember"" a thing for eight years and are now writing their memoirs... I think this book is an insult to the american people."
1,Shred of evidence,"How many times does Bill Clinton say ""There's not a shred of evidence"" in this book?"
1,A waste of much paper,"Clinton had better be glad that his pre-release hype was so high, otherwise he would never have sold many copies. This book is ridiculously long, the last half is poorly edited, and much of the time he is doing nothing more than making excuses and passing the buck. I heard earlier today that world leaders like the former prime minister of Israel are publicly refuting ""facts"" from the book. I'm not surprised."
1,Too long and too dull.,"Before I begin, let me say that I don't have a huge grudge against Bill Clinton. I picked up the book at the library because I wanted to learn more about his presidency, and hey, Hillary's book was a good read so maybe this one would be too.WRONG!Bill likes minutiae, and this book is crammed with them. Call me crazy, but I did not need to know the names of every teacher he had in grade school, nor every club he joined in high school, nor every class he took and grade he received at Georgetown. It took him 500 pages to get to 1992 Election! As a result, he had to gloss over a lot of the things that happened while he was President, and that's the part of his life that's most interesting.If you want to read a good book about the Clinton presidency, I'd recommend either Living History by Hillary Clinton or Madame Secretary by Madeline Albright. Skip this one."
2,Disappointing,"Like many others, I've been waiting a long time for ""Bill's Book."" I am a Clinton Democrat, and was a huge fan of the President's, even through his trying times. Clinton is such an eloquent speaker... Why is his writing so pedestrian? Now that I am focused on the tedious writing (he uses 'a lot' a lot & chooses vague verbs ""doing"" and ""making""), I cannot enjoy his narrative. He over-simplifies his emotions (for example, when he relates that a friend of his from Arkansas died in Vietnam, he wrote, ""I was so sad.""). Truthfully, I expected much, much more from this intelligent and interesting past president. I'll finish the book (I am only on page 107), not out of compelling interest in the writing, but out of my own neurosis for finishing books that I start."
3,My life,"I thought this book was interesting and well written but REALLY, REALLY, long. I do believe it could have been told just as well in fewer pages. I also feel that Mr. Clinton was quite selective, spending VERY little time on his failures and a GREAT deal of time on his successes. I am still glad I read it but it took a while to finish."
4,Bill knows lots of people...hundreds.,"And he was careful not to forget and mention EVERY SINGLE DAMN ONE OF THEM in his book!I enjoyed the book. I really did. Bill is a smart guy and its very clear throughout this monster read how he became a president. Not to take a political stance but I can't see George Bush JR writing a biography such as this after he leaves office. Certainly not by himself anyway. Bill Clinton was going to BE somebody. It was his plan. But gawd, stopping every other page to name drop was like halting a TV movie every 5 minutes for a commercial. Like hitting a speed bump on the interstate. It hurt the flow. ""My Life"" was always getting detoured so Bill could give someone a polite mention and a quick associated life story to go with it. Excellent book, lots of interesting stuff and not heavy with politics. Bills not running for anything and that helped make for a great book."
3,Only if you LOVE politics,"You could only really enjoy this book if you are obsessed with politics--that's all he talks about! If you want to know about the man himself, look elsewhere."
3,Not great but worth it,"Not all done with the book and yes he could have used a editor. Who really cares about being governor of Arkansas? But why are people, mostly the one star reviews, writing reviews of a book they did not read? This forum is for people who actually read the book, not people who dislike Clinton and will not read his book under any circumstances and do not want other people to read it as well. It is just plain dishonest to put in a bad review because you do not like the person and did not read the book."
4,Don't believe the haters,"I heard so many people say this book was dull and overly long so I didn't bother reading it until recently. I am very glad that I did. I thought it was downright fascinating. Sure it's long but it's got so many interesting stories in it, even if you aren't a liberal, which I'm not. I'm not a conservative, either. I just thought this was a really fascinating book about a really fascinating person who got to be president of the united states. now i want to read other presidential biographies. I read obama's book, but of course that was written before he was president and was just very different because he is a different person."
3,More than Monica,"Mention Bill Clinton's name in Australia these days and inevitably the topics of Monica or Whitewater will be raised. Few people mention the great amount of progress Clinton achieved during his time as President, and even fewer know of what he achieved as Govenor.""My Life"" is an incredibly interesting read about one man's life. Growing up in an immense time of social change, he pursued a dream to change things for the better. As Governor of Arkansas, he vastly improved the state's economic standing and provided social initiatives to improve the status of its people.As President, it's amazing to learn of the work he did with international leaders. His desire to learn, to understand and to improve, have influenced his life and the lives of those around him.While ""My Life"" won't provide titillation, it does provide a thorough look Clinton's political life, warts and all. Definitely a satistfying book for those interested in politics, history and the state of the world today."
4,Billy Boy done good,"Clinton is a gas. He is maybe the most entertaining president we've ever had. Apart from his sexual indiscretions, he shoots straight. This book is likely to be an asset for John Kerry as he strides towards the White House in November -- no matter what the Ronny Pops Reagan lovers tell you.Good going, Billy Boy -- or Bubba -- or whatever your name is."
1,This book sucks!,"I hate this book! When I bought it I thought that it was a joke. There's nothing funny about it. It really is about Clinton's life. Who even cares!? I, along with everyone else in the world HATE Bill Clinton!!! In the entire book he just makes up good stuff about himself, while in reality there is nothing good to say about him. A truthful book about his life would have been funnier and more entertaining. Do NOT buy this book!!!!!P.S. I only gave it 1 star because I can't give it 0.Feel free to e-mail me at supremeruleroftheearth@yahoo.com"
1,A big sleeper ...,"I really tried to read this one. I'm not a Clinton supporter, but I was interested in his view during his gubernatorial and presidential years. I returned the book when I couldn't get past his childhood. Page after page of VERY EARLY childhood memories that somehow tie into the socialist philosophy he embraces today. All I could do was shake my head - and most of the time it was only to wake myself up."
1,Old Habits Die Hard,More of the same self-serving lies and spin we heard during the eight embarassing years with Clinton in the White House. I regret I wasted the time and money.
1,My Life,"This book was long in the tooth. Nothing new or remotely interesting. Hiliary's book was much more in depth, especially on policy. I was disappointed in this book. Don't pay for it. If you insist on reading it go to the library and get a free copy."
1,"Dodgey, deficient dereliction of democracy","Thank heaven for this rambling nonsense, so that we can now show our levelheaded, young, aspiring writers how not to write. Liberal hack writers, however, will take their cues from their idolatrous fascination with the man, his prowess, and his prose. For imitating his style, they're bound to become ineffective, muddleheaded laughingstocks. Oops, perhaps that's already started. In any case, thank you Mr. Clinton!"
1,Book of Lame Excuses,"I thought my teenage children wrote the book on lame excuses...it seems President Clinton is saying no one ever listened to him and that's the reason for our current problems. I find it hard to believe that the international community ignored the most powerful man in the world, the President of the United States. On another note, it seems no autobiography would be complete without racy parts, but they were pretty lite. The idea that Hillary made the President sleep on the coach for infidelity is laughable: how many bedrooms does the White HOuse have?"
1,More Bill Blah,"Dull and over-rated, this book does not approach being worth the money. It became clear early in Clinton's presidency that to understand him, you pay attention not to any of his words but to his actions and patterns of behavior. Spend your money wisely and buy something else."
1,Total Waste,This is the most self-serving book I've read. It was a waste of money and time. This man is so not be to admired or looked up to in anyway. He made this a private arena for his side of the story and to make people sorry for poor Bill. Don't waste your time or money on this book.
1,Rivisonist History,This book is awful. Bill Clinton is so full of crap. This is the way he dreamed things would have happend not actually how they did. This guy truth if he tried. I think this is the worst Presidential memior i have ever read. I have read past presidents books that have written them.
5,Brilliant Words from a Brilliant Man,"This book offers insight into how former President Clinton came to be the brilliant and profoundly articulate intellectual speaker and political thinker he is today.Anyone who does not like this book is probably looking for something entitled ""Ken Starr's Obsession with Sex Scandals and Tearing Apart America."" This is not that. Thank God! Get over it, (...)!!!"
1,Like The Title,"Like the title of this book, it is rather boring and pretentious. The only interest in this book is salacious: Monica, Monica, Monica! And that he shrugs off as him merely being a bad boy. A man his age, who is also the leader of one of the most important countries in the free world, and he is just a bad boy? Well, he had eight years to make an important contribution to history, a lasting impact on the world. Instead he chose to be a bad boy. Nothing but a huge yawn!!"
2,A big fat bore,"This is the most boring presidential autobiography I've ever come across. It's too careful and so mannered that it's stodgy. One wishes that Clinton had simply fired the ghost writer and written something lively and so what if it showed him warts and all. Instead we get mind numbing details about stuff that doesn't matter now and probably didn't matter then. Do we really need to read about every meal he ever ate? There's no life in this book, no passion, and none of the famous Clinton charm. Reading it made me think of that line from On Golden Pond, ""Bore, bore, bore!"""
1,A study in clinical psychology,"Bill Clinton rivals Richard Nixon as perhaps the most narcissistic, pathologically dishonest president in U.S. history. This book should interest clinical psychologists who also have a fairly detailed knowledge of the history of Clinton's presidency. Ordinary citizens should be aware of the pathology underlying Clinton's version of the facts."
2,"Self-centered, self-absorbed, Unimportant weakling among the presidents","Almost all people have difficulties keeping selfishness and self-centeredness under control. But poor Clinton he really loves himself and always seeks that which is selfish and self-glorifying as his chief end. Plus he was a weak president who desired to secure the civil and social practice of the anti-nomian commitment for autonomous self-regulated infanticide. He will be remembered in the celestial halls of probity and justice as a moral ogre. It is more than difficult to read his notions of government when he failed in personal government, family government and civil government.I recommend that we put this volume down and read something ethically edifying."
1,What a bunch of tripe.,"I only gave it a star because it is a required form field. There are no stars in this book, just a bunch of pathetic losers. I would recommend reading the Bible both before and certainly after reading this painful screed. I was not the least bit surprised that there was no chapter on China, however there is an entire paragraph on astroturf. I would not wish this book on my worst enemy, however, making the prisoners at Gitmo read this might be the perfect torture without leaving any visible evidence. They would however be scarred for life. Please consider donating what you would spend for this ""book"" to your favorite charity ie. PETA ACLU etc. Bill and Hill don't really need the money."
1,BORING,"This is the most self-serving, boring tome I've ever tried to read! Must admit I couldn't finish it. Weren't we led to believe this was to be a tell-all? Was there anything told that we didn't already know? If so, I must have missed it. I suppose I will go back to attempt to find something interesting when I have some serious insomnia. A page or two should be the cure."
4,No separation of Church & State???!!!!,"Umm actually, I have read the Constitution through, having taken AP Govt, and there IS separation of Church and State in the Constitution--it's in a little something called the Bill of Rights, in the First Amendment. Here, I quote: ""Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion""--which means no state-sponsered religion, which means separation of church and state. You can recheck your own copy of the Constitution if you want."
2,A president will colorful life but the content is biased,"This 957 page book introdcued the colorful life of Bill Clinton's . I think he was a great president. He realized the importance of learning from all people, and how a boy challenged his life and finally become the CEO of a nation US.Most of the content is the good thing of this CEO, only little content on the scandal like Whiewater, Monica. If the reader want to know more on this, you will be disappointed.Being the U.S. president at the end of 20th century, he had done some great job, of course, and you can find many achievement mentioned by himself."
1,Get your facts straight: IT WASN'T ABOUT SEX,"He wasn't impeached for his activities with Monica. He was impeached for LYING UNDER OATH. Us commoners in flyover country refer to that as perjury.Debate his merits and faults all you want, but never forget that FACT.Clinton can't erase history no matter how much he spins it...or mo matter how much the pathetic sheep who hang on his every word cling to their idol."
2,Uninteresting,"Again as uninteresting as he was. He calls himself a great president. He was a felon, he lied under oath."
5,Great Book..By a Great President !!!,"This a great Autobiographical insight into one of the Greatest Presidents in History.It makes me real nostaligic for the days when we had a REAL ELECTED president who showed real leadership.its a real inspiration to hear how a Fatherless man made without a silver spoon in his mouth, made it to the top!!This book is a true manual for Success, So of a Modern Day True Horatio Alger"
1,No hope for the book from Hope,"The book is long on meaningless drivel and short on the substance you'd expect from a president who served for two terms.Many of thing s of his presidency he barely mentions while he spends a great deal of time talking about meaningless topics like how he liked math in school and was in the first 8th grade class that got to take it a year early. And how one of his science teachers told the class something they'd always remember: every morning the teacher would look in a the mirror as he shaved and say that he liked himself. Clinton said that thought kept him going in harm times. Sounds to me like Clinton borrowed that line from Al Franken ""Deep Thoughts"" skit on NL.Obviously the book was a collection of meaningless and useless data dump knowing full well he'd be asked to write a book. Paid real well too...."
1,Not worth the millions he was paid,"Dull, boring, and a waste of paper it is printed on. He still doesn't get it, he made bad choices and wants to blame everybody else. He should write fiction, it may make for a better read."
2,Get the audiobook,"If you get the audiobook, you'll get Clinton reading a much condensed version of this, so you won't have to wade through the travelogue and diary-like blandness that envelopes much of this book. You'll also get the raw emotion in his voice when he spits out the sections about Kenneth Starr. And even better, you'll have someone to yell at when you realize how he much he left out to justify his actions. It's interesting that he delves into the Lewinsky saga only at the moment the public found out about it. To have done it chronologically would have spoiled the moment of his ""triumph"" against Gingrich and the Republicans. By doing it this way, he continue to portray himself as more sinned against than sinning, a man who could have led America to the promised land if only those Republicans hadn't been as fascistic as they apparently are. Is it worth reading? Depends on what your definition of ""is"" is."
5,very helpful,Very happy with service. They were very helpful when I needed assitence.I made a mistake with my order and they were quick to help. No questions asked.
2,Tedious and Disappointing,"Clinton is a smart man, but his account is extremely tedious. One also questions the truthfulness of some portions. Only for the most ardent Clinton fans."
1,Self serving and boring,"This is the worst book that I have ever read. Obviously, Bill Clinton is his own best cheerleader. I disagreed with his acts of infidelity and felt that he brought disgrace to the Presidency and to this country, but felt that he was an average President and an intelligent man. Now I feel that he was still an average President but his writings indicate that he is like a high school athlete obsessed and absorbed with his own publicity and in love with himself.Clinton makes Narcissus seem shy. Waste of money. (...)."
1,Boring,I was so disappointed with this book. It will make a great paper weight. With all the things this man did he writes hundreds of pages about his adolesent years. He leaves out everything about Monica and tells a lot of I should have done this. I would not reccomend this book to anyone unless your a die hard fan. Save your money and buy it on Amazon in 3-4 weeks. You'll be able to pick it up for a buck or two! What a let down!
5,Terrific...,"What's disturbing about these reviews is that the 1-star reviews are clearly mostly people that haven't read the book and have no desire to. Since Amazon screens these reviews before posting them, I think it would be more appropriate that they not include reviews that basically say, ""Bill Clinton lied, that's all I need to know"" as they are not reviews of the book. This book is a phenomenal read for people that want to understand the road that can lead to the Presidency of the United States (compared to the ""Daddy brought me"" road of the current clown). Don't get me started on Dubya's lies versus Clinton's, as someone said below, Clinton's tiny transgressions didn't cost anyone their life. But review the book, not just your own view of Clinton that is already established."
5,A Powerful Story,"This is one of the most powerful stories I have ever read. It is compelling, interesting (on many levels), inspiring, quite readable, often fascinating, at times depressing.Politics aside,the story demonstrates how much can be accomplished when a strong intellect combined with a strong work ethic establishes goals,revises them appropriately and works relentlessly toward acheiving them.It inspires one to examine the achievements of one's own careerand to evaluate their contribution."
2,No Doubt Important,"The book, like the man, is no doubt important. Unlike the man, it lacks serious sizzle.Like the man, the book is encyclopedic. Unlike the man, it is extraordinarily dull.Like the man, the book is inclined to be stout. Unlike the man, more is not better.Like the man, there are salacious bits. Unlike the man, they are insufficient to keep one's attention.Serious historians will doubtless pore over every detail. I found my attention wandering early and often. I thought about waiting for the movie, but in an odd way, the presidency itself was the movie."
4,"4.5 stars, actually","History will record that President Clinton was a much better president than his many detractors (at the time) thought he was (i.e. Limbaugh). The economy was booming, no wars, terrorism wasn't a top concern (pre-9/11); sort of like the Ike years of the 1950's. Although one could argue that a good 300 or so pages could have/ should have been eliminated form this lengthy tome, Clinton fans will be rewarded with the sometimes tedious jouney...and any fair-minded person will see that President Clinton deserves a reappraisal as a very good, if flawed, president."
4,A good look at a presidnet,"I thought this book was an excellent, fairly candid, account of the question Clinton supporters and critics have been asking for the last 3 decades: What motivates Bill Clinton? None of the 954 pages of the book puts you on the edge of your seat. But it does offer excellent insight into the motivation of the man and the decision making skills and compromises that formulated his attempts to form a ""more perfect union."""
4,"My Life, excellent reading","I am still reading ""My Life"" and thus far it is a very personal and approachable read. The writing style is excellent and very much like an everyday person speaking about their life. It just so happens that this is the President and the writing style offers a rare look into a very personal place. Good stuff.The hardest critique I have read about it is that it is self indulgent. Its an autobiography . I hope this would lead one to believe that the book might be a bit centered on the subject, which happens to be the author. Go figure."
2,Bill should have just gone to a therapist,"Don't waste your money on this! Just more of Bill trying to make excuses for his negligence in the White House. He had an affair with Monica Lewinsky because ""he could,"" as stated in the book. Meanwhile terrorism was a growing threat to the U.S.Talk about Nero fiddling while Rome burned... no amount of excuses will ever make up for the danger he put us all in."
1,The Buck Stops Over There Someplace,"Anyone who eagerly makes it through this self-directed sympathy card is a lemming who really needs to get a life. As with all things Clintonian, it's full of blame placed on others, egotistical slapping of ones own back, and revisionist history at its' most creative best. No doubt the Oprah crowd will eat it up, but anyone with a brain will develop stomach cramps in short order. Move it to the fiction section with that age old caption ""There's a sucker born every minute""."
1,900+ PAGES ---ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ,"This book has been condensed down to 11 pages on slate.com. Your better off checking that out then reading this self serving tome.History is going to have a ball with this one.Don't expect any straight talk about any important issues hanging over the Clinton presidency, (White water, Vince Foster, his abuse of power)If you have to read wait for a used copy you be glad you did."
1,Awful,"I just finished reading this mind dump. If you are remotely considering buying this crap, don't. It's not worth the reading. I would rather read the dictionary than this garbage."
2,political whitewash,"as expected, like hillary's book, it is an exercise in rewriting history to fit a self-image. Biased, slanted, full of lies this book is useful only for a blind believer or for a look into ""How I want to be remembered, Not as I actually was"". All ""great men"" want to be remembered in the best possible light.If I thought I could walk on water, I guess I would too."
3,Book review or Clinton review,"I have been surprised by the number of people who have been reviewing Bill Clinton, and not his book. One reviewer, who says they were a teacher, kept talking about how they vomited while reading the book book to their students. Then the students vomited, too. I certainly hope this person is never near my children.I added a link to my book store page americanindian.net/clinton.html"
1,Torturous,"Clinton has been repeatedly maligned, but nobody has ever acused him of being a good author. This book is SOOO boring. On and on he writes about so many inconsequential things. The big revelation here is that he really didn't like Ken Starr. Golly, that wasn't a well-kept secret.For 950+ pages he sloshes though stuff only he would care about. For example, his father was an alcoholic. (Bill, get over it.) Apparently he was paid not by the content but by the number of words. This just isn't worth the read."
1,WHAT CAN ONE SAY?,"Bill Clinton's book has zero of a classic biography about it. Here he is more self-absorbed and self-absolving than I remember him, more finger-pointing, infinitely more needy for adulation. The result: an overly long and dull laundry list of the minutiae of his life. Thumbs down."
1,Didn't even make it to the register with this book,I picked up this book in B&N with the intention of a little humorous reading ... and through the process of browsing its pages on my way to the register I was thoroughly disgusted by the level of innacuracy and depth of bordom present on every page ... so much to the extent I put it down in the fiction section (where it belongs) before ever reaching the register. Good luck getting through this one ...
3,sort of drags,"this book sort of drags on and on. read hillary's instead, its better and more concise."
2,Too many uninteresting details!,"I am a fan of Clinton and a registered democrat, so this is not a review from a conservative set out to hate the book. Clinton went into way to much detail on things that seemed insignificant. I also think he is not far enough removed from his Presidency to write objectively about his years in office. I would like to see what he thinks about his time in the White House 10 years from now. He is a great speaker, I just wished he could have captured that charisma on the page."
1,Boring and Dull,This book is poorly written and a outright bore to read. It lacks the detail that you would expect.
1,"Knopf, turn on Text-to-Speech","I bought my mother, going blind, a Kindle so she could still readbooks using text-to-speech. She didn't quite understand the concept but she had a stack ofbooks she wanted it to read to her. I tried to explain. To simplifythings she handed me her hardback copy of Bill Clinton, My Life, andasked, ""can it read this to me?"" I told her it sort of could andquickly bought the kindle version. Imagine how sad my eighty-eightyear old mother was when I had to tell her that it wasn't going toread THIS book to her because the publisher, Knopf, had asked that thetext-to-speech feature of the kindle not be used.Well, she has bought the book twice now and can't read either one.For the blind, turn the Text-to-Speech on Knopf."
4,A Giant Step On The Path Toward National Healing.,"Without delving into the minutiae of this immense autobiography, I would only suggest that the import of the Former President's text lies with the explainations he has provided for every political transgression and scandal; either real, imagined, or otherwise.I rate this book at four stars for Clinton accepting the challenge and providing a running narrative of ""his life"" and without sounding cliche, ""in his own words."" Love him or hate him, Republican or Democrat or any third party in-between, to have a written first-person recorded account offering the ""wherefores"" and the ""whys"" explaining the certain actions he took and the performance of certain deeds he performed, is the first step, I believe, on the path toward national healing from eight years of divisiveness and the fracturing of both major Parties on many issues concerning every citizen. Read the book objectively and make up your own mind in your personal quest for the truth."
3,Not as bad as I thought,"I listened to the audio version. I thought that the book would make me mad a lot, but surprisingly it didn't. I don't believe everything he said but it was interesting to hear his side of the story. I think he talked too much about other things when the book was supposed to be a biography.One major lie he told was about the conservative Republicans. He said they believe in cutting taxes and increasing spending. Conservative Republicans believe in cutting both taxes and spending. Even his buddy JFK believed that."
3,"About average President, below average person","Perhaps the last chapter in this unique individuals life will say that he eventually became a great man. Certaintly history up to now shows Clinton as an about average President, on par with Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter. He created, in his last term a recession that was even worse than the one created by Carter and Clintons personal life would make great material for a soap opera.His book contains a ton of inaccuracies and is self serving (I love me who do you love) Clinton fans will devour this just as O.J. fans devoured his book.3 stars because this profiles one of the most interesting people of the 20th century. But he lost 2 stars for not being truthful and his narcisstic attitude.My question to Bill Clinton is; When will you grow up, start telling the truth and become a real man Bill? Hmmmmmmm?"
1,Dull and shallow,"If, as his admirers say, Clinton is a charming and intelligent person, then none of that charm or intelligent insight is manifested in this book. Mr. Clinton may have been a great president, but a writer he is not."
1,Oh Bill.,"I stopped reading this book after about 100 pages. It was just too too detailed. Really, I didn't need to know every tree species that grew in the garden of his childhood home. He also seems to have mentioned EVERY human he has ever met. And every course he ever took. And every girl he ever kissed (hence the 900 pages ....) Yawn. He should have hired an editor to cut this down by about 50%. Very disappointing. Another door stop for my growing collection."
4,"Long, but very interesting","I finally finished My Life, and while it's very long (the editors could have done a much better job), the book has plenty of good nuggets of information. The book gives a fascinating perspective on the Middle East peace process (he was so close!), Russia post-Communism...and, of course, Lewinsky. It's a very personal account of his fascinating life as one of America's greatest presidents. Especially liked his writings on Hillary and Chelsea. Recommend despite the length."
5,Wonderful!!,"First of all, I wish those of you who have not actually read the book would stop giving reviews. That is not what this process is about. A U.S. president telling his personal insights, recollections and growth through adversity is a great thing. This book does not disappoint in form or style. It is a great read and an intelligent book, not to mention well-written. Thanks Bill!"
3,"This review relates to the ""abridged"" audio version only","I previously bought the book but thought that it would be easier to get through if I listened instead - this freed up a lot more ""reading"" time for me. I was disappointed to find out that they've cut out LARGE sections of the book in the abridging process which makes the ""story"" less interesting and somewhat choppy. At one point, I had to triple-check to see if I put in the wrong tape or somehow missed a section because it jumped from the suicide of Vince Foster immediately to Al Gore breaking a tie vote in the Senate. They kept in all the policy stuff, it seems, but left out more of the personal interest material. Don't expect to hear much of Hillary or Chelsea or personal relationships in the abridged audio versions."
5,Excellent !,"Well presented , concise, objective.An excellent book for those interested inmodern poltical history. A good insight intothe life and acievements of a great political figure of our time."
2,BORING,"Sorry, without being political at all I just thought this book was extremely boring. He spent more time talking about his childhood than he did speaking about some of the major issues during his presidency.Granted, most biographies can also serve as an opportunity to make excuses for past errors but I thought this carried that a bit too far. In addition, I felt he used it as an opportunity to ""settle some old scores."
1,Boring,"900 pages of me, me, me. Perhaps if he realized that the world wasn't just about him he wouldn't have a such a hard time dealing with reality."
3,My Life in Clinton's own view,"I am not a fan of Bill Clinton's politics, but I am a fan of bios and must admit he is an interesting personality. This book is very long and at times overdrawn, but I did get through it. I was less interested in the political Clinton, as someone who sees it through their own lense. I did not expect to agree or particularly like his take on things. He many time lacks self awareness of his own faults. Despite this and because I can be unbiased there is a certain likeability Clinton can have at times. It certainly came in helpful while he was in office. I give him credit for coming from humble beginnings and getting to the top of the political ladder. My question though is at what cost did he do so? I enjoyed the portions of his book that related more to who he was then what he became. It is an interesting read either way"
2,"Is that Bill on Amazon,giving himself 5 stars???","I am being pure and objective in my viewpoint and did read this book. I do give this book 2 stars, merely for effort and imagination to create such fantasy.Firstly, the book is way tooo long and basically d u l l. Haven't we heard this all before?This time he can elaborate and spin his stories even further out there without the threat of perjury.I believe if Clinton wanted to write a introspective memoir he should have waited much longer then this...and for many, never would have been fine too."
1,My Review,"I pictured Snoopy typing ""it was a dark and stormy night"" after reading the first line of this doorstop. Snoopy would have made a better editor than whoever edited this book. As much as Bill Clinton likes to hear himself talk, he likes long, rambling, comma filled sentences.There's no new insights into the events that took place that has not been covered elsewhere, so if you love him or hate him, this book will not change your opinion of him.Any good sophomore english teacher would say this book is too long, the sentences are too rambling and he needs to stay more focused on his subject."
3,Great read,"Bill clinton is truly a man worthy of admiration, and this book is no different. I especially like the part about his chuchu train when he was a boy back in Arkansas. Enjoy !"
3,Where in Heck Is Buddy???,"I have a gimpy bulldog. His name is Colonel. He was friends with Buddy a long long time ago. Buddy is gone. This book does not address the disappearance of Buddy. And that is shameful. Overall, I was mostly disappointed with this story, but I did enjoy the sordid details of a bold man going boldly wrong with a bold woman and a desk-hugging concubine during duty hours. I look forward to the sequel and would like very much to hear what really happened to the Colonel's good friend and confidante, Buddy."
4,Tarzan+Frankenstein=THE MONSTER MEN,"Great pulp fun from the master. Picture Frankenstein mixed with Tarzan...that is the bizarre concoction that is THE MONSTER MEN. The best thing about reading this over most of ERB novels is that you only need to read one and not feel committed to a series. Those who know Tarzan and his Mars series and would rather avoid those because they feel they already know the story but want to try ERB would do well to read this. ERB's style is in as good a form as it is in those series, so go ahead and spend four hours reading this to see what a good pulp really is if you have never tried one!"
2,Only did half of the work.,This drive is a great concept but the one I recieved had a defective media card reader so only the floppy worked which wasn't much help.
2,Something's not quite good,"This was recommended to me by the Amazon ""store"" for buying Masters of Deception. While a few of the ideas were somewhat interesting or clever, the renditions were so poorly done that any potential was lost in mediocrity. After Masters of Deception and seeing actual masters of artististry who also add optical illusion to the mix, this seems like an art school project were the instructor would have given a C for effort and potential. I had to pay for it so I'm a bit more harsh."
1,Not as stable as I'd hoped.,"I found this step too tall to be able to comfortably step onto while carrying items on to my boat. Also, the top is curved, which makes it seem even more unstable."
2,Slow and never got better,I have read other books by this author and enjoyed them even though they are very historically written. The book started slow and never picked up. I had expected better from a book about Isabella.
5,Rave,"Since first reading my neighbor's Eleanor of Aquitaine, I have become an avid fan of Alison Weir. This is exciting and informative and feel much more familiar with jolly old than ever!"
1,Boring,"If you want to read historical fiction that is both accurate and exciting, read anything by Sharon Kay Penman"
4,Well researched biography,"I truly enjoyed this biography on Isabella. The information presented is very well researched and presented. The only criticism I have is that the book is a little dry. At times it feels like a lot of plain information - i.e. on the 16th the court traveled here, on the 19th they traveled there, and on the 21st arrived at their destination. Compared to some of Alison Weir's other books the writing in Isabella isn't as good. However, it is still definetely worth a read."
2,A very thorough biography of the She-Wolf,"Alison Weir has written better biographies than this. Although it is very, very thorough, this same thoroughness makes it quite boring. The author often keeps repeating the same things. For example, the people who supported Isabella are repeated times and times again with long explanations of the reasons why, while they remained mostly the same people with the same motives.Nevertheless, Isabella is a very interesting subject and Weir is convincing in her effort to rehabilitate Isabella from the bad press she has received from male chroniclers through the ages."
4,A Shrew? Or just shrewd? Maybe both!,"Another winner from Weir, this time about England's rapacious Queen Isabella. Although this great, thick read slumps along in the middle, there is a wealth of information, detail and drama about her fascinating life both in and away from court.Weir is especially expert and fairly presenting evidence so that the reader may fairly determine his own opinion about all the startling fact vs. fiction surrounding her legend.Well worth reading for Anglophiles and history buffs!"
4,One for History Buffs,I am enjoying reading this book. It is interesting because of the incredible amount of detail the author has managed to amass. I am amazed that this many records of the Middle Ages exists. :) D. Smith
3,Quen Isabella by Alison Weir,"The book is heavily laced with facts to establish a place in the Medieval World. While the character of the heroine stands out clearly, sometimes the factual context surrounding events is daunting.It's a good read although a little too heavy on historical detail particularly in lists of ""guests"" or of ""persons in attendance."""
5,History that reads like fiction,"It always amazes me that some authors can take a period of history hundreds of years in the past and make it seem almost contemporary. This excellent book recalls the life of Isabella of France, the wife of England's King Edward II. Gleaning material for a life from the fourteenth century is very difficult, but this author has used chronicles from Isabella's time, letters, and other documents to weave a very interesting and riveting tale. She does not accept the chronicles uncritically, however, for she certainly has her own views about Isabella's life, and particularly as to whether or not Edward II was murdered, or escaped from his imprisonment. I was always under the impression that he was murdered, so this book was quite a revelation! It's extremely well-written, and quite a page turner. I highly recommend it!"
4,"Well-researched, readable, but not always convincing","Weir gives a very fair portrayal of Isabella. I appreciated her description of the many years in which Isabella was a tolerant wife with a reputation as a peacemaker, a far cry from her ""She-Wolf"" legacy. She lays out a good case for Isabella having a sharp mind of her own and the will to fight for what's hers, which makes me question the extent to which Weir absolves her from Mortimer's crimes after the couple successfully seizes control of the throne. I never became convinced by her theory that Edward escaped prison and retired peacefully into a hermit's life. Based on Weir's evidence, such an outcome isn't impossible but neither is his death. Certainly, judging from her own description of his personality and behavior before he was deposed, it's hard to imagine him living a quiet and celibate life after his alleged escape."
3,Hard to get through....,"I have read many of Alison Weir's books and love interesting history but this one was hard to get through. Although some parts of Isabella's story are interesting, it just seemed to slog along and I'd go back and forth between this and some other books trying to get through it. Maybe it is just TOO old of history to be fascinating and there weren't any real interesting pictures but just didn't hold my interest like most of her other books do, especially the Henry VIII, Elizabeth, etc. books. But maybe they just had more interesting lives...."
3,Was it murder as reported?,"The judicial murder of royal relatives scars the reputations of several English queens, none more fabulously than Isabella's.How rightfully did Isabella earn her reputation for a murder of stunning cruelty?Weir writes with a somewhat dry, scholarly authority, placing the events in the context of social restlessness, royal finance, continental politics, and extent sources for the sweep of the reign. Weir's reasoning about the personalities involved includes citations of primary sources; the evidence available stretches across the archives of Europe. Speculation about personality is minimal, and founded on known and documented actions.I won't give away her conclusion. I will say that reading this book inspired me to seek out others of the same period. I can't give a higher recommendation than that."
1,Board DOA,Board was doa had to rma to evga I waited over 30 days to try it in my grandsons computer.
5,Very nice,"When I got this i thought that it was gonna be an OK gun with an OK feel, but when I opened it i was VERY surprised. The barrel is very long and it looks awesome. I bought this cause i was looking for a good handgun to match my sniper. I wanted something good a cheap, but this gun is AWESOME and cheap lol. It has a lot more power than i thought and I love the way to load it because the clip has a little lever that lowers the spring so that you can just drop the BB's in. O just to note be careful when cocking it (giggity)because if you get your finger or hand caught in the moving parts your gonna be in for some pain, i got my hand caught in it accidentally and i started to bleed a little tiny bit. Its a little hard to cock but you'll get used to it. Overall this gun greatly passed my expectations and i am very satisfied. If your looking for a good pistol than here it is or if your a Tomb Raider freak it makes the perfect accessory lol."
5,Great gun,"I bought this for my son who loves it! I have three boys who are very rough and tumble with their ""toy weapons"" This one holds up and has a great feel. It was a wonderful buy for the money!"
4,Worth it,"It's a pretty good gun for the money. It is pretty accurate and powerful enough to be worthwhile. The front piece breaks off really easy if you use the silencer, but it doesn't change anything about the performance of the gun. It isn't as powerful as other guns for this money but is definitely a good purchase"
4,"A thorough, revealing overview of the between-war Air Corps.","Dewitt Copp provides us with an in-depth account of the growth of the Air Corps from the era of the Wright brothers to just before the advent of World War II. All the movers and shakers are spotlighted along the way, and the political intrigues they found themselves in are described in detail.As Mr. Copp comes from an older generation, it's easy to forgive his relegation of women to secondary roles, especially since the chauvanism of the time all too often kept them there.I found the book a rewarding read, and would recommend it with enthusiasm to anyone interested in that part of our military history. Because of the scope of the work, the reading at times becomes bogged down in the fine details of events as they transpired. Be prepared to work your way through it"
2,"some unknowns in this kit, no instructions","there were some o-ring seals, which I have no clue why they are there. They don't belong in my engine. If there is a update, would be helpful if Felpro would've included a note. There was the rear intake water outlet gasket missing. I made one from gasket material. There is two square gaskets in picture that don't belong with this engine. They look like two, 2 barrel carburetor gaskets. Am I suppose to use them for my 4 barrel. Stuff like this makes me think that some big wig at Fel-Pro is making some good decisions.The head gaskets, and valve cover gaskets are excellent.The pan gasket is cork, which is out dated design.I bought this kit on a bargain deal."
2,Data Lost Twice; doesn't want it's batteries changed,"I was so happy to see that I wasn't the only person who had problems with this device. I love it's capabilities, but have lost data twice: first time I received a change battery warning, so changed batteries, and zap! everything gone.Contacted Handspring, (what a messy website)and lots of words came back, but were they really listening? Second time, I decided to replace batteries long before they needed it, just in case. Data gone. I did the change very fast, less than a minute as advised. I want a refund/repair or new device, but can't really get through to them. I've cooled down somewhat (they depend on that, I imagine) but surprise! I'm buying a new PDA, and it won't be one of theirs! Here I am, researching other brands."
2,Problems with Palm.,"I have had a Palm Visor for a number of years. I've found it indespensible in the field. You will loose all data, eventually, when the batteries run out. It needs to be backed-up regularly.Watch out! It doesn't run with Vista. It appears neither Palm nor Microsoft cares about this major point."
5,Great way to avoid Win CE Devices,"Normaly I purchase only Win CE (or Pocket PC) devices. I currently use a Pocket PC (replaced my daytimer) and an HP 690 (when I need to compose letters or lengthy e-mail on the move). However, with these devices comes an inherent level of complexity (especially when synching multiple devices) with the actual OS and applications.My wife wanted a handheld device to essentially act as a daytimer. Rather than forcing her into the MS Operating system, and risking the possibility that she may not like the complexity, I managed to convince her that the Palm OS was a better route (simplicity). Ultimately we chose the Visor Deluxe.Installation was incredibly simple. The instructions are easy and to the point. Whats more, she took to the device immediately. In fact, she will not put it down.So, if you are shopping for a gift for someone who may not appreciate the inherent hazards of Win CE devices, go with the Visor. Its the best value for your dollar (the 8mb Version)."
4,Great For First Time User,"Do I spend ... on a new handheld? This was the question that I asked myself before deciding to get this gem. Anyone currently using a handheld will know exactly what they want/need, but it is the new user that does not know where to begin. My reason for buying the Visor: Why buy the most expensive model now when I don't even know how much I am really going to use this thing? So why the Visor over the 2MB Palm? Easy, if I do use this thing a lot I can expand to 10MB for .... Did I make the right choice? Absolutely! This handheld is great! So far, the 2MB is enough, and I use avantgo.com to download 6 internet sites daily to browse on the train in the morning. This is a great first handheld for anyone. 4 stars instead of 5 are for the usb cradle instead of a standard serial cable."
4,Great Product for a Great price,"Been waiting for price to drop on one of these gadget, finally got one. It's a little bulky, wish it was thinner like the Palm Vx, still it does everything I need it to do, from reading my e-mail offline to scheduling appointments. I reason I pick this over a Palm III is that u can add memory to it using springboard modules. 2mb should be enough for the average user, if u don't use avantgo, I do so I got myself an 8mb module, now it's great. I am happy I picked handspring over my palm. oh I forgot USB is great makes Hotsync much faster than serial."
5,The better brain I always wanted,"I used to write about 200 posty-notes a week, with phone numbers, dates, tracking numbers, and reminders. They somehow ALL ENDED UP IN MY POCKET. This is bad news when wash-time comes around. I'm reputable for having the worst long-term memory for non-conceptual data of anyone, and having all my notes turned regularly into a pile of yellow mush doesn't help anyone.So naturally, this thing has been one of my most usefull items. Anybody who fills notebooks with random numbers and then can't remember what the heck they were for needs one of these! It's not very expensive, you can put a couple of games on it, you can upgrade it with those little module thingies, and despite what one of the other reviews have said (about it being cheap plastic), this thing is holding up under some pretty heavy wear without a dint."
4,elegant,"I was reluctant to spend almost 200 bucks on a calendar and address book until I tried the Palm OS on my Mac. It was elegant and easy, so I bought the bottom of the line (2K) Handspring. Now I can't imagine being without it. It handles all my addresses, my rather spare schedule, and gives me John Donne and Emily Dickinson besides (CSpotRun). A very friendly gadget indeed."
1,"The glass broke on mine, too","Beware: The glass is VERY VERY FRAGILE on the Visor.Customer service at Handspring was OK, (they said ""it's like a windshield on a car, sometimes it just breaks)...but I'm shocked I would have to pay $85 to fix a piece of glass that broke while the unit was in my coat pocket. Go to the Handspring web site and you'll see that admit that some units ship with broken glass. If it breaks in shipment I think it wasn't made or packed very well.I might just buy a new one (Palm? something else?) instead of pay the $85, because I'd get another cradle, the software and maybe the newer one's don't break as easily. I've had mine since March and loved it. Now not so sure.If you have a Visor, get a case and be very careful."
4,Why wait for 3Com,"After being on the waiting list at Amazon for 2 months and also shopping elsewhere for the 3Com Palm IIIe, I was plain old fed up! I wasn't willing to spend the extravagant prices for the higher end Palm Pilots (which seem to be the only ones 3Com will produce in abundance!). I ran across the Handspring Visor at Amazon and decided to take a chance. I LOVE IT! After comparing it to a friends Palm III, I don't see a difference worth mentioning here. It is fully compatible with the Palm so why wait! The only small pieve I have is you have to shop at Amazon or Handspring for accessories and/or replacement parts!"
1,Frustrated with delivery,I cannot give a rating of this product as I have yet to receive my Visor. My rating is based only on the customer support!!! I placed my order 2 weeks ago and still have not received my product. I have been told several different stories regarding the delivery date. One would think that they'd at least make notes in their system so that I'm told the same story whenever I call in. I am hoping that this will not be an indication of how my relationship with this company will be in the future.
3,Good but ok,this is a very good device for organization but otherwise it sucks for almost everything else.
2,Visor Leaves Certain Qualities Desirable,"I bought a visor about 2 months ago and loved it at first. As a began to use it though, it got old fast. It made me want color sooo bad and has almost no memory. The graffiti system is easy to learn but gets really annoying when a letter just will not pop up. I am going to sell this pda and get a Casio, HP, or Compaq. I still have not decided. But after owning this pda, I regret buying it and made me want a pocket pc."
2,Poor external design overall,"The plastic on this model is cheap. The snapon lid is clumsy to open and the whole product pops into two pieces, something which is a poor design. Not worth the bucks if you don't have any use for the module expansion slot."
1,Sloppy piece of engineering,"A sloppy piece of engineering- The expansion module cover keeps slipping off, specially if you wear the Visor on a holster - The batteries drain like a leaky tap - The screen corners are poor - I changed the batteries, and lost ALL the data and new applications that I had! - The machine is thick and bulky - looks like it needs to go on a dietNet net: You would be better off with a pen and paper diary than this clunky piece of plastic! Welcome ye pretender!"
4,IMPORTANT need this,"If you are going to get one of the handspring visors, then be sure to get a case for it. If you do not then I promis you that it will get dirty scuzzy and you can never get it clean again, because it sticks between the buttons(where you almost can't clean), your screen (mostly pet hair), and it is hard to clean. Plus it is very easy to damage the screen in your pocket without a carrier along with you, so BEWARE, get a case for it!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Best Bucks You'll Ever Spend!,"I have been using my Visor since December of 1999 and it has been GREAT! Besides the great features for a reasonable price, it has filled a need for me to have updated information with me wherever I go. With this Visor, I keep it synched with both my work and home computers. Before this, I would always be at home - and needing an email address on my work comuter - and vice versa. Plus the hassle and weight of carrying a paper calendar and notebook, from which I had to transfer information by hand every year to a new one. Now I have all my info all the time - and it serves as the ""link"" keeping home and work computers on the same page. I am now so ORGANIZED! <smile>. I did a lot of research and spoke with several ""tech"" friends - who all recommended the Visor over the Palm. I have compared models belonging to friends and firmly believe I have the better PDA - at a better price. Buy it!"
3,if only they would STAY on they would be great.,"I have 2 30 pound dogs. I got the small size based on measurements. Problem is that my hellions appear to have paws like dinner plates and ankles like twigs. I can't get them tight enough around the ankles to get them to stay on reliably. I like them, they work albeit briefly and they are cute when on. I think that if I were to get them again I would disregard paw size and get the extra small. Maybe the ankles are tighter on those? I got them because of street salt in Manhattan, so at least I don't have to worry much about losing them in snow drifts, they just sort of slide off while walking. SO, when purchasing, consider the relationship between legs and paws and maybe buy for leg size."
3,As well as can be expected...,"None of the music contained herein is from the original cast recordings. As far as I can tell these are sung by session musicians and accompanied not by a full orchestra but synth strings and sampled melodies.The renditions range from the inspired (the bits from ""Whistle Down The Wind"", ""Sunset Boulevard"", ""Evita"", ""Joseph & The Amazing Technicolour Dreamcoat"" and ""Starlight Express"") to the insipid (the dreadful renditions of songs from ""Phantom Of The Opera"", ""Jesus Christ Superstar"" and ""Cats"").There are some odd inclusions on this set (""The Mirror"", ""Eternal Youth Is Worth A Little Suffering"", ""The Rap"") as well as some very glaring omissions (where the hell is ""Love Changes Everything"", ""Everything's Alright"", ""Amigos Para Sempre"", ""Pie Jesu"" and ""Unexpected Song""?). Isn't this supposed to be the great music of Andrew Lloyd-Webber?Still, for the Lloyd-Webber fan on a budget this might prove a worthwhile purchase."
3,Be wary if you are an Amazon Prime member it does not ship Prime,"We have yet to receive this item. It was promised to be an Amazon Prime item on the online account. This means that we should have received it in a few days. This item has now been out for over 10 days, and tracking shows it hasn't even left the original state yet (Pennsylvania) and we are in California. Contacting Amazon did no good, as all they did was inform me it had been shipped standard .... I asked for them to try to expedite, but they will not do anything but tell me to wait another 10 days. 20 days is not prime shipment.I can't rate the item I don't have it."
5,Great!,"This is the best, my plants and flowers are huge! Not to mention I can be green and put stuff that are normally tossed to waste back into the earth."
4,Compost tumbler,"I purchased one of these a little over a month ago. It was a little tricky to put together, but I am pleased with it now. It's compact, easy to move and to tumble. Still waiting for the compost...it's hard to get the right mix of browns and greens plus moisture. I'm still learning!"
5,Exactly what I wanted,"This composter is the perfect size for a back porch (hence, it's name) or, in my case, for my courtyard. It fits in a corner and is easy to open, fill, and spin. It's perfect for anyone who wants to compost leftover kitchen veggies/fruits and the occasional bunch of leaves."
4,Good product,"I was concerned about the assembly, based on others' reviews, but it was very easy until the final moment--one of the sides did not have the hole drilled out, so I couldn't insert the screw that holds it onto the stand. Fortunately I own a power drill, so I was able to remedy this, but it did add some time to the process (this is the only reason it got 4 stars instead of 5).Now that it's put together I'm very happy with it. It's sturdy and just the right size for two people. I really like that it's off the ground, as our last composter did not have a bottom, and some small animal excavated underneath it every night--flinging lots of rotting food for our dog to eat!"
5,Compost In Three Weeks!,"Simple design but strongly recommend you read and understand all instructions before starting assembly. Any mistake will affect the success of your compost, which requires the airflow, drainage, tumbling, and door removal design elements all to work together. I have owned other composters in the past which only resulted in aggravation and rats, not compost. So I was ecstatic when my first batch of compost was ready in three weeks (I did add two cups of compost starter initially). Having the composter sit off the ground, allow easy spinning, and wheeled relocation in the garden make all the difference. What a joy to use our discards for putting nutrients back into our organic garden and food."
2,Cheap hardware ... makes it non functional,"I echo a previous reviewer who found the cheap latches a problem. Ditto for the door construction. Mine broke after a few months use. As it is a plastic piece, once it broke it was gone. I had to drill into plastic and add a metal screw which is a poor solution but all I've got to hold the door in place (sort of). The latch doesn't hold well, meaning it's got to have a strap around it. This is a very light use appliance, which if you use it very little, may give you satisfaction."
4,Should be 5 star!,"This composter is my first. It is nice. Very mobile. The locking clasp must have been changed as I read reviews that complained about it. I have no problems with it.The reason I did not give it 5 stars is that the instructions are a little vague and the seams on the drum are not real tight. If you throw saw dust in the bin, you do get some leakage.A huge plus was the customer support I got from the manufacture. Being that I had a little problem with the instructions, I had to take apart the frame because I had it wrong. In doing so, I ruined the end cap that holds the wheel in place. One email to the manufacturer and they responded within a day and sent me a new one at no charge. That, my friends, is customer support.That being said, I love it!Peter in Chicago."
4,Great composter,"This composter was really easy to assemble and fits great in any back yard. The ONLY thing that may be a shortcoming is that it might be a little small for anyone with a fairly large yard/garden that they eant to product compost for. I would recommend this seller as well, as they did a GREAT job of shipping the item quickly - even over the Christmas season we got it in less than 10 days!"
4,Easy to assemble and use,"This is my first experience with composting ever, so I had little idea of what to expect. The tumbler was easy to put together (you needed a little muscle to get the 16 or so screws in).I've only been putting scraps in for a few weeks, but it certainly seems like it's working. I think it will take longer than anticipated for the compost to be ready since I keep adding in and since the pile shrinks so much. Either way, it's compact, tidy and easy to turn."
4,Compost Tumbler 08001,"So far so good, just been using a little over a month. Tumbles easily and good size for just my husband and me. Husband put it together. Don't recall him having any difficulty. I like that it is movable so when ready will just roll over and sift onto garden."
2,Good while it lasted,"The tumbler didn't even last a year before the plastic broke around the metal rod that holds it onto the cart. It wasn't overloaded or abused in any way, the plastic just wasn't strong enough to take the load of compost as it turned around and around.Before it broke it was pretty nice though. I was able to get two loads of compost, from green grass (dried in the sun so it didn't mold first), leaves and kitchen scraps to black gold, before it broke."
2,Disappointed Lid,While a tumbling composter sounds great this design falls short.It simple does not do a good job of turning and mixing the humus. It is occasionally necessary to manual flip the material which is not a huge undertaking but the poor lid design makes it a challenge due to the lack of a lid latch to hold it in place while you mix the humus or remove it.
2,not for serious composter,"I have a small garden and I bought this item because of the perfect size, and beautiful design. I have owned this product for over three years. Two of that years unit didn't fully perform. It's good for small yard and if you don't fill it more than one third. It's easy to assemble, door is sturdy. Problem is when you fill it over half full. It's PLASTIC, and I should of known that. The screws that hold the barrel bent by heaviness of compost, and I would of replace them if the plastic around them didn't tear and now I cant turn it anymore. The other problem is that it takes some time to make compost, so I actually need two composters; one to lay dormant and process food and leaves and another for fresh clippings and scraps. I am planning to purchase steel one with double chamber. Although they are not pretty to see, they last longer than plastic."
2,Over toilet storage,"This piece looked great online and actually looks great in person, but the wood pieces had several nicks all over it and in pretty noticable spots. Will have to touch up with paint. The directions for putting it together were absolutely terrible. Once finally together its not all that sturdy. For the cost there are better ones out there and cheaper."
3,"Fun, But Not Durable","I didn't expect this to last very long in the hands of very active boys, and wasn't wrong about that. But they had a blast with it while it lasted (a couple of 3 days, or so)."
2,Size matters!,"Overall, this is a decent toy. I was just disappointed in the size. It does seem to be very durable and fun. But it's just too small. Make it a slingshot or a bow. This seems to be a pointless concept in my book.On a positive note, it does encourage good coordination and aiming skills as a slingshot.I intended it as a gift for my 4 year old who requested a bow and arrow, but upon opening it, I was too disappointed. We gave it as a gift because this would have been a disappointing finale.Instead, we gave my son a Nerf crossbow. Much larger, yet still appropriate for his size.This is fun for a backpack toy."
2,Should have saved the money,"I got this for two reasons: it was a good Gold Box deal at Christmas time, and I thought my 7 year old daughter might enjoy it since she liked Barbie and the Three Musketeers and so that she could join in with her cousin's play, since he has nerf weaponry galore. In truth, my husband played with it longer than she did on Christmas morning, and I haven't seen it since then."
2,"My 3 boys don't want, don't like","I have three sons ages 11, 8 1/2, and 6 1/2 years old. None of them like this toy. They each got one for Christmas. We have a bunch of other Nerf and other brand toy guns and bow and arrow type toys that they play with. I would not recommend this toy, waste of my money."
1,hobbytron rip off!,They total rip everyone off! Check it out for yourself via the BBB California site!
2,Try Poisonblack Instead,I was lead to this cd for my goth fix. I was disappointed!! The music sounds more like lite rock. Nothing really goth about it except his voice. IMO.Try Poisonblack instead. Same lead singer but heavier more atmospheric goth tone.
4,a decent book,"A fine book for those who are real strong in algebra. At the risk of appearing sexist, it is definitely written from an female academic's point of view. Some real-world examples would be helpful. Overall, a decent book."
3,Not what I expected,"More of a showcase of Mr Gross' talents. Not really presented in an organized, visually helpful manner for me. He's an awesome bassist, but I need a more structured set of lessons."
5,Great!,"Another awesome album from the guys. Awesome CD, and well worth the money. This album also features the song of the same name which is probably their most famous song of all 'Basics of Life'."
4,Still Good,"I originally purchased this album after I really got serious about my faith in the early 90's. I used to work out to this ""tape"" during the first war in Iraq so this was a nostalgic purchase for me as I have no idea where the original went. I am some what biased concerning this album but as top 40, and obviously produced as such, but the songs are still good. I still love the music."
2,disappointing,"I purchased this particular video because the titled and cover image suggests musical selections that celebrate Tin Tan's best character, the Pachuco or Zoot Suiter. It was so disappointing to find there were no songs form any of his films as a Pachuco character. In fact they are some of the least interesting musical numbers. You also have to skip through like a dozen commercial ads for cheap Mexican telenovelas and b-rated movies. There is no option to get to the main menu without doing this, so it it quite annoying. Then you do get 4 entire films, but again none of them feature the Pachuco character. I think the product is misleading."
4,Great book for gaining insight,"I bought this book as part of an online class. The class guided participants through the book. This book provided valuable insight on traits and characteristics that I have and the types of careers I am best suited for. As part of the book, the reader does a Myers-Briggs test to determine their personality type. I have done Myers-Briggs testing in the past but never with the explanation about each type that this book provides. The book provides an write-up about each type - allowing those of us who cross types to hone into the exact type we are. Based on this, the reader can then read the career section devoted to their type. I found out that I am in the right career - however I am not using my strengths and preferences correctly.This book provides great insight...I recommend it to anyone trying to determine their entry-level career or for those of us facing 'mid life' career dilemmas."
3,Meyer-Briggs and little more,"A book that describes the MBTI types, and from that tries to be a career counsellor. I've read worse books, but you would probably not miss much by skipping it.If you are interested in a cursory overview of the MBTI types, it is OK."
2,"UNDERSTAND THE NEEDS OF OTHERS, YOUR EMPLOYER",Imagine yourself already in the job. Talk about your accomplishments and what you can offer your employer. ........... . ................ ............... ............... ...........
3,rehashing what many of us already know,"Those of a certain type-say, ENFP will enjoy, but not really get anyhting new out of this book. If you don't know what an ENFP is, than this book may be for you."
5,Helped me find my way!,"This book was recommended to me by a resume writer and job coach ([...]). I was floundering trying to ""figure out what I should be"". Gail recommended several books to read, and I got this out of the library. Well, Iliked it and bought my own copy. It gave me a better understanding of myself and why I am in the career I have chosen. I also understand co-workers and my boss better now too. A good read!"
5,Great roadmap and reference,"I originally checked this book out of the library. Even though I finished reading it, I found it so useful that I bought it for my reference library. It's one of the best guides I've used for figuring out your Myers-Briggs type, and once you know that, it provides very useful information about the type of work and working conditions that will best suit you. It also provides a roadmap to looking for new work or enhancing your current job, that is tailored to your type. I wish I had read this book when I was in high school and just starting out in the work world!"
5,Excellent book to match your personality type to a career,"Lately, I have been ""searching"" for my work identity and have been involved in a Leadership Development program through work. This book was awesome about affirming who I am and then recommending several careers that would fit my personality type. If you are undecided or feel ""railroaded"" into a career that just doesn't feel right, read this book. Soon I'll be making a significant career change and I give credit to this book."
4,Worth the work,"As an employment readiness facilitator and coach for the last 13 years I've had the opportunity to read and research many books on the subject. I found this book to be worth the time to read and study it. The more you know about yourself the better your career choices will be. This can save you the enormous cost in time, money and energy invested in the wrong career."
5,Book Review for 'Do What You Are',"I bought this for my wife who's a career development training specialist. She loves it and was very excited to add it to her library of career development books. She says it's a very good resource for guiding you to ""live your authentic life."""
4,Directs you to the right path,"My friend and I did the exercise this past weekend. I was skeptical at first, thought it was going to be like a horoscope -""one-size-fits-all."" But my skepticism vanished when I saw the results. We were both amazed at how this book almost accurately summarized both our personalities. And the recommended occupations listed under my personality type were jobs I was already considering or currently doing. If you need guidance as to which profession you should consider, this book is a great starting point. It gives you an idea of what might be best for you. You also get a better understandig of yourself."
2,Not as helpful as I had hoped it would be.,"I read this book, perhaps expecting too much. I thought it might help me choose a career I'd enjoy based on my personality. In the book it had a personality test. I was supposed to find out which personality type I was, but for some reason I had some difficulty at first. They all said about one or two things that sounded like me, but none of the sixteen types were actually like my personality. I have read much better books which have acurately described my personality. When, I finally settled one of the sixteen types, I was disappointed because none of my personal career choices were listed. I think they should have listed more careers. I had a couple of my friends read the book as well and three out of the four of them also had difficulty finding their personality type. Although, some reviewers obviously found it useful, I personally would not recommend this book to anyone."
3,"Pretty good, if you're into personality type","If you've taken Meyers-Briggs, this book can help you understand how your strengths and weaknesses affect your work. The downside: this 386 book will have only a small section (1/16, to be exact) devoted to your personality type. Some of the career advice seemed kind of common sense, like it could apply to anyone. It was definitely an interesting read, but I might try to pick up a used copy instead of buying new."
3,It's so so.,To me without going over the results with a professional you are still in the same boat. The test results fluctuate if you retest depending on what mood you are in. Maybe you may get more out of it than I did. It cannot hurt to try. I certainly liked it much better than the Umbrella books.
5,A handy reference tool for anyone studying the Vietnam War,"I have been teaching a Vietnam War history course for five years and have always wanted to have such a concise, well-conceived, and accurate reference book as the Dictionary of the Vietnam War. Controversy surrounds the war and our involvement--this is not unusual since the Vietnam War was one of the most devastating emotional events in American history. Due to this fact, often times the struggles to deal with the legacies of the war venture off into directions that are not productive and do not promote further understanding and healing. In my opinion, the entries that I checked in this book are well written, informative, and do not convey any particular bias. I will use this book and will recommend it to my students.Dr. Bruce Solheim, Professor of History"
4,Pleasant music but....,"Pleasant music but by ""With Book"" they mean the normal CD cover / insert telling about the musicians and the songs and how to order more CDs. It has 8 ""pages"" in each of 4 languages. I was expecting at least a mini coffee table book telling a little bit about Chinese New Year with the pretty-pictured cover to set out for display, though the listing doesn't clarify. Would still purchase, but I would have been able to plan ahead better had I known this, and now there is not enough time to buy a separate book to have on display. Oh well...."
1,Big mistake,"The product description was 3x but when received the size was ""one size"". The top would fit a 12 year old without a chest. The G string was bigger than the top. Greatly disappointed and would not buy from this line ever again."
5,Top Tipper,This tipper has a great feel and very nice balance. The Tipper was delivered quickly and was exactly as described. Thanks!
3,Walking Through the 23rd Psalm,"From the moment you open this book, you'll walk on a journey with Pastor Tony Evans through the 23rd Psalm. Verse by verse, he outlines the modern application of David's beloved Psalm and clearly defines our role as sheep. He is passionate about affirming that in Our Shepherd, we have more than enough. After reading the book, I saw how the cover beautifully matches the message of the book. My only complaint is that I wish the book was longer in content. I received the eBook version and it was only 50 pages long.Disclosure of Material Connection: I received a complimentary copy of this book from Waterbrook Multnomah as part of their blogger review program. I was not required to write a positive review. The opinions I have expressed are my own. I am disclosing this in accordance with the Federal Trade Commission's 16 CFR, Part 255: ""Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising."""
4,God is More Than Enough book review,God is More Than Enoughby Tony EvansTony Evans has taken Psalm 23 and wrote a short book about it. He really unpacked a lot of stuff that I have never really though about. He really shows you why God is more than enough. I was very skeptical about an entire book being written on the 23rd Psalm but after receiving it and seeing that it was only 70 pages long I was good to go. Tony unpacks the Psalm one verse at a time.It is a very easy read and I would recommend it to others. Most of us have read this passage many times but Tony adds some fresh light to it. It give it 4 out of 5 stars.I was given this book by the publisher to do an honest review.
5,God Can Meet All Your Needs,"Do you ever have days where you're not sure how you can go on? I have more of them than I would like. So when I saw this book, I picked it up...and devoured it that same afternoon.""God Is More Than Enough"" is Tony Evans' walk through Psalm 23. The first sentence of the book immediately tells you what he's focusing on:""There is not a single need you could possibly have that isn't addressed by the words of Psalm 23.""Not one.""Evans than goes through five different categories of needs, spiritual, directional, emotional, physical, and eternal, and breaks out how God promises to meet each of those needs in this psalm.Like the psalm it's taken from, '""God is More Than Enough"" 'is short, simple, but extremely meaningful. This is one of those books I'll be keeping around for a while.I received a copy of this book from Multnomah Books in exchange for an honest review."
5,Surefire Compound Bow hits the mark,"I bought the Surefire Compound Bow for my 6 yr old son for Christmas and he loves it. As a matter of fact, I am going to order another one because his twin sister is always fighting with him to use it. It'll be nice to have an extra one in case friends come over to play. Maybe I can get my chance to test out my archery skills.I definitely recommend this to kids that are six and up. It take a littlestrength to pull back on the bow. So far my little 45 pound daughter set the record for shooting the arrow a good distance of about 25 feet. Hermuch bigger twin brother needs work on the technique.I think that this toy is a great introduction for kids into the sport of archery. Overall this toy is a hit in our house.Monkey Business Surefire Compound Bow"
4,Still popular with my 5 year old son nearly 4 months after Christmas,"Before I purchased this, I was put off and almost didn't buy it because of reviews citing its fragility. My son has played with this one quite a bit since Christmas and hasn't broken it yet.It didn't take him long to master the unique arrow loading procedure and the nerf arrows have taken no toll on my 7 year old daughter, who sometimes is may son's target.I did buy two of them (just in case), but that turned out to be a bonus. My son and daughter square off a few feet from one another and play an bow and arrow version of catch. They retrieve each other's shots and volley them back.Good harmless fun. Just buy a couple extra packs of arrows. These are a tad fragile and the feathers get nicked off fairly easily. Having said that, we still have 3/4 of the original supply of arrows."
3,Bowcefus,Too hard for 7-9 yo to get everything all lined up.Its kinda fun but frustration wins out over fun after a while.
2,Broke third time of use,"This toy broke my 7-year old's heart when it broke the third time he used it. He thought it was great fun, had no trouble using it, but it snapped when he simply pulled it back. Great concept but cheaply made."
1,"Great toy, for the 3 times it worked. . . .","This toy is so cheaply made that it functioned correctly only 3 times before it broke. One of the arrows broke before it was fired. I would advise spending your money on something with a little more durability. The arrow however, did go quite a distance when it did work. . .before the bow broke."
3,arrows are not hearty,Wish arrows were made with as much quality as bow. And only 3 arrows with no way to find replacements make the life expectancy of this toy about 1 week. All arrows are destroyed but bow works just fine.
3,Overpriced,"I purchased this for about $35 thinking it would be some piece of cool mechanical fun. However, it is nothing more than rubber tubing on plastic that bends. Not worth the price I paid for sure. I figured it would be like a real compound bow with spring joints. Nope, the plastic bends. wooop de doo.It does shoot the things pretty far but they just made it look far cooler than it is and charge too much for it in my opinion."
4,Lasts 10 Days With One Cat,"I can be sure my cat is eating all she wants for up to ten days with this feeder. It keeps the food dry and fresh. Simple and much cleaner than a simple bowl. Highly recommended for ease, however, inactive cats might get fat!!!"
5,Go Reds!,This hat was priced low and received quickly. The hat fits great and the quality is good. I would definitely recommend it.
1,Doesn't fit,"I have noticed that while the twins franchise hats fit in my size (small),the newer caps under the corporation name of '47 Twins do not (too large)"
4,IN MY OPPINION,"I HAVE BOUGHT A FEW ITEMS FROM AMAZON.COM IN THE PAST AND I HAVE HAD A PRETTY GOOD EXPERIENCE WITH IT, BUT SOME OF THE ITEMS LIKE THIS ONE DOES'NT GIVE ENOUGH DETAIL ABOUT THE ITEM I THOUGHT THIS WAS A MUSIC VIDEO BUT INSTEAD ITS MORE OF A DOCUMENTORY AND VERY LITTLE MUSIC VIDEOS I BELIEVE AMAZON COULD PUT A LITTLE MORE IMFORMATION ABOUT THE PRODUCTS ON THE SITE."
5,Best Progression Ever,"The change from the previous album is less noticable than the change from Draconian Times to One Second, but there is still a change and a change for the better. Sure, Nick decided to stop screaming entirely, but for any fan who likes Paradise Lost for their melodic qualities, there is no dissapointment whatsoever. The only ones who will cry are those that only liked Paradise Lost because they sounded evil at one point. There is a noticable lack of guitar in this album, but the truth is, I didn't notice until I read some of the previous reviews to this record. I was too busy enjoying how pleasing the music was to even care. I've heard Paradise Lost from their beginnings to the present. They were great then and the quality of the music just gets better and better as the albums progress. Plainly and simply if you liked One Second, you'll love Host."
5,Old Time Westerns with great Heroes,"Sometimes I put one of these DVD's into my player and watch westerns all night long. I never get tired of watching them. Heck I can even do my own reruns better than Cable or Satellite's can do. Thanks for the great selections Amazon, and I already have more set up on my wishlist and will order along. I like everyone of the actors that I have checked below, I think they are all great. One of my all time favorite actors is Audie Murphy, he has always been an idol to me and I feel that he is one of the greatest Heroes that ever lived and I have gotten some of his movies from Amazon. I must have a collection of about 20 to 30 of his movies."
3,Western Lovers,"It was okay, wasn't as good as I thought it would be, but it had a variety of old movies on it."
4,An Intriguing Alternate History of Bowie,"This (now long out-of-print) release acts as an alternative history to ""ChangesOneBowie.""Where ""C1B"" goes through the hits, ""C2B"" includes what could be considered alternative takes on its platter. Fame has its echo in ""Fashion,"" Space Oddity's story is continued in ""Ashes To Ashes,"" Ziggy Stardust's story is reimagined in third person in ""Alladin Sane"" and ""John I'm Only Dancing"" is updated for the disco scene in C2B.While in some ways inferior to C1B (which made plenty of top LP lists over the years as one of the few ""greatest hits"" releases to do so), It has its charms and works as a companion piece to C1B. Get it if you can find it (and C1B as well)."
3,Tapers teetered,"Although I like the design of the holders as well as the pattern, I found that despite using 2 different commercial candle-tack products +/or using different brand tapers did not remedy the problem to which I refer as taper teetering. The candles were unsteady in their holders and I wisely chose not to light them."
4,CLEP analyzing and Interpreting Literature,"This completely prepared me for the exam. If you can pass the practice exams, then the actual exam will be no problem."
1,Not really a study guide.......,"I took the Analyzing & Interpreting Literature Clep exam to fulfill some deficiencies for my Master's Degree. The material in this book was totally different than the actual exam. The material in this book is 10x more difficult than the actual exam. I feel that this is not a good study guide and the explanations are not well written to the point that they do not really explain the correct answer. I FAILED yet another Clep exam because of this book!!! Some things just did not make any sense. I studied by buttt off. I memorized almost every literary term out there because the book had many questions on them, however, on the actual exam, there were 1 or 2 questions on them. I was very disappointed."
5,CLEP - Analyzing and Interpreting Literature,Excellent review for the test. The book and acconpanying testing CD helped me get familiar (again) with the concepts necessary for the test. I highly recommend this book.
5,"Good book, easy test","This is one of the easier CLEP test. Although I am and always will be terrible at literature, nevertheless I aced the CLEP test. Everything the other reviewers say is true. The practice tests are hard, I scored in the mid-50's on all of them, but I passed with a 76 on the real test. If you can pass the practice tests with more than a 50, it's almost a guarantee that you will pass the real test. The literature review before the book is good and should not completely skipped (there are definitely some questions on the test that will require you to know definitions of literary terms), but the review before the book was probably slightly overkill."
1,DO NOT PURCHASE THIS ITEM - the CD is Wrong!,"I have been studying with the CD the book came with and just realized that the CD has different answers than the book. On both tests on the CD, the answers match the book up until question 39 and after that, the answers are different. I can't believe no one caught this before. Extremely frustrated! How can you study when you can't purchase a reliable source. Don't purchase this book!"
3,CD Test sent was wrong for the book version,"After finishing the test on the CD and getting a passing grade, I found the CD test was different from version in the book making it very hard to know what answers were missed.I'm going to ask for a refund. Otherwise, the study guide is very helpful but I bought this in order to practice taking the test and studying my incorrect answers. This mixup with the CD and book make that difficult."
2,You don't need the book,"I don't claim to be a literature freak; my reading consists of Sports Illustrated. However, this CLEP was very easy. I did not study, didn't read anything, and scored a 70. It is more intimidating than anything, so the book might give you a better idea of what to expect, but don't worry about the actual exam."
4,Decent book,I agree with the previous reviewer who stated that the sample tests in this book are much harder than the actual exam.Don't bother learning every last bit of terminology - just know the basics and you'll do fine.
1,Not a good book,I thought that this book was going to help me prepare for the Clep test well it helped some. I thought the tests in the book were much easier than the actually test. I didn't pass the test. Do not expect by reading this book you will be prepared for the actually test because you won't be. The actual test is much harder than the sample exams. Some of the vocab in the book did help but overall don't waste your money on this book.
3,Mmmm...dont need a guide for this.,The book is way harder than the actual test. After reading reviews from other amazon people about the test i got lazy and didnt read the clep guide past the 2nd chapter. the only studying i did was 5 questions on practice test 1 and looking up what alliteration and onomotopeia meant.the test takes long cause youre reading a bunch of stuff. the passages are a paragraph or two with a 2 or 3 being longer.if you have ever taken freshman high school english (the highest I have taken) you'll be fine. i got a 65 or something around there.
5,"Good study guide, do the questions","Ok, I took this CLEP test today. I used this book and read the material then took the first of the three practice tests. I then went through the answers to the 1st practice test and followed it up by taking the practice test in the CLEP official study guide 17th edition. I spent 3 to 4 hours in the material total and scored a 68. The practice test from this book was harder then the real test, however I was down to 1 minute and 30 seconds left for test time, so watch your clock on the real test. This test can be accomplished, I believe, with just this book. To speed up your study time, skim the reading in this book for just the bold faced terms and then spend your time in the practice tests and be sure to review your answers. This book will not give you the question or the answers to the real test, but you'll know what to expect and if you have good test taking skills you should do well. Good luck."
3,Airkraft-Airkraft,"I am a huge Airkraft fan and have seen them at numerous venues while the band was still together. I have owned this disc for years and in my opinion, it is average. I prefer the bands two other efforts, ""Proximity"" and ""In The Red"". I have been looking to find ""Proximity"" on the internet for years in any format with no luck. I don't think there is anything wrong with this disc, it's just I would rank it below the other's listed above."
4,Great Christian CD and change of pace for kids!!,"After listening to and singing along with half a dozen cd's with the same familiar tunes such as ""Old MacDonald,"" ""Itsy Bitsy Spider"" and ""Wheels on the Bus,"" I was in search of more meaningful yet fun music for my son. I bought this CD not knowing much about what Christian music is out there for kids or anything about the Cedarmont Kids who perform the songs. I was pleasantly surprised that most of the songs are entertaining both for my 18-mos old son and for my husband and I; they are easy to learn, sing along with and have a great Christian message. An added bonus is that the Cedarmont Kids are easy on the ear and aren't annoying to listen to like some other kids cds with kid performance groups.If you want an upbeat, fun Christian cd for your kids, this is a great one to start with!"
4,Fun and sweet songs,I bought this for my 7 year old daughter because the songs reminded me of when I was young. She loves it! The songs are timeless. I have bought several cedarmont CDs in the past. They tend to be very good. I have learned the covers that have harps and animals are more traditional which I like. If you like the more contemporary choose CDs with the zigzag lines. Hope this helps.thanks amazon!
4,Great book for beginning playwrights,"There are some good suggestions in this book. I used it to write plays for a playwriting class, and it was full of useful tips."
5,Word up is the best song to start a semi solo career!!!,"Melanie G starting her semi solo career with ""Word up"" was a great idea! The song is really good and I love it!"
4,Wish there were more,"I ordered this series just for something different, having no previous knowledge of the tv show before, and just love it. It's just a good, down to earth series for all viewing ages; something that is hard to comeby in this day. I highly recommend it, whether you are a teen, or three times that."
2,good seller severly dissapointed in book,This book was published after he was dead and couldn't stop them. I read a good review of this book. Either I couldn't understand this book or that guy was a liar. This guys plays are the greatest though. I absolutely love his plays. The best.
5,Worked well for 9 years. I'm using it again.,"When I originally had my tile installed, I had some professionals come in to seal the grout. They used this product. That was 9 years ago.Today, my grout is dirty, because it hasn't been scrubbed in forever. It's been mopped, not scrubbed. So, I scrub it with my Magic Eraser, all the surface dirt disappears and my grout is the original color! I have a lot of tile and there was only an occasional tiny stain, but for the most part, it is spotless.I decided to reseal as I'm scrubbing, since it's been so long and I am using the same product as the professionals used.On the label, it says it lasts 20 years under normal usage but to test it every 2 years just in case. My grout still resists water without the reapplication, but I am reapplying anyway.It takes 2 coats, let it sit 5 to 10 minutes between applications. It's a lot of work but worth it."
1,Don't waste your money! worst than 99 cents store sealer,"Don't waste your money! worst than 99 cents store sealer. Better go and buy and try products from Home Depot which are cheaper and way better. Also if you don't like you can go and return. This one was water based product, filled with no better liquid than you can find for couple of bugs at local store.Customer service of the seller (which is third party seller on Amazon) was horrible. First they said ""Go and talk to the manufacturer"" come on there is no contact of the manufacturer"", it looks like it was made by some corner factory, we don't know where. Seller totally refused to take it back, even they new product is garbage."
4,So far so good.,"Very happy with the machine so far . . . if it didn't cost so much I probably would have given it five stars. Great coffee, only complaint is the steam wand is too low to easily foam a tall coffee mug, Only problem so far is getting the grounds-bin full light to go off after emptying the bin. I finally figured out that if you turn off the machine before opening the door and dumping the bin, it doesn't know you did anything and will continue to flash when you turn it back on. It must count cycles rather than using a sensor."
3,Have now used it for over a year,"Overall it makes very good coffee (Peets is my standard) but it has a few problems. (1) For the kinds of beans I use (Peet's Sulawesi) which are very oily, one has to stir the grinder regularly to get the beans ground. If you use dry beans you won't have this problem. (2) The water tank indicates it is out even when it is half way full, so water has to be replenished regularly. (3)Occasionally, if the grind is too fine, it will clog up immediately and then you get only a slow drip. BUT...for the price it does a good job. To avoid these problems plan on spending about double."
1,"Don't buy from ""Whole Latte Love""","The unit that I purchased was advertised as ""refurbished"" when in fact it was heavily used and not even properly cleaned. When I called to ask for return authorization or replacement parts they refused. After repeated unanswered emails they still have never sent me the replacement parts for the unit. Not Gaggia's fault but they should think twice about continuing to use this company to distribute their products."
2,a dissapointing effort,"John was forced to record this album and it shows. His voice cracks on the high notes. His energy and humor are below the radar. Some of the songs were well written(Some Days, Country Love) but John just couldn't put any passion in to it. Still, this album does have a shining moment ""Wild Flowers"" is a great reflective piece. If only Dick Feller(author of Some Days) could have convinced John to sing with all his heart, John might have had something worthwhile..."
1,Very Disappointing,"I was a die hard John Denver fan during the '70s. But I sort of lost track of him after about 1980 and moved on to other music. Recently I have been revisiting his music. I can listen to ""An Evening with John Denver"" almost endlessly. But this is just about awful. I have heard that he did not want to do this album and I can see why. A Bobby Goldsboro song? Just plain awful. The title track and a couple of others are the only ones worth buying this for.I have to admit that it was very interesting listening to the maturity that had grown in his voice by the time this was recorded. If not for his very untimely death, we might have heard a lot more from him.I will miss his music, but I would not miss not having to listen to this album again."
4,The kingdom of Harmony: Here and Now,"A hundred years or so is not the limit, we can live for hundreds or even thousands of years when the environment and the living style of society as a whole is the right one.Instead of wasting it gradually, which depletes the system depriving you of your life, sexual energy can be transmuted transforming that essential power into spiritual-physical life force.The thing about preserving your youth, energy and health goes beyond a daily fruit and/or raw vegetables diet, it also must include:1. Sexual transmutation (essential)2. Daily contact with sun light (if possible)3. Drinking only alive, chemicals free water4. Fresh air breathing exercises (very important)5. Moderate physical exercise6. Positive thinking and meditation7. Sensible fasting8. An understanding that death is not a solution9. To live for physical immortalitySee also The Secret of Rejuvenation - Prof. Brown Sequard's Great Discovery by Raymond Bernard - 0787309982"
3,A book from the church of raw food juicing,"Every topic this author touches in this book receives the same advice: consume raw fruit and vegetable juices and have a few colonics. The author ignores totally standard approaches that help digestion such as drinking plenty of water and taking in fiber. The reader looses out on a thorough and comprehensive approach to health as the author is so taken by the raw food religion. Additionally, living on juiced raw food may not be the best long-term approach, although the book seems somewhat of a retort of the processed food diet that was gaining popularity in the late 1940s when this book was originally written."
5,The best information available about how to live to be 100!,Forget all the modern diet approaches to health. This is the best information available about how to improve and maintain your health and live to infinity! The research is rock solid and there are examples of the diet Dr. Walker followed throughout his life.
5,"incisive, bitter, and correct","If you are a teacher grinding your teeth over the institutionalized stupidity that daily prevents you from doing your job, read this book. If you think your children are not as smart as they should be, read this book. Mitchell exposes your worst fears about American schooling, but he also provides intellectual ammunition for fighting against the system. He brilliantly articulates the connections among reading, writing, and thinking skills; this book will make you a smarter crusader for sensible public education. Too bad it's been relegated to Kissinger status - the yellow kiss of death. Don't let the hideous packaging deter you: this book is as relevant today as it was in 1981."
3,Disappointed,"I was expecting a great watch, but it is only ok. You get what you pay for that is sure. (not very much)The seconds hand moves very jagged and not smooth like nice mechanical watches. I won't return because it would cost too much. I would not buy again though.That being said it works great so far and looks alright. Nobody even noticed at work so its good for not being too flashy."
4,New Orleans: the place and the people,Grace King's book is a vital work in understanding the history of New Orleans. The book describes the vibrancy and uniqueness of New Orleans in the 1800's.
2,Poor controlling abilities,"This is a pretty fun game, butthe controls are a little strange. The camera views make it hard to play when it automattically adjusts then you end up going in the opposite direction of which you intended. There are too many functions causing the game to be more involved than it needs to be. The levels and the graphics are to be expected in this game and in referrence to other Blood Omen/Soul Reaver games."
5,Not a music critic but...,"Firstly as a disclaimer, I am expressing my view only from personal taste and not as any expert. I have a varied taste in music as well and don't live in one particular genre. I first purchase this album on vinyl many, many, years ago. It is my preferred and only Alabama album. The love songs on this album are exceptional. Some of my favorite poetry includes, 'lying here beside you, I hear the echo of your sighs', 'while strolling through her mind, she stumbled on an old familiar feeling', ' but it's not the bottom, just part of a long hard fall', 'our love, a fading memory, as I chase another down', 'there's an old flame burning in your eyes, that tears can't drown and makeup can't disguise'. There's new love, lost love, forgotten love available on this album. And that is why it's been in my collection for so long."
3,too tight,I purchased this sheet to cover the mattress that I bought from the same company. I was surprised to find that the sheet fits very tight and I haven't even washed it yet. I hope it doesn't shrink or I'll have problems.
1,Handspring Software conflicts with Mac OS,"Ack! No sooner had I slipped my visor into it's cradle and eagerly tried the backup (long overdue since the demise of my Palm 3x), then the visor crashed. Not a little flickering kind of crash but a reset-the-whole-hunk-of-hardware crash. I contacted the handspring help desk via email (and a week later have yet to hear back). I went ahead and downloaded the Mac OS ""patch"" from the Handspring website (2 hours for us 56K modem-users) which cleared up the earlier incompatibility but created a new error in synching. I'm thinking of returning this in favor of a Palm again. Waaaay too much trouble."
1,non existant customer service,"I debated between palm and handspring.....and that has made all of the difference. The customer service is non-existant. No toll free number, very limited hours, I had sveral long waits to speak with a rep who spoke broken english. I was told I would be e-mailed with the XP up-grade...it never came. I had to chase it down and it still doesn't work. Apparrently after 90 days, they don't care you bought a product ....they charge you for tech help. Buy the Palm!!!"
4,My first PDA--not bad!,"I got this PDA awhile back and I must say it is a great way to store numbers and play games. Only thing I dont like is the backlight doesnt dazzle me, and oh yes, I let the batteries die and the thing completely died. It wouldnt let me sync or anything after replacing the batteries. But, the company advence exchanged it so I was satisfied. Very rarely will a moderately priced item be advance exchanged by any company, but Handspring wants your business! I love the module concept, it greatly increases functionality. A co-worker has a Compaq Ipac and I must say I love the Visor much more. WINDOWS CE IS A JOKE! Anyway, this is the one to get (dont buy the regular Visor). I would like to get the color one WITH rechargable battery, but I am going to wait until they produce a slim Edge style one with color and rechargable battery. That will be the best. Good job Handspring!"
4,Amazing product with one little fault,"I have bought this product..., and have been using it for about 2 months. It's an amazing product , much more beautiful than the Palm IIIxE . The only problem , that i just discovered now , it's that the Visor don't ship with Flash ROM memory. That means that you can't upgrade his OS ( that is a modified version of the Palm OS 3.1 ). This could or could not be a problem for you guys . If you are a expert user ( like me ! ) , this sure will make you very angry ( when the new versions of the Palm OS , like the 3.5 , ships out , and you will not be able to use it! ) If you are just a regular user , this could affect you little or nothing."
5,Flash ROM not needed,"One reviewer said that the Handspring falters due to the lackof Flash ROM. Handspring answers why they chose not to use Flash ROM... the Visor is upgradable via a Springboard module, and that most users would never need to rewrite the entire OS. Don't be afraid, a Visor is a great buy!"
4,"good product, very convenient if you need it","I like this product a lot because I travel so much. I can keep loads of info. and still keep in contact with my clients. It is fast, tiny, and I love the green color. If you need something portable, I would highly suggest this."
5,So encouraged!,"A great book that shows clearly how God moved in the lives of three men. I like this series because it gives short biographies of men that served God, but also it is a series that gives biblical encouragement to Christians. John Piper is a gifted author who can see God moving clearly in these lives."
4,For Sufferers,"This book is perfect for those who are going through suffering. Many times, when a Christian experiences deep trials and suffering, there is little help available from their friends and family. This book has been like a balm to the soul. Highly recommended for those who are hurting."
4,The Black Scorpion is Excellent.,"In this movie, a race of giant scorpions get loose in Mexico and start causing catastrophes. The special effects by Willis-O-Brian are superb. Richard Denning also play's a good roll as a professor from Mexico city."
4,Not too bad,THis was pretty good. Good special effects. Good plot. I like it. Kind of slow at beggining. but picked up speed.
4,Classic SciFi at its best,"As movies go, this is 'terrible'. So much so that it become entertaining. It takes place in a Mexican village near a volcano, and involves a gorgeous but unattached local woman who becomes romantically involved with the hero (duh). Her son gets into jeopardy and the hero saves him (duh). They don't show the woman showing her gratitude, but you know it's going to happen. :) If you like cheesy scifi, this is a must watch. The giant scorpions are not bad, and the plot is complex enough to baffle my basset hound, but my cat figured it out right away."
1,The Black Scorpion,This DVD was of very bad quality. It keep flickering and stopping until it just completely froze. I had to remove it from the player and watch another movie. I was very disappointed because this was going to one of my classic Halloween movies.
3,Watch Out For Those Scorpions!,"This was one of those good Giant movies. But the first half to me was quite boring. Now don't get me wrong, theaction of the Scorpions was good. They could have presented a better cover for this movie. Overall this was agood entertaining movie."
3,Effects are great!,"The effects are great and this is a worthwile movie if you can get past the stagnant acting that was the 50's, as far as monster flicks were concerned anyway. Great scorpion scenes but nothing more. Well worth a watch for stop motion fans but don't expect a whole lot in between those scenes."
3,Good fun movie,"I am a fan of this movie. For horror movie made in the 50's the special effects are very good. The story is of 2 scientists, Richard Denning is one, that go to Mexico to do research after an earthquake. They encouter several bizarre deaths along the way and soon discover that the earthquake has unleashed giant scorpions that are attacking and killing the local villagers. Mara Corday, one of my favorite 50's B movie horror queens, is around to supply beauty and a love interest for Denning. The story is surprisingly entertaining and again the effects good for the time. I recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of the horror movies of the 1950's."
4,lot of black/white,"good orig. show but the scorps where too,same loud. some repeated scorp scenes of itself and robotic. the scorps face closeups where too stiff lookin and a dark shadow of the scorp superimposed 2 lg. over the peo. of mx.-dumb. rather ent. movie; worth buyin fer monsta buffs. i rem. seein this flic in a motel in 69, in biloxi ms. b/4 hur. camile hit. funny how some memory stix."
2,no sting to this one!,"Hey, I love those B&W; ""B"" movies, but this one should be called the scorpion with no tail! It starts out with some good tension and what looks to be some good character development. Then we get some preposterous situations. The punch to this movie is the awful special effects! They should have left out the stupid close-ups of the drippy-mouthed scorpion! I lost track of how many times they showed that SAME close-up, and it never matched the rest of the scene that was occurring at the time. Hello editor! I guess I was supposed to be so busy screaming with horror that I wouldn't notice how cheesy it was. Sorry, I was too busy falling asleep on this dog!Get ""Them"" or ""The Lost World"" or ""The War of the Worlds"" (or even ""The Blob"" if you can handle cheesy special effects with a decent plot and decent characters)."
5,BETTER THAN DVD COVER!!!,"The dvd cover illustration shows the bad mock-closeup (minus drool) used several times too often in this 1957 b&w; giant monster classic. It gives the unwary viewer the false idea that one is in for an unintentional laugh-fest. Quite the opposite! This is an extremely well made stop-motion Willis(KING KONG)O'Brien animation masterpiece! The giant scorpions (and there are many!) move quickly and attack violently, stinging human victims as well as themselves. And the acting, photography and location shooting are all top-notch making this a must see and one of the top three of it's kind along with BEAST FROM 20,000 FATHOMS and THEM!So don't be swayed by the cover into thinking this is just some lame grade Z cheepie. It's really ONE OF THE BEST!!!"
1,No glitter,"I received plain old modeling dough, not the glitter dough I ordered. Don't know who is at fault: the seller or Amazon fulfillment. Received however prompt refund from Amazon; great customer service, as usual."
5,PLEASE HELP ME FIND THIS!!!,I remember this album from the early 90's and can't find it anywhere. I have searched the entire web it seems like and can't locate it. Please help me find this album. Even if you make a copy for me and sell/send it to me. I would greatly appreciate it.
2,Good & Bad,"The material is thin, not plush. That suited me just fine because I wanted a towel I could lie on the beach with or something simple that I could dry myself off with. If your expectation is a plush, thick bathroom kind of towel, this isn't for you.Speaking as an adult male over 6 feet tall, I wish the towel was about 5 inches wider and 5 inches longer. Often I would lie on the towel and slip off the sides and get sand all over my arms. Or, I would lie on my stomach and the front of my legs would all get sandy. I'm sure kids may not care about this so much, but for me it was annoying.The graphics are crisp and look great. I think this would get more than 2 stars from me if it was just a larger towel (or available in a larger size)."
5,If you like kick action heroines...,"Warslayer is an excellent book, especially if you are a Xena fan. It's a must read if you are looking for an exciting adventure. Check it out."
3,The story is kind of childhood,The story was ok but not very exciting. I believe that it is a book more for kids than for older people.
4,fall off your chair funny,"This only got four stars because of all the insider references. If you were not a Xena fan you will not get this book. That said, The Warslayer is hysterically funny. Love the episode guide at the end. Someone please option this for TV!"
3,Nice idea but doesn't cut it,"I'll give this an extra star for a great concept - but that only brings it up to 3 stars because I didn't like the presentation.It's standard, almost to the point of cliche, to comment in a fiction book how a fiction book would gloss over all those little realistic details that have to happen in everyday life. This book didn't skip over them and that's what I don't think I liked. It was too realistic. I don't want realistic in my fiction, I want dramatic, astounding and amazing. I want to escape reality for a little while, not wallow in it.I just didn't get drawn in and immersed. I somehow remained outside looking in, knowing I was outside.You have to admire the attention to detail of someone who creates an actual episode guide (includign some with bad reviews) for a show that only exists in a fictional book. But that doesn't mean you necessarily want to read said episode guide. Somehow I think Buffy's ratings are secure if this is the competition."
3,A new study of life.,The story of life and the very idea that we can do what is required to get the very best of life.
2,"Oh, too bad!","I am a die-hard Rosemary Edgehill (Eluki Bes Shahar) fan,but this one let me down. Compared with her delightful,original, and unfairly truncated Twelve Treasures series andher wonderful Bast mysteries, this novel was a clunker.Its framing device is clumsy and just doesn't work, andGlory/Vixen doesn't crack wise as naturally and realisticallyas a typical Eluki heroine. Even Eluki's collaborationswith Andre Norton and Mercedes Lackey seem more her ownstyle. I even liked her Wiccan romance novel better!Ah, Eluki, what happened?"
3,"Good songs, but the delivery is lacking","Pobba's songs are well-written and colorful, but they'd frankly be better if sung by someone else. Pobba just doesn't seem to have the kid-friendly delivery that one finds with, for example, The Wiggles. I'd like to see Pobba hand his little gems over to someone else. Nothing personal, but I want what's best for my kids' ears."
5,Zany Songs with Catchy Tunes,"What an ""amazing 'magination"" Pobba has to create zany songs with catchy tunes that my grandkids and I love to sing! I highly recommend it to anyone with kids three to eight. I can hardly wait for the next cd!"
3,"""How To"" for UFO's","There are not much books like this in the field of UFO investigation. It is a good beginners ""how to"" for research of UFO phenomenon. Only problem is it is overly beginners material and it is full of unecesary images and explanation of trivial things. I must say I was expecting much more proffesional aproach to it.But it is still a scool book for any researcher out there."
5,Big help,"Big help, I've found 43 UFOs and met several alien races in the short 3-month span since I've purchased this book. Thank you Craig and Stanton!"
5,A mediocre movie with magnificent shots of Heifetz.,"Although the plot to this movie is as cornball as it gets, the footage of Jascha Heifetz is simply amazing. The close-ups of his bow and fingers show what an awesome violinist Heifetz was. This is a must for all violinists to see."
5,Great Little Knife,Love this little knife.Best knife i have ever used for tomatoes.I will buy more Komachi Knives when on sale.
4,Learn The Bible in 24 hours,"Excellent Book. Anyone that is looking for a thorough explanation on so many unanswered questions this is the book for you. Not only has it helped me to understand the Bible so much better, but it has opened my prospective on things I never imagined. Chuck Missler does a great job at connecting the dots. He backs up all of his information with very informative research."
2,an ok Bible primer,"As ""Fun With Dick and Jane"" type books go, this is adequate. I would encourage those who seek a quick approach to understanding the Bible to come to grips with the fact that it takes more than 24 hours. It is dangerous to apply the immediate gratification concept to spiritual truths. Some things need to be taken slowly."
2,under par..,"I can't recomend this, 'Cliff's notes' commentary. I've read several in this vien. Read, 'The Complete Idiot's Guide To The Bible' instead, it's much better."
4,Thirsty for Knowlege,"This book gives some insigts to many things I have wondered about - Jesus' lineage to David, dinosaurs - many other things are pointed out in this book to help you better understand the Bible."
5,Learn the Bible in 24 Hours,"This book was very interesting to read. I loved the way the author brought together facts that I never understood from a basic reading of the Bible. I had a lot fun learning about each book of the bible and who each was written by and to.Reading this book has helped the Bible to make a lot more sense to me - particularly the Old Testament.It's amazing how a book - the Bible - was written over so many, many years and by the hand of so many different men yet, all comes together and weaves the story of mankind, his savior, his redemption and his purpose."
5,The best Biblical Introduction/Overview,"Dr. Missler does a phenomenal job of summarizing such a complex and important topic in terms for the layman. The views he presents are definitely biblically founded, though not always popoular within even christian circles. If you are looking for a door to begin your journey through the Bible, this book is a wonderful introduction.Dr. Monty Ham"
5,Alot of useful information for newcomers to eBay!,Sometimes when you first start out online you don't realize the in's and out's of navigating on a Web site such as eBay. This book spells it out and even helps out those of us who have been selling on eBay but want to learn a little more. I would highly recommend this book for the newbie and intermediate sellers for sure!
2,Broke within 1 hour,The laser broke within one hour. Before that it worked great. Replacement is on the way. Hopefully this one works better
5,THE AIRPLANE AT ITS HIGHEST ALTITUDE!,IF YOU COULD ONLY OWN ONE PSCYCHEDELIC ALBUM IN YOUR COLLECTION THIS SHOULD BE IT.
5,YOU'LL BE OVER THE MOON FOR THIS BOOK!,"This little book is an exhaustive, informative and well organized piece of Lunar Astrological literature. Anyone interested in a nerdy, but intermediate source for Lunar Astrology should consider this book."
5,It's All Here,I can't think of a single aspect of the history of the Bessarabian German culture that this book doesn't cover extremely well. I was amazed at how much better I understand my family history after having read this publication.
3,Good but for people who are more concerned with repairing relationship,"This was a good book but it's more directed to repairing or salvaging your relationship with your abusive/difficult parents, despite the title (""Cutting Loose"").For some people this may be a possibility but for others it is not because the parent is too narcissistic or abusive to deal with and the book offers surprisingly little in the way of advice on that topic.If you are dealing with a truly narcissistic/abusive parent and you feel that you need to cut ties find a different book. If you are in the throes of re-negotiating your relationship with your parent and you want a book to give you strength in possibly making a decision to cut ties, find a different book.If your main goal is repair the relationship or make it work than this would be a good choice for you."
5,Great Find!,"As with any self help book, some parts will apply, some parts won't. However, the parts that do apply (at least in my case) were extremely helpful. This is definitely a meat and potatoes book - i.e. it's not something I could read quickly. It's also not sugar coated."
5,What a great CD set !!!,"I first was attracted to this CD set because of popular tracks by Cygnus X, Paul Van Dyk, DJ Jurgen/Alice DeeJay, and BT... But upon listening to this set I was totally WOWed !! Not only is the CD mixed seamlessly, but it's a really good experience as a whole for any Trance newbie or otherwise. Yes, there are 40 tracks, and yes that is a lot for ANY 2 CD set, but that's also a good thing because you get to hear a lot of different artists. I agree that it is kind of a negative that the tracks are so short, especially for a Trance Album... A 3rd or 4th CD would have been nice... But GET THIS ALBUM... It's worth every penny!!"
5,Great Stuff!,"This is a great, non-stop selection of some of the best, most melodious, most famous trance hits-40 of them! They are beautifully mixed. The only complaint: because there are so many, each cut is only about 3 minutes long."
5,THE NAME SAYS IT ALL,For any one who likes music with rythm at all this is the cd to buy. What the heck Buy 2 one for listening and one for the archives. This great cd collects the essentials for Hard Trance.Take it from a music critic this is the One to buy.
2,"Good, Not Great","This CD is only good if you are into generic Trance ... or are an artistic purist that loves the Trance that can bore you or put most people to sleep. If you like upbeat, catchy, beautiful and memorable Techno/Trance tunes then this is NOT the CD for you. A couple of the tracks are really good, such as Chicane's Saltwater, Robert Mile's Children, and Veracocha's Carte Blanche. But those are available on other CD's. Better yet, just buy a Robert Mile's or Ian Van Dahl CD. Again, this is good, but not great."
4,"GOOD, but not GREAT","Hey, great selection of tracks, yeah, most of them are classics, but John ""00"" Flaming, did not put his heart out mixing the songs... After all there are 40 songs to hear from, so it makes the job a little bit harder, but i belive he could have emphasize more time to it, to release an essential one. For a begginer its a must have, but if you are a dj or have experience about good trance music, try to buy it used.. thats what i did. It came in handy.. *--cheers..."
5,Definatly getting your moneys worth!,"This is an awsome cd! i personally love disk 2..especially track 16 (the orange theme) This comp. was put together and mixed with great expertise. This is definatly one of the best trance comps. I have heard in a long while! If you love trance, or are a fan in any way I gaurantee that you will love this album. The tracks are for sure to get your blood flowin' and you body movin'!!!"
4,A Wonderful Compilation,"I dont know why people have giving this cd such low marks. It is truly a great cd. I keep it in my stereo at all times. It works wonderfully for parties and everything about it is great. Sure, maybe a few of the songs have been overplayed at clubs, but this quickly gets over shadowed by the astounding amount of songs on the cd.Which Brings us to another matter. Since their are SO many songs on the cd The songs are really short. I dis-like short songs, but i have to admit that the radio edits are rather good.So in betweed floor stomping, i would have to rate this cd 4 stars and a distinguishable A- ...."
1,It's not as good as I expected,"I was looking for a real manual, not just a compilation of Lozanov's work. It is not useful if you want to learn how to apply the technics."
1,party pack,Party pack was cheap. You do not have enough plates if you doubled up on the plates for a little more support.
2,Disappointing,"I was somewhat disappointed with this book. There are better ones. Awfully basic, no originality. The charts are often geared towards punch card design. Somewhat outdated."
5,"Easy to use, but inconvenient for large cats","Just fill up the bottle, screw it into the base upside down, and turn over. It didn't spill any water, which surprised me. Easy to rinse out, and I think it's dishwasher safe.[edited by me] It says this is for cats and small dogs. The dish is about as big around as a soda can, and right next to the bottle. My cat has a big head so it's inconvenient -- he doesn't like to use it.This product still gets 5 stars but I hope they make a bigger one =-)"
5,Find Out Where The Money Is,"Dr Bob's passion,spirit and wit makes this a memorable read for all invetors. His ""top ten things to remember"" in each chapter keeps the facts crystal clear. Where The money Is provides us with a great reference tool as we face the turbulent times ahead."
5,Another good one!,"These guys are amazing! So far I have 5 of their CDs and each one is just wonderful. Their consistency of excellence every time out is just phenomenal. All the numbers are good, but my favorites on this one: ""What Do I Know?"",""Wings"" such a fun song--encouraging, actually makes you wanna fly; ""The Nature of Love,"" and the Oh, so gorgeous ""As Long as My Heart Knows it's You!"" Kirk Sullivan leads on three of these, but the soulfulness in his voice on this gorgeous song is simply divine.I get amazed every time I hear a 4HIM song, at what an awesome gift they've been to Believers who hear this music, and what a wonderful ministry they have."
3,It Lacks Pictures...,"When I ordered this book, I was impressed by the title and the beautiful marzipan rose on the cover. I am very disappointed to find out that it lacks pictures. It has NO pictures at all. The font and the layout are very nice and the instructions are clear. Most of the recipes are set as menus and the ingredients are not hard to find. However, I do not enjoy reading the recipes nor feel like trying them because I do not know what they will look like. I have had the book for about a year and have not tried any of its recipes yet."
3,"Not for the ""bigger"" Man.","I bought this for my husband and he is ""larger"" in that area and the product is really tight... I know that should be a good thing but for this product it doesnt work if it is really tight. And the length of the product is only about 4 inches also..but enjoy!!!!"
2,Lousy Product,This thing is way to small. The opening is the size of a pencil. Way to tight and not a good product at all. Wish I could get my money back.
4,Great camera... But.,"Great camera - Well thought out, good quality pictures and movies.Everything goes on the memory stick - No moving tapes or motors to malfunction.The only feature absent is an optical viewer (it only has the LCD screen to see what you will be filming). It's tough to frame your shot in dark, as the screen will not have the illumination until the flash lights - and then it's to late to frame your shot! Same problem for outdoor shots on bright days where the image is hard to see on screen."
3,Windows Vista,I purchased this camera in Feb 2006 and it has been great!! Untill I got a new computer with Windows vista. The software that comes with it will not load on windows vista so I have not been able to tranfer videos and keep them organized as I did. As a result I have lost most all video clips that have not been edited to DVD formatt. I also cannot load new video clips to my computer. I attemped to reach Panasonic as I could find no downloads to fix this problem. They have never gotten back with me.
2,Poor Low Light Vedio Recording,"This product has very poor Low Light(Indoor) recording.In fact my Cannon S115(powrshot) 3.1 MP, 10X Cannon digital camera out performs this expensive model in low light.Even capturing the Photos in Indoor was pretty bad, compared to cannon digital camera.In Bright Sunlight Outdoor, the color of SDR-S100 were lot Better.If you do most of your recording Indoor, i would suugest not to buy this exoensive model.I am returning this camera."
3,it's ok but the original is better,who's the original artist?i'm looking for the original song.if you know the original artist or you have the song please email me
2,Several problems with this item....,"I bought two of these at Boaters World. There was a minor problem and a major problem. The minor problem is that they are a hassle to take on and off - which you have to do when you cover your boat which we do after each usage. The major problem is that they have a weak point just above the bracket where both of mine have bent over and broken when exposed to wind which, of course, they are on the water.They did not last long and I don't recommend them."
3,Buyer Beware! Playback Issues! READ!,I was very surprised when buying this NEW that the discs didn't play back on my Playstation 3 or my Playstation 2. Some of them did but 90% of them didn't! Other DVD players seem to work. But be aware of this so you aren't suprised like I was. I'll be keeping the set as I can watch them on other media. But I'm not to happy about it.
4,Bought it as a gift...,"Excellent value, $16 a series. Unheard of ! I wish it was available on bluedisc, I would have implemented the savings towards the upgrade."
2,Leather version was great; satin not so much,"I bought two pairs of these super comfortable flats a few years ago when they were made of soft genuine leather and absolutely loved them. I still have a pair that I wear sometimes even though it looks really old and beat up now.I thought the satin version would fit similarly. I bought it in black and was very disappointed. The leather felt so much better on your foot and was soft right away with no breaking in necessary. The satin version looks cheap and the top part just isn't as comfortable.BC Footwear, if you're reading this, please bring back the leather model! I would buy several pairs!"
3,cute shoes but hurts,These shoes are super cute but hurt my feet. They haven't caused any blister but are very narrow in the front. I felt like my bones around my toe area was getting crushed. After I take them off my feet are red and I have the shoe lining imprinted on my foot everywhere. I did get used to them but can't wear them for long walks.
4,where are the 9 1/2's,The shoe is great. I've tried to purchase more in 9 1/2 for way too many months. Co. needs to stay plugged into supply and demand.
5,Best book for true history.,True accounts of the emmisaries of the Messiah throughout the ages. Foundation stone to study history. Catholic false authority label true bride as heretics like manicheans[but are not] to murder and torture Jesus' true love.
2,Originality = 0%,"I like most of the scandanavian bands that i've heard (turbonegro, hellacopters, bombshell rocks,etc...) but this album is crap...the guitars are not terrible...but other than that, the album was unlistenable for me...the singer is too monotone and sounds like a sleepy dracula or something...some of the songs have cheesy back up vocals like something you'd hear in a britney spears song...the whole album is way over produced...plus they kinda rip off about 10 different bands...( misfits, feilds of the nephilim, turbonegro, the cult, and every goth band from the 80's)the guitars are the only thing that earn any stars on this album...and really, they weren't all that special either..."
5,This band rocks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"For anyone that doesn't know this band very well, this is the cd you should pick up first. All of the 69 eyes cds are all catchy but this one is for people just started listening to them. A damn great cd with songs that you'll find youself singing all day long. The song Lost Boys kickass it rocks and its based off a an old movie called Lost Boys. The whole cd is great."
3,Better things in the genre,"I'm not saying that this is a bad band. But the 69 Eyes are not as memorable. They started off as a cheesy biker rock band(see their debut album Bump & Grind), and eventually got more melodic. Most of Wasting The Dawn is pretty good, but their music seems very forced. Like, ""Look how goth we are, will you buy our albums now?"" I know this is harsh but come on, with bands like Tiamat and Type O Negative there is no need for The 69 Eyes. A better band from Finland worth checking out is Sentenced cause they rock! Get Wasting the Dawn if you have to own one of their albums, otherwise skip the rest. Buy Type O Negative's October Rust or Tiamat's A Deeper Kind Of Slumber if you want a beautiful gothic rock album."
2,Far from their best,"If ur into goth soft rock this album might be for you, but if ur a longtime fan who remembers the heavy guitars and dark sleaze stay well clear, thank god they found their guitars again on Angels, a far superior album!!!"
5,Sturdy Stand,Great product to use with any 4 cord pilates machine. It is easy to assemble and very sturdy. The stand makes the pilates machine easier to use if you have trouble sitting on the floor.
3,Not worth the price,"Bought this for my daughter. She loves to stack the cups, but the rest is boring for her. Was not worth the price for five minutes of play."
3,Multi-function toy-colorful and good for little hands!,"I was very excited to receive this toy since it can be used as a puzzle, stacking/nesting toy and color matching game. It's a bit smaller than what is pictured, but it's perfect for little hands. My daughter loves to take the puzzle pieces apart and match the shapes/colors so it's really good for developing young little minds, motor and cognitive skills. It also stands up to being walked on, thrown, and banged against other toys so durability is A+"
4,A surprise,It's a cute concept for a beginner puzzle with a couple of other things to add interest but my 10 month old son couldn't care less about it.UPDATE: From just under 2 to just under 3 my son played with this toy quite a bit! I would sit with him and we would take it all apart and he would put it together several times and feel quite accomplished each time! I would also stack or nest the cups while he was trying to put it together and he enjoyed destroying that and putting each piece in it's proper place. Now my 13 month old son is just starting to get interested in it. Very durable.
4,flamenco music,"the guitar playing is excellent, i love the sound of flamenco. i tried to copy it to c.d. but it did,nt work.not to worry."
2,flimsy quality,"My son likes the trains and they look very realistic but Playmobil makes a flimsy product. It takes very little for the train to fall off the tracks and pieces are always popping off (like the windshield, antenna, etc.). We also have the garbage truck that Playmobil makes and we have the same issue. They look very cool but you'll spend 75% of the time trying to put it back together while your child sits by and watches."
2,Look out for quality,"I bought two RC Express trains from Playmobil, one for my nephew and one for my daughter. It's a nice toy, but look out for quality. BOTH trains had the same problem. One of the wheels on the engine platform cracked (it's just plastic). It's a very expensive toy and I think that Playmobil should have done a better job putting their main component together."
2,warning! Be careful with compatibility,"All Canon HDV cameras has an important issue: if you record in 24F or 30F modes, the tapes can only be played back in the camera itself. Canon records those signals in a proprietary mode that is not HDV compliant. YOU CANNOT PLAYBACK THE TAPES IN ANY DECK OR CAMERA other than Canon."
3,"OK product, but there are better options","I bought this CD for my son (2 years old at the time). It was OK, but my son didn't like it very much. He prefers the other CD we've been playing for him ever since he was born - Baby Einstein Lullaby Classics.It is a misconception that you have to play toddler tunes for toddlers. We all get used to what we've been trained for. For example, my son actually likes The Most Relaxing Classical Album and The Most Relaxing Piano Album (two of my favorites) best. So the point is, if there is no difference to the kids, why purchase something specially for the kids that doesn't serve much purpose for kids' education?"
4,Quite likable,"My son likes a good number of songs on this CD. He recognizes and dances to the songs even when I sing them around the house. The music and children's voices are quite tolerable to the grown up ear. There are a couple ""religious"" songs, and those too are tolerable, assuming you do believe in god, (FYI one does specifically mention the bible)."
3,it's OK,This CD has most of the typical toddler favorite songs so my 2 yo enjoys it. The price was right- and it makes her happy- but don't expect spectacular vocals- some of the kids are too young to sing in tune LOL. I don't really see the point of the second set of tracks though....
1,Bland Music,"The music/singing isn't very fun or creative - I'm sticking with Lori Berkner, David Weinstone or They Might Be Giants and going acapella with the classics for my 2 year old. I wanted a basic CD of some of the classics, but this one is doomed to the yard sale pile."
3,OK,My 4 year old loves music & this is a good CD but we've over played the songs a bit & he got tired of it fast.
5,Calm a crying child....it works EVERYTIME!,"My son has been listening to this CD since he was 6 months old, he also has the video, and now at 19 months he knows the words to a lot of the songs and because of the video, he does the hand motions to match. This would be a great gift for new parents, include the Toddler Tunes video and they will be set. It is also sung by children and the songs are great to sing along to. Enjoy!"
4,Toddler Tunes~ Cedarmont Kids,"The songs are great, my 1 year old daughter loves them. I used the CD at her birthday party and all the kids were dancing and singing along. The only thing I'm not crazy about is that the CD only has 25 songs, I thought it was 50 songs but it's just a repeat of the first 25 songs."
2,Be warned...,"While I thought most of the songs were cute, I would have appreciated a warning that this is CHRISTIAN baby songs. There are a couple of songs that are clearly religious... and I was uncomfortable with my child listening to this CD."
1,Kids didn't like it,"My grandkids ( 3 and 5) refused to listen to this. They just didn't like it for some reason. Personally, I found it annoying, the kids singing the songs are too high pitched, and it sounds like a bunch of first graders wallering. It went to CASA."
4,"great quality, low price","My son's face lights up when I play this CD in the car. I like the variety of songs and children's voices. I don't particularly like the children's CDs with adult voices because I think it sounds cheesy (unless its Julie Andrews- only exception). Needless to say, I am really glad I found this one."
4,Enjoyable tunes for little ones,"I got this CD for my daughter on her 1st birthday. She loves it. Although some songs were repeat from her other CD, it has different lyrics and helps me combine all the different versus when I sing back the song to my daughter. She listens to it daily on her way to day care and enjoys it everytime. I like the fact that all the songs are sung by kids."
4,Good CD,"If you want something a little sophisticated with adults singing - this is NOT the CD for you.The CD features kids singing some of the older traditional preschool songs.My daughter seems to like the kids' voices and I guess that's the point of this CD.I am not particulary fond of listening to it over and over again but that's also to be said for Barney, the Wiggles, Dora, or any of your standard toddler fare played over and over and over.There are 4 songs that would be considered religious: God Made Me, Father We Thank Thee, Deep and Wide, Get on Board. I don't think any of them mention Jesus. God Made Me and Father We Thank Thee make reference to God and/or Father. So if this makes you uncomfortable, don't buy the CD."
5,A wonderful manga and anime.,"I have to admit that I overlooked DNAngel for the longest time. I'm glad I finally got around to reading it though. It's a great story with sometimes predictable, but usually captivating outcomes. The characters really make this show worth watching though. You can't help but think Daisuke's ""romantic"" ways are rather cute, We all have to say that With/Wiz is really fuzzy and cute (I want one o_o), and many of us girls can't help but love the way Dark's so mysterious, suave, and flirty ^_^ All the characters have something or another likable about them. Even if you have to dig waaaay deep to find it.It gets you wondering about what really is considered ""good"" and when it's okay to bend the rules a couple times. (and just how far you'd go to get a date with Dark =P)Overall, DNAngel is a great story with romance, humor, and wonderfully beautiful bishonen that you begin to wish truly existed in real life... *is thrown out of the room for the bishonen comment*"
5,Wonderful Series!,"I picked up the first two manga about 2 months ago and fell in love immediately. It's a wonderfully written and illustrated series that's funny and serious and absolutely fantastic. Of course, it helps that Dark, Daisuke's other personality, is hot.Any lover of series such as Furuba (Fruits Basket), Escaflowne, Magic Knights Rayearth, CCS, etc., would love this series."
4,"D. N. Angel, Dark Angel","By Karen JonesD. N. Angel is an excellent read. Daisuke Niwa is the main character he's a middle school student who has a very interesting quirk. Whenever this boy longs for the girl he loves, he transforms into the legendary Phantom Thief Dark. Dark, who is considered suave handsome, is trapped within Daisuke's body, they share it.Since the day Daisuke Niwa was born he has been trained into the family business, thievery. His mother insists on daily training which consists of picking locks, knowing security systems and how to get around them, and being able to survive traps. All normal for his family. All the males born into the Niwa clan go through the exact same transformation, until the day their loved one, returns the feeling.It is emotional and fantastic adventures keep you on the edge, wanting to read more and unable to suppress the hunger to read on. Daisuke though, is not alone; there is yet another person who searches for him..."
4,"Dn Angel..An ""Ok"" manga","I haven't quite finished the whole collection yet but I plan on doing so. It's mainly about a young boy with a family curse that makes him change into the ""Phantom Thief Dark"" a man who goes to an art museum at 9:00 every night. I started to read the book from a preview from an anime DVD. To me it doesn't really pull you in as much as other manga that I've read plus I'm not too romantic the main reason I've stayed with this series is for the action when Dark tries to steal the art. Some may choose this for the romantic factor so I'll talk about that too! Daisuke a 14 year old boy (Main character) had a crush on Risa...When Daisuke asked her out she said no because she liked dark (NOTE: Nobody except Diasuke's family knows that he is also dark.) Then Daisuke began to have feeling for Risa's twin sister Riku and the good thing is Riku had feelings for Daisuke."
2,I am Disappointed,"I am. So many people liked this series, I went to read it.But in my opinion, it's kind of boring. This series is mostly based on romance, but when you have romance playing such a big role, you must have depth and feeling, which this book is clearly lacking. It's just all action action action, with barely any time to think, and the plot isn't so interesting.I give it a two because the title is clever and the pictures are well drawn. And it's humorous. Kind of."
2,Just OKAY,"The artwork is good, but the story is very dull. Daisuke just runs around stealing artwork and following in his families' footsteps. Then the only way he can return to his normal life and not have to steal artwork is by having his true love return his love....how many books can they make out of this story?! I expected better of the book since I heard it was a fantastic animee show. Take my advice.....don't buy it."
1,Not for beginners,"This is not an instructional DVD. Nor is it for beginners.The DVD bills itself as containing ""lessons"" from a professional guitar teacher for each song. These ""lessons"" consist of a little history of the song, then a VERY brief review of the tuning and chords. Then, the song is played full speed, with the tab underneath (in 2 of the 3 camera views).The song is not begun at slower speed, or broken down into sections.There is no tab booklet, or online access to the tab. It is onscreen only.If you are advanced enough with your playing to be able to play along with this DVD, I'm not sure you need the DVD. If you need more instruction to learn the songs, look elsewhere.For my level of playing (1 plus years), this DVD is pretty much useless."
4,Fun with horses,"This is a clever little book with a British sense of humor. Captions are mostly tongue-in-cheek, with drawings showing the truth of the matter. Fun to read as well as to add to your collection."
4,"Sateen cotton, not regular egyptian cotton","While I found the quality of this duvet cover (and its accompanying shams) to be good -- especially for the price -- I wasn't expecting it to be made of COTTON SATEEN. I was looking for a basic cotton duvet cover with decent thread count. I ordered the item in red which is a nice bright, true red but in the sateen it's a little too silky and shimmery for my taste."
2,"Not Free SF Readernot free sf reader,n","A quite poor attempt at a story that has been done before.A woman ends up being created to save the world due to an obsession, but is that what she is really up to?"
4,Good starting point,"This isn't a precise history, nor does it claim to be. This is a book that will give you a concise history with some good maps. The major battles and aftermath of the war are covered, as well as some interesting facts and figures about the war. My only complaint is that they only wanted to use a few colors in the maps. It would be nice if future additions would bring out more colors to help us better view the maps."
1,"Just an ""Infomercial""","I was surprised and disappointed to find The EQ Edge was just an ""infomercial"" for Reuven Bar-On's emotional intelligence test. Steven Stein is the publisher of the test AND the book's senior author. The book's content is largely a series of testimonials and unsubstantiated claims which have the same credibility as the latest diet fad.I am a practicing Industrial/Organizational Psychologist who would love to have a genuine test of emotional intelligence; but, in my opinion, Bar-On's EQ-i test fails to measure up to basic professional standards of validity.In a nut shell, it is under researched and over hyped. At this point in it's development, the test is definitely not something I would dare use for real world personnel decisions."
1,The one from oreck looks exactly the same and it is a flop,"This is the exact same model and make of the oreck air purifier, which I have, only the logo is different. These do not do anything, they also take 4 C batteries and they suck them dry way too quickly which turns out to be very costly. Do not waste your money on this model, they may have a different logo on them, but pay attention to the way they look, their design. You can change the batteries (way too often) but there is no way to change the filter inside. Save your money try a different one. I mean completely different one. Don't even bother with the ones that look like this one, you will feel cheated. Even a $1.00 feels like a cheat when the thing you spend it on never works :/"
2,It's not what you think!,"The styles in the video was all right, but what client would come back to the salon and get the same hair style done over. I wish she show different styles and not the same one done over & over."
4,Professional DVD,"This DVD is one of the most professional, educational DVDs out today. This stylist takes great measures to ensure you are able to see, follow along and implement the techniques shown on this video."
3,Couple Of High Points On This Forgotten Record,"This is probably one of the least purchased recordings by the Entertainer of the Millenium, Elvis Aron Presley. It is actually recordings for earlier years, and there are not many 'great' songs on the album. However, the couple that is worth buying the album for is ""Sound Advice"", which can probably be found on the ""Follow That Dream"" soundtrack, and ""Summer Kisses, Winter Tears"", which is an OUTSTANDING song that makes buying this worthwhile, because the song can't be found on any other Elvis album.GOD BLESS YOU ALL!"
3,"You know what it takes, you got it, baby!","This Elvis Presley album was released in 1965. It consisted of songs that had never been previously released (other than ""Summer Kisses, Winter Tears""). To be honest, most of these songs had been previously unreleased because they weren't considered good enough to release, until they got really hard up for material. The oldest song here is ""Tomorrow Night"" which dates all the way back to Elvis' second Sun Records recording session. Tragically, they ruined the song by overdubbing additional musicians and singers to it. As for the rest of the songs, there are some good ones and some not so good ones. No real ""classic"" Elvis songs here, honestly. My personal favorite is probably ""Memphis"". This album is a real hodgepodge. I might also mention that the album is only 24 minutes long, and it has a terrible cover."
4,The World Through Questions,"The BOOK OF QUESTIONS was written in 1973, a few months before Neruda's death to cancer. Troubled by the knowledge of his impending death, as well as by a U.S. backed coup threatening the Allende government in Chile (Leftist regime 1970-73), Neruda wrote several small books of brief poems, comprised simply of unanswerable questions, in the koan tradition (question/statement in the form of a paradox that disciples of Zen ponder). They are enigmatic, at times surreal, leaving you lost in labyrinths of deep thought, or in abstract bewilderment.My favorite questions include:Why do leaves commit suicideWhen they feel yellow?andWhen the convict ponders the lightis it the same light that shines on you?--ross saciuk"
5,Wonderful questions/poems.,"This is one of the best collections of poems by Neruda. Insightful, provocative, charming, lovely, wonderful questions which are poems and poems which are cast as questions. I let someone borrow my copy and never got it back! I'm ordering another copy because this is one collection one should return to often."
3,30yrs after the fact,"Bought this after seeing SLF play in Chicago 06.06. They still deliver. The book is a long interview conducted by a superfan who interjects himself too much for this to be journalism. What is missing is in fact the actual lyrics to the songs they are talking about. There's some true funny bits and some interesting factoids and its a fair read, but overall it's a loosely charted conversation that could have better served the subject."
3,Works but not perfectly,"This product did decrease the amount of barking that my dogs did, and I like that this product does not cause any harm to the dog however they did not stop barking completely. One of my dogs is quite a barker. She has this loud and piercing bark that is just unstopable but this product did decrease the amount of her barking. You have to use it indoors (it says that right on the box). I think it's a good alternative to shock collars, sedatives or sprays (which can cause ear and eye infections)."
4,Guess who,The guess who should be higher up on the sixtys food chain. They wrote a lot of great songs. Not just the ones you hear on the radio.
3,Nice looking but wouldn't work on bottom step,"You can't install this anywhere that your foot would need to land. I wanted this at the bottom of the staircase. There is a very high lip on the bottom so your foot would need to step over it, not on it. Gate looked great, nice in black. Just didn't work out for me."
5,good product,"We've purchased two of these gates, although our other one is called a bindaboo, which is identical to this gate, but just rebranded for unknown reasons. It's easy to set up, and we used only the friction mount setup instead of mouting the cups. The only thing that would be nice is a way to override the auto close feature. After the baby goes down for nap or for sleep, the adults still have to open the gate every time we go thru. I've done this with a bungy cord, and it works pretty well."
3,Dream baby Swing Gate,"This gate was not as it said, the measurement were just a little off and it was to big for the door that I wanted to use it in, so I had to return the gate.The return process was easy."
3,NO matter how I install it the self close mechanism is finicky.,"Maybe it's that I live in earthquake country and my house is in no way level in any direction but I can get this adjusted so the sel close mech works and five minutes later it is back to being a non self close gate. Other than that, it's a decent baby gate but I imagine if you are buying this it's for the self closing..."
4,Wonderful Story!,Catherine Cookson at her best. Oppression and a hard-scrabble life turns ultimately to triumph for 'The Girl' in this memorable and unforgettably poignant story.
3,"Big Hit, Uneven Album","Hall and Oates were, first and foremost, a singles band whose studio albums were often of secondary importance. The one exception was 1980's ""Voices,"" which contained several excellent tracks beyond the obvious hits. With 1981's ""Private Eyes,"" however, it was back to business as usual. The title song was the biggest hit on this album and one of the duo's all time best. Up against ... contempraries such as Duran Duran and Culture Club, it was a breath of fresh air on the radio at the time.""I Can't Go for That"" was also a big hit, while ""Did it in a Minute"" and ""Your Imagination"" (deservedly) scored some airplay as well. Beyond that is mostly filler material recommended only for diehard H&O; fans. It should also be noted that the CD for this album contains no CD booklet, only a single page that repeats the back cover.Overall, an unveven period piece that has more than its fair share of decent singles."
3,I CAN go for that...,"Continuing their comeback from a late 70's slump/rut, the duo follows up the success of Voices with this smash LP, their highest charting album to date (#5 on the Hot 100). Private Eyes yields two #1's (the title track and ""I Can't Go For That (No Can Do)""), plus the top ten ""Did It In A Minute"". While the title song sounds simliar to ""Kiss On My List"" from the previous album, ""I Can't Go for That"" has a unique R&B flavor to it and would become a hallmark track for H2O (get it...""Hall""-mark!). The album (what we used to call it) does have some weak tracks, as most do, but with the full-length version of ""Can't Go For That"", two bonifide hits, plus the catchy ""Your Imagination"", it's basically a solid album overall. Also, as recording technolgy improved year by year, we hear a cleaner, sharper sound in this collection...something which would only keep expanding with each album (louder snare drum). Incidentally, I possess TWO copies of this LP on vinyl. - Fred"

3,pretty good,i have always dug Hall&Oats I can't go for that (no can do)the title cut& Your Imagination were the cuts.they have feeling in there music which is the most important thing to me.now some things are dated but overall it's pretty good.check out their Manager at the time? he is now the President of Sony Music.they are Soulful much Like Steely DAn.
4,Hall & Oates' Best Album,"These guys made some of the most infectious music of the '80s, and this CD represents the cream of the crop. Many race-obsessed critics tried to dismiss them as white poseurs trying to play ""black"" music, but Hall & Oates were able to overcome such small-minded bigotry and prove that music knows no color. More genuine ""soul"" than a dozen pretenders who just happen to be black (e.g., New Edition, Boyz II Men, etc.)."
4,Private Eyes Review,"When I opened the mailing package and saw the CD case,the first thing that came to my mind was, ""This thing is scuffed up a bit."" There were scuffs and a crack which had besieged the case.Although it seems as if the case had been around the block and back, the actual disc itself is perfectly fine and plays great. And in the end that's all that matters."
5,The album that made the duo a radio staple for life.,"It is easy to understand why Hall and Oates never achieved the success they did in the 80's in the 70's because they could not figure out if they should go commercial or artistic. Although this album had five hits it still made the listeners think of them as the saviours of pop rather than the replacements for The Jackson Five. Check out ""Did It In A Minute"", ""Your Imagination"" and"" Mano A Mano"".."
4,Simple and clear,"This is a very nice collection of traditional carols that make it easy for children to sing along with, and simple for adults to teach and follow along. It doesn't have the pizazz of new, contemporary sounds, but we found it a nice change and the kids enjoyed it when we sang along during the month of December in Sunday School."
4,Nice traditional Christmas CD,"This CD has a decent selection of traditional Christmas hymns. I wanted our kids to learn some of th basics - Joy to the World, Away in a Manger, etc - and this worked well for that."
3,Parody on Parody,"A rather parody on Alien Authopsy documentary, this comedy is the easy-watching during the Season."
2,Beware False info,This candle is featured to be a 60 hour candle...however when the package arrived it reads that it is a 50 hour candle.
4,Grave of a Ghost,"Elena Santangelo's HANG MY HEAD AND CRY, the sequel to BY BLOOD POSSESSED will have ghost hunters finding membership in her fan club. I have not, at this date, read the first of the series. But HANG MY HEAD AND CRY has plenty of strength to stand alone.Pat Montella is an Italian-American heir to the Virginia home of Miss Maggie Shelby. Together they are an engaging pair of amateur sleuths who zero in on a dual-case. The skeletal remains that turn up in Pat's garden and some current murders to keep the story hopping. The intricate details of post Civil War Virginia makes fascinating reading. The ghosts are real with more substance than a cold breeze, Pat's ability to step into the past will keep you reading through the summer heat.Writing as a Small BusinessSins of the Fathers: A Brewster County NovelUnder the Liberty Oak"
4,ABBALICIOUS!,"O.K., O.K. -- I admit it; I loved Abba as a kid and ""Mama Mia"" was my first taste of that sweet Swedish confection. So I'm biased. After hearing this high energy cover version at the club I had to have it and was delighted to find it at this reduced price for a EU import. Once again, Abbacadabra proves it's damn near impossible to kill a pop classic if you remain faithful to the original melody & lyrics. Mama Mary's 12"" mix bounces along on a sugar high for almost seven minutes -- and the Definitive mix is another slice of heaven clocking in at 7:47. Yummy. Guaranteed to pack clubfloors."
4,A pretty neat song,The song Mama Mia was pretty neat to listen too. And it is also a very dancebel tune. The rest of the cd is pretty good too.
3,"Good, but for beginners only.","This book explains PLCs in terms of Allen Bradley PLCs. It is targeted at people that have never used a PLC before and does a good job of explaining the fundamentals of PLCs. If you are in this group, I would strongly recommend this book. However, it is not very helpful if you are already familiar with PLCs and are looking to learn about Allen Bradley products as much of the book concerns things such as what kind of devices are connected to PLCs, good installation practices, etc."
4,"Good, not great","Like others, I recommend this to be a part of the library in any maintenance and engineering department that is responsible for Rockwell-based automation systems. It's a good overview and should be helpful in a mixed environment.It is not a textbook and advanced programming techniques but should help you understand the use of data files, file instructions, indirect addressing, IO structure and data structures.There is probably never going to be a single book that covers the whole gambit, but this is about as close as you are likely to get with the AB platforms."
2,warning to network admins,"If you plan to install this printer on a network, think twice. Using the latest driver and built-in NIC, even on a fast switched network, you will probably not get the rated 'time-to-first-page' performance. As print jobs are processed at the workstation (no PCL emulation), the time needed for the data to leave the queue and get to the printer can mean an inconvenient wait standing at the printer to grab your pages. Evidently, Oki has known about this for some time.I gave 2 stars as the web-mgmt interface is pretty good."
4,Good shoe,"Is a good, secure shoe that you could flip flop around in easily. I ended up returning as i just didn't need another pair. The danger of impulse-buying."
2,Don't really like this sandal,I don't like the fit of the sandal around the toe. Maybe I have a big toe but it is just too snug.
5,"Great fit, very comfortable","These are very comfortable and easy to wear. Like being bearfooted, but with supportive arch and cushion."
5,total comfort,Due to my weight and the fact I'm constantly on my feet shoes are critical. I find these to give me total support while alowing my feet to feel free.
4,Mega blocks Pirates of the Carribean,Product arrived in good time and is enjoyed by the 9 yr old who received as a gift.
4,Good basic metric hex key set...,"This is a good tool for your portable took kit. Nice fit and finish overall. Size markers on the case are very small and the same yellow color: this is a minor gripe.For a standing work bench, I might consider other options, but this is a good choice when working away from the place you store your tools."
2,Good to have but watch out,"As any good handy man knows, you need to have allen keys/hex keys whatever you want to call then, in your tool box. I bought these about a year and a half ago and the bolts that hold them together had fallen apart. After using them time after time, you have to make sure that the bolts holding these keys together are tight or they will come loose and it is very, did I mention very, very easy to lose. I repaired both sets after losing the nuts to the bolts by putting a tie wrap/zip tie through the hole where the bolt goes. Walla, problem solved, now I dont have to worry about losing they keys anymore. I do like the grip though. You just have to watch with those small bolts that hold this thing together."
3,Does the job for the right price.,"Decent product and has the most common, but not all, Allen wenches in one small neat product. You dont have to worry about losing one either. However it isn't perfect turning and using it is a little cumbersome. It's hard to explain but i will say it will take longer to screw or unscrew then using other individual Allen wenches. It's not perfect but considering the price and the fact u get 2 of them, why complain?"
4,A Beautiful Brute,"Pleasing to look at -- nice to have handy because (almost) all the hex keys you need are now in one place. Might be a little hard to use in some tight places, however. This is metric but some metric sizes are comparable to their American equivalents."
1,ES MALISIMO,"Compre uno hace unos meses , y es fatal no hay una herramienta stanley que me allá servido es solo fama y marca , hace tiempo no compro nada de ellos , prefiero trupper , es fantástico, este juego de allen, es malisimo , se parten , se doblan , es muy grande y no entra en espacios pequeños , en fin fatal compra"
5,Great book,I bought this for my son for his birthday and he couldn't put it down. I am so pleased.Thanks
1,Money thrown out!,"I bought this product based in some good reviews, but, really, it doesn't work. Doesn't hydrate the cuticles. I bought, try use many times a day for many days, and nothing was better.Don't buy it!"
2,Much better options out there,"My nails are brittle and break easy. I like trying new things, but this was not a good option. I liked the apricot smell, but the cream didn't really absorb into my nails, they kind of got moisturized, but not protected, and definitely not as good as other brands I have tried. I would recommend Solar Oil or Burt's Bees Lemon Cuticle cream. I even like Lip Smackers Bubble gum flavor lip balm for my nails - it is super cheap, rubs in quickly, and gives a beautiful shine. It may sound weird but it works!"
4,Nice Product,I feel like the cuticle product works pretty well. It works better than hand lotion alone. I use it before bed at night and the next day my cuticles and nails look healthier and more moisturized. I'm not a fan of the little tub because I always get the product stuck under my nail as I put my finger in to scoop the cream out. I like the thickness of the cream and it gets softer as I rub it into my nails. Definitely a good product for the price.
2,Very disappointed,"I am trying to find a good cuticle cream. I have tough cuticles, and this product did nothing. I'm still looking for a good cream."
4,not bad,"We love this even though it does leak. Cleaned it ,tightened the screws ect..Still leaks. So, we have a few cups and then transfer the coffee over to our Stanley thermos.(which actually keeps it piping hot all night!) Since you can't slide it easily I put it on one of those plexiglass cutting boards and it slides just fine. I wish I could order a new coffee tank. It is kinda hard to fill since it is hard to see the levels inside the tank so I have a jug marked to the correct water level and use it fill up the tank. I know I shouldn't have to do all this extra to make coffee but what the hey it's not gonna kill me to do it.Too bad they won't fix that leaking problem. It is a great idea."
5,No more spills!,"We first encountered a coffee maker like this at a bed and breakfast and thought it was a great idea. It is nice to set your coffee maker at night for the next morning and not have to wonder if you'll find coffee all over the floor (due to not having the coffee pot under the filter just so). There is also no mess when pouring coffee. Just place your cup under it! Also keeps coffee very hot for long time without that ""cooked"" taste. Very satisfied!"
1,Leaks and have to use the microwave poor customer service,"This is the 3rd purchase of this product. They wear out very fast. Coffee is lukewarm when first brewed and must be heated in the microwave. It does get warmer after 30 minutes but defeats the purpose of fresh hot brewed coffee. It does leak and is hard to fill. Customer service answer to the the problem? ""We will document your complaint."" ""Sorry for the inconvenience."""
3,Hamilton Brew Station,"Makes great coffee and the self contained holding tank is great. The only issues I have, one is my oversite, but the fact that it is almost impossible to see or tell how much coffee remains in the uniy is an issue. The other oversite, is most other coffee makers all have clockes and timers these days. I overlooked the fact that there is not one on this model. I just bought an external timer, but it still needs to be pointed out better in the sales descripition."
2,Hamilton Beach Model 47665 Brew Station 12 Cup,"After 7 months of daily usage(and carefully following the 30-day cleaning instructions) the tank filter became blocked with coffee scum. This is a fine mesh filter that cannot be cleaned, cannot be removed, and rendered the Brew Station useless. No doubt this works for occasional usage but it is not practical for brewing morning coffee every day."
2,I have had better,"Unable to see the water line clearly plus, after a short period of time, it will start leaking. Hamilton Beach does not stand behind their product and they are hard to contact/work with. Very arrogant representative. Bought a Keurig. Expensive but it works great!"
1,Toxic Brew!!!!,"Regardless of how often and well you clean this coffeemaker, be prepared for the coffee to taste like plastic. In fact, my mouth had a constant plastic/chemical taste in it after drinking from this coffee maker. Back to the percolator!"
4,Perkin' Right Along,"This brewstation is so easy to use! No carafe is involved - just push a coffee mug or cup under the spout, and your coffee pours right in. The coffee maker holds enough for 12 cups and is easy to fill. It can be programmed to brew automatically so that your coffee is ready when you get up in the morning. Of all the coffee makers I have used over the years, this is the best one ever. So why four stars instead of five? The little measuring spoon is ""optional"" on this model. For goodness sakes, why not provide this on all models? How cheap is that? I first saw the coffee maker at a friend's house; her model had the spoon included. Otherwise, a super buy!"
3,Disappointed,"I purchased the Hamilton Beach BrewStation 10-18-07. I liked the concept of ""touch-n-pour"". This product cleans very easily. The programable feature is easy to use. Disappointed that the coffee is only luke warm. You don't need to bother blowing and slurping those first few sips. Also, It started leaking this week."
4,Hamilton Beach 12 Cup Coffee Maker,I just bought this Hamilton Beach 12 cup coffe maker to replace an old coffe pot at work. I've only had it a few weeks and we all love it! It makes a great cup of coffee. The machine also keeps the coffe nice and Hot! The only thing I'm not thrilled with is the automatic shut off. It shuts off automatically after two hours. I wish that I could adjust the length of time the coffee maker stays on.
1,Pumpless,This is my second and last one. Both unit will not pump all the water out of the water container. I will be looking for a better unit. The first one lasted about ten months and the last one lasted about three months. I was going to ask if their was a solution for this then what I got was pay $15 and we will have our experts tell you about a fix if possible. No Thanks.
3,Returned,"Well, the positive is the coffee was very hot and tasty. The negative was the noise it made during dispensing and that once it turned off, dispenser wouldn't work. I'd have to turn it back on and let it warm up before dispensing would work. Otherwise, I'd have to remove the resevoir and pour manually, which entailed unlocking the top part and pouring out. I was bummed! I've already returned it and now seeking something else."
4,LOVE IT!,"I bought this as a gift for my mom because I own one and love it! The only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars is that it is hard to read the water indicator when measuring water due to the black background. I solved this, though, by turning the container around facing a window or light so I can see how much water I am adding (not sure if that makes sense). This keeps the coffee warm, easy to dispense and I LOVE that I can fill large mugs!"
4,Hamilton Beach Brewstation,"This is my second coffee maker of this type from Hamilton Beach. A couple of improvements, but some leakage in the front dispenser when brewing makes it less than perfect."
1,"Leaky, leaky, leaky","This is the second one I have bought. I had hoped with all the bad reviews they had fixed the problem and the second one wouldn't leak. I really loved this coffee maker except for the constant dribbling. I put up with it until I found my entire counter flooded one morning. I hate going back to a carafe and I will miss my Brewstation when it worked good, but neither of them lasted much more than 6 months. I wrote to Hamilton Beach and complained and I never got a reply back. I will not buy a Hamilton Beach product again."
1,Nice concept; bad design,I would not recommend this to anyone. It started leaking after only two days and continued leaking even after following the cleaning instructions. Couldn't return it either b/c the packaging was tossed. This went priduct went straight to the garbage and I bought a Mr. Coffee carafe-less...it uses a pump instead of gravity like the HB. Dont waste your money!!
2,Starts leaking after about 6 months,"I loved the convenience of my Hamilton Beach Brewstation; but I won't buy another one of them. I have owned 2 of them (one was this model; and the other was a slightly taller model that can accomodate a travel mug). In both cases, the pot started leaking badly after only 6 months of use. Considering the cost, they should last longer than 6 months before going into the trash."
5,Great Coffee Maker,"I am really impressed with this coffee maker easy to use, easy to clean and wow is the coffee piping hot even as it shuts down automatically. Definitely two thumbs up."
4,Good coffee,"This is a good coffee maker and easy to operate and make coffee. The cost is very reasonable and does not ""beep""!!! Coffee comes out just a little close to the cup!!"
3,coffeemaker,"really like this coffeemaker...had to send 1st one back for replacement cause the valve dripped continually after filling cup... 2nd one works fine,,,so far. other than that a real nice product..."
2,9-MONTH LIFESPAN,"After only 9 months, the coffee maker developed a drip that floods my counter. The drip comes from the mechanism that opens and closes to release coffee for which there are no replacement parts. The warranty is worthless because I would have to pay shipping costs to and from Hamilton Beach. The solution - for the cost of postage, I have a new Mr Coffee...... DISAPPOINTED"
2,Nice idea but poorly built,Purchased this coffee maker at a retailer last March. The markings for number of cups is very hard to see and it is very difficult to pour the water into the coffee maker because of limited space on the top. As of today it is going in the trash because the container for the brewed coffee is leaking thru the bottom. Would not buy again.
4,Get this model 47665,"Get this model rather than the new improved models which are problematic. We liked this one so well we got a model 48464, which is terrible, leaks and the lever is improperly designed.Back to the 47665, it's reliable, fast [much faster than the Cuisinarts] and easy to use."
5,Great coffeemaker!,This is the best coffeemaker I ever used. I would highly recommend it to anyone who really enjoys a great cup of coffee.Hamilton Beach 47665 BrewStation Plus 12-Cup Automatic Drip Coffeemaker
4,Much improved,Our old Brewstation (we use it at the office) made okay coffee (at best) but started leaking 9 months in. We used to have to lay out a ton of paper towels each morning before starting the coffee. The new version seems to be of slightly higher quality and the coffee tastes a little better. Hopefully no leaks this time...
1,A company without knowledge of quality assurance!,"My particular dissatisfaction is with the Model 47686. Leaks from day one getting progressively worse as time went by. In all fairness, the brew station made exceptional coffee...........if you didn't mind cleaning up the mess on a daily basis. Tried all methods of troubleshooting and then read the reviews on Amazon.com to discover everyone who purchased the BrewStation had the same or similar problems. Great concept...Poor product!"
1,"Great idea, but..","Flaws: doesn't brew hot enough, took months to get rid of plastic taste (yuck), has leaked coffee all over the counter since it was two months old. Also you have to submerge it & weight it down while jamming something into the spout to keep it open where the coffee flows out to clean it.Yes, it still works after two years, but you have to remove the hot grinds and then pour from the reservoir to get a cup of coffee. Not what i want to be doing at 6AM.I do use freshly ground beans and have hard water so maybe that's part of the problem. But regardless I am searching for a replacement."
5,I say buy it,"It's hard to change coffee makers when your happy with the one you think makes a great cup,so when my wife changed my sacred coffee maker with this one I was real skepticle and not real happy !!!!!! What a pleasent surprise....I love this coffee maker and have since recommended this maker highly. Enjoy."
3,I loved it until I hated it,"The coffee maker did fairly well for me for about a good year or so. I loved just being able to get a cup at a time of coffee and no canter to break or deal with. I think keeping it clean regularly helped it last longer but one day the coffee was on my counter and no longer in the reserve - I thought maybe I hadn't hooked the thing up right but after that, it just kept leaking out on the counter and not staying in the maker - Still never figured out where it was leaking from either. I did love it until it broke down and made the mess but I think the innovative idea behind this was on the right track. Hopefully the company will work the bugs out and make it better."
2,Misleading,"I had the same problem as the last review. Not the same items as purchased. Not nearly as nice as the one shown. Not at all the same as the one shown. Do not purchase from Amazon this coffee maker, try somewhere else to get what you purchase."
2,Works well at first,"The overall concept on this is certainly quite convenient. However now I have to clean the rubber gasket every few months (which is a pain to get to), or it leaks coffee everywhere. As other reviewers have stated, the coffee is not always terribly hot right out of the pot. Good design, poor implementation."
4,Pottless!,"This is one of the best coffee makers I have owned. My only issue is with the fill lines inside. When your filling the water they are hard to see. Other than that, I am very satisfied and would recommend to anyone tired of the pot, no bleaching or cleaning or cracking or breaking, its great!"
2,great design but............bad tasting coffee,"I love the design of this coffeemaker. I was glad to not have a glass carafe to deal with (and break)... that is until I tasted the coffee from the Brewmaster if it had been in the coffeemaker more than 1 - 2 hours.Because the brewed coffee is housed in a plastic compartment (as opposed to glass), the hot beverage seemed to take on the taste of the heated plastic from the coffee maker. Over time, it got worse.This would be a great product if the unit had an inert material as the liner for the coffee compartment."
3,"Nice concept, imperfect construction","We love that this coffee maker does not require a carafe, it is nice for our small kitchen to have one less item in the sink. We like the coffee that it makes and it is easy to use, plus it takes standard filters. The downfall is that after a year or so the unit started leaking. We cannot quite nail down the spot and we have spent too much time cleaning up after the machine. We are currently looking for something similar to replace it."
4,Hamilton Beach Coffee maker from Amazon,Level indicator on coffee pot leaves a lot to be desired. There should have been internal markings on coffee container to clearly show the correct amount of water to add. i have found the best solution is to use a cup and add water in this manner to make adequate coffee.
5,BREW STATION REVIEW,"EXCELLENT PRODUCT. THIS IS OUR 2ND. ONE,, THE FIRST LASTED SEVERAL YEARS BUT FINALLY GAVE OUT. THIS IS THE ONLY BREW STATION WE WILL EVER OWN. WE LOVE IT !!"
1,DO NOT BUY-Spend the money for the Brewstation Deluxe Instead!!,"This is really the hardest coffee pot to pour water into the reserviour, not lying whatsoever. It also gives the coffee a plastic taste to it and that can't be good for your body at all. I don't know how people actually like this brewstation. Spend a little extra and get yourself the Brewstation Deluxe. I had one for 5 years and then it started leaking BUT 5 years is pretty good for a coffee maker that got daily use, sometimes 2 times a day I think. I decided to save some money here and downgrade, worse decision ever. Not only did this one horribly stink, I have now wasted money on return shipping. I will be purchasing another Brewstation Deluxe, the one that comes with the permanent filter. They sell a $50 one that uses throw away filters also."
3,Reliable but don't EVER look under the top cover,"We have had an earlier model for years now and it has been very reliable, however there is one thing that you should consider. We are very good about cleaning our coffee maker but with this one coffee gets in places it will never come out without breaking the machine. Somehow coffee in the filter splashes back up into the outlet in the top cover. We have taken the top off and soaked it which helped some, but there are large clumps of ground coffee that are there to stay. Other than this issue the coffee maker has been perfect but we will not be purchasing another."
4,No more expensive replacements!,"First Hamilton Beach we have purchased. We have used it 3 times, so far so good. No drips, no leaks, coffe is hot and steaming but not burning your mouth. No glassware to break! (By the way that's why we purchased a new coffee maker) Timer, automatic shut off, easy to use........So far we love it. Nice upgrade."
5,Wonderful Surprise,I ordered the Hamilton Beech Coffemaker for our daughter-in-law's birthday in December. This is an item we own and she had one without the timer. She wanted the one with the timer so I odered this and was surprised to receive it within a couple of days. It was even nicer than ours and the price was excellent. We had shopped around and your price was the best by far. We learned our lesson about checking Amazon.com the next time we have shopping to do. Thanks for such great service.
3,H B BrewStation,would have given it a higher rating if I could tell how much is left. Supposed to be able to. But keeps coffee hot with no biter taste!!
5,The Perfect Coffee Maker,"I have had the Hamilton Beach BrewStation for years. Every time I need a new coffee maker, I choose the version of the Hamilton Beach that is on the market at the time. I love having the ""hands free"" way of pouring coffee. Its easy to use, easy to clean and there is no glass coffee pot to break, discolor or have that gross burnt coffee flavor and smell after its been sitting for a while. The BrewStation does not burn and always tastes fresh."
4,Brewstation,This is a great product!! Not having a carafe is the way to go! A little bigger than some other makers...but great product.
1,Less than 1 year old & LEAKING!!! :(,"We purchased this model because of the updated design (no pot and added features). We thought with the updates they would have fixed the leaking problem. Well, for the first 8 months, no problems what-so-ever! Then, we come home from church to find coffee all over our counter and floor! This model is leaking as well! We've only followed direction for cleaning - never did anything outside of the provided care instructions and, this happens in less than a year? I wouldn't suggest this model to anyone! :("
5,Good Hot Coffee,"No more broken carafes. Coffee is hot enough for our use for the 2 hour ""on"" period. No leaks. I tried to tighten all screws before our use, based on previous comments of reviewer. All screws were tight from the factory. Delivery was about 4 days after doing the on-line order. Yes, I would buy this item again."
1,Junk,Another piece of junk that doesn't last 6 mos. Nice concept but apparently the gasket comes loose and you have a complete mess all over your counter. Replacing the rubber gasket is next to impossible as it requires special tools to open the area where the gasket is. A little bit of better planning on the manufacturers part would make a big difference. Don't waste your money.
5,Love it,"Love it, Love it, Love it. The best coffee you'll ever have.After 7 years my 1st brew station finally called it quits.So I bought another Brew Station, of course. Cannotbe without my Brew Station. Try it you'll see."
4,Not quite as good as last model but still great,"This is my third or fourth brewstation; last one worked for over 5 years. I love not having a carafe, the program options and all the other options.Compared to the last model I had, this one is harder to fill (spills are more frequent) and the numbers or fill line is really, really hard to see...hard to guage the water level and even the coffee level. Actually only easy to see once the heat makes the water/coffee ""bead""--then you can see it.These small items are nothing against the convenence and awesomeness of the Brewstation. I have never had the leakage issues I read in other reviews. My second one did die in just a year for no known reason, but still...i did continue to buy them & do not regret."
1,Great coffee maker for one year!,"I thought this coffee maker was the greatest. Yes, it had some flaws, but overall we loved it. (Pouring water into the reservoir in the back of it can be a little tricky and some often ends up on your counter) I have it just over one year and there is a leak inside from the tank where the coffee is deposited after brewing. What a mess this produces. It's a shame that this product had such a short life. I would not recommend it on this basis."
2,Turns off automatically after one cup.,"My Brewmaster makes great coffee and we enjoyed it for three months but is now a total nuisance to use. It turns off automatically after one cup. You have to keep hitting the ""on"" button again and you can imagine how frustrating that is. Customer service said it was out of warranty.I wouldn't buy another Hamilton Beach product."
2,Leaks Leaks and More Leaks,"I really thought this was the perfect product. I especially loved the idea of having no carafe. However, after having this product for about 3 months, I started to notice that it would leak...occasionally. Now it leaks every time I try to use it. I would not recommend anyone get this product. Although the concept is nice, the problems aren't worth the hassle."
3,BrewStation Coffeemaker,"Overall, the coffeemaker is easy to use and makes a good cup of coffee. However, it is difficult to see the water level markings and it is also difficult to dump the water into the reservoir without spilling it on the counter."
3,Worked great...For a while.,"We bought this about a year and a half ago and it seemed like a great idea until the pouring mechanism gave out on us. It began pouring slower and slower, so my husband gave the whole thinga good cleaning only to find out that the plastic button that pushes forward to release the coffee was wearing down. It's now at the point that it would take most of the morning to pour a cup of coffee from the trickle it now gives and we have resorted to just opening the top and pouring the coffee out of the inside bucket which is A.) Messy and B.) Dangerous since someone could easily get burned. I have tried a few tricks trying to build the plastic button up, but it only works for one or two cups of coffee and then needs to be fixed again. I will purchase a coffee maker with a pot next time. I will say that this coffee maker was great while it lasted though...."
2,"Could not relate, did not help","The first chapter described almost exactly how I feel when I fly. However, in the very next chapter, the character(who like me was terrified to fly), was suddenly obsessed with becoming a pilot! WHAT? I could NOT relate, infact, it was such an absurd and extraordiary jump that I couldn't even finish the book. I needed facts and tools, not an unrealistic story. I also purcased ""Flying Without Fear"" and that book is exactly what I needed."
4,Not just a children's book!,"What an enjoyable read! A friend of mine recommended that I read this 'cross over' book (meant for readers 14 thru adult). Each story is superbly written and could stand on its own. In fact, I would like to see Ms. Lewis expand the shorts to novels for each memorable character!"
2,Too simplistic,"I was a bit disappointed in this book-it was written as if Israeli children were writing letters to American students. I felt like it was talking down to the kids. It does cover some important information and for younger children it may be very good, but does not meet my needs in teaching to the intermediate students. The photos are in black and white and it has illustrations. I did like some of the activities included in the book which I may use with the 10-12 year olds. Also, the book was published in 1978 and a lot has changed since then, making some of the information on current day life incorrect."
3,Chintzy but works,"This is a really cheap set but for the price, it enabled me to get up and going quickly with my new grinder. As the items wear I will probably replace with better quality products. The case is very flimsy."
1,This book is a total Deceit,"This is probably one of the worst books I have ever read.All the arguments and points raised by Harun have beenrebuked and solidly proven wrong by scientists suchas Richard Dawkins.Scientists are sceptical to start of with even withtheir own theories. The fact that Darwin did not publishhis Origins for 20 years because he had to think hardabout the revolutionary idea, and come up with weaknessesin his ideas is twisted by Harun to trivialize Darwin'smental abilities.Harun's quoting from scientists are all out of context,and he takes great pleasure to fish out the singlesentence from some scientists work which has a hint ofdoubt regarding the validity of evolution. As a responsiblewriter, he should quote in context by quoting the entirepassage or not quote at all.Reading this book is frustrating and annoying.Please do not buy it...if you really want answers,get 'The Blind Watchmaker' by Dawkins, and you will bepleasantly enlightened."
5,Good Job!,This is an invitation!I invite the people who believes and supports the theory of evolution to read this book.You will find the answers of all your questions without any doubt.You will learn how we have been tricked.
2,"Interesting content, sloppy code examples","Even though the content of the book is very intriguing, and provides a clear introduction to the XML technologies (XML, SAX, DOM etc.) most of the Java code in the book does not even compile. The errors some times are deeper than mere typographical errors, e.g. void member methods later on called with the expectation to return a rather complicated Tree object etc. Too bad, because together with the attempt to use standard design patterns in java code dealing with XML, it could have been indeed an excellent book."
3,Not very Good,"First of all this book has lots of Errors in printing and the supporting web-site of the author is down since i bought this book,the Cd also does not have all the Codes and upto dates APIs.It seems that author does not want to give complete knowledge to its readers.It seems i have to read another XML book to read this book.it does not cover the topics in details."
1,How not to write a book.,"I read this book about this over hyped technology as XML. Please, stop writing books, you are confussing begginers, and making experts cry."
4,Vintage all American Fiedler...,"The 4 star rating is primarily due to the attractive compositionsgrouped on this one disc, by six great American composers. The remastered recording quality is variable with the ""Grand CanyonSuite"" and ""Cuban Overture"" sounding best. The recording dates range from 1958-1964. On Gould's ""American Salute"" Fiedler conducts atbreak neck speed; I think missing some detail. The ""Fancy Free"" dances are too brief and are probably included as filler. All in all this recording is dated and their are better versions available of all these pieces. Anyway, at a bargain price this is a nice way to spend seventy minutes relaxing. Subtract 1 starif recorded sound is all important to you!"
4,Nice Sunday Concert,"This is a nice Sunday afternoon concert played by a wonderful orchestra with a late, lamented leasder, maestro Fiedler.Please understand that this is not patriotic music per se, but rather a collection of tunes about America or by prominent American composers--which means the title is a bit misleading, even though Gould's American Salute is the title track.Still, for those who don't know much about the American concert repertoire, this is a nice album. I especially enjoy the Grand Canyon Suite and so too will anyone who's seen it with his own eyes."
4,Classic synth sounds!,"Touch is another synthpop masterpiece by Eurythmics that has stood the test of time very well. Not quite on the level of Sweet Dreams, it nevertheless contains brilliant songs like the atmospheric Here Comes The Rain Again with its evocative lyric, the compelling Right By Your Side with its riveting reggae beat and the soulful Who's That Girl. The arrangements are innovative throughout and lend merit even to the lesser songs like Regrets with its frisky trumpets. Another favorite of mine is Paint A Rumour with its skittering beat and subtle synth flourishes - it really grows on you. On Touch, Eurythmics consolidated the sound they introduced on Sweet Dreams, before they veered off into new directions with 1985's Be Yourself Tonight and the following year's Revenge. It remains a synth-pop classic."
3,Interesting....Kind of....,"OK, I just finished this book last p.m. I thought it was an interesting premise but I just dont find it believable. I mean, come on, a killer who knows exactly where and when a tornado is going to strike? I thought the murderer was an obvious suspect from the get go and he was virtually ignored as a suspect until the conclusion of the book. I thought the romantic portion was forced and contrived. I did like the adolescent turmoil and father/daughter relationship. That seemed real to me... Overall, so-so. There are much stronger reads out there."
3,Could have been better,"The book sounded like it had a very interesting premise, but, in the end, it was a little disappointing. It was a fast read, but there was not enough about the motivations of the killer. If the author would have spent a little longer on that arc, then the fast-paced ending would not have seemed so premature. I would certainly recommend this book for light reading."
1,Totally Implausible.,"This was one of the silliest books I've ever read. A completely implausible plot with dull characters. I had the murderer pegged the moment he entered the story. And what is with these female authors who portray teenage girls like they're complete morons. I can't tell you the number of books I've read with a teenage girl who is essentially good at heart, but doesn't she just have to fall for the ""bad boy"" her usually single/widowed parent doesn't like? And while we're at it let's have her have sex with him (yawn). Also, I cannot figure out the presence of Willa in this story. Other than being a somewhat boring love interest, she served absolutely no purpose. I think I should learn to avoid these TV ""Book Club"" books. More often than not they're complete disappointments."
1,...,"its horrible, the characters are corny and sterotypical..she lacks any all research to this book even remotely believeable.. I've chased storms for years, Twister was more accurate than this.. I've read books for years too and she sucks when it comes to evidence collection and anything else.. The mistakes were so numerous that you could hardly get through the book, it was so unreal and unbelievable that you almost had to laugh at how stupid it was.... Warner books should be ashamed and embarrassed to think they could trick the public with hype to cover up a horrible horrible book.. This should have never been published at all...."
1,You have got to be kidding me,"The writer took a great idea and destroyed it. In a story that is so unbelievable its funny. Her weather and crime scene knowledge and research is non existant. This book is so far out there its not believable at all. She writes in characters into this book that leave you wondering just what their purpose is. This is 1st grade story telling at best. Nothing is tied together and the way this book jumps around its impossible to form a picture in your head. I could barely finish this book it was so horrible. What she did to this book is criminal and whomever at Warner books approved the publishing of this book should be fired. To say a book like this is great is a slap in the face to all the great authors out there like Patricia Cornwell, Iris Johansen, Kay Hooper, Dean Koonz etc. Don't lower your standards.Pass this one up, its not worth the paper its written on."
2,Bore-maker,"I am giving this book 2 stars only because it kept me mildly entertained today while I was sitting in the hospital waiting room. Otherwise, this book is terrible. If you really want to read a book by Alice Blanchard, get ""Darkness Peering"" it is excellent. I don't think the same Alice Blanchard wrote ""Breathtaker."""
2,Completely unbelievable,"This book was a huge disappointment. It starts as a gripping story and a real page-turner; it ends up being completely unbelievable and implausible. There is no real suspense here, it is easy to guess who is committing the murders and the ending is completely ridiculous."
5,Awesome!,I've been anxiously awaiting Alice Blanchard's next book since reading Darkness Peering several years ago. The Breathtaker certainly doesn't disappoint! I couldn't put it down.
5,AWESOME!,"What a great book! I loved ""Darkness Peering"" so much and I was afraid this would be a disappointment like most sophomore efforts are. But this was a great, great story. First, what a great idea for a book or movie... the killer using tornados to cover his brutal murders. Charlie the sheriff is smart and compassionate... a great mix of a guy you believe is capable to handle the case, but like you might be in the same situation, too. The ending is fast and furious until the climax, which does not disappoint. Five stars. I'm going to read it again."
3,"Fast-paced, eerie thriller","A disturbed killer is on the loose. He manages to predict tornadoes with astonishing accuracy as a precursor to picking his victims. Charlie Grover is the police chief of Promise, Oklahoma, and a single father. Charlie struggles with his daughter finding her first love. He himself re-discovers what love feels like. He is relentless in his pursuit to find the killer. His case takes him to Texas and other locations in Oklahoma, and Kansas. The author does well to keep the true identity of the killer hidden until the very end. Good action but the editing mistakes drag it down."
3,"Great concept, overdone writing style","As a fan of murder mysteries and someone who's always been in awe of the power of tornadoes, this seemed like a super concept for a novel. At last, something not done to death by repetition! I enjoyed the basic flow of the book and plot very much, however I found Blanchard's simile-laden style began to grate very quickly. The writing fairly screamed 'movie treatment'; somehow everything is just too over-described and wordy: ""At the damage site, people stood around in amazement in the freezing-ass rain, while a pea-soup fog tinted with the fiery glow of the strobing emergency lights..."" and so on and so on. She uses so many similes (""it sounded like a hundred helicopters"") that after a while I started to groan when the next 'like' or 'as if' made its all-too-predictable appearance.Overall a great concept, but writing not quite polished enough to feel truly effortless or professional for me."
2,Good premise but poorly done,"The plot has a lot of potential, but I found the piece poorly done. Limited character development, weak descriptions, and a plot that felt incomplete made this work disappointing. I feel the author would benefit from reading a higher quality literature for helpful examples in future writings."
4,Serial Killer + Twister = Exciting!,"I really enjoyed the premise of this murder mystery (a mash-up of a standard serial killer story and the drama of the movieTwister). Blanchard's plot was well drawn-out with plenty of suspense and tension - and even the killer's identity surprised me! Blanchard included some pretty intense gore and rather grotesque images, but it worked well within the framework of violence from both nature and man. I liked this melding story a lot - and I was intrigued enough to buy one of her other mysteries,Darkness Peering. I am curious to see how it will be!"
2,Just Okay,"There were good things about this book, and there were bad things. First of all, I found it very distracting that all of the characters were motherless. Every one of them. Was there a point to that? I don't think so, I think it was just bad character development. Too many of the characters were the same, the former football player cops, the child abuse suffered by more than one character. It also didn't ring true that Charlie would be so quick to forgive his father for the abuse he suffered.I thought the murders and the mystery were interesting, and quite frightening, Alice Blanchard did a good job with that. But all in all, not a great book, I'm not even sure I would recommend it to friends."
3,Solid But Not Spectacular,"This album has some solid songs but there's nothing on here that will blow you away. Brun's style is reminiscent of the milder songs of Emiliana Torrini, Frou Frou, or Imogen Heap. She also incorporates a more country music influenced style than the artists mentioned previously. If you really love those artists' albums, then Brun's should be right up your alley. However this album lacked any real punch and even on my most melancholy days, I still find this album to be kinda dull. Don't get me wrong, the album is not a total bust but it also doesn't get heavy rotation in my CD player.If you're interested, the two songs I recommend are ""Balloon Ranger"" and ""Song No. 6"" featuring the great Ron Sexsmith."
4,Nordic Mellow Songstress,"Ane has a unique voice, as if Cindy Laupers child, wistful and jazzy and switches it up. Her writing is eloquent and funny and touching, though at times it all sounds a littel repititious."
3,A condensed version of Piper's texts,"I received this little book as one of the ""goodies"" Desiring God Ministry gave away during their national conference in Minneapolis, MN, I attended in September 2004. I found the devotion for each day seems to be a condensed version of John Piper's sermons you can find at their website or books. But I still think it is too long for a devotion and more appropriate for a group Bible Study. If you're looking for a devotional book, I would recommend Spurgeon's instead, short but loaded, to begin and end the day for the entire year. Nevertheless, I still enjoy Piper's God-centered, thought and joy-provoking preachings, particularly in this book, the one about Jonathan Edwards and the pilgrim mindset, taken from Edward's sermon in 1733 ""Christian Pilgrim""."
4,FunJet 1,"FunJet is a great pusher plane for the intermediate pilot who is looking for an rc adrenaline rush. The setup can be kinda tricky but has a great payoff in the end. Learn your basic controls on a simulator and you should be fine. It can cruise at a very slow speed, if about the stall just bump the throttle and you are fine. Always fly in your comfort zone, and watch around you. It will fly better in a large open area and is recommended."
5,Fact or Fishy!!!!!!!,"I am six years old. It's the best DVD game. It's very educational because the Feeding Frenzys (a part of the game) aren't anything about SpongeBob, they are about real live fish. But most of it is about SpongeBob.It's funest to play the whole DVD but I never got that far. Kids will probably never get tired of it unless they play it for 7 hours. Kids can play it on their own if the grown-up puts the DVD in for them. You can play it on your own with out the tokens, just answering the trivia questions."
2,it was alright,"the game was pretty good, but as a kid, the competition was basicly who could read faster. the questions apear on the screen and they don't read it out loud. I played with my friends and I thought I was going to do great because I watch spongebob 24/7 but my friends beat me because they read faster and answered the question first."
1,four feathers DVD,This product is defective and will not play in my DVD player. So my review would be that this was not such a great movie or purchase.
3,movie is not long enough,"First let me say that anyone who thinks the Four Feathers (2002) is too long or too boring should just stick to MTV or Michael Bay films. If anything the film is too short. It doesn't take a genius to see the huge continuity problems in the editing (SEVERAL major plot points are wrapped up in seconds each time, and several others are obviously missing). I've read elsewhere that Kapur was forced to edit the film down from three hours plus. No doubt this was that idiot Harvey Weinstein's doing. I can't understand why he can't see how many films he's ruined by hacking them to bits (including every martial arts import he's ever released). NONETHELESS, I did marginally like the film. Still, I couldn't appreciate it as an epic at this length. This film desparately needs that extra hour of footage restored to it. SOOOO Harvey, when is it gonna happen..........."
2,"Bad, bad Kate","Although this movie felt too long, I enjoyed Heath Ledger and Wes Bentley's performances. Kate Hudson, however, was terrible. Her character was so uninspiring that it was impossible to believe that either of these men would have the strong feelings for her that the story hinged on.Kate Hudson is the next Ashley Judd, and I don't mean that as a compliment."
2,The Four Feather Bore,Sorry but if this movie gets better with time I wouldn't know. I was too impatient and bored to wait. If a movie doesn't capture me in the first 5-10 minutes I'm finished. This could be a five star movie for someone who has some patience and willing to invest the time.
2,A Cinema Insult,"l would give 4 white feathers to the following who were involved with this remake: 1 to the Editor for a lack of coherence and choppy scenes; 1 to the writer for incompetent plotting; 1 to the director for losing control over the basic plot; and the 4th to the studio for releasing this bombastic bomb, an insult to the book and for releasing a movie vastly inferior to the wondrous, compact 1939 version.As usual for movies of this ilk, the production values were superb, but the poor writing and worse editing ruined its viewing.lt virtually became nonsensical at the end."
1,It will not work in Australia made for the USA useless to me,The dvd is not able to be played in Australia i didnt think of that!!!!USA Compatable only Yay+++++ Iv been looking for it for ages in Aus they said try Amazon so i did and i found it lucky me so i need a Dvd in australia.
5,Great Movie,This movie is a great clasic of Heath Ledger's. I had forgotten how good it was and I'm really glad to have found it from amazon.com. I looked at all the regular stores but was unable to find it any where so I decided to give Amazon a look and luckily I was able to find it. I would recommend this movie to anyone who is a Heath Ledger fan. You won't be disappointed.
3,It's not WW 1,"The Four Feathers is based on pre-WWI British imperialist adventures into the Sudan, not during the First World War as some misinformed people have stated. I also believe that the criticism of this movie is mis-stated, I'm not a fan of Heath Ledger, but criticizing this modern Hollywood genre (action-romance date movie) would be like going to see him in A Knight's Tale and expecting to see one of the better versions of Hamlet. Get real. On the whole I enjoyed this movie and I thought the cinematography was exquisite. If you a want a serious well-acted movie, I highly suggest catching the 1939 version on AMC (like I was fortunate enough to do last year). Hopefully the release of this movie will result in the 1939 version coming out on DVD."
5,Inspirational,"Wow, I was very impressed by the sheer emotion of the storyline and the attatchment I felt with the characters. It certainly left me in tears and looking to better my own moral character. I am a big fan of epic pictures that idealize virtues such as honor, integrity and nobility like Gladiator and The Last Samurai. This film is of the same quality as those others, and embodies loyalty as it's crowning virtue. It inspires one to be a better person and is definitely worth putting on your list."
1,Politically Incorrect,"This remake of a classic film is an abomination. Supposedly, thethrust of the changes was to remove ""racist elements."" I have watched the original many times, and I don't see any racist elements, unless you consider the depiction of Africans kicking the ... out of the British Army to be racist. In the remake, a mysterious black bodybuilder guides Harry Faversham step by step through his odyssey. The Ralph Richardson character is reduced to a screaming idiot. Please, watch the original and throw this one in the roundfile."
1,Terrible remake,This is a terrible remake of the two previous movies. I would recommend either one over this waste of film.This movie followed the typical Hollywood formula of romance and violence rather than telling a story. Romance to attract the women and violence & a little sex for the men. The story line was lost in in the emphasis on romance & violence. Characters were not developed. The movie jumped around and left a lot to the watchers imagination.I walked away from the movie with a bad taste in my mouth and wondered why I had wasted my time watching it. Maybe I was hoping it would get better but it didn't!
4,Good as it gets,"This movie was... I can not even explain it. The passion, the excitement, it was unbelievable. The actors weren't that bad either!! Go see this movie!!"
1,DON'T BUY THIS TURKEY,"Technically this is a very good movie, but it lacks any coherent and attractive story telling. If you listen to the audio commentary it's pretty obvious why; the director appears to be preoccupied with bashing the brits. Don't get me wrong. This is not a movie with a political msg. It's a movie with no msg at all."
2,"Great Potential, lousy plot","Wonderful cinematography, costumes, settings and locations but a poor and senseless plot.The battlefield ""tactics"" are absurd, if there was one thing that the British knew how to execute, it was the square. The same tactics had been in use by them for 200+ years.(and used artillery to break up cavalry). Long and boring (interminable ) scenes interspersed. Good talent wasted on an awful plot."
1,A Disservice to the Original,"This is a movie that can not make up it's mind what it wants to be. At times it is an action movie, at other times it is making a statement against imperialism, and at other times a love story. The problem is it does not stay on any one theme long enough to make an impact. It is beautifully shot, but one gets the feeling that a lot of footage and the story wound up on the cutting room floor.It is a shame really, as one keeps getting hints that the cast and the director coul/want to do more in this film, but somewhere along the way the focus got lost"
2,Faithful to its source; just not very entertaining,"Well, at least the movie is faithful to its source in its spirit. Based on a book written on 1902, it's nostalgia of the British empire belongs to that era. The plot deals with a soldier who is expelled from his regiment for refusing to go to fight a colonial war in Sudan because of his impending marriage. Not only his colleagues regard him now as a coward, but also his future wife. He had no choice then but to go to war to prove he is a real man and not a coward. The filmmakers try nothing in terms to bring the material up to date, to our more contemporary (and one hopes, more enlightened) attitudes. There's no post colonial guilt here whatsoever. In some ways, this speaks well of the filmmakers in terms of not trying to tamper with the original material; in another way, it is a bit shocking seeing such jingoism in a contemporary movie. All of this wouldn't matter much if the movie was entertaining; unfortunately, it is only intermittently so."
3,PAINTERLY VISTAS,"The seventh(!) film version of A. E. W. Mason's rousing 1902 novel THE FOUR FEATHERS, is a gorgeous epic. But emotionally remote as the locations.Heath Ledger stars as Harry Feversham, a British soldier who inexplicably resigns from his regiment when they are ordered to the Sudan to fight ""fanatical Mohammedans..."" He gets four feathers, symbolic of cowardice, from his comrades and his fiance, Kate Hudson. Later he hears that his fellows are under siege and makes his way to the Sudan to redeem himself. Wes Bentley is the best friend and Djimon Hounsou is memorable as Ledger's desert guardian.Shekhar Kapur's direction is painterly and the exhilarating middle-eastern themed music by James Horner is layered with floating Arabic motifs and choral laments that sound like the muezzin's call to prayer. Lots of extras and a richly dense commentary."
4,"Superbly acted, will make you think","I never read the novel, nor saw the 1939 old movie version. So I was coming into watching ""FOUR FEATHERS"" fresh. I expected something boring and predictable. That's not what I got. I was enthralled with this film. It is a complicated and humanistic film that will touch you and make you think in unexpected directions.Very well-acted. Nice ending, not too sweet, not too sour. Really enjoyable movie. Highly recommended as an epic historical action film."
3,Left on the Cutting Room Floor,"I had the priviledge of viewing the inital cut of this film in February or March of 2001 at a length of just over 3 hours. Kapur captured the quality of Mason's text and delivered a period piece that would have been favorably compared to Elizabeth. By the time this version of Feathers was cut down to the edition released to the public, it had lost all of the artistry and substance that it contained. Miramax has effectively taken a film that I counted as one of my all-time favorites and reduced it to one that I will not even rent. If a Director's Cut version of this film was released that included the first cut, I would buy it in an instant, but in it's current incarnation it just a mediocre movie."
4,great action! great epic!,"This is a great movie filled with lots of action. It's got a good story. I really liked how they did this movie, And it has become a favorite of mine. Anyone who loves a great epic must see this movie!!"
4,A very underrated film,The Four Feathers is a very underated film in that it shows the Victorian era of the British empire something that isn't protrayed often by hollywood. The acting is so-so which all the other reviewers will agree with but the story is first rate. Maybe if more established actors had taken up this project or a different director the outcome would have been better. The story is solid and some of the scene's are sort of uplifting in the sense of the courage that is protrayed. I enjoyed the film for the same reasons i enjoyed braveheart or black hawk down for the courage that was protrayed. A film that anyone who enjoyed them must consider viewing.
4,"Good, but a little different from the 1977 Version","Entertaining to watch, but a little disappointed in the character development. I enjoyed the 1977 version, for whats its worth, but this version is good, and well worth buying!"
2,Faversham as Wimp,"Nice costumes, pretty scenery and a brief, although well choreographed, desert battle scene are inadequate compensation for poor acting, silly dialogue and a painfully slow start that plague an interminable film with a conspicuously thin plot.Purists will also object to the fact that this current effort obscures the important reason, made plain in the Mason novel and the wonderful 1939 Korda version, for Faversham's apparent act of cowardice. It is not fear, itself, which motivates him to resign his commission but rather the fear of being afraid, of being unable to meet the lofty expectations of a family with strong military traditions.Heath Ledgers' snivelling portrayal, silly hair and floundering accent contribute to the comic aspects of this profoundly unsatisfying work."
1,Slower than a Paralyzed Mollusc,An astonishing mix of great and terrible photography. Painfully slow moving. It starts off OK and then doesn't seem to know when it should have ended.
1,Politically correct garbage.,"This film is another Hollywood attempt at historical revisionism (this time to a fictional work). I walked out 2/3 the way through the film. The only people it will appeal to are the [crusaders] marching in the streets in protest of the war on terrorism. Just be thankful that Martin Sheen or Susan Sarandon were not in the picture.A far superior version of the Four Feathers, though made on a much smaller budget, was the TV version starring Jane Seymour and Beau Bridges.Anyone who wants to see a quality ""historical war film"" ahould purchase Zulu,Gettysburg, or, better yet, wait for the DVD version of ""Gods and Generals""."
4,great! U have to c it,i went and saw it right away! mostly because Heath Ledger was in it but also because it looked good. it would of been good even if he wasn't in it but i encourage all Heath fans to c it right away!*****
2,Poor imitation of the original circa 1939,"The reason that the hero - Harry Faversom- did not go with his regiment and friends to the Sudan was changed from the original. It was ""too preachy"" about the faults of ""the white man's burden"" and the British empire. If they wished to get into this subject, they should have given some backround of why the British were in the Sudan. The movie was very diconnected as far as how the individuals got from one point to the other. The service dress of the troops in the desert was tan not the red red dress parade.IF YOU WISH TO SEE THE MOVIE, RENT THE ORIGINAL!!!"
2,THE FOURFEATHERS--VERY DISAPPOINTED,"This version is the weakest of the threeI have seen. I own the 1939 and 1978 versions. The acting is good, but the screenplay is a bust--too superficial in dealing with the basic theme of cowardice and redemption. Also,having HeathLedger walk among the rebel Sudanese poorly disguised detracts from his effectiveness.The best of the three versions is still the 1939(a great year for great movies!). The plot/screenplay are more true to the arrogant/colonial mood of the day and the acting by Sir Ralph Richardson, John Clements, and C. Aubrey Smith are as yet unmatched. Clements' disguise is more credible, and the battle scenes more realistic. The 1939 version has it hands down, and the directing/screenwriting of the 2002 version are misguided. This could have been a great remake, but is tepid, shallow and falls far short of the mark."
5,Wonderful!,"This movie was, quite possibly, one of the most poignant movies I've seen in a long time. I'll spare you the plot details- you'll find those in other reviews or the summary- but ""The Four Feathers"" is, essentially, about trust, bravery, cowardice, love, and above all: friendship. It made me laugh, smile, and sob when the situation called for it. Lovely, and definitely worth watching!"
5,One of my Favorite movies,"This is a awesome movie about loyalty,friendship,courage and love. It also has great battle seens a must see for anyone."
5,The Four Feathers,This Rendition offers an exceptional interpretation which clearly surpasses all previous movies of the same title and we found it to be a most absorbing and moving story. This is due to the extraordinary talent of Heath Ledger.
3,Uptempo live concert,This is a 2CD live concert. Of course it is in French. Just about all of the songs are uptempo dance tracks.
5,Makes life much easier...,"I've had my Visor Deluxe for over 2 months now and it is hands down one of the best investments I have made. I use it for everything going on in my life: appointments, writing down quick notes, contacts, play games, etc. If you're still wondering if you should get the 2MB or 8MB version, defintely go with the 8MB. The contacts and appoinments don't take up too much space but once you see what applications are out there, you're going to wish you had spent the money for 6 extra MB. I've got AvantGo and Liberty (I know the Visor wasn't meant to play Gameboy games, but it sure is a great time killer) in mine and still have enough memory to add much more (currently have 89% of the memory free). I also expected the batteries to drain quickly but using it for the past 2 months a few times a day has only wasted about a quarter of the battery life. It's just great having all this info in one place and being able to carry it where ever you go."
1,User in New England,"Defective out of the box. Put the batteries in, bulls-eye came on to calibrate pad with stylus, and the bulls-eye jumped all over screen before I touched it. Eventually, it locked up completely. As I tilted the Visor, I heard it beep and discovered that it was responding to movement - like it had a short in it. I took it back the same day."
2,get a palm handheld!,"I ordered my Visor in May-- they have replaced it twice (ie, I am now on the third unit) and at least it appears to be functioning well. (Knock on wood!) I am, however, afraid to add any programs to it, since they made such a point of the fact that ""third party applications"" may cause it to crash and lose everything. It's possible that the latest ""fix"" actually does, but if I had it to do over again, I'd buy a Palm."
2,Not without its problems...,"I bough a Visor and within a few months, it crashed. After reviving it, it crashed again. At the behest of Handspring customer service, I updated the OS which fixed the problem of crashes.Then I was unable to get my Visor to hotsync with my PC and turns out that Handspring was going to send me a replacement. Well! the replacement did not come the next dat as ordered but took almost a week because there was some system disconnect between the people who told me that they would send me a new Visor and the people who had to ship out the Visor. Because I complained Handsping did send me a case for the Visor ""for my troubles"" -- maybe the growing pains of a new company.They could have done better both in regard to the product and their customer service."
5,I LOVE my Visor,"i abslutely love my Visor. i've been able to everything i could have everwanted to do with it. i am so much more organized now wiht it. i had been missing appointments and pices of information when i was away from my desk but now i have it all in one place just the way i like it. i can combine work and personal so well, i ma very pleased all around. very well worth the $."
5,good product,This is a great device to help you get organized. I bought a refurbished one...It works well with Outlook.I never use the grafitti; instead I use the onscreen keyboard. Although I might consider buying the targus portable keyboard which would make this a lightweight fully functional laptop.This device has helped me get organized and I am glad I purchased it.
4,"Meets -- No, Exceeds My Needs...","Definitely worth it!!! Has more mb than many of my co-workers Palm Pilot's (not sure which ones they have, nor how old they are). Definitely has more options, with the expansion compartment that is on the back of it, allowing to have more mb, become an mp3 player, a digital camera, and Lord knows whatelse I'm leaving out...nice toy!!! 4 stars because it came late..."
3,Should've bought a Palm,"I liked my Visor for the first 9 days, then it had a fatal memory error and I lost important info I had gathered while on a business trip and hadn't had time to HotSync with my PC. Now, after less than a few days of use, my replacement unit is having a problem with the display. I'm going to return it and get a PalmIIIC, instead. Sometimes you DO get what you pay for."
4,Best priced 8mb,"Easy to install and synch with PC.I keep loading and loading programs, memory seems never ending.so far so good"
5,Can't imagine life without it....,"My new ""external memory"" has already saved me in the few days I've owned it. No more losing slips of paper with phone numbers and todo lists and reminders. I love the ability to add memo/notes to appointments and to do items - let's you keep the follow-up information with the original trigger.Husband is already making noises about getting him an orange one...and he scoffed at me for wanting one to begin with!"
4,"Fantastic, for the price","This is the second one I owned (first was dropped and screen cracked). Without repeating everone else's reviews, this does what it says it will, is very economical, and is easy to use. BTW customer service is very helpful if you do have problems."
5,Best Gadget EVER!!!,"This is the absolute best gadget you will ever buy! It does everything from organizing your life, to downloading web pages, to replacing your TV / VCR remote.This is a definate must for the gadget enthusiast! I am VERY happy with this PDA; an excellant value that is both economical and fits in your pocket!"
1,Pocket PC is the Way to Go,"I have a Visor and now regret having purchased it. It's great for what it does, but I found the Compaq Aero 1550. For a comparable price you get vastly more functionality including a voice recorder, audio jack, Pocket MS Office software, and a compact flash port, which is similar and more common than Handspring's springboard port."
1,Latch is too sensitive,The bag constantly opens up when the latch comes in contact with almost anything. It's very annoying to realize that the bag is wide open and you have to go thru it to make sure you didn't lose anything. It opened up about two dozen times in my 6-day trip. I had to use a strip of velcro to secure my camcorder inside the bag. I agree with other reviews here that the case is robust and does protect your investment ***if it can stay closed**** otherwise even 1 star is too high for this product.
5,Roomy and sturdy,This bag has enough room to accomodate a compact camcoder and a digital camera and the related accessories. This is very sturdy too. Good buy for money.
5,Like a play,"Intriguing play like dvd of this famous story. Usual BBC adaptation that is well done. Good acting, interesting story from Wilkie Collins' mystery stories.."
2,What happened?,"I'll give this two stars because I thought it was well filmed and enjoyed the actors...but you still need a decent story.This story is a novel adaptation and, as expected, there a a bunch of changes and for some things to be left out - but even if you don't read the book, you feel like things are left out.As a viewer, here's some things that make little sense:Why does the FBI send 50 people to arrest this one guy?What's the point of the polygraph. One scene they are saying it is inadmissible and the next scene he's taking it.Someone (the lawyer) threatens a high ranking officer so he gets the case thrown out...that was an abrupt ending that leaves me wondering why I bothered watching the movie.And for the things that make sense...far too predictable."
5,Great crime movie,"This was a great movie. A woman defends her husband who basically leads two lives. He is accused of murder and she has to defend him with the help of an old time lawyer. Long story short, he beats the charges. But there is something ""fishy"" about this man. Watch it to find out."
3,Predictability Is The High Crime,"That's exactly the problem with this movie.It's way to predictable! This must have looked much better on paper, and I know that they must have thought that they had a huge twist ending, one that could challenge the ending of The Sixth Sense. They were dead wrong. I had the ending guessed within ten minutes of the movie being on, and that's not right!Morgan Freeman is in this only to give it a professional feel and fool people into thinking that this movie is better than it really is. The story is interesting enough, but it's to simple, no creativity involved in the writing whatsoever.The only positive thing about this movie is the acting thaat comes from relatively unknown, Amanda Peet, who, judged by her performance, and beauty, should definantly be in more big hollywood productions. But for the most part, High Crimes doesn't even rank as a misdemeanor."
2,Two and one half stars,"It has its moments but it is only a sometimes exciting thriller that has an obvious ending. In addition, it is too long. Judd offers a decent performance but the film just suffers from poor editing and a screenplay that is just silly at times."
5,Makes it real,"This movie is one of the best out in todays world of movie. It holds your interest and give you good entertainment for your money. Its to bad Hollywood can't make more like this. I can't wait to get it on DVD. If you don'r see this, you will have miss a great movie."
3,Predictable,"I am a big fan of both Morgan Freeman and Ashley Judd and appreciated their fine acting. However, the plot was not very imaginative and the ending entirely predictable. I now own a DVD that I will probably never look at again. But those are the chances one takes when buying a DVD that I had never seen on screen or even on TV before. Sorry, I had hoped it would have been a better ""who done it"""
4,Better than I expected,"At first I wasn't even going to rent this movie from Blockbuster - same old, same old - Morgan Freeman, Ashley Judd, detective, rookie, etc..... glad I went outside the box and rented this DVD - it was entertaining, somewhat unpredictable and had some very good acting and was not a detective/murder mystery type of movie.Ashley Judd plays an attorney who is defending her former marine husband against war crimes. She staunchly believes in his innocence and will do almost anything to win the case. She hires another attorney (Morgan Freeman) who has experience in dealing with military trials to help her. Morgan Freeman is excellent as the recovering alcoholic attorney.The plot is not predictable and just when you think you've got it all figured out, another wrench is thrown into the story.Great way to spend a few hours on a rainy Sunday."
3,"Did He Do It, Or Didn't He?","This was an involving story of a military man accused of murdering civilians 15 years earlier and then going A.W.O.L. The whole story revolves around one question: did he do it or is he innocent?That question keeps the viewer guessing for much of the film and provides some very good suspense. It's another film, however, in which there is a strong anti-U.S. military flavor, so typical in films since the 1960s.Also, once you know the ending, I doubt if this would be a movie you would watch more than once. However, it's definitely worth a look and will entertain you for about two hours. Ashley Judd, Jim Caviezel and Morgan Freeman are three attractive lead actors, all interesting to watch, as usual."
3,A script with holes but watchable!,"Who really believes a lawyer may defend to her husband? Weird jury. Don&acute;t you?But if you let that point outside , you will watch an interesting film with a bit of film noir . Freeman plays an alcoholic lawyer who suddenly must accepth a defiant case .Ashley Judd plays a convincing role ; she &acute;s one of the most beautiful actress in the world and many times the camera reminds us. However the script is surrounded of smart crossroads.Watch James Caviezel as Ron Chapman . Carl Franklin is a consistent film maker."
4,good film,"This was a good, solid suspensful movie. you can always count on Morgan Freeman to turn out a solid performance in a good plot. Ashley Judd was wonderful as well."
2,"Welcome portrayal of military as lying scumbags, but......",".....this movie was so ineptly and poorly done it was almost pathetic. Cliche-ridden script, wooden and unimaginative directing, and laughably contrived plot twists make this one a real zero. It's a real shame, too, because we don't nearly hear about this side of the military enough.A capable cast does what it can with truly wretched material."
2,another one of them Ashley Judd thrillers,"Ashley Judd's (Normal Life, The Locusts) husband, played by Jim Caviezel (The Passion Of The Christ, Frequency) gets arrested and put on the guilty bench for a slaughter in El Salvador a bunch of years ago. So, Judd hires the always superb Morgan Freeman (Unleashed, Million Dollar Baby) to help her out on the case and to find out the truth while she tries to get her husband out of imprisonment. Judd then has threats on her life after. The opening sequence pulls you in, the thrills are a mixed bag (car crash scene for example was good) and the outcome, well, I really saw coming anyway. Ashley Judd's thrid thriller but its her second one with a murderous manipulative husband(Double Jeopardy). Twisted and Kiss The Girls had a killer running after her or playing games with her noggin. Also starring Bruce Davison (X-Men, Dahmer), Amanda Peet (The Whole Nine Yards, The Whole Ten Yards) and Tom Bower (Die Hard 2)"
1,not better than channel surfing,"Other reviews rant about Ms. Judd; frankly, after Double Jeopardy and High Crimes, I'm not seeing the superb actress, but that's aside the point. This movie has one point that can be summed up in this review so you can spend your time better on something else-- Search for truth, not innocence. Especially if you are an attorney."
3,Loved the casting and a couple of lines,"This was just movie candy. I wouldn't watch it again. Military cover ups are a favorite topic of mine, but this was formula scripting. Loved Ashley Judd, Morgan Freeman and (new to me) Amanda Peete. So, if there is nothing great to rent, try it. But it isn't a classic. :)"
5,"Highly, highly recommended","This movie took me by surprise. I was expecting a standard Hollywood crap-a-thon, but instead, I got a brilliantly acted, sharply directed and tightly written bullet of a thriller. By far the most exciting movie so far this year ... The DVD has the director's commentary -- should be interesting. Definitely a buy."
4,Love Ashley? Love Morgan?,"If you are a fan of either Ashley Judd or Morgan Freeman, you should like this movie. I am a fan of both of them so I loved this movie. Sure there are holes in the plot. Yeah, you can see the twist at the emd coming. So what? Ashley is terrific and Morgan is lovable. They have fantastic on screen chemistry. Add to that another of my favorite actors, Jim Caviezel and for some of us 'High Crimes' becomes a can't miss flick. I gave it 4 stars for the plot holes. Could have been 5 stars easily."
5,Morgan has shined again,"From point a to point b the greatness of Morgan Freeganhas shined through.Ashley Judd does a great job in mybook.But the greatness of Morgan Freeman overshadowsAshleys work.Ashley is a remarkable actress and shouldnever have cast in the movie.Morgan Freeman willalways take the spotlight on any film.This movie isno exception.Bigger and better than his last film.Itshows it in this film.It has every element to makethis movie into a class A film.Morgan gives everythinghe has in this film.Ashley,take nothing away from her.Her acting was good.Everything was done to make thismovie a good movie to watch.I WONT GIVE OUT ASPOILER TO THE MOVIE.Ps: If you liked this movie.Rent: Kiss the Girls.A Long Came a Spider.Driving Miss Daisy"
3,suspenseful drama.....,"Morgan Freeman and Ashley Judd work well together in High Crimes as they did in Kiss the Girls. Even though this movie is a bit drawn out during some scenes, it is thrilling for the first-time viewer. I am not a huge fan of murder mysteries or courtroom dramas for that matter, but High Crimes is worth a look for anyone to see whether you really enjoy murder mysteries or not."
2,Plot Holes Big Enough to Drive a Truck Through,"Fine acting, especially by Morgan Freeman. Unfortunately the drunk but brilliant lawyer is a bit of a cinematic cliche.Then we have to deal with the conspiracy by the military and the husband being the fall guy. (Don't read any further if you want to watch this movie) So we go through this whole conspiracy investigation, the General is sufficiently blackmailed to have the charges dropped, then the guy ends up as having done it after all. So then the conspiracy was really a bogus plot device to mislead the audience. The phone taps,Ashley Judd being followed, getting beaten up, etc, etc, etc, all misdirection by the writers and director. but the cast and acting were all good."
3,"Wow, what an incredibly average movie!","So-so plot, so-so directing, so-so acting.... Well, actually, I think the acting was better than so-so, especially given the so-so script, but only marginally so. I can't think of anything about the movie that was especially bad, and likewise, I can't think of anything that was especially good. Well, I did like Morgan Freeman's ""relapse"" scene; that actually made me wonder, ""ooh, I wanna see what happens next."" Rest of the movie was just the usual, predictable stuff. ""*Yawn* I bet that's gonna be a false alarm. Hmm, see?""I'm giving this one 3 out of 5 stars for being such a middle-of-the-pack, average movie."
2,Mediocre and luke warm.,"Like all of this particular author's books, this movie turned out to be the same, mediocre and luke warm like a glass of tap water, hurt your throat but not enough to choke you. I might not want to write a high school like book report to detail what happened in this movie, but I have to admit that not one minute I was committed to this movie during watching. Judd after a long period of diet with vegetables only as her daily food, with two long lines down beside her nose, look dry, drawn, tired and almost no facial flesh to be appreciated as a pretty actress, with Freeman is aging with overweight, this slow motioned movie has turned me off pretty soon."
3,Our family was disappointed,"Even though the movie was well paced, it was so very fictional as it had such an awful message against the armed services. Everybody in the Marine was depicted as being a bad person or a moron. We were hoping at least the main character stayed a good person to offset all the other bad ones, but it didn't happen that way, either.We were all disappointed at the twisted plot at the end. We felt that all the twist did was to surprise the viewers, that was all. It rendered everything else in the movie senseless, failing to explain any of the mysteries throughout the film.The main actors did a good job acting, though. What a waste of a solid cast."
3,no talking from the book,"well got the book, it was supposed to be in working condition...but it wasn't. the book doesn't talk, and well you lose the essence of the book when its supposed to talk to you and it doesn't. meh."
2,assembly nightmare,"company seems very helpful, but the parts do not assemble easily, it's still sitting in our garage after 2 months with my husband trying to figure out a solution (in his free time) that he really doesn't have. Can't rate how fun it is to use"
4,It has that fire!!!,"""Good Girls Pole Riders Club"" by Kimona Jaye was a very intersting tale of friends trying to find themselves. They are trying to find love, where they fit in and discover who they really are.It showed how one little incedent can snowball into some major things. Or rather bring some things to the light that had been hiding or sitting doormat for time. To me, it really touched me because she demostrated the importance of friendship. Real and true friends are hard to come by. When you find that type of friendship, it's what gets you through those hard and rough times."
1,NOPE!!!!! DID NOT MAKE MY BEST LIST!!!,THIS BOOK'S COVER & THE DESCRIPTIONS WILL MAKE YOU THINK THAT YOU HAVE FOUND A GOLDMINE OF A BOOK TO START YOUR YEAR OFF WITH READING BUT FROM THE 1ST PAGE IT WAS A WASTE AND I WAS SOOOO DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS ONE. I FELT THT IT WAS HARD AND CONFUSING TO FOLLOW THE STORY. WHOEVER HEARD OF A PREACHER'S WIFE DRINKING A SLIDING ON A POLE!!!!!
3,Thought it was gonna be good but.......,"This book started off good and it drew me in but somewhere in the middle it slowed down then it didn't really make sense to me.Brenda,Shay and Shaundra had the most problems but in my opinion their problems weren't really solved.I'll give Brenda credit because everything with her was predictable and she steps out of that comfort zone into the unknown but something happens with her at the end and it's not really solved because the book ends.Shay is bored with her marriage.But spends alot of time thinking about someone else.Then the book says its about Shaundra,Karina,Brenda and Shay but Karina is one of those characters that just pops up when they have a get together.So we don't know nothing about Karina except she's weight watcher's number 1 client.It doesn't go into detail on this character.It had potential but it didn't quite do it for me.If this is a series,I'm not sure I want to continue."
2,Disappointing,"I was very much looking forward to playing this CD; it's currently (May 27 1999) the top-selling environmental recording at Amazon.com, and it has garnered some enthusiastic reviews from previous buyers. When my package arrived from Amazon.com I disappeared upstairs to my bedroom and prepared to be spirited away to some deserted stretch of wild ocean. Yet it would take a mind with a much greater imagination than mine to believe even for a moment that the sounds on this CD bear any relation to anything found in nature. The sounds of surf are synthetic and artificial, an undifferentiated hiss and roar, comparable to someone blowing on a microphone. I couldn't recommend this to anyone, and doubt if I'll be buying any more of the 'Sounds of Nature' series anytime soon. Darn."
3,Clears one's mind of office sales calls,"With headphones, this CD does a marvelous job of knocking the surrounding cube noise down--pretty much wipes out sales teams' voices with ocean static. The sporadic seagull calls first cackled out like contrived screeches on metal but after a few spins I stopped harboring that notion. The volume level is decidedly consistent. I'm left wanting something different from a white noise CD because although the waves silence distractions, I can't say that they actually put me into a productive frame of mind. If you need a CD to wipe your mind's slate clean in a distracting environment for five or ten minutes, this is it. If you need a CD that does that plus adds to your creative levels, this isn't a good pick."
3,"good activities, but too much video!","My 8 year old daughter likes the activities/games a lot. But neither of us like the extensive video sequences. She finds them incredibly annoying!I have to imagine that this game is great for any kid who would otherwise be playing video games, but not so great for a kid who has never played them.I am really disappointed. Spent much more than I usually would to get this and the math version of Mia. My daughter much prefers the ""standard"" math games on the old cd we picked up at a yard sale!! The graphics are not as fancy, but it is much more fun (and better for fun learning, too)"
1,Are you kidding me?,"I was very excited to get this software for my grand-daughter. All seemed to go well until I went to start the game. I got the spider guy and then after I clicked ""Start"" I got a picture of a house and then nothing else, my brand new computer totally locked up. I have loaded many other programs onto this computer in the last few days (and yes I have plenty of memory left). Funny thing is that I contacted the company for assistance and was told to check the permissions on the PC..........that maybe I didn't have permission to load the software........seriously? too bad I can't return it because I opened the package"
5,Crack for Kids!,"And I mean that in a good way! My 16-month-old son has been watching Braincandy for a long time (on Comcast On Demand), so glad to see they finally have DVDs out! The problem with the On Demand versions are that they are only 6-10 minutes long each- so I am also thrilled to see the DVDs are much longer. My son LOVES this series, and it is not creepy at all (as someone else on here has mentioned). Yes, the special effects are not stellar, but very young children are not going to notice or care about that. We also tried Baby Einstein and my son was not interested at all. I think this is a FABULOUS series for toddlers!!!!!"
1,Creepy and cheap!,This entire line of video are awful. They are so poorly made and produced and the 'storyline' is so random and hard to follow. Our daughter wsa bored with it after just a few minutes. They movie itself is creepy too - doesn't seem appropriate for kids at all.
3,Laura Fygi at North Sea Jazz,"I was a little disappointed. She is a wonderful singer, her quintet was very smooth, and the song selection was pleasing. But she is too aware of the camera on her. Exaggerated and unnecessary gestures and facial expressions detracted from her performance. I sensed the audience felt the same way. Let the music do all the entertaining Laura. Good, but not great."
3,A good listen,"Laura Fygi is a very entertaining lady. However, I prefer to just listen, not watch. I thought that I was purchaseing a music CD. I should have paid more attention."
2,poor transfer!,"this dvd looks like a bad copy from an old vhs tape.i remember seeing this movie years ago being amazed by itsspectacular images. this dvd print is loaded withfaded and dusty pictures, accompanied by muddy audio tracks.it is disappointing."
1,Empty like the Northwest China Setting,"I have watched many Asian movies the past 4 years. Some such as ""To Live,"" ""King of Masks,"" ""Eat, Drink, Man, Woman,"" I have watched many times because of the high quality of screenplay and acting. On the other hand, other than views of awesome expanses of northwest China that appear from time to time, there is nothing to hold the attention in this movie. The dialogue is sporadic and is coupled with long periods of silence where next to nothing of interest is going on. There is some attempt at being mystical in this movie that just ends up being dull. I would give this the lowest rating of any Asian film I have seen."
5,Jane Austen's Sailor Brothers,A brilliant and informative book written by my great-great grandfather and great-grandmother - buy it!
2,Disappointed,"If this DVD offered continuing education credits or supplemented any equine massage therapy certification program, I would say ""buy it"" if you're a student. However, if you're only after learning alittle more advanced techniques to use on your own horse, I would recommend Masterson's DVD first. I kept waiting to see some relaxation reactions from the horse Mr. Scott is massaging and saw very little at all. Joy, who assists him in this DVD, is more interesting and knowledgeable than Mr. Scott seems to be. I would like to see her version of this type of DVD! Also, there's too much babble regarding muscle and attachment names. After awhile, it puts you to sleep and makes the whole concept attempting to be conveyed very tedious and mind-numbing. Unfortunately, I became less interested in equine massage as the DVD worn on. Wish I felt differently."
4,Amazing,This book is very hard to get through and understand. It isn't until you read it for the second time that it all comes together. Als talks about the women he's known and himself and ties all the lives and minds together.
2,"Pretty showerhead, but low pressure","It looks nice, but doesn't deliver good water pressure. Try another shower-head if you want a high-pressure one. It may take time to locate one."
1,poor quality...great seller,product was not good...completely broken apart and was disfunctional. Not made of granite. Seller was terrific and refunded my money...no questions asked.
4,high speed action/ high caliber adventure.,"While certain bits are far fetched to say the least, this can be overlooked with an animated feature of this caliber. The main character ""Bean Bandit"" aka ""Road-buster"", is a loveable scoundrel in the tradition of Han Solo and other mercenaries with a soft spot for the underdog. Although an 80's anime, the drawing is pretty smooth, and seems to hold up well against more contemporary animated features. As far as the action, one is reminded of films like Mad Max with some of the incredible driving, not to mention the gun-play, which often occurs during the car chases. Finally, there are several rather serious themes touched on in the storyline, kidnapping and child abuse to name two, which makes the film work on a dramatic level as well. In short, this would probably be entertaining even for non anime fans, although probably not suitable for young children due to certain images and themes present therein."
2,Pure Hokum,"This is not a good book. The author is said to be popular in Germany, but, then again, so is David Haselhoff. The book is slight. Indeed, the title and epigraphs bear little or no relation to the book's content. Except for Lila, the characters are like the cardboard cut-outs in the Steve Martin movie The Lonely Guy, to which the book bears some resemblance. The writing is breezy and unpretentious, but there are many bad metaphors and random acts of introspection reminiscent of the Barbara Streisand movie The Mirror Has Two Faces, to which the book bears some resemblance (notably the poetry reading at the end). Some good things about the book: Its length and the brevity of the chapters. The end of the book is pure hokum and utterly predictable."
2,Very disappointing,"Having enjoyed some of the author's previous novels, I found Pure Poetry to be very disappointing. The story centers around the main character who is incredibly annoying and doesn't seem to ever get it. She is not likable, nor is she even interesting. When the reader does not care one whit about what happens to the main character in a character-driven novel lacking any cohesive plot, the result is a mess.I recommend A Disturbance in One Place instead; that is a much more enjoyable read."
5,A must read,"I think this novel is brilliant, daring, funny, and sad. This writer has a way of making you laugh until, all of a sudden, you realize the pain, much the way a young Philip Roth did. Pure Poetry is a multi-layered book. It risks much and acheives much. A must read."
1,Disappointed,"What a disappointment, while there is faint whale song in the background mostly what you hear is water. Water splashing, water raining, waves, etc. I wanted whale song. If you are too, then this isn't the CD for you"
3,perfect music for the dude,i love getting baked like a potato and chillin' to the soothing sounds of nature and whales...and whales.
1,Cassette Was In Horrible Shape,"I received this cassette within a few days of ordering it. When it arrived the cassette was in the middle (not rewound). When i did rewind it it had a very loud screetch because it had demagnitized over the years apparently. I have worked with cassettes and other forms of recording materials for years and i know a cassette when it has demagnitized so it was completely inaudible. I realize the cassette is from 1982, but i found another one that was in perfect shape. All i can say is that maybe you should take the time to actually check each cassette or cd or whatever and not rush deliver it before you do."
4,Great Video,"This video is action packed and very entertaining, shows great fishing sites around the US but specially in Florida. However I give it a four star rating cuz I think it lacks information to the viewer about freediving and spearfishing itself. By the way it is a bit costly online compare to local stores such as Divers Direct, I wound also recommend getting the DVD The Art Of Spearfshing, Good Luck and enjoy!"
5,Great Movie!,"This movie was wonderful, romantic, and moving. I loved the story of the two poets and how they also had a modern day aspect to it, and I loved how the stories matched up. This movie is a combination of history, mystery and the modern era. The acting was great and its so beautifully written. Jennifer Ehle is one of my favorite actresses. If you are into period dramas then I recommend this movie!"
4,"Modest, Quiet, Pleasurable Love Story","Two literary scholars seek out the unknown details of the romance of two 19th Century English Poets. In the process of exploration, they are led to explore the nascent relationship between themselves. No rockets, comedy or torment in this one, at least, for the contemporary couple. No suspense for the reader, either. Yet, watching a quartet of expert players handle love without marriage, is a rewarding experience. There is a certain melancholy in the anticipation of the past and future, but a decently humane one. If you are in no need of fireworks, sturm und drang, in passionate scenes, you may well enjoy this one."
3,Chick flick,"I love Jennifer Ehle. That is the only reason I bought this movie. Its pretty good. I think they could have cut out everything with Gwyneth in it and I would have been just as happy. Its a chick flick, its ok. Jennifer and Jeremy did a great job, the other people, meh, not so much. You can stream this online on the big company that shall not be named that starts with a N. I wouldnt buy this again."
2,Brilliant book dumbed down for film,"The book, Possession by A.S. Byatt, was one of the best novels I have read in years. Unfortunately, all of the themes that make it a wonderful novel - feminism, the expectations of society, British reserve, a woman's struggle between love and work, and much more - do not translate well to a movie, and of course don't appeal at all to the modern American moviegoer. The story lines were ""dumbed down"" to fit the just-under-2-hours pace of a movie, ignoring all of the subtleties that made these characters believable in print.Gwyneth Paltrow and Aaron Eckhart have no chemistry between them, and that only underscored the fact that their ""struggle"" to stay away from each other was poorly written in the film. Jeremy Northam and Jennifer Ehle do sizzle, and made up the only watchable parts of this movie.If you loved the book, keep it in your head and ignore the film version. If you want a light romance, stick with ""Sleepless in seattle"" and the like."
1,sorry i bought this,I bought this based on someone else's review. Wrong! It just proves that one man's treasure is another man's garbage. This was garbage.
5,Captivating movie,I just want to say that I agree with most of the reviewers here that it is a brilliant movie with equally brilliant actors. Captivating from beginning to end. Highly recommended.
3,"The good, the bad and the ugly...","The Good:The 19th century costumes and atmosphere were beautiful.Jeremy Northam and Jennifer Ehle are beautiful to look at. I found their portrayal of the star crossed Victorian lovers to be very well done. What was quoted of the poetry was lovely.The Bad:Looking into the past at the romantic and poetic lovers by the history loving sleuths, Maude and Roland should have made a great story. It fell short. It was dis-jointed and did not flow seamlessly from past to present and vice versa. I would not say this movie was a total loss , I did enjoy it somewhat, hence 3 stars.The Ugly:The portrayal's of the modern day sleuths was abysmal. I've watched both these actors {Paltrow,Eckhart} perform much better in other roles. Neither was a good fit for their roles in this movie. They had no chemisrty at all.On a final note, do the British really look upon their American cousins with such disdain? From watching this movie one would think so."
5,GOOD MIX OF HISTORICAL AND MODERN FICTION,"A. S. Byatt won the Booker Prize for writing this novel. It, and the movie, are hard to characterize. Fiction, yes. Historical? Sort of, if fictional characters of Victorian England count. Beautiful scenes of England. A Yank that is not a total jerk (a novelty in modern British art). Believable acting. A predictable story. Yet, a compelling and very, very enjoyable movie for Anglophiles, romantics, ghost-story buffs, and obsessive movie-goers. I will watch this many times and I am reading Byatt's novel! She is brillant! A great Amazon purchase!"
4,"Lovers, Poets, and Academics","A cute movie, something along the lines of aShakespeare in LovemeetsThe Da Vinci Code. The movie follows two academics as they hunt down tantalizing clues about a 19th century poet's extramarital love affair. While it is clear from the beginning that they the poet did have an affair, the movie throws in a few twists and turns. United in their quest, Aaron Eckhart and Paltrow's characters inevitably fall in love.The movie has a nice rhythm to it. It never really throws up any major surprises, but the storyline is original enough that it remains entertaining. Both Paltrow and Eckhart act pretty well in this film, so it's pretty easy to sympathize them along as they become obsessed with the dead poet's love letters. Overall, a great date film."
3,Jennifer Ehle saves it...,"I love Gwyneth Paltrow, but she was an ice maiden in this role, not portraying the character with any warmth, passion, or conviction. Vacant is the word that comes to mind.Why oh why did the producers/writers have to change Roland into being an American? I'm American, but it totally disrupts the romance between the two leads, and he was not a thief to the extent portrayed in the film. Awful.Jennifer Ehle is magic. She brings as much passion and life to this character as she did to Lizzie in Pride and Prejudice! Only Colin Firth could have improved the sensational love story here between the two poets.The actor who portrayed Randolph Henry Ash was lost in Jennifer Ehle's performance. She so overshadowed him.Lovely movie, but the modern day romance falls flat on its face... much to my disappointment."
4,Great Romance,"The trailers made this movie look like a mediocre love story, but in reality this is a highly involving romance. The two stars fit very well together, and their characters were very interesting. This is one of the best romance movies of the year so far."
3,"Nice movie, but not engaging.","This movie has a lovely plot involving love, intrigue, and passion. However, the two modern day researchers did not have the chemistry they needed to carry a movie. That story line in general, finding a lost letter and teaming up to find more lost literature, was weak. The movie portrayed the search as easy, and not very exciting. I just didn't care if Gywneth Paltrow's character ended up with her beau. However, Jennifer Ehle and Jeremy Northam were superb. Their characters each already loved another, and struggled through their growing attraction to each other via letters. Their final meetings and the resulting life changing subsequences were very well characterized. The whole movie was worth seeing at least once just to see these two go from meeting each other to...well, the end (so as to not give anything away). I ached for them, and wanted them to be happy. This movie was almost great."
2,Read the book instead,"If this movie was ever going to have a chance, it needed to be about 4 or 5 hours long, or never attempted in the first place. Some books adapt well to being edited and condensed as a screenplay - Possession just can't be dealt with that way. What you have as a result is another story entirely. I guess there just wasn't time enough to develop the characters, or even to include half of them. The only character true to the book and left almost intact was Sir George. The rest were stripped of their layers and everything that made them fascinating, and we are left with painful stereotypes and, in the case of Roland Michell, a character who seems to have wandered on to the wrong set during filming. My best advice is that if you've read the book, skip the movie, but if you saw the movie, you should do yourself a favor and get the book."
2,huh?,I give this one 2 stars for the period sequences. I found the actors in these scenes were very good..much better than the scenes starring Ms. Paltrow and her companion. I got bored with this movie very fast. The only thing that kept my attention was the story behind the story. I really wanted to love this movie.
4,"A Film For Those Who Believe In ""The One True Love""","To appreciate this story, you have to believe that two people can meet and quickly fall forever into forbidden love. That is what is at the heart of this film. If you can't accept that premise, the movie simply does not work. And what makes it throb with life for me are the excellent performances of Jeremy Northam and Jennifer Ehle whose mutual passion sweeps us along. Paltrow and Eckhart are a secondary love story here, but you never feel that they really care for one another. Worth your time if you are a romantic. OK, I'm a romantic. Sue me!"
1,Another American hijack,"No! Help! In the book it was all English, I thought it was great. Now the Americans destroy the whole thing by introducing a great galumphing outsider American who misses the whole point but is really BIG ON NUANCES. No! Please! Stop Doing It!"
4,Makes you want to read more poems,I loved the parts of the movie with Jeremy Northam and Jennifer Ehle. The Victorian romance was more interesting than the modern one.I particularly liked knowing more about the romance of Ash and Cristobal than they knew.I rented this film and afterwards bought one for my collection.It is a keeper.
3,Needs a bit more,"An impossible film to translate from an excellent book, but it does give it a good try. Possession is a competent film with good acting and wonderful art direction. Yet at 90 minutes, it simply condenses far too much. Some characters barely appear on the screen.The writers and directors should have given themselves far more room.What can I say? Read the book"
1,Wrong DVD,The DVD that was sent to me was not what I ordered. Possession with Gwyneth Paltrow was what I ordered but did not receive.
2,2/3 of it should be flushed,"I really worked the fast forward button with this one! The contemporary ""love"" story between Paltrow and the poorly cast, ""brush-n-flush"" American actor was the pits. (I guess the director just HAD to work with this guy.) The Ash/LaMotte story is the only part of it worth watching. Too bad there wasn't more of it."
3,Believable But A bit Stiff and Somewhat Boring,"Overall I found the film lacking in dramatic tension. Going back and forth between characters and similar situations is starting to become an overworked cinematic cliche. I was waiting and waiting for the passion... Waiting and waiting for an earth shattering love scene - a scene that would resonate with the lovely words that came and went like a flash in the night. But in the end I yawned and said: Yes, Paltrow is a competent actor and so are they all competent actors. Still, I found myself squirming in my seat and glad that I was in the Twenty First Century because obviously the Victorian era was probably as stuffy as this movie.A lot of smoke here, but no real fire, no real pathos or chemistry between the leads, even the subplot somehow missed its mark.I wish Ms. Paltrow would find a script worthy of her talent. Obviously this wasn't the one. Still, it was better than that silly Hal movie."
2,What was Neil Labute thinking when he made this?,"If you are a fan of Neil Labute, you know that he can be merciless in his views of people and the world But why would he subject himself to a pointless and mind numbing film like this? I barely got though this film with out falling a sleep, and that was an feet all in itself. Aaron Eckhart is better when he is bad, and Gwyneth Paltrow' is fine but look like she would have rather been some where else.Hopefully Labute will stick to what he knows and leave the stiff love stories to lesser directors."
2,Disappointing,"Not nearly as enjoyable as his earlier books. Reads like a rough road. Character relationships seemed very awkward. Pretty good story line, but not fun to read."
2,INTERESTING,"As old books, very few illustrations, alas, all in black & white, and VERY FEW information about jewelry (was my search & interest).But as quite nothing exists talking about tortoiseshell, shells & jet jewelry ...."
3,An interesting Read,"I was lent this book by somebody who wanted me to read a good book and also because, my name is the same as the person who wrote it. While I do agree that it was an interesting read, though, I cannot say I agree with the assesment I was given. I found myself increasingly confused as the plot went on. Everything that happened held my attention, yes, but the book went nowhere. Other than some very well written points of shocking imagery, by the end of my read I retained nothing of what had happened. The middle of the book, especially, though interesting, is very convoluted. In the end, I would call it interesting but unmemorable and I would leave it at that."
4,Coil - Deeper than you,"It's hard to put the Coil experience into words. On the surface, it's just weird music, but underneath it all is deep symbolism, cosmic energy and some truely mind warping tones. John Balance and co. are definitely tuned into something on a much higher plane than the rest of us and MtPitD really illustrates this. One moment, the music is serene, peaceful and very relaxing. The next moment it's all torn away from you and the music takes a dark plunge, full of chaos. The first track, Are You Shivering, is quite chilling (not to make a bad pun), the sound penetrates you and chills the root of your being. Brocoli is another noteworthy track. I can't tell if this is some kind of strange joke. The lyrics don't give you a second to take it seriously. The music is a lot more structured than Coil had produced in the last few years and it's definitely welcome. You can tell a lot went into this recording and listening to it is a very rewarding experience."
5,Lunar Developments,"Unlike other previous Coil recordings this CD was based on Moon structures, instead of Solar which gives it a very different feel. Most people who read this title will feel as if it is going to be a return to the blood chilling sounds that they created before, but it isn't at all. This is total otherworldly music, not in the nature of the sound of Black Light District, but in a more transcendental sort of way. The sounds are very enveloping they are almost intrancing, kind of building on some elements that ""Baby Food"" had. The music is liquid, watery it seems to go right through you. This music is like osmosis, the more you listen the more you take a way from it. The artwork mirror the sound very well. No sharp edges to cut yourself with, but you may find that you have already drowned."
5,coil's umbriferous side,"This is one of the best coil's cd ever. It has the hidden strenght to go straight to your mind. Each time you listen to it your journey goes deeper. 'The dreamer is still asleep' and 'Broccoli' lead you into another dimension of consciousness pulling the strings of your senses. Listen to this music at night, as the title recommends, and you'll never be the same."
3,Riverside Literature Series Weekly Publications,"What a wonderful find;I picked up my 1st copy (Riverside Literature Series #4) JG Whittier, in an antique store and was overwhelmed by the Poet & the Publication."
5,good teaching tool,the book was in good condition and is a good teaching tool for parents who want their kids to learn conservative values.
5,Rabbit Hill,"I bought this book for my grandson's Christmas book because I remembered it very fondly from my own childhood. I decided to reread it before Christmas. The book is a joyful tale of facing change and learning to ""get along."" The animals are drawn with a fine pen that makes them come alive. I am so happy to be passing this classic along to my grandsons."
2,The life story of the animals on Rabbit Hill,I enjoyed this book. I did not fully understand the end where the statue of St. Francis is brought in. But over all I liked the adventure and the homestyle of the animals. Good book for children 9 yrs. old and up.
2,Not my first choice for a book,"I read this book earlier in the year and I got so bored while reading it, I almost didn't finish it. The beginning was so boreing I actually fell asleep reading it! The ending however, wasn't so bad. It was actually quite suspenseful. All in all, I think that younger children would enjoy it more than teens and adults."
2,green hill,"The book was a page-turner I just wanted to turn the page. This book has a lot of excitement. No because I myself did kind of connect to main character he was just so cheerful. I learned that you could make the best of things. The genre is Fiction. The style of writings significant they use words like feminine. There was a good part with George singing a song about the new folks coming. The chapters did not end with cliffhangers. The story gets uninteresting at some parts, like how the animals talk about stuff. The plot was believable; it had a super good plot. I would recommend this book to people who like animals. It is a good funny book."
2,Not that great,"This is one of those books that looks okay but really stinks. It has basically a very small plot and no conflict that isn't resolved before the end of the chapter. It's written like some enviromentalist was trying for a utopia (and this was before the rise of the enviromentalists, too) The only thing that saves it from a one star is that it is very well written. Pity it has such a bad plot, it had the makings to be a great book."
4,"Enjoyable little book, especially for animal lovers.","A charming little story, Rabbit Hill brings the small animal world to life and almost makes one want to plant a garden just for them. The general attitude is one of sharing and looking out for one another, and the book subtly promotes reading as a worthwhile practice. The author's illustrations add to the charm of the book."
5,Humorous Scince Fiction Adventures,"This book contains adventure tales that are a fast read, light yet satirically wild. There are two novels about hapless heros caught in a world with changing time streams out of their control. We follow the heros as they travel through these differrent times and deal with the obstacles they encounter, as they try to get back to where they started from.This collection of Mr. Laumer's works even contains three short stories which are worth reading on their own merit. One has Satan asking a professor to aid him save Hell. Another is a movie production studio using Earth as a set, and they plan to blow the set up at the end of the movie. and the final short story is about a time where you can purchase any body you can afford.If you do not have this book, buy it. If you have it, read it. You will be glad you did."
4,Simply Wonderful,"Wonderful renditions of popular songs done a cappella style by various college singing groups. Some songs are done so well, I almost couldn't believe they there were no instruments supporting the voices. ""Secure Yourself"" is a stunner, and ""No More I Love Yous"" sounds almost identical to the original song. I got this CD after I already bough Best of College A-Cappella 1998 which was even better... thus 4 stars... but definitely a CD you will enjoy."
1,Pocket PC is the Way to Go,"I bought a Visor but now regret it. I've since looked into Pocket PCs and the Compaq Aero 1550 is a comparable size and price with far greater functionality. It has a voice recorder, audio jack, rechargable battery, and a Compact Flash port, which is much better than the Springboard port. It also has versions of MS Office software."
1,Bizarre to say the least...........,"I read the book description.....Unger argues for the extreme skeptical view that, not only can nothing ever be known, but no one can ever have any reason at all for anything.......Why the hell would I ever have any reason to spend my money on this book? S. Guha obviously did and told us the rest of us can't be fair unless we read this book. There are thousands of books to be read. A book with this absurd claim (and how could the author know anything if nothing can be known, and how can S. Guha know anything?) is not worth the expenditure of time or money.Readers who defend this kind of crap .... keep going.There are lots of Kool-Aid drinkers who will believe you.Stephen Struk(my real name)Wyckoff, NJ"
5,Great,I really like this brand. Easy to swallow. Clear caps with white powder inside. Same size as their 500 mg caps.
4,Non-Fiction,"Now here's an example of a more interesting Haigh book, where an actual bit of insight and analysis has to go into production.It takes a look at the split that happened when the top-level professional cricketers decided that they were really getting a raw deal from the various cricket boards, who were getting pretty close to all the money, leaving the players with little to show for their sacrifices.Also the rise and rise of sports media, and improvements in coverage, too.3.5 out of 5"
2,careful!,"First of all,I did not buy this case. But I just bought one for my 5th gen ipod 30gb. The info said it would fit a 30/60 gb ipod. I didn't realize there is a difference in size, so my 30 gb won't stay put in the case. Beware of sizes for different gb."
4,"A great ""sampler"" of Hezzie's early 90's work","If you want a sample of early 90's ""fun"" gospel music and have heard about Hezekiah, look no further.By fun gospel music, I'm referring to music with catchy melodies and repetitive riffs; the kind that's excellent for exercise, highway driving, or just plain ""jammin' in the Lord,"" as the saying goes.No one makes this type of music the way that Hezekiah did, which is why he was and still is so widely imitated. Every single song contained on this CD is a classic and many of them are stll part of his repertoire when he and his choir tour.If you like this album, it's for certain that you'll love everything else that he does as well. It's a great place to start for anyone looking to explore Minister Walker's earlier work."
3,quality comparison,"There appear to be 3 versions of this currently available. I own two of them. Of the two I own, the CHEEZY FLICKS disc is preferred over the TRINITY disc for the following reasons:1) Though image quality of the CHEEZY FLICKS disc is not great, it is clearer than the TRINITY disc.2) The CHEEZY FLICKS disc includes extras (vintage intermission ads and trailers for other movies), while the TRINTIY does not.3) The TRINITY disc cuts-off a tiny bit more of the image on the sides of the frame than the CHEEZY FLICKS disc does.That said, the TRINITY disc does have two things going for it:1) The color on the TRINITY disc is richer on the CHEEZY FLICKS disc.2) The CHEEZY FLICKS disc cuts-off more image on the top and bottom than the TRINITY disc does (and the amount of loss is greater than the amount of side-to-side loss that one gets with the TRINITY disc."
3,A guerilla filmaking time capsule!!!,"Adios Amigo is a funny and whacky film made on a half of a shoestring of a budget. Atleast that is how it appears!!! The production values are strained and the the writing is somewhat flimsy!!! But, if you are a fan of the co-stars, Richard Pryor and Fred Williamson, who gives a damn. These guys are ripe for adventure and at the peak of their powers. Now, in back of the camera, no doubt, the pressures and machinations of Hollywood were poised to crush this effort in the preamble. But, the movie was made anyway, and that is a miracle in itself. Kudos to producer and Co-Star Fred Williamson!!! The mood is decidedly lighthearted!!! if you can get this film, watch it with an appreciation for the effort and the pure courage it took to even mount the production against insurmountable odds. Sillyness not-withstanding,The more times you view it the funnier it gets!!! Go ahead and laugh!!!"
1,Bad Copy,"This movie looked a lot like bootleg. The picture quality is poor, and it is definitely not formatted to fit a TV screen."
1,Garbage,"I tried this subscription and I was completely dissatisfied. It's like a news paper on the inside, EVERYTHING IS BLACK AND WHITE!I ultimately went with both Backyard Flyer and Model Airplane News. They are Awesome magazines that cover every aspect of RC Flying and everyone from newcomers to pros read these magazines."
5,Excellent Fun! Great Read!,"Finally a good look at The Ramones from the inside! Through this oral history Monte Melnick manages to really capture the flavor of the time and give us a glimpse of what it was like to be part of the Ramones machine. He doesn't over glamourize and doesn't shy away from the painful realitites of their lives like Joey's OCD and later cancer, Johnny's often cold, militaristic grasp on the band and Dee Dee's lifetime of drug addiction, bi-sexuality and abusiveness. What does come through is the fun, the love/hate dynamic that existed within the band and a good look at how these guys from Queens managed to revolutionize rock 'n roll. On their terms. It's brilliant."
3,Monte? Oreo?,"I bought this book being a long time Ramones fan!! I read it in around three days. And found some of what is quoted inside to be of wonder. Johnny Ramone is quoted many times. But, So is My all time favorite bass guitarist Dee Dee Ramone. Many details about being on the road with the Ramones, Is revealed!! And this is great!! I do wonder just how much of it was exaggerated!! You know I think high of Monte!! But, Every fisherman has a story!! And with each story, The fish grow bigger!! I was not there though. So all I can do is wonder!! This is a good read!! If Your at all a Ramone fan, Or even a fan of punk...BUY THIS BOOK!!"
5,Yes Melnicks!,"Despite the fact that this book was written as a narrative, much like "" Please Kill Me, "" it was a pleasant and an easy read. This book is a tad more credible than most of the other Ramones books out there since one of its authors was none other than Monte A. Melnick, who not only worked as tour coordinator for The Ramones but who also was a friend and confidante to the band members. While Dee Dee's novels consisted of little more than inane, misspelled ramblings about which drugs he imbibed and how badly he was treated, Mr. Melnick's book is articulate and concise and one can surmise that he spent more time sober and that he had a better grip on reality. The book tells of the time spent on the road ( as the title suggests ), but it also gives a little more personal insight into the lives of the band members through interviews with those closest to them ( not least Mr. Melnick, himself ). This book is a must for any Ramones fan."
2,Not up to standard,"I have been a faithful Mia fan for 5 years and have bought all the other games for my two kids. This game is a big disappointment. The language game is virtually unplayable in French. I am fluent in French and went to a French language university for nine years. I could barely understand what the characters were saying. If this program is intended to teach kids a second language, it would be more likely to turn them off the language instead. This game definitely does not cater to anyone who does not already have an understanding of French."
3,Pretty good product,This product is pretty good. My little boy is 5 and is just really wanting to learn Spanish so I bought this product to help him. The animation is spectacular but he got bored with it very quickly.
1,Not as represented; does not work on Mac,"We have tried installing & using this program on two different Macs, both of which are within the published system requirements. It does not work and we will be pursuing a refund. I wanted a fun and educational program for my kids."
5,great,I had previously bout a long hair sheep skin rug but ended up returning it for this one. I like this shorn one much better- Seems safer for the baby.Great quality!
5,Bowron Sheepskin,"It is as beautiful as pictured, and twice as soft. All my grandchildren (8 right now, with 2 more coming soon) have spent their first year sleeping on one of these lambskins. Some have become their ""comfort"" blankets as they grow older."
4,Just what I expected,We bought this for our newborn to practice tummy time. Also bought it for my new nephew 2 months older than ours. Good reports so far and our newborn seems to like it. Hates tummy time but it has nothing to do with the sheepskin.Remember to frequently shake out/beat the rug to manage the dust and hair that accumulates surprisingly quickly.
5,You need this. Seriously.,"The lambskin is the ultimate multitasker: changing pad, nap mat, playmat, carseat liner, you name it. It is unbelievably cushy without being too bulky, it regulates temperature perfectly, and it's super-easy to spot clean (use a cleaner with lanolin in it). I also love that the skin backing doesn't pick up dirt. My baby has slept on her lamby everywhere, including a concrete parking lot. My 3 year old naps on it every day. Heck, I've even slept on it! You won't regret this purchase. It was the best one I made. My only regret is that I didn't have one when my older daughter was a babe."
2,"Some Good Songs, SOME","Im not gonna lie, there are a couple of good songs. BUT alot of the tracks sound the same and its like he is singing his hooks in a low voice. ""AINT NO CLICK LIKE....."" ""IMMA WARRRIORRRR""DONT GET THIS ALBUM, GET JADAKISS, Lil Wayne's tha Carter"
2,Only for G-Unit 50 Cent fans. [2 and a half stars],"First of all, I don't like 50 cent,I got his get rich album, that album is good [only good] because got some nice beats,and I haven't get G-Unit album, I don't like them actually!But I heard about Lloyd Banks is the best member from G-Unit,Ok, so I give it a try.....the result is, a little bit disappointed,It's just an Eminem/50 Cent sounding cd,nothing new, special, groundbreaking,and I'm sure you are crazy if you're looking for those three elements on THEM!!!Warrior/On Fire/Karma is Great but beside those three songs,all is so-so,and Lloyd Banks and 50 cent voice..... actually sounds quite same,especially chorus, I always think 50 cent sounding.ok, only for 50 cent fans, not for true rap fans!If you wanna get a lately release....GO GET JADAKISS NEW ALBUM INSTEAD!!! KISS IS MAD NICE!!!"
1,This is the kind of crap wrong with hip-hop today.,"Lloyd banks sucks. His wannabe attempt at creating a gangsta sounding album fails miserably. This crap is for teeny bop fags, if i didnt know any better i would say this album is pop-inspired. I hate these fake a** b*tches(namely Gay-Unit)with their big egos thinking they are better than everybody else. This guy has an exrtemely annoying voice and he cant rap, and his lyrics are pure trash so are his beats. Screw gay-unit and everything that has to deal with them."
1,Boring,Lloyd Banks is weak.His Lyrics are so bad and ridiculous.There are almost three good songs.This album is boring
2,Weak,"Man, Compared to 50's album, This was garbage. It was not nearly as good as it could have been. G-Units album was tight, and Obie Trice's was off the hook but loydd Bank's was sub-par at best. The beats on it almost sounded like some studio tracks that were left off the G-Unit album for a good reason. It was only good enough 4 2 stars, which is still better than anything No Limit, and Murda Inc ha released in years."
3,Fire Extinguisher,Lloyd Baks 1st solo project is aight. He got about 6 tight tracks a couple other soso. Had some good help from 50 & 1 of the TIGHTEST of all time EMINEM gotta keep it real. Good buy- good 4 collection never a classic:(But it's some REAL G-Unit flava
1,Weak Sauce,Nearly every track on the album has some r&b singing crap on it. Thats pretty much all i have to say about this album. I gave it one star because its worth one listen.If I wanted to listen to R&B id pick up Joe or R Kellys albums. heh.
4,its a 4 outta 5,this cd is not as good as Get Rich Or Die Tryin or Beg For Mercy but overall its a decent album. The worst song is karma or playboy. my favorite is till the end and warriors part 2. its an 8 outta 10.
3,Good but not up to expectations,"OK i think the album is good but not good enough...I think he needed better beats to compliment his flow..I think that obviously Warrior, and Fire are bangers, but nothing else compares to them, except I personally thought ""WHen the Chips Are Down"" was the best song on the album when i got sick of Warrior and Fire...Banks is alright, but it aint a classic.Banks i still think is better than yayo, and buck...."
4,Almost great album hampered by one lousy track,"This would be a 5 star album except for track 2, ""Playboy"", which while the lyrics are not bad, the beat is awfully annoying and just plain awful to be honest. Other than that, this cd is hard no doubt. The beats are great and Banks has got the delivery to match. Standout tracks include ""I'm So Fly"", ""Work Magic""(especially Buck's verse), ""South Side Story"", and ""Just Another Day""(you gotta love that catchy hook). But like I said all the tracks are tight in one way or another save for track 2. Another track I feel could have been replaced is track 10, ""Karma"". It's not really that bad of a song but it is one clearly put on the album to appeal to the ladies. Replacing it with a track more gangsta would have been on point. Overall great album though and Banks is one to watch for the future, along with the rest of G-Unit."
2,weak debut,"I've been a fan of G-Unit since 50 signed with my boy Eminem, but I'm keeping it real: Lloyd Banks' album is WACK! Banks is a good rapper, but his flow and most of the beats on this album are weak at best. By far, the highlight song is ""Warriors Pt. 2"" featuring Eminem, 50 Cent, and Nate Dogg. The song ""Karma"" is pretty much a weak version of ""Smile"". My advice: Skip this album and pick up Young Buck's ""Straight Outta Ca$hville"" instead."
4,Good but expected more...,"Lyrically, there is no one currently signed to a label better than this man. He uses the most ridiculous metaphors and truly is the best thing about GUNIT. Pay attention to the lyrics in each of these songs, they are insane. Lyrically, he's up there with Biggie, 2PAC, Eminem etc...One thing that kind of sucks about him is he needs someone else to be in a song with him to be good. If he sings all of the verses and the chorus, it sounds very monotone and could come off as dull and trite. And, it annoys me how he kisses 50's ass...50 should kiss his ass...GUNIT is garbage without Banks...the next best is Tony Yayo and he spends more time in jail than the studio...Young Buck has the best flow but the only good thing about him is Monica. 50 thinks way too much about himself and should be embarassed with his performance at SummerJAM"
2,Could've Been Better... Don't you think,"I'm not really hungry for anymore, and yet I'm far from full. This album was definitely not as good as it was hyped to be. If this is the direction hip hop is going to, then we have a big problem. Alternate suggestions: Lil' Wayne, The Carter; Kanye West, College Dropout; Goodie Mob, One Monkey Don't Stop No Show;"
3,"Not Bad, But Nowhere Near ""Get Rich""","I bought Hungry For More during the G-Unit hype and I have to say that this is a good album.The best tracks on the album are both Warriors and a great story in Til The End.The beats are great as we would expect from anything G-Unit. If Lloyd Banks can improve on his next album is could beon par with ""Get Rich.""Lyrics:4/5Banks is the best lyricist of G-Unit(The Current G-Unit excluding The Game).Beats:3/5Sha Money XL is a good producer."
4,WAY BETTER THAN 50's ALBUMS,"Lloyd Banks tells us more about himself in this debut. I like the way he rhymes and his flow is good, too. He is definitely the most lyrical out of the G-Unit crew, and way better than 50.1) Ain't No Click- feat. Tony Yayo (5/5)2) Playboy (4/5)3) Warrior (4/5)4) On Fire- feat. 50 Cent (4/5)5) I Get High- feat. Snoop Dogg & 50 Cent (3/5)6) I'm So Fly (5/5)7) Work Magic- feat. Young Buck (3/5)8) If You So Gangsta (4/5)9) Warrior, Pt. II- feat. Eminem, 50 Cent & Nate Dogg (5/5)10) Karma- feat. Avant (2/5)11) When The Chips Are Down- feat. The Game (3/5)12) Till The End (3/5)13) Die One Day (3/5)14) Southside Story (4/5)"
1,"The Hunger for More, is the Hunger for Less.","This is one of the worst albums of 2004, a poor ridiculous album featuring lloyd banks who looks like method man/fabolous, I'm so fly is one of the stupidiest songs I've seen (although the video was much better), and on fire is an idiotic rip-off of christina aguilera's dirrty and warrior is so awful it makes me sad like sour, this is a preposterous mess that should be even know as good album,The Hunger for More is the hunger for less.No Thanks.One Star."
2,Bank$ debut isnt as strong as I thought it would be....,"Lloyd Bank$ debut Hunger For More is mediocre at best. His first single On Fire was ok. His second single is I'm so fly....this song isnt any different from any other rappers songs right now. We all know he has a little bit of money and a couple cars. Warrior(For Tha Thugs) & Karma(For Tha Ladies) are the best songs on the album. I cant wait for Young Bucks album Straight Outta Cashville because that will be hot. As for this, if you are a true G-Unit fan, you will probably buy it, but as for me, I burned it.....and trust me, I DONT REGRET IT."
1,More crap,"This is nothing but more crap from another g-unit member.why do they even bother?All G-Unit crap sucks.And the fans suck too for being stupid.Everytime I hear their music, I feel my brain cells dying.It's all crap."
5,what do you also need to know,anthony my girl past away here in ogden here dad shot her on the mountain because of a fight with her mom
1,disapointment!,sucks!the production!the lyricsjust the singles.warriorfire&im so flystand outother than thatthis album is bootythe reason why it sells so much cus duke is G-unitthat YOUNG BUCK -WELCOME to CASHVILLE is better! cop that 1 instead of this....
2,trash,"On the g-unit album LLoyd Banks sounded alright, but by himself this guy is nothing but trash. The only reason I even gave it 2 stars was because of the people he had featured on the album. The best song on the cd is even because of him its because of Nate Dogg, 50, and Eminem."
2,nothing stands out,"eh, i don't think this disc was all it was hyped to be. nothing about it stood out. i can't really hear lloyd that well with his mumbling. i think he was hyped to be this great rapper but honestly, i'm listening to nas's stillmatic right now and this cd doesn't even come close. beat for beat, rhyme for rhyme a rapper like nas would destroy everyone in g unit. if you're up for something new, i'd say definitely check out masta killa's or ghostface's new offerings."
1,Quit mumbling and say something,"This G-Unit gahbage makes me ashamed to even be from the East Coast. Banks, The rest of G-Unit, and countless other lolly-pop and psuedo thug persona groups are living proof that hip hop is in serious jeapordy. Why would you buy this garbage, what are you getting out of it??? Call me a hater if you want and disagree with my opinion, I could care less. My only advice to most of you is to diversify your hip-hop collection as well as your musical tastes, so that you'll be able to indicate that acts like this don't last long, its just a quick fix. Half of yall know this dude sucks but you're afraid to admitt it, because you don't want you're peers to call you an oh so dreaded hater. Hip-Hop is now officially on its Death Bed. Thanks to the Demise of real NYC hip hop."
3,I Was Expecting More from the Boy Wonder..,"I've been a g-unit fan since the first mixtape ""50 Cent Is The Future"" in 2002. Before anyone outside of NYC knew who G-Unit was. I was always awaiting the Banks album because he was always the best in g-unit (lyrically). With that being said on with the reviewBesides the current singles..this album is pretty decent with a couple standout tracks like Ain't No Click, Work Magic, If You So Gangsta, and Warrior Pt. 2. The rest of the album is just average at best. Banks needs more substance.. sounds like the same thing in everysong. ** By the way Playboy is 2 old freestyles made in to a song with slightly different lyrics..** (nice try banks..) This album disappointed me. I'd still recommend listening to it though.."
2,COULD HAVE DONE WAY BETTER,"Lloyd banks is the worst rapper of G-unit. I do not know why people love this guy. I mean, I actually like his cd, i'm not going to lie, but he could have done way better. Want to hear a better g-unit cd: listen to young buck."
4,One of the best g unit albums,"I rate this album 8 1/2 out of a 10why? lloyd banks comes of all ""gangster"" and these songs like Karma and Im so fly just tells you that he thinks he's hood im not trying to say he isnt but come on but this album was really good i think he made this album to say look i'm friends with 50 and dre so im going to flash my cash and cars and so onand he really did that this album is buyable but you will want to throw it away when you hear the young buck albumTop 5 song-I'm so fly-Warrior-On Fire-Karma-Ain't no click"
3,Good enough,"This album was good when i say good i mean more good songs then bad but there were some i wasn't feelin, he's definitly talented and i look forward to hearing him in the future."
3,This Cd was nun compared to LLyod banks other Feat.'s,"This cd was iight....but LLyod banks could have done much better, i would still give em 3 star's outha 5.. Holla atcha boy 1"
5,This Shi$,"LLOYD BANKS AND YOUNG BUCK CDS ARE THE TIGHTEST CDS THAT HAVE BEEN RELEASED THIS YEAR. G-UNIT/SHADY AND AFTERMATH ARE THE DEATHROW RECORDS OF THIS DECADE. BESIDES, JADAKISS THESE ARE TWO OF THE HOTTEST OUT RIGHT NOW."
2,Pointless Drivel.,"Ya know what? I'm kind of tired of hearing about how greedy you are, how much money and hoes, how many guns, how much gas you guzzle in your Hummer, how iced out, blah blah blah, whatever, first of all we all know you're being raped by your record company and in 5 years your sorry self will be pulling an MC Hammer, selling the mansion to settle your Cristal debts. Second, you ugly. Third, your album is full of cheap rinky-dink beats that sound like they were produced by a Yamaha Portasound from the 80's.I'm done with hip-hop artists who aren't even remotely interested in ""raising the bar."" Albums like this are utterly forgettable, disposable trash. The next rapper I see with his head in the hundred dollar bill picture frame is going down."
3,A disappointment,"I expected more from Lloyd Banks. From the G-Unit ""Beg For Mercy"" album, I figured him to be the more talented lyricist out of the three members. But now hearing this I have to go with my original assumption that 50 Cent is the most talented (although this may change with the release of Young Buck's album on June 27th).The album starts out fairly strong with the two lead singles within the first four tracks. From there it just seems repetitive. The beats aren't the best in hip-hop, but they do get the job done. Lloyd's lyrics are all the same; money, girls, his gangsta attitude, and getting out of the hood (aside from ""Karma"").It's worth buying if you're a fan of G-Unit, but if you have other album's in mind, pass on this."
5,Why hate??,I don't get these hater.1 4.5/52 2.5/53 3.5/54 4/55 3.5/56 5/57 4.5/58 3/59 5/510 5/511 4.5/512 5/513 2/514 5/5Peace!!
1,what the.........,"what the fock is this bullsh*t, man lloyd just stop yo. your voice is annoying and you cant rhyme. please dont buy this. just download one song and that is warrior. dont waste your money PLEASE!!! buy some 2pac..............dont buy this"
2,I Dont Know What's Going On,"Alright I dont know where Hip-Hop is going. And this latest from the G-Unit camp is not really helping the state of Hip-Hop. Back in the day even if it was gangsta rap, you have cats like DMX that truly represent, and a sound that truly is the street, but this album sounds awful. Tracks like Playboy has an annoying beat and rhymes that's just played out. His voice isnt that great either. If you dont have much to say in Hip-Hop, you should at least have a memorable voice, so at least if you have nothing new to say (which is most of today's hip-hop) people will still listen. Now the only song that I liked here is Warrior, now at least that's a good track, but one song does not an album make. This is sub-par and not worth the money, it just isnt. If you want a good Hip-Hop Album to buy, cop The Roots' new album. C'mon, if anyone is listening, stop buying Hip-Pop, we need real music to fuel our ears.I'm Out!"
2,What Happened?,"Man I was so disappointed when I head this CD. I was expecting it be hot, but what happened? The whole track is nothing but fillers when usually there should only be 2 or 3 at the most. I don't know why in the world someone would recommend Lil Wayne over anything. Goes to show where Hip-Hop is headed. And the only reason I gave it two stars was because he is apart of G-Unit. I save the one stars for the cash money CD's.Overall- D"
1,50 Cent spinoff,"Maaaaannnnnn. This dude is awful. I dont see how everybody is liking what he has to say. All he does, is sing some ole 50 cent sounding hooks all through the CD. Im glad i burned it instead of wasting my money buying it. People are beginning to get caught up into whats in the top 10 on 106 and park, instead of whats really hot. Im expecting for young bucks CD to be a lot better. 5o Cent is really not that hot either. His first CD was straight gangsta, i'll give him that, now he got songs with Joe. And was talking all that mess about Ja Rule for making R&B hits. On the real, Ja would swallow 50 lyric for lyric. anyways, G-unit is a fad cuz 50 got a body, and cuz he been shot, so everybody think he so hard. they wont last too much longer. young buck needs to get down with the youngbloods or someone who can compliment his flow, cuz Banks aint cutting it. the beats are ok, but word for word, line for line, the punch lines are lame, elementary. dont buy this, burn it."
2,Don't waste your money on this,"I have bought this cd, and I want my cd back. First of all when you have a hit album it doesn't means you are an automatic Executive Producer, leave that for P.Diddy, Dr. Dre, Timbaland, Missy, so please 50 cent, first learn, and then produce. This album is in general, bad. The beats are the same, laim. I am very dissapointed."
2,Hype not music,"This guy been hype from the start. He cannot keep my attention after the a couple of bars because he is boring. He say some tight stuff sometimes but he is mainly hype. Go check out that Jadakiss, Slum Village, or Eric Sermon if you want to hear heavyweight music."
3,Not Hot,"Unfortunately, the first single,""On Fire,"" doesn't describe this album. There are a few hot tracks, but too much filler. ""Playboy"", ""Karma"", and ""I'm So Fly"" are trash, and make you ask, ""What the [item]. ""Warrior"", ""Warrior Pt2"", ""Ain't No Click"" are bangin, the rest is alright. If you bought G-Unit's ""Beg for Mercy"" album, and are expecting the same level of Gangsta, you'll be disappointed. The album sounds like a toned down, commercialized version of what could have been a Great Album. I would recommend going to 50centgunit.com and picking up one of the Lloyd Banks mixtapes, they are hotter than this album."
3,What about the other songs,yeah what up with the amazon track list it has too many songs and the real cd doesnt it only has 15 plus a extra tracki'm telling them to change the track list cause it confuses the custimeroverall this cd is not badYOUNG BUCK is way better i like the southern rap
3,Bank$,"after waiting months for the lloyd banks ablum i have to say it had a lot of hype and wasnt wut i was expecting still i'd say its a good ablum.. half the songs i heard already on mixtapes but the ones that stand out are warrior part 1 and 2 Aint no Click Feat. Tony Yayo, When the chips are down Feat. The Game I Get high Feat. 50 & Snoop and work magic feat. young buck"
5,GREAT! Debut Album,Lloyd Banks is by far the best in g-unit when it comes to punch lines he is a king but some times his songs don't have much of a story just talking bout jewels and weed but when it does come to stories he is a great teller in the the track South Side Story he is talking bout when he lived in southside jamaica queens it is a very good cd i am very glad i bought it this will definately light up the charts... every tracks stands out on here except for two which were I Get High and Playboy i don't know why i wasn't feeling those tracks but on I Get High 50 and Snoop ruin the song because of the talent they lack and on the song Playboy it's just really the beat i am unable to get into... This is a great album you should definately cop this! Peace
4,Why not-I will review from others views,All music guide gave this album 3.5 stars and the First singles were good and others were called good so I will give this album a 4 star rating.Lloyd Banks has a lot of heart not the best Flow.You can either win a point or lose some its your choice.
4,Money in the Bank,"This is a solid release. Not as good as 50's debut, but better than G-Unit's Beg For Mercy. All in all, a very solid album.Ain't No Click feat. Tony Yayo - 5/5Playboy - 4/5Warrior - 5/5On Fire - 5/5I Get High feat. 50 Cent and Snoop Dogg - 3/5I'm So Fly - 4/5Work Magic feat. Young Buck - 4.5/5If You So Gangsta - 4/5Warrior, Part 2 feat. Eminem, 50 cent, and Nate Dogg - 5/5Karma - 4/5When The Chips Are Down feat. Game - 5/5Til The End - 5/5Die One Day - 4/5South Side Story - 4/5"
1,WHY!!!!!!!!,"This is the last straw. This makes my hair want to fall out. You guys can't be serious. Does anybody know hip-hop anymore? Lloyd Banks can't rap a lick. His ryhmes are very elementary. His flow is one dimensional. His punch lines are so lame and most of them don't even make sense. If you bought this album or even bootlegged it you need to be hung by your pinky toe. I'm going to leave with this quote from ""On Fire""- I'm buying diamonds by the pair/bu when you stop the only thing still spinning is your ear. ENOUGH SAID!!"
4,This album is hot!!,"This is a great album from Lloyd! My favorites are Karma, Work Magic, and I'm So Fly.1.Ain't No Click-3/52.Playboy-3/5-Is this supposed to be a sexual song?3.Warrior-4/54.On Fire-5/5-Good first single.5.I Get High-3/56.I'm So Fly-5/57.Work Magic-5/5-My second favorite song.8.If You So Gangsta-3/59.Warrior 2-4/510.Karma-6/5-My favorite song on this album.11.When The Chips Are Down-3/512.Til The End-3/513.Die One Day-3/514.South Side Story-4/5-Okay song. Better than most songs.Go get this album! Bye."
3,3.5 Stars,"BEST G-UNIT RAPPER HANDS DOWN!!! Lloyd Banks has incredible talent but still lacks when it comes to versatility. The Hunger For More is a great album, although it still dissapointed me. I expected better from the G-Unit lyricist, but overall it's a MUST BUY."
3,Here is a Rebuttal to Papa Papa's reviews of Lloyd Banks,"I own this album and I can tell you that this album is pretty good. Not the greatest that I've heard of course. But, it is good. Here you claim your a critic of Rap and Hip Hop. Do you relize that all you've been doing, is critisizing the west coast you gave reference to Public Enemy, and a few others as being, great rappers If you knew anything about rap and hip Hop then you would know the differances between West, East, And the South, Being that you're from London You probably only know what you buy or what you get off the internet. Maybe you need to study up on you're history of rap and Hip Hop. Yes, I agree there is alot of crap floating around the rap industry, but if you're gonna be a critic or a reviewer. Review the music not the whole entire industry. Yes, you are entitled to like what you like, but the music industry is doing, that it has always done-That's entertain the"
2,EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED!!!,"I cant believe I wasted my money on this album. This is one of the worst albums I have heard all year.I thought that the beats would be hot and a little bit uptempo but instead all I got was a bunch wack beats and slow lyrics. There are about 3-4 songs I like ""warrior"",""warrior pt 2"" and ""on fire"". I thought he could do better. I have heard better stuff from him on mixed tapes. Maybe if he used Dr. Dre he would have done better, but instead he used some D-grade producers whose beats sound like they weremade in somebody's basement. I think he tried too hard to live up to 50's debut and don't believe the hype, just because it sold 430,000 copies in the 1st week doesnt make it hot.However Iam a loyal 50/G-unit always."
1,Kick him out of G-Unit,"I am like the biggest fan of g-unit and eminem. This cd is terrible there are like three songs on it worth litening to and thats bc they have 50 and eminem in them...Warrior remix, On Fire, and I'm so fly. I mean seriously why is he part of g-unit he is no kinda gansta he is just weak to fit in with the rest of the group....you wanna hear a good g-unit cd either The Game - Tha Documentary, or Young Buck - Straight outta Cashville....man just give it up Banks"
2,I am hungry for more,The title of this album was exactly what I was feeling after listening to this album. I expected a lot more out of Banks. I bought the cd hoping to be one of the best hip-hop albums of the year but it turns out that it was sub-par. I know you have probably heard this many times but I have to agree that Banks is just full of punch lines. I espected this album to have the beats from get rich and die tryin with some good lyrical content. I am disappointed Banks could have come ten times harder
4,LLOYD BANKS.. IS ILL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I MEAN.. I AINT SAYIN THAT HE'S ILL CUZ I'M ONE OF THEM G UNIT HEADZ.. AND I'M JUST SAYIN THAT BANKZ IS ILL LIKE.. . HE'S LYRICZ.... HE'S FLOW... HE'S PUNCHLINEZ....................HE'S PRODUCTIONBANKS IS ILL!!!!!!!!!! AND I AINT ONE OF THESE G UNIT HEADZ....THE BEST FROM G UNIT....!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,Mediocore.,"Its an ok album, Lloyd is a good artist, he needs to come up with more lyrics rather then rap about the same ol thing everytime. Young Buck is the best of the group, he has what it takes and in my opinion he is what keeps G-Unit going."
2,nothing but dissapointment,"When Banks annouced that he was coming out with the album earlir this year, anticipation were high for this 21 year old rapper. after all, he is lyrically the most talented one out of the whole group. But wen i bought this cd, i found my self keep skipping track after track. The only good songs are warrior, Warrior part two and Karma, Eminem definitly outshines Lloyd in the Cd with his lyrical and production skills. The Album in general is pure garbage with nothing but filler tracks, Production on the cd is weak except for the two Eminem produced tracks. I would not recommend this cd since it only has 14 tracks and 11 of them are fillers. Maybe Young bucks album will be woth the buying when it comes out."
3,3 1/2 Stars,"This album i really was looking forward to because i loved lloyd banks style from the moment i heard him and when i first listened to this album i absolutely loved it i thought he lived up to all my expectations..but after i listened to it for a few times it got boring like really fast not to say its a bad album because its not it just didnt last thats all, if you could just borrow this cd from someone for about 3 weeks or so then thats all you'll need with it. Dont take this as a bad review or a good review for that matter just in my opinion this cd wont last in your collection."
5,Amazing Album,"Lloyd Banks is hands down the best rapper in G-Unit. His rhymes are smooth and yet hardcore. Everytime I listen to that cd I am amazed at how good he is. The best song on the album is Till The End. Listen to it, and tell me it doesnt give you chills"
1,THIS F@CKIN SUX,I can't belive that any of you can say that this is a good album all i'am gonna say is this album is f@uckin ish
4,Imperssing But Not a Classic,"I like Banks. I think he has better rap skills than 50. But the difference between them is the fact that 50 is smart. Not saying that Banks isn't, 50 had people buy into his hype. He knows how to sell his music without having the nice skills like Banks. Plus it was hard for Banks because he was in 50 shadow. But he proves many people wrong on his album. The only thing I think Banks need to work on is the choruses in his songs. He's use to 50 laying down the chorus and the album would have been a lot better if the choruses were better. But other than that the album was pretty descend."
3,"I Like Buck Better, But Still . . .","I kind of like G-Unit, but then again I kind of don't. I can't explain it, but I already had in my mind that I wouldn't buy this album, because of my kind of don't side. But, my sister persuaded me to get it. I saw it at Sam Goody for $11.99 and figured I wouldn't get it anywhere else cheaper, new. I bought it, listened to all of the songs, and well it isn't as bad as I thought. My favorite songs so far are Karma, Warrior, and On Fire. I'm sure after I listen to the album front to back a few more times something else will grab me. By the way, to all whom are skeptical about buying this album, I think you should stay that way. I recommend this to the hardcore and semi-hardcore G-Unit fans."
2,Rollin on 16s,"Now I aint putting nothing out, I smoke when I wanna26-inch chrome spokes on the HummerThis heat gon last for the whole summerRunning your bitch faster then the Road RunnerRocks on my wrist, rolls gold underGlocks on my hip, those throw thunderWow!!! Rims, Hummers, Rocks, Glocks! Ohh how creative you are Mr. Banks! There is nothing quite like bragging about the stupid rims on your Hummer or better yet the Glock on your hip-great role model you are...every child in America should aspire to be more like you. Just another mindless rap album with no substance-the beats are produced well, but still mediocre."
2,"All hype, medicore at best","After all the hype about Lloyd Banks, the ""Hunger for More"" is mediocre at best. For the last 6 months all I have heard is how great Lloyd Banks is, but his first cd hardley delivers on the hype. The first single ""fire"" is basically your generic club record for the ladies, as is the awful ""karma"". I find it quite humerous that G-Unit used to make fun of Ja Rule for doing RnB flavored records for the ladies, and it seems that the last bunch of G-Unit singles have all been on the ""thugs-in-love""/Ja Rule level. Although there are a handful of tracks that deliver on the hype (ie Warrior), Lloyd Banks has trouble holding down a whole album with his monotone sounding flow, which gets tiresome after awhile. I am sure this album will sell based on popularity of G-Unit, however, this is hardly the Classic that was talked about. Furthermore, it hardly lives up to the massive hype that Lloyd banks has recieved."
1,Huh???,"I can't believe the reviews I'm reading. Lloyd Banks the best lyricist?????? Yeah RIGHT!!!! The only thing that keeps me from falling asleep to his monotone flow is when he sounds like he's whining.....and that just keeps me awake long enough to turn it off. You wanna hear some real hip hop and not the bubble gum, poppy, fake, wannabe rap that's so popular these days? Pick up Immortal Technique Revolutionary Vol 1 and 2. You might learn something. Peace."
3,Not TOO Bad,"I bought this CD today in high hopes, it wasn't nearly as good as I thought but he still delivers some good rhymes. By listening to this you can definetly tell that he is with 50 Cent and G-Unit due to his street sense. My favorite track on this album is the first single ""On Fire"" and others include ""Karma"" and ""I'm So Fly."" In a lot of his songs all he raps about is smoking weed which is quite typical and that is where I see the album at its low points because it seems he runs out of things to say at times. I say listen to this album online first, and then see if you want to pay the money for it."
1,wack album,"this album sucks now i can understand why g-unit are so pop, banks is trying ryhme everything anyway he can! what the hell is going on. thank god this 12 year old girl brought this album of me lol."
4,Quite a good debut,Lloyd Banks debut comes a few months after Beg 4 Mercy. After hearing Banks on quite a few mixtapes this for me does not live up to my expectations. I would say only 1/2 of the tracks were real Banks quality. Quite disappointing.
3,The new 50 cent album,"I knew he could not live up to all the hype. this guy sounds like a more lyrical 50 cent, i mean their albums are almost exactly alike. Only reason i gave it a 3 is because it does have a few good tracks (mostly with somebody else on it). Let us learn our lesson with this one please, Hip-hop is for the stand up types not the ""i'm with him"" types."
5,check it out,ok 1st off everyone saying its not a classic its not like Reasonable Doubt and Illmatic were classics after the 2 weeks they came out half you guys probably never even heard of nas and jayz until there 2nd cd came outand its sad because the cd had such high hopes that people aren't even giving it a chance i have to listen to cds like 10 times to even get to like them some timesthe dynasty album i hated until 6 months after blue print 1 came out i started listening to it and now its in my top 3 jay z cd's but if your going to buy it don't have high hopes for it off the bat just buy it and listen
1,1/4 of 50 cent,"I am not going to call him lloyd anymore, he is just 12.5 cents. The beats are hot. I can't wait for the instrumental cd, so I can give them to my artist BlacK Ginger (www.blackgingeronline.com).one"
2,Whatever...,"Lloyd Banks is an idiot. Don't get this album. His raps are boring, most of the beats suck, and um.....he's ugly. Whatever, just don't get this unless you want people to hate you."
3,A huge disappointment.,"this guy sounds like hes 60. But i gave him a try after all of his good old stuff. here is a rating of all the songs,Aint No Click- 8.5/10Playboy- 8/10Warrior- 7.5/10On Fire- 10/10I Get High- 6/10I'm So Fly- 10/10Work Magic- 9/10I'm So Gangsta- 8/10Warrior Pt.2 - 9.5/10When The Chips Down- 7/10Til The End- 9/10Die One Day- 5/10- The worst beat ive ever heardSouth Side Story- 7/10Karma- 10/10"
