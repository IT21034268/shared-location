1,Won't Run Under Windoze 7,"This is legacy software. Good for Vista, XP, 98. Won't run under Windoze 7. Won't install or run using wine with Linux."
2,Not for high crime areas,Had this lock for the past year. This past weekend someone broke into our secure parking area and stole several bikes. Bolt cutters went right through the loop and the cable (I still have the parts). $2800 bike gone. I did not realize it was that easy to compromise. Low crime areas you're probably fine. Big city? Forget it. Get something stronger.
4,Kryptonite lock,"Solid lock. Haven't had any issues with it. Was shipped in original product box. Comes with two keys, flex cable. Overall, good product that works, I would recommend this product and the seller."
3,"oops, doesn't fit","If your buying this switch for a 200sx, note that it's for the 2.0 engine not the 1.6! The correct model for the 1.6 appears to be the ns99. Hope this helps so others can avoid my mistake/impulse purchase:)"
1,Disappointing experience,"I bought the Stylus 100 specifically for my trip to China. It started ""eating film"" in the 4th roll. I was unable to take any more pictures in China until I finally came upon a disposable - not an easy find. The pictures I did get developed were lackluster, and I wish I could just start over with a different camera. Unfortunately, my only recourse it to have it repaired. I would not recommend this camera."
4,One Thing to Say,"I live in Victoria, I was 11 when the crime happened and it was horrific to hear about. But we do not live on Victoria Island as Godfrey keeps stating. This bothered me during the book, one rather large factual error. It's Vancouver Island for all of you who don't know any different."
5,Gripping Read,"This book was incredible. To use an accurate cliche, I couldn't put it down. As I read, I felt as though I came to know each ""character"", and while I definitely didn't like each one, I felt as though the author was presenting me with an understanding of their separate motivations. Godfrey managed to weave together a complex subject involving more than two dozen people, a confusing night, a morass of lies and gossip and denial, somehow bringing it all into the light. I kept wondering how long she'd had to research, and how many people she must have interviewed during the course of the writing. Godfrey writes of jealousy, love, vanity, fear, violence, and tragedy in an understandable way. She also keeps the reader in suspense, revealing each bit of this real-life plot slowly so the reader experiences the tension, uncertainity, and need to know that many of the (unfortunate) real-life particpants must also have felt."
3,"Well done, but done wrong","I'm not going to argue that this case was well-documented here. You got a feel for the victim and alleged criminals, even felt as though you knew them. The crime was unspeakable, especially considering how small a thing it was the victim died for.What most find a strong point--the fact the novel was written like a fictional piece--is what I believe to be the failing point. At times I put down the book only to realize that I still didn't believe this to be a ""true"" crime story. It seemed TOO fictional; sometimes TOO in touch with the players. To be honest, I enjoyed this as a piece of fiction, not as a fascinating documentary of a senseless murder--and that is not something I particularly look for in this genre."
3,"Good subject, poor delivery.","This is a pretty fascinating account of Yukio Mishima's life and eventual suicide seppuku style. As far as the amazing real life story of Mishima and the amazing history of Japan goes, this book should have been 5 stars. The reason I only gave it three is the author's self-indulgent, ""I'm sooo cool because I know about japanese culture and kendo"", attitude and writing style. You have to read %50 percent of the book hearing about this guy's stay in japan and martial arts routines.I appreciate the attempt to write more than just a biography, but when it comes down to it, who do you want to read about? Mishima or some cocky british japanophile?"
3,Whatever with that...,"Well, the author is right about one thing: what poets do mostly is whine. It seems like he spends the whole book showing off (either how many fancy words he knows or how down he is with the local gangsters). Oh well. At least the Blacks and Chicanos get along together in HIS neighborhood! Still, some of it is funny and some of it is weird enough to be true"
5,A right on slam dunk!,"If you've been dragged through the US school system, you gotta read this! An absolutely relentless social critique directed towards racism, those who exert it, and those who put up with it. Hilarious and gutsy enough to use the N-word, unmatched since Mark Twain. Extreme caricatures named Psycho Loco, mail order brides, an out-of-the-slum hero; Beatty's got it all. Worship the novel!"
5,Excellent,"This book works on so many it deseves to be read multiple times---Humor, satire, irony. This book has it all. It has moved to my personal top ten list."
1,The White Boy Shuffle,"A very disappointing book. No question that Beatty's somewhat of a polymath but that doesn't carry the book. I found myself saying ""OK, you're young, bright, black, and pissed, what else've you got?"" His attitude isn't enough to carry the book and the narrative is exceedingly thinÑit's not constructed to involve the reader even slightly. His incorporation of fantasy elements doesn't work and serves only to further distance the reader from the characters. If you're looking for bright fantasy along similar lines which is MUCH better realized and which pulls you into the story, read some Ishmael Reed such as Yellowback Radio Brokedown, Mumbo Jumbo, or The Last Days of Panama Red. Perhaps Beattyll improve with ageÑ there's little doubt that he's gifted, but his gifts are too rawly displayed here; theres not much narrative integration and very little craft. Its rare that I dont finish a book but I finally gave up about 80% of the way through."
5,hilarious,"found this book in a flea market bargain bin amoungst soggy danielle steele novels and i haven't stopped laughing since. believe what all those other people are saying; pay the eight dollars and buy the book. please. if ""the white boy shuffle"" doesn't kill you, it'll only make you stronger."
3,Way too disjointed,"First let me begin by saying that I only completed this book because I wanted to know the outcome of all of the characters. Withers takes the lives of six friends (whose first intials spell f-r-i-e-n-d-s) and tries to explore how the choices they make affect their lives. In principle, this is a good idea. However, each chapter is in a different voice and by the time you get to Synthia you have forgotten all about Felicity. At times, it looks like the author gets confused. In one whole chapter she refers to Ione when this is really one of the other characters story. Not too mention there is just too much relationship drama here. The two married women are both adultresses and ruin their marriages and the other four women are not relationship models either. We have suicide resulting from a relationship, single parenting and not to mention several of them date married men."
3,Nice try-overall good book,Although the book does provide a great storyline there are far too many characters making it difficult for the reader to follow. I found myself constantly having to refer back to the introduction to keep up with the characters. This book is in need of MUCH EDITING as to why I only gave the book three stars. Overall this is a good book and I'm sure with experience the author will improve on her gift of writing.
5,love this,I have extremely senitive skin and almost all lotions and face cream cause either a allergic reaction or just sit there like congeled fat. I had tried everything from cheap to expensive and this product is the best I have ever found. Nearly 40 years old and no wrinkles. I have been using this product for only 10 years.
4,"great Rer-freshing"" retro","Still a great listen, regardless of years gone by.""After the Gold Rush"" a cappela version is a classic.Imagine, you can actually understand every word of the songs.What a breath of ""re-freshed"" air."
4,Good flower box for injoying your balcony,"Good flower box, light weight and convenient size, has holes for good drainage. I bought 6 of them and they look pretty good installed with brackets on a balcony railing. You even do not need a tray under this box if you do not use too much water for your flowers."
5,Oldie But Goodie!!!,"This is an older exercise Video (1995)...but it is as good today as it was back then... This is an intermmediate workout. I love the fact that it has a warm up and stretching at the end...I notice that many exercise videos do not have a warm up or cool down..you just go right into the exercise and that's a good way to get injured. Rod Styker narrates this video, he has the most calming voice. This is a great video.... I would highly recommend it!!!"
1,Disappointing,"The box claims this video is appropriate for intermediate to advanced yoga practicioners. It is wrong! I was extremely disapointed. The video is, in fact, more appropriate for not-quite beginners. I was so irritated that the video didn't live up to its claims that I took it back to the store and demanded a refund. (I got it!)"
3,Challenging!,"I'ld been doing Ali McGraw's yoga video (the best!) for about 6 months, and wanted something more challenging for a change of pace. Kathy Smiths was just what I wanted. More upper body strenghth moves, more intense stretches. The instruction is often confused on right and left, and the tape appears inverted so you can't watch and copy. This makes it a little harder to learn, but I find it a good alternative when I want to do something different!"
3,Never Knew What To Expect Next,"I am not a beginner of video workouts. But I found this one confusing. By confusing I mean, I never knew the next step. I enjoyed the music but I was just jumping around and since Richard did not show nor tell you what kind of step you were going to be doing I could not get in sync with the tape. I prefer those videos that have more explicit instructions."
3,Richard Simmons- Sweat & Shout,Was disappointed that this was the same tape as Sweatin' to the Oldies 4 otherwise it has great songs and great energy.
3,workout,First time trying the video. He's just as goofy as I am when having fun. Glad I tried it. The best part about it is that I'm not dead tired and out of breath from exercising.
2,ZawiLUL?,"Zawinul = Zawilul (in Dutch Lul=Cock).I don't know, its his face.The music with Miles and Weather Report: OKAs solo-""star"": trash.(Not so for bassman Richard Bona on this cd!!!)"
4,Good Basics,"I'm using this text for college level introductory course in Syntax. The book is a really good source for the basics of X-Bar theory. A few of the concepts lack clear examples, but overall it does a great job of explaining things. In fact, it's clarity (for the most part) helps me sort out what my professor is blathering about. I refer to the book more than my class notes for help in analysing data.I think this is a great book for both students and also those with an interest in linguistics and would like to pursue Syntax in more depth."
4,After Several Years I've Finally Decided I like it,"I've owned this video for several years and viewed it before reviewing it. It includes several Bob Hope show episodes that Lucy and Desi were on including a rare ""I Love Lucy"" episode with Bob Hope playing Ricky and Desi playing Fred and Bill Frawley playing a captain. The highlights of it is the ""Westing House"" promotion with Lucy trying to get new things for her dressing room. My favorite thing was a 1953 ad for perms with Lucy and Desi. It's the very last thing on the tape. The quality of the video is very grainy and sometimes it might be hard to see some things at times but it's not all like that. I'd give it 5 stars if the grain wasn't so bad at times. It's a great video!"
5,Lucys Lost Episodes,This was very nice to see. Lucy in some of her Guest appearances in others shows along with commercials not only for National products but the indorsement she made for charitable organizations. Lucy was quite the humanitarian with her charity work for the heart fund and cerebral palsy. All the more reason to love Lucy!
4,Great Workout! But looking for more cool-down,"I am pretty new to regular home exercise and really like Kathy Smith's approach. Took me a couple of tries to get the moves down - some I'm still working on, but it's a great workout! Highly recommend it. However, I'm still looking for a good cool down/stretch workout to add after the aerobic section. Recommendations anyone?"
4,Really Burns the Fat and Gets you Moving,"I enjoyed this exercise DVD, the only problem I had was learning the moves, they are not easy but with practice I think I can get them! It does work you and makes you sweat."
4,"Fun, Easy Workout!","I recently had a baby, and needed something quick and easy to do while he napped. The steps are fairly easy to learn after a couple times, and I feel that it is a very good workout. Also, you have the option of just doing a 20 minute routine, or doing both parts for a longer workout. I honestly never do the second routine, but it is a bit harder, and I don't like the choreography as much as the first half. Also, there is a cool down stretch routine and diet advice at the end which is really good. Overall I would recommend this workout to those who dont have a lot of time to spare but want a good cardiovascular workout!"
2,EXTREMELY CHALLENGING,Kathy Smith has some wonderful exercise videos but this particuliar video was very complicated for me to do! The steps was too fast and I couldn't catch on. I would highly recommend this video to an individual who is seasoned in doing aerobics...if your a beginner...you might want to try something a bit simplier that Kathy has to offer.
2,"gets your heart rate up, but not very enjoyable","This video has some value because it gets your heart rate up and has some nice strengthening moves, but people with any rhythm will have a hard time following Kathy Smith, who has none. She also does not let you know in advance what the next move will be, she simply jumps into it which gets confusing.Simply doing one 20-minute segment will be probably be insufficient for people who are in reasonably good shape. Also, you need a lot of space to do the routine because it requires a lot of moving around."
3,Not so....,"This is the first aerobics video I bought. I was hoping for some moves that were not so hard to follow-indeed, the first workout wasn't that hard (to follow), but I just could not do the second one. I also have to agree with what the others said about the ""wooing crowd"" in the background-it's really annoying. Don't get me wrong-Kathy Smith is really great and you'll be able to do the first workout after the 3rd time-but all in all it's not really what I expected to get for the money I paid. I'll keep on looking and when I've found something better I'll let you know.Until then I will practice the workout so that I can actually have the TV on mute while I'm working out with that tape."
3,decent workout but tricky,"Was looking for a thorough cardio workout with some dance elements. While it does provide a decent workout the steps are often not easy and sometimes difficult to see properly. Also, I found the whooping and loud ""oh-yeas"" from some of the backround team extremely annoying - almost turned the video off after 10 minutes as I wanted to scream ""shut the hell up!"" at the offending member/s. :-)"
2,Disappointing,"I own many Kathy Smith videos and this one is far by the worst. This workout includes two 20 minute workouts, a 10 minute stretch, and a very short section on snacking (DVD bonus). The first aerobic workout is progressive in intensity, the other has short cardio bursts to increase the heart rate. The moves are quite complicated and often clumsy, the music isn't very good either. Generally disappointing."
4,I like it,"I really like Kathy Smith, even though she is always letting out cheesy hoots and squeals. (It gives me something to make fun of when I workout.) I like this DVD because I can do either or both sections and still get a good workout. On days when I only do one, I still have time to follow up with a Lotte Berk Method DVD for toning. I didn't have a problem following the steps and there aren't many moves that ""form"" needs to be demonstrated on.The second workout is good, but its hard to follow the modifiers. They don't show many clear shots of them. Going off of what Kathy says and the weird camera angles, don't expect to get the modifications perfectly the first time through. I had to stop and watch and then join back in."
5,Terrific quick workouts...if only I liked aerobics a little more,"If I *did* like aerobics a little more, I would do this workout every day. It's high-energy and very speedy, and I've liked Kathy Smith as a leader since I watched my mom do her tapes when I was little. When I do this workout for a few weeks, I see the difference. Recommended."
3,Check your age,Check your age at the door. This is good if you are 20-30 years old. Me? Hey I'm over the hill and need something slower.
1,Definitely NOT for a beginner!,"I purchased this DVD after reading all the wonderful reviews and was under the impression that the steps would be easy to follow. I couldn't have been more wrong! I just put the DVD in and she went through the introduction to her program which sounded great! Then the first ""Low impact"" section began. Low impact? She and her ""crew"" started by flailing their arms and legs all around in a high impact aerobic workout. Not even explaining the moves at all. I guess you need to just sit on your butt and watch these routines for a couple weeks before you can attempt to start to get in shape! I thought maybe there was a mistake and it accidently started on the high-impact section first so I went back to the menu and picked the low intensity workout and it was no mistake - it was just way too hard to follow. I became frustrated and just took the DVD out and put Walk Away the Pounds with Leslie Sansone back in. I recommend that instead of this. What a waste of money!"
1,Save your money!,"I recently bought this DVD as well as Kathy Smith's lift weights to lose weight, and I have to say both are huge disapointments! I am relatively fit and used to exercising but these DVDs do nothing for me - in fact if you could rate them in the negatives I would! The choreography is messy, there are so many people jumping around it is hard to see what you are meant to be doing at any given time. The camera jumps from shot to shot so quickly that a lot of guess work has to be done in order to keep moving! I have had a lot of success with other DVDs like Leslie Sansones Walk away the pounds, and I would have to say that even though they may be monotonous after a while, they are certainly better choreographed and filmed, and all in all a lot more effective which is what counts!"
2,Definitely below average,"I think my main mistake was to try out this video for the very first time at 6 a.m. I should have waited until I was more alert. By yawning for a second too long I think I missed half the routine. I mastered about half the moves by the 3rd or 4th time using this tape, so one can expect the steps to be quite challenging for newbies. Kathy runs through each move *very* quickly (mercy if you must pause for a sip of water), so pay very close attention. I honestly think I'd have better things to say about this program if I could just get past all the annoying whoops and you-GO-girl yelps from her MC Hammer-like entourage. They need to go away (or shut up). Bottom line: If you have a knack for picking up fast-paced moves, this tape will give you a pretty decent workout -- it's hi-enegery and will make you sweat. Otherwise, stick with something more intermediate."
1,Tae Bo meets a night at the dance club,"I was disappointed with this video especially since I thought I had two reputable recommendations, Parents magazine and Shape magazine. This tape is rated for beginners to intermediate. I beg to differ. I've participated in my fair share of aerobics classes and I had a difficult time following the moves. Therefore, I wasn't able to get a good work-out. You wonder what you're accomplishing. A night at the dance club would do as much. In addition, the tape is noisy. Similar to a Tae Bo tape. For all you moms out there trying to get in a quick work-out, this is not the tape for if you've had enough noise for the day. This one is going back on the shelf."
4,Really a Timesaver,"This workout is really great for those days that you can not get up in the morning. You can still catch those 20 minutes of workout. Kathy is both enegetic and keeps you going. I don't recommend this video for everyday because I don't feel that I get enough of a calorie burn, but 20 minutes of workout is better than no workout at all!"
3,Get a Different Kathy Workout!,"This tape is one of my least favorite Kathy tapes and I rarely use it now. The moves are more showy than her other workouts and that is not a good thing. It is pretty easy to learn after a few times but the moves are still more complex than her other tapes. Bottom line: I don't feel like I am getting the best workout for my time and with what little time we all have, I recommend her Peak Fat Burning tape."
2,"Too fast, not enough instruction","I have read great things about Kathy Smiths' workout videos and didn't think twice about ordering Timesaver Cardio Fat Burner DVD. However, I was surprised how fast she went through instruction. I am in pretty good physical shape and thought her cardio was sufficent. The issue I have is that she went so fast through the combos that I spent more time stopping the DVD then the actual workout. This DVD would be better off in the hands of the more coordinated."
5,Fun Dancy Hi-Lo Cardio!,"I only have a few pure floor hi-lo workouts because I am choreography-challenged. I am really glad Kathy came up with this one. There are two 20 minute segments. First segment is a low-impact dance cardio and the second segment is more hi-impact with some tricky steps. I don't think this is a pure beginner video because of the tricky steps. But if I was able to get it down in a few tries, I'm sure anyone will. I will rate this entire workout as intermediate. However, I will rate second segment as intermediate/advanced because of the higher impact and the tricky moves. Kathy is more energetic in this video so if you prefer a more somber and subdued Kathy then this workout is not for you. I prefer energetic instructors especially when doing cardio so this doesn't bug me. I hope Kathy makes another hi-lo workout soon! TWO THUMBS UP!"
4,It's worth the investment,"Like the other reviews I had a difficult time getting the hang of the steps, it was however, pretty fun to watch my friend attempt to do the dvd, after I had gotten the hang of it. I think the background ""crew"" are irritating, but with that many folks of all differant shapes and sizes it provides some options. Especially in the 2nd workout, which has ""cardio bursts"" that allow you to work at a greater intensity.This video has a lot of options, doesn't require any special equiptment & isn't going to bore you after the first few attempts. It's worth the effort to pick up the steps and give it a try."
4,"oh, yeah! get started!","Finally a w/o for beginners! I have done very well with this one,and on days that I feel I can do more, there is a second 20 minute w/o. Try this: w/o in your underwear in front of a full length mirror! Sure has pushed me! I can complete this w/o 6 days a week-and knowing its only 20 minutes...piece of cake! I actually like the ""mess ups"" made by some of the folks on tape-seems like real people!"
3,"Some fun moves, but not as good as some of her other videos.","I am an avid Kathy Smith fan and was somewhat disappointed with this video. There is no warm-up or stretching at the beginning and although it's fast paced and some of the moves are fun to do, I found the second 20-minute session hard to follow and frustrating. Also, the loud shouting of participants and poor editing quality of this video are very annoying. The cuts to closeups use a soft focus filter and throw you completely off. I would not have expected this from kathy Smith."
4,Kathy Smith Timesaver workout,This is a must have for any high intensity fan. It is fun and keeps your heart rate up for the full 20 or 40 minutes. Completely satisfying and energizing. I combine this video with the Timesaver weight workout for an even better workout. I highly recommend..
5,Very high energy,"I really like this routine. It is very high energy, gets your heart pumping. I am always sweaty afterwards. One of the best things about this routine is that it can be done in a small area. Not much moving outside a large box. I think the cueing is great and the music is fun. The people in the back ground are not as bad as some ""mechanical people"" in other videos. They all have on different outfits, which is nice. There is no beginning warm up, that is just something that I do on my own. For a beginner, just learning to work out, that is not good. You should learn about form and technique. The 7 minute strech at the end is wonderful. Very relaxing. The lullaby music in this segment is calming. Nice way to end the workout.I am not a fan of Kathy, but I really enjoy this workout."
3,"A decent workout, but will someone shut those people up!","I am a Kathy Smith fan and have several of her tapes. This is a decent workout but not as timesaving as one might think. There are no warmup or cool down sections so it actually takes me about 40 minutes to do a segment. I like section 2 but cannot stomach section 1 because of the annoying group of exercisers whooping it up and shouting things. They should be seen, to illustrate technique and make you feel like you're in a class, but not heard!"
1,I wish I could give no stars,"I have several Kathy Smith videos this is the absolute worse! I agree with some of the other reviewers that Kathy has not rhythm and in this video the steps do not match the beat of the music which makes it frustrating and makes her look very uncoordinated. Also, it seems like there a too many people in such a small space, the whole set looks very chaotic. I wonder if Kathy thought up the choreography for this one herself, it is very poor. All those crazy shuffle moves! Any other Kathy Smith workout will be better for you than this one."
5,My Favorite Aerobic Workout of all TIme!!,"Once I did this video a couple times through I got all the ""moves"" down. I never tire of it and if I do the 40 minutes straight through I really feel as though I got to my target heart rate (and then some). I ALWAYS go back to this video because it is SO much fun to do. I LOVE IT!!"
3,Not my favorite in her series of videos,"I do not particularly like this video. It is fast-paced, but the music, editing, and most of the participants are annoying. The moves are more complicated on carpet, but manageable. I found her stretching section to be much less satisfying than what I have seen on her others, such as her earlier fat-burning workout."
1,I love Kathy Smith but this tape is annoying,"The tape is suspiciously cheery, upbeat and nauseating at times. I didn't like it when the other people took turns giving instrucitons because there's no point and its confusing. Its a complicated routine, painful on the joints and not very fun. I like her power step, step, and funcitonally fit peak fat burning tapes. This tape is too trendy for me, it made me feel like a cheerleader slash ego-obsessed-yuppie-feak while I was doing it, much like the rest of her crew."
2,Not as happy with this one,"I love Kathy Smith's videos. I have several which I do as often as time allows. I've had this one for a number of years, but since I favor her step tapes I hadn't really given this one a try. Until recently that is and I was disappointed with it. She goes right into the work out and doesn't do a warm up, which is unusual for her. It made a difference for me. I stopped doing the tape and haven't done it since."
2,Don't like the backup crew,"When I first popped this tape in, I didn't like it at all. I have other Kathy Smith tapes, and she usually does an excellent job of paying attention to the body to help prevent injuries. Not with this one. You have to warm up on your own first, and once you do get started the moves are awkward enough you can easily twist an ankle or knee. Although I think I might eventually get used to the moves, I'm not sure I'll ever get used to the overcrowded crew constantly ""whoo-ing"" in the background. Some call that motivating, I call it distracting and annoying."
3,What's with the crowd of people on the set?,"Though I'm not completely unhappy with this video, it rarely gets picked (and I usually work out twice a day to an assortment of videos). There are too many people on the set with Kathy, which makes it difficult to focus on a modifier. Since I have a slight issue with a knee, I usually like to start high-energy aerobic videos with the modifier until I become familiar with the routine. I also don't like that the cast members can be heard almost as much as Kathy - it's distracting when trying to learn a new and fast-paced routine. So, even though I think I may enjoy the workout eventually (if I actually pick it, that is), if I want a fun, sweaty workout I stick with Mari Winsor's ""Fat Burning"" sequence from her ""Maximum Burn Basics/Fat Burning"" DVD, which I purchased around the same time - Mari is much better at talking to her modifier the entire time, and even though she has about the same number of people on set with her, it doesn't hinder the workout."
5,Hi energy cardio fun,"This workout will really rev up your engines, even if you only do the 20 min starter. I usually complete the full 40 minutes, and I have alot of fun, which is what exercise should be. In the first segment the moves are all low-impact, and are progressively added to make up a fun quick workout. In the second 20 min section the moves are more challenging, and there's an option to do high-impact moves. This is not a beginner video, but it's also not impossible to master. Alot of the moves are repeated so you catch on quickly by the end of the segment. There's little or no warm-up in the beginning, but I think that's part of what makes it a time saving but effective video--the working out starts right away. Kathy Smith is perky without being annoying, and is working out with a ton of people. You won't get bored by this video and it will definitely get you sweating."
4,Warning,"It is a great workout and beats many tapes that I own. After 8 years of aerobics at the gym, I switched to video and never looked back. Her tapes help me to stay in shape and work out more often.Couple things that threw me off:Kathy ignores the fact that many of us practice aerobics at home on the carpet. Some of her moves are hard to do on the carpet at high pace. I would appreciate a ""carpet edition"" of her video.Second, for some strange reason, she does not always follow symmetrical approach so common for all the aerobics instructors. She would do series on one side, but not on the other side. I have to correct her routines as I go, otherwise my sciatica goes into full swing after aerobics.Still, it is a great compressed workout and I would recommend it to others."
2,RIP OFF!,"What a RIP OFF! I read about the product description and was amazed to find a STONE URN, GRANITE , which weighs 15.2 pounds. And at a great price. It is completely false statement and description. The urns are made of plastic, which bends in many places, weighs one pound, and is not granite, but barely granite looking.The seller MUST change the description, to save other customers from being lead into thinking it is a heavy weight , stone , granite urn. It should clearly mention the material is plastic, and weight is no more than a pound. If I knew that it is going to turn out a light weight plastic, I would never have thought of buying it."
5,A sobering study of human response to the unexplained.,"The northern lights show up much farther South than usual, so far South in fact, that no one recognizes them as northern lights. With that brilliance in the night sky, it must be that the world is coming to an end. The panic and the reactions of the characters are every bit as intriguing as those of the passengers of the Titanic. I cannot believe that no one else has come forward to review this Kentucky classic by one of this century's greatest Agrarian writers."
2,VDO C Series D Wireless Cadence Kit - I hope it keeps working!,"I installed the VDO C Series D Wireless cadence kit on my recumbent bike about two months ago. As very few accessories are designed with recumbents in mind, the installation was challenging. However, I was able to install the magnet and sensor so that it worked--until about two weeks ago. I have not had time to figure out how (or even if) I can get it working again--time is precious and it is frustrating when things do not work as they are intended. If I cannot get it working again, I will be extremely disappointed as well as disgruntled that I paid for this inoperative device because cadence monitoring is quite important for my attempting to keep a relatively high spinning cadence on the recumbent bicycle."
1,It does not work,After charging this device for over 24 hours I set it up to charge my cellphone but ran out of juice (without charging the phone) in less than a minute! It obviosly does not hold a charge.
4,"Rebuild the CV axle yourself, save $300-400","If you have a torn boot, then this is an acceptable replacement, comes with clamps n grease. The neoprene rubber of this boot is of okay quality, a bit thin, but it will do the job. Make sure you get this for the outer side of your axle as the inner side needs a hi temp. silicone boot.Update; If you spring for these boots, it better be because you cannot find OEM ones. 99% of the time, OEM is better because they use thermoplastic, and probably cost about $10 more. These are acceptable replacements if you know what your doing as they won't hold up to too much grease or any other mistake you might make."
2,not universal,"The description of ""universal fit"" is misleading. It was much too big for my Hyundai Accent. Plus hard to install. Better off to buy entire shaft assembly."
2,Flop not flip,"Item color was interesting, leather case of good construction however the clip borke on the first day. Ended up using as a carry case, did not like the neck strap."
1,Only ONE Good Thing About It!,"I bought this camera for a very special occassion. I needed a camera for a very special trip I was taking with my daughter.First, there isn't an memory card that would fit into it without SHOVING it in! I did get good photos. Too bad the camera DELETED them while I watched, not even TOUCHING anything! I had a good return policy, which is the ONLY good thing about this piece of JUNK!!!"
3,Classic Creature Movies 2 - Snowbeast,Good to get bonus of 2 extra movies. Snowbeast was a movie been wanting to see since a kid and it did not disappoint. Not for everyone - a bit cheesy but enjoyable. Creature like an early type alien movie. OK.
5,AWESOME!!!!!,I had to write this when I saw the other review. It is absolutely beyond me how anyone could listen to MariAnne Häggander and not find her voice beautiful. This is one of my favorite CDs!!!
5,A great video,"I bought this video after reading the reviews here. It is a great workout. It's perfect for beginners, because she doesn't do a lot of reps (but they are effective!). I was sore the next day. It gives a good, complete workout in 30 minutes. Their outfits are really tacky, but I can look beyond that. As long as I'm getting in a good workout, it doesn't really matter what their wearing. I'm keeping this one."
4,my first,"this would be the first video i did all the way thru. it kinda reminds me of my old gym class warm ups. hard to do at first but you get the hang of it(reminder: i haven't done this kinda stuff in over 2 years). tho i wish they had more streching, so do your own before hand. i like how its simple. no goofy moves. hehe i had to laugh at the vid the first time i reviewed it, hey its fromm 1988 i can't help but make fun of the 80's :). music is not annoying.i give it 4 stars mainly cause of lack of streching. im used to alot of streching from dancing school and gym class."
4,good workout,This is a nice video that is not too long. It focuses on all parts of the body so you get a nice overall workout and its fun to do. The music and the setting are nice.
5,"excellent gets to the point, no floating in the air","this is an excellent video I have had mine for 6 years you will feel it the first time you use it. The instructor really takes care of you warming you up, working you hard, then cooling you down and releasing each move. I especially like it because these are real exercises with no crazy twists or movements that are humanly impossible. targets the hips thighs and buttocks .the whole tonetics series is excellent! The first time you do it you will see sculpting! Don't let the simplicity fool you you may have to work up to doing all the reps!"
5,I love this video,This is the only excercise video that works for me. It targets everything without the fast-pace.
2,I Miss Larry Brown,"I need to vent! After reading the posted reviews of this book I took a chance on it thinking it might be just a tad bit similar to Larry Brown's writings - NOT!. First, this book is very, very thin. Not worth it's price. Secondly, whomever edited this book did a ""not so good job"" of including works that may have showcased Crews' writings. Lastly, I'm disappointed that Larry Brown is dead and that Harry Crews just doesn't fit the bill for me as a southern writer."
3,Not bad,"I bought this as a replacement for similar book I thought I had lost (The Constitution of the United States with the Declaration of Independence and the Articles of Confederation, by R.B. Bernstein). I couldn't find the Bernstein book on Amazon, so I picked this one instead.Pros: this one is smaller, so will fit in a pocket easier; contains Jefferson's ""A Bill for Establishing Religious Freedom""Cons: missing any kind of footnotes for the amendments citing what previous article or amendment in the Constitution was modified, if any.For the price, this one is well worth the money. Oh, and I subsequently found my copy by R.B. Bernstein, so now I think I've got the best of both."
1,BEWARE LIBITARIANS AND CONSERVATIVES,"The low rating is not for the documents within this volume; it is for the persons name that is attached to this volume that I object to. The name is Cass Sunstein; a Progressive who believes that the Constitution is a living document and not static; as our founders intended. He is also someone who believes that the Constitution contains within it, a separation of church and state clause; for which it does not. He is everything that stands against our country and our founders. The documents here in are essential reading for all Americans, for these documents are ours, not the governments. I cannot, in good conscience, pick up this book without feeling a heavy weight and a foul air."
2,Overloaded Level,"The other review of this recording is spot on as far as the material and performance goes. However, while most of the recording is very excellent, with a very wide (and realistic) dynamic range, and exceedingly good overall sound, the climaxes are seriously, indeed very seriously, and audibly, overloaded. There is probably 6 dB of clipping in the very last two seconds.Caveat emptor but only if you are sensitive to this problem."
1,Sizing is way off,"The product states that this should fit a child 44-48 inches tall. It will not fit a child this tall. The top will not come up high enough to cover the chest area. However, the next size up is much bigger, and if your child is slim it will be very loose."
4,very nice costume,"This is the right costume if you want the full-on Wonder Woman pretend experience for your child. Small is about right for ages 5-7. Of course, it's basically a bikini with accessories, but that's the way the character's written. I try to get my daughter to put the costume on over leggings. The ""silver"" bracelets and golden lasso work fine."
3,WAAAY to big!,The costume itself is great. Higher quality than I expected BUT (and this is a BIG but!) The sizing is horrible! I found this to be the case for another costume from this manufacturer as well. Buy at least a size smaller!
4,Wonder Girl Love,"I purchased this costume for my 3 1/2 yr old daughter, she's very tall for her age (size 6 in normal kids clothing) and size medium fits well (she still has a little room to grow into but it's fine for now). The small size would have been too tight. Let me just tell you that ""SHE LOVES her wonder woman outfit"" and basically wears it playing around for several hours during the day. It's that comfortable! Which is a big plus because she hates any itchy fabric and this one is great! She loves to pretend play and is very imaginative. Also the lasso is well made and has withstood all the abuse so far. The boot covers are another story she won't even wear those, they are a little awkard to wear without shoes, if you're just playing indoors. That is the only reason I didn't give this a 5 star. Overall I'm very satisfied with this purchase and it arrived pretty fast too!"
3,"Fun costume, boots don't stay up.","My 6 year old daughter loves this costume! However, the boot covers don't stay up. It's so frustrating to always have to adjust them. Halloween is days away and I still haven't found a good solution that won't interfere with the rest of the costume."
3,beware of the size chart,SOme of the other reivews warned that the size the company advertize runs samll and they were right. I even took that into conisderation when I ordered the cosutme for my child and it is still WAY too small. The small (supposedly size 4-6 is really for a two year old. THe boots are super tall but not wide enough go around my childs legs. The cape fits but the head band does not. It seems very mismatched. On the up side. My daughter love sit and didnt wantto takeit off. Just make sure that i you want a msall really order a large and then you can work with the material to adjust downward. Also the company does not accept returns so I could NOT exchange it for a larger size.
4,Lee's best solo album and a showcase for drummer Steve Gadd!,"This is clearly Lee's best electric guitar solo album. Even though not all songs are splendid, the first two are a sizzling start of this album. This is also mainly due to the AMAZING DRUMMING of Steve Gadd. He has played on so many recordings of so many artists, but this is his finest hour. So if you are a drumming enthousiast, check this album out!"
3,Biology and ecology of Cultured Species,"My name Ahmed Nfati,I,m student in university of Malta at Biology Department."
3,A book for high school kids,"I bought this book hoping for a serious advice for a professional portfolio creating, but found a bunch of recommendations good for high school-freshmen on how to best present their non-professional expereinces... How a real professional's portfolio looks like - is still a question for me... It seems like a portflio created following these guidelines would make a seasoned professional, an employer, smile at ""the kid's nice attempt""."
1,Creating Your Career Portfolio,"This is at best a good civic lesson for a grade school, freshman in High School class text. No real employer would ever find this portfolio professional or useful. It presents a lot of hype, fluff, and encourages the reader to overstate and exagerate his skills."
1,Don't They Teach People How to Write Scripts These Days?,"I bought this DVD just because of the big stars in it. I am quite surprised that the great setting, the breathtakingly beautiful woods, is not used to the fullest. It's merely a backdrop rather than a solid background of the movie.The scripts, and of course the dialogs, are plain awful. I don't know why those big stars even bother to be in it in the first place.The DVD has no extra features, except for 3 trailers (including the movie's own trailer). The movie is presented in full screen format. What a waste!"
3,Too expensive compared to others in it's class,"I love the iPaq, but the battery life is really awful compared to everyone elses. I was amazed to learn that some people can have their units on stand buy for weeks, I can't have my iPaq on stand by for days. 2 or 3 days will completely [drain] the battery and cause you to have to restore all your programs and everything. It's slower than others in it's class and it had more memory. The screen is bright and easy to see and the finger print scanner is nice. I don't understand how others have both SD and CF card slots when this unit is actually larger and only has an SD slot. It' a nice unit, just way to [costly] for what you get."
5,Great PDA but after the third ROM Upgrade,It is a great PDA after three rom upgrades.. and wlan upgrade.. my 5455 is a very complete PDA.. compatible with 802.11b / g wireless network.. excellent bluetooth connectivity wizard.. and the fingerprint great :) the screen and the backlight wonderful!!And i am waiting for windows mobile 2003 upgrade for a much better performance :):):)
3,Not bad... but not knocked out,"On the plus side, I think that the screen quality is phenomenal and the handwriting recognition is quite good. However, there are a number of annoying quirks in my IPAQ that diminish its utility. For one, I find myself soft booting the machine far too often; either the programs hang or I have problems switching from my wireless network at home to the one at work. Perhaps the former is more a problem with Windows Pocket PC than the hardware, but nevertheless, it's annoying. I also have to agree with one reviewer who found it odd that you cannot sync over the wireless 802.1x network (I don't know if this is possible over Bluetooth; I haven't tried it). I don't think that the IPAQ is worth it's list price unless you are an avid e-mailer with constant connection to a wireless network, but it's probably a good buy if you can find it used."
3,Beautiful but Buggy,"It's been two months and everything worked fine until last week. Then I had to start angling the AC charger into the receptor at a very precise angle. The next day I had to prop it to an even more extreme angle to connect. Soon the unit wouldn't Active Sync and, today, nothing is connecting. I rang HP who said they'd send a padded mailer and have it back to me within four working days. We shall see. I'll keep you informed...."
3,temperamental,"The 5455 has character. All features work fine after taking it apart and removing the vibrator module. Finally, after having the untit in storage for 6 months I am able to synchronise again. All those guys who are not happy with the HP IPAQ. I need the upgrade to 2003 from 2002. Any help is appreciated as to where I can get a free download. Microsoft should allow a free download after all the trouble with the unit by so many people all over the world.cheersab"
3,Excellent features but the battery died after 4 months,"The HP iPAQ 5455 Pocket PC has some very good features as you would have seen in other reviews but the 2 things I did not like about it are:(1) I never got the biometric reader to work.(2) The battery died after 4 months of use, it did not even switch on when I installed the expansion pack (which was an additional expense)The bottom line: buy a cheaper model without the biometric reader and save some money."
1,Not good,"I got the HP5455 2 months ago. The battery life is horrible, interface is awkward, and form-factor too large.... After dealing with the thing for 2 months, I've spent another $500 to replace it with a new palm (which I love). Stay away from the HP5455."
1,Terrible,"This has to be the worst movie I ever bought. I only wanted it to add to my Caroline Munro set, I don't believe it was even worth the $1.11 I spent."
2,Globalism & the loss of US soverignty,"Soros outlines just how to take down capitalist America. Here's an excerpt: ""The main obstacle to a stable and just world order is the United States"" He announced in 2003 that it is necessary to ""puncture the bubble of American supremacy."" Soros is working systematically to achieve that goal."
2,not a first impression,"I used to think this guy was a bit off but seemed to be a trend setter. After I read his book, now I know he is definitely strange. Won't recommend it to give him a platform. But is a read to compare views."
1,worth the read..but you can dumb the book,"one has to go into the hearts of darkness to realize the darkness..a book which diverge everyone's attention on the American moral ground is constructed and should be led by our government officials which are total bullshit..he is the crook of the century collaborating and affiliating with Rothschild legacy and empire..he who controls the bank controls the countries..to be fooled by the ""abnormly"" or ""normalcy"" of what one sees.."
3,yet another hopeless philosopher,"After reading Mr. Soros's book, which is not an easy task, I believe he had to deal with his conscience. It must be extremely difficult for a forteen year old Jewish boy escaping Hitler's racial vilification and death sentence, by false identity-papers.The freedom of post-war England and USA made him able to enjoy the limitless fruits of capitalism, no matter how he gained his wealth.There is no doubt he is an intelligent, introspective man with good intentions, but he can't give us a solution, he can't use his money to prevent another Hitler, another war.What a dilemma. Can he give us a better book next time?"
1,A Waste Of Time and Money!,"Don't waste your time an money on this diatribe against the United States and our President. George Soros is at best a weak Socialist, and most probably is a true Communist - except that he has what he wants (money) and now he going to tell the rest of us how terrible our country is, and how we should live. I am sorry I contributed to his tainted wealth by buying this book."
3,HUGE- covers part of eyes,"These masks covered the lower inside area of my eyes, which made my eyes kind of burn and made it extremely difficult to see, especially since I wanted to use them for cleaning (so I would have to look down slightly). There was no way to move them around and make them stay below my eyes. I ended up wearing goggles to push them down and later just holding them with one hand and cleaning with the other.My face is relatively small and these seem sized for a man so that was part of the problem. But, even on the picture you can see that the mask goes right up along the guy's eyes.They did seem to block some of the smell of the chemicals I was using, though the smell does come in around the sides. Also, it got super sweaty under the mask."
5,Why aren't there more?!,"I was never so sorry to have a series come to an end! These characters wrap themselves around you and draw you into their wonderful world...a world filled with love of family, food, drink and all that life offers. Pop Larkin is one of the most charming and lovable characters ever written and Ma Larkin is a joy! The children, friends and neighbors are all so delightful and the story lines are funny and warm. I rented it first and then bought the series because I knew it was something I was going to want to go back to every now and then just for the sheer pleasure of it."
5,"Romance, Time Travel, love at every turn","I couldn't put it down!!! It takes you through the trials and tribulations of love and loss as you follow the characters through their time transcendence love affair. It's a great first novel by Baldwin, can't wait to see more of her work!"
5,A truly amazing sound,"I stumbled across this CD and was completely blown away by the sound. Imagine peppy (danceable?) modern jazz with a Japanese feel. Keyboard, piano, drums, acoustic guitar, and many others mix with Agatsuma's shamisen and its distinctive 'slap' sound and create a delicious cocktail of music that is refreshing and cool. If you are a fan of world music (as I am) and modern jazz (ditto), you are guaranteed to enjoy this CD."
2,"NOT ""The Mysterious Stranger""","Viewers and Twain fans should be warned that this is NOT based on the well known Twain story, but based on a previously unpublished manuscript for a completely different story sharing a few plot elements and the title. Twain's literary executor, Albert Bigelow Paine, chose a previously written version to edit and publish as ""The Mysterious Stranger"" after Twain's death. Though Paine's editing was controversial, his decision as to which was the better story was certainly correct. The dark satire and human insight present in the better known version are completely missing here and replaced by warmed over ""Connecticut Yankee"" style adventures. The film's producers claim this version is the version Twain intended to publish based primarily on chronology, though the author left all versions unfinished when he died.Pleasant enough as family fare, a rather bland story -- particularly in the shadow of the other ""The Mysterious Stranger."""
4,Good Start,"This book certainly deserves credit for laying down simple yet tangible steps to becoming a successful real estate investor.However, I felt I was left ""hanging"" at the end of several chapters. Before I knew it, I was at the ""Managing and Selling Your Properties"" thinking ""Whoa, what happened to the actual researching and buying process?"" I know for myself, locating and buying my first home was the longest, most difficult, and most emotional process I have been through in a long time.I got a sense that the authors were more interested in getting you motivated and then to contact them to get setup with a mentor. Which is great. I just felt there should have been a few more details. A slight disappointment given the size of the book.Anyway, I do recommend the book. Just don't get your hopes up that this is the first and last guide you will buy for your real estate investing career."
3,Info???,"Ignore the rating. I had a question and there' s nowhere to post one so I had to use the review thing (take note, Amazon.. jeez). You have no info on these wings. What are the measurements?"
1,Proved to be Useless,"This ""guide"" really proved to be useless. The only sight we needed it for (everything else is within walking distance of the city center) was to get to Nymphenburg. But the instructions were so obscure that we got better info from the U-bahn travel center. Save your money."
1,Just Somebody,You have to work with the camera to get a good picture. If there is any movement by the subject the picture is very poor. It has 2.0 megapixel but you still have to spend more money to get a quality lens and so forth. Megapixels are not the all in all for digital cameras.
5,Super,"This camera is the best i've ever seen for the prize. Its got every thing that a casual user would need. The pictures are good, and you can expand the memory with SD/MMc cards and it has a decent colour LCD."
5,Nice Digital Camera,"I have one and l like the way it take pictures, the way you canview them after you take them. I like the most is the way itwork with my Mac G3 computer. Nothing to it."
5,Finally released and not a bootleg.,"This one is finally out in a non bootleg form,the music and throbbing score when the priest emerges masked from behind the curtain to torture is amazing,creepiest music and a pounding disco bass makes the scenes worth the price of admission.The ending is terrible and ruins the film,but the last victim tortured does a strange innocent naked little dance for the killer and he asks her to leave this place quickly.She repels his wish and says ""You've paid good money for me,lets get it on"" Totally insane movie,only could have been made in the satanic seventies,captures the spirit of 1977 and 1978 when life was a surreal endless party,unfortunatly it ended and were stuck in a fabricated unfun controlled world now."
2,Awful even for a schlockmeister like myself,"I applaud Code Red DVD for releasing this kind of movie and adding a horror host to present them. I have no regrets buying it, but jeez, this movie is not very good at all. The same kill scenes are repeated, the direction of the movie is horribly inept, and it frankly hurts to watch it. It's not a fun cheesy movie, it plain stinks. ""Night of the Demon"" is much better, but that's like saying getting punched in the nuts is a little better than getting kicked in the nuts. It all depends on your threshold for bad movies, and Mardis Gras Massacre tests it.I enjoy ""Blood Feast,"" ""Gore Gore Girls,"" and movies like that, but this doesn't belong in that category. It's not so bad it's funny, it's so bad it's, well, bad.Keep releasing these movies, though, Code Red, because I love collecting these strange pieces of cinema."
3,Unusual horror movie,A psycho sacrifices hookers to his god on an altar. Picture quality leaves a lot to be desired but the plot is ok. If you like old drive in horror movies you might like this.
1,This Was A Really Terrible Movie!,"This movie titled 'Mardis Gras Massacre' had to be one of the worst movies that I have ever had to sit through. I live very close to the city of New Orleans and I am from the state of Louisiana also. When I was in Jr. High School and High School I was in the High School band and we went to New Orleans every year for many days in order to march in the parades so it is not like I have never been to Mardis Gras. This movie had to be as far from being real as anything could ever get. I really could not believe how fake most of the murder scenes actually looked. This was an absolute waste of both time and money, No Doubt!!!"
5,For fans of 70s Grindhouse cinema.,"I'm a huge fan of 1970s grindhouse films, so this movie is among my favorites. It has a great soundtrack when the killer sacrifices his victims, and the entire movie has a big 70s type feel to it. The gore scenes when the women are sacrificed on the alter are very graphic, even though the effects are very low budget. An interview on the disc reveals that they used cow hearts for the scenes; stuff like this is typical of grindhouse films. There's also a lot of nudity, a funny scene with a rhyming pimp, and real scenes of Mardi Gras during the 70s. Whether or not you consider it a slow film is going to depend on your taste for 70s films; I personally thought it moved pretty fast, even though it doesn't have a huge body count. The bottom line is that this film isn't for everyone. If you watch mainly mainstream horror you might not like it; but if you like horror films from the 70s and some films from Joe D' Amato, you might enjoy it."
3,ok...,the instructor is a bit annoying. the video is pretty boring to watch. i know it's not about watching but i do like when they at least have a pretty background or setting. the video looks just like the cover. white.
1,Check for damage,As I had read in other reviews of similar bits from Freud. The bits arrived loose from packaging and the carbide cutter on one was chipped badly.Update. Received my replacements from Amazon and they picked up the cost of shipping each direction. The bits arrived in good condition and did a good job.
4,Studio Ghibi does it again,"I've watched other Studio Ghibi films (starting with ""Princess Monoke"") and since this was made by Studio Ghibi, I picked it up. I haven't watched ""Grave of the Fireflies"" as yet, but am planning to get it. Which may be a better film than Pom Poko.Pom Poko is about magical creatures that can transform into humans (or statues). The creatures' Tama Hills are being destroyed by Man, and the creatures go to war. 3 Humans die in the movie, but the creatures do pray for them...killing humans weren't a part of thier plan.I was surprised that Disney released a film that had inflatable testicles in it. It shocked me the first time I saw it, but I soon forgot it. In the English dub, they are called ""pouces"".This is one of the better Ghibi films. And I do agree that it's not for young children."
3,Probably my least fave Studio Ghibli film.,"And it's still good! It moives at too slow a pace though, and it actually gets kind of boring in spots. The chanting and singing the raccoons do get on my nerves. The scene where they go into town and put on that sort of fireworks/illusion show for the humans was cool, but that's about it. I like the meaning behind the movie (humans are destroying nature, nature tries defending itself), but it fails to captivate me like a majority of the other Ghibli movies do."
4,Preview before showing to your pre-teen kids,"Heh. I just previewed this movie before showing to my 5 1/2 year old daughter and am glad I did. I'd rather not get into explanations about scrotums, raccoon humping, and other various topics.This is a great movie for tweens and older, but I'd rather skip the drama for those under 7 years old. YMMV.Amusing to watch the English/Disney audio simultaneously with the English (presumably from Ghibli) subtitles. There is quite a difference, including the beautiful song about raccoon testicles (at 45:52 ""The baby raccoon sees our balls and swings his, too)."
4,Tree-hugger movie,"Not action packed, but lots of fun with a ""tree hugger"" nature-saver theme.A bunch of raccoons are getting squeezed out of their habitat by development. Raccoons are one of the animals that can change shape and using that talent, they try to scare the humans away, but ultimately fail to progress. Finally using their talents to adapt to their new environment."
1,Not for young children,"I rented this movie for my 6 year old daughter because it had the Disney label and pictures of cute raccoons on the front. I shut it off at the beginning of the first battle scene. If the prominent scrotums (mentioned in another review) weren't bad enough, the raccoons transformed into Ninja/Sumo/Samurai warriors and committed mayhem and violence against each other. This movie would probably appeal to pre-teen boys, but is not appropriate for yongre kids. Why is Disney squandering their good name on junk like this???"
4,One for heavy horse and australian bush history lovers,"This was a facinating look at era that is part of Australian History. The movie captured the period very well, giving the viewer a glimpse of what life really must have been like in the bush post 1st world war. The opening scenes of a twenty horse team pulling a waggon are wonderful and something that we may never see again in Australia, and an absolute must see for heavy horse lovers."
5,The Anchor Bible Dictionary (6 Volume Set),"The books were in excellent shape and they were shipped and received almost immediately. I have used the books on numerous occassions and decided to purchase a set for my personal library. This is without a doubt a must for every pastor's library. The shipping was immediate and the books were wrapped individually and packed carefully as to avoid damage. Thanks, Charles"
1,DOES NOT WORK AND DOES NOT FIT,This does not fit properly they have the wrong plug attached to the cable. SO it does not work with the unit. Its too cheap to return. This was a waste of money.
4,Great Entertainment with lots of action,"This is a great show, suitable for adults, as well as children. It is a show from a period in which people thought (correctly, I believe!) that there is no problem we cannot solve, using logic, and science.It brought back a lot of memories about when the world was looking forward to the future, and people were more positive, and constructive about things.A lot of work went into all the episodes. The models and sets were fantastic; very detailed, and realistic. The scripts were also very well written. This is considered a classic show by many. I recommend buying it, and discovering it for yourself."
3,Another summary of articles put together,"Duffie and Singleton are the masters of the reduced-form credit risk modeling approach. Although well-written, their book does not add anything new. It's just another review of the state of the art in credit risk. One can get the original papers and learn much more without having to read a short summary on each work. You will not be able to learn how to model a credit risky instrument by reading this book.I would have liked to see fewer references and more worked-out examples with derivations and detailed numerical applications."
2,Poor writers,"The book covers all the relevant topics and provides a slightly different presentation of their own models. However, the book glosses over the mathematics and is written in a very stiff style. The authors have never been known as good writers but in this case they are not presenting anything new. Rather disappointing from two rather strong academics."
3,Humayun Ali,"Although well-written, their book does not add anything new. It's just another review of the state of the art in credit risk. One can get the original papers and learn much more without having to read a short summary on each work. You will not be able to learn how to model a credit risky instrument by reading this book.I would have liked to see fewer references and more worked-out examples with derivations and detailed numerical applications."
3,Sanford strikes again,"This is the 4th book in the Kidd series and like the others it's a quick read and hard to put down.While in Louisiana doing a painting for some rich guy, Kidd discovers that Bobby, the leader of the hacker ring he's a member of, has been murdered. Suddenly news stories about corrupt senators and of experiments gone wrong by the US government start showing up on the news. Kidd and company suspect that this has something to do with Bobby's missing laptop. They begin to investigate and find out just how much Bobby knew. Unfortunatly the information is in the wrong hands and they need to get it back.This book is a quick read, but in a few places there's just to much going on and should be cut out of it. In other words I glazed over it to get back to the story. Other than these areas its a great read for anyone following this series of books."
3,Too Many Weather Reports,"I am a John Sandford fan, and this is the first in the Kidd series I've read. I prefer the Prey series, which is written in a tighter, edgier style. This story seemed to drag for me. Kidd, a professional hacker, and his (?) girlfriend LuEllen, a professional burglar, keep trying to chase Carp, a man who killed the master hacker, Bobby. Their chases are bungling and nonsensical. Sandford throws in a weather report everywhere, it seems, and sometimes I wondered if that just wasn't filler to make the book longer. I like the Lucas Davenport character, did not particularly like Kidd. And I don't know why. Maybe I'm just used to a better style of writing, which Sandford incorporates with the Prey series."
4,Hacking 101,"This is my first John Sandford book, and even though it is the fourth installment of the Kidd series, it can be read as a separate novel, and I was able to follow along without any trouble.These are the adventures of Kidd, a computer genius/super hacker/criminal mastermind who happens to paint as a sideline, and his on and off girlfriend LuEllen, a cat burglar. I have no idea if the computer stuff is accurate, and if it is, it's certainly scary that people can track you with every step you make, but it makes for good reading anyway.The murder of a secretive uber-hacker named Bobby causes a lot of problems for Kidd and co, and it becomes a matter of life and death for them to retrieve Bobby's laptop, which contains enough dirt to bring down many major politicians, as well as Kidd, LuEllen and many more in the network.Fast paced, vividly detailed and extremely plausible, at least to non-techies, it makes for a quick and thoroughly entertaining read.Amanda Richards, August 8, 2005"
5,Kidd's Online Friend.. Dead...,"Kidd isn't exactly a hero. He's a thief and an outlaw... but he doesn't consider himself as such. Still, his computer hacking and thief skills puts him in the position of the most powerful person in the United States... the person with the data so powerful he could blackmail or control the person in power...It is exactly what he does. He recovers the computer with the informaation overload so deadly to so many people. He shows it's power when his longtime friend and lover Luann is caught. He uses it when everything goes wrong as well.Kidd isn't a hero, but he isn't an anti-hero either. He is out for himself in a world of corruption and greed, with himself as either the victim or the guy who profits from the greed of others."
3,"Hackers, Whackers, What?","This is a very slow moving story, in which criminals (hacker Kidd and his burglar friend LuEllen) are trying to catch another criminal and fail lousy. The other gangsters in the story are politicians; this part is somewhat in sync with Fahrenheit 9/11 with the only contrast that one is a documentary and this one is fiction. I was trying to be entertained by this book, but fell asleep over and over again. The story is very nerve soothing. In case you need a tranquilizer read this book!"
4,"More Kidd novels, please","I picked up this book to read at the airport, and didn't have high expectations for it. Now I'm eagerly tracking down and reading all of Sandford's Kidd novels.Sandford has a clean, uncluttered writing style and his roguish characters are highly appealing. The geographical details are just right, and the technological story elements ring true. I'm amazed that there haven't been any Kidd movies yet!"
2,A Disappointing Read!,"I have read all of John Sandford's novels and I especially enjoyed the Kidd Novels because of the excitment of how these crooks used there skills and how exciting Sandford would write about their illegal exploits. I also like the way that Sandford breaks away and shows the reader what is going through the mind of the ""Bad Guys"". This did not happen in this book. We know about the bad guy in chatper one and then we are never left alone with him to to see how his mind is turning. Kidd and LuEllen don't do anything exciting for the first 3/4 of the book. Lets hope that the next Kidd novel will bring back some of the excitment that this one was lacking."
1,Hanged mans song,Very poor. To much detail with too many players. Very hard to keep up to the author as he skipped all over the place. I have read all of sander sons books except the Kidd series. This was the worst
3,In your face,"John Sandford is a very talented writer. I enjoy his Davenport novels as much as I do Robert Parker's Spencer books. My rating is more focused on the subject than on John Sandfords excellent abilities. The plot and action is worth your time. However, I'm not too overjoyed by control geeks undercover ops attempting to take over the world."
3,Shoulda been a 5 BUT...,"I just finished reading this and I'm not sure how I feel about it. This was my first John Sandford/Kidd book but it probably won't be my last. The characters were interesting, the plot was good and solid, the ending felt plausible and all in all, it was a good, fast read. Now, for the major negative, the language. I don't know why I'm being so critical and sensitive about this all of a sudden but I am. The use of the particular 4-letter ""F"" word was way too frequent. If you are sensitive about this situation, don't read this book. For me, this turned a really good (almost great) book into a mediocre one. Maybe soon, I'll get over my distaste of the word and just skip over it, and enjoy Sandford, Leonard, DeMille etc. It's a shame that one word would change a book from a 5 star into a 3, but that's the way I feel at the moment. Thanks for listening!"
5,A Good Quick Read - Page Turner!,"I picked up this book after I read the Devils Code (which by the way is very poorly written). I was pleasantly surprised not only at the way the story moved but also the pace.It was a quick read and towards the ending I couldn't let go of the book at all. A good plot, some good twists and an excellent ending. If you enjoyed any of the ""Kidd"" character books, this will definitely make you happy :)"
3,Not exactly a techno-thriller...,"...but entertaining enough. I listened to HMS on the daily commute. If, as Publishers Weekly reports, ""The early entries in this series have aged badly because of the advances in technology,"" that's all I need to read to know that I won't be exploring earlier entries in the ""Kidd"" series. HMS hardly fictionalizes technology at the cutting edge. As techno-capers go, it's pretty lame. But the story is decently paced, and its characters sufficiently well drawn (for a book of the genre). Score HMS an OK distraction, nothing more."
2,Poor,"Another book bought only for book club purposes.This one though felt like I was picking up the book from the middle of the story, even in the first few pages. There seemed to be some continuity issues for me, and I wonder if that is because this is my first (and last) Kidd novel. I found it lack- luster and difficult to get through. Regret having to buy and read this one so much."
5,Enjoyed the book,I have read most of John Sandford books. All of them have been great and this one is no exception. i really enjoy the murder mystery series and he is a master of storytelling.
2,Not Sanford's Best,"Unlike most of his stuff, this one dragged. The whole story line was rather convoluted and I couldn't decide whether or not to finish it."
5,"ITS ABSOLUTELY ""DARLINGS""","I saw this series while living in London in 1991 when it was first aired. It is absolutely charming - well written, superbly set and the performances are divine. David Jason made a brilliant leap of talent in moving from his portrayal of the cynical Inspector Frost in the detective series ""A Touch of Frost"" to the lovable Pop Larkin. If your entertainment palate has become jaded by the drivel and tripe dished up by American sitcoms, give The Darling Buds of May a taste ... you will enjoy it enormously."
2,so so,"it was ok. lots of repeat footage from his other movies, but there is a good amount of pre-""famous"" steve-o. if your a die hard steve-o fan, yeah, you can buy this, but if not, save the cash."
5,Good but..,It has one problem.product image has Special Edition cover image.but real product has original cover image.
4,Another Colombian superstar!,"What's is up with Colombian singers these days? They are producing the BEST Spanish language rock/pop music in the last few years! Just take a look at Los Aterciopelados, Shakira, and Soraya, to name a few. And each has his/her own distinct style, there is no 'Colombian' sounds.Anyway, Juanes has produced an outstanding album, with great music and intellectual lyrics. Not bad for a first album. I love the song 'Para Ser Eterno', but my favorite by far is 'Fijate Bien'; the rest are just as good, but those two are playing over and over in my CD player. Those three Grammy awards were well deserved.If anyone wants to venture into Latin pop-rock, this is a good place to start."
5,I can't decide which is my favorite,Let me start by saying that I have both albums and I have a hard time deciding which is my favorite. I love them both I love the folklore of the music and the truth but sad reality of which some songs speak of. I am amazed by the honesty and spirituality and maturity about life that Juanes transmits in his songs. Some speak of love others of the crude reality of the world that we live in but it offers hope as well. It does not matter if you are Colombian or not anybody can indentify whith what the songs are relating to the listener. I hope that God blesses Juanes with more songs so we can enjoy them.
1,Don't believe the hype !,"Apparently this CD was nominated for several awards, possibly as a result of manipulation from the Music Company. The bottom line is that most songs sound the same and the lyrics are simplistic."
1,Una gran desilusion !,"Todas las canciones suenan parecido, una voz con muy pocas opciones, letras muy poco elaboradas (como poemas de estudiante de High School). Quizas la el unico tema rescatable es ""Me da igual""."
1,"it sounds right, but it aint right","This is the kind of music that has ""crossover"" appeal. Nothing wrong with that but what you get is rock en español without borders, without nationalism, without race, without conflict, without gender, without prejudice, without hatred...it's everything and nothing at all. It's the kind of music that Emilio and Gloria Estefan would rock to. Enough said."
5,Loved it!!!,"Juanes es uno de los mejores en Latino America... yo no soy fanatica de el rock en Espanol... sin embargo, cuando escuche la cancion Fijate Bien, me encanto!!! La musica de Juanes es diferente... y la letra de sus canciones excelente!!!"
4,Juanes.. How can you not like it?,"An early work, not as well orchestrated as Juanes unplugged.. but still very good.Juanes is a poet and a singer."
5,Great CD,"Here is what I have to say about ""Fijate Bien"", I love it to death. Seriously, it is one of best CD's I own, without the exception of Shakira, and Mana CDs. I don't know about you, but my fave song is ""Fijate Bien"". I went through a lot of mess-ups to get this CD and now I know it was completely worth it.Viva Juanes!"
4,More great action from the Kung Fu master,"Young Bruce, a collage student, want's to perfect his fighting skills to defend himself against the Kung Fu street thugs in Hong Kong. Seeking revenge for his murdered friend, Bruce learns the deadly Snake Fist Style of Kung Fu. This move contains some of Bruce's best fighting."
5,Enjoyable light football themed card game.,"This is primarily a card management game with the theme of football that features some really nice components. It isn't complicated, nor does it require a thorough knowledge of football to play. Easy to get the hang of play in a few minutes and it takes less than an hour to play out a complete basic game. It also has individual player/team chips for advanced play so fans of football board games can play out make-believe seasons and even establish leagues if so desired.Even non-football fans might enjoy playing this."
2,Kung-poo,For the first half hour you are lost along with the movie trying to find your way to the eject button. The movie's story does improve later but the video game/style weapons and fighting tactics along with the terrible acting on all sides makes it difficult to sit through. This is not artistic film making in any way. It is a series cliche scenes strung along that slowly devours your brain. I would like to get my money back but I'm more concerned about the time I lost watching this film.
1,Don't Purchase This Movie!!,"DON'T PURCHASE THIS MOVIE!!I'm not sure where to start with my critique of this film but you can believe me that it was awful.I enjoy Chinese films because I like the action, hopefully appreciate the characters, and, if I'm lucky, find the plot entertaining. This movie was poorly written with a markedly unsuffisticated story line. The acting was so stoic that I couldn't even guess what the characters were thinking. The three major fight scenes were mediocre and predictable. A few colorful panoramic scenes didn't make this film any better.I'm fairly easy to please but this movie was a total bust. If you want my copy I'll give it to you but don't waste your two hours and thirty three minutes. RHT"
4,Classic,"I love these films. I watch them with subtitles so that I can get the emotional content of the true actors voices, eventhough I don't understand Mandarin. These films remind me of watching Kung-Fu Theather on Sundays as a child. Only the cinematography is leaps and bounds better."
2,This Dragon Dynasty BLU-RAY edition,"I hate giving bad reviews to a good film.I have the dvd and really enjoyed the movie, and went ahead with the purchase of this blu-ray edition. However, there is NO Cantonese spoken even thought it's labeled ""Cantonese/Mandarin"". Very disappointed."
1,"Video Quality is good, audio is crap!","I had the DVD version of this movie and like it alot, so I decided to buy the Bluray Version. How I am so disappointed that this Bluray Version didn't have the Cantonese Audio, even though it said Cantonese/Mandarin on the back. It's in Mandarin and then on top of that, I have it played on my 5.1 Surround sound and it sounded very crappy. There were pratically no bass and sounded so wierd. WTH? They really messed this one up. The video quality was decent."
3,You get what you pay for,"they work but if you look close at the picture you can see right by the handle grip there is an edge that looks like a seem. Well not looks like, it is a seem! I found out the hard way. The handle is separate from the rest of the piece so the only thing that holds the handle on to the speaker is the four screws directly on the handle. This works ok until you put a lot of pulling force and the handle pulls right off dropping your beloved speaker onto the pavement. No worries though just make sure to use a large head screw and even a washer so it won't stretch the four plastic holes. After the initial shock of dropping my pride and joy on the asphalt I remounted the handle with washers underneath my screws and haven't had any trouble."
3,Corman Triple Feature,"If you are a fan of Roger Corman or drive-in style campy horror, this is a great buy. All three films are scratchy, but they all deliver the needed laughs. Creature from the Haunted Sea is the most hilarious with its bug-eyed undersea monster. In his memoir, Corman says it was intentional that the Creature win in the end. Beast from Haunted Cave is not a Roger Corman film, but it's a good one from his brother Gene. Clearly making the most movie out of little money is a family tradition. The Wasp Woman is the most famous of these(surprisingly timely and relevant when one considers how often plastic surgery and radical diets make the news). You can't beat the price. I find it appropriate that you can get these movies without spending a fortune, since no one spent a fortune to make them!"
4,"none of these are oscar winners,but they have a style and they are just so much fun","roger corman was and always will be the ""king of the b movies"", and as his book said,he made over 200 movies in hollywood and never lost money on any of them,lets see other directors make that claim!!! what makes these movies,indeed,all of cormans movies so much fun is the fact that with little or no money he made movies that were fun to watch and fun to revisit time after time. you can sence that he was doing everything he could to make a movie that you would enjoy,and thats the charm of mr. corman,he wants you to have a good time,and if you think he didn't know that some of these movies were pure cheese then you don't get mr. corman or his movies,as most were made tounge in cheek anyway.settle back and watch these great cheese movies and have a ball."
2,"OK, Corman has been hailed as a genius, but.........","These movies were simply awful. OK, The Wasp Woman wasn't all THAT bad, but Creature from the Haunted Sea was literally one of the five worst movies I have ever seen, and Beast from Haunted Cave was one of the ten worst. But all in all I did not feel cheated, since I only paid $5.98, which is less than $2/movie. So buy it if you must, but don't expect to ""feel the magic"", because it just ain't there. Better off to put your money toward the Ed Wood Box or a copy of Robot Monster."
3,You Can Get This Free,If you go to Robert Force's website he has this book online *free* complete with example sound files.
3,It's good tea but it's just not for me!,I bought this tea because I never tried Turkish tea from the Black Sea before and I wanted to know what it tasted like. I purchased this particular brand because I enjoy apple juice so I thought they would make a good combination. Although the tea gave me the taste of the Turkish tea I was craving I did not care for the apple tastes at all. Therefore I will not buy this product again. I thought the product was a little on the expensive side as well.
4,turkish apple tea,The tea is good and a great reminder of our trip to Turkey. Will probably not buy again because of the high cost of shipping.
2,Didn't like it!!,"I had apple tea at a friend's house but made a mistake of not asking him what brand. Decided to order this one from Amazon based on the reviews and tried it. Every which way i made it, i hated it. Extremely sweet for my taste and hardly any apple flavor. The tea that i drank was dark and rich in color and tasted very pleasant without extreme sweetness while this one is extremely light in color and ridiculously sweetened with sugar and not very tasty."
4,Great,"I got this for my boyfriend, who has fond memories of Turkish Apple tea from his trip to Turkey years ago. I was hoping it would remind him of the tea, but was aware it may disappoint compared to the real thing. He absolutely loved it! I was so pleased."
1,Disappointing after live performance....................,"I heard this guy live at a slack key guitar concert. He was AMAZING! There, he performed only instrumentals. This CD is way different, and, in my opinion, a major disappointment! I hope he will produce another CD reminiscent of that live show. Until then, this one is BORING!"
5,"Clean cuts, tight fits. Poor packing.","This bit cuts smoothly and the joints fit perfectly. This is the quality that you expect from Freud.Amazon needs to package small, dense items like this much more securely. Although my bit was not damaged, it was placed loose in the box with no padding and easily could have been."
1,poor package,"I dont understand amazon people dont have, the right pacage for this bit, because the bid are bery destroyed."
5,Realistic water gardening,"With the boom in water garden popularity has come the boom in water gardening books. Most of these books are expensive and disappointing, either being pretty picture books or complicated guides to dream water gardens. As usual, the Brooklyn Botanic Garden 21st Century Gardening Series has delivered the goods for under $10. The subtitle of this book, ""Pools, Ponds, Marshes & Bogs for Backyards Everywhere,"" accurately describes this little jewel. Topics range from stream restoration to landscaping that soggy area in your yard. This tiny book also manages to pack in regional plant recommendations and an excellent resource list along with helpful and inspirational photographs. Buy it!"
3,"Works fairly well, but made too cheap.","I bought this cooler to try to use in my truck (big rig), and it does help some as long as it isn't super hot. It helps if I leave the windows down a little to let in a little fresh air so it doesn't get to humid inside, and therefore quit cooling. The remote control doesn't work even after I got another remote from the seller. I decided it wasn't worth the hassle of sending the whole thing back to exchange it."
4,"Great, sleek, but NOT real leather...","Well, I think my title covers it... this case is very attractive, it's well designed and fits snugly (but not tight) around the classic i-pods, the holes for headphones and the hold button are perfect, BUT it's not real leather as advertsied. That said, it's a great case for the price, and looks just as good as the real thing."
5,Heart molds,"We use these cake pans to make hand and feet cast molds in the childrens hospital locally when a baby or child dies. Had a hard time finding the appropriate sizes, but these are perfect. Should last for years."
5,Great! Lot of FUN!,"You get a book and a few little special lego pieces in this kit. The lego pieces are typical lego quality- sturdy and fairly easy to use. You follow the directions in the book and using the special lego pieces and the legos you already have at home, you can build some cool contraptions. Some are easier than others to build. However, all are doable and all live up to my expectations. Very Fun.Enjoy.IF you are like I am and look for toys that are quality toys that encourage creativity and exploration of the world around you, Lego toys are great. If you look for toys that have more than a button to push, lego toys are great. The toys are quality toys that can grow with your child and continually be added to to make new and exciting things."
5,AWESOME! Too Much Fun!,"My husband and I purchased this book for our son for Christmas. I was a little startled by the price, but thought we'd try it anyway. Wow! We spent the entire afternoon making these contraptions. Some of the contraptions may be too difficult for younger kids to build, so parents join in on the fun! Just imagine, you too could have fishing line running across your living room for the Tapdoor Cable Car Parachute Machine to zoom on."
5,Great gift for any lego builder,"My opinion is that legos shouldn't come with instructions. I grew up with legos, and had a lot of fun making up my own models. When I watch kids play with legos today, they don't seem to get the idea that you can do a lot more with them than what is printed on the box. This book quite nicely addresses that problem by showing some of the most crazy contraptions I've seen. They do very clever things with legos, and make models that actually move and do things. My favorite is the candy dispenser that you can load up with M&Ms or Skittles. Highly recommended."
4,We all love it!,"We got this for our four year old at the time. He is almost 7 now, and we all still enjoy choosing instructions from this book to work on together. I do think the pouch is a little small for all the pieces.The zip line ""robot"" as my kids call it doesn't work so great, but otherwise, we've enjoyed all the projects - takes between 8 and 15 minutes to build one, if we don't stop to play together. I agree that if the child is 8 or older, this would be something they would need very little help with. Of course, you need to have a few legos already, as this one only has the specialized pieces inside. Oh - and a few rubberbands, as well. Ours broke rather quickly.Sra. GoseMother of Five, Spanish Teacher, AuthorFlip Flop Spanish"
2,Won't take an edge,"Feels like a nice, solid blade & good materials. Sheath is very nice. However, this knife was not particularly sharp out of the box, and while I don't usually have much trouble getting knives shaving sharp, I cannot for the life of me get this blade to take a decent edge - not even enough to ""break"" the hairs of my arm. I'm rather disappointed."
1,Good materials/Lousy workmanship,"Just got this knife today from Sportsman's Guide. Nice leather sheath. The materials used in the knife appeared to be of very good quality, but the workmanship was horrible. The rivets used to attach the stag handle to the knife were uneven and poorly finished. The middle rivet on the knife I received was sticking out close to 1/8th of and inch and was sharp around the edge. I actually got a small cut on my hand from it while inspecting the knife. If this is ""German craftmanship"" you can have it. Maybe the Germans should just make the components and have them assembled in China. Whoops, looks like Puma beat me to the punch and are now doing just that with at least some of their knives! Probably will wind up with a better knife than the ones assembled Germany at present. Very disappointing what has happened to what used to be a top of the line brand."
2,disappointed,"""C'est la Vie"" is a favorite of mine. I like his voice, the sweetness of the songs, along with the variety and afro-rhythms, but this latest, ""Mot'a Bobe"" is too saccharine, too slick, produced, euro-french for my taste. I was very disappointed."
4,Excellent for the money,This was my first car speaker installation ever done. Took me a while to get it done because of the different size of the speakers compared to the stock ones but in the end I could say it was worth it. My car stock has 4x7 in it so the 5.25 was a noticeable upgrade. I can turn the radio all the way up and get no distortion what so ever and it plays highs and mids clearly and loud. The lows arent all that good but you shouldnt expect loud bass from a 5.25 speaker thats what subs are for. This speaker is a excellent upgrade if your car has stock 4x7. Next time I upgrade my doors I will go gor 6.5s and see how those sound.
4,I like colors,"We have always seen the Second World War in black and white but why not a little bit in colors, the way that are parents and grand parents have seen it the streets, in the air and on the sea. Shooted some time by ordinary people, it is a different point ov view about the war. Very interesting if you are interested by the real story."
1,Very disappointing.,"World War 2 in Color - The British Story is an enormous disappointment simply because it lacks the narration by John Thaw as advertised on Amazon's website and also on the DVD sleeve notes. In fact it lacks any kind of narration at all and while the pictures are fascinating and good quality they are virtually meaningless without an explanatory narrative.I've got a copy of this programme on VHS so am able to make an accurate comparison. The video is identical to the VHS but the audio is missing from the DVD. It's therefore not the same product.It's possibly significant that the DVD which I have received has a completely different cover to that shown on this review page and I believe Amazon should have a good look at this as they are clearly selling a product which is not exactly as advertised.Summing up I'd say 'Buyer beware'. Without the narrative the DVD is as good as useless.Sincerely,Ken Taylor."
4,A great source of ideas (for stroytellers),"This book is a great addition for the storyteller in general. Players may even use it, but you, the master of the world is the one to really explore it. In a few words, this book, and specially the rare artifacts in it, gave me great plot ideas, and not only for a technocratic based chronicle, but all kinds of ways. The weird item section is a great source for dealing with marauders, nephandi and some disconnected mages. Another good thing in the book is that, with it, you can control the ""overpowered"" kind of player, you know, the one that spends every xp he got on ways of busting .... Put a X-14 A Thunderhead on his face and see what happens... good to shut some mouths... In short, it's a great source book, note the best of them all, but a good one. But be wise to what you give to your players. And a recomendation: never ever let a player got the technocratic exo-skeleton. Believe me, you'll regret it."
3,"Good, but not great.","I'll cut to the chase: The biggest drawback to this recording is Alfredo Kraus' Duke. His voice is too small and weak to make me believe he's a womanizing Duke. He sounds more like a 15 year old horny teen. It doesn't help that his high notes are pinched, strained, and sometimes downright ugly. Anna Moffo is better, but even she sounds kind of like an unknown soprano you'd hear in a provincial opera company. She's got all the notes, but there's just nothing special there. The real star here is Robert Merrill: Outstanding singing and acting. If you don't care who sings the Duke, and Gilda is secondary to you, buy this set for Merrill's Rigoletto. Otherwise look elsewhere. A good start is the recording with Scotto, bergonzi, and Fischer-Dieskau."
1,OS X is flawed for server work,I love OS X but what do you buy a server for?... to centralize tasks such as web hosting and databases. This article:http://www.anandtech.com/mac/showdoc.aspx?i=2520points out how OS X is horribly crippled to handle such server tasks when compared to Linux running on a G5 or an AMD chip. The article is very fair and every effort was made to figure out what went wrong and the conclusion was that OS X has very poor threading functionality - something critical server applications like mysql and apache under heavy load.The Linux running on the G5 is upwards of 1000% faster than OS 10.4. Given the cost of Linux I'm not sure what would prompt me to purchase this server OS for 10 times worse performance on the same Apple hardware. I also find it ironic that Apple has touted the benefits of a single company making hardware and OS for years and this is the result. Embarassing.
2,Dashboard crashes iMac more than Panther ever did,"For one year I ran Panther on my new iMac. Virtually no problems and no crashes. I have crashed more times with Tiger in one month than ever before. I think it is Dashboard and I only have a couple of the native widgets in use. What a shame - they are so cool. But I want my flawless, stable iMac back. Why won't Apple acknowledge this obvious problem?"
2,Not What I Expected,"I use fine or ultra fine permanent markers every day. I like how the fine point Marks A Lot pens write. They tip does seem to lose its shape a bit as they age, so the written line gets a bit wider. At first, I thought they might be my Sharpie replacements. That is not to be. I just went though a box of 12 in 2-3 months. Some only wrote for a few days. The same size box of Sharpies would last 2-3 times as long. Another thing that annoyed me was that I had to scribble on scrap paper to get them to write at full strength if I'd stopped writing for a few minutes. I wasted time, ink, and paper doodling so they would write correctly."
5,It's black and draws lines,"Pens arrived quickly and in good condition. They are all black, as they should be. I was a little disappointed that they would not draw a straight line without a ruler but I guess you cannot have everything :) Oh, the product is great by the way."
3,Weak Sauce for Ed Gorman,"Many of Gorman's strengths are on display -- vibrant characterization, fluid dialogue, and the ability to write high-stakes, bravura scenes that rend the reader's heart. However, the main premise is implausible and the plot structure is needlessly byzantine. Also this work contains a lot of writerly vamping -- as if Mr. Gorman's contract called for 200 more pages than this story would intrinsically support, so he filled it up with needless viewpoint shifts to unimportant minor characters. If you haven't read the Sam McCain books -- go read one of those first."
2,Fair to partly cloudy,"This book was helpful in organizing the thought processes medically; however, I would have flunked the CSA had I depended solely on it. I also had copies of review course notes which have some warm-and-fuzzies that are vital to the candidate. If a book is written that combines both the info in this book and the other info in the review courses, that one will be a must-have winner."
1,not enough for the csa,The book is too simple to suit the purpose of preparing you for the CSA. It has many blank pages and the discussions are too superficial. It does not tell you how to write a patient's note which is the most important component of the exam.
3,Too many empty pages!,The book is good to give you an idea about what you can expect to see on CSA exam. Unfortunately it has only 52 cases and it doesn't cover the writing part of the exam (how you should write your findings accordingly with USA standards)
2,Nothing Special,"I bought this album in the 70's and after maybe one play, instantly forgot about it. Now that I've burned it to CD and have listened to it again, I can see why. It is by no stretch awful, but this album sounds like a bunch of cover tunes with a few originals thrown in, and just adequately played. At times, I get a distinct Allman Brothers feel, or a country blues feel, but nothing earthshaking. Even while listening to Mr. Skin, I kept hearing the Spirit version over this one.I had heard these guys were a pretty good band and maybe their first album is, but this later album from them pales in comparison. So, this one is going to languish on the shelf just like the vinyl album did. Yeah, I got a whiff of something, and it wasn't great rock."
1,Next in line from the UK,"Juicy Lucy, The Tea Set, The Move and on and on, kind of reminds me of the Benny Hill Show, you know, now you see them and now you don't, you get it?"
1,a different band,"This is not the same band that produced the excellent, mind blowing, heavy and psychedelic first album with the earth shaking and definitely unique vocals. The only original members, if I remember correctly, were the reeds, and the steel guitar. The sax is almost non-existent, the riffs are weak, and the version of Midnight Rider is pale compared to the Allman original, and can barely even stand next to Willie's version. I'm not sure whose band the original was, but they have left..."
2,It's hard and delicate,This product is not very good. The tissue paper rips so easily and it's really hard to make. I am 12 so I am the main target audience and it did not work out to well for me. I gave two stars because I didn't think it was a total fail its just not right for me I guess.
2,Hard to do,"Bought this for my 6 year old niece who loves to craft because I remember making tissue paper flowers as a kid. The tissue paper is very thin and it makes it extremely difficult to craft the flower without tearing it. Actually, I wasn't able to craft a flower without tearing off several pieces. My niece got frustrated and began using the pipe cleaners to craft animals. It is a great idea but the tissue is not strong enough for the craft. I suggest just buying a pack of tissue paper and pipe cleaners."
3,"Okay craft, a bit difficult for younger hands","My seven year old daughter and I recently bought this set for our craft day activity. It was fun, and we eventually created beautiful paper flowers, but not without a lot of trial and error.We ended up working together to fold and fluff the flowers, and my three year old even helped us.I think we would have been better off buying our own tissue paper and pipe cleaners and following a tutorial online though."
1,"If tissue paper gets wet, it leaves a Permanent Stain","I bought this to entertain ten seven-year-olds at a party during ""craft time"". The kids had fun, and the flowers were fairly easy to make, especially for the girls who had already learned the accordion fold in an art class. Several of the moms enjoyed it too.That was the good news. The bad news came the day after the party, when we realized that someone had dropped some tissue shreds on the floor, which had apparently gotten wet (there was a milk spill at one point), and now there are permanent red stains on our hardwood floor. Even Lestoil couldn't beat it.If you are looking for a fun party craft, you might want to go for it---just be prepared for that permanent souvenir. Otherwise, try something else."
2,Not that great...,"Okay, so, tissue paper is thin to begin with ... but the paper included with this item is extra thin and constantly rips. Very frustrating. We've wasted more paper than made flowers. Ended up buying our own tissue paper to use with the other included supplies."
2,Paper Bleeds,"I have three little girls and we make paper flowers frequently. I purchased this kit to have for a birthday party - less prep! I was so disappointed when the girls' fingers turned blue, purple, green, pink... as did my table and anything else the flowers touched."
3,giant paper flowers,"I had bought these for my daughters 7th birthday party as one of the crafts. Well, it didn't end up how I imagined. The kids were having a difficult time with everything and the paper ripped fairly easy. I made a few of the flowers for some of the girls and I was ripping paper here and there. I did like all the variety of colors and that the paper came precut with different edges, that made things go a lot faster. However, there was one set up paper that was cut like fringe and it was nearly impossible to make those into flowers without it ripping like crazy.I would recommend this for older girls, maybe ages 9/10 and older, it was just to hard for the girls under this age and they lost interest pretty quickly."
4,Makes great flowers... very delicate,"The finished product is soo cute. Great colors and lots of options, but the tissue paper is very thin (well, its tissue paper). Kids couldn't be careful enough, they got frustrated when it would rip. I had an easier time, but still ripped a couple.We made some up and gave them to teachers one day of Teacher appreciation week. They went over well. The kit has a ton of paper so we have lots more to make and practice on.We found the video on amazon is very helpful."
2,so disappointed,I do home daycare made the purchase for the kids to make paper was so thin I even tore it while trying to make flowers would not recommend!!
1,Anyone who gave this DVD 5 stars can kiss my ASS!!!,"You little BritPhiles and sleazy jailbait hunting old farts, are responsible for promoting this lack of talent in the music industry and have destroyed the hopes and careers of more promising musicians. I just hope this utter waste of plastic is the beginning of the end for this plastic trailer trash ho! She and her boyband cohorts will be exposed when we all find out that the record labels have been cooking the books-ala EnRon-when it comes to album sales. This DVD (I won't even say it's name) is just down in the gutter as far as reality TV is concerned."
2,deberas que britney esta en decadencia,esta serie esta bein chafa toda mal grabada y se ve que britney esta en decadencia y se le sale su lado puerco que tenia dentro el cd que trae esta muy chafa ya que trae como tres canciones nada mas en lugar de que britney las hubiera incluido en su nvo disco que esperemos pronto grave un nvo disco es un desperdicio de dinero NO LO COMPREN
1,"""CHAOTIC"" IS NOT A MISNOMER","When this series played on UPN, I was just as fascinated by it as I currently am by the New Orleans Hurricane Katrina footage on CNN. Both are out-of-control trainwrecks, getting crazier, more horrifying, more f***ed up, and more (dare I say) CHAOTIC by the minute. Being self-mesmerized (Britney by her narcissism and K-Fed by his greed and venality), both Mr. and Mrs. Federline are perfect retards, and they truly deserve each other. Just the post-ceremony, reception sequence (in which the males and females wear matching ghetto-track suits) is worth the price of this DVD set. I know I gave this series a 1-star, but if you can stomach the horrifying and absurd, I HIGHLY recommend watching this."
3,"Horrible Show, Great Bonus'","Ok, so I am a huge Britney fan, but this show really was the most boring, useless, unflattering show ever! With that said I will still by the DVD and am excited that it is coming out because of the bonus materials. The Bonus CD will be enough for it because ""someday"" and ""chaotic"" are both really good songs. Stick to Music and Acting Britney and leave reality television to the has beens."
2,Someone please help them,"This show is absolutely horrible. It's called ""Britney & Kevin: Chaotic"" yet it seems to be all Britney for the most part. Yeah, they're in love it seems which is good, but Britney? Honestly? The girl can't film right, she moves the camera around too much and she sounds like a drunken Girls Gone Wild with her jokes about favorite sexual positions. The show is too dark for me as well. Does Kevin sit and talk to the camera at all like Britney has in her own little ""Real World Confessions"" type thing? No, I didn't think so."
1,Horrible,Buyer beware! This is a waste of money. It is actually painful to watch poor Britney in this mockumentary. K-Fed came across as the sane one in this one.
4,whatever,"my g/f loves britney spears. so she watched the show, and then just had to have the dvd.whatever, maybe it'll become a collectors item since they are devorced now!"
5,Britney And Kevin are entertaining,"I liked the show no matter what the critics say. I thought Britney Spears was very funny and real. She seems like a real fun person to hang out with. I don't think being a celebrity has changed her personality much. I have always liked her but I still don't like Kevin Federline, he seems nice and real cool but I just think Britney could have and should have done better. But that's just my opinion."
1,Oh my God can someone please end thier lives now?!,"This is the worst show ever. And you know what the funny thing is? I didn't even watch the show. Britney Spears needs to just shut the hell up. She isn't hot and she isn't funny. All she is is just trailer trash. and her dumba** of a husband should be thrown in Compton of East L.A and see what a real gangsta is. I feel sorry for thier kid that he has to live with these retards. I hope that one day they get what they deserve. If anyone honestly buys this DVD, and likes it, you shouldn't be allowed to live. If anyone buys me this, I am going to destroy it right in their faces and tell ask them what they were on when they bought this. Please God, do something about all these celebrities who think they are Gods.mr.eleFantZero stars. I hate how we have to put one star even if we absolutely hated it."
1,Question,"Does anyone know if there is a list of songs played during each episode? I really liked a song that was played during the wedding episode...had lyrics that stated, ""Today is the sweetest day that I..."". It was playing when Britney was getting ready. Any help with this would be greatly appreciated."
1,GRRRRR,"IF anyone choose to buy this at Christmas for me, I would have to say you SHOULDN't Have. I would ask for the recipt and scold the person for thinking I would even CONSIDER wanting to watch this non talent and her baby making husband. GRRRRRRRRRRRRRR"
5,INteresting,Shows the behind the scenes look at Britney on tour and when she meets Kevin. Definitely great to have if you are a big Britney fan!
5,I love Britney!,"Great personal documentary about Brit's life behind the scenes when her relationship with K-Fed was brand new. Shows that she is a real human being who has alot of the same life issues as the rest of us. Not a big fan of K-Fed, but he was Britney's object of affection so I dealt with it. : )"
4,K-otic!,"It's not a must have cause it's not a musical dvd with performances and stuff, but the Bonus part is just great! The video quality of ""Do Somethin"" and ""Someday (I Will Understand)"" is GREAT. Full screen you can enjoy Britney dancin her 'selfmade' video of ""Do Somethin'"" and the beautiful ballad ""Someday (I Will Understand)"".It is very funny to watch her have the time of her life, tough she's been always busy workin' with music and stuff. I'm happy she finally finds some time to spend on Kevin, altough I don't like the fact he's always partyin' and lettin' Britney with Sean Preston... But the DVD is fun yes :). It'd like to see the following dvd [Chaotic, Part 2] or somethin :P"
1,CRAP NOTHING BUT CRAP,ALWAYS KNEW BRITNEY WAS A WASTE NOW WE HAVE BRITNEY AND KEVIN THE WASTE COUPLE. THIS VIDEO SHOWS JUST HOW YOU CAN TAKE THE PERSON OUT THE TRAILER BUT CANT TAKE THE TRAILER OUT THE PERSON.(BRITNEY AND KEVIN}CRAP!!!!
3,Perfect Condition- Typical Spears,Item was in excellent condition and was received as expected. This purchase was my 14-yr. old daughter and was typical Spears. She enjoyed it though....
5,Talk about a Guilty Pleasure!,"Britney & Kevin: Chaotic is so much fun to watch! It really shows Britney Spears as a real person who is funny, outgoing, and truly loves her friends and family. The show got a lot of flack because Britney isn't prim and proper but isn't that what we have always loved about Britney? Not to mention, when Britney & Kevin finally get married it's really a great and emotional moment!The DVD set sounds great too because we finally get the videos for Someday and Do Somethin! Not to mention the making the videos and the additional CD with three great songs!"
3,chatoic because its so annoying what was i thinking?,chatoic because its so annoying what was i thinking? but it came in great condition and really fast!!!
1,Laughable.,"Those were the days when Britney and K-Fed were madly in love, too bad it didn't last but hey these people need professional help. I am glad America didn't buy into the hype, this is a nice little memory of how dumb Britney could be, how sweet right?"
5,I say it is the best Miyazaki film I have seen that is simple yet great!,I went to the store and found this movie. Since it was miyazaki film and I liked all the ones he did thus far I figured I should get it. I watched it and what a good movie it was. With all these simple made characters I fell soo much in tune to because I can relate in those funny situations. If you like a good humorous anime that deals with everyday life in a family. This movie is perfect. I would recommended it for anyone that wanted a funny anime to watch. A must see!
2,Disappointing,"We have been fans of Studio Ghibli and especially of Hayao Miyakzaki since a friend gave us ""My Neighbor Totoro"" 8 years ago. So I took a chance on this Studio Ghibli film in which Miyakzaki was not involved. This is the only Studio Ghibli video we were disappointed in. The video is a series of shorts that are occasionally funny, but the animation was of a much lower quality. I missed the wonderful storytelling, too, of other Studio Ghibli films. Neither my husband nor I watched the entire video through."
4,Not like the rest of Studio Ghibli,"If you are expecting a My Neighbor Totoro or Kiki's Delivery Service, you will be disappointed.This movie is similar to the '70's ""Wait 'til your Father Gets Home"" cartoon that was on in prime time. It's about a japanese family and it will give you a good feel of what life is like for a normal japanese family (well, a not-so-normal family 8-).It's funny and touching. A fun movie but most young kids probably won't get it or like it."
4,Charming Family Story,"When I was a child, I read this book by well-known Caddie Woodlawn author, Carol Ryrie Brink. Since I grew up and married a professor at a mid-West university, I decided to revisit the book. It's a fun story with lots of football, midwestern culture, and a strong 1950's feel.Any Professor-parent will enjoy sharing this with his/her children. The book is character rather than plot driven, so don't look for lots of action. A little preachy at times, the story conveys values of diligence, sacrifice, creativity, and obedience."
5,My Dear Whippet: Narrow Dog,"As an American Couple who spent 6 weeks in a ""hire-narrowboat"" on the canals of England in the mid-'80's, Jim Whippet and his owner's, the Darlington's account of such living is ""spot-on"". Yes, you'll need to love dogs, english slang, have some expertise with Franglaise (french-enmeshed-with-english) but the book's factual travelogue with associational memories and whippet understandings is a wonderful read.Of course if you expect a plot, a mystery, logical sequencing or the inanities of FOX TV soundbites: Please save yourself the trouble. IF on the other hand, you delight in conversations with real foreigners (British, French and Canine), as well random bits of philosophy, poetry, and fantasies, then BUY THIS BOOK IT'S FUN!"
2,Brit Humor...if you get That ...get THS!,"I'd just returned from a trip down the Rhone in France and thought this would be something I would so love...reliving the experience and all. Well, yes and no. This Darlington fellow obviously can write, and has a wonderful sense of humor. Trouble is, I think I don't much GET British humor...I WANT to, but it didn't always happen in this book! It is a great book for the right reader. For me, not enough description of what he loved about what he saw. And I am not convinced he did see anything he very much enjoyed. He kind of likes seeing the inside of drinking establishments and interacting with undesirables and dogs. Some folks will love it, but it wasn't for me. I shared with a friend who I hope GETS Brits!"
1,big disappointment,"I became interested in this book after reading an ad for the current book by this author. I ordered this book so that I could read the two books in order but was very disappointed. The author writes in a stream-of-consciousness manner and even though I found some of it humorous, I was not engaged enough to struggle with the writing."
2,Boring,"I didn't care for the book much. There were bits and pieces that were humourous, but overall, I didn't find it all that funny. That was disappointing, because I think the author can be quite humorous.I think, as others have mentioned, Darlington was trying too hard to show how erudite he was by including as many references to songs, books, quotes, poetry, etc. as he could. I'm well read and well traveled, but I didn't know what he was talking about half of the time.And even though this was about a boat trip, if I had to read one more ad nuasuem description of the locks they passed through, I would have screamed. Enough already!One more thing-it drove me CRAZY that there were absolutely no quotation marks in the book-made it very hard to read."
2,An acquired taste,"As others have said, the author's writing style is contrived and tedious. Obviously it appeals to some (withness the good reviews), but not to me.I wanted to enjoy the book, but just couldn't get into it at all. Too bad, because I'm sure there was a good story waiting to be told: crossing the Channel via narrowboat, fancy!"
5,"heavy industrial use, not a problem!","As I've said before I'm a pipe fitter, and I can say that I actually use this everyday. It's dedicated use is with a Pferd 6"" carbide bit for cleaning spatter out of pipe. Being that it's constantly exposed to grinding dust and welding sparks and it's still going, that's pretty good. Oh yea, I've had it for about a year now. This tool is very quiet, produces very little vibration and has more than enough power for me. Oh yea, one more thing, PAY ATTENTION to the rpm ratings on bits that you use for this!! If you don't it will vibrate badly because the bits cannot stay balanced at 23,000 rpm. So, you'll have to spend extra on bits. Weiler brand grinding stones are about the best you can buy at the local hardware store."
4,Strong product!,I bought this wile rebuilding the engine in my 72 Bronco. I had to shave down some parts of the exhaust manifold to get them to fit with my new aftermarket heads and this thing worked beautifully. It is every bit as powerful and strong as a comparable air tool.If you want an electric grinder when a air tool just won't do than this is your product.
3,not as pictured,"These cards are good quality, were delivered quickly, and in excellent condition. The gold foil was as described. However, the artwork IS NOT AS PICTURED IN THE EXAMPLE ON AMAZON PAGE. The devil was a traditional devil figure, not the two headed beast as pictured, and the tower was a simple, singular tower, not the burning wall as pictured. The artwork is crude as if drawn by a child at times on the minor arcana, and even the back of the cards is different than pictured (a black background with flowers versus the burgundy pictured). Needless to say, I'm disappointed. I'd expected and wanted the artwork shown, not the poorly rendered, simple artwork I received."
4,great,"this album clearly shows the evolution that lorenzo went through in the past 10 years. you will enjoy amazing and innovative sounds from one of the few italian artists that are in touch and updated on the music trends in the world. refreshing introspective analysis of himself and his life, showing a great feeling of accomplishment A certain don't miss. Favorites: ""luna di citta' d'agosto"" and ""il re"""
2,no title,"Please note that I am only reviewing the novel ""Skeeters Kirby"", not the entire 56 volume set (I can't imagine).Ultimately, an unsatisfying book, and not particularly exciting to read either. There's a flatness here, a distancing, as if the author were not quite ready to give of himself. Too many episodes, scenes, characters, are merely fleshed out, cut and dried, with no substance, vigor, or life. Even the title character seems to have no real emotions. Second part of a trilogy. I think this is supposed to be somewhat autobiographical. Set in southern Illinois and Chicago from 1890-1911. The first part is done in a kind of Tom Sawyerish speech, extremely irritating to read. But when he grows out of it, it's still heavy, turgid, flat. Characters come in and go out with dizzying rapidity. However, it is quite obvious that sexual mores were really no different then from now. Even women were quite free."
3,Clean out and Beware of Bogus reviewing...,"Why Can't Amazon start cleaning out all the obviously bogus reviews written by the writers hired-reviewers and friends. Read the only other 2 reviews below that DONT have 5-stars. A good one below from December 31, 2005 is titled: ""Another Music Lawyer, Another Book to Milk the Hopeful Masses, December 31, 2005By Anna Lee""."
4,author is credible and knowledgeable.,"my opinion is based on a google preveiw of the book and i have not read the whole book, i find the author quite authoritative, credible and in a position to talk about the subject at hand considering him being a lawyer whos job it is to know his way around this business. this book seems full of useful facts about the history, trends AND the future of the music business, this seems to cover the subject fairly well. i will be buying it. i was dissapointed about some of the other reveiwers claims for fake reveiws for this book, it almost drew me away , so i would like to draw other people towards it.Perhaps they have not distinguished that the book covers the future of the music business and not the future of music in an artistic sense, that may be why people were disappointed. only four stars because i have not read the whole thing yet, but plan on buying it. kudos to the author for writing this book!"
4,"short book that tells you all. nice pictures, v. recomended!","If you are looking for a short book that tells you all about the international style in Tel-Aviv and Israel, you will find it here + lots of good B/W pictures."
3,"I like that it does ""different"" moves...","Well, it was different! Different approach & different moves. And that's a plus to me, because I like to do different workouts all the time so that I'm not working my muscles the same way each time. My muscles never know what to expect and get worked totally and/or slightly different every time I workout! The instructor was not the lady on the cover of the box (you never see her) - she was someone different - a skeleton covered with skin! Way toooo skinny! 90's outfits & hair. Though not a great workout, not a terrible one either - I broke a sweat. They use light hand weights."
1,Turner looses the readers trust from the beginning.,"The methodology used by Turner is to put it mildly, unprofessional. Therefore, he looses credibility from the beginning of the book leaving one questioning throughout: what is fact vs. what is fabrication?Furthermore, he makes huge assumptions and conclusions citing secondary sources of which he displays little if any understanding. Lastly, he misconstrues even a basic understanding of western musical vocabulary: e.g., fugue, polyphony, form, etc.I would not recommend this book other than as an example of bad scholarship."
1,Oh Boy...!,"I bought this on the advice of a JFK researcher and he said that this was one of those to get. You don't need this book. It offers nothing new. Not another perspective, no new info, nothing needed in reading this book. If you need some books, go with Jim Marrs' ""Crossfire,"" Jim Garrison's ""On the Trail of the Assassins,"" Gaeton Fonzi's ""The Last Investigation"" and Anthony Summers ""Not in Your Lifetime."" Those books draw it all together and offer a lot of first-hand knowledge.This book is poorly written, not cohesive and offers nothing at all but another writer's outline of other writer's work. Who needs it?"
3,A little misleading,"The title of this book is misleading. It should actually be ""The Torah with Sources Revealed."" Some comments are made on other early history books in the OT, but it is virtually all on the Torah, and mostly consists of a new translation with different sources indicated by color and font. As such it is the most complete treatment of the source theory I have seen, but for a non-expert such as me, the translation could at least use more footnotes. For instance, Exodus 1:15-16 is translated ""And the king of Egypt said to the Hebrew midwives...and you look at the two stones, if it's a boy...The New Oxford Annotated Bible gives ""...and see them on the birthstool, if it's a boy..."""
2,The Best of the 19th Century...,"Friedman's text is an excellent review, with slight expansion, of Wellhausen's ""Prolegomena."" Friedman's fault lies in his complete disregard for a century of scholarship that has significantly undermined the validity of the Documentary Hypothesis."
1,Will this author's next book be on the validity of phlogiston theory?,This book is nothing but a rehashing of an outdated and disproved theory. The Documentary Hypothesis has been found to be completely without merit. To read this author you wouldn't know that in the last 100 years DH has been shredded beyond repair by biblical scholars. This book is dishonest and a complete waste of time for anyone who isn't merely looking to support their own misconceptions.
3,Do NOT buy the Kindle Edition,"While the content of the first couple of chapters is indeed a spectacularly succinct and illuminating introduction to the Documentary Hypothesis, the main meat of the book, the text linking to sources is impossible to read.The original text was printed in color, something that obviously does not translate to the Kindle at all, I had hoped they would endeavor to change the formatting to make the sources more apparent or perhaps used different fonts, but they have not done so, with the exception of the use of bold text or italics for a couple of the sources, it's impossible to discern one from the other."
3,One of the WWE's better movies,"AJ (Triple H) has just been released from prison and all he wants to do is...make pickles. But,Jack (Michael Rapaport), AJ's screw up friend that stole his girlfriend Claire (Parker Posey) when he was in prison, gets them in a whole lot of trouble.Jack accidentally kills a man during a simple job for his father Dr. Vic (Bruce Dern) and steals the money in a briefcase that was left behind. Now, AJ finds himself stuck in the middle and has to choose a side between father and son when, again he just wants to....make pickles.Triple H is surprisingly good even though WWE wrestlers are so gigantic that they often look awkward on film and Triple is no exception. But when everyone else in the movie isn't that easy to like, you find yourself rooting for AJ. Michael Rapaport is a likable actor but his character is just so careless and immature that I didn't care if he winded up in a ditch somewhere."
1,this movie has epic fail written all over it,"this movie is just beyond unintelligent and boring wwe has stop making movies none of the wrestlers can act hulk hogan cant act neither can the rock wwe films should just stop making movies because all the movies they make and release are epic fails and are seriously boring and lame im sorry wrestling fans but Vincent Kennedy ""Vince"" McMahon destroyed my childhood"
2,"Save your money, only worth renting","i am a big WWE fan and used to like seeing triple H in old movies like Blade... Even the chaperone was better then this no action movie that pretty much went nowhere. IT seems like everytime WWE films is involved, the movie itself ends up turning out horrible. Theirs a reason these kind of movies always go straight to dvd's... because majority of the time they aren't worth buying and not worth even watching."
1,Worthless!,"There is no search tool, as advertised in the description. You get 12 CD's, and an image viewer which operates like Explorer. Without search capabilities, or a hard-copy book with a thorough index, all I have is a bunch of files on 12 CD's. Whoopee."
5,"Intelligent, witty read.","Well told, humorous but intense love story with a hint of mystery and suspense. A very fast read and I am now back tracking and reading Dodd's other related book, A Well Pleasured Lady."
3,Well Favored Gentleman,"This is actually a beautiful story, a mixed of historical romance with a touch of fantasy written in the excellent style of Christina Dodd.I just cannot say I loved it because during the first half of the book I HATED Ian ( one step too close to be an abusive character, that makes no good hero for me ) and also found silly how Alana allows his behavior and falls in love with him despite ( or because of, not sure ) of it...Still, I really enjoyed the fantasy elements related to the selkies and the ending is very touching so if you don't mind the hero/heroine's ""peculiar"" relationship, then it is worth reading it."
2,Meh.,"What more can I say? I was ready to strangle Wilda, to tell Alanna to get her act together, to thrash Ian soundly for raping a woman, to kill off his father (who was already ailing), and several other ""characters"", none of whom were at all vital to the core story but simply annoying. If you are a Dodd fan who must read all her works, go ahead. But be warned: this is rather a stinker, even with the lovely potential for magic (never well-enough developed).OK - it's ""old Dodd"" (1998), but still... she surely knew better. There are few scenes less believable than those in which Ian suddenly ""realizes"" or ""understands"" something... Oy. I'm glad I came out of this one alive. If it didn't have selkies and that bit of magic, I'd give it one star."
2,Selkie man meets witch woman and sparks fly!,"I have a problem with romances in which the hero rapes the heroine, especially when she is asleep. We've come a long way, baby, and we don't need this. Dodd's fantasy romance, set in Scotland, also suffers from an excess of plot. Disappointing effort from someone who's written better."
3,Good but not her best,"Love Christina Dodd; in the midst of reading all her books. This one was a bit disappointing - seemed more far-fetched than I could really imagine, and I can imagine a lot. I did love Ian and Alanna, and the story was robust, just too many twists and turns."
2,Terrible,"Very disappointing, one of the worst books I've ever read. Most of her other books are wonderful and I expected the same quality but this one was awful."
5,"One of my favorite ""read it again"" novels","I liked ""A Well Pleasured Lady"" but didn't love it. Still, it was good enough for me to read its sequel, ""A Well Favored Gentleman"". I loved this story and consider it the best of Dodd's novels. An excellent interweaving of myth and romance!I really enjoyed the fact that Ian wasn't your typical 'handsome but dissolute Regency rake'. It was even better that his secret was so realistically a deal-breaker - despite the enthusiastic fantasy of ""alien romance"" novels, the truth is most people fear what they don't understand, and are reluctant to accept the ones who are 'different'.This makes you feel that Alanna and Ian are honestly fortunate to have found one another, making for a believable and charming love story."
2,whatever,what the hell was christina dodd thinking when she wrote this stupid story about seal love. how could anyone enjoy reading about a half seal and half man. and what woman would want to make love to a seal. i was lauphing when he was recalling his childhood. his seal mother should have let him drowned.
1,selkie love is all wet,"this was one of the worst books i have ever read. the whole story line must have been thought of in a nightmare. seals belong in the sea not in a romance novel. my advice, save the seals for the zoo and skip this joke!"
5,Electrifying Performance of Tubin's Symphonies,"Eduard Tubin is not a popular composer. However, his symphonies have mixture of Romantic timbre, Estonian music and rhythm, and more modern dissonant sound. His 3rd symphony is a Romantic piece with vivid, distinct rhythm and astounding codas for the 1st and the last movements. His 8th symphony is a more solemn work with mixture of dissonance and conssonance. Estonian rhythm is still very vivid. An Estonian conductor, Neeme Jarvi, and the Swedish Radio Symphony Orchestra recorded their electrifying performance. Tubin's symphonies should receive more attention and performances in concert halls. I look forward to listening to concert performance of his symphonies."
1,WARNING a waste of money!,"I normally do not bother to take the time to write reviews because other readers do such a good job reviewing a book but this one seems to have missed. I am not a writer but I do appreciate a well-written book and Lowy book was anything but. It was a low quality, self-published book where they forgot to edit it and stretched every sentence to reach the 135 pages. This book can be summed up in a pamphlet. Save your money buy something else such as eBay timesaving techniques. This book was painful to read. It is not for beginners, intermediate, or advanced sellers. I am a eBay powerseller and I can not think of anytime this book could of helped me compared to the other great books out there."

2,Heads of pins were massive,"While the fit and finish of the bridge pins was very good, I found the heads of them to be too large for my tasts."
2,He wanted your (same) sex!!,"This video was released during the height of George's popularity, which plummeted soon afterward due to ""unfavorable publicity"" regarding his ""wanting your sex"" in public restrooms!This video has also plummeted in value as well, although it contains a rather steamy uncensored video for I Want Your Sex. Other songs that are on this video, are as follows: Faith, Father Figure, One More Try, and Monkey. If you look at the song titles now, what impressions do you get???"
3,Same Old Carr,"Carr's classic What is History? appears in this book in full text as it did in 1961. What also appears is seventy-odd pages of prefatory material. While this material, including Carr's notes toward a second edition, Carr's preface to his unwritten second edition, and an in-depth introduction by Richard J. Evans is interesting enough, none of it seemed to merit the publication of a new edition. The historiography of Carr has progressed considerably in the last forty years, and the introductory material reviews it well, but it includes nothing seminal. Furthermore, the added material lacks the colorful vivacity that characterizes Carr's What is History? The bottom line is that the meat and potatoes of Carr is still Carr, and it's just not worth spending the extra money on the new edition when there are copies of the older editions available."
4,"Unoriginal, yes, but still enjoyable book for women.","Although I agree with the other reviewers who compared this book to Bridget Jones' Diary, I disagree with the premise that you shouldn't read it based on its lack of originality alone. Although clearly similar to Bridget Jones and other books of that vain, I found that Me Times Three has a more serious element (similar to Jennifer Weiner's Good in Bed). Set in NYC during the 1980s, the book does focus on romantic relationships and the working world but also addresses more serious issues such as AIDS. The title really doesn't fully encompass the story--yes, the main character discovers that her fiance is engaged to two other women, but this quickly becomes a minor plotline as the story progresses to other issues. The book is both funny and touching, and overall, I found it to be an engaging read which I would recommend to anyone else who enjoys books of this genre."
2,Stinker times three,I'm probably the only other person (outside of the author's family) who read (or tried to finish) her previous book. I should have known better than to pick up her latest.This was a weak attempt of fluff and a carbon copy of all the other post-Bridget Jones wannabe books out there. Save your money and borrow it from a friend.
1,Boring Boring Boring!!!,"I bought this book thinking it was another great chick lit, especially given Sarah Jessica Parkers review. I rarley put a book down before finishing it, but this was so slow it was painful. Don't bother!!"
1,crap,"I'm sorry but unless this woman had a gay friend who died of aids, she is a horibly predicatable writer that needs to get over the stereotype. First of all ""of course he has aids, he's gay"" ?????? I thought this stereotype was dead.Also, I found myself wondering if I gapped out or something, because the woman never finishes a scene - Your in the office one page and the next your at a dinner party."
2,"Sadly, not worth it","I couldn't wait to get this book. I enjoy this genre, and the hype behind this book (already set to be a motion picture starring Gwyneth Paltrow) made me think that it was a worthy read. However, the book is all over the place...so many different characters introduced and then erased from the page, and then all the flashbacks. This book doesn't seem to know what it wanted to be, and sadly it tries to be all and fails miserably."
2,Manhattan in the 80's,"Sandra Berlin is one of the junior up and coming stars of the New York magazine world, working as assistant and general dogsbody to the senior staff at Jolie fashion magazine. The love of her life is her fiance, Bucky, who preceded her to New York and who welcomed her arrival as a new graduate with enthusiasm until she discovered that he is also engaged to two other women. Sandra is a smart, educated woman but where Bucky is concerned, she turns into a pathetic, self deluding wimp who won't let herself believe that Bucky is a cheating, lying creep who preys on women for his own advantage. Chapters of this book cover the devastating effects that the new disease of AIDS is having on the gay community, and detail the horrifying death of one of Sandra's closest friends. It's not exactly a cheerful read!"
4,It was a surprise,"And I can't really say it was the way this great novel ended, but the way Witchel's witty writing captivated me."
2,Not that great,"With all the good chick-lit books out there, you can certainly do better than this. There really isn't anything all that great about this book. The amazon.com review says that the novel provides a ""delightfully insiderish view of Manhattan,"" but I think it pales in comparison to the much more entertaining ""Sex and the City."" I also thought that being set in the 80s would make it a little different from the other chick-lit books out there, but being set in the 80s really didn't add anything to it at all.I'm so glad I'm not the only reviewer here who was surprised that this book was published! I can't imagine recommending this book to anyone I know. Please pick up a copy of ""See Jane Date"" or ""Jemima J."" instead."
1,may I have a refund?,"There are so many great books out there, so why did I waste my time? This one dishes up one cliche after another, and the writing STINKS. The writer should stick to reporting - I'm sure this book only got published and promoted because she works for the NY Times."
2,I wanted to like this book . . . but . . .,"The writing is good. The story has potential but it didn't keep me interested. I finally had to stop after 160 pages. I don't think it's fair to call it unoriginal--if I had read it before, say Bridget Jones and others like it--than it would have been the first of its kind at least through my eyes. I think the author tries to be funny and a lot of it falls flat, and I simply can't believe this main character is actually a smart person. The plot indicates otherwise. Again, I wanted to like this book. It's a worthy effort, but I think the talented author can do better."
2,Big Fat Yawner...,"Ho-hum. Witty? No, she's not. Not one sentence of thisbook is actually witty. She stumbles all over herself TRYINGto be witty, and does not succeed. There are so many punch lines that fall flat, you find yourself wincing as you reach the end of a sentence, cause you know what's coming.,...something painfully anti-climactic.Now, for real wit, read Rachel Cusk...""In The Country"" (I think that's the name of the book) or ""New Orleans Mourning"" by Julie Smith...those are about single women and they are very, very wry, very amusing, very funny...and yes, witty.She had to have gotten this huge tome of boredom published because she ""knows"" the NY magazine scene.I thought I'd enjoy it, but after I got into it I realized I didn't give a damn, Scarlet."
1,"Whiney, boring and done to death","After eagerly awaiting this book that was so well reviewed by the New York Times (where Witchel writes occasionally and more importantly her husband Frank Rich is a top columnist), I was appalled that such pedestrian writing could pass for wit in the logrolling world of publishing. The one-trick-pony of the fiance who's triple timing her is a dead horse early on, but the author continues to kick it throughout. The heroine is whiney, selfish, shallow and of dubious ethics (love how she rationalizes not bothering to go to her best friend's funeral). Pulling on the tired drama of the gay friend dying of AIDS doesn't add any nobility to this man-hungry social climber. Having read Ms. Witchells dissections of more successful editors in the Homes sections of the Times, it's not too difficult to see how such 'fiction' style comes easily to her."
3,Wait for the paperbook version,"You know how some movies are the type you wait for the video rather than shelling out the $$$ to see it at the movie.With books, the same thing could be said to wait for the paperbook.This book was lite. I found it to be predictable and not the type of book which will stay with me for very long."
2,Too Clever For Its Own Good,"I came to this book ready to laugh, and put it down feeling laugh-deprived. The author had a clever idea, but lacked the stuff to make it work as a novel. I can't figure out whether this is a case of a talented writer trying too hard, or not hard enough."
2,Fluff Times Three,"Witchel sounds like she's writing a novelization of a sitcom episode, with all the depth of a really bad one.She can't even get her facts straight - Bucky, the cheating fiance, is a junior ad exec and he's making a Wall Street level salary. On what planet? Doesn't reflect reality.Characters have no nuance, no depth, and the central premise of the book is never explained to any degree of satisfaction - how did he manage to have 3 fiancees? Why?You could scan the book in about 20 minutes and pick up the entire plot.Hopefully the movie will be better.And I agree with the numerous previous reviewers who pointed out that Witchel is married to Frank ""Butcher of Broadway"" Rich, an influential NY Times columnist and former theater critic. It's all about who you know."
2,Three Too Many,"Like many of the reviewers, I was eager for this book. What a disappointment. I LOVE Alex Witchel, but the novel was badly written. Worse, it was boring. There are a few laughs, but too many cliches and no surprises. Which is too bad, because so much of her writing is lethally funny."
2,Misleading,"At first, the plot seemed interesting enough--three women engaged to one man. Just what were the women going to do, destroy his life? Blackmail him?The answer is nothing at all. The plot was barely there throughout most of the book, keeping at an extremely slow pace and not going into detail. Sandra Berlin, the main character, fails to rouse interest, and I rarely found myself rooting for her, if at all. Even the short stories that Sandra writes are cliche and shallow. This is not one of the best so-called ""chick-lit"" books out there."
1,Boring- cliche,I dont understand what all the hype is about- obviously it helps to have connections.
3,A Quick Read,"I happened to stumble into Me Times Three, and the title is what caught my attention. Although at some points throughout the book, I did chuckle, however, there were many characters that just ""made an appearance"" and then you never heard about them again. This got a little confusing.Over all, the book was good, however, would you really think your boyfriend would have 2 other financee's without you knowing?"
4,Loved it!,"A delightful read. The story line does skip around a lot, though this keeps you reading. Though Sandra [the main character] is somewhat shallow, she remains easy to relate to Admit it - we can all be shallow at times. If you have not gone through some of these situations, your best friend has. I appreciate that Sandra remained faithful to the same man for 9 yrs, something unheard of in today's climate. Yes, there is the cliché of her gay best friend contracting Aids. Face it, it happens. We don't always have to be PC to have a fabulous book. Don't read this book if you are looking for the deeper meaning of life, read it if you are looking for a little enjoyment."
4,Me Times Three,"This was a good book, not great. It was definitely not a Bridget Jones & a bit dark at times. Overall I enjoyed the 80's NYC nostalgia. Character development was ok. Not the best book, but amusing enough."
2,Eh...,"I wanted to like this book, but it simply bored me. Perhaps one had to be of that time and that place (New York in the 1980's) to get thrills out of the supposed true-to-life aspects of this book. But I don't see the appeal to the more average reader. I read a lot, and I have read a lot of similar books, but I just didn't get why this one was hyped, or even published. And did anyone else think the ""good guy"" with whom the protagonist ends up was an anal, selfish creep? I got to the end of this book and saw that the publishing house carefully informed us who the author's husband was, and thought: A-HA. That's why it's getting decent reviews. Fear of Frank Rich."
1,Boredom Times Three,"This book was so boring I stopped in the middle and flipped to the last chapter and still couldn't read the final paragraphs. Although the first chapters start out with promise, the storyline quickly unfolds to boredom. The characters lack depth and emotion. Withchel uses too much narrative rather than letting the characters speak for themselves. But when they do speak, it's uneventful. Pass this one up."
1,Wow this is bad,"This is a really, really bad book. The prose is so bloated one wonders whether Alex had any editing at all. Considering the clout that she and her husband wield, it's no surprise that she got this clunker published, but she definitely should have picked up Elements of Style and learned that less is indeed more. This woman uses enough adverbs to wear out both the reader and the 'l' and 'y' keys on a standard computer keyboard. Don't believe the comparisons to Bridget Jones etc. This is turgid, turgid stuff. The Anna Kournikova of fem. lit. If i were any of the other female writers out there struggling to put out my stuff, I don't know whether I would poo or go blind when I realized that this novel made it to the shelves."
1,Abysmal,"This book was not at all what I expected from reading the synopsis on the back and looking at the fun and playful cover. I was hoping for a fun, interesting read and what I got was a completely boring, depressing waste of time.Do not waste your money on this book. For a good time read anything by Jane Green (Jemima J, Mr. Maybe and Bookends)."
1,"Terrible, terrible","I was curious about this book because Alex Witchel has occassionally written smart, illuminating profiles and essays in The New York Times and thought perhaps some of the wit and wisdom she displays in those pieces would be in her fiction as well. Sadly, there is very little, if any. Perhaps she was over-edited, or encouraged in the wrong direction. But it seems shocking that this bloated, cliched mess would be allowed into print. You would think someone in her life would have sat her down and tell her the truth to protect her from the embarrassment (and her fans from the disappointment). Too bad no one did."
4,Do we have to like her?,"I think that if you take this book for what it's worth... a bit of entertainment, then you will enjoy it. It is definitely not a 'deep' read, but something that you can get through in a couple of days or one long day at the beach/pool. Yes, it'spredictable and maybe it isn't witty. But, at the same time, I can't seem to put it down. So, it must not be too bad. I know that I have read these same plots somewhere else, but they are still entertaining and that's what counts."
1,STINKS ON ICE,"This book is the weakest incarnation yet of the currently popular ""hip girl, lives in NYC, works in publishing, seeks husband"" genre. The heroine's self-loathing is only topped by the hatred she feels toward all other women, or at least those she considers competition. And the worst is, it's not even CLEVER bitchiness. I was rooting for the cheating ex-boyfriend by page 50, I'd drop this ... for the nearest cocktail waitress too. For good writing on similar topic, try Jennifer Weiner's ""Good in Bed""...as far as this book - I left my copy in the dumpster at LAX, I didn't want to inflict this unpleasantly amateur effort on another unsuspecting reader"
1,Inane and a Waste of Time,Who would think such a stylish writer for The New York Times would put her name on such a piece of chicklit drivel? The book is a total waste of time.
3,The author must have connections,"On the back of ""Me Times Three"" there is a blurb from Joan Didion stating that this book is ""witty and wise, an irresistible dissection of love in the city."" For such a pedestrian tale of urban love to even be NOTICED by an esteemed author such as Ms. Didion, the author must know some important people. Otherwise, this book would be gathering dust on the heap of single-gal fiction.I'm nearly to the end, and I'm quite sure I know what the outcome will be. However, Witchel has been a gifted enough author thus far to keep my interest, although it has beguan waning during the book's latter half.The premise is a good one, but like many other reviewers, I felt more could've been done with it. But hey, what do I know? Sarah Jessica Parker liked it, after all."
4,"Cute, fun and a good beach read","This is a fun, cute and fast read. If you read all of Judy Blume growing up, you will love this. It isn't great literature but it doesn't pretend to be."
1,Small and poor quality,"I bought this for my brother, when I received it, I was so upset. It was so small and the quality was horrible."
3,"Nice, but will foster mold.","We bought this bamboo cutting board from Target and within about six months the bottom side had mold visibly spreading just underneath/inside the surface (permeating the board). Such as it is, we'll now be investing in an Epicurean cutting board instead, which will be more sterile and maintenance free. Aside from the mold, this was a great cutting board for the short time we used it, and looks nice on a counter top. Just be sure to take special care in thoroughly air drying it after cleaning and perhaps using a special treatment to prevent the setting in of mold/bacteria. That's only my guess as to preventing this issue, though."
2,Had tiny splinters right out of the shipping box,"I read some places that when you buy cheap bamboo cutting boards that splintering can be a problem, but I didn't think it would be a concern upon receiving the item before any usage.To try and rectify the problem, I washed it thoroughly with soap and warm water, dried completely, and finished with two generous coats of bamboo oil.It seemed to diminish the amount of visible splinters, but to be fair I haven't used the cutting board since. I will give it a try with some dark-colored vegetables as a ""trial"" and see if it is good or not. Hopefully my mind will change and my rating will go up."
1,cracked and moldy,Arrived cracked and moldy. Will burn it in thefireplace.Lokks like it might have been nice if it had been in better condition.Very disappointed.
2,Lovely but fragile,"I loved this when it arrived. It's simple, lovely, easy to use. But after a few months, the light wood separated from the darker wood. The glue just doesn't hold up under moist conditions."
4,lack of quality control,"On this last order a number of bags had open, poorly sealed, broken, partial candy pieces in each individual bag. One even have 2 different flavors in one connected bag. Last time I wrote the candy company they barely responded. Unfortunately, I cannot purchase bags of Wild Cherry lifesavers, they just aren't available The only way to get bags of them is online."
5,The best of the best,Possibly the best candy I have ever had. The only drawback is I can't stop eating them.
4,Unusual and Engaging Fantasy,"This book is different than a lot of fantasy I've read. Some of the stories read like folk tales with the author's grand, old world style. I loved the imagery and vastness of the world of the Compass Rose. I was a little overwhelmed at times, but the author's choice to tell the story through separate yet intertwined tales made the book very accessible for me. Like buying a very rich, giant-size chocolate bar and being able to breaking off tiny scored bites or a huge section. Very enjoyable book! I'm glad I bought it."
5,Dreams of the Compass Rose By Vera Nazaarian,"Dreams of the Compass Rose By Vera Nazaarian Is comprised of 14 colorful dreams, spanning continents, and many generations. Each dream will stand alone but is also and interesting part of the whole. I loved this book and am so glad I had this chance to read it."
5,Dreams of the Compass Rose,"While all of the chapters can stand as stories on their own, together they build a complete, unique, and fascinating world with an unusually rich mythology and civilization. This is a fascinating read."
1,the glue bottle from hell,"Real junk! less than one hour of use, the silly plastic chain that holds the cap broke. the sponge in the base creates a mess at the nozzel that requires cleaning prior to use. the holes in the nozzel are at the end rather than on the side, thus requiring greater effort to cote the bisquit slot. No gasket or seal in the cap thus, you guessed it; the unit leaks. All of you looking at this bottle, don't buy it."
4,Not for Pros,"This poker set has 200 chips (50 each - white, yellow, red, and blue), two decks of cards and the dealer chip. The quality of the chips are the lowest you can find. But if you are not a serious poker player these chips will do fine. Have in mind this is a toy and not intended for real play. Pros must skip this set.The best feature of this set though is the zippered case. It makes it very easy to carry around. Just remember to open it the right way, other wise you will have your chips all over the place."
2,fast yet not so good,"I like the fact that it was fast on delivery, but....the cd was all scratched up...of course I new it was a used one but...it was more scratched up then anything...I could barely hear the songs..."
4,WOW,"I was amazingly suprised by this book. I know that incest is something shamed upon and is looked down on but wow, this really makes you think that although they are sibilings they still care deeply for each other. Don't take it the wrong way just because I liked the book doesn't mean I'm all for same family relationships. This book just helps you see that it could happen and does happen. Like in the book Marina tries hard to impress Lex and then one night as they got older they noticed a more intense feeling for one another. After noticing this a little while later Lex commits suicide. Mirina upset at the lost eventually finds out that Lex was adopted. You may or may not have seen that coming but if this book was a movie I think it would have been a lot easier to figure out. Over all this was a good book and I enjoyed reading it."
3,Melodramatic but Not Terrible,"Like some of Block's other work, this book's virtues include otherworldly beauty and controversial topics. Also like Block's other work, the situations have the tendency to become melodramatic.The revelation that Marina's brother, Lex, is adopted is a bit cliché. Especially after the two unfortunate lovebirds suffer so much. But like much better writers, Francesca Lia Block dives beneath the surface of every convention she creates. Sensitivity and a certain gentleness endow each character, and Block's prose, as always, give a magic quality to everyday life.It helps the drama of ""Wasteland"" immensely that the story concludes in a much more satisfying way than it begins."
1,Not Even CLOSE to a Good Read...,I didn't like this book. The author's writing style was very hard for me to follow and it was not smooth and kind of 'jumpy' in the style. I couldn't really finish reading it because I quickly lost interest.I wanted to feel for the characters but they were not appealing to me at all.Wasteland= a waste of good paper and more importantly a waste of my time.
5,The Ultimate Love Story,"I have loved all of Francesca Lia Block's books. 'Echo' and 'The Rose and The Beast' were two of my favorites, but this one undeniably tops them both. The only thing is that I wish it had a happy ending, although I understand why it couldn't then. What's the Frequency, Kenneth? I believe in Love above all things and they were obviously so much in Love. I've got my Orange Crush. What do You think?--------- X"
5,Not easy to forget,"I love books like this. It's disturbing, beautiful, and different. Most people would think that a book about incest is disgusting, but this one is touching and believable. You fall in love with the characters from the very beginning and wish that things could have been different with them. I don't like love stories all that much, but this one has a twist that is definately worth making an exception for."
1,Wastleland is where this book should go.,"If I could, I would give this novel only half a star. I've had read Block's work before and found it poor writing. I read this one because I felt it had a strong interesting topic. This book had a ton of potential to be great, but it was extremely underdeveloped. I did not know the characters at all. I did not feel sympathy for them. I did not fall in love with them. Also at times the point-of-view was confusing. I had to keep rereading to understand whose thoughts I was being thrown into.I honestly think Block had a deadline and just typed this up super fast on the computer. It doesnt seem that a lot of work had been done on this book. I dont think I'll pick up any more of Block's books. I feel I have wasted my time."
4,great for an inexpensive outdoor storage solution,"We have had two of these for 3 years each in Chicago. That's three years of Spring thunderstorms, including the one that blew our patio furniture off our rooftop deck. And three years of Chicago winters, including the blizzard of Feb 2011 that shut down the city. They are both going strong - water and snow tight. No complaints about functionality. They aren't the prettiest - just a plastic outdoor storage box - but they have done their job well for us. Highly recommended."
3,"OK, dimentions misleading","the product is solid, waterproof, and easy to assemble. my issue with it is that dimentions stated are total, outside, NOT internal storage. wanted something to store 4 seat cushions and this unit is not even close to that. will keep, because like to use as optional seat, but only can realistically store 2 cushions."
3,Good Enough but Flawed - BBQ Accessory,"I use this item with my outdoor BBQ grill. There are Pro's and Con's to this item with how I use it:PROS- Convenient rain protection for my BBQ tools and accessories (rib rack, matches, tool kit, tongs, etc)- Excellent seat for an average-sized person BBQing- Easily AssembledCONS- Warps in the sun after a few weeks of hot weather and direct sunlight (high 80's, low 90's)- Not critter tight. I discovered a spider had created a home inside it (black widow in fact - related to preference of dark spaces...?)Would I buy another piece? Yes if the application can deal with the above CONS (e.g. garden tool storage). I wouldn't use it for storing blankets or pillows for the critter factor."
4,Cushion Storage,This is the second Suncast product I have purchased. Quality is great. I bought it to store patio chair cushions and it holds the 4 cushions perfectly. I would have given it 5 stars but the lid is a bit warped and looks a bit askew.
5,Grandson loves it,"Works great for his indoor toy storage and keeps everything nice and tidy, not to mention it affords him a place to sit while reading."
2,Mostly good!,"I had higher hopes for this box and took a chance and ordered it. It did arrive quickly with all parts and instructions included. It snapped together quickly and easily, but the lid is just warped enough that it does not shut on one side. Since it is made of a hard molded plastic, it seems impossible to undo this flaw. Where I was going to put it on the patio shows the flaw very clearly. Needless to say, it is now shoved off into a corner where it is not seen, and less than useful. Too much hassle to return, so I'll live and learn on this one."
2,Poor Marketing,"I wanted white which was a few dollars more. Purchased, and quess what? 'the brown was delivered, I'll hate it forever but I didn't have enough time to return. Item is sturdy, a bit hard to assemble but seems to be a good sturdy item."
5,Great storage box,"I bought this box to store clipping shears, extension cord, and other misc items I did not want to leave out on my patio.I was worried that it would not be water-proof, but after several weeks of rain here in Southern California (I know...shocking for Southern Ca), items inside of stayed dry. This storage unit is attractive and quite durable!"
3,Works,"Not bad. Very easy to assemble. We use this by the kids swingset to store some rags and other misc items to clean away spiderwebs and such. It does not seal very well, however. Every time we open it up there are always spiders and crickets inside."
4,"Good value, a bit smaller than anticipated.","It is built sturdily enough... just a lot smaller than I had anticipated... my own fault. Buy it if you need some storage on the porch area... and anticipate it looking plasticy and just ""so-so""."
4,Just right porch storage seat,"After looking for quite a while I decided on this storage seat because it was waterproof (yep, it is) and allowed a place to put on and take off shoes at the front porch of my home. It works well, even with large family members, who feel quite secure on this seat. Assembled very easily."
5,great product for price paid,VERY easy to put together. easy to use. light weight yet sturdy. just what i wanted and happy with the price.
4,STORAGE SEAT,"I wanted a small storage box for my deck. I went to all the area stores, but all they had were big boxes. I decided to try on line. I am very happy with this box. It's a perfect size for our deck and the color is perfect."
2,Don't use for bird seed,"I have had these for a year and have used them to store bird seed for my feeders. The squirrels have completely ruined them both - a costly mistake for me. They have managed to chew holes in them - they are plastic and not as tough as one would have hoped. For anything else, I suppose they will be ok, but just beware if you are looking for secure storage."
3,Color Hard to tell,"The product is functional and easy to assemble. However, from looking at the picture, I expected it to be white or cream and there is nothing in the description telling a color. It is grey. I would recommend adding the statement color - light grey. Fortunately in my application grey was ok. Otherwise I would have been returning it."
1,Impossible to complete assembly,"It works fine up until step 6 in the instructions, when the final thing to do is snap the lid onto the hinges. They say ""bend the left hinge tab"" to make it snap into place. No can do - I tried a number of different tools and the plastic is too rigid to bend. It would have been better to have a lift-off lid than to have a lid that requires these hinges that can't be fit together. I may end up sawing off the pins for the hinges to turn this into a lift off lid. Apart from that, the appearance and size are nice, and the assembly was easy until I got to the hinges."
2,Doesn't Weather Well,"I left this outside for a couple of seasons. The color faded and the plastic panels warped slightly (although everything still works).To be fair, I live in Michigan, and maybe it just wasn't designed for my climate. I'm sure it works great poolside.Heads up for the cold weather folks, though!"
4,storage seat,Adequate quality. Easy to put together. Unobtrusive. Using it to store pool chemicals. Since it has no metal the chlorine and acid fumes will not disturbe it. This came as a free-be with the larger storage seat and it was perfect for us since the other pool toys and supplies don't have to be in contact with the chemicals.
3,Surprise upon delivery,"When I received theSuncast SS1000 Storage SeatI was unpleasantly surprised to see that the dimensions on the box did not match the dimensions on the Website. The site says ""Measures 24 by 22 by 17 inches (W x D x H)"" but the box says 22 by 17 by 22 inches (W x D x H), and these are outside dimensions. The unfortunate part is that I need the 22 inch depth in order to hold my 18 inch wide swimming pool cleaner and the SS1000 was the only one I found. I suppose I should have been suspicious. Hopefully the web site will be updated."
5,Good visors,"Great service from the vendor, sent by mail quickly. The black material on bottom side of visor should be white, especially for wearing in Arizona. Otherwise I'm very pleased."
1,No Headache Midsize Purple Visor,"The mid-size is actually quite large. Had I to do it over again, I would just get the original size because that would be sufficient. I like a bit of sun but just not in my eyes! I found that when wearing it in a boat with the wind at my face as we traveled, it stayed on very well. That was a concern that I had since many visors flip off in heavy wind currents. I did get a slight headache from it but not as bad as other visors. The visor part seems to be a hard plastic with a light cloth material covering. I chose purple and it is a beautiful shade. The bows that go around your head are made of some soft comfortable material and they go farther around your head than other standard visors."
3,Good Visor,Is a good Visor but doesn't cover my face how I wanted and is a little big for me so I gave to my aunty wich was happy!!The shipping was ok!!
4,adds a little extra,"Phoebe, Robin, and Teal - who are they? They are the three main characters of the new novel Midnight Flight, the second book of the Broken Wing series written by V. C. Andrews. This book follows the same pattern of the V.C. Andrews novels, but adds a little extra to lead the reader in. I like this book. It was a very different setting that hasn't been covered by any others books I've read. Also, this book talks about rehabilitation of mental and psychological states, which is one reason the girls get sent to Dr. Forman's School for Girls. This is the school nobody would every want to be sent to. No other school is quite like it. For one thing, it's in the desert where there's not anyone else for miles. Also, this is a place where the girls have to do very outlandish things. What are the girls to do? Do they really have a choice? I enjoyed the descriptions and wording throughout the book."
4,Good read for troubled teens,"If you are a parent of a troubled teen this series is a good one for them to read. Having a 16 year old daughter who was getting into trouble all the time, our family was thinking of putting her in a home because we couldn't handle her anymore. After she read this series she's come to realize that ""the grass is not always greener on the other side."""
1,Twisted male fantasy?,"I can sum this book up in one word: Ewwww. It read like some sort of demented, (...) fantasy. I don't know about the rest of you but this sort of twisted tale doesn't appeal to me now and wouldn't have appealed to me as a teen and I read and enjoyed some weird things. I read most of the early VC Andrews novels and enjoyed them through and through even when they started to become repetive but, sadly, I couldn't bring myself to finish this one. The story is thoroughly unappealing on all levels. Where shall I begin? The child-like writing? The unlikable and unrealistic teens? The forced diaper wearing? The information dumps that defy all logic? Need I continue? I think not . ."
2,Disappointment,"I was disappointed by this current novel. I think the plots are catered to a very young crowd...I prefer the more ""mature"" versions of the previous books which were in a series with one main character.My other favorite author, Sherry A Mauro writes in the grand traditon of the ""Andrews Gothic"". Her new novel, Even Angels Fall will delight VC Andrews fans of all ages. I highly recommend her book!"
2,GhostWriter: Andrew Niederman,"The GW Andrew Niederman is not worthy of the VC Andrews name. The family of VCA should re-think the writer and find a better one. This book bit the big one as did the former. I hope and pray that the new Gemini series is worthy of my time and money. As far as the Borken Wings series, I want my money back."
5,Best VCA book yet,"It's been awhile since I read Midnight Flight, but I still remember the profound feeling of satisfaction I felt while reading it and even after. In agreement with those who've said it's different than any of the previous works, that is the absolute truth.Midnight Flight was such a breath of fresh air and deviated far from the formulaic 'vulnerable-girl-meets-boy-they-have-sex-and-oh-yeah-other-things-happen-in-her-life' arrangement that we've become familiar with in most other VCA books.I could not put this book down; the story is just so riveting! The descriptions of the 'buddies' and their actions were beyond anything my imagination could ever fathom. The suspense in this book was tremendous and enjoyable. I wish I was a slower reader so that I could have taken more than one night to read it, but in the end, the price of the book and the bags under my eyes the next day were well worth it.More writings like this would be a welcome change, at least in my opinion."
2,Stop the abuse!,"This is shameful. Poor V.C., rolling around in her grave as I write this. Why does the G.W. insist on driving her good name through the mud? I never even finished Broken Wings, and this one just tops off the true V.C. genius abuse. I find this writing too predictable, following a ""formula"" that is now way overdone. The characters are sketchy, black-and-white, and I feel nothing but anger and frusteration towards them. These are just clones of previous characters already written, topped off with similar names and plots. The cliches are beginning to drive me mad, and I wonder time and time again why I keep coming back for more. Perhaps it's the G.W.'s promises of ""something never seen before,"" but, honestly, when will I learn?"
1,VERY SADISTIC!!!!!!!,"This is the absolute worst book I have ever read!!! Who ever this ghost writer that is writing for V.C. Andrews is a total freak!! These books just keep getting worse and worse!! I will not waste my money on another book written under V.C. Andrews' name.I admit I did finish reading this book, only because I thought it would get better. I mean, how could it get worse!! The things that Dr. Foreman did to these girls were so freaky and off the wall. This story sort of resembled ""Holes"", but the girls were treated far worse than the boys in that book.I also admit, I cheered at the end!!!! Everyone got what they deserved, except for Posy!!"
1,Flight Cancelled!,That's it. I stopped on pg 168 after I read some of these reviews. My time is more valuable than to spend it reading a worthless book that has no redeeming qualities. What segment of the reading public are these geared for?Not me that is for sure.
3,Good Read?,"Don't remember getting this book must havve been a gift for my Mother in Law, she deserves it since she is a wonderful lady,"
3,"some great songs, but not a whole lot of variety","First, you'll notice there are few men on this album (Angie Aparo is a guy, by the way). Partly for this reason, this album is a little weak in variety. Many of the songs are ho-hum.BUT there are several outstanding songs to note. The much-played Here With Me by Dido is a great song, despite its heavy rotation. Silence by Delerium with Sarah McLachlan is one of my favorites ever. It's an ethereal, haunting masterpiece and any fan of Sarah Mc needs to own it. Never Gonna Come Back Down by BT is a goofy, thumping, techno/dance tune with a catchy chorus and a welcome chnage of pace.But the standout to me is Angie Aparo's Hush. I don't know anything about him, but this song is awesome. It's an emotional rocker with definite pop sensibility and a brilliant chorus.SO, overall, like most soundtracks, you'll enjoy half the songs and probably skip the rest. Unless you just LOVE Leigh Nash."
4,one of the better soundtracks,"Fans of Sixpence None the Richer are in for a treat. The opening song, done by Leigh Nash (of Sixpence) is probably the strongest song on the disc. The remix of the song ""Love"" is superior to the album release, with heavier guitars and a more engaging beat. The other songs featured are suprisingly good, even though most people probably arent familiar with these artists.(Although the BT track is truly awful) A worthy purchase for fans of the movie and pop music in general. Well, actually I have no desire to see the movie, I just bought this for the Leigh Nash song.Top Tracks of the album:1. Need to be Next To You ~ Leigh Nash2. Love ~ Sixpence None the Richer3. Lose Your Way ~ Sophie B. Hawkins4. Hush ~ Angie Aparo5. Divided ~ Tara MacLean"
4,wonderful collection of music!,"Usually on a soundtrack you don't expect more than two songs all together to be good. Three, maybe. This album has one good song after the next. O.K., I admit, I'm not crazy about one or two of them. Maybe three. But overral, you will really enjoy this collection of music. It played in my cd player for quite some time, and I still like to pop it in now and then as a treat to my ears. Buy it and enjoy!"
4,Great gift for the strategy card game fan in your life.,"I bought this for a friend who loves strategy card games. He loved it! If you know someone who has a twisted sense of humor and strategy games, I would highly recommend this game."
3,Not Satisfied with Product,"I've been a loyal Apple user for at least ten years. I am a Network Admin for a IT consultant company and have been using Windows Server 2k through 2008.I've never had so many problems setting up a server besides any 2008 box. I was hoping that using a older software would mean more stability, but that was not the case for me during the install.Once I had everything up and running how I wanted too, it does seem more stable.There is little to no support for the issues I had, but was able to figure them out.I do not recommend using OS X if you have a short install time."
5,Life saver!,These have been a life saver. I tried another product that was triple the price last pregnancy and they were so stiff and uncomfortable. I am so happy with these at the 20-30 compression and a size larger since I have very large thighs. I am in the process of ordering several more pairs since my veins are so bad that I can even get out of bed without them!
3,Okay but not great,"I am somewhat pleased with the strength and help I have gotten from these stockings. I am expecting my third child and I am having problems with my veins. Be very careful about how you put them on, I was actually trying to pull them up higher on my thighs today and put a snag in them. Overall for the price you can't beat it, since most run in the hundreds if you try to get them at a medical store."
3,Sturdy and uncomfortable,"Pros:-really make me appreciate my $124 hose from Sigvaris-so sturdy they'll probably outlast Sigvaris hoseCons:-compression ends abruptly about an inch below the crotch-feel like a tourniquet at times while being put on-quickly become uncomfortable as they start sliding down. I am 5'6'', 115 pounds pre-pregnancy, and bought medium. My legs are not short, but if I pull them up as hard as I can, they make a band around the top of my thigh. If I don't pull them up so hard, they make an even more uncomfortable band around my knee. I wonder if a small would have been better, but I cringe to think how tight the temporary tourniquets would be as a size small is put on.Overall: I still haven't decided if it's more painful to pay $124 for hose that fits, or to wear these things all day--they do the job after all, and help my varicose veins not ache, so maybe they're worth the discomfort."
4,Work great!,These work great and have really helped the veracious viens on my upper inner thigh. My only complaint is that the area around the ball of my foot is a bit too tight (and I have narrow feet). But the belly part does come up just right and has aloud for a growing belly quite nicely.
5,Very sturdy and do the job well,"Ordered this product to help me get through leg pain in the second trimester. This is my second pregnancy and I started to develop painful varicose veins on my leg. With this product, I don't even feel any pain throughout the whole day. I have tried lesser compression (10-15) by Preggers but they were not strong enough for me, my legs still hurt. With these compression stockings, I feel great. And they are also sturdy as the other reviewers indicated so I am not afraid of any runs. Overall, they do the job very well. They are of course very tight and like any compression stockings, are not something I would choose to wear for fun but they work and do what they are supposed to do. Overall,I would recommend to others."
5,"my favorite book, ever!","hey, review the book, but don't give the whole story away!(:I haven't found a book that moves me more, that shows God's love for all~walked out here on earth, through true servants of God!Amazing!!"
3,Good social history,"I would have said this is engaging, nicely done historical fiction; however, it turns out there is no Cypress Parish, and it is not clear from the afterword whether the diversion of flooding victimized some other parish. It is good social history, and there are many good characters, but they are not deeply drawn.For a really well written novel with an engaging teenage protagonist, set in a small Canadian town during the 1930's, I would recommend ""The Other Side of the Bridge"" by Mary Lawson."
2,"...uh huh, and so?","I'll let the author write the review (p.755-756 in my copy) ""...as one reads along, one becomes more and more suspicious that the author has lost the thread of his argument...that the position of the characters will have so changed y the book's end that the answers to the initial questions will have become trivial."" Kind of a shame though, because the Kid character is rather interesting of himself...but in the end, we go nowhere, we get nowhere, and we're left suspecting that the author is pulling a big hoax on us...creating a totally meaningless whole from the sum of a bunch of trivial parts. I have to wonder why this book is considered brilliant and important, when in the end all I can say after reading 801 pages of this is, ""...yeah, and so what?"""
1,The Worst Novel in the English Language,"...or perhaps even any human language. Never has the mind of man conceived of such a self-indulgent exercise in deliberate obscurity, empty artifice and lexorhea. SPOILER: Its a book about itself. The book. A literal literary circle j@rk. Ooooooooo so deep and worthwhile - NOT.I love novels. I love the evolving form of the novel, from Swift and Defoe through Austen, Scott, Dickens, Twain, Wells, Hemingway, Joyce, Faulkner, Burroughs, Brunner and beyond. This is a crime against the concept of the novel. It is abomination.I burned my copy. That does not make me a book-burner, Delaney's monster doesn't count. Sometimes I wake up at night in a sweat, shaking in horror remembering this un-book. I wish I could burn the memory of it out of my brain. Burning my copy will have to do."
1,They killed a tree for this?,"I have read thousands of books in my life, and have only returned four to the shelf unfinished - Dhalgren being among them. Am I missing something? As I read the book I would of course ask questions: What is the nature of this disaster? Why is the sun swollen? Why the two moons? Why does the city burn without being consumed? Why would someone go there? Why would anyone stay? Is there an advantage to living in such a place? Where did the holograms come from and what is their significance? Why is the rest of the world ignoring such an unusual phenomenon? By page three hundred none of these questions had even been touched upon. I had to give up on a story which was little more than the chronicaling of the day-to-day routine of perverted losers who choose to dwell(why?)in a destroyed (why?) city."
1,An incredible piece of Dreck.,"This has been one of the most unintelligable pieces of sci-fi written, As a flight of fancy that builds and extropolates on where science may take us, it is totally lacking. As a universe of its own merit from which to examine issues that pertain to life and how we live or the choices we have before us as a society, again lacking. An immense waste of time, money and energy. It made me question only the taste of the person who recomended this dreck."
5,Take a mythical journey to the lost city of Bellona.,"Few books are able to capture the essence of a time, a place, a way of life, the waythis book captures the wild turbulence of the 60's. Delany has created not so much a story as a living microcosm that changes and develops as it unfolds. The mythical city of Bellona is a metaphor for the revolutions going on all around the world. After reading, one feels as if he/she has experienced the golden era, without any of the opinionated editorialism and sensationalsim that comes with the media. This science fiction classic is as pertinent today as it was when it was written. I find myself going back and reading bits of past dialogue and always finding a new insight. After you read it once you'll find yourself drawn back into that mysterious world; and, like the tragic hero of the story, if you're careful, you'll return with something more valuable than what you took with you."
2,Buyer Beware,A word of caution to science fiction fans. Though the premise of this novel would appeal to any science fiction buff the book contains the authors personal exploration of his own homesexual character. Though I have nothing against the author for this exploration I would prefer not to be included in this journey and would have appreciated some forewarning of the true nature of the book. I prefer my science fiction to be about science fiction and not alternate lifestyles. Buyer beware.PS. For some reason 2 stars appear for my rating of this book when I wouldn't even give it 1.
3,3.5 Stars,"This is one of those books that should be read for the experience but I have to admit it's far from my favorite science fiction narrative. It starts out quite encouragingly but then gets bogged down in repetition. Violence, sexuality of all kinds, depravity, dirt, grime, and gore are all part of life, particularly when living in chaotic circumstances, but Delany seems transfixed by these aspects of life and replays the same basic scenes too many times within the covers of one book. While he does delve successfully into the human psyche and provides a very realistic picture of human reactions to extraordinary circumstances overall I think he could have cut quite a few pages out and had a better book for it."
3,A masterpiece without time or space,"A masterpiece without time or space, broad as the earth itself... but not to my taste. Storytelling without climax; no crests or troughs; solid 800+ pages of life without temporal or spacial consistency. It's an odd and inspirational one: if this was written, published and well-liked then it may just be possible for anyone to do the same!Parts of the book were readable, very readable as a matter of fact. I naive though in trying to pin down the time and place, but proved to be a unfruitful mind exercise. Best I could could do was (time- about 1980) and (place- around Ohio). Perhaps these questions were meant not to be answered, but it's human nature to try to make sense of things... and that is where many people see the fallacy in Dhalgren: it can't be applied to us."
5,The only book I could read again and again...,I am 34 years of age.I first read Dhalgren when I was about 13 and even today images of the one-sandaled man stay with me. Try to remember the feeling of wearing only one shoe or sandal at a time? It feels awkward doesn't it? This novel is a story of our awkward humanity; of nature/culture; and the sometimes terrible price we pay to 'socialize' our citizens.To Delaney I send my deepest thanks for one novel that reflects what it is to be an imperfect soul in an imperfect world.
3,It reads better with a head full of weed.,"I read this book in 1975 when I was on the road with a band and I could relate to the unsettled and confusing plot and situations of the denizens of Bellona as an analogue for my own lifestyle at the time. While I don't remember the book in it's entirety (and I can't be sure that I even finished it), it made enough of an impression upon me and may have even corrupted my moral and spiritual reasoning in some subtle way. I don't expect that I will read it again (life is too short to delve into fat paperbacks more than once after the age of 40) so my memories of the book are perhaps more fond than if I had just lately shelled out 6 or 7 dollars for the thing and found it wanting. It was also some of the first gay erotic writing I ever encountered, which also piqued my interest. I had fun reading it, though I'm not sure anyone under 45 would these days."
2,Hype,"I don't mind a challenging book, but I need to get something, anything from the excertion and after 450 pages, ""Dhalgren"" didn't budge. More than anything at that point, it is only science fiction because of the 70's porno amount of sex Kidd engages in. I didn't feel any closer to understanding him, (its annoying to have a ""nameless"" character for too long, even if great writer's like Kafka did it) or much of the novel. Its a subtle science fiction, no spaces ships or laser guns. Even as frustrating as the first half was for me, I do hope to go back and try to finish it, because so many other reviewers got something out of it but I had to pull myself to a less tedious book for now. I liked Delany's juxtaposition of third person with first person stream of consciousness, it worked well even if it is underused."
1,"On a Ten Point Scale, this is the only book I give a Zero.","When I was a kid, I saw a fat ancient copy of Dhalgren sitting on a sheld at the library and I said to myself, ""Someday I'm going to read that."" Over five years later I bought a copy and it turned out the be the most colossal waste of time ever. It's not just a waste of time; it actively ruins the time it takes to read. It's 800 pages long and there's not a single idea of any sort in it. This book does not have a single redeeming feature; Delany's style is pretentious and his overuse of ellipsis mechanical. I would give Dhalgren no stars if I could (a black dot) but I can't."
1,Impenetreble Fortress take two,I have to agree with the reviews that indicate this book is not worth the effort. Do not bother wasting your time trying to read this book period. I like Delanys work but this was a failed attempt.
1,i actually threw this book across the room,"never have i loathed a book as much as this book. when i had to read the abomination ""The Scarlet Letter"" as a kid I thought it couldn't possibly be worse then two page sentences and entire paragraphs describing a bush. I WAS WRONG!!I absolutely hated this book and I made it until the pages went wonky and then I just go so mad I threw it across the room, then in the trash- something i have never done before."
2,Belodona; what a gas!,"the novel ?? is dhalarghen A BIGONE.a BOGUS dslyctic cypher dicifer decibal DROLL thriLL RIDE /afflictioon/dicktion during nixon; drifter [its very earthy early seventies soaked]It takes place somewhere/anywhere after MANSON KILLED OFF THE HIPPIES .The book opens with images of astronauts clocks and broken glass, its alot of smoke and mirrors spit and spat out punying it overwrought self into bemusement indeed. INTO the zoo, into oz into the KIDDS OR IS IT THE kid,[ PSYCEDELIC popsicle fragment] MIND must i be kidding [pastche pasted floral wasted fragmented psyche] we go.LIKE a mundane watching of existence like a seventies made for television rerun running endless EYES sewn wide open with no blinks permited so Delanys plague journal explains reading can be writing. so it goes on and on ..carening indeed bologna"
3,"Too easy, but great for beginners.","Liz Gillies is as sweet as she can be, however, I don't enjoy the workout so much. It does work you out, but it is extremely easy on the toning. I don't feel much - and I've been doing ball workouts for a while. It's great for getting into pilates and just beginning on the ball."
3,Not for beginners,"Wow, I must be really out of shape compared to the other reviews! I found this tape to be really really difficult for a beginner :( But it was still fun to try!"
3,Book is Good. The copy I got from the seller (Amazon Marketplace) was not,"Nice overview of building some sheds etc.+ Easy, pretty good examples, nice detail in some projects- choppy, some structures are very ornate, some would be $$$$$$ todayI would have like more info on the finer details, like flashing, door and window fitting, etc.I'll try to write a separate review of the seller. The bottom line is the copy I received reeked of cigarette smoke. Not just a little smell. It reeked. Like, stick it outside on the deck and find a way to open most of the pages for days stink. Like, use a deodorizer stink.If you're a contractor, or do regular projects, this may be too basic. If you can swing a hammer and use a saw, this ought to be ok."
3,informative,"ok well apparantly the first feedback i left was a neutral feedback. my mistake. This book may be small but its very informative, some of the E.O's are hard to come by or even hard to find, but i found the recipes to be very useful, there are a few that i am going to try out. I recieved the book well within the date it was supposed to arrive very fast delivery."
1,Failed after six months,Wheel bearings should last longer than six months. I will not be doing a warranty return because poor quality bearings can cause an accident.
4,Withstands the test of time,"This music sounds as fresh and appealing as it did when first issued during the 1970s (except for the Widescreen album, which is more recent and stylistically different although also very good). Carmen were a unique band who performed a sub-genre of prog rock that very effectively incorporated the Flamenco sound. If you're not familiar with this music, it may require several listenings before the songs seem to ""hang together"" as coherent pieces of music, due to the frequent sudden and dramatic changes; however, it is worth sticking with it because once your brain ""gets it,"" you will be able to enjoy many, many repeated listenings without ever becoming bored."
5,queen of the nile by CLEOPATRA,my name is lousie iaam 10 years old my gig sister bout me the album of cleopatra queen of the nile for chrismas and i aam very happy with my cd it was the best music that ive list to so far NUMBER 1
3,Love Shakti Gawain,"It's a good CD,b ut there is too much side talk. I didn't realize it was a recorded live presentation. I much prefer her Creative Visualization CD which is excellent. If you do the meditation/visualization consistently you CAN manifest things into your life!"
5,Hedwig is ten years old and still rocking!,"One of the best rock musicals ever produced! Hedwig's still got it after all these years: this film version, starring and directed by and its co-author John Cameron Mitchell, is as relevant, funny and poignant today as when it was first presented off broadway in 1998. This is a sublime work of art, not to be missed."
5,Hedwig and the Angry Inch,"This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. I actually rented it and kept it for a week and kept watching it over and over again and finally realised I had to buy it! I've had it for a couple of weeks now and have probably seen it another dozen times. The actor John Cameron Mitchell who plays Hedwig is AMAZING!!! He wrote the songs, sings the songs, directed the film and came up with the original idea of Hedwig. WOW!!! There is something special about this movie-it's like a drug. The songs are catchy and Mitchell has a beautiful voice. I would describe it as an adult, alternative musical/movie. For me, it's sitting right up there with my Sound of Music dvd...I love it THAT much!!!"
4,A--uhm--memorable love story,"""Hedwig and the Angry Inch"" is not a typical love story.It is a Boy-Failed-To-Turn-Girl falling into, out of, and into love with a Confused-Boy-Who-Stayed-Boy love story (And, of course, there is additional drama added by the complex feelings of Gay-Exhausted-Artist-Turned-Transvestite.) But though the story is made strange, the emotion is familar: love, true love, deep love; convincingly, compellingly portrayed.It is often moving; slyly (sometimes rudely) funny. And, of course, the music rocks."
5,Beautiful and sad,I thoroughly enjoyed this story. I wanted to crawl into its world and just stay there forever.
2,disappointing,"Although sometimes very entertaining (e.g., Hansel's dance scene), behind the flashy exterior is a lot of sentimental nonsense. The songs are mostly uninteresting, the lyrics are mostly embarrassing, and the film's philosophy is almost entirely juvenile. The end of the film flails toward something interesting, but fails. A lot of people have enjoyed this movie, and many more will also enjoy it -- but if you're thinking of going, know what you're in for. Colorful it may be; meaningful it is not."
1,Delivery?,I'm sure the product is great but it was never delivered. The delivery address is correct and the delivery status says that is was delivered on December 2nd. It's January 5th and I have yet to see it. Because it was already recorded as delivered I do not know what can be done. Is it possible to see the delivery signature to see if it is anyone's I would recognize?
1,WORST MOVIE EVER!,"This movie was the biggest waste of money! I actually threw my copy away. Seriously, don't waste your time and money! It's not worth it!!!"
1,I have never wanted to beat a director and writer this much!,"This is, without a doubt, the worst movie I have ever seen. Aside from lacking completely in worthwhile dialogue and storyline, this movie is blunt and disturbing for the sheer sake of it! I don't understand why this movie ever go past step pre-production. Unless you feel the need to be horribly repulsed and to enjoy pissing away your money, do not even consider this horrible excuse for a movie!"
5,A hero for the outcasts!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Order this now!!!...What a fun, crazy, original, funny, touching and rockin' movie. I have such a huge crush on Hedwig mainly because of his huge heart. This will remain on my midnight movie list forever. (Having said that, I didn't like the last 10 minutes of the film. It could have been cut.) But so what, the rest of this wild rock and roll ride will have you head banging and lanughing out loud. Order the soundtrack too. Long live Hedwig!!!..."
3,Deliciously tacky,"Deliciously tacky movie version of John Cameron Mitchell&#65533;s brilliant Broadway show isn&#65533;t pulled off as easily on film, as it gets a bit too excessive in its last third, but its lead is such a dynamic star that it is worth a good look. Telling the story of an &#65533;internationally ignored&#65533; rock star transsexual who, following a botched sex-change operation, now has the &#65533;angry inch&#65533; of the title, Mitchell as director uses too many silly animated sequences to tell the charming story of how Hedwig travelled from East Berlin to America only to have all her songs stolen from her by her once best friend Tommy Gnosis, a teenager who is now an international rock star. The highlight of the film, and the mainly memorable aspect of it, is the fantastic collection of songs written by Stephen Trask, that are all toe-tapping and will stay in your head for days."
3,Art for Art's Sake?,"""Hedwig and the Angry Inch"" defies description. It is a rock musical about glamrocker Hedwig, who used to be Hansel, from East Germany. Hedwig goes through a series of bizarre adventures and ends up a star with the band The Angry Inch. Fun and dazzling visuals, but hard to follow and jumbled in places, the film tries to be art, heavy on symbols and irony, but doesn't quite succeed. Worth a look, but could be better."
2,This is just too weird,"Despite the brilliant performance by John Cameron Mitchell, this film is just not all that great. It is visually bizarre, the animation is very simplistic looking but makes very strange conotations as they do apply to the story.I watched this purely to see Mitchell's performance. I had heard it was utterly amazingly brilliant, and I totally agree. This film is just too out there for me. I've appreciated movies about drag queens and gay men in the past so that has nothing to do with my decisions here. Some of it just made no sense to me. This movie is just not for everyone.I did like the music a lot, it was very original and fresh. It helped to tell the story somewhat, but I didn't think the story had much of a finish..."
2,online?,Horrible on line version. Buy it from some where else. Sucks so bad. Netflix probably has it better. Sucks! Sucks Sucks Sucks Sucks Sucks Sucks Sucks Sucks Sucks Sucks Sucks Sucks Sucks Sucks Sucks
5,More than I expected,"When I first saw this I was told it was just like Rocky Horror, and hearing this from people equally obsessed wtih Rocky Horror, i knew it had to be true. But no! They lied! This is even BETTER than rocky horror.Not only is the music great and fun and hysterical, but the story actually has purpose too, I even caught myself crying a few times. Mostly laughing though...this is definitely one of my new favorites, you definitely want to see this"
5,"Bitter, Angry, and Vindictive...","Hedwig, a transsexual, is the lead singer for the band Hedwig and the Angry Inch and she got double-crossed by her former lover who is now a big time rock star. She is bitter, angry, vindictive, and ready to take on the past in order to settle old scores. One outlet is her music and it takes shape in many different forms throughout the film. However, her anger is hard to direct, since she cannot confront her targets. Hedwig's story is displayed through an abstract, surrealistic, and musical design that brings across the idea of Hedwig's problems in a multifaceted manner. The result is a smart film that is a brilliant cinematic experience."
5,Hedwig rocks!,I bought the DVD because I was going to see a theatre performance with 12 Hedwigs! Crazy! Loved both the movie and the live performance. Wish I had seen the original Off-Broadway version! So glad I watched the movie with original Hedwig and creative team before seeing the adventure with 12 Hedwigs! Bravo to all!
5,Best musical-to-film translation EVER,"Hedwig was one of my favorite musicals before i knew about the movie. I never go into a musical-turned-movie expecting much because it's impossible to recreate the feeling of seeing it live. Hedwig can't either, but it comes THIS close *imagine me holding my fingers REALLY close together* Amazing movie, you laugh, you cry, it's ALL there. if you're a modern, non-traditional musical fan, buy this movie! It's a necessity for any musical lover's collection!"
5,Mind-Altering Viewpoint,"First time I watched this movie I was kinda confused, but felt like I'd just been run over by a truck. Still, I came back a second time, and a third, and a fourth...And each time it amazes me. The meaning behind this movie and the idea of what makes someone happy might not end up completing them in the long run. *sigh* How many people can this touch before it becomes a cult classic?Oh wait, It already is! :)"
4,hedwig & the angry inch,"The main reviewer appears to be stuck in the 1950's, as this movie is actually very cleverly done. Granted there are some lapses in flow, the story really sucks you in and Mitchell is indeed a very dynamic performer. I saw this not expecting a whole lot, and was totally blown away. Great movie!"
4,"I EXPECTED TO WALK OUT ON THIS ONE, BUUUT!!","Say, what!! An angry inch indeed. This movie will become a cult flick along with 'Rocky Horror' and a few others. Cameron was devastating as Hedwig, and the rest of the crew were great. Really liked the songs, but couldn't quite get all the words. As it took my concentration away from the screen.Parts of the jerking gyrations in some of the stage numbers reminded me of some fast-moving-numbers in Moulin Rouge. I will have to rent it and or buy it to really be able to get those words right. As it was;I was the only one in the theater who was laughing out loud. Or maybe I couldnt hear the others above my own...the colors were vivid and if u can see it in an auditorium type theater and sit up in the back..to be able to take it all in. I gave this a ****star rating.ciao:yaaah69"
5,5 happy inches back,"Sad yet enthralling rock opera. Campy and fun while chronicling the life of a MTF with big dreams, the injustices he faced and the music that is his life."
5,"wonderful, and beautiful.","I've read some reviews where people just didn't understand, and I can understand some of that. It's a story about a world far from our own, and that's why i think it's so amazing. Hedwig is an amazing person, and I found this movie hysterical and touching.If you are one for indie, documentary-like films then you should see this! The music is amazing, and 'midnight radio' is now a top fav of mine. I think this movie is loved by a select crowd, but still should been seen by everyone.However I don't think I'd watch this with my parents, lol. Some parts of the movie are odd, nothing wrong with the scenes...just culturally odd. :/for example, the gummy bear scene. Yet I still loved every minute of it.Hope all of you will enjoy the movie :)"
5,Brilliant,"This movie is absolutely brilliant. John Cameron Mitchell is a legend and true artist of our time. Not only did he write and direct this movie, he also stars as a stunning Hedwig. After watching the behind the scenes documentary, that is also included with the dvd, you learn a lot of the main players from the first ever stage performance of Hewig are in the cast. The guitarist in the movie is actually songwriter for the musical book of the play, Stephen Trask. John Cameron Mitchell wrote the original book and screenplay. Their genius is breathtaking. You'll laugh, you'll cry, and you'll want to hug John Cameron Mitchell for being so awesome. And high five him. Truly a great piece of artistic beauty."
4,"Not much story, but great soundtrack","I'm giving this four stars for John Cameron Mitchell, the graphic and animation, the excellent soundtrack, and the overall idea.I'm leaving out one star because there wasn't really that much to the story.If the lack of plot doesn't bother you too much, you will probably enjoy the story of the East German wanna-be transsexual Hedwig, the band, the dreary tour of Bilgewater restaurants in the U.S., and the love/hate affair with Tommy Gnosis, who was Hedwig's lover until he stole the latter's songs for his own album and took all the credit."
5,Hedwig: My oh my.,"There are a very few films that I actually RESPECT and Hedwig and the Angry Inch is one of them. For my money, this film is as good a musical as Bob Fosse's ""All that Jazz"" and ""Cabaret."" It is a film that changes the viewers perception of the world and it delivers maximum entertainment without putting a step wrong.The DVD is nothing short of brilliant, containing a 1.5 hour doco on the making, deleted scenes (some of them very funny) and other features.This is one of the best films AND one of the best DVD releases I have ever seen. 10/10"
1,Buyer beware !,"This is an import and does not play in most all American DVD players, so buyer beware, don't buy it!"
4,Red Majesty,"Red glitter lips never looked so defiantly good as when Hedwig bursts in and starts roaring her anthem. Like a caped crusader wrapped up in the American Flag, she is her own hero. She wears her wigs and makeup like a 1980's rock star who knows what it means to have to fight to make her voice heard. Hedwig capitulates the very essence of rock and roll into the less frequented venues for such finery with as much tranny flair as humanly possible.Hedwig's one goal is to be a star and on her journey she creates one through Tommy Gnosis. The sweet seeming Christian boy who steals her heart and her songs leaves her performing in random restaurants where the majority of customers look bored or even disgusted by her presence. For them, Hedwig is someone they endure. They can't relate to the pain six inches forward and five inches back creates in a person. Nevertheless, Hedwig insists they witness, listen and look at someone society often shuns."
5,awesome,Great in every possible way. It's one of the best movies ever and I highly recommend it. Can't watch it enough.
5,Fun movie with deep impressions and great bonus features,"I learned about the stage production when it opened in NYC years ago and thought often about it since. When I saw the movie, I had to have it. It's better than I thought it could be. Additionally, the DVD has lots of bonus material, including an 80 minute feature on the show."
5,"""The strangest things seem suddenly routine...""","A mutilated cross-dressing East-German gets shafted by his collaborator/lover and embarks on a journey to get his own back. There, now that the plot is out of the way, what about the movie? John Cameron Mitchell wrote, directed and starred in the original role (as well as the movie version), which was little more than a set at a drag club. From there, it became an off-Broadway show, an album, and now, a truly amazing film. While Mitchell's script is ironic and detatched (albeit very clever), his performance brings a very real pain to the role that keeps it from becoming self-indulgent. The songs here are fabulous, one of the highlights being ""A Wig in a Box,"" which ends with a sing-along. The production values are amazing throughout the film; this does not feel like a first film made on a shoestring, though it surely is that. The DVD has an EXTREMELY thourough documentary, links to the songs, and assorted other goodies. A great purchase."
4,"Entertaining, and even a little thought-provoking","This is a really good film. The performances are right on - John Cameron Mitchell has tons of personality and great comic timing. The music is part Iggy Pop, part Rocky Horror, part Meatloaf... interesting and definitely catchy. My only quibble is that there are a lot of interesting side characters who don't get developed - the Yitzhak character and the whole rest of the band - there are teeny references to their story but my impression is that there was a lot of interesting stuff that got left out in the editing process. There are also lots of fun throwaway sight gags. Put me down for a pre-order on the DVD..."
5,Great,This movie wonderfully great from beginning to end. The dialogue is hilarious and the same time makes you think. Esspecially when Hedwig explains his view on the orgin of love. The music is catchy and gets stuck in your head till you just have to either watch it again or go out and buy the soundtrack which is equally a wonderful as the movie.
4,Hedwig & The Angry Inch,"A great Cult Flick. When he goes Drag, you just about want to Choke UR Chikn.. If'n UR into dat stuff. It was reasonably priced and promptly delivered."
3,2 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Decent, if thoroughly off-the-wall, for the majority of its running length, ""Hedwig"" flies off the rails in a disappointing conclusion that leaves the viewer with the impression that the filmmakers didn't know where to take their eccentric German transsexual wannabe rocker."
1,It worked for a little while,"This product seemed to have such promise. I used it for a little while, once I figured out what to do, and it worked well. Then one day the metal cover came off the top and bottom. I could snap it back together and it would continue to work, but the pieces would not stay together. It is now laying on the desk next to my computer, topless and not working. It proved too fragile for me."
4,Fascinating Urban Tale,"A fascinating urban tale of love, sex, struggle, ambition, and dreams. The main character, Eduardo, embodies qualities that most Honduran bring with them on their journey north."
5,Very comprehensive and helpful,"Yes, as one person noted, the humor is sort of out of place. Bad puns throughout. I'm still giving it a 5 because it's the most helpful sprout book I've seen.Friends of mine recommended it to me - they have an attractive set-up of baskets of sprouts growing in little seed-germinator covered plastic trays. They are thrilled with the book, and we are excited about starting to sprout. We did sprouts years ago in jars, but this system is better.Though the book could be more condensed, it's still an easy read in a few hours. And where else is this vital information available in such thorough detail? If you are considering sprouting, you will find the information valuable."
4,Sprouting 101 thru 110,"Basic sprouting here, its many benefits are told as they should be!! Buy this ,and get some seed, you are ready to go!! What ever kind of seed that You would want to possibly sprout is in here.The exact instructions on how to grow them too. Have fun ,and get healthier too, eat your sprouts, they are good for you! What a wonderful idea.A food that you can grow anywhere, does not even need light, dirt, only add some water, a little time, and You have fresh, organic food right where ever You are."
2,Disappointing,"Only covers sprouting in baskets and bags. A whole lot of proselytising but NO recipes! Bought the Kindle edition because it was inexpensive, but really feel it was a waste of time. I would have liked a focus on practical, concise advice, rather than long-winded preaching about how fabulous sprouts are."
4,"The Complete Guide to Sprouting, Sprouts, The Miracle Food","I thought I knew all about sprouting seeds from doing it years ago. Once I got into just the first few chapters of Sprouts, The Miracle Food, I realized I didn't know ""nuttin."" The book is great with some humor thrown in also. However, I would encourage anyone to purchase whatever revision is the newest. Once I visited the author's website, [...], I learned he has made some changes to what he had written about in the revision I purchased. Had I known about some of these changes, it would have saved me many hours trying to locate some of the supplies he had written about."
1,too much,"soak the seeds 1 day, rinse for three days and eat. no recipes, only directions on growing. don't see the use."
2,Some things should not be done...,"...such as remaking Gone With The Wind, writing another book on the battle of Gettysburg, and another orchestration of Pictures At An Exhibition. Ravel got it right the first time. The Finnish Radio Symphony's playing on this recording is uninspiring, perhaps because they knew that if this were the only orchestration of the Moussourgsky's piano piece, Pictures would never have become an all-time concert favorite. Save big bucks and avoid this version. Instead, buy the venerable Reiner/Chicago Symphony recording to get the Ravel orchestration and Adolph Herseth, the greatest orchestral trumpeter of all time, playing in his prime."
2,I regret purchasing this download.,"I found this particular orchestration rather alienating and difficult to listen to. It seems like certain changes were made simply for the sake of change, diminishing the atmosphere and emotion of the music. For example, at the climax of ""Bydlo"", the flourishing symbols are exaggerated to the point of making me want to throw off my headphones. Very disappointing.This also leads me to the downside of downloading MP3s instead of buying cd's: You can't return a download. But if I could, I would definitely return this one."
4,Cool cd,"This CD was released in 2005.It was a powerful night with 10,500 worshippers.I bought this one soon after its release.I was enjoying being a Christian at the time,but these days i watch the Christain channel and do not attend a chuch at all.You get to see Brian Houston and his very enthusiastic and inspirational Bible teachings.As well as the current songs from their recent Cds.This Cd captures the magic of Hillsongs enjoyable music.You cant go wrong with Hillsongs releases."
5,Hillsong loves glorifying God,I love this album and all the rest of their albums at that. This album is amazing!
3,"Not anything catchy here, unfortunately.","I have the DVD, which is has the same music has the CD, minus two songs. The DVD is well done technically, though the editing is a bit frantic, shifting shot to shot (no shot lasts more than 5 seconds; most last about 2 seconds).Anyhow, the music, technically well done, with Hillsong's usual high level of musicianship, are just not catchy, certainly nothing like past albums. It's not to say the lyrics aren't praiseful, just not something that you'd find yourself humming later, and can't get out of your head."
1,Another press released for $5.95,"Save your money, this is an ""article"" from a product new page... basically a press release."
1,Poorly packaged DVD,"Spending about 50.00 for a training DVD, I suspect it to arrive new and unused. I got the package from amazon with the DVD flopping around in the unsealed case. The DVD looked like it has been in the trunk of someone vehicle. Very disappointed, first impressions are ever lasting. I WILL NOT order another from this series. Buyer you have been warned!Mark Daughn Glamour Lighting 201: Ultimate Single Light Setup DVD"
5,San Francisco Vampire Hunter,"This is truly an unusual evasive book...much like the vampire it strives to be about. I like many, read this story and felt its alluring charm... Only to have it slip out of my hands...Lost it on a train ride in Europe... Have gone to ""The ends of the world"" to recover this book. Venturing into old dusty bookstores to find this ""Out of Print"" item. Paris, London , New York, Sydney...... Any one who can contain this mercurial book for awhile will attest to it's....otherworldy qualities..."
4,New Skin Scar Fade Topical Gel,I ordered New Skin Scar Fade Topical Gel to remove a discoloration from a scar under my bellybutton. I was scratching there for a long time and the cut only got worse over time. Ive been using it now for I'd say a month and there are little spots that are significantly lighter than the scar originally was. I do feel that over more time it will be at least almost faded away completely.The texture is really sticky though.
2,waste of money,"Does not work for me. I read into effective scar treatments and figured that because I didn't want to use a silicone tape, a silicone gel should work instead. However, upon using this product for several weeks, I noticed that my scar has become significantly raised and darker in color. Now I am stuck with two tubes of this..."
4,better than maderma,I've used this product for several months now on several scars...works well and faster than I expected. I've tried maderma as well and find this product significantly better.
1,Ineffective Product,"I purchased this product to help improve a scar that resulted from a road rash injury. After applying the gel religiously for almost 3 months, I saw no improvement in scar appearance. I believe it helps to moisturize the skin, but nothing more. It's glorified moisturizer and a total scam."
1,DIDNT WORK AT ALL BUT SPECTRAGEL DID,this was just one of the couple other scar creams i tried that didn't work to get rid of the scars left on my face from trying to get rid of milia bumps with a needle.. but the scar gel Spectragel did work... my face finally looks like it did 2 years ago before i even got the bumps... would say get Spectragel over this stuff
1,Opera glasses,"Horrible visual quality. Lenses were cloudy around the edges. I got an ""I told you so"" from my husband who thought they were too cheap to be any good. He was right. I sent them back and went to a local sporting goods store and bought the smallest quality binoculars I could find. Visually, they are far superior. However, I'd still like to find good opera glasses."
5,THIS PEANUT BUTTER MIXER REALLY WORKS!,"i have always wanted a convenient way to stir the oil at the top of my peanut butter into the rest of the jar without fighting with a blunt kitchen knife and fork, sometimes splashing peanut oil on me during the struggle. finally someone invented a simple yet efficient way of easily stirring the peanut butter while the jar lid is closed. try it, you'll be glad you did! there are larger stir lids for the larger jar sizes."
5,Witmer peanut butter mixer,This is a neat kitchen tool. It fits perfectly on Smucker's natural peanut butter jar. I store it on an empty jar in my cupboard as suggested by another customer! I love it!
3,good idea but not effective,"Bought this to mix peanut butter, but have only used it for almond butter. It broke the ""solid"" into large clumps, then just pushed the clumps around in the oil. Might work better for peanut butter."
1,Disappointed,"My review is 'don't bother.'I put this on my wish list after seeing it on (I think) the 'Cool Tools' website. I wish I would have read Joseph Rukaj's review so I would not have received the 'almost right' size as I prefer the Trader Joe's PB. Regardless, I have sufficient hand strength to hold it securely during use but, I still need to finish mixing the PB with a knife, spoon, spatula, whatever, like before because the peanut butter is merely 'stirred,' not really mixed.What use is a tool that requires you to finish the job with the tool you bought the first tool to replace? Clever doesn't count for much if it doesn't solve the problem. I'd return it if I could."
3,Could be better,"Bought this Witmer Company Peanut Butter Mixer, Model 100 back in 2009, and now that I have over three years experience with it, I have a few observations.First I have have used it exclusively with Smuckers Natural Peanut Butter, both creamy and chunky. As far as the curved mixing part that fts inside the jar, it does a pretty good job. My real complaint is with the white rubber washer that fits inside the lid. After about a year it dislodged and does not function as it was intended. After mixing, it floats on top of the newly mixed peanut butter. Actually, it is a bit easier to clean but that is not the way it is supposed to work. The cranking handle works exactly like a cranking handle should work.One other thing that help this work better is to turn your jars of peanut butter upside down for about two weeks before you do any mixing. It helps to distribute the oil and makes the mixing much easier and certainly more uniform."
1,"Got the right size, but it doesn't work....","There is a design flaw in that it only stirs the bottom 1/4"" of the jar as some other reviewers have mentioned. Tried it vertical and horizontal and also tried long duration of cranking, but the gravitational pull where I am (500' above sea level) isn't strong enough to draw the unstirred peanut butter into the stirring rod. It probably works fine in death valley but am going to return it since it's summer there now which would boil the peanut butter into a stirred state.On the bright side, the rod was clean enough after removing to put back in the package for return shipping. I was really hoping this gadget would work."
1,Awful,This product did not work at all. It made even more of a mess than just taking a spoon and mixing up the peanut butter. I was really disappointed. It looked so cool.
1,whoops,"I probably would have been happy with the product, had i known that it came in different sizes. Mine does not fit the size jar i use and it is the 'only' size for that particular product. I must have thought that peanut butter or sunflower seed butter came in standard size jars. Therefore mine is not very useful to me. I'm sure its a good product other wise, just be sure to know what size to buy."
3,why?,"i use my handheld mixer with only 1 beater on it. hold the jar well and there will be no splattering, it does a great job...you can really whip it up and i would imagine it does a better job than this gadget...one less thing in my drawer!"
2,Doesn't work as expected,I purchased the wrong size top (didn't realize there were different sizes - you should be warned/reminded when purchasing). I was still able to use the product but it does not mix the peanut butter as well as I thought it would. It works better to mix by hand. This item was a disappointment:(
2,Doesn't Work on New Plastic Peanut Butter Jars,"Works Great on the older glass peanut butter jars. However, the glass jars are only still being used by the expensive ""name brand"" manufacturers.These guys need to get off the dime and produce a version for the new style plastic peanut butter jars.The package still says NEW! But, the product is really OLD!"
5,Love this mixer!,What a great invention! We keep the mixer in/on the jar and give it a few churns before opening and spreading. Love the bladder in the middle of the top that allows the mixer to be removed cleanly!...FABULOUS IDEA for us health nuts (no pun intended!)
3,Works but just ok,I sent this as a gift to someone who eats a lot of natural peanut butter. The feedback I got was that this product does work but so does a spoon.
4,a handy item,"Natural peanut butter tastes so much better than the homogenized versions. But the separation of the product requires you to have to stir and stir. That can get messy and time consuming. This device makes that task quicker, easier and cleaner. It works pretty well, altho depending on how fussy you are, you may have to still stir it with your knife to completely mix it up."
4,"Great idea, wrong size","The item rates 5 stars... it does a great job of mixing and I am very happy with it. However, the supplied lid size was too big to fit 16 oz Trader Joe's peanut butter jars and required a relatively easy modification before we could use it. I drilled a hole in the center of a TJ lid (plastic) and then threaded the rod portion of the mixer through the hole. Works fine now, with the supplied metal lid resting on top of the plastic lid for stability. MIXERS TO FIT DIFFERENT LID SIZES ARE AVAILABLE from the manufacturer, so you might want to check that out first."
5,Love this item!,Couldn't be any easier to use. I was trying to stir my almond/peanut butter with a knife and didn't realize how much was never really mixed. Now from top to bottom it is fully mixed and once you pull the handle out it is virtually clean....no mess. Love it and would definitely recommend it.
4,Clever little tool!,"The only thing I wish it had was a set of variable sized lids. I buy Trader Joe's peanut butter, and the lid is smaller. It works great, even by just covering the smaller lid with the larger one, and we don't dread opening a new peanut butter."
2,"Lovely idea, except for not fitting on any of my peanut butter jars","This doesn't need to be a long review. I was intrigued by the concept of this mixer, especially since I love natural peanut butter but hate the stirring. I suspect that if I could find a brand that used a jar of the correct diameter I'd be in love with this thing. But that's asking a lot of me as a consumer."
4,Magnificent Peanutbutter Mixer,The peanutbutter mixer works great. Insert it into a newly opened jar of peanutbutter and crank for two minutes. Voila! the oil on top is mixed into the peanutbutter. Pull out the mixing blade and it self-cleans on the lid. Peel out the lid liner and wash the lid and liner.Witmer Company Peanut Butter Mixer
1,Received the wrong item,"I ordered a Model 100, but received a Model 300. Unfortunately I did not notice the error so I have a model that does not work and is not returnable."
2,Lid only fits some jars,"The lids of peanut butter jars are not necessarily standard. The lid with the product only fits some jars on the market. If the lid fits the product works fine, it the lid doesn't its useless."
4,Perfect for a chinchilla,This is the right size for a chinchilla. He enjoys tearing off the outer paper and sleeping in the center. There isn't much else to say about this product :)
2,Ending Not Buy-able,"I liked the story. The major conflict, however, was quickly resolved in the last few pages in a way that I wasn't buying. The characters are fun and likable, but I've read better by this author."
1,Typical Romance Book,"In my opinion the Plainsman doesn't differ from any other harlequin type story line.The story was weak and predictable as were the characters.The french accent was horrible and I just couldn't get into it.There is a loooooottttt of repetition of the obvious and in my opinion a lot of the dialogue was page fillers.You hear the same conversations over and over.As always the main character is a beautiful woman/handsome man who is strong willed, stubborn,beautiful...yada yada yada.The Christian tone is over shadowed by the fluffy romance.I strongly recommend that you look elsewhere unless you just like weak romance stories..."
1,"Terrible, didn't finish it!","The plot was so hackneyed that I could guess the next scene. I kept hoping it would get better, but it didn't. Very predictable. I couldn't stand any more after a while and put it down unfinished."
2,a detached book,"I liked this book, but we really could have done without. I love the characters and the romance; Lori Copeland is best at funny romance. This book best fits after The Peacemaker. It just seemed like her editors told her ""Lori we need a fourth, can you come up with anything else"". I mean we heard his name, even in The Maverick, and it just seems like a logical story. But it was too late in the series.I would have read it as a stand alone. But it still lacked basis. Get 'em next time Lori!"
2,disappointed,"I was very disappointed in Lori's fourth book to her series ""Men of the Saddle"". I loved the three earlier books in this series, and I was looking for another great book. The only connection to the previous books comes at the end when Beau & Cole & two other guys show up to help Trey save the town. They also talk as if the events in this book happened before the previous three books. The book seems boring, and not up to the quality of her previous books in this series."
2,Not so great.,"Well, I must say - I'm with the majority on this last book of the Men of the Saddle series. I found it very boring and porly written. Sorry Lori. I liked all the others though. I'm just glad this wasn't the first of the series because I wouldn't have continued. The plot was weak and somewhat rediculous. I was unimpressed and just skimmed the last 1/2 in order to get it over with. And the ending was anticlimactic to say the least."
4,What A Great First Film,"Scorsese as everyone reading this review or thinking about buying this item probaly already knows is one the greatest living filmmakers. Maybe its having lived in the Tri-State area my whole life and having close relatives of Italian decent, but I have always found the films of Scorese hitting close to home in many ways. The characters live and breathe on screen in such a way-its unbelievable. Okay that said let me move on to the movie at hand, Scorsese having made most of this in film school-its impressive beyond belief, it has so much raw energy to it, the scenes involving the guys just hanging out seem so real, and also as a director he shows some very stylish stuff-cinema stuff-its not as polished or as great as Mean Streets-but for anyone interest in film or Scorsese i say its a must see..."
2,"Well, if you like bubble gum...","Tahiti 80 just doesn't do it for me. If you're into the likes of silly, light-hearted pop tunes, then maybe it's for you. Nothing is soul moving or stirring. I heard a coupla of harkenings of chili peps riffs here and there, but it just didn't get it."
2,Good but.....,If you're looking for a partner or to investigate the lifestyle with someone you do not know well this book may be helpful. But if you're looking to initiate this activity with your current partner much of what is discussed is not applicable.
1,A new old battery is still an old battery,"I purchased one of these batteries for my aging TravelMate expecting that the new battery would function just like the one that came with my new laptop. I was really disappointed. It was no better than the one I'd been using for 2 years. I have since found out that these batteries lose their ability to hold a charge just as much sitting on a shelf as they do in the computer. A hundred dollars plus later, my computer battery is still good for less than an hour. Try one of those places that replace the cells in your existing battery. You have more of a chance that it will work."
1,Not for my Yamaha Guitar,"I bought this set of pins just to replace the original plastic pins installed as I bought my guitar few months back. However, I thought it would fit in but as I try to install it, it's useless. It's too short and small that it wiggles as you push it all down. It doesn't even hold the ball end of the string.So for you guys out there who owns a yamaha guitar, it won't do a thing. So I ended up giving these pins to my friend. I just got nothing out of 14bucks. Im still finding a brass pin that would fit on my Yamaha guitar. I'm frustrated."
4,Beautiful! But don't get your hopes up about the sound,"I love the way these look on my black guitar. They were a little too big for the holes, though, so they don't sink all the way in, but they still work fine. I honestly can't tell any difference in the sound, but they are totally worth the price just for the look."
1,Not for my Martin.......,These pins originally fit nicely with the first string replacement. After that they no longer would hold. They are uselessfor my Martin 000-28.
1,Not what I thought at all,So I got them in on the estimated delivery date which was great! But when i opened them they really felt like plastic. Then i was like let me just go install them and see. Well when you have to tune the guitar to a higher pitch the pin comes flying out and hit my wall.. Would not recomend this product. Your better off with practice
4,So Pretty,"So i bought these pins to spruce up my guitar and indeed they did. I broke my G string in the process and i had some trouble getting them in, but not that they're in and snug i dont think they'll be coming out anymore."
5,Jack's Back,"Jack's back and better than ever, Sir David Jason's impish detective returns with three episodes each more delicious than the other. If you haven't seen Jack this will open your eyes to the finest of many fine English flashing light dramas. Jack bedevils Horn-rimmed Harry, out thinks the villians and creates merry hell around the Denton nick, you just won't have more fun and in the end you'll want all of the Frosts. The saddest news, David Jason intends to retire Jack after Season Seventeen is blunted by the knowledge that there are three more seasons awaiting DVD. Buy them all and share with your friends, they will thrill with delight, burn with envy and in the end buy the lot for their very own."
5,wonderful trombone CD,"Trombone players of the world should really like this. (Other folks should, too.) His ""theft"" of works for other instruments is beautiful, fun, moving, and just plain great. The variety of selections is good. Who needs a violin for Albinoni when you have a trombone around? Get this one!"
3,Missing 18 Songs,"I have the DVD of the show (5 stars!!) and wanted to get a CD. Unfortunately, the CD only has 20 of the 38 songs. If the CD had all the songs, I would buy it.This applies to the Doo Wop 51 CD (only 20 of 34 songs).Too bad Rhino didn't issue a 2 CD set with all the performances."
3,Colors of the Sea Review,"This book probably isn't as bad as I rank it--I was simply expecting something different than what I got. This book's focus is on colors of marine ANIMALS...it has nothing to do with basic reef/tropical photography.As far as the pictures in the book are concerned, there are many very beautiful ones throughout. However, unless you are highly interested in close-ups of starfish, seahorses, and shrimp, I don't recommend this book. If you ARE interested in these things, then this book is a real value--like I already mentioned, the pictures are very high quality and, well, colorful."
2,Bad Linear Algebra book,"There are lots of problems, but it does not help you do any of the proofs, even with the student solutions manual. It might answer one or two, but mostly shows computational work. I don't really like how this book explains things, but that's just a personal opinion. This book is pointless if you are not taking the class or do not already understand the material. I'm taking the class, and watching YouTube MIT lectures along with it."
3,Histerical Comedy,"Not the best Anime-Comedy I have seen. It tries too much to be funny, though it is at times. It is not bad, but also not great. For comedy fans not funny enough and for martial art fans the fights are not cool enough. But for the price it is ok if you got a little too much time and don't know what to watch.If you like insane comedies, try ""Seto no Hanayome"" (My Bride Is a Mermaid), not only for girls, I swear!"
4,"A MODERN, CLASSIC FRAGRANCE","Shi, the fragrance by noted designer Alfred Sung, is reminiscent of his total design philosophy which is classically modern, whether it be clothing, watches or small leather goods. This fragrance is subtle, fresh with a blend of Water Lily and Fig Leaves. Complementing the initial impression is a composition of Orange Blossom and Frangipani, resulting in a soft feminine scent.As one would expect the packaging, both bottle and box, is elegant simplicity. Utilizing three of nature's elements, wood, water, and metal, Sung has created a beautiful design. The bottle, a perfectly rounded glass rests on a dark wood base. On top of the cap is the Chinese symbol for water. Viewed as a whole, the bottle reminds one of a perfect drop of water.The box is a pale blue with the Chinese water symbol on the top panel.This fragrance would certainly be appropriate for day or evening."
5,Frued is underrated and provides a great solution for Incra users,"I have owned many Freud/Diablo router bits and saw blades and this set maintains the same high standards. Any bit will cut sharp when new. But the Freud bits and blades last much longer than cheaper brands and as long as more expensive brands like Whiteside, Infinity, Eagle America, and Lee Valley. They also did not provide a complete set of bits to match the Incra Ultra/WonderFence like Freud does. It is nice to know I can do everything in the Reference Guide with the Freud package.Keep your bits and blades clean (I use Calgon/Simple Green) and you will get years of use from these tools. I have just cut over 1500 board feet with these bits and the dovetails/dattos are as perfect as the first."
1,Who do they think they are?,"It is the height of arrogance (and stupidity) to make router bits without showing their size on them! All you get is a 5-digit part number and a big Freud logo! How do I tell if this is 9- or 7-degree dovtail bit! If this wasn't a Christmas gift, it would be going right back. And then I tried one of their bits and it was undersized. Don't go for the name try somebody else."
3,brown,"delivery took a long time, and the color is not exactly as in the picture. it is actually much more closer to a brown (a very brownish brick red). I like the shape, size and the chopsticks, but had hoped for a red bowl so was somewhat disappointed. somewhat large for a rice bowl, appropriate size for a big bowl of cereal or pasta."
2,98 degrees,Don't get me wrong. I love 98 degrees but I just didn't like this CD. I guess it was just that I didn't like the interviews. I like the songs.
2,I have to agree with MitchDennis,"Although the imagery was colorful, the writing was weak. It grew so tiresome to read on about their struggles to almost kill their nemesis. Every time they could have finished the job, there were objections about how wrong it is to kill any living thing (even those bent on your own destruction). And the mentions of how the most civilized of us have eschewed meat as a source of food. Over and over again these themes were vocalized as major plot points and character values. I for one get sick of being bludgeoned with someone's personal opinions when I'm trying to read a book for fun. I don't think I'll be continuing with this series."
4,"Good, but...","I found a good many grammatical errors, most of which were in punctuation (i.e. periods where question marks should be, etc). There were a few other errors, as well, but the book as a whole was pretty good. Not quite as high quality as her other two Dragon Nimbus series, however. It seemed to lack something. Nevertheless, it was a good read."
3,The Modern Day Gothic Vampire,"Blood Worship is a vampire story set in the hot and steamy climes of Florida. It centres around the teen goth culture and you could at first be forgiven for feeling that Sang Adorer is just another crazed psychopath with sanguinarian tendencies......but as Barbara Mack reveals in shocking detail he is the ""real deal"".Jessie Hartwell is not your typical embodiment of the media perception of a goth, having dealt with her mothers tragic and grisly demise she is well equipped for the final showdown with Sang Adorer and his minions.This tale takes you through the standard vampire mythologies and is fast paced running rapidly into the showdown where the speed slows to create a frisson of tension as you enter the house that has been transformed into a temple of bloodlust.To say more would be to give away the plot of the book but if you are looking for an entertaining, slightly risqué vampire tale to fill your time with this one should amply suffice."
4,spooky fun,"I read this book in one big gulp; and I loved it. I'm a fan of vampire novels, any kind, and though I like the 'vampire as tortured hero' type, I like the horror-filled, gore-soaked type also, and this one definitely fits in that genre. Throw in some hot sex scenes (and the sex scenes in this book are definitely sizzling), and I'm a fan for life.Jessie is a sympathetic character, and the back-and-forth between her and her dead mother is very amusing. The ending was a nail-biter, very suspenseful and climactic.I hope to see more from this author."
4,Great introduction to the Forgotten Realms,"This excellent starting module (levels 1-4) for the Forgotten Realms is quite rare... 1995 was when TSR was at the height of its financial troubles, and the print run was shamefully small. When Randal Morn delved into the Tomb of Shraevyn, seeking the dreaded Sword of the Dales, everyone feared that he would become the invincible ruler of Daggerdale. But, since he never returned, and the tomb is rumored to be filled with treasures and dark intrigue, it's perfectly natural that the PCs would want to follow in his footsteps! What they'll find, though, will horrify them, and either make them stronger, or give them good reason to roll those attribute dice again... ;)"
1,Not the dance group LIME,"This is not the dance group LIME, this artist also named LIME is a jazz, blues artist. Do not confuse the 2."
2,Works -- but not for long,"This bit worked for less than two hours before the bearing broke off. I took it in to my bud at the lumber store to see if he had parts to possibly fix it, but he had another broken one sitting on his desk, that some other customer had returned because it broke after only a few hours. It started out cutting well, but it just doesn't hold up. If you only need it for very light use, it might be fine, but I can't recommend it."
2,Defective,Blades are sharp and perfectly balanced. This piece had a defective bearing which fell off after first 2 minutes of use.
2,"The syndicate may look scarey, sound scarey, but they weak",The sentence up their describes it all. To many people try to play them bad when they are actually the weakest technos..
2,"Some Good, Some Not So Good","I think the author does a nice succinct and clear job of presenting the essence of object relations theory re couple conflicts. The book is quite weak, though, on technique ,i.e., how to actually use an object relations understanding to promote change. I also thought the author was too readily dismissive of other styles of couple interventions that can be used in conjunction with an OR view."
2,At least you can learn a little more about OR...,"Donovan's book unfortunately runs into the modern trap of ""well, all therapies work according to the same basic principles of change."" After a complex and sometimes incoherent exposition, which is much more theory than practice, he takes a wild turn into this rabbit hole of equivocation. Seriously, even if all therapies work according to the placebo effect, research still shows that therapies only work when rigorously applied. So if you are writing an OR book, stick to OR, and have at least one practical chapter.However, there are some great ideas in here making it necessary reading for anyone interested in OR. However, if one wants to get down to nuts and bolts, read the Scharffs instead--their article in the ""Clinical Handbook of Couples Therapy"" is worth three of these books."
4,Great concert,"The audio quality is awsome, alway were a very tight group, and still are. Great tunes, played, filmed, and recorded great, non better."
5,This is nothing more than Kansas Master Piece.,"Excellent presentation, the best sogns, beautiful memories, a master piece,a wonderful family reunion. We really enjoyed very much. We strongly recommend it."
1,"Good Sound, horrible picture!","Like the title says, Kansas still pulls it off musically. Unfortunately the video is so blurry whenever someone on stage or the camera moves, it is rendered unwatchable. I could barely make it through the first three songs before I gave up trying to watch and just listened as I moved about the house. Tried this DVD on several players and my computer, all with the same results. Perhaps mine is defective? Is it worth the hassle to try to return to Amazon? Probably not. Live and learn."
3,This smells of Magnification-Misguided Yes Path,"I agree totally with Ron Fent. In his review, he states that the symphony adds little and actually ""dulls"" down the songs. That being said, I still recommend it for fans- I love this band and their awesome songs and I suppose I will keep this as a collector.I doubt very much that I will watch it again. I wish they would just drop the symphony bit- it's old and tired. And, as Fent said, just watch the ""Down the Road"" segment at the end. Now that's a classic prog rock band(minus the oddball symphony)!!"
4,orchestral rock,"Very good dvd, nice camera shots, excellent sound (5.1,2.0, and dts), cool play list, but I missed people of south wind. Steve Morse and Kerry Livgren also play in some songs. In some songs the university orchestra sound is superb. I think the only cons is the stage was a little bit dark .(review for regular dvd)"
3,Kansas DVD,"This was the first time Ive received a damaged package from Amazon, and I was disappointed. I had ordered the ""No Place Like Home"" DVD from Kansas, and it arrived damaged. Of course, I did not want to go thru the hassle of returning it and having to wait more time for another one to arrive, so I just delt with it. But was not happy."
2,"Ehhh, It's OK!!!","I'm watching it now for the first time. Honestly, it's the best they sounded in years, however that doesn't mean that it hits the sound of old. Morse should have played on the whole show. He brought more energy. Much more than Walsh now who just hides behind the keyboards. I don't expect the handstands at his age, but put some life into it. Oh yeah, what's with the footage during Icarus II??? I don't want to see that garbage. I want to see a concert. The same this during Miracles out of Nowhere on the poorly produced Device Voice Drum. Stupid. Just plain stupid. I'm glad that I got this from Netflix. Not worth the price. They were my first concert during the Power tour. I wish I had footage of THAT tour. Still blows my mind. They were once great."
1,Not very good,"I installed this on a 1992 Mitsubishi 3000GT VR4. My old boots were cracking, but not yet leaking, so the CV joint was good and I hoped using this product would be good maintenance.Installation was difficult for a split boot. The supplied solvent glue has a tendency to dissolve holes in the boot when used in the amounts described by the instructions.I just checked the boot after six months of use. The end seals are poor. The large end is leaking grease, and the small end seams loose on the shaft."
4,A fine replacement for a DIY project.,"I wasn't interested in spending $250+ for a garage to repair my CV boot, so I tried one of these a few years back. Now, I hadn't really done much work on a car before this, but my brother had, and he told me how to do it.It was about an hour job, and not too difficult. The boot has lasted about six years now, with no issue. This was on my 1993 Probe GT.There certainly were tricky bits, but it was well worth saving the $230."
4,Dorman quick boot kit,"This product was easy to use, stood up to the use and is still working. I would recommend this product."
1,Lousy solution for a cracked boot,"This part is shown in many places I checked to be ""Exact Fit for your 1996 Subaru Legacy Outback"". I liked the idea of saving the time and effort of removing the whole axle assembly, etc. It is NOT an exact fit and it CANNOT BE MODIFIED to be an exact fit. (I'm yelling on purpose) I wasted 3 hours and 20 bucks on this part and where I'm annoyed is- DORMAN KNOWS IT DOESN'T WORK, BUT THEY ALLOW IT TO BE SHOWN AS AN EXACT FIT BY THEIR RETAILERS. Don't buy it unless you have used it before and you KNOW it works for the application. Dorman doesn't supply dimensions to ensure fitment- your only shot at that is to go to the Dorman website and see if your car is listed. Apparently they don't mind if their retailers give out wrong info, but they don't want to- not directly. I wouldn't trust them on this one, after having had the experience. Hey I could have bought a complete remanufactured axle assembly for 50 bucks, which is what I'm going to have to do now."
1,poor fit,"did not fit my 99 corolla well at all. It is virtually impossible to glue this on the vehicle without getting grease on the seam, rendering it impossible to glue at the joint"
1,faulty product,i got the boot and went to install it and the boot itself was torn!this is a poor quality product.just do the job right with a real boot and axle.
4,Great Cd,These two make great music together. The cd has a little of everything. I enjoyed it very much. Who says white women shouldn't rap?She pulls it off very well and she can sing. Byron has a great voice too.The music is varying and interesting. Can't wait for their next CD.
4,A+ for service,"Very good customer service from the manufacturer, Plaston. I had a slightly older version of this humidifier that stopped working after about a year. When I called the company someone picked up the phone who knew all about the product. I sent them the broken humidifier and they sent me a new one right away.Apart from the fact that my first one broke down, I've been pretty satisfied with this product. My old humidifier used expensive disposable wicks, which used to get filthy after just a few days of New York City air. With this one, you just empty the water pan and wipe it down once in a while. Once every month or so, you have to clean the discs. This can be a pain without a dishwasher."
3,Works Fine...,The product works fine but the fan jiggles and is not as quiet at night as I would prefer it to be.
2,"decent air filter, poor humidifier","WE felt that the air filter worked well, but the humidifier did not. We still had same symptoms of dryness after suing it for two weeks. As soon as we got a different humidifier (not a combo unit) we felt relief). We were just trying to save space by getting a combo unit but unfortunately, we did not get the results we hoed for."
3,CD and Radio are decent,The problem I have with this player is that when you are playing a tape the machine makes an awful background sound. I was very dissapointed because I wanted to be able to play my tapes at the office. The radio and the CD players sound quality is good.
4,good deal,"I wanted a tape and cd player but did not want to spend alot. This was perfect, has a good sound and seems to work well. Great deal for the price."
1,It is broken right at the expiration of guarantee period,I bought it due to the low price and the review - seemed to be very durable. However it is broken right after 90 days which is the guarantee period. Apparantly the manufacturer has tested the product well enough to know that it won't last for a year.
1,Do Not Buy,"Don't buy this product, especially if you are thinking you would be doing something nice for a young person. This is the kind of thing that breaks the day you give it. It is utter trash. I got exactly two plays of a cd before the CD player stopped working. The sound quality isn't bad but the radio signals come in very weakly, both AM and FM, so there isn't much of an opportunity to judge the sound any way. The worst thing is that it was too cheap to bother with the postage to return it.I'm stuck with half a product.A COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY! DO NOT BUY!Portable Am/fm/cd Boombox with Cassette Player/recorder"
1,Defective product Guarantee given,"Jwin Jxcd428 Portable Cd Am/Fm Stereo Radio Cassette Player/Recorder (Purchased on 05/06/2008)by jWINThe product above did not play CD,s or Tapes the company returned the money for the product and postage in great timeRosemarie"
1,Faulty power cord,"Don't buy this product! Faulty power cord in brand new package. No way to order just the cord, so you have to use batteries only. Power cord receptor sockets don't fit pins on machine. No phone number to call customer service. Instruction/user manual doesn't include a model number on the power cord only. You can buy a similar machine at WalMart for $10 less and at least return it if it doesn't work."
4,Nice little portable Cd Am/Fm Cassette Player/Recorder,"For the price, this little radio is a good buy. It does everything a higher priced machine can do for a fraction of the cost. If you aren't looking for high quality sound, and something for a small space, this is a nice little all around machine. Great for the office, cabin, or even as a gift for a child."
2,This one almost had it...,"As a fan of occult horror films I'm always on the lookout for a good one--they are few and far between. ""Hell's Gate 1111"" came pretty darn close. It had a great premise, and even though the storyline was a bit murky through the first half of the movie, it moved along and straightened out rather nicely toward the end. The problem with the movie was the end. It was much too abrupt and so confusing that one wonders if it isn't quite complete. Personally, I think the production company ran out of money and just slapped some alternative footage in to finish it off."
4,3.5/5,By reading the first review I thought this movie was going to be terrible because most straight-to-DVD thriller/horror movies are. I turned out to be decent. The acting is average and the movie is sort of confusing. I would give this film three stars but I'm giving it four because the movie summary review is at 2.5/5.
2,WHAT THE HELL...,"HELL'S GATE 11:11 is heavy on atmosphere and for a while, it maintains an eerie and involving plot. Unfortunately, it careens into such pseudoreligious paranoia, it defeats itself and ends up being nothing more than a muddled and incoherent mess. No name actors here folks and while it almost makes a stand in the seemingly unending spate of horror films coming out lately, it ultimately ends up being just another waste of time and celluloid."
4,"Very good, way better than expected","I dont like writting summaries for movies, so , i will let some one else take that job.Plus if you read above Amazon gives you the summary of the movie, I dont know if its theres or off of the back of the movie cover, either way its accurate enough, so be happy.Basically its a very good Ghost movie. Some what creepy, not overly scary but a bit creepy. If you are into ghost movies its worth the buy. check it out, rent it, buy it what ever I personally wouldnt buy it cause Im more of a slasher/zombie fan.But a solid movie with a very cool plot, very good acting, good pace never gets boring and stays quit interesting, and keeps you focused and awake. I personally thought it was an excellent movie the ending which was not bad, but I wasnt to fond of it think it could have been better, but still not bad."
4,Good ghost story,"This is a pretty good one! I had low expectations with considering the other reviews plus the price is so cheap. Just what I call a hidden gem. This movie has more originality than most of your current ghost stories. It has that great eerie atmosphere a ghost story should have, filmed well, and good acting/directing. I enjoyed it...four stars!"
3,Out of Print,"This title is out of print. Some of the material is available on ""A Texas Travel Guide: The Best of Kenneth Johnston and The Curable Interns Volume Two."""
4,Kung Fu Fighting!,"The d20 system that powers DUNGEONS & DRAGONS and CALL OF CTHULHU plunges into the kung fu movie blender with BURNING SHAOLIN. A crazed romp through feudal China for mid-level characters, with opportunities for Jet Li-styled mayhem abounding, this adventure ties into Atlas Games' roleplaying game, FENG SHUI, and features material compatible with that system side-by-side with that for d20. Players of either system, however, will not find BURNING SHAOLIN's connection to another game problematic, as the text is very well organized, and tightly written.Great as a one-off for d20 players, or as part of an ongoing action campaign with FENG SHUI, BURNING SHAOLIN is excellent value for the money, with ""crunchy"" d20 rules bits for those who seek to add more flair to THEIR game, and more story-driven meat for the secret warriors that do battle in FENG SHUI."
3,"Misleading title, but great for Dalai Lama fans","This book had very little wisdom on forgiveness - but a lot on the Dalai Lama. I really liked these intimate descriptions of time spent with His Holiness, but I think the author could have done more to elucidate Buddhist concepts of forgiveness."
3,Insightful,"Victor Chan's collaboration with the Dalai Lama suceeds on two levels.It is a guide for what the Dalai Lama's message to the world is. It also is an intimate look at what it takes to be His Holiness the Dalai Lama, and who that individual is.Lucky Victor Chan to spend such large amounts of time with such a gentle and peaceful soul.The Dalai Lama's message is simple; perhaps not always easy to follow, but it issomething that any person can aspire to, not just ""The Ocean of Wisdom"".To be the Dalai Lama is the observations this book suceeds in revealing. It shows aquite human, enlightened, learned and exceptionally open minded man.The Dalai Lama's existence in our world is a blessing in itself and Victor Chan demonstrates such with his anecdotes and insights."
5,Great View of a Great Person,This book gives an amazing view into the life of his holiness the Dalai Lama. There are questions posed that relate to everyone's life and relate to all of our daily lives. I recommend this book for anyone that wants to understand why forgiveness is so important to our health.
2,Huh?,"Buy the book! The fake ""Dalai Lama"" accent in this audio book really detracts from the story, for me."
4,Great Field guide,"Peterson's field guide to mammals is one of my standard references as a mammology student. I constantly use the range maps,color identification plates, and animal descriptions. The book provides you with good identification characteristics indicated by arrows on the illustrations of each animal and a brief life history of every species north of the border. There are skull plates at the back of the book that are good for comparing different families but do not include every species and in some cases are poor positions to see defining attributes. The color plates for the most part have good illustrations but a few look hoaky like the Mountain Lion. Nevertheless, they all still provide good size comparisons and coloration of the animals. Consistant with other Peterson guides."
3,Eh...,"This is a good guide to be used in conjunction with the Kays and Wilson guide (a much more recent and complete book). It has not been updated in quite some time, but the information should not be dismissed. It works, but should not be your only mammal field guide. You will be disappointed if it is."
3,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK (Get the new 4th edition instead!),"There's a new edition of this book (Peterson Field Guide to Mammals of North America: Fourth Edition (Peterson Field Guide Series)), and it's fantastic! This third edition, however, is terribly outdated and not at all worth buying anymore. Buy the 4th edition of the book, completely redone by Fiona Reid. The new one has new color plates, more complete and updated natural history info, and colored range maps interspersed within the species accounts, instead of at the back of the book. It's the book I require of my students in the Mammalogy lab I teach at a university."
5,Great album!,"I currently have three Hello Dave albums and love them all. My best advice if you have never heard them . . . get it and listen to it - because once you do, you will be surprised you have never heard them before."
4,Fantastic New Release!,"This is I think their fourth CD and it is definately the best. It was recorded live so it has some of the band's classic songs as well as a bunch of great new ones. If you've never heard of this band, you will. Check out this disc."
1,useless,"If you can manage to get the thing to melt off a piece of solder, the solder is immediately repelled, so you can't actually get it to melt on the wire. I broke the tip after 10 minutes of frustration."
1,Waste of money,I was disappointed with the soldering tool. It did not work with a number of solders that I wanted to use.
1,Don't Waste Your Money!,"I feel it's my duty to let everyone know that this ""unauthorized documentary"" is a horrible waste of money. I shouldn't have added this CD to my Amazon Wish List without reading about this item first. (Since I'm a great fan of Marc Anthony, I simply reacted to the mention of a new release.)The narration is horrible. The narrator sounds like an idiot; she can't even pronounce his name correctly. There's no substance to this documentary. A grade schooler could have prepared a more interesting report. The interviews are barely audible.No wonder this is an unauthorized documentary. Whoever produced this CD owes an apology to Marc Anthony and any customer who spends money on this CD."
3,A Little Disappointing--With ONE Silver Lining!,"I knew I was getting a Marc Anthony documentary but had no idea the interviewer would be so horrible. HOWEVER--hearing Marc Anthony speak so candidly and openly about himself made it definitely worth the money for me. The interview is not current-it's about 4 years old but I had not heard it before. He does reveal some interesting facts about his career, his family, and his personal life. In the end, I'm glad I bought it-I'm now even a bigger fan of Marc than before."
4,Great read,"Great read, but not as good as some others by Austin such as `Wonderland Creek' and `While We're Far Apart'. The characters were powerful and very real but I found some of the dialogue stilted unlike other Lynn Austin novels. It's a story of how one secret can affect the lives of generations of women. This story sheds some light on the plight of Irish Catholic immigrants versus Protestant German immigrants during WW1 & WW11. Even if you guess the secret before the end when it is revealed you can't help but be moved. Really good book with wonderful strong women."
4,Solid and engaging,"If you're looking for a light read with an uplifting storyline based on Christian morales, look no further. This text keeps you thinking and engaged with our God."
3,Rusted junk from Amazon,These bits are a nice starter set but maybe get them somewhere else. My set was all rusted up straight out of the box from Amazon.
5,Great bits!,"I'm not going write a book, I'll just say that these bits have been what I expected. They are high quality and cut very well. The assortment is a great start for folks w/o a ton of bits. The 1/2"" size does seem to make them beefier. These bits really make it easy to do a great job on projects. I highly recommend them and besides the cheesy plastic box insert, have no qualms about the product or value."
2,Bad Choice for New Computers,"I bought this for my visiting grandson but it does not work with Windows Vista or Windows 7. The requirements info indicates that it works with ""... or better"" and that is not true. Fortunately he has an old computer at home and hopefully will be able to play it there. That does not change the fact that I purchased it for him to use while visiting us and it can't happen. This also applies to the Treasure Mountain game."
3,Walkabout Again,"This book is short, which is mostly the kinds of books I like. I think it was neat how the ""bush boy"" offered to help the children live and adapt tothe awkward surroundings. Also how somehow the two cultures learned some of each others language.... overall I think the book was good. It shows that almost anyone can survive as long as they don't give up."
4,A interesting survival story,Walkabout is a book about to kids from south carolina that end up in the middle of Australia where they are away from society. They are trying to survive and on the way a boy from some tribe called Adelaide helps them find water and teaches them how to kill fish. This book was interesting to read and a type of book that i actually do not mind reading.
3,"A adventure novel,for ages 9-12","This book is full of action. The booked is set in the Australian Desert featuring a aboriginal boy and to chidren who are city slickers. These children are Peter who is 8,and his sister Mary whose 13.These children were battling in the middle of the Australian desert after crashing there in a aeroplane. They meet a aboriginal boy which helps them survive using their environments.I enjoyed the book but it is not a great book.I found the author waffled a bit in the storey because each day seemed to repeat itself.The only tragic thing that happens in the storey is when the aboriginal boy dies.On the whole I found this quite a good book which should be rated 6 out of ten"
1,reading this book is a waste of money and time,This book was required reading in 7th grade. It uses the Australian Outback as the setting for a well intended story on racial equality. But the main character seems to be more prejudiced against the black aborigine's nudity than his skin color.
1,Thought it would be better,"After reading the first 2 chapters of the book, I was really into it, but after that everything just went downhill. Every time you think they are going to get to civilization, they don't. I feel bad that I have to write a bad review for this book, because I've never given a bad review on this site before."
2,A boring inarticulate book which does not flow.,I believe that this book is not a very enticing book.It has a very immoral story line and waffles on at times.It had a very abrupt ending which with left us not sure of what was going on.I believe that it is a very unrealistic book for the chance for you to meet a Aborigonal boy who would devote his life to two white childeren who he kept alive for many months.This book is not suitable for young kids for it had a very unclear story line.It is more a fantacy book for adults.
3,Walkabout-not worth reading,"We found the end of the book was almost the beginning of a new book , and the ending was a bit abrupt . During the whole novel we found the book didn't go anywhere . The book had some very descriptive bits, but on the whole the plot was fairly weak . We think it is a book that you either like it or you don't . The characters are described in great detail by the author, and this is what saved the book . All in all the book was a bit of a flop."
2,A very dull book and very prolonged. Vocab very good though,"The book began extremely well. The book promised but did not deliver.The story line was very draged out and it became boring, the novel contained some very good similies though. We read this book in class and as a class reader I felt the author used good clear vocab, but did not allow any space for excitement. Although the novel tells us a bit more about nature it would not apeal to boys or girls between the age of 8-14. The book was way to factual when explaining the way of the desert survival, the book ended to sudenly and left many different ending possibilities.This book is a waste of time if you are looking for a classic survival book. We personaly would recomend hatchet as a classic survilval book if you are looking at a fast flowing and adventure filled bookI hope you enjoyed our reveiw"
3,"Not very enjoyable,but it is an average novel.","Walkabout was an 'Ok' novel with an interesting story line.The situation of the characters was very realistic.The beginning of the book was quite interesting.The author used excellent vocabulary and set the scene very well and it made the reader feel that he was in for a good read.But as the story progressed,it became rather monotonous.The story just seemed to linger on and on.It didn't have a satisfactory conclusion as the reader was left pondering the novel a bit too much.However,the book taught us about different cultures,and how these different people mix. In an era where people are only now learning to successfully mix with one another,no matter what the skin colour is nor the person's background. This book teaches us about life,but it isn't a very worthwhile read."
4,An Old Favorite,"regarding Walkabout by James Vance MarshallI once, years ago, kept this book at the shop to let folks read, who were waiting to be tattooed. It was quick to read and never failed to mesmerize the reader. Afterward, we could discuss the book while the tattoo went on. Someone apparently loved it more than I, and took it. It's wonderful to have it again.It was delivered two weeks after I ordered it and was in the condition the seller had stated. I'm happy."
5,Timeless Message,"Having first read this book over 30 years ago, I find it is still in my memory as showing meaningful relationships between children of totally different cultures...relationships that can apply to people of all ages. Few books have left such a deep impression. The excellent wording placed me in Australia on the journey; I wondered, laughed and cried as did the main characters. I look forward to having my eleven year old twins read it, and get their impressions."
2,Mediocre,"I bought this movie because Manson is in it and I appreciate his artistic ability. Also, prior to buying the movie I read the description and thought the plot sounded interesting. The movie, though not terrible, does not excel in any criteria.The acting seems to be forced, the special effects are poor, and the plot starts to get repetitive and uninteresting. Manson, along with most of the stars, are only in the movie for very brief periods of time.The movie revolves around a screwed up mother who retrieves her son from his foster parents after 6 years. The mother is addicted to drugs and neglects her child while exposing him to the evil of the outside world.Many of the scenes have no relevance to the actual movie and by the end of the movie there was no apparent moral or lesson. If you want to see a ""dark"" movie such as this one that has fantastic acting and an actual plot I would recommend Requiem for a Dream."
1,Get a better book...,"Nothing turns me off like finding out that a book which is marketed as a ""true story""-- isn't.Forget it. If you want to read a NOVEL about horror, corruption and brutality that's written by a truly talented writer, let me recommend Graham Greene's ""The Comedians."" If on the other hand you don't mind being played for a sucker, read and enjoy this rubbish."
1,"RATE IT ""D"" - FOR DISJOINTED","I am not impressed by this movie. It comes across an a mix of unpleasant experiences, made all the worse by its originating from a false biography (a lie). It is hard to follow, imagine trying to read a book with each chapter saying something separate and you will understand the problem. I advise waiting until this is broadcast on the premium cable networks, it is NOT worth buying or renting."
5,Awesome!!!,"this movie is awesome, i see it last week and I think that Asia Argento knows perfectly how to show the reality, this movie is so impressive and the kids in the movie do a excellent work, Jimmy Bennet work is wonderful and the sprouse twins take the movie to a higher level. you should see it, but the movie is not recommended for kids because the movie is very realistic and very graphical, too much explicit"
4,Edited version ??,"I love this film. It's an excellent film that does not pull any punches...that being said, I wanted to know if anyone else noticed the missing scene near the end of the film. It is right after Jeremiah and Buddy are in the basement. (SPOILER) The house is supposed to explode in the next scene but instead Asia walks into the home with jeremy sisto and then it just cuts to the next scene. I don't know if I have a defective DVD or if Palm Pictures edited the film so it could have an R rating. Anyone else have the same experience?"
2,Hard to watch film,I generally love Asia Argento's films but this was hard to watch and just an all around bad film . It wasn't her acting that was bad it was the story line and cruelty that didn't set well with me . I wouldn't recommend this one.
3,Difficult to watch,"I know that this movie was based on a very successful book and true story, and the performances were very good, but watching the abuse this poor boy went through was just too much for me - I was only able to get through about half of the movie."
3,OMG!,"This movie is really disturbing, and really sad. You feel for the boy. The movie drifts off a bit. And you totaly hate the mother for her behavior/ choices she makes through out the film."
5,gets under your skin,"I have never written a review on anything, but this move is so startling and unflinching- it totally captures the horror of the book. I am now a huge fan of Asia Argento."
5,The Eleusinian Mysteries,"Anyone who has an interest in the Mysteries of Eleusis needs to read this book. Jennifer solves the puzzle with both scholarly work and great writing. Her reconstructions of the Lesser and Greater Mysteries of Demeter of Eleusis are complete, and inclusive of the myth of Demeter and Persephone, while integrating the agricultural and mystical aspects of this ancient religion. Details about the Holy Objects used in the rites, as well as background on the functioning of the clerics, and the sanctuary site make this book unique. The recreations of the mystery rites top it off. Gather your friends together, set your altar, and investigate the mysteries for yourself!"
5,Great book!!!,"This book is a wonderful resource for those interested in exploring Demetrian paganism or merely those who want to learn more about the Demeter/Persephone myth. I especially appreciated the detailed ritual scripts and descriptions of each of the festivals. The chants and poems were also very useful. The book is very dense, but it is a fast read and easily accessible."
4,Great suprise,"This CD is better than I had thought. It is very sensitive, varied with a personal style. You do listen the song number 10."
4,"Can't get past ""Blower's Daughter""","Like I'm sure countless thousands of others, I scrambled to find out who sang the beautiful, haunting song that opens Mike Nichols' adaptation of 'Closer.' I know a bunch of people must have followed the same path, because when I went to Virgin to pick up a copy, there was a large sign that said ""If you want the music from the film CLOSER"" (last word in about 128 point font on the signage) ""then you want Damien Rice's 'O'.""My problem is that that song (""Blower's Daughter"") is so good that the rest of the CD (to my ear, at least) pales in comparison. I've yet to find anything else that resonates with me. Regardless, 'O' deserves at least four stars simply based on the perfection Rice achieves on that one track."
3,So-so,"This is a fairly uneven CD--some songs are very nice, but others make you want to reach for the ""skip"" button."
5,Classic,"Blowers daughter, Amie, Older Chests, this album is packed with slow emotion that will never get old."
4,Not as good as the hype,"Allright, I thougt that this album was overall very good, but it didn't rise to the five star level that most other reviewers gave it. Most of the songs on this CD are very good and there are some that just aren't as good as the others. I heard most of the songs on the movie ""Alfie"" and decided that I had to have it after hearing ""The Blowers Daughter"" during the opening scene, but after buying it, I found that the rest of the CD falls a little short from this song. As a Ben Harper, Jack Johnson, and DMB fan, I would definately recommend this CD."
3,Depression on a disc,I found most of the songs a bit depressing. I felt like slapping him and telling him to get used to it.
1,It'll make you feel like the world has just ended...,"Okay, let's get one thing straight here people, music is about havin' fun! That's why when someone at a music store put this on through the speakers I immediately wanted to rip off my ears in disgust at how downright miserable this CD is, it made me feel like my life had just fallen apart.This Rice fella has no right to make us feel like the world is just a cesspool of sadness, what is goin' on in this man's head!?? I do like a bit of acoustic guitar music, but only when it was done tastefully, just try 'Unplugged' by Alice In Chains instead, stack up 'Brother' & 'Killer Is Me' compared to this turgid junk and you'll notice who's the REAL talent here!"
4,wow,Damien Rice is a truly inspiring and unique singer/songwriter. It's almost as if you can hear pain in his voice. He's brilliant.
5,I couldn't stop!,I Loved this CD! It is haunting and beautifully melancholy. It became an addiction!
5,A great album. More than worth the buy.,"I took a chance purchasing this album. It's utterly amazing. Damien's lyrics are both insightful and meaningful. His melodies are simple, yet haunting. You should take a chance on this one, too. He is brilliant."
5,indelible,"""O"" traces the visage of love with revealing honesty and poetic mastery. Rice's whispery voice is sensitive, sincere and evocative. The tracks ""Cold Water"" and ""Cheers Darlin'"" are by far my favorites."
4,Definately not disappointed,"This CD is enjoyable for all those love-sick, tortured souls out there. Rice is heart felt and the majority of the songs on the cd are good; obviously, not EVERY SINGLE song is, but what cd has that? I reccommend this to anyone who loves some good love songs. I am personally very happy with the purchase."
5,Beautiful folk music,"I actually first head Damien in a short commercial during Saturday Night Live with my friends. We liked what we heard, so we immediatly started downloading the music to get a better feel of it. Being in highschool, they had to go home only 10 mintues later for midnight, and so didn't get to hear what we had downloaded. I stayed up 'till 3 and listened to and fell in love with every track. Damien's voice goes perfectly with every song, and the cello is a beautiful and necessary touch. A short while later, I bought the CD because I felt a little bad for downloading them all (it's one thing to download from Led Zeppelin and The Rolling Stones, but with little artists like Damien I always buy the CD) and didn't regret it, because if I hadn't I wouldn't have gotten the gorgeous case, complete with page after page of distinct artwork. O is a must buy for any folk lover who adores heartfelt well written songs."
5,A touch of passion and melancholy,"I first discovered Damien Rice by watching the video for Volcano on VH1 and from that point this CD has become my favorite. The songs in this CD range from a wonderful raw character (The Blower's daughter, with its repetition of the ""I can't take my eyes off you"" line in different degrees of pain and with a subtle cello in the back) to the unexpected epic quality of Eskimo. This is a disc that keeps company of people with a broken heart (Cheers Darling), with memories of melancholy (Older Chests), despair (Delicate, Cold Water) or love (Volcano). His voice is passionate, his songwriting poetry and his music full of contradictory yet sublime feelings. This CD is a tremendous accomplishment in a music world where many singer-songwriters sound the same and where feelings seem manufactured. This is definitely a CD for those looking for an original approach of everyday sadness."
3,It has that one song that Iike...and that's it..,"I got it because it got the sound track of this movie called ""Closer"". Overall this album is OK."
1,Maybe I'm just not a folk fan...,"I bought this CD because I heard the second track, volcano, and I was inspired, hoping against hope that if the rest of the tracks even resembled this smash, I had found a treasure. Also, I checked the reviews at this site and they were very complimentary. HOWEVER, this CD is one of the most disappointing albums I have purchased in years. The songs are extremely repetitive, and the words...cliche would be a kind description. The singer/songwriter is no doubt a virtuoso guitarist, but he opts perpetually for the road more travelled. It would appear that he is mistaken in his assumption that just because he feigns a strong emotion, he will be able to impart some depth of soul. Instead, he drones on with melodrama, snivelling heart break with the articulation of justin timberlake. I was looking for the rebirth of jeff buckley with the intuition of Aimee mann, and instead I found livingston taylor on zoloft."
2,"Terrific voice, AWFUL songwriting","When I see all the glowing reviews for Damien Rice's ""O"", I find myself scratching my head. Is it becuase of his voice? That's probably a lot of it - he does have a superb voice. Is it because people like cookie-cutter, trite songs that they've heard done 120 different ways? I'd like not to think so, but maybe.His songwriting skills on this album are weak at best. These sort of lyrics are so overdone, so common to the genre, and so shallow, it's nauseating. Sure, I suppose his songs are ""pretty,"" or whatever the usual reaction is, but what do they really say? Absolutely nothing. There is no depth to these lyrics at all, and they're extremely repetitive.If he ever manages to write some decent songs, he'll be fantastic. That voice is undeniably strong. Until then, there are much better options available to you."
4,His Music takes you away.,"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE Damien Rice!!!! His music is differant. I love how melo and chill his music makes me feel. When I need to get it away, I pop in his ""O"" C.D."
2,I don't know...,"Maybe I'm still punch-drunk of Rufus Wainwright's magnificently rich, multi-layered, overwrought, overproduced ""Want One"", but after giving ""O"" more than its fare share of listens, it hasn't really struck a chord with me. I tend to think he is a tad overrated. If it comes down to organic, stripped down, home-made records, I'd take Ron Sexmith, David Gray, or Jack Johnson anyday."
1,So Many People Have Bad Taste,"I can't believe so many people like this album. Seriously, it doesn't explore anything interesting, it wonders through some poor man's day-dreams. I have a tendency to question the sobriety of those claiming how great it is. Otherwise, have fun with it if you're an angst-filled teenager, locked in your room, crying in self pity."
1,I love this cd,"This cd is one of my favorite cds I own. I also saw him in concert, he was fantastic. He is the next Dave Matthews."
5,OOOOOOO yeah...,"Let me just say that it takes a lot for a cd to come along and really just make me sit up and listen, and listen, and keep listening. Damien Rice's ""O"" is one of those rarities that keeps me having faith in the music industry today. Soft and yet powerful strings, mixed with the melodic blend of Damien and other musician's voices, topped with astonishing lyrics create a combination that will leave the listener speechless, which is what a good album should do. This isn't just a cd, its an artistic masterpiece that should be in everyone's collection."
5,Finally!,What a fantastic voice! It's been so long since their has been an artist that has released a CD that you can listen to from the first song to the last and totally enjoy every single track!
4,Damien Rice - Love that Voice,"The song ""The Blowers' Daughter"" was featured in a Jude Law movie (bad at remembering titles) - ""I can't take my eyes off of you"". I really liked this song but never had it until now. Love the entire album =)"
5,"Best album, best live","Damiens album is one of the best Ive heard in the last few years and Damien is absolutely brilliant live. (in Ireland anyway although difficult to get tickets). I hope he come s out with a new album soon as its been a while and a lot of people are waiting to see if O is a one hit wonder.Ive heard it on countless movies, TV programmes etc and i dont think it can ever be overplayed. I love all 10 songs on the album."
2,regretfully,"i am a ballad-lover as well, and so i really *wanted* to love this cd. and it does have its moments. ""cannonball"" and ""blower's daughter"" are both lovely. my general complaints are that the songs are overdone. i think rice's strengths are in his honest, real sound. the orchestration on some of the songs are overblown to the point that his voice is totally obscured. and some of the songs are just too long, as in the one song where he says ""i can't take my eyes off of you"" like 6 times each verse. i wouldn't be writing this if i didn't feel conflicted and disappointed. i think rice has some amazing songwriting talents - i just hope his next album is a little more taut and simple."
5,"Does anyone know the song from ""Closer""...","...in the scene where Natalie Portman is in the strip club, dancing for Clive Owen? The background song is something from the '80's - it sounds like a darker INXS or Depeche Mode, and I know that I've heard the song, but I can't think of it. I mention it here because I'm hoping that people looking for Damien Rice after seeing the movie will be able to answer the question for me.Thanks."
2,Not My Type,"First off, i would like to say that this is NOT a bad album. I'm not sure why people say he has a bad voice. I think its very good. I had heard the blower's daughter and cannon ball prior to the purchase of this cd. I thought they were both great and figured he would have some harder songs to go along with it. Mixed in with some poppier songs, this album would be great, but after about the third track it just bores me to tears. Definately not an album for ""rockers"" The other down cd is that it just seems so freakin depressing at times . . i'd feel less depressed if i lost both my arms. Thats all"
2,I was cheated!,"If you're looking to buy O because you like the Cannonball version they play on the radio, save your money. What you get with the album is a two-track version of the song--just vocals and acoustic guitar. Where are those subtle drums and the great orchestration? Thankfully Rice's skills as a songwriter are so strong, because his voice simply isn't good enough to be the focal point of an arrangement.Cannonball sounds empty, as does most of the album, which is ridiculously underproduced and poorly mixed. When I found out this was a home recording, I wasn't surprised one bit; and all I can think of was that the label released it before it was done. This is a mediocre album that could have been GREAT; and to someone like myself who writes and produces music, that's criminal."
1,Agonizing mumbling and whining...,"After reading so many great reviews for this CD, I could hardly wait to get it in the mail. I had, unfortunately, dismissed the few negative reviews that said things like ""I wanted to kill myself after listening to this CD""... whoever said that wasn't far off. I really do like the song cannonball (which is constantly played on the radio around here)... and there is one other that I like, although I can't quite remember the name (and I think it might be too soon for me to try to listen to the CD again to figure it out)... but most of the CD is filled with the unbearable sounds of this guy mumbling and whining... and the ENTIRE CD has a melancholy tone... it's just entirely unpleasant for me. I actually really enjoy whiny chick music though... maybe Rice is just missing some of that angst. I don't know what went wrong here... I might try it again in a few weeks... but for now I am definitely and overwhelmingly disappointed. :("
2,unoriginal and average,"This sounds like a guy with a sweet voice drew a dozen cliches out of a bag and used them as lyrics...the whole ""sit on my wall"" thing is painful. It sounds like bad poetry a 16 year old boy, who is drunk on cider, would write. Having said that he can sing and delicate is redeams the whole record. Maybe next time."
3,fantastic but uncomprimising talent,"Im not saying this record is good or bad but its just not for everybody. Damien Rice is good at what he does- the intimacy of Dylan, the emotion of Jeff Buckley and the sleaziness of Lou Reed all rolled into one sandwich.Maybe I should give this album more than 3 stars but being more of a rock fan i need something more epical and energetic than this. He's got buckets of songwriting and performing potential to be a legend but maybe he should consider plugging in his guitar now and again."
4,Surprise Hit,"I didn't think much of Volcano when I first heard it, but it gradually grew on me. After that, I fell in love with the rest of the album. I can't say I absolutely love, love, love every song on the album, but it comes close. Damien's lyrics and vocals touched me and made me smile, and I could listen to this album all day. Totally recommended."
5,just like a cloudy dawn,"in times like this where music gets more and more mechanical, boring,becoming a tool to make money;Damien Rice's great home made album ""o"" is a perfect escape.All those guitars,violins,vocals;lyrics;they're all bittersweet and so beautifull;that you'll feel like you are listening smtg so fresh,much more real than the crap you are used to see on mtv; and it'll make you desperately want to fall in love or love more if you're already fallen.t's like washing your face with cold water when you wake up to a cloudy,cool morning after a rainy night."
5,breathing in music and pain...,"Damien has a warm, calm, yet restless voice-it turns and winds up your own emotions and makes you face your own feelings of loss and inner confusion..'O' seems to tell: ""I'm still in love, but at the same time I'm in pain.."" what nicer way to say it than Damien's songs?"
2,snnnnnnore....,"There's been quite a bumper-crop of guitar-strumming/finger-picking, breathy-voiced, heart-on-their-sleeves, male singer-songwriters of late, all harkening back in one way or another to the original, Nick Drake. Damien Rice is, in my estimation, the bost boring of the bunch. Few things distinguish a song from any other one on the album. Most have the same tempos, arrangements, and melodic movement intended to be evocative of longing and melancholy. Even given the high quality of the sound, playing and whatnot, I think this is an awful album. I sincerely wish that folks would stop comparing Rice to Jeff Buckley. Jeff Buckley was an absolute genius, a man who could have been his generation's pop-Beethoven, but Damien Rice will be more or less forgotten within three to five years, with only a small core of fans to watch him when he plays small coffeeshops throughout the country, before he moves back to the UK to become a bank manager or something."
1,Overbearing,"The introspective singer songwriter has become nearly as common as the studio born popstar. So, it takes more than a few thoughtful lyrics, the ability to carry a tune and a sparsely strummed guitar to impress my ears.Rice's voice seems pleasant if not sweet at the onset, but midway through the album his often keening vocals grate on the nerves. The songwriting suffers from an overbearing sincerity and dirge like quality at times. The female vocalist and strings add to the overblown affair, creating a ""give me a break"" reaction, rather than the impassioned heart pull it strives to be."
1,"Never received item from Amazon, LLC","The one star isn't for Damien Rice, because I am familiar with his music and I enjoy it very much. This item was supposed to be a gift but it never arrived at its destination. I have given the shipment an ample amount of time to get there but after almost a month it is still in limbo. What makes it worse is that Amazon.com doesn't give you any real recourse for such a situation. I tried navigating all the areas in ""my account"", and there is no section that deals with lost goods."
5,One of the ten best CDs I Own (and I own a lot),"This is one of the best CDs I have heard in a long time. Damien Rice writes folk songs that drip with passion. He effortlessly combines his guitar work and expressive voice with strings and guest vocalists to create an entirely angelic album. The results are memorable in every song. The opener 'Delicate' is just that, with its crescendo at the end demonstrating the power that Rice can create. 'Cannonball' is probably my favorite, with its sad, soothing, yet somehow uplifting lyrics about dealing with life's difficulties. ""I Remember"" contains one of the few moments of fury in the entire album, and the epic closer ""Eskimo"" is a song about redemption and features an actual opera singer. This album approaches perfection, and I implore you all to check it out."
5,Love him,"damien rice is one of the best musicians, to say the least. this cd is brilliant and his voice and chemistry with lisa hannigan is amazing. one thing i do need to say is that if u ever get a chance to go to one of damien's shows - GO!! it is without a doubt the best show i have ever been to. i dont know how anyone else will top it. u would think its an acoustic setting and very mellow and chill....but it is the exact opposite, his songs come alive in concert and he adds drums and a base guitar and it sounds amazing...honestly everyone needs to go to one of his shows - it'll leave u breathless. so, buy this cd and go to his show, he is a brilliant."
5,lovely lovely lovely,This CD just wants to make you cry and give you more tears. Great album from start to finish. I wish I could find this CD as a record because I think it would come through to your heart even more than it does. Love it.
1,very small,"When I opened this I thought it was a miniature toy, if i had known this was so small I would have never ordered it. Its not big enough to make pesto or grind a lot of herbs just good for decoration."
4,"Adorable, colorful, fun set --must treat kindly, however.","I love this little mortar and pestle set so much that I can easily overlook it's drawbacks.First, I don't often use one for every-day cooking, so it's not constantly getting scraped-up, banged around, and scrubbed.Second, I don't have a large family so the size is not an issue when I do use it. It's perfect for my needs, and an eye-catching addition to my kitchen decor.For someone whose needs are greater, this may not be the way to go. It is small, and gets scratched-up easily."

2,I could almost make this w/ scraps from my garage.,"The cheapness of this wagon is apparent as soon as you open the box: It smells like spray paint and it did for many days after till I stuck it outside, for all I know it may still smell that way but I'm not bringing it back in the house. The wood(?) on the wagon is cheap and all chiped, big slivers were missing before I took it out of the box. And the flame sticker yes sticker, well I think you could find a better one in a gumball machine. I really would have sent it back if I didn't think it would have cost me half as much as the wagon. My advice, you can do alot better."
5,Oh wow! that is soooo awesome !!,bought this for my grandson and he absolutly loves it---he can haul stuff around the yard now just like his grandpa
3,Love The Wagon Just A few Little Things To Fix,"We bought this wagon for my sons 1st birthday we love the wagon and so dose he, there was a few problems, the flames where not on good we had to re-stick them, some of the nails came out of the sides and a few holes didn't line up. I didn't put it together i work for heating and air but they didn't have much problems. but for the price we paid it's a good wagon. My son loves his wagon, just had to do a few little things."
3,Where were the parts???,"We purchased this wagon for our 2yr son for Christmas and it was sent to my parents house. It came in a flat box and when my Dad went to put it together... He had the hardest time. There were many parts missing where he had to run down to the hardware store to find the missing pieces. Screws, pieces to put the tires on and he had to clue the sides together. They won't nailed properly. After doing all this the wagon looked pretty sharp and our Son loved it. He loved the flames on the side. We just wish it was easier to put together and it wasnt' missing any of the parts.sincerely,Fallon in California"
2,lijjat Papad,"I don't like this product at all. It tastes bitter and if that isn't bad enough, there is an after- taste."
1,Not as advertised,"I was completely unhappy with the item I received. This is a wooden item, not porcelain as advertised.. As such, it is only suitable for use as a decoration."
4,Porcelain? Really?,"I just received mine in the mail. It as beautiful as the picture...but I doubt it's porcelain. It's too light, and looks and feels like wood. I'm keeping it, but I respect truth in advertising."
3,Good for display only,"Well made and colours are gorgeous, unfortunately they are very very small; will just be a display rather than practical use"
4,Great for the money,"I bought this for my 12 year old so he could use it to crush up stuff for his ""experiments"". It is really small and cute. I think it was a fantastic deal for the money. I have not personally used it to crush herbs or meds so I do not know how functional the product would be."
2,"cute, but not very functional","It is pretty, but small and doesn't work very well. You would be better off getting a little bigger one that is heavier. The wood doesn't seem to be a very effective crushing tool."
4,Harold's Kitchen 3-1/2 Inch Round Mortar and Pestle,"It's very nice looking, but a bit small. I don't think it's to be used every day. Only for show."
2,just really pretty,I got this as a gift (from a local store charging more than double this price btw!) and I was so excited! Then I actually tried to use it. Poo-poo on that! It didn't work very well (the inside is very slick) and the spices just ended up scratching teeny flecks of paint/wood off into my blend!! Now it just sits there looking pretty... which is about the only use for it!--this has gotten worse over time. it looks like there was a coating of plastic over the wood which is now bubbling and peeling. gross - not something i want to eat!
1,would work well in a doll house,This is very tiny and would never work for my purpose -- will be adding to my kitchen decor not my kitchen tools
2,Cute but basically useless,"The color and patter is so cute, but it really serves no purpose unless it's for decoration. Unless you're a collector, or need a mortar and pestle for something VERY small, I would say move on."
2,This is not porcelain,"I gave this product a 2 because it is not porcelain as advertised. It is made of wood. I only use it for breaking up my cats pills, therfore I chose to keep it. If you need a morter and pestle for your kitchen or for multiple things I DON""T recommend this one.I did recieve this quickly and in good shape. I would have given this 4 stars had it been procelain"
3,Tiny and ineffective,This is truly more of a decorative Mortar and Pestle. Not sure why it sais Porcelain as it is all wood. Wood it turns out especially the light kind this is made of is not a great crushing or mixing tool. Definitely go with a stone Mortar and pestle. This is not worth the money... really.
4,Get what you pay for!,For $9.oo this little guy is great. The size is exactly what was discribed. I didn't need anything huge and it works perfectly for my purpose. This product is wood so I wash is with soft damp cloth and gentle cleaner drying with soft cloth immediatly after. doing this has prevented color from fading. I gave this only 4 stars because the colors are not as bright as in the picture of it.
5,Perfect visor-top atlas,"An excellent value. This collection of maps clearly depicts highways, towns (with population key), parks, points of interest, and colleges. It does not show railway lines and leaves out some very small towns, but in general it very thorough. The typeface is large enough to see easily even in dim light or while quickly glancing at a fork in the road. A lightweight reference tool, it offers a broad overview of New England's routes in a slim volume, for a bargain price."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"A collection of short books I didn't find very remarkable. If you get acheap bookclub edition or used, that is not so bad though."
2,"Entertaining Yes, Informing ... Well","This is a nice little book. It brings up some little known war stories, which should perk your interest. After reading this, you really should investigate the history must further. I found many of the items to be lacking in research. This is a great book if you use it as a spring board to dig deeper."
5,Great ground shrimp for sure!!!,"Great ground shrimp for sure!!!I ordered this fine product because I was having a difficult time finding it in stores, after I relocated from Los Angeles CA. to Orlando, FL.Mojave ground shrimp is an excellent ingredient in my seafood gumbo. I am so thankful this product is available thru Amazon.com."
4,Excellent but magnet in screwdriver broke after 3-4 uses,"I'm very pleased with the set. all pieces seem to be well-designed, comfortable to the hand (even with my big hands!!).Only bummer is the magnet that holds down the bits in the screw driver broke after 3-4 uses :/"
5,Good Quality,"this kit has great quality for that price, it is very useful and helpful, i use to fix any issue at home, great variety of tools"
1,Obviously a used set,"Every tool in the kit I received was obviously used, and I mean USED. There were dents and dings and all sorts of scuffs on them as if they had been used on some project before being returned. If I'm paying full price, I expect to receive items that are new or at least like new. If it was just one or two items I would understand, but basically every tool is used. I don't know who to really blame for it, but I am extremely unsatisfied and will probably be returning this item."
2,Screwdriver?,"Let me just start by saying that the biggest disappointment with this tool kit, is it's screwdriver.This tool kit comes with a adequate amount of bits, but no extension for the screwdriver.So trying to open any form of electronics with this kit will prove to be a pain.Clicking on the image that amazon provided will give you a indication of what i'm talking about.Secondly,why provide drill bits but no drill? It seems redundant to me.The rest of the tools are alright i suppose,but i would loved if they included a regular pair of pliers and do away with the drill bits."
1,Disappointed,"I bought this product 2 years ago because I was moving into my own apartment and needed a starter set. I hardly used it, maybe 3 times a year. I bought myself a new end table recently from amazon and had to assemble it. I pulled out this set. The main screw driver handle - the one that is used for ALL screw driver heads - just fell apart in my hand. I am left with a half assembled end table that I cannot finish.Now the entire Denali Tool Set is unusable. This set wasn't cheap (for me) and I very disappointed. I have no idea how to get a replacement handle-unit, I have been researching the Denali company and cant find anything - it is a dead end.If anyone has any suggestions or know how to get in touch with their service department, it would really help me out. I am a big fan of Amazon and their customer service, but this time - I feel let down."
4,good tool kit for the price,"This is a decent tool kit for the price. The 16oz hammer, level, tape measure, utility knife and the screw driver are my favorite. The masonry drill bit set is kind of crappy. The 3/16 one was broken after 10 second use. I might used it the wrong way. But another 3/16 masonry drill bit I bought from home depot survived. Overall, I would recommend the tool kit at $40."
4,Best buy ever,i am not kidding you when i say this is a rely able repair tool kit. It has every tool you'll need around the house on a bike or in general. When i first saw this the price scared me because it was to cheap. i researched this brand and asked my brother who works at Home-depot and he never heard of this brand. i wouldnt be surprise its a great buy for a low price. the only thing i would wish for is for a better saw its not as strong to handle big wood but i expected that. overall really good brand and dont regret buying it.
4,tool kit,"Awesome tool kit, it has pretty much everything you'll need for simple installations etc. Great price for what you get. However, some of the bits are duplicates, so I was wondering if it was this way in case some of them get lost, or if it was because that increases the number of pieces in the tool kit to make it seem bigger. There are no problems regarding the usage of any of the items in the kit, so I am overall happy with this purchase."
4,Denali Tool Kit,"This is a gift for a first time home buyer! It has all the basic things you need to turn nuts and bolts and turn screws, and drive nails."
5,Good value for a starter set,"I bought this for my daughter who is setting up a new apartment on her own. The tools in this set are ideal for furniture assembly, lamp fixing, picture hanging, etc. There is room in the bag to add more tools, so I hope this starts her on a lifetime of collecting handy tools. The drill bits are a bit of a mystery because no drilling tool is provided. Maybe I'll get her one for Christmas...."
2,Not that great!,"First off, the bag is awesome. Some of the tools (hammer, wrenches, allen wrenches,) are pretty nice. However, the first time I tried to use the screwdriver/socket wrench it shattered in my hand. I lowered the rating to a 2 star because of this. A lot of the pieces of this set are based off of that one tool.I would recommend this as a small starter kit, but go out and spend the money on a good set on real screwdrivers and socket wrenchs."
4,Tool Kit,"Not bad toolset, the best part of the kit is the bag. To be honest that is the main reason I brought the tool kit. It contains most tools you probably already have."
5,What a great product...,"I've inherited tools from my father and brothers, but they were ususally old and worn out. They needed to be replaced, but I didn't want to spend a lot of money doing it.I didn't think this tool kit would be too great for the price, but I thought this would get me by. I had no idea that I would be so impressed. This a very well gripped complete set of tools. Definitely worth the price - the bag is handy and keeps everything in one place - great for a disorganized person like me. Enjoy."
3,Ok product at great price,"Bought this as a gift based on the good reviews.PROS:1) Bag is nice -- keeps everything in one place.2) Assortment is good -- all the basics are covered.CONS:1) Would have been better if all the little pieces were contained in plastic holders (only the drill bits are).2) Everything is clearly marked ""Made in China"", which makes me question the quality, but it looks ok. The ""superglue"" holding the top on the hammer could have been mopped up better, and worries me a bitOverall, satisfactory -- but if you're picky about a high quality looking set, this isn't for you."
4,A good deal for the price,"I was looking for a starter tool kit for my daughter on her way off to college. I wanted a kit that covered a fair amount of territory, so she would have the basic things she would need for assembling, mounting, installing, and general small repairs. This kit fills the bill. The tools are diverse, useful, and good (not great) quality, and come in a convenient and durable bag that has room for extras. With a few minor additions (gotta have that duct tape) it is a good starter kit. The one complaint I have is that my order arrived with two torpedo levels and no utility knife. I could have returned it, I suppose, but I just bought a utility knife and added the extra level to my own tool inventory."
5,Great value!,"Wonderful product! This is an amazing value, these tools are not the ""fake cast"" metal you find in a cheap set, they are very well built and this set includes everything you'd ever need to maintain a small household or even for a business!!"
5,Great!,Just bought this hand tool kit and am very happy with it. My husband has one but it came in a plastic case that now doesn't hold the tools anymore and most of them are gone anyway. I can't fit any other hammers in the spot where the original hammer was so we can no longer keep them together. The bag this set came with is really nice. It also allows my husband the chance to lose most of these tools and allows me the flexibility to replace them. The hand tools and accessories that came in the case seem very nice and even professional grade. My husband said that they are even better then some of the Stanley tools he has.I went to Lowe's and saw that just the hammer alone was $10 and most of the individual hand tools were $7-10 a piece. I think I got a great deal and my husband thinks he got great tools. Best of both worlds.
3,Denali Tool Kit,"Please don't expect Sears craftman quality from this tool set. The tool bag is very good and the selection of tools is great. OK tool quality. As a tool kit around the home for newlyweds and college dorm it is excellent and the price is right. The hammer feels unbalanced because it has a hollow handle. The razor cutter is excellent because it is simple to open and change the blade. If I had my druthers, I would have omitted the drill bits (why did they include drill bits?) and put in a better hammer."
1,Short on quality,"This set seems nice at first and admittedly a couple of the tools feel durable. However, within a few weeks the bits have started to corrode (just sitting) and the ratcheting screwdriver is broken. The bag seems durable but the inner pockets are small and mostly useless. The allen wrenches are small and flimsy."
4,good for small projects,good deal for small projects around the house or car. drill bits fit into just about any drill. really can't complain.
3,"for DIYers, not professionals","i really liked this tool set untill i borrowed a friends Makita drill. wow, what a difference. its a nice starter kit for small household issues."
3,Decent basic tool kit,This was a gift for my husband. It is a good basic tool kit...nothing fancy...good for little things around the house. The case is nice and sturdy and the price was right.
3,it should have a drill...,"The only thing I didn't like so much about this product is that it didn't come with a drill or ratchet set. Other than that, this product is spot on for a father's day gift, a handy man's birthday gift and/or a house warming or college startup gift."
1,Didnt recieve all of my order!,"I had ordered this set for my boyfriend as a valentines day gift and it arrived on time, only HALF of it that is. I was sent double of some items and the rest was missing. As far as the quality goes, I suppose you get what you pay for. If anyone plans on using these tools all of the time I would invest in a better quality set, but if you only use them for rare fixings round the house then its fine. I am sending it back for refund and shopping for a better quality. I just wasted days and now Valentines day is even closer. Guess I will be shopping in a store."
1,Bad Quality ... Please Do Not Buy It !!,I reacive this iteam yesterday and i can say one thing :Too Bad Quality ToolsIf you want to use something strong and heavy duty don`t take DENALI TOOLSgo for other brands ..
3,Disappointing,"This set has a nice assortment of tools, and is a great set for those who don't know where to start, but the quality of the tools is a concern. One of my favorite things about this set was the ratcheting screw driver. Unfortunately, after only a couple normal uses, the thing fell apart. Little pieces of the screw driver scattered to the ground, and could not be reassembled. I've since thrown it away. Everything else in the bag is fairly standard. Nice bag. Nice organization, but I'm concerned about the quality. Good set for the price, just disappointed that the most useful piece in this set was such a piece of junk."
5,Compact and cool,"Everything you need (almost) in one compact package. Everything stores in a myriad of pockets in the duffel carryall, with room for your other ""I need this"" tools. Also includes stuff for your power drill (bit sets),if you have a one. A great deal."
3,Good Starter Tool Set,"I purchased this set for my 20 year-old son as he sets out in the world, and also so he stops ""borrowing"" my tools. It has a good collection of tools, most that would be needed in basic home repair. The screwdriver comes with just about all the different tips needed these days, which is nice. The hack saw blade with handle is nice. It can be used in those tight spaces.It also came with drill bits, but no drill. This was odd. So the next item needed is a good cordless drill.I judge this set on the hammer, the most basic and often used tool in existance. The call it heavy duty, but it has a fiberglass handle. This is an oxymoron as no hammer can be heavy duty with a fiberglass handle. Fiberglass can break. Be careful using this for anything other than putting small nails into light wood. Metal handled hammers are the preferred hammer. Actually, as I think about it, one should throw this thing away and buy a good Estwing hammer."
4,Good For The Value,Ordered them at Black Friday. It has very nice sturdy pieces. The only flaw I found is that some pieces have rust on them; i.e. the small drill bits.
1,Poor quality,"Product arrived as per schedule. However I was very disappointed with the Quality of the tools. Some of the items were broken. Some of them were soaked with oil. Packed stuff back on the same day. I am glad I purchased from Amazon for hassel free return and credit. I bought Craftsman from Sears though it cost me twice, I am satisfied with this replacement."
4,good quality,received this tool set as a gift and so far have been very happy with it. the tools included seem to be very good quality.
4,Denali Tool Kit,"Nice tools, really like the razor knife, spring loaded and hinged, no more looking for the screw. Hammer is a nice weight and well made. All in all happy with the product EXCEPT FOR........... in the bag there are pockets to put things in, but no way for me to really keep everything together, I can see it being a loose bag of different tools. Should have some storage compartments or little boxes, something to organize with."
3,Good set but bad cutting pliers,"It really have a lot of tools, but it brought ""Drill bits"" just to force you to buy their drill, but my big problem is that the cutting plier get bad without using it."
4,Good tools but poorly organized in the bag.,"So far i have liked the tools and quality of the tools. My only gripe is the bag. First, the quality of the bag is not great. I have already ripped a few of the inside pockets. Secondly and most importantly, when all the tools are placed in the bag there is no organization scheme. To get to tools normally have to empty most of the bag. The hammer also get in the way of putting things in to the inside pocket.I would recommend the tools just not the bag and its organization of the tools."
3,Cheap screwdriver - straps already broke,"Sure, it comes with 115 pieces, and I'm only unhappy with two of them, but those two items are worth a 2-star drop off from the best 5-stars.The screwdriver is cheap and flimsy. Its the type that lets you set a direction (in or out buddy), but it often loses that setting mid-use and goes back to being a ""normal"" screwdriver. A screwdriver is a man's best friend in the toolbox - this one I will have to replace.The bag itself is convenient, and has plenty of room for your toys. My over-the-should strap broke after a week, though. That was a shame, but they give you 4 hooks as if to say, ""1 broken out of 4 ain't bad!""I am content with this purchase, but I would not make it again."
2,Cheap tools,I got them today and already had trouble with few of the tools due to poor quality and workmanship. When you buy a tool and the bolt on one of pliers looks like it's been hammered in incorrectly (looks half broken). The Exacto knife had to be opened and reset (mechanical parts poorly made inside!. The set lacks a regular size pliers. The adaptable screwdriver is made for small hands and the philips is even smaller. Most of the 115 pieces are bit parts for a missing drill. This set is basically a toy. The best piece seems to be the hammer.Not really worth the money!
2,Doesn't Keep Foods Hot,I bought these for my 3 kids to send foods to school. I put boiling water in them for 10 minutes before I add their hot food. By lunchtime their food is cold. I'm in the process of looking for something that'll work better.
1,"Boring, boring, boring...","It's really a ""Playgirl"" type of photography. The guys are diplaying pecs and abs and even more than that but, still, it's not worth it, they look so straight! Also the book is very small so have your magnifying lense ready. My advice is: browse through it at your local B&M bookstore but don't waste $35.00."
1,bang !!! zooooooommmmmmmmm,and away it goes!!!!!!!!!not worth the money when i can get the whole set for 22 dollars just another way of making money..rx doc!!!!
2,I don't get it.,"There are only 39 episodes. Why would I buy eight of them for $12, when I can buy all 39 for $27?"
4,"The Basket, Amazon verified purchase. DVD",The depiction of the struggle of a German immigrant child to be accepted by a small town community during WWII is moving and relevant to similar struggles today. The photography of the Palouse country in SE rural Washington is stunning! The acting was excellent.
1,The shots are nice!,"The storyline? Dull. The characters? Under-developed. The verdict? Don't waste your money buying it. It's a one-time renter at the most. The shots are nice and set a certain mood, but the painful dialogue and the german accents will make you cringe. If you liked any made for tv movie ever made, then you'll love this."
1,factually inaccurate and grating,"Many folks have praised the historical accuracy of this film. I question the whole factual basis of the film, did 1. Americans kill civilians in Germany, and 2. Was there sufficient time and reason for German orphans to have been brought to America before the War's end?America didn't enter the War 'til 1917, and, from my reading, the Allies did not even penetrate Germany before Armistice in November 1918For me, this film grates on many levels. One of those is the repetitive Wagnerian musical score and fictional German opera. Could such a choice of an opera comport with a teacher's, never mind community, sensibilities of the time?Was the farmer's supposedly outmoded harvester so advanced in that day as to be beyond the skills of the American farmer nor his grown sons?And while facing an American flag, to which flag was the young German pledging allegiance?This film can be compared to the far more polished 'Snow Falling on Cedars'"
4,wonderful story,"""The Basket"" is a beautifully written movie. So deep that it's hard to sum up. It's about basketball. It's about opera. It's about war. It's about orphans and new immigrans. It's about a farmer and his wife coming to terms with the death of their son from the war. It's about a town overcoming their prejudice. It's about a stranger changing a small town.It's about hope. A young German boy is bullied by the town boys and made to feel unwelcome by the town. The boy overcomes by having a goal--not fighting back with evil, but defeating evil with good.I watched it with my 8 year-old nephew and he identified with the boy being bullied. My 12-year old niece came in during the basketball game and quickly got caught up in the story--wanting to know if Brigitta marries the Emery boy."
3,"Good movie, not historically flawed","I thought it was a nice family friendly film. However, the movie implies that the German orphans lost their parents due to American soldiers shooting them in the heat of battle in what is implied to be a German town. Outside of some Russian units who entered the far Eastern territories of Germany at the start of the war, no allied troops, American or otherwise, ever set foot on German soil in World War One, unless they were prisoners. Also, a letter the teacher sends to his associate in Boston, is postmarked November 23, 1918, when in fact the context of the movie suggests that the war is still on (the Armistice took effect earlier in November, 1918) during this scene.Also, a nice change of pace in that the German characters in the movie are actually positive, likeable people. Generally, thats not the case in war movies."
1,Some fine tuning,I came across The Basket in a video store and decided to rent it. This was my first mistake. My second mistake was watching it. I did find amusement in ripping on the characters with a few friends. Seems like the movie could have went through a little more fine tuning before they threw it to the home viewers. Some very nice scenery at times though. It's a one-renter.
4,The best film of 2000 that you didn't see,"Starring Peter Coyote and Karen Allen, The Basket tells the story of a new schoolteacher in Waterville, Washington during World War I. He uses the unlikely subjects of opera and the new game of basketball to help two sibling German orphans who are facing discrimination by others in the town. The film is at once a drama, a sports film, and has some light-hearted moments. It is a wholesome and uplifting film.The production quality is superb and the scenery is quite breathtaking. The film also contains an original soundtrack, produced in part by individuals from Spokane.This is a film which all ages can enjoy. The basketball game's final scene is a moving display of sacrifice you won't soon forget."
4,A REAL FUN TREAT FOR HORROR FANS !,As a horror film junkie i can't help but have a sweet-tooth for this goofy hoax/homage to great low-budget horror films of the 70's such as'THE LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT(1972)''SLAUGHTER HOTEL(1973)''DON'T LOOK IN THE BASEMENT(1973)''TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE(1974)''PIGS(1973)''I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE(1977)' & 'THE HILLS HAVE EYES(1977)'. I truly enjoyed this little gem & in my opinion if this film was really made back n tha day it would not only had fit in perfectly it would've stood out as one of the better cult classics of that era with out a doubt! So it seems that Vin Crease n tha gang acomplished exactly what they set out to acomplish & i for one appreciate & applaud them for horror fans makeing a horror movie for horror fans. Excellent film!
2,"All art house, trippy, visionary, inspired, and 'AHEAD OF ITS TIME'","Too bad it's from 3 years ago.I'm giving it two stars only because it was one star better than the one stars I've watched recently. Don't bother with this one. When I thought it was from the seventies, I stopped asking questions. When I found out it's actually from 2005, I laughed. Watch the special features, and see how ridiculous they actually get with the side-story...*Hands up in the air* DONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,oh if i could only give it zero,"do you remember all those terrible 70s horror movies that made no sense and didn't even attempt coherent plot lines? well the directer of this movie got the bright idea to emulate this long dead(and rightfully so) style. he pawned it off as being a ""long lost classic"" and concocted some story about vehicular hommicide to explain its lostness. it was really just made last year. this is a terrible rehash of ideas that were terrible to bigin with. its not even humerously bad. its just intentionaly bad. sickenngly boring and the acting is beyond medeocre, and its all done on purpose. its movies like these that make people dislike indipendant film."
3,Bland,"Don't believe the hype. This disk got a handful of good reviews, mostly from people wishing Jason and the Scorchers would put out another decent album. This isn't awful, but why bother? The songwriting is weak, and even Jason's voice (lilting my rear end) sounds wimpy."
4,"Not balanced, but an intriguing look","Of course, Giuliani peetered out in his run for the White House, which came after this 06 release. So, if the filmmakers were trying to send a warning that he was the next Hitler, then it was all for naught. People do forget that the mayor was quite unpopular right before 9/11, which this film makes clear. He may have made some mistakes, but it's hard to condemn the crime downturn associated with his tenure, even if the same thing was happening elsewhere at the same time. Well worth watching even though Giuliani seems to be toast."
5,Satire at it's best,"As a white female teacher in a mostly black area, I often discover that the students are the worst stereotypers of each other. They call intelligent well-spoken kids ""whitey,"" and often try not to see that there is value in education and knowledge. Ralph Wiley shows intellect, a gift of satire, and gets into their heads to vocalize what many feel but can't say. I teach his essays in English and encourage my students to use them in dramatic reading competitions, ""freaking out"" the middle class kids who also attend. My students and I admire his honesty, wit and in-your-face attitude. He not only ""calls out"" whites, but blacks who hold themselves down and who hold down others as well. As they remind me, he ""keeps it real!"""
4,Very thought provoking!,"While members of ITCOMS did not agree with all of Mr. Wiley's ideas, we could not stop taking about the book. The book raises questions that need discussion. Maybe that is what the book is all about: raising awareness, thinking along different lines, and talking and exchanging ideas."
1,A Poor Writer Spreads Hateful Conspiracy Theories,"Understandably defensive about his unfocused and rambling writing style, the late Ralph Wiley used his limited talents to lower the standard of discourse on race relations in America. Wiley's various conspiracy theories, which comprise the bulk of ""Why Black People Tend To Shout,"" don't withstand scrutiny, and they offer no solutions. His book has value only as a sociological example of one African American male's mindset in the late 20th century. The most accurate review comes from a paraphrasing of Wiley's own words: ""A very unoriginal human being, this [Ralph Wiley]. Poisoned by the deciders in his youth, he learned his hate, and also learned how to pass off his own inadequacies on other people. If he didn't get something, it was somebody else's fault, not his. [Ralph Wiley] didn't leave such thinking behind in the seventh grade, like most everybody else. He had hit upon a business."""
2,cracked and loose lid...,"Although my chinchilla really enjoys his ball--he goes like crazy all over the family room banging into things and chasing our cat. However, because the plastic is weak, the lid fits very loosely and my 'chilla bangs into everything, the lid came off (even with scotch tape reinforcement) and our family room became Wild Kingdom as the 'chilla was loose and our cat was on the chase. Everyone survived the excitement and now the lid gets reinforced with packing tape when he wants to run about. I haven't had much luck finding another design or manufacturer with a better quality product."
1,Terrible.,The lid of the ball did not properly align with the ball. So when my rabbit ran in this ball the lids came off and the rabbit escaped. This ball was poorly made and I would not recommend this product to anyone else.
2,Ball was cracked,This arrived in a box that was too small and therefore had 3 small cracks in it. Our adult prairie dog would not use it. Only cried when we tried to get her to try it.
4,Exercise ball,"I purchased this for my daughter's guinea pig, but he won't run in it. We have to roll it for him. Think twice if you intend to get it for a guinea pig.I had a smaller one in the past for my hamster and he loved it. The ball is excellent quality. It just is not suitable for a guinea pig, but it is large enough and he has plenty of room in it. Maybe other guinea pigs are more energetic?"
2,Thin plastic and lid doesn't stay on.,I purchased the ball for my chinchilla and the first time I used it the lid fell off. I do have another ball and with the new ball the plastic is thinner and the lids don't lock in place. I have had to duct tape it shut when she is in it.
3,Question: Can I fit my head in this thing?,"I am a grown male with an averagely sized head.My question to owners of this device is thus:""What are the odds I can fit my head inside this thing and wear it like a space helmet?""Thanks."
1,Very dangerous and even DEADLY for Chinchillas! Do NOT buy!,"It never fails to make me rage that the manufacturer will advertise this product as being ""for chinchillas,"" especially since it seems like such a great idea at first. However, this product is deadly for chinchillas, who can overheat very easily due to their thick fur and poop constantly (so they would be rolling around in their own urine and feces). Among chinchilla owners it is known as the ""ball of death""-- please, do a quick search on this product and the extreme dangers it poses to chinchillas before even thinking about purchasing."
1,Cheap.Cheap. Cheap,"Arrived with two of the four plastic tabs broke. Made from very cheap plastic. Dont waste your money, not worth it."
2,13 inch exercise ball,"I opened the box as soon as the ball came in, and it was covered in cracks! I had to go buy 4 tubes of superglue to fix all the cracks in it!! Plus, one of the tabs on the lid was broke!! I would say this is a good price for the product, but considering how many cracks were in it, it's not!!!!"
3,Problems with cap locks,"This ball contains two locks on the polar sides of the ball to let chinchilla in (and out) . Very soon they lost their shape, became corrupted and now it's not as easy to lock chinchilla in as before.I do not like the product from this manufacturer for this reason (corruptable plastic)"
4,SEE size in person BEFORE buying!,This product is so necessary for your caged pet to get exercise! However you should see the size ball you think you need in person. Although you know the inches it seems larger in person. We are not sure if its easily damaged or if it wasnt packaged well. Ours arrived with quite a few nicks and scratches!
3,Could Have Been A Good Product...,"But... It arrived broken.Even if it was not in pieces, I could tell the plastic was not very sturdy, and the lid did not fit right (notches would not slide in the slots right, the plastic was warped and ovular at the exit, not round, making the lid fall out easily and letting my chinchilla roam free). We taped it together to the best of our ability but it was a waste, we eventually asked for our money back and bought a more sturdy (unbroken) ball at our local pet store.The clear is great though, our chinchilla really likes being able to see rather than having a purple or yellow one."
3,the cap could be improved,The material does that the little braces that lock the cap into the ball breaks very easy during the transport. And it's complicated to open and maintain the cap in it's place during the usage.Besides that its a good product and you'll get much funny seeing your pet exercising.
3,It's okay,"The ball is okay except when you put the lids on, the ball i a little off so they don't fit perfect. Other then that have no problem except my critter isn't so sure about it yet, but she will get there."
3,"nice BIG ball, but","the lid keeps coming open. I am kinda afraid to let my rat stay in the ball unsupervised. I do like the size though, as does the rat!"
2,misleading photo,"The bridge pins in the photo look perfect with a shiny white mop inlay but mine were brown and dull from what looks like glue holding them in place.D'Andrea Tone Pins Brass Bridge Pin Set, Mother of Pearl"
4,Great bridge pins!,"I'm sure the mother-of-pearl is of the thinnest veneer on this, but it really doesn't matter, does it? These bridge pins look good when new, and I must stress the new part. After a year and a half of pulling them out and back in, the gold finish has worn off, leaving a cheap looking silver finish underneath. Aside from this, you really can't beat these pins.. and only for around $10!They add a high-end response, as well as improved dynamics throughout, and do improve sustain. I am quite happy, these are an upgrade from both plastic and wood bridge pins.. have not had bone ones, so I wouldn't know, but I would think these have a more trebly sound.All in all, get these bridge pins, for the price, the tonal upgrade cannot be beat!"
2,These don't fit every guitar,"The taper angle on these is not correct for my Dean, so they did not work as intended."
4,Brain Tumors (Cancer research),"This book is one I will keep until I am in remission for a very long time. It is more to the technichal side, but very informative. For me to purchase my next book specific to Glia Cells and the greater function they have than nuerons! Good book for you shelf of self inquiry! I wish anyone going through brain cancer or any cancer would read the books and know how very far we are away from understanding things like the brain!"
3,One outta three,"I purchased this DVD for the original widescreen version of ""The Last Man On Earth"".The other two movies are whatever. For $5.00 I won't complain. The Satanic rights of dracula is not for children. It was watchable with popcorn but I doubt I would ever view it again. If you have been looking for the Vincent Price movie in it's original format this is the version at the right price."
5,leadsinger musikartridge for karaoke microphone,"Being familiar with this kind ofr product for the last several years, I have nothing contrary to say about it. I love it!"
5,Great Hot Cereal,"I used to eat this hot cereal during winters as a kid. My mother made it with whole milk, honey, and margarine or butter. Yum! Now, 40+ years later, I still find this a wonderful winter morning treat. Now, I add 1% milk and honey, and skip the margarine/butter. Still tastes great! Funny, I've tried Cream of Wheat, which I can find easily in any supermarket, but don't really like it. Cream of Rice has gotten harder and harder to find in supermarkets. So, I'm pleased to find it available via Amazon!"
4,Fun compliation,An enjoyable cd full of music which captured an overlooked era of british music in between punk/alternative music of the early 80's and britpop of the 90's.
3,It's a useful book,"I think I know a little bit about literature circles already... but it wasn't anything groundbreaking to me. I guess what I was looking for is maybe some evidence (anectdotal or otherwise) that would show how great Lit circles are (for elementary learning). I envision a class where the language arts program revolves around ""book club"" type activities... cuz I'm not really in love with the whole 'read-from-the-anthology', traditional way (as the basis for LA instruction). I think it's boring a lot of the time--for both student and teacher.So in that regard, while I still thinks it's a book that has value... I don't think it was a MUST read."
2,I expected more...,"Hi. In my opinion, if you are interested in looking at a lot of great photo's of direct mail and someone telling you some pretty obvious stuff like, ""Plan ahead!"" or ""Think Big!"" then this is for you. I was very disappointed at the lack of ""GUIDE;"" for example, one chapter notes, ""Pay attention to postal regulations..."" and then never talks about ANYTHING regarding them! I found that the elements missing were: identifying industry standards like package names, sizes, etc; a glossary of direct mail terminology; and especially what to expect pricewise. Overall, not for me or anyone desirous of actually learning something about direct mail."
4,Lessons from the Gypsy Camp,It's an easy read with interesting character development and good descriptive detail. It also offers proof that perservernce pays off and that good pervails over evil.
5,Listen to our youth.,The lessons within are many and humbling. Readers learn that children are often our best judges due to their innocence. They don't allow preconceived notions to get in the way of love. Journey with a young gal who shares the heart of a person has nothing to do with their social standing. A lovely book for all ages. A perfect read for middle and high school youth to learn that standing up for what you believe in has glorious rewards.www.boomerwomenspeak.com
3,"Good story ,not original music score,disappointed","It is a concise version of a famous animation series of the 70's,too bad the English dub does not use the original music score."
1,Did not get it!,Did Not get the bit so I can't review it. They did't send it or the post office ate it.
3,Inflatable clogs,"If your feet are not big enough or sweaty enough.....these are the shoes for you.....also, buy yellow like I did cause everyone want to see your big feet."
3,"Not bad, Maui Revealed Much Better","This is a pretty decent book, with some good information and tips on the island. The post it not tabs are nice to mark information you want easy access to. Some of the icons (heads up, kid friendly etc) are also helpful. Beware - there is some word for word duplication with the Frommers book.For anyone traveling to Maui, this is a decent resource. But the ultimate is Maui Revealed."
2,Big Mistakes,"Two of the biggest mistakes I've ever made were buying this book and the Maui Revealed. They both were smooshy and fuzzy and didn't at all help me find anything other than the popular sites where EVERYONE and I mean EVERYONE from Arkansas to Missoula to Hoboken to Dallas go. Get me away from the white sock crowd!!My advice is to research Maui on the internet before (the hotels especially} you go and buy a few maps so you can understand the road system. If you like to surf, book a hotel near Paia. The Haiku area is real nice."
2,It's ok,"I have both this book and Revealed and by far I recommend the Revealed book. This book is ok to use as a companion guide with Revealed, but I did not find it nearly as helpful. I mainly bought the Dummy book to see if I could get a different point of view about sites, restuarants, etc. and I did in some cases, but I will be using the Revealed book as my main guide when I go back to Maui this year."
5,Nice Cut,Needed this to match the profile of an existing kitchen cabinet. Nice cut with very little sanding. You need to remove the protective oil layer from the cutter to get a clean cut.
3,Works Ok,"Using it for my Windows phone and while it does charge the phone, its quite slow...If Im playing music or using some other battery intensive process, the charger cant keep up.."
1,Does not charge my Blackberry Bold,"Does not work at all. I bought this to change my blackberry in the car. It will not change the device. This ""charger"" is useless to me."
5,Works,I've had this thing plugged in pretty much since I bought it. Nice to have this usb power supply in my car when I need it. Good product.
4,Simple and the right price,Got here quicker than the scheduled time so that was a bonus. The packaging was nothing special. Just a bag with the charger in it but hey I figure if they save on the packaging then I don't have to pay for it so its a win win situation. The thing is lightweight and does what it says. For the price you can't beat it. I was thinking of going with a Belkin or more known name but then thought its all the same stuff in the end. So spent the $4 on the product and its worked out perfectly since I got it. The only thing I would like to see different is that the lights be a slightly different color. The red is very hard on the eye's at night but not bright enough or dark enough necessarily for the day light. It really isn't a problem cause it works as you'd expect. Just a personal preference.
1,"~*~*~*~*RIP OFF , NEVER WORKED ~*~*~*~*~","I decided to give this a try, Got the item and pluged it in my vehicle and NEVER WORKED albeit I tried to double check on my wife's vehicle ( in case my plug was bad ) just flashes red and doing nothing ..went ahead and bought one from Walmart which worked just fine ..I took the thing apart to find out bad wire joint ...SO CHEAPLY MADE ,You get what you pay for ..STAY AWAY"
2,hit and miss,"When i plug it in to charge my iphone or shuffle, it will only work when it wants to. when it does work it charges just fine and doesnt spark or explode *not kidding* like other cheaper adapters i have usedshould have just bought a little more expensive one- you get what you pay for"
1,Not satisfied,I bought 2 and I'm really not satisfied. You really have to play around with the connections to get it to charge and then you have to keep checking it to see if it is still working and start the process all over again if not. This is not covenant or safe when your driving...
1,piece of crap,"if you are buying this to charge an ipad 2 it will not work dont waste your money, i tried both ports but it still wouldnt charge dont waste your money......"
5,Fantastic,This was more than I could have expected the functionality is just what was need for mobile support in application of USB options on the go...thanks!
1,Does not work,This does not work.It had a burnt electrical smell the first time I plugged it in. I have tried both ports and tried puting it in different car charging spots and no luck!
1,Poor Qualti,"I bought this, and the first one didnt even work, then I contacted the company and sent me another one, that worked for about a day, and now no longer works."
2,Works but makes a little high pitch sound when connected,It does the job but there is a high pitch sound that is very annoying when it's connected. Other than that it's an okay product for the price.
1,Don't waste your money,"If there was a way to give them a negative rating, I would. I ordered two of these items and neither of them worked. It wasn't worth dealing with because of their very low price, so I wrote it off as a learning experience. I tried them with multiple functionable cables, in three different vehicles, with two different Apple devices, and could not get any power to my devices at all."
1,Doesnt work,Purchased two of these for me and my wife's Iphones as a backup and both didnt work what a waist of time.
1,Didn't work,This item did not work with our iphone or ipod touch. We plugged into the proper outlet in our car and properly connected it to each device and it did not work at all.
2,Invest your money in a better Item,"I recived this product on time. For the price the material looks as I spected.When I try it in my car, it dint work.Better spend your money in a more expensive working device.Be carefull for cheap priced chargers, this is not the first one that I bought that doesnt work."
1,Didn't work,"Unfortinately this product did not work when I received it. It would not charge at all. I'm not sure if mine was an isolated defect, but I just know mine doesnt work..... Disappointed..."
3,So-so charger,"I bought two. One worked and the other didn't. Since they were pretty inexpensive, I didn't mind, but I would not buy these again."
1,Broke very quickly,"Item broke on the first time that I used it. I never tried to contact the deal, item seemed cheap and was cheap to buy, not worth the time to try to get money back over, just shop someone else."
1,Worked a few times,Would not work at all in one car. Worked a few times in other car. Better products are out there.
1,Stopped working,"I had this product for probably a week and it already died, i plugged it into my car one night and it would not even light up"
3,Looks good,"Have been unable to use this product but it doesnt look cheap. Looks like so far well worth the money. As far as its function, as of right now I am still unaware."
3,Works great....super snail shipping.,"Took entirely too long to get here. I know it came from China and all, but there's no reason for it to take a month to arrive. Otherwise, it works great."
1,I hate this item,This item only worked for like two days then only one of the USB plug worked then it just stopped working.
1,uhmm,When I reccived this mine did not work? I never returned it only because it wasnt that much money and I dont feel like going threw the hasslle I might have just got a dud one or it broke in delivery or something idk but the red light comes on but it docent charge my phone ipad ipod nothing so im positive that its broken and not my device or my car because everything is new and I have had no problems with anything else before so it HAS to be this product.
2,Charge or play - but not simultaneously,"Works fine as a charger. However, with my iPod classic there is a high pitched squeal when I listen while this charger is plugged in, due to inadequate power supply filtering. This is not the only make/model on the market with this problem -- my quest to find one that doesn't squeal continues."
1,JUNK,These things are junk. I bought two and they are poorly designed and cheaply made. They stopped working within TWO MONTHS!!!!
1,Stopped working,"After a week it stopped working, red light still works but doesn't charge.I have nothing else to say but Amazon feels necessary to require me to write 20 words when 3 will do. It doesn't work."
3,You get what you pay for,This product works fine and it is nice to have two USB ports in my car. The product doesn't seem like it is particularly sturdy though and I don't expect it to hold up long term. The price was right though.This product took about a month to ship to me.
4,Few problems with this adapter over a year of use,"I have owned two of this product for over a year, and have had very few problems. The ones I received are black, unlike the white one pictured. They also have an indicator light for when they are working.I have used this to charge a few LG phones, camera, iPod, iPad, and many other USB devices. Sometimes it requires a little pushing and adjusting to get the device to charge, but the springs on the side keep it in place once it's settled correctly."
2,Charger,Shipped fAst but this charger doesNot work as described it will not charge tried in teo different vehicles disappointed
3,Took forever,"Took a while to get my product, considering it came from china. Works like its supposed to although it feels cheaply made like it could easily break."
1,Dont waste your time,"I figured what the hell ill give it a shot since it was cheap and my droid would be easier to charge in my car, i was wrong. I doesnt work at all so all you are paying for is a piece of plastic that does nothing."
1,This Product Does Not Work At All,I received this product in the mail a couple days ago. It felt a little hollow but I decided to try it out anyways. When I plugged my car charger in my car it did not work at all. I ended up throwing it away since it was $2 and more money to send it back for a refund.
5,Great tool for the road,"This is a lifesaver for road trips and sales people who spend a lot of time in the car! Great product, price and seller!"
1,Hate it,Does not wok unless you hold it in with your hand. I have tried it in three different cars and it sucks!
4,Unbelievable for the price,"This charger works absolutely fine so far. First I couldn't believe the price, then I bought it by taking a chance to see what happens, it works great for the price."
2,Addition to my last review,I guess I did not read all the reviews carefully. I thought this would be a good charger for charging two devices at one time on road trips. It did not charge my Samsung BlackJack phone. It does charge my bluetooth and my daughter's IPhone. I guess I will have to continue to look for a similar charger. I can say I received the product over a week ahead of schedule.
2,Built cheap!,"This is built very cheaply. I've only used it twice because it doesn't stay in. When the car is on a bumpy road, it works it's way out."
4,Definitely recommend,It works exactly like it's supposed to. I read a lot of bad reviews and was a bit wary but I'm glad I bought it!!! Smaller than I thought it would be (that's a plus).
5,"Great Little Charger, Works Very Well","This works great, charges both of my phones up no problem and quickly too. Sturdy construction. I recommend this for anyone looking for something similar. So far so good!"
1,Did not work even after modifications,"seemed like an ok product when i got it. after plugging it in my cigarette lighter it immediately blew the fuse in my car. after tinkering i realized the problem was it had too much exposed metal around the tip, so any side to side movement caused it to short out inside the cigarette jack. i fixed this by wrapping it in electrical tape. so now it works and the red led lights but once i try to charge my phone (htc incredible) it repeatedly turns on and off trying to charge the phone, which in turn makes the phone unusable while it is plugged in. this device claims to deliver 5VDC 1A but my guess is the current is about half that. i cant even imagine what would happen if i tried to plug to devices into it."
1,Very poorly constructed,"It worked great until it started falling apart repeatedly (it only took a couple of months of very rare use), and eventually it was responsible for a blown fuse in the car. At this point I'm not sure I want to risk using it, for the sake of the electronics, and the car."
1,Works TOO good! Battery destruction and other fun!,"I received the 2 port USB car charger a week ago and have just gotten a chance to try it out. At first everything seemed to working well with it. It charged my Fiance's Samsung Moment extremely fast... almost...too fast. It went from 28% to 100% in about 4 minutes! I was amazed! Then I thought about the damage that can cause and quickly unplugged the phone from the charger. I was unfortunately too late. Her battery is now ruined and I need to buy a new one. This charger achieved the incredible charge rate by over-volting. This is extremely dangerous for delicate electronics such as cell phones, gps, tablets, ya know, things this charger is apparently designed for. Sadly her phone no longer holds a charge and you can watch the battery gauge drop 10% a second as soon as its unplugged from a good charger. Next time I will buy a quality name brand charger for something expensive such as cell phones. Lesson learned."
1,Very bad,Very bad. Did not work at all. Took a chance given the price. No luck...I do not recommend this though it's low price
2,don't really have a good quality.,"this product doesn't have a good quality. it won't charge nicely. you'll have to move the cord to a direction to let it charge. i wouldn't recommend this product to others. i think it's kind of a waste of money. overall, fast shipping."
4,Smaller but big with personality,"Exactly as described. My sister had one of these, but it was bigger and took up too much room around the console. This was a less expensive style, smaller, yet perfectly sized for my car and did the same job. I can plug two items in it at once and it was at an absolutely fantastic price. I am happy with my purchase."
4,Good one,"Its working and its good, I am using this since last 7 months.. and it is still working like new :-)"
5,great product,"I am very pleased with this product, I bought it for my electric cigarette the one that the electric cig company was selling was very expensive but this was such a good deal and a great product thank u"
2,not a good fit,"This adapter doesn't fit my cigarette lighter tightly enough. It won't charge unless I push the usb wire towards the adapter, and prop something against it to make it push in and stay. Other than that it charges well."
1,Sucks,"Item took twice as long as stated to arrive, and doesn't work. I guess that's the gamble on cheapo items. Don't buy"
1,DO NOT BUY,"I recently purchased 2 of these chargers and neither of them work at all. Luckily it was only 6 bucks for 2 of them so it wasn't a big loss. This is the first problem I've had with Amazon so its kinda disappointing. Anyway, I don't recommend purchasing these chargers cuz they don't work at all."
2,Tempted by price,I was a little too tempted by the price and shouldn't be surprised it didn't last more than two months. It works fine while it works but is very fragile. Considering the price it's what you should expect.
2,Sirleo,Got two of these a few weeks ago one worked good the other cuts in and out and never charges.
3,to charge two devices,"I tried to use this to charge two devices at the same time - an iphone 4s and a battery case for the same iphone - now to this product's defense I later found the batter case to be defective and flawed so maybe it was more that case than this product but after using both USB slots at the same time i suddenly smelled melting/hot plastic, and unplugged everything, this thing no longer works with an devices plugged in."
2,Short term use,"I bought my children iPod Touches for Christmas(2011)and wanted to make sure they could charge them in car if need be so I bought this product. The price was wonderful and the fact that it was a duel charger, so I only had to buy one, was really nice too, however it has only been used a handful of times since then and in less than 6 months it has already stopped working.....bummer :("
1,Not a good one,The car charger does not work. I tried it many times and on different cars. I did not return it cause it cost more to return than what I paid for. Perhaps that is what this seller was hoping for. He sold a useless product and knew people would not return it due to postage.
1,Did not work,"Complete junk. Didn't work, tossed it. I would not order this again. It was cheap and I thought it would be ok as an extra charger, but we could not use it at all."
1,haven't received,its been five 5 weeks and i still haven't recived this product from this company. How am i to review a product that i haven't received. This is taking longer than anything that i have purchased.
1,Not compatible with iProducts,My wife ordered this for iPhone/iPad use. It is only a 5 volt charger and is not suitable for any I Products since all iPhones/iPads require a 10volt charge. Don't waste your money as these units can actually cause damage to your equipment.
1,don't buy,"this charger makes a noise that is not noisy but loud enough to bother me. it did not charge my blackberry curve 3g. it charged my ipod nano 5th generation once, then fried my ipod nano (luckily i was able to reboot my nano). i tried to charge my nano the second time and nothing happened.so bottom line, don't buy this product."
1,Warning --- stopped working very quickly,"I bought this and within a couple of months it just stopped working. very poor quality in my opinion, I guess you get what you pay for."
1,Doesn't work for my Samsung Captivate :(,"I bout this to charge my Captivate in the car, and when you plug it in it says that it is charging, but it does not charge at all."
1,Broke After 1 Day,"Literally, used it once. Next time I went to use it, it did not work. There are no imperfections around the outside, but obviously something is wrong on the inside because it does not work at all. 1 day. Absolutely ridiculous. Don't waste your time, money, or frustration on this item."
4,I like it!,The car cigeratte adapter gave me a great way to charge my iphone without having to remove out the case.
5,Works as advertised,I have been using this for a while now and I have no problem with it. It works great and it seems pretty durable.
2,Dead!,"I liked it but it's dead after few times using.I bought another one which has just one port in Korea when I visted to get a better quality.Now I don't have problem.I do not recommand to buy this thing even it's cheap, it is a waste of money!"
2,Worked for a month,This product worked for a month and then stopped it only worked in one of the ports and wouldn't work with my iPod cord
2,"Technically, it does the job... Poor construction, low amperage tho","While this product DOES charge my Droid Razr is does so at an amperage/charging rate at older phones not equipped for 1+amp chargers. It DOES, for the most part, work consistently but occasionally needs a tap to get seated correctly.All in all, it does what it's designed to do but due to poor construction quality and low amp rating does so less effectively than other, higher quality & amp chargers listed only a few $$ more."
3,Does what I need it to do,Charge my zune and my Phone . thought I was getting the smaller one but this one works no issues.
2,Cheap,"I got was I paid for. I works, but it feels and works ""cheaply.""My biggest complaint is that it sticks too far out of my socket, making it impossible to use directly. I had to buy an extender with a shallower plug. What a pain."
3,useful item as an iPhone charger in car,"Bought this one for my iPhone as charger in my car, works well, cheaper solution compared to radio shack or walmart. Sometimes I feel ridiculous to buy items from these stores as even the small item for regular use are too much expensive."
1,Piece of junk,"Mine turned out to be a piece of junk. No wonder the low price. I plugged it in to the cigarette lighter, but it was dead. Would not power anything up. I threw it away - it was not worth the trouble to return."
1,Dual USB Car Charger - Not so much,"I was soo excited to get and use my Dual USB Car Charger. I received it, plugged it in and the indicator light worked and all was well, until I went to plug it in for use on vacation and no indicator light. Tried it in a couple different ports in the car and nothing."
4,"A bit wide, but charges both mine and my passenger's phone","I bought this to use with an iPod and my phone, but now this has evolved mostly to charge an iPhone and an Android at the same time. It works great and charges both fine.Pros:-two chargers!-Red indicator light so you know if it has current or notCons:-A bit wide, so I have to keep mine in the center console charger (can't put it in the instrument stack part near the gear shifter because it's too wide for the cubby hole)Cheap, effective, can't complain."
1,Worked Great! FOR TWO DAYS. :(,"This seemed like a great, simple, inexpensive option for charging my iPod and Droid while driving, and it was...but only for two days. My iPod stopped registering that it was even plugged in to a charger, and my Droid started popping up with a message about having the wrong battery or something. Dumb. So, my advice is to not buy it. Spend a bit more money and get something that will last."
2,crap,"it stopped working after a week, and during that week it was hard to get to work, but i give it 2 stars cuz i was cheap and worked for the week i needed it too, but overall unhappy"
5,simple solution,"this usb car charger is a great in expensive product, it gets the job done at a good price ."
5,;],I LOVE THIS PRODUCT ;] IF YOU'LL BE ON A LONG DRIVE BOTH YOU AND A LOVED ONE CAN CHARGE YOUR PHONES WITHOUT FIGHTING FOR PORT
4,2-USB Cig-Light Charger,"Awesome the fact that it has 2-USB ports available for charging multiple devices. However, picture is misleading. Does not have a cig lighter adapter on end. Just 2-USB ports."
1,wished I would have known.,"I didn't realize that I couldn't charge both my iPhones. One port is for the iPhone and the other port is for an iPod normal, not an iTouch. So, unfortunately this isn't going to help my situation of charging at the same time. I wish the description had warned me."
1,Doesn't work with iPhone,"This item is not compatible with my iPhone 4s. Judging by the rest of the feedback on here, it doesn't appear to work with anyone elses either."
1,Not good,"It doesn't work! I was assuming it would work with my iPhone, and it doesn't. I'm not sure if mine is broken or just not compatible with the iPhone for some reason. I was really disappointed."
1,Does not work with iPhone,This product was advertised to charge iPhones.It does not charge any of the 3 iPhones (old or new) that my family has.
3,2 Port USB Charger,"You get what you pay for. It was pretty cheap and one of the ports quit working. I needed a charger for my phone and iPod, now I have to choose which one to charge"
4,Works Great,The car chartger came quickly and as soon as I received it I went out and tried it to make sure it was working. Everything seems to be working great. I haven't used it too much as yet but am hoping that it will hold up and last quite a while. Good adapter for the price. I recommend it.
1,Piece O' Crap!,I plugged it into my lighter receptacle and the tip fell off! DO NOT BUY... Cheap!!!! I guess you do get what you pay for!
1,Stopped working...,Great price but stopped working after less than one month of use. This is a waste of money. Use your money to buy a cup of coffee instead!
3,OK but...,They fail to tell you it will charge very slowly when you try to charge two devices at once with this item.
4,2 for price of one,Seems to work fine and allows 2 devices to be connected at the same time. Needs minimum space to store - leave in vehicle.
1,Junk,This did not work.It worked for a short time and just stopped working.You get what you pay for I guess.
4,does the job,needed this for an iphone and another gadget put didn't want to pay big store prices. thank goodness somebody out there made a reasonably priced generic one. i was real happy to have gotten this so cheap. no problems with it.
1,Waste,I used this charger once and it stopped working. It was a complete waste of money but I guess you get what you pay for.
1,Would not recommend.....,"The fuse inside the charger went off some way and made a blue flash, how my girlfriend explains it. I went to buy a new one from best buy don't waste your money!!"
3,okay,"okay just wish that my gps was able to pluginto it..but o well..works ahight i guess, like the fact it has 2 plug ins"
4,Works,"This works fine and I have had it for about a year now. It isn't the highest quality, but it has done the job and charges all of my phones."
2,Does charge properly,"Charges for only 20 minutes then over heats and stops completely. The problem is that is use a weak power chip. You can try to replace it, but then you made need the PCB design from the manufacturer."
4,good product,easy to install and remove when you are done charging your phone. Has an indicator light to let you know that it is installed correctly
3,charger,"works as expected - what is there to say, I needed a charger and this is a charger - these postings are dumb"
2,Sometimes you get what you pay for,Purchased this so that both myself and the BF could charge our phones at the same time while on a trip. It worked great for about 6 months and the contacts have gotten *very* finnicky. Now have to wiggle it around to get it to charge properly. Was cheap enough that it's not too big a complaint though. This product is great to hold you over until you can buy a better one.
1,Terrible,"This worked great the first 2 times and then it either died or started to whistle when plugged in. Charge wasn't that great either, bad product."
4,Great connector,Great quality plug that has worked with no issues. The dual plug makes it so much easier to commute and charge without having to disconnect one device to charge the other.
1,piece of poop,this lasted only about a week. I guess you get what you pay for on small stuff like this lol
2,Does not work.,I have a 2003 Kia Spectra and it does not work and also the USB ports don't fit well. Definitely returning.
3,"Works, but not well shielded","This plug works as advertised, but throws off a LOT of RF noise. If you've got the radio on when you plug in something to charge, you will suddenly get a lot of static ... especially on weaker stations. This is only a problem if you regularly listen to the radio while something's plugged into the USB charger."
2,Warning: Not compatible with iPhone 4 or 4S,"We've tried an iPhone 3GS, 4, and now 4S with this adapter. We're using the official Apple USB charging cord.The 3GS will charge, but the 4 and 4S will not, complaining that the ""accessory is not compatible"". We've tried this in several cars and with several USB cords."
3,Great price if charging smaller electronics,It does not give enough juice to charge my EVO which is what I bought it for. It would be terrific for smaller electronics though.
4,don't know what to say,"sorry, I wrote the wrong review for this item... for this one, I haven't use this one! once I USE IT , I will edit my reviews"
2,Didn't work with Blackberry's!!,This item isn't powerful enough to charge a blackberry. Always had a display message basically stating that it was under powered.
3,Barely works,"I bought this because of the price. It was too cheap to pass up. However, it doesn't charge consistently. I plugged my 80g zune into it and it barely gives it enough juice to stay alive. It maintains a charge at best. If it's at 5%, it stay at 5%. It took 30 minutes for it to go from dead to the lowest charge setting possible.It does work for my moto Droid, though. These are the only two things I have tried using with it so far. Like I said, I gave it a 3-star because of the price of the product, and the fact that it does charge my phone. It's a let down that it doesn't do what it says completely."
1,You get what you pay,"Shipped pretty quickly. Plugged it into my car and it worked for 2 hours before one port quit working and it only took a day for the other to give out. Cheap enough for an experiment, but save yourself the hassle and pay the extra money for a quality one."
3,Fringe Average,"It works, but it is very slow to charge. I use this to charge a phone or two at a time, but when I charge two phones it is really slow."
3,Works OK Great for the Price,"VERY GOOD PRICEWe had plugged an Iphone and Blackberry plugged into it and it would only charge one.Other than that it works great, I have one in my truck and one in the wifes car!I would still recommend this item !"
2,BE CARFULL!,"This is a good product for the money! But beware, it is rated at 5 amps, most usb including your computer is rated at 1A. So do not charge your phone unless it is an emergency, cause over time it will kill your battery."
1,Didn't work,My charger didn't work at all. Tried it in 2 different cars so I know it wasn't my lighter outlet that was the problem. Received a refund from Amazon.
1,Product OK Shipping a RIPOFF!,"Product checked to be OK when I testing it. I just seems wrong that a 2.75 item costs 2.98 to ship, when you by two it should have been the same cost but it was another 2.98 to the cost. What a RIP OFF!"
3,Cigarette Lighter Adapter,"I figured my mp3 player would charge and work at the same time, but I found out that when it's plugged in, the mp3 player will ONLY charge and not play at the same time. So if the car is not on, it won't charge. Therefore you can't listen to it when the car is running because that is when it charges. You have to bring it in the house and charge it. Not very useful if you can't have it plugged in charging as it plays."
4,I'm Happy,"Seller really works with customer. I will buy again, product works great no problems. cig. insert fits tight and the two usb ports are clean and snug. red led works when i plug it in. what more could you ask for."
1,This is junk.,"Skip this one and spend a couple of bucks more on a quality product. I bought two of these and neither one worked! Giving the benefit of the doubt, I tested them in four different vehicles and got the same result...failure. This is junk."
3,Worked Perfectly - Then Died,"This thing worked perfectly and I was really pumped about the cheap price. But, recently, it completely died and no longer works at all (about 4 months after purchase). Could have been shorted out when I recently changed my battery, but everything else is still working fine, so I don't think that's the case."
4,Car charger,The item was received much quicker than quoted and works great. I wish I had ordered two of them since my wife has confiscated this one for herself. Item was delivered 2 weeks after it was ordered compared to Amazon estimate of 4 to 6 weeks. I also ordered sync cables and wall charger but those are from ValleyBuy and I have yet to receive those. So next time I order something I will make sure it is from Nice Eshop.
1,Died after a month,"Product no longer works after 1 month of sporadic use. I purchased a single port one from [...] which has been working for well over a year with no problems, only cost a couple bucks."
1,Blew the fuse twice...,This product blew the 20A fuse in my car twice when attempting to charge my LG Optimus G Android... What is it for if not to charge an iPod/Smartphone?? Should include more technical details in the description...
2,Not the right one delivered and does not work anyway,"After reviewing the item I ordered, I realized that I was not even sent the correct item. This also is incapable of providing enough power to charge or sustain the charge on my HTC G1. It might work for other devices but I can not confirm that."
4,Ok,"I just got this, I haven't used it yet but it sure looks like it is durable but fragile if you thing of dropping it from your hand... It is just plastic and a good connection of energy"
1,DOA,"Dead on arrival. Also, construction feels extremely cheap- flimsiest plastic you can find and you can crush it in your hand. You get what you pay for."
4,"Ugly, but works fine","I was concerned about purchasing this product, mainly because I wasn't sure it would work for the price. I was pleasantly surprised. It charges both my Blackberry and my iPhone 3G. What else could I want?"
4,Good Purchase,"I was looking for a car charger for my 16gig 3g iphone that charged my phone & my apple bluetooth ear bud. As I looked I found that many people were having problems finding such a thing. I read bad reviews about other chargers killing iphones and I was a little hesitent, But I purchased this one and took a chance. It works great in my vw beetle. Good Luck with yours."
2,I'm having some trouble with one port only works sometime,Trouble I'm having some trouble with one port only works sometimeTrouble I'm having some trouble with one port only works sometime
5,great,"This unit was more than i expected,i use it for my phone and other things that can use this port at the same time. great Leonard"
2,2 port iPhone car charger,I did not see in the ad where this was for a 3 or 3gs phone. I have iPhone 4's and they will not charge on this. I wish I had not of bought them.
5,Fast Service,"I ordered a dual USB car charger and received the purchesed product within 5 business days (no shipping charges). These puppies retail for approx 5 - 25 bucks in the local stores (Five Below, WalMart, Best Buy) - I got this one for less than $3! So far so good - it charges my smart phone while I cruise down the road."
1,Does not work,"This charger does not work for my iPhone 4S or my Husbands 3G. I was a nice thought not having to take turns charging out phones in the car, espically on long trips. I have one of these that plugs into the wall in my house and we love it. But this one was a huge disappointment!I would have returned it if my kids had not thrown away all of the packaging."
2,Don't Try to use both plug ins,I needed to plug in two things at the same time but this item will not let this happen. Look at a different item if that is what you want.
1,Trash,don't bother with this. it quit working in 2 months. I have no good things to say about this product.
3,Slow Ship,"Took 3 weeks to receive from the time ordered. Otherwise product is what I was looking for, and works great in the car."
1,Worst,I bought it cause it was very cheap and after reading the review i thought i would be having 50% chance of this product working properly....... sadly i happen to be in company of non working side.....I tried for 30mins to figure out which port would work and even switched cars. The products shows (red light is glowing)it gets input from car but it is not charging the iphone and itouch.
1,NOT Happy!!,"I did NOT work! Was not worth the trouble to return it, cheap made. I would not recommend ANybody buying this, I went on a car trip, thought I had a reliable charger, And guess what!! It did not work."
5,As good as the original!,This works great! You would never know it's not an original Apple product. Arrived within 10 days. No problems with this car charger at all.
2,Not For IPad2,"I purchased this for my iPad2 but it woudn't charge it. It works for my son's iPod, which is good I guess. Now I can't charge my iPad2 on the go."
1,Does what it's supposed to do.,"What can I say? Quick, easy, and works - what more can you ask?Update to the first review: this thing lasted about a month, then the cheap plastic guide piece inside one of the USB sockets broke, making that port unusable. Okay, I only used one of them most of the time. About a week later, it quit working altogether. I found that the contacts in the broken socket had touched, and apparently fried the voltage regulator chip. Spend your money on a better quality unit."
2,Better options out there,"Based on what I physically received, I expected more for what I paid.The reasons are:1) It feels cheap, the seams flex easily and product weight is so light that I question its durability2) Was expecting a shiny/glossy finish, but it's a matte finish that I expect to be difficult to keep clean. Parlay the fact that it's white I expect to replace this soon"
1,OK but found a much smaller one,"I purchased this but then found a much smaller one (in black) at a national retailer (not T) that fits just about completely inside of my car AC outlet, so less than half the size of this--which is great because then I can leave the adaptor in and close the cover completely.Amazing that they could make a 2-port so small. I'm going to grab another one the next time I'm shopping there.UPDATE: Found the better/smaller product I mentioned above on Amazon. Search for: PowerJolt Dual Micro"
4,usb charger,received on time. this is accepatble. i do not have the time to write long extended reviews. this is ridiculous waste of my time.
3,power,tried to charge my htc thunderbolt for 2 hours with this thing and phone didn't budge. i need 1 amp per port. that means i need a charger of 2 amps total if i want the 2 ports.
1,Didn't work with any of my devices,"Received this product in a timely manner but it was non functional. Didn't work with my iphone 3G, Samsung Captivate, or Nintendo DS. Perhaps I just received a defective one and maybe it works for another buyer."
5,Works with my IPhone 3G,"I have had no issues charging my iPhone 3G in the car. Never tried to charge two units at the same time, but one works fine"
1,Total crap,Never worked out of the box. I went to Radio Shack and paid $19 for a similar item which works flawlessly. Avoid this item.
5,Great for price,"Great for the price. Works well.It would be nice if they had it marked somehow which port is which. Both of them won't charge my iPod - just one will. Still, well worth the $."
5,Great!,I ordered this product and received it in a couple of weeks. It was just as it appeared in the picture. I will definitely order again.
3,You get what you pay for...,"Worked well for about 1 year. Stopped working completely, so now I have to buy another one. But it's so cheap that you can't really fault the product, you get what you pay for."
1,Absolutly killed battery!,"Do not waste your little bit of money on this peice of crap. It worked the first day I used it, and then after that it didn't do anything. A coupled days later it would absolutly drain my battery! My battery was completly fried after that, because I would charge it (at home) and an hour later my phone would be dead! The only reason I didn't send it back is because it was really cheap! I'm so mad!"
1,did not work,I received this item in ample time but unfortunately it does not work. I tried it multiple times with various cars and none of them worked. I tried both USB ports and different cables but the products still is defective.
1,Cheap quality product,"This is good product and price is very good. Both port works perfect. I have been using this USB car charger since 5 months, so far no issue, i hope it will work long.UPDATE:=============After 5 months of use, it has stop working. It is not at all reliable, if you are lucky enough it will work 4-5 months otherwise, sometime middle of your trip you will end up losing charging.Made mistake to buy cheap product, which is not at all reliable.I'll spend couple of bugs more and buy good quality."
1,lighter usb adapter,"unfortunately this product did not last no even a moth, very disappointed. i will not recommended to anyone because it did not last."
4,good for the price,"this is a very cheap product, which i really liked! and the most important part.. it works very well. i've seen some bad reviews on it, but i use it in my car all the time! works perfectly fine. i have an HTC thunderbolt. i definitely suggest this item! well worth the price."
3,Eh,Kind of fussy. The USB cord has to be in a certain position in order for it to make a good connection and actually charge my phone. Either way it still works if I keep an eye on it.
4,"Works, wish it were smaller",We've had one each of these in our two vehicles for four months now and both function just fine. I only wish they were a little more compact and streamlined. Otherwise I have no complaints.
2,1 port is not working for this,2 Port USB Car Cigarette Lighter Adapter - Only one port is working .. Can you please help me here. Can you send another one for which 2 ports are working & Guide me how to return this ?
4,It's fine.,"The quality is a bit cheap, but for the price, hey, it does the job. Fits snuggly into the car plug. No real complaints."
1,Bad Bad Bad,One side doesn't work. Item overheated when I plugged it in and I thought it was going to catch fire. I am lucky that it didn't damage my cell phone. You get what you pay for and this item can potentially damage your expensive electronics.
1,Product Does Not Work As Advertised,"The product I received was the product pictured; however, only one of the outlets works on the 2-port charger. The whole point of ordering it was to have two outlets available so it was a pointless purchase. I may have received a defective unit. I have not contacted the seller about the issue."
3,Update to Earlier Review,"I give this product a so-so review when I first got it because the quality seemed very poor. After about 2 months of occasional use, one of the ports stopped working. Supplier had sent me an email a few days before this asking what they could do to improve my review of their product. I sent back a note to send me one that would work for more than a few weeks. I didn't expect anything from them, but in a few days I received an new adapter that seems to be better quality than the first one. At least they do stand behind their products."
3,good,"good, hope it could last for a while as my first one which was another brand died a few days later"
3,"0.5 amp charging power, may not supply enough to charge some phones","Nifty little item, maximum of only 0.5 amp charging power. May not be enough for some phones or players.Did not charge my Motorola Q phone or change the battery icon to charging icon."
1,Bought 2 of these adapters and they both quit,"I bought this adapter because it was the cheapest one available on Amazon. It worked great for 2 months then just quit working. I looked for a fuse or reset on the adapter but I couldn't locate any. So I went back online and bought the same adapter again. This time it only sadly worked for about 1 month or so. This time I spent a few extra bucks on a ""Scosche"" adapter. You can immediately differentiate the quality, craftsmanship, and materials between the two. I've had the ""Scosche"" USB adapter for almost 5 months. So I say in this case YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR."
1,Horrible,I ordered this charger hoping to finally be able to charge my phone in the car. Unfortunately this piece of junk worked for one hour and broke after that. It is not worth the money... even though it is so cheap!
1,China made China paid.,It's so made in China buy not disappointment guarenteed cheap American cow. Trust me save up get something better that won't die in a week and short the fuses in your car thus making cheap not so cheap. Stupid Cheap Me.
1,Not a durable one,"This is a waste of money. The charger stops working after 2 months. Purchased and used it during the spring break, then left it unused for 2 months and it's dead. Buyers beware."
1,Does Not Work,"I bought this car charger for my iphone and it doesn't work. At all. The light turns on, but it doesn't charge anything, tried it with an android and a different usb cable as well."
3,Working / Not working list,"Here are my results for what will charge:Works for:Kindle 3G 6""HTC Inspire 4GDoes NOT charge:Nokia N8ipad 1G"
2,Can only use one side,"I bought this to charge my blackberry torch and itouch. However, the power for one of the outlets is not enough to charge either item. When I plug it in a message pops up, ""not sufficant power source"" So I'm glad I can still use the one side, but not what I was hoping for."
1,cheap and doesn't stay connected,"If there's even a little shake on the unit, it disconnects and you have to push it back in. Spend couple dollars more to get a better one."
1,SERIOUS ENGINEERING FLAW,"I bought two of these ""2 Port USB Car Cigarette Lighter Adapter Dual Plug for iPod MP3 Players Charger - Color White"" Both adapter tip's literally fell apart."
3,Great value for the price,"It tends to overheat after using for a while, but for the price it is exactly what you'd expect if not better."
2,An OK experience,"I did receive the product in a timely manner. It was in good conditions just like it was described on the website but I had some issues with it later on. But for the price I purchased it, it wasn't worth pursuing a return. I would recomand this seller but maybe not the product."
4,Nice,"Works great with my android, the iPhone 3g is a little frigidity. Charges fine on the lock screen, but trying to use while charging it encounters a issue, where it connects and disconnects. But for the price, I'll charge the iPhone on the lock screen.No issues while charge android and iPhone simultaneously. Recommended for the price."
3,Eh,"Since these are so cheap I can't blame the product quality, but mine broke within a month or two. I ended up just buying one of the higher end ones. So 3$ for a month or two, but if you need something that will last and can take more of a beating then just go for something better made (yeah that means more expensive).I took mine apart and found that the problem was a faulty connection between a spring and the circuit board, tried soldering it once and got it working. Shortly after it broke again though. In the end decided it wasn't worth the time."
1,"Terrible, doesn't work with ipod touch even though coloring would imply that it can be.","This product was very cheap, and I'm sure it works for other products, but for any i product, it seems to (as indicated by my usage, and the usage of others). Do not purchase if you intend to use it with an ipod, or iphone, because it appears not to work."
1,DO NOT BUY,"These adapters do NOT work. Don't waste your time or money ordering them. I bought two chargers in my order and tried both of them in multiple cars, the phones indicate they are charging but the battery life remaining in the phone never increases. Waste of money"
1,A Waste of Money,"This product is completely useless because it does not what do what it's said to do. I bought it to charge myiphone 4 in my car, but when I plugged it in, my iphone read ""not supported with this accessory"" EVEN THOUGH IT READs ON AMAZONthat it is COMPATIBLE WITH APPLE IPHONE. It is a complete waste of money, even if its only $3.45."
1,Worse than Useless,"I ordered this book as part of my continuing professional education requirement to retain my CPA certification.Pros: The author does include some useful (if basic) information about the styles of equity investments (what exactly is a ""Value"" stock, anyway?), some decent trading rules, and does make some very prescient comments about the fact that ""investment analysis"" provided by Wall Street is often either self serving or wrong....Con: Warwick does a disservice to the investing public by suggesting that they can beat the pros by 7-13% by using (his) stock screening software. Do your own due diligence: either pick an industry (perhaps the one you work in) and get to know it intimately, or bet on the broader markets with sector funds and an investment advisor you know and trust, or both. This book is in the same category as the ""Rich Dad, Poor Dad"" series of books: Investment porn that feeds the fantasy that you can do it better than everyone else."
3,Regular,"el cd no es lo que esperaba pero tampoco es basura, todos esperabamos algo mas fuerte y con mas tiradera de parte de voltio por todas sus colaboraciones anteriores. pero aparte de eso el disco vale la pena, es bastante variado y se siente que las composiciones son de cora.entre mis canciones favoritas estan ""maliantes de carton"", ""julio maraña"", la colaboracion con zion y lennox, las colaboraciones con tego, ""bumper""."
3,Vale la pena comprar...,"Voy a escribir algo breve... el cd vale la pena pero no es algo de otro mundo. Algunas canciones son buenas para bailar y otras no. Muchas son canciones tirando indirectas, no son muchas las q se pueden bailar, pero las q hay se pueden bailar con gusto. El feat de Voltio con Zion y Lennox quedo excelente. Al igual que ultima cancion ""Achero pa' un palo"" q es una cancion de Salsa con el grupo ""Sonora Ponceña"" que quedo buenisimo. En conclucion, el cd no es la gran cosa pero tampoco es malo."
2,Turgid and slow,"Researching the history of race relations between Korean Americans and other groups, I purchased this book because of its subject matter. Although it describes some key events in the LA riots of the early '90's, the writing leaves a great deal to be desired and the authors' thesis is not well-argued."
3,bus,thought the bus would have been a little bigger scale but for the best part it is a good product.
3,Smooth... too smooth?,"Been a fan of TW since You've Got the Power, early '80s, so I hate to give a mediocre review. If you like your reggae smooth, with polished harmony, you'll dig this CD... Title song is a boom tune, last cut is good, Washington and Saw add some vitality, but for me, this CD doesn't deliver roots reggae in the good ol' TW tradition. Tracks another viewer rated as favs, Paradise, Shine On Me, with their super-smooth ""Boyz II Men"" harmony, along with some other cuts that are borderline, to me come close to seriously tarnishing TW's legacy as a roots band. Which is too bad, because they're a world music treasure. Love you guys, but give us roots!Listened to the samples of their recent Black Gold & Green cd and it sounds much better. If you're roots, go with that one ahead of this."
3,"This was a VERY sexy story, graphic at times!","The beautiful Alaskan winter-wilderness setting and the colorful secondary characters added degrees of depth, as did the adventuresome storyline of uncovering Uncle Kurt and his accomplice Vivian's motives and plot to swindle Ally out of her inheritance. I enjoyed this story, although not as much as the original Nerd book, perhaps because Mitch wasn't a true Nerd, but rather a hunky undercover PI/bodyguard using a Nerd disguise."
1,Not to my liking....,"The books story line is great, girl inherits mega bucks and doesn't care; she wants to make it on her own abilities, she meets stud muffin in nerds clothing and sparks fly while he saves her from her evil uncle and his S&M; girlfriend. The problem with the book is that it is shallow and fails to achieve the much sought after sexual tension between the two main characters. Almost continuous reference to sex barely covers the fact that there is very little story being told. Dialog between characters is forced and unnatural.I did not care for the style of the authors writing and suggest that if you are going to read this book that you check it out from a library or buy it at a re-use shop so you do not waste your money as I did."
3,Not Bad in my opinion,I thought the book was pretty good. I've never read anything by this author and was in the mood for a book and just grabbed it. Not having done my research for this one I was impressed. I think the story line was good and the main characters were believable. The supporting characters and the location were not too realistic with the talk of sex being such a hot and common topic. But I did like the book. I laughed out loud several times and the tension between the two characters was pretty good.
3,Depleted Nerd?,"I absolutely LOVED the first two 'Nerd' books, so there wasn't any doubt that I wouldn't buy this one! The characters ALWAYS have great chemistry between each other and alot of wit. But, it seems as though the series may be dwindling down. It is getting really monotonous. Once I read a few pages, I guessed the story-line was the same as the others... nerd likes girl, girl dislikes nerd. Something happens to girl, nerd saves day and they live happily ever after.I can only hope that a different outline begins to form for this series or I will be getting these books from the library or not read them at all."
3,It'll work,This book works for a beginner. Although I like the lessons I wish that it had more everyday phrases because I'm not sure how to put the words altogether yet to make sentences.
1,"Item sent was oem, not Eureka 61830A","This item is represented as being factory original with the picture, but I was sent a product made by EnviroCare Technologies. It did fit, though it took some hard pushing as it was a slightly different size."
1,Did no fit right!,"I ordered 2 of these for my vacuum that takes a HF-5 filter. It was not built right, so I didn't fit my Eureka Boss 4D Pet Fresh vacuum. The clips were not bent right, so It wouldn't snap on. First they only sdent me one, but I contacted them and they sent the second one right away!! So when it didn't fit, I emailed them, (wouldn't give me a number to call them) they gave me directions on how to send them back. Paid 21 something for them and had to pay to ship back ($8) and then they charged me a restocking fee ($4). Not very happy, emailed them again, and all they would say is restocking fee was charged. WILL NOT BUY FROM AGAIN!!!!"
2,It works...... but,"This was so hard to install! I was worried I would break my vacuum by lying it on it's side and using my body weight to pop the filter into place but it just wasn't quite the perfect fit, even though it is the correct model # to fit my Eureka ""The Boss"" big and yellow vacuum. It works well though."
1,Terrible,"I recently had the misfortune of using this text for a Computer Architecture class. I read and re-read every chapter several times to always have to search out more material just to be able to answer the end of chapter questions. The book may be good as a second text, but should never be used as the main or only text for a class. There are supposedly no prerequisite readings for this, yet I highly disagree!"
1,This book is a failure,"I was forced to buy this book for my Architecture class. I really regret wasting my money on it. In short, the book [stinks]. It assumes too many things. It does not do a very good job explaining some important pieces of information. For the most part, the student will spend the whole time trying to make sense out of what the author is saying. It is one of these ""should've..could've"" books!If you are looking for an architecture book, I wouldn't recommend this one."
1,Plan to spend a lot of time looking at other references.,"a = b, c, and d.e = f, g, and h.b > e while a < f.ac < gh while fh < bd.c can be diagrammed in this box if you use h.g is shown in this truth table if you use a.Part of what makes this text so difficult to understand is the author's inability to use consistent terms while trying to explain material. In the first chapter, a simple And gate is referred to as 'AND', 'x^y', 'x.y', 'xy', '()()', and 'and'. All true, but used interchangeably while trying to explain makes the concepts incredibly difficult to decipher, particularly when variations for representing other boolean concepts are added to the fray.The best part of the book, as far as I can tell, is that the key terms are in bold so I know what to plug into Google to try and figure out what it is."
1,A failure for purely academic reasons,"The first chapter is the most important in the book. And yet it is riddled with poor grammar, truth table errors, no answers to questions in the back of book etc. I don't understand how someone who understands the subject can convey so little meaningful information. Actually I do understand, and this book's academic blasphemy should be burnt black as ruined toast. Money down the drain, as Ricky Ricardo ""splained"" things to Lucy at a much higher level. This book leaves me bitter if you hadn't noticed."
1,Consistently inconsistent,"Most of the other 1-star reviews have covered the outstanding deficiencies of this text. I am 3/4 of the way through this book. It is the second course I have taken that used this text. It is thoroughly inconsistent. Concepts are not explained in a thorough and meaningful way, sometimes not at all. Logical progression (ability to connect concepts) is very poor.It is at times impossible to solve the problems at the end of the chapter because they lack enough detail to understand what is actually required.I am not a lazy student who is mad about my bad grade. I got an A in my previous course and am on track to get another; however, it has required A LOT more work than any other courses - mainly because of the terrible text.Please avoid this text if you possibly can!!!"
1,"Weak learning tool, likely good reference book.","This is the least pdagogic technical text I have read to date. The material lacks coherence between points. It almost feels like a PowerPoint slide show that is missing the speaker to tie the points together.That is compounded by poor illustrations that are also full of errata. The high purchase price is unjustified bt the poor production value.(e.g. Karnaugh maps could have been much clearer if colors were used)It may turn out to be a suitable reference work for some one who already knows the topic, but surely not to learn from."
1,Keep Lookin,"This book was required for my Computer Systems & Architecture class. The other reviewers did a good job of highlighting how bad this book is. The only thing I will add is, if this book is required for a course you don't really much choice other than to buy it (so good luck). If you're buying this book for the sake of learning about computer architecture I would not recommend this one."
1,"Not ""Universal"" At All","I guess they're shipping a new version of the product than what's listed. The one I just received has XBOX 360, Playstation 2/3, and Nintento Wii connections on it. There is NO connection for Gamecube and NO connection for the original XBOX. Don't waste your money."
1,Description innacurate,"Description say work for XBOX and XBOX360 but only works for XBOX360, PS2, PS3 And Wii"
1,Doesn't work with all TVs,"I picked up one of these cables from a local Gamestop hoping to cut down on clutter with my setup. Unfortunately, these cables simply didn't work with my TV. While I could get a signal if I reduced everything to 480i, I could only get garbage from setting higher than that (and yes, I did flip the switch to ""HD"") which really defeats the purpose of getting component cables. When I saw other people posting the same issues online with other TVs, I returned the cables for a full refund. Be cautious when buying these cables, they may not work with your setup."
4,Muy bueno,excelente producto lo recomiendo funciona bien con el xbox 360 el playstation 3 y el wii es muy buen producto
1,Nintendo players beware,"Although you will see this listed as ""Gamecube Compatible"" for this product. it is not. Only MS and Sony need apply for this one. look at the model number. if it is the same as this one, it won't work on your gamecube. spent $40 and three weeks before realizing this.way to go amazon for keeping the description accurate!"
2,Works but quality bad,"This product worked perfectly for my PS3 and Wii. Unfortunately you cannot have both plugged in at the same time so you still have to do some swapping.The reason I am rating this low is because the quality is bad. A little pin or something broke off inside the ps3 wire and i can no longer plug it into my ps3. The metal plug that goes into the ps3 is now loose and gets pushed down inside the plastic outer casing.Could be a flaw in just mine, but the having to swap could have easily caused this issue.In conclusion, works fine, until it breaks."
1,DOA,"The cable is obviously poorly designed as It was defective out of the box.The video was distorted and I kept getting scanbars all over my screen, I went to another brand of cable with no issue!"
4,convenient and cheap,"Impressive!!! Just one cable and it's component, to hook up three systems. I noticed just a minimal picture improvement. But, at this price, I highly recommend it."
1,"As the other reviewer notes, this isn't Gamecube Compatible","But Amazon seems to have repaired the listing, now if only the jerk seller would honor a refund . . ."
2,Needs improvment,The problem I have with this product is the length of the cable where it connects to the consoles. That part is so short the only way you can connect all three consoles is to stack them on top of each other or leave all of them standing on their sides. The pig tail needs to be longer at the splitter and it would be much better. I also had no sound from my PS3 so I ended up returning it anyway.
1,Xbox Players beware,"This component cable is not compatible with the original Xbox. It's only compatible with Xbox 360, Wii and PS2Way to Go Amazon for inaccurate description"
2,Misleading Product Information,"This product works fine, if you don't want to keep 2-3 devices hooked up at once. First of all, the split end of the cable is quite short (~2 inches), not leaving much room for attaching to multiple outputs, requiring one device to practically be stacked on top of the other. Also, we weren't able to have two devices hooked at once and switch between them. The picture came through, but no audio, and we had to unplug one device to get audio for the other. For us, this defeats the purpose of having one cable to hook multiple devices to the same input on a single TV."
2,No sound w/Wii and Xbox 360 plugged in,We are unable to get Sound on the Wii while the Xbox is plugged in (but powered off). To resolve this we need to unplug the Xbox. When they work the cables are fine but the fact that they don't 'automatically' work when we switch between consols prevents this from being a solution we can really be happy with.Will update if I can get the sound working.
5,Works as advertised,Works fine for me. A little bulky but that is because it supports so many different consoles.
3,"Works for Wii and XBox, PS2 Fail",The cord works nicely with connecting the Wii and the XBox but all three together. I already had the chord I needed for the PS2 plus I don't like the limited space to work all three so it turned out alright but if you need all three connected then don't use this product.
4,Well..............,"im kinda on the fence about this 1, it was only about $10 so not like i got screwed big time. ok, so let me just start from the beginning, i have a 22' Enhanced definition TV for my bedroom. so its not one of the bix box ones but its not HD. so no HDMI. i have a ps3 and a wii..i was using the regular red white yellow cables for them. it was kinda difficult to see what was goin on in GTA and black ops for ps3, becuz everything just blended in and was sort of fuzzy. so i originally bought this for picture quality. and it works for that. so im glad i bought this. BUT it doesnt work with the wii, i plugged them both in and right as i turned my ps3 off i wanted to see if it worked for the wii, so i turn the wii on and nothing. so i use the regular cords for the wii. its really not that big of deal and like i said im glad i bought i bought it because theres a noticably better picture.. but i just wish it worked for both."
2,Padded show becomes tedious,"As the Amazon Editorial review notes, this is basically a stand up routine padded out with excrutiatingly tedious filler. I thought that maybe 30% of her act was funny, and the rest fell flat. If you like Sarah, rent it before you buy it -- I can't imagine why anyone would want to watch this a 2nd time. If you want crude humor, get The Aristocrats, or any season of South Park. IMO, Sarah has a long way to go before she can sustain a one-woman show."
2,DON'T BUY THIS!!!,"This DVD absolutely sucks! It's the most overrated thing I've ever seen other than Talladega Nights. If you want ""shocking,"" ""edgy,"" or ""offensive"" humor, then you can do much better than this! Silverman's comedy crawls along, and the jokes are so few and far between- it's like listening to your fourteen-year-old sister who thinks she is SOOOOO, like, funny (twirl of the hair). I laughed about once every ten minutes. If you want truly innovative and offensive humor, try Wonder Showzen, Jackass Number Two, or save your money for Borat!"
1,Jesus is Magic - Sarah is NOT,"Incredibly unfunny DVD. And before you jump in say ""she's edgy and you just don't get it"" save your breath. Sarah has no edge, or sense of humor. If you pay attention, the audience isn't even laughing very much. A complete waste of money and time."
1,Dull and Boring,"I had really looked forward to seeing this after hearing Sarah interviewed several times. I know her humor can offend people, but that's usually because they don't catch the ""tongue-in-cheekness"" of it. This, well... I was disappointed. There were a few clever jokes, but by and large it was pretty dull. I have to admit that I didn't stick it out and just turned it off after 20 minutes. I was expecting something hilarious and instead I got a marginally decent stand-up routine and two incredibly dumb skits.I wouldn't sell your Sarah Silverman stock yet, but I would DEFINTELY recommend you rent this if you've got a burning desire to see it. Even then, it may not be worth the price of admission :("
1,She's a better singer than comedian,"I loved Borat, the Jackass movies, the Clerks movies...all offensive humor but very very funny. So I thought I would like this. I hated it! The so called jokes just didn't work. I don't think it's even the jokes themselves, but her timing, delivery, and especially her attitude of look at me, I'm so funny and bad! She's not original, just a complete gimmick with PR as slick as her black hair. How much did audience members get paid to laugh? Or maybe it's just a laugh track because the camera hardly shows the audience. It was a waste of my money and minutes of my life that I will never get back. Comedy isn't supposed to put you in a bad mood. How could I not have noticed that 87 people are trying to get rid of copies? I won't bother trying to resell it. I'm just going to throw it in the trash and watch Borat for some comic relief."
2,"Jesus is Magic, Sarah is Contrived","I like the concept of the DVD and the execution, but Sarah herself as a comedian is contrived and trite. She seems to be specifically seeking ""controversial"" topics and poking fun at them. It gets a bit tedious after a time. She thinks she is being fun and on the fringe, but she is pretty lame in the end. I ended up fast forwarding a lot of this DVD. Not worth buying for sure and hardly worth a rental. She seems 10 years too late. I hope her next movie/DVD is a bit more original and not so trying to push the envelope - it shows she is trying too hard (and that is sad)."
2,"Hey, watch me. I'm over here. Look, look.","Well, I guess we need humor to soften or make sense of life's hard parts. But shock-value comics can easily slip into vulgarity, and who wants to catch themselves laughing at vulgarity? My common reactions to this DVD were ""did she really say that?!?"", not ""gee, that was funny"". I do like her amusement at life's incongruities and wish she could do more of that and less orifice humor.Silverman seems to have little sense of comic timing; she just seems to stumble across punch lines or almost forgets to recite them. Her continual playing with her hair was an annoyance and borderline unprofessional. The pretaped segments and music videos were lame and obvious padding/filler.Root-canal comics often back themselves into a one-dimensional outhouse of their own building. Use of the f-word automatically tends to crowd out the subtle gradations between reality and what-should-be from which most humor springs."
2,Sarah Silverman is not hot enough to carry this garbage for 72 minutes...,"If you have never seen extremely vulgar comedy, this DVD might be very amusing to you. However, if your a fan of George Carlin, Richard Pryor, Chris Rock, etc.....this is not worth your time.Most of the jokes are not witty or insightful in the slightest little bit and rely soley on their obscene nature for humour. Again, virgin ears might find it amusing--those looking for good comedy will sit in silence with the occasional chuckle and eventually just get bored and turn it off.I'm half-way convinced Sarah Silverman actually wrote this in one day (as the opeing sequence alludes to) and that the whole thing was one big joke on everyone who paid money to watch it. Thankfully I did not and you should not either."
2,Not really funny at all,"I'm a big fan of Mr. Show and thus i decided to rent this film this past week when i saw it at the video store and i have to say i was very disappointed in it. Her humor is, for one, not that funny and rarely witty. Second of all, it seems like she falls back on 'controversial' humor such as ethic jokes like a crutch, as if for no other reason than to show that she is 'edgy'. This more often seems to come out a bit forced, and given how many times she references it just gets old more than anything else. Like, it would be one thing if they were actually funny ethic jokes, but they are for the most part pretty lame, and thus they seem pointless. There is little to no plot, it consists of mainly short musical vignettes in addition to her stand up which takes up the majority of the film.seriously, don't rent this or buy this...if you do and find out that it sucks as much as i'm saying, dont say i didn't warn you"
1,"If you like her show, this IS NOT! for you..","okay, first let me say i love the Sarah Silverman Program. I think she is amazingly hilarious and incredibly original.NOW. having gotten that out of the way I must say that I was so incredibly disappointed with Jesus Is Magic i don't even have words to describe how i feel. The show was peppered with funny parts, i will admit.. funny lines as well. The problem is those funny parts and funny lines are so very few and far between that it makes it a complete and entire waste of time. The parts that were the funniest were the songs that Ms. Silverman sings. Those same songs, by the way, I had seen on YouTube the day prior to buying the DVD. In seeing the clips, i assumed the rest of the show would have been as funny as the clips.. I was so wrong.MY ADVISE: Search for Sarah Silverman on YouTube, enjoy the clips and take your $19.99 and buy yourself something you might actually enjoy. and if u MUST own it, I happen to have one I would love to sell you. CHEAP."
2,2 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:The plot is merely a cheap construct around Sarah Silverman's comedy routines, and her routines showcase an inability to build comic momentum; beyond a few laughs there's little reason to spend time or money on ""Jesus is Magic."""
2,Shock Value and Vulgarity Are Not Humor or Wit,"I just didn't get her at all. Here's this Jewess with an obvious nose job (something apparently endemic in the culture) and frizzy hair saying anything for shock value. She's crass, bigoted, unfunny and uninspired. OK, she's willing to cross any line. Big deal. So was I...in sixth grade. As an adult, however, I much more value insightful comedy with an intelligent wit. She's the antithesis of that. Yet one has to believe that someone this over the top and self-involved should be on the stage or screen somewhere. Maybe doing dog food commercials...."
1,not true widescreen; cropped picture,The aspect ratio is messed up on the dvd (or how it displays on my dvd player). It says widescreen on the box but this is full screen and the main titles/credits are cut off the screen. The content is pretty good; she's her usual funny self but the screen is displayed wrong.
2,It's scratched!,i love Sarah Silverman and I love Jesus is Magic but i just opened it and tried to play it and it won't play! I'm so disappointed!
5,Love It,"I went to the theatre with my sister and we had the best time laughing till we cried. Sarah says things most don't, her humor is witty and at times may make you cringe a little, (I had to look around because I didn't know who was next to me<;) That is why with the DVD you can watch in the safety of your own home...Enjoy!!!"
5,If you are on her wavelength...,"To understand Sarah Silverman, think of this: Some women don't like a guy to undress them from a distance with his eyes. Sarah Silverman would object to the same because, probably, she would rather he undressed her from a distance with his nose."
1,"I love Sarah Silverman, but this movie sucked.","I love Sarah Silverman and her show on Comedy Central, but this movie bored me. It's mostly her on a stage doing stand up comedy. I really thought it was going to be more of a movie. In between the stand up comedy there are musical numbers, all of which I have already seen on Youtube a billion times. I don't think Sarah is a very good stand up comedian, she just stands there being rigid trying to get the audience to laugh at her overplayed jokes. I even bought her book ""The Bedwetter"", and that book was sloppily put together and boring. And what was that random part in the beginning of the movie where Sarah wipes off a tear and that gay ginger catches it and jerks off with it? It wasn't even funny..........just awkward and randomly placed."
1,didnt laugh,"not once. didnt even smile. sure, her monologue was offensive in an unimaginative borrish way. not sure if that qualifies as controversial. the sketches were worse than her routine.there are a lot of really really bad female comics out there - SS stands out as one of the lamest."
4,Sarah is Adorably Offensive,"Sarah Silverman's comedy is primarily rooted in hy-larious topics like rape, AIDS, and the holocaust. She constantly mashes up the adorable and the horrifying in her routine.Unlike a lot of shock comedy, Sarah never comes across as angry. Her persona is always sunny and self-absorbed and ready to follow up a horribly racist comment with something even more awful... or with a song.Yes, a song. The movie includes several musical numbers. The songs are good for the most part, but best of all is the signature visual direction and musical arrangement of Liam Lynch.If you're not easily offended, you'll have a great time with this DVD."
3,mediocre,"Not sure what I was expecting with 'Jesus is Magic'...I've heard great things about Sarah Silverman as a comedian. At times, the standup was funny, but in general it was very crude and didn't strike me as that intelligent. I'm not sure what the appeal is with Silverman, maybe it's that a semi-attractive woman is saying such obscene things? I can't say that her routine was shocking, unless it's in the same sense that Howard Stern is 'shocking'...the crude obscene nature appeared to be the norm with her routine, so there were no dynamics in the rhythm of her comedy routine.The musical numbers were disturbing at best. They provided no added-value to the film. In fact, they were distracting and by the end of the film, I was fast forwarding through them."
1,noisy,"Disappointing, line inputs are noisy for a product described as ""high resolution"" with an optical out. I would not recommend this product."
2,"As advertised, but lousy sound","I bought this with reservation basis the mixed reviews of ""good enough"" and ""sucks"", and my experience was that it does not reproduce sound quality very well at all. I read about poor sound quality and to ""make sure the ground wire was used"", but ground wire or no ground wire the input from a good amplified tuner was very poor on the ouput side. In other words it ""sucks"". I paid $28 shipped to my house and tried it a few times in multiple configurations, but in the end, I gave it away. I'll try again for better sound, and please, I am not an audiophile in any sense. The reproduction is very, very, poor in my experience. I would rather say otherwise, but I can't."
2,save up for something better,it'll put sound throughit does everything it sayslow latency and allbut the sound quality is terriblenot usable for even an OK recording
2,Low volume output,"The output level is so low that for normal listening levels from my receiver, hum can be heard.I have found many others that have had the same complaint, and there does not seem to be any solution other than to use a preamp to raise the signal to achieve a satisfactory s/n ratio.$30 is cheap, but money spent on this device is wasted."
2,Can't control line in level,The UCA202 inhibited the use of the recording level bar in my Windows XP operating system. That bar selection was grayed out and not usable. I switched back to my old external sound card (with one bad channel) and the slide bar came back. The downloaded driver for the product did not change the problem.
4,Great Interface,Received my interface in about a week and it works great. The only problem I had with this interface is the drivers need to be updated through the manufactuer website. Other than that I can record my podcast with ease....check it out at [...]
4,very good for begginers,"good item & good price, great for the beginner. id recommend acquiring a mixer if you have extra peripherals. mine was a Behringer 802"
5,Perfect for live work.,"I own two of these Behringer boxes (they come in two modals) and use them with Sonor/cakewalk and an internal software sound modual (Roland Virtual sound Canvas) to play back midi files with my live two piece band. The sound through the PA (Soundcraft mixer and Mackie active speakers) is loud and very clear, in most cases, no eq needed. I guess it really revolves around your personal needs. For live performance these Behringer boxes are excellent and the price is a steal. I do not use it to record as my home recording is done on a stand alone DAW (Tascam 2488 24 track).If you are a live musician or a DJ using something like Virtual DJ these boxes are a great way to eliminate low level hum from a laptop and give you a dramtically better sound than most internal laptop sound cards."
5,Great purchase!,Great purchase..just want i needed for my Dj app on my ipad..for the price it was well worth it. I would recommend this product to anyone.
4,Generally Satisfied,"I have been using the device fairly regularly since my purchase last month and it generally has been working good. One feature I would like to see is a way to control the input volume. I can't seem to be able to do that on the source (tape player, CD, or phonograph). And using the Audacity software I can't seem to make adjustments to the input volume either. Otherwise, I am happy with the purchase."
2,"Worked well, until it didn't","I got this DAC as an off-board USB audio interface to connect my Mac to a pair ofAudioEngine A2desktop speakers. It worked well for about a year, but started to go bad. It was subtle at first -- a bit of buzzing or crackling. It finally got so bad that I threw this one away and got theEdirol UA-1EX USB Audio Interfaceinstead, which looks very similar but has held up over 2+ years.Spend a bit more money and get a higher quality audio interface."
2,Single track recording ok but has bad latency with multi-track,The price is right for this device however it really depends on what you plan to use it for. I have had several recording devices over the years and gone through 2 home recording studios. I was looking for something very small and simple to hook to my laptop and capture quick song ideas with multiple tracks. It worked great for single track recording. not the best quality recording but good enough. the problem came when i tried to lay down a second track. the latency was horrible. it's unusable as a multi-track device. I have ordered the other model UCA222 the ultra low latency version and I hope it works better. I really want to like this device because it is so simple to use. This is just not the device for multi-track recording.
3,Not for guitars,"I use this as a direct box for my bass guitar. however, it only picks up instruments with resonate really well (i.e. hollow-bodied instruments) Plugging in an electric guitar, and most other instruments though, does NOT work well. The sound it records with my shecter bass, however, is almost identical to the actual sound of the bass, which is nice. Also, the monitor on the device is terrible."
1,Does not work,"Ok I understand it now - I use Abelton Live 8 and thought this would be and easy, read cheap, interface to record some instruments with. WRONG! I am returning it. It does not work, has no drivers and is not detected on my Mac (my Mac finds everything). Bought the Focusrite unit instead. Got it to work on garage band but latency was miserable and so was hiss on recordings. Save your money and time. Buy the Focusrite interface or one of the others. Yes over $100 but you either want feedback, hiss and frustration or you want a smooth interface connection with good resonance. It also lacks 1/4 plug, one rca input, you need an addapter. Not what I thought I was getting - dumb me."
5,EXCELLENT PRODUCT FOR THE MONEY,"I needed a simple device to add a line-in to my laptop. I had tried an M Audio product, that was over twice the price of this unit, and it never worked right. The UCA 202 worked right out of the box with a three minute set up time. It is 16 bit; adequate enough for most applications. The sound is crystal clear. I bought mine from American Musical Supply. Would totally recommend this item."
3,U-Control UCA 202,"This product does not work in a Windows 7 operating environment. Apparently Behringer has opted to not update the driver at this time. As for other operating systems, it works very well in a Windows Vista system."
4,U-Control,"Does what it says, for a good price. No problems so far, no noise!! :D Only 16-bit thought. The label came of, right out of the box... good overall..."
4,Russianbz,This is a great little gadget (must have)if you like DJing and works great with Virtual DJ software. the price is reasonable too and up till now it's working great . . . I highly recommend it.
2,Lame,"I had high expectations for this device since I had little luck recording with my sound card or microphones an had had sucess with previous Behringer equipment. When I got this device and plugged it in, i noticed horrible buzzing coming from my audio output... no matter what i did, the buzzing would not go away. Not only is the buzzing annoying, but im in a death metal band, so there has to be distortion on my guitar, and this made my distortion pedal sound like "" tiny computers""... like in that Metalacalypse episode. Even when i mixed the sound through my mixer, it sounded like a digitech effects pedal, which im pretty sure everyone tries to avoid. And the fact that you cant plug any old guitar cable in it angers me..."
5,Good Deal,"This item came very quickly. It works great, I hooked it up to my mixer and laptop to record mixes. Good quality..."
3,Maybe,I bought this to eliminate ground hum from output on my laptop.It did not.I haven't tried it yet on input.I hope I can get it to work.
2,Old school meets new school,"I've done many recordings for many years, but all old school. I just couldn't seem to get this to work like the old devices. Not user friendly. It might be a good thing for some, but not for me."
5,It works great!,"Got this based on other reviews, especially one who took the time to really expound on it. I used it for recording a cassette to computer, but I really bought it to use to interface my mixing board with my computer. Should work just fine. The seller was fast, getting it to me over 2 weeks ahead of the projected arrival date.If you've used other Behringer equipment, you may or may not be impressed with their quality. Just remember, that although they may be engineered in Germany, they are made in China. Enuf said. This particular unit seems to be built pretty well, but time will tell."
3,"Worked, but dont use it for turntable recording","I made a mistake and bought this unit instead of the UFO202 model. I needed to ""burn"" some old albums to my laptop. The device worked fine, but it left a buzzing sound (like a fly caught in the corner of your window behind the curtains) on my recordings. I suspected this was due to the fact that this unit did not have the ground for my turntable to connect with (as comes with the UFO202). Accordingly, I bought the UFO202 model and all is well - the buzzing is gone and I am ripping my old vinyl albums with success (using free Audacity downloaded software). The UCA202 model worked ok and I suspect the buzzing noise was me using it for a purpose not intended for the device. If you want to burn albums to digital - get the UFO202 model."
4,Excellent for converting Vinyl,"After looking at $200 converters, I settled on the Behringer controller, mainly because of the price. I plugged it via RCA Audio cable into my Onkyo Tape 2 out port, and into the input on the device, and started recording. Extremely simple and amazing sound quality! Definitely buy! IT IS WORTH THE MONEY!"
5,"Great, and cheap!","I just got this product today, shipped directly from amazon, and it's a great product.I use it to record from my mixer. It's easy to use, and records in good quality.You can hear a little lower quality from the recording from the original song, but you have to really listen to music a lot to notice it. And I'm sure it will sound better once I pump up the recording settings, I have it at default at the moment. It can only sound better!Plug right in, hit record on my downloaded FREE Audacity, and it works like a charm."
1,died after 3 months,"I bought the Behringer UCA-202 hoping to DJ and record with it. It was working fine for about 3 months, then one day it just wouldn't turn on. Still haven't been able to get the light to turn on or my PC to recognize it is plugged into a USB port. Could use some help. Thanks."
