5,Highly rated,"Probably one of Melanie Griffith's best films, ""Pacific Heights"" gets the mood exactly right as it shows the pressure building up on a young couple who start out with ever so high hopes, only to find themselves in one helluva mess with their creepy tenant. The tension is well maintained throughout, and there is a surprisingly effective performance from Michael Keaton as the baddy."
5,Fantastic,"I love this movie. I first bought it when it came out in VCR tape. Had to get it on a DVD. First -rate acting, especially Michael Keaton. Everyone who is considering buying property to rent should see this movie FiRST! Amazing!"
5,An American in China,"Interesting book about doing business in China in the 1930'ies with also an eye for society, environment and culture. Colorful, informative and most entertaining map on Peking included. Excellent and very quick service."
4,with reference to the previous review,"The young border lord was named Thomas Kerr of Smailholm, later of Ferniehirst."
4,"Beautiful, high-quality toy","This is a well constructed and beautiful toy. The wood is smooth, the colors are bright, and my 5-month old loves it. I'm just happy that we don't have to put one of those ugly plastic contraptions in the middle of the living room! We just put down a quilt anywhere and it works. I have just one criticism: the beeswax finish, which is smooth and lovely, smells like urine. In fact, we thought the dog had peed somewhere until we figured out it was the play gym! I tried airing it outside and wiping it down with a damp washcloth, but no luck. Now that we know what the odor is, it is more tolerable, but I do explain it to visitors so they don't think my house smells like pee."
2,"Great movies, but I've seen better quality","I just got this dvd set with the Bob Hope Tribute Collection ""The road show series"" and have to say I am pretty disappointed with the quality. Both movies are pretty grainy and a few of the frames have glitches. I mainly got this dvd because of ""Road to Rio"". I already own a dvd with ""My Favorite Brunette"" and ""Road to Bali""Road to Bali/My Favorite Brunette. I bought this set thinking the quality would be much better then the version I owned and boy was I wrong! First chance I get I'm buying the single version of ""Road to Rio"". On another note Bob Hope Tribute Collection has amazing quality and I highly recommend it!Bob Hope Tribute Collection - The Road Show Series (The Road to Morocco / The Road to Singapore / The Road to Utopia / The Road to Zanzibar)"
2,Not soft-at all,"Not soft at all, twists up and shrinks horribly when washed (on cold even). Not a good buy even at this price."
5,Well Done,"In this short documentary, Larry Elder goes after the gun control issue in the style of Michael Moore and clearly comes out on top. He manages to expose some of the fraudulent claims of Moore and others in their crusade for gun control. That, simply put, is the synopsis of the program.I did not expect the program to be very good in the production value arena but I was pleasantly surprised. It was well done.The program is not overly long but it packs a punch in the time it has available."
5,Larry Elder is great,Get smacked in the face with some libertarian common sense. An excellent defense of the second amendment and another counter to Michael Moore's sensationalist nonsense.
5,The Sage from South Central Takes on a 'Big Fat Stupid White Man',"Larry, I know you read the reviews on Amazon--you read some on your show the other day. Just letting you know I pre-ordered the movie the first time I heard you say it was available. I'm a 19-year-old student at UC Irvine and, Larry, you're the only teacher I listen to. All these liberal loon professors spend their time in the classroom preaching Michael Moore's brand of illogical garbage. My recourse comes at 3 PM every day--Sage time. Keep making films and putting the liberals' feet to the fire. You're the best, Larry."
4,Truth Prevails,"Loved the video. I'm a regular talk radio listener of Larry, so I knew what to expect. The movie presents facts about guns and gun users that would probably surprise the passionate anti-gun liberal. The difference is very clear cut between the two film makers...Michael Moore's so called documentary was scripted, edited to change facts and presented incorrect information. I saw Moore interviewed where he laughed at his false information saying he was an entertainer, not a journalist. Whether you agree with Mr. Elder or not, at least he presents the facts. How rare these days!"
4,Michael & Me,Refreshing and informative! Nice to see something factual that also entertains for a change.
5,GREAT MOVIE FOR GUN LOVERS,"If you love guns, this is the movie for you. A great picture for revolver, rifle, shotgun and machine gun lovers of the world. Higly recommended."
2,Uneventful,"I watched this movie in an attempt to keep a balanced perspective of both liberal and conservative views. I wasn't convinced. Though Mr. Elder manages to bring in valid arguments, they are not delivered with a powerful punch. Instead, the viewer is left listening to mostly ""opinions."" The arguments, in case you're interested, are that statistics do not indicate that lawful gun owners commit numerous crimes, gun control laws do not reduce crime, and people might just need guns someday to defend themselves against their own government. I would have loved to have seen this latter point explored in depth (i.e., as to why this should be a genuine concern of citizens). As mentioned, however, the arguments are overshadowed by the endless droning of beliefs, as opposed to facts."
1,Plain wrong,"This film claims to be an unbiased look at gun control, but I would not be suprised if it has some sort of NRA funding backing it somewhere. In the end, it is just as loaded and biased as the filmmaker alluded to in the title. It is a response to ""Bowling for Columbine"" that feels more like damage control. It is permeated by the stench of the same old argument, ""guns don't kill people, people do."" Well, they sure do make it easier, don't they! The director of this documentary has a very obvious agenda. After the shooting at Virginia Tech, and with all the violence in our society, it is really irresponsible not to at leat ponder the idea of some sort of restricitons on gun ownership. There are people out there, however, that will not change their minds. For those that are unwilling to consider any reasonable arguements, then I suppose this is the film for you!"
2,An ok documentary with flawed logic,Michael and me is an ok documentary with flawed logic by some of the interviewees. Take Jane Doe who seems to blame the government's 10 days waiting period for her rape. Instead she should blame the rapist or fate.Also Elder looses respect when he attacks Moore. Instead he should've focuses on gun control instead of throwing mud.
1,Typical.,"Attack the messanger instead of addressing the issue. Neither original nor creative, what we have here is a rip-off of Moore to trash Moore.If Elder had bothered to pay attention to Bowling, he would have understood that it is not the number of guns which is central to the issue, it is the constant feelings of fear and anxiety that is played up by government and greedy corporations."
4,Do I Really Need This?,"Few people will dispute the widespread American tendency to accumulate. This tendency is known as the ""rodent propensity."" In my neighborhood of 3-car garages most of them provide at least a third of the space for the storage of stuff that will never be used again. The book, Scaling Down, by two authors who travel the country conducting seminars on our natioinal tendency to compete with packrats, offer valuable suggestions in scaling down and helpful criteria in confronting the tyranny of the over-abundance of ""things."" Not least, the auhors provide a realistic assessment of how to deal with the delicate question of ""who gets what?"" in the final distribution of our worldly possessions. An excellent review of an issue we will all face, now or later."
5,Miss my Ranch,"I have looked all over for this product. Hidden Valley changed recipe to use regular milk and it is just not the same. Now that summer tomatoes are ripe, I can't wait to have the original again!Try adding Bleu Cheese crumbles to this, MMMMM!"
1,CONTAINS MSG!,"Hidden Valley needs to remove this from their products. MSG is the 2nd ingredient in this, which means it contains a lot. MSG is poison and causes cancer. I will never buy another one of their products as long as they keep using this."
5,Great double CD of must have music,Great CD. Makes you feel like you're on vacation. The songs are classic trop rock.
5,"MM In Margaritaville, The Key West Party CD, and Key West, Island Of Dreams Are All You Need","This great greatest hits collection and Jimmy's buddy Bill Jabanoski's The Key West Party CD and his new one Key West, Florida Island of Dreams are all you need to put on your CD changer to have everyone at your summer outdoor party feeling good all day. Oh yeh. Don't forget about the full keg, plenty of rum, and keeping the blender running."
2,I sense greed in Margaritaville!,"No doubt, Jimmy Buffett had some nice, catchy songs, but this sprawling 2-Disc set simply overwhelms the casual fan with too much material. Devout ""Parrotheads"" already own this stuff, though they'll inevitably want to complete their collection.""Meet me in Margaritaville"" is Unnecessary. While many artists historically get snubbed by songs left off ""Greatest Hits"" and ""Best of"" compilations, Jimmy Buffet is no such person. Skip this, For the all-you-can-eat value, ""Songs you know by heart"" takes the cake, no pun intended. Get that instead, It's the only Jimmy Buffett album worth owning."
2,"Same Old, Same Old","Buffett has had about 5 hits over the years. His concerts are amazing. But to sit around and listen to all the songs that all have the same sound is boring, boring, boring."
1,Not Pleased,"I am so happy you sent me this e-mail. I purchased this CD for my brother for Christmas and you sent me the wrong CD - I received something called WHORACLE by IN FLAMES which is not what I ordered and I am really disappointed and I would really like it if you would send me what I ordered, which is the Jimmy Buffett CD - THE ULTIMATE COLLECTION......... Please get back to me.Thank you,Rosane Cassella"
1,A spoon,I have heard these songs over and over and over. Every time I do I want someone to take a spoon and jam it in my ears in the hope that I will not have to hear it any more. I would rather stab myself in the groin than listen to this man any more.
1,Crap,"I agree with the Boykin. Buffett is only good for hippies and old people, and really, who cares about hippies and old people?"
5,Excellent Buffett Primer!,"An excellent collection of Buffett tunes, including several new recordings... The two brand-new tracks are unfortunately covers (who needs another cover of Everybody's Talkin', anyway?). However, no big deal. The new recordings, as he says in the introduction, are like a new coat of paint. Nice to see School Boy Heart, one of my favs, open disc two. At least one track from every album (save Far Side...) is on this 2-disc set. An excellent addition to your collection -- if you're not alreay a Parrothead this will make you one."
3,"My husband loves this CD, I don't","My husband enjoys this CD and plays it frequently. Buffett apparently writes most of his own material. He has a pleasant, distinctive voice and some of the songs are witty and pleasant to listen to. Most are are novelty songs-- just for fun, not for playing over and over and finding more and more to appreciate."
3,review,Some of the songs skip but the rest of it was okay. I would buy it again maybe a few dollars cheaper
1,"Jimmy is still the 'King', but this is nothing new...","""Meet Me In Margaritaville"" is a good collection of Buffett material. The only pitfall is that most of devout Parrotheads already have the songs that are included in this set. Just how many times is Jimmy going to include ""Cheeseburger In Paradise"" on an album? The song is on two of his live albums and nearly every 'Hits' package he's put out. Most Parrotheads will be happy with the live versions of ""Holiday"", ""The Pascagoula Run"", and ""Son Of A Son Of A Sailor"", but nearly everything else is previously released material. A better deal would be to buy the MCA boxed set - ""Beaches, Boats, Bars, and Ballads"". Mr. Buffett should be putting out completely new albums, and leaving the compilations for his retirement."
3,"Get Tuesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays","So I had Tuesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays already, and I loved it so much that I got this album too, because Tuesdays didn't have all the famous Buffett songs, just most of them. But let me tell you, Tuesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays is by far better than this album. While this is indeed an ultimate collection, it's just not as FUN. Some of the songs that are dancing-around-and-singing-at-the-top-of-your-lungs-worthy on Tuesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays are just snooze-worthy on this album. Unless you really have to have a particular song that's on this album, get Tuesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays, because Tuesdays is really fun, while Meet Me in Margaritaville is just background music."
4,"Good, but not quite great","Gotta knock a star for the mostly inferior re-recordings (which resulted in the abcense of the superior orignial versions). I would have included ""Banana Republics"" or ""12 Volt Man"" instead of ""Creola"", for example-but that's really splitting hairs. Overall, a good collection of Jimmy Buffett songs, although it may be a little heavy for less serious JB fans."
5,"jimmy is the man...even his sad songs are happy , inuendo?",all of jimmys' songs seem to be of something happy. then you hear the words and they sorrow out a bit but the beat is always upbeat and happy. theres no one like him. his sad songs some how feel happy.
2,It had some scratches when it was 100%,It had scratches all over it but it still played. Still dissapointed because it was 100% and I thought it would be in perfect condition???
5,Perfect CD For A Buffett Newbie,"As I stated in an earlier review I am not a hardcore Jimmy Buffett fan. I have heard his music on the radio and I enjoyed hearing it. I do remember hearing his song ""Changes in Latitudes Changes in Attitudes"" on the radio on a summer day and somehow my mind was somewhere in a different part of the world. It was during the last Christmas season where I was hearing a song from his Christmas Island CD. I had to have that one but I did see this CD and it looked appealing. I read some reviews that were helpful so I ordered the item. I love the CD. It has the songs I'm familar with but it has songs I've never heard before. Overall the CD is a good one. All the songs are good but some are better than others. I'm not going to try and describe any of them. For someone who just wants to have a collection of songs by Jimmy Buffett this is the CD to get. I don't think one can go wrong with this item."
1,Don't even think about it,"It all comes down to common sense: if you stick this in your flute after you play, well, it just traps the moisture in there. The moisture eats the pads away, the rough fuzz rubs against them and damages them even more, and you've just ended worse than you started. Flutists and repairmen agree--Stick to the traditional cleaning rod and cloth!"
1,"Unhealthy, and very costly for your instrument","I have been playing flute for several years, and teaching flute for 6, and in my professional opinion and that of other professionals I've had the pleasure of talking to, these are absolutely AWFUL to use in a flute. Yes, they absorb the moisture from the pads, but upon leaving it IN the flute, they just redistribute the bacteria, and any moisture that didn't evaporate. This can result in untimely repairs and pad replacements to your instrument.More than once the bacteria from these little fluffy wands made me sick again after I'd had a bout of cold or flu. They are NOT a good investment for your instrument.If you MUST use these, DO NOT LEAVE IT IN YOUR FLUTE. They are fine for cleaning, but don't let it sit in your flute. Let it dry before putting it away because the moisture contained in it helps to harbor the bacteria.Take it from a flute teacher with entirely too much experience with these, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THESE."
5,"Es un producto efectivo, me ha funcionado muy bien.","Es un producto efectivo, me ha funcionado muy bien. Es justamente lo que había estado necesitando para realizar un mantenimiento más completo a mi flauta traversa."
4,Fine Product,There really isn't much to say... it's a run-of-the-mill flute pad-saver. Nothing particularly special about this item. The price is fair. The product does what it's supposed to do. That's it.
3,don't leave it in,"I use a flute pad saver to swab-out my sax mpc and neck. Most repair-persons don't recommend these be left in the instrument. But i think they make a decent swab if, that is, they don't shed."
5,Sweet baroque trumpet music!,"It was the first disc that acquaints me with this trumpeter 2 years ago and i was suprised by that the disc brought me more than i ever dared expect from it, probably the artist is not active enough like a professional classical specialist to establish an impression to me as a classical artist from which I would like to expect more and more but this one is stunningly wonderful classical cd,although its sound quality is not preferable to me:the orchestre sounds too timid,afterall the trumpeter Mr Marsalis does not fail in retain my interest in the disc.well I cannot say more for trumpet is a complete musically stranger to me.if there are more classical trumpet music discs coming up.I would look forward to this name."
5,The Best of Wynton Marsalis,This was my first Wynton Marsalis CD and will always be the best. I love his trumpet music more than anything else I listen to.
2,"Good, except for the Brandenburg","Wynton definitely plays these pieces with a modern touch, and this recording could never be construed for a period performance. For mot of the performances Wynton may plays beautifully, and his modern style is mostly a matter of taste.The Brandenberg concerto, however, is a different story. This recording is simply ridiculous. The overpowering trumpet playing is completely wrong to the extent that it is no better than missing notes. Ironically, the trumpet part is emphasized to show off Wynton's playing, but part of the difficulty of the Brandenburg concerto is being about to play the high notes softly and balancing with the rest of the ensemble.Overall, the balance in the Brandenburg concerto is so terrible it's hard to give this album more than 2 stars."
3,Quiet now,"Recording quality: excellentRepertoire: very goodPerformance: fairNow that he is famous he can do whatever he wants? NO NO NO....Mr. Marsalis dedicated this recording to all the trumpet players that have gigs every sunday in church and are forced to play lower than the choir.That explains why he plays everything so loud, but it is not an excuse to get out of the style. The Brandenbug Concerto is a Concerto Grosso, not a solo part. Mr. Marsalis is in the wrong path this time.The repertoire is very good, as it introduces unreleased material.The arrangements are cheesy and just show how they can be influenced by a commercial point of view.This recording is worth only by the extense repertoire.I would not recommend this recording to a serious musician."
4,good lighter listening,This is a pleasant CD with fairly light Schubert. One can imagine listening to it at a fair or some other open air gathering. The sound quality is very good. Certainly this is not an 'esential' disc but it is enjoyable.
2,An average book.,"Too much is written about the commander of a small British corps that supported the Spanish guerillas, and not enough about the commanders of the greatest armies like Suvorow, Archduke Charles, Davout. Regarding the maps, Borodino appears to be a mere skirmish in comparison to those battles where Chandler's compatriots took part."
1,The Thin Chandler,"I am interested in the German King Legion, Polish and Swiss troops at Peninsula. I was deeply surprised at the author's description of the battle at Fuengirola where the Poles trashed British troops. Nothing is more misleading. Please compare this to G. Nafziger's ""Saxons and Poles"" and to other authors.I think this author has tried to specialize in too many topics, (see his other books mentioned on amazon.com)and that this is the side effect.I am also disappointed in the maps. These great battles appear like skirmishes when compared to those which were fought by the British."
1,One of 200 Chandler's books.,"This is the recipe a la Chandler: good pictures, poor, and with errors text, some maps. Rush, rush. I have the impression that author wants to finnish quickly this book, so he can write about chess or farming, or angels (see amazon.com). Yes, I looked for Fuengirola, battle where the Poles trashed the Britons completely. This is outrageous what Chandler writes about this battle."
4,Great Product for a Bad Habit.,"For the holidays, I usually like to go to my favorite hotel to get lost. Unfortunately, I'm a smoker and the rooms I'm booked into smell like they just had a poker game. I decided to get this for my latest trip.Within 3 hours after plugging it in, the smell left and even after I had a cigarette, the odor was gone within an hour. I'll probably leave the room smelling better than when I checked in.Great product. And yes, I will eventually quit smoking."
4,Excellent product,I've used this in rooms with pet odors and even milk spills on carpet that needed a cleaning job that I couldn't get to until the next day. It really controls the odor! I love it.
4,Febreze Odor removal,"It works just like it claims, but even with the discounted price at Amazon I think it is very overpriced."
2,Fan is not quiet,"The fan volume is like that of a very loud desktop computer, an xbox, or a refrigerator. Not recommended if you don't want to add additional white noise to your house. I can hear this thing whirring away from the next room."
5,Big Difference with paint fumes,"We bought a toddler bed off Craig's List and spray-painted it to match my son's room. But, even after airing out in the back yard for two days, his room reeked of paint fumes as soon as we moved it inside. I was very concerned about the VOC's. We plugged in one of these little suckers right next to his bed, and VOILA! In a matter of hours the room was fresh. We liked it so much that we purchased another for our sunroom (which tragically smells like our landscaper's pesticide every time it rains)."
4,"Works Well in ""Dead-Air"" Corner","I purchased one of these air cleaners for a bottom-of-the-stairs area where there is poor air circulation and where bad odors tend to linger. It cleaned the air quickly. The unit can be a little noisy, so I just use the handy on/off switch on the side to turn it on whenever I notice the odors building up. I then turn it off a couple of hours later when the odor is gone. I thought the night light feature was silly at first, but since the location can be darker than the surrounding areas, the light has turned out to be a nice feature. Overall, it suits its purpose well."
5,GREAT FOR LITTERBOX ODORS,"I put one of these next to my two busy litterboxes, and it does an effective job of eliminating odors. Surprising for something so small and inexpensive. One filter lasts me about one month. Recommended."
2,VERY IFFY,"THE COVER WILL NOT STAY ON I 'M CONSTANTLY CHANGING FILTERS CAUESE IT DOS'NT SEEM TO WORK , AT FIRST IT DID.THE FILTERS THAT WERE RECOMMENDED DO NOT FIT AT ALL!!!"
4,A good compendium of various alternative healing techniques.,"This is one of the few books I've ever read that attempts to explain the mechanism of various alternative healing technologies in terms that make some sense to a scientist. His model of the universe is essentially that of the Theosophists or other metaphysical groups. Unlike some more popular books on similar subjects, he actually has some new material. Unfortunately, the editing job is terrible and the book is choppy and repetitive. For example, he describes the properties of water treated by a ""healer."" This is excellent. Then about 100 pages later he revisits the same subject, repeats much of what you read earlier, and adds a new piece of information."
4,Leaving Earth,"Every page of this interesting book is packed with details of the evolution of the Russian manned space program. It is very well researched and Robert Zimmerman does an excellent job describing the interaction between on-the-ground politics and space science. The stories of life, survival and endurance on the space stations is facinating. This book is a must read for anyone who is interested in the history of man's quest for conquering the many problems of surviving in the harsh space environment."
4,A History of the First Space Stations,"Zimmerman's book is the detailed story of the first space stations. Anyone interested in manned spaceflight shouldread it. My criticisms would be of two sorts; First, he speculates too much about the politics behind the decisions. I especially object to the all too american right-wing bias in his judgements. Secondly, he fails to make connections with the concurrent unmanned space research. ""Exploration"" is not humans going places and doing sightseeing. Exploration is doing science and doing science is more about unmanned spaceflight."
2,A missed opportunity,"Whilst the content is exclusive, the editorial well and knowledgeably written, and providing a facinating insight into the political and cultural mores of the United States through these originally impressive still lives, this book is ultimately a disappointment. The idea that you can take photographs that are astonishing for their sheer size and scale (their whole raison d'etre) and then publishing them in a book smaller than a regular A5 hardback is utterly absurd, presenting them with a fold in nearly every picture and losing any possible sense of scale. The publishers have missed a great opportunity here."
4,"Beautiful photography, good critical essays","This compilation of Kodak's Coloramas is a great start and I hope there will be more scholarship available on the subject. The essays are suprisingly critical and provide some good insights on the societal/cultural implications of the advertisments. I only wish there were more of them. Also, this is not a complete collection of the images, which would also be great. Overall, a nice coffee table book, just wish there was more of everything."
4,New band needs more attention,"With The Gentry's synth-pop style and aggressive lyrics, it's amazing this band isn't more widely appreciated.From Portland, Ore., The Gentry created their debut from home, and despite a low production budget, they sound crisper than many bands with a major record label.""Sweet Gossip TV,"" is a refreshing album with its hard-hitting lyrics about the scourge of pop-culture. The name itself tells you this is not going to be another fluff CD singing about break-ups and the world's unfairness.Most of the songs are slow and intuitive, great for loud music to play while avoiding homework. Each song is slightly different in style and speed depending on the story being told.Reminiscent of Euro-poppers Eiffel 65, The Gentry has a heavy synthesized sound with voice distortion and keyboards.They sing about sex, drugs and the media, but don't muster enough momentum in each track to keep the listener engaged to the end."
3,Coral Reef Animals of the Indo-Pacific,"Good book for unusual species of crabs, starfish, shrimp, jellyfish that are not seen in the marine hobby. I would have like a little more information/description on some of the species depicted, but an overall good book for species in the area."
4,Better have a math PHd,"Very mathematical oriented, not at all intuitive. Of limited use to financial quants without extensive formal training in advanced mathematics."
5,Alternative Firing Techniques,"What a wonderful book. As a ceramic sculptor, I appreciate the Raku, Pit, Barrel and Saggar firing methods. It gives one enough of the technical details of the how-to's of each of the firing methods (and how to build a raku kiln, and barrel and pit kilns) to get one started. It also ""fires"" up one's imagination to expand the contents of the book and to push your work to another level. This book presents beautiful examples of what ""Alternative Firing Techniques"" can produce."
3,raku kiln,"Has some real nice photos, a few good Raku ideas that make the book worth wile.Gives the average person a very good overview in bare bones terms, and the experienced a couple of techniques to try.If you just looking at building a Raku kiln. I have found equivalent or better designs on the web. Enjoyable to read for a tech manual. Inexpensive well worth the price."
5,terrific!,"I was so hungry for the information provided by this book,I bought it up fast.It's exactly what I needed,it has basic and user friendly info,a really good value for what it costs.I took it to the studio,and had others look at it and drool,begging me for info as to where they could get a copy.I am really glad I have it!!!"
1,Great premise. No story.,"This book starts with a great premise, and then wanders around doing nothing with it -- finally concluding with the obvious person having done the obvious thing. Too bad the author went the road most travelled. It could have been a really interesting romance and character exploration. Instead, the ""mystery"" and ""thriller"" aspects are a total waste. And lastly, the lead character just simply isn't that likeable. Disappointing at best."
4,A great read about second chances!,Carl Rooney seems to be a lonely man who has had numerous failed relationships. Then his high-school sweethart shows up one night throwing pebbles at his window just like they did when they were in high school. He then finds that she has been in an accident and doesn't remember anything past the age of 16. This brings out the chivalry in him and he decides to help her and in the process attempt to rekindle their relationship and hope she will forgive him for past mistakes.I found this book thrilling from the start and I really hope there will be a sequel to this book!
1,NOT HAPPY,The tape was digital and would not play in cd player.This information was not indicated. I will not purchase from them again.
4,2nd Disc Problems,I love the CD (disc 1). I have purchased the CD twice now. In each case disc 2 of the CD was blank. Is the second CD blank? Should I go for a 3rd CD?
1,The History of Morrisville as seen through the eyes of a pedophile.,"This guy has been accused of molesting students. Something he forgot to mention in his history of the town.From the Burlington Free Press:""In the spring, (Superintendent) Wrend placed Bryer on administrative leave but never reported him to the Vermont Education Department for possible license suspension. In a letter, she threatened to seek suspension unless Bryer agreed to discuss leaving the district.He complied and signed an agreement guaranteeing him full pay during his three-month leave, a job reference and a promise from school officials to frame his departure in ""positive"" terms. In exchange, Bryer agreed to resign effective June 30 and not sue the district.He quickly found a teaching job in Colchester.""Read more: [...]This is how Morrisville has been dealing with these problems for decades. That would have made one hell of a chapter in his book."
1,really lame movie!!!,"I was expecting a fun, romantic comedy-- and this is the complete opposite of that... I gave it one star only because Harry Connick Jr is so cute..."
1,Lisa from MN,"I normally love romantic comedies, I take them for what they are, but not when they insult people who live in certain areas. In general, Minnesotans' don't talk like this. There might be a few in Sunburg, MN (less then 10 and I think I'm being generous). This movie made us look like a bunch of rejects from Norway, I was very insulted to say the least. Sadly it wasn't even made in Minnesota, it was made in Canada where they say ""Aay?"" alot. Since I moved out to western MN, I have picked up saying ""Heh?"" (the Canadian Aay habit), but I don't say ""Ya know? or ""You betcha!"" I guess you could say this is a sore spot for me, I just find it so annoying, wasn't Fargo enough? This movie wasn't even funny enough to get passed this inaccurate dialect."
4,Who talks like that?,"I live in Minnesota, and I would like to know who talks like that?No one that I have met!!The movie supposeably takes place in New Ulm, Minnesota, polka city, but filmed elsewhere.I suppose the protrayal of the small town folks, in the way they talked, was partof the humor.Renee Zellweger is great in this movie. She played a big city girl to a T. She came acrossas a cut-throat, there to do her job. She never suspected that she would like these people though,whose jobs she would have to cut.Humor was throughout the movie. The romance was a little lame, Otherwise, all in all,I enjoyed the movie."
4,"""Oh for crying in the beer cheese soup!""","I took my parents to see this movie in the theaters, and we all loved it. I'm from a small town in Minnesota, not unlike the portrayal of New Ulm (a real town, unlike Golden Girls' Rose's (played by Betty White) St. Olaf) I think to truly appreciate this movie you need to be from Minnesota, otherwise it's just another dumb rom-com. But when you get the jokes from the inside it can't be beat!Four stars for a somewhat realistic and 100% funny look at small town Minnesota life. I'm knocking it one star from being a typical rom-com, which people who aren't from the middle of nowhere in the frozen tundra might not get."
2,Disappointing,"Female yuppie from South Beach falls for life in small-town Minnesota. The storyline is anything but new and the outcome predictable, but that is what I expect from something labeled ""romantic comedy"". Unfortunately, unlike Sandra Bullock or Diane Keaton, Renee Zellweger cannot pull off the role of corporate executive; there is absolutely no chemistry between her and Harry Connick; and unless you consider stereotypes and cliches funny, there is not much to laugh about.It wasn't a bad movie for the day after Christmas but overall unconvincing and too annoying to be entertaining."
3,"Predictable, predictable, predictable!","I felt the only thing that didn't happen, that I was expecting, was for Lucy Hill's car to plunge through the ice. Other than that, every other plot twist was predictable.Lucy Hill (played by Renee Zellweger) is a driven corporate executive from Miami, and she is sent to a chilly Minnesota town to modernize the food processing plant there for producing a new product line.The reception she receives is chilly as well.The clash between suave Lucy and the bumpkin locals is the storyline, and as Lucy's stay progresses, she begins to understand them, and they begin to respect her. Add the romantic fling and the misunderstandings, and there you go: New In Town!I did like the crow-hunting sequence."
2,So-So,"Glad I didn't pay for this at the theater. This is a dull, predictable, cutesy movie. Not so funny. Not so interesting. Could have been alot better!!!!!"
2,"Oh, Renee....","How saddened I was to see that two of my favorite actors chose to do this film that was so disappointing. I watched it with three friends, all of whom are romantic comedy and drama movie types, and we finally shut it off after repeatedly telling one another, ""We'll give it a chance"" and ""Maybe it'll get better"" for over 45 minutes. The best word to describe this film, in my opinion: DULL."
2,Ho hum...,"I think this a cute movie, but it's EXTREMELY predictable. So much so that I ended up going into the kitchen to cook some food about a quarter of the way thru, turning my head every few minutes or so towards the screen to see if I missed any surprises. Nope. While the predictability was mildly annoying, the attempt at a Minnesotan accent was pure comedy. I've lived in Minnesota for many years, and I can honestly say that I have never, ever heard ANYONE talk like that. I suppose it's meant to be a spoof, but it became very annoying after the first few lines. I think THAT is maybe the main reason I left the room. Anyways, it's a cute movie at least. The story is simple yet sweet, not my personal style, but it was OK."
2,Predictable,"This movie would have been a lot better without Harry Connick Jr. I am not sure when he became an actor or why for that matter, but I really don't think he matched up well with Zellweger or the others. There are a few scenes that are very funny (without Connick). But the movie as a whole doesn't stand up to the idea of the story and it could have been a lot better. What I admire most about the film is that they shot it in Winnipeg, Canada in bitterly cold weather. And for that reason alone the film deserves four stars. But I only gave it two for the actors ability to pull their character through each scene and story development (or lack thereof)."
3,Cute Movie,Very predictable but cute at the same time. I like Renee Zellweger and enjoy seeing her fall in love on screen which is something she does the great majority of the time in her movies. The movie was ok.
3,New In Town,"Don't Usually Buy A Movie Unless I've Seen It First, Took A Chance. Nice Story And Funny."
4,What a neat movie!,"Big city lady meets a town full of giving, kind and thoughtful people who all work in the factory she is sent to by her corporation to reconfigure. Funny stuff in here. Liked it alot."
4,Culture clash,"Renee Zellweger plays an up-and-coming executive from a Miami-based company who is sent to Minnesota to downsize employees and make a plant more efficient. Going North is a decided shock to her and she is amused at the locals who enjoy ice fishing, scrapbooking, and tapioca. Harry Connick Jr. plays the head of the plant's labor union and, predictably, he and Zellweger clash. Siobhan Fallon Hogan is wonderful as Zellweger's secretary and she catches the Minnesota accent and attitude perfectly, while giving respect to the humanity of the character. Yes, this film is a predictable chick flick, but it has three wonderful actors and it takes the viewer on an enjoyable ride."
3,LEFT ME COLD,Renee is number one with me but this was so formulatic I could have said the lines. With such a cast I expected better.
2,Uninspired,"This is a dreary movie shot on the cheap. The film is based on an unimaginative, predictable and stereotypical script, most actors, including Connick, do not act but rather 'parody' their roles and at times this 'comedy' is almost painful to watch. The film is condescending, treats adults (the targeted audience) as children.Zelwegger is OK, but the continuous pursing those pretty heart-shaped lips is simply not enough to distract from what is a lazy, opportunistic, badly scripted and badly directed film."
2,OK movie,"I love Rene Z. but this film lacked spunk. I can say at least I saw it, but it left alot to the imagination, pretty dry movie in my book"
1,Wait for the Blu-ray disc to get fixed,"The authors of the DVD lockout controls from the viewer. You will be FORCED to watch commercials you have no interest in.The menu system is poorly done and difficult to navigate.The movie is not bad, obviously NOT filmed in Minnesota.The (pointless) copy protection prevented this movie from playing on some of my Blu-ray players.Does NOT come with a digital copy. Does NOT come with a standard definition DVD."
2,Purchase at your own risk.,"I love this movie, so I was very dissapointed to have found flaws in the disk half-way through the movie. I will attempt to get satisfaction from the seller, but caution anyone purchasing from this vendor."
1,RUN! DON'T WALK,"This was beneath the talent of Harry Connick, Jr. and Renee Zellweger. Poor script, contrite story, non dimensional characters. There were only three scenes that I can say were genuinely funny. Other than that it was predictable and incomplete in plot and story line.You find yourself wondering ""where did that come from?"" There is a lack of character development that is frustrating. Its like they wanted to rush to the conclusion and leave you to write the map as to how they got there.Disappointing."
1,New in Town,"In this fish-out-of-water romantic comedy, Renee Zellweger stars as a hotshot executive who's sent to the Land of 10,000 Lakes to oversee layoffs at one of her company's factories; there, she falls for the local union rep and learns about the strange customs of small-town Americans. New in Town's timely premise and winning leads are no match for the film's weather-beaten, cliched script, which tries way too hard to be uplifting."
5,the product works!,I have been using this product for years. You use to go into cvs and buy it and they couldnt keep it on the shelves. now its not available. It does control appetite and you will lose at least 2-5 pounds. I would get about 3 bottles every summer to kick start my weight loss. I kept one in my purse and put it on at work every 2 hours. You have to put it on every 2 hours to get the full benefit. One Sunday i sat on the couch and put it under my chin all day when i woke up monday everyone at work said WOW! what have you been doin. I recommeneded it to all my female co-workers.
1,BodyLift,I dont think this product is able to do what it promisses.I could not lose my appetite or weight wearing this product as indicated.
3,Okay Product,"I thought this would make my hair appear smoother and less dry, which it really didn't, but it did give me a little bit of shine and prepared it for flat-ironing. It also has a nice minty-chocolate smell."
5,Cargo Bar,"This cargo bar adjusts to fit perfectly in my 2007 GMC Yukon, I received it within three days of ordering, installation was very simple, I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a cargo bar for a large SUV."
5,A great overview of soccer history.,"Unlike other soccer books which can be narrow in scope and range, Murray's book attempts to take us beyond the borders of South America and Europe and examines soccer all over the world. It also examines political and social affiliations attached to the game. The appendix has major soccer disasters covered,tragedies involving players,major soccer grounds,FIFA membership,Soccer at the Olympic Games before 1930,The Growth of the World Cup,and The Growth of Various Youth Tournaments. It also has a useful Glossary which is a must for any observer, casual or hardcore fan of the game. It would be a good introductory book for someone learning about soccer history because it has plenty of useful anecdotes that illustrates the game's colorful and controversial history."
4,I'm hooked,"I just finished Court Martial, my first Sven Hassel book and I am absolutely ready for the rest of them. Porta, Tiny, Barcelona - all rough around the edges but a very likable group of Nazi-hating German soldiers - sounds like an oxymoron, doesn't it? - I'm so glad this is a series.Court Martial was all over the place, from the ruins of Berlin to the frozen Russian front - are they all like this? I don't mind, I loved it and couldn't put it down. Quite brutal, other times laugh-out-loud funny. 4 1/2 stars"
3,Okay movie for 8-12yr olds. Maybe a bit slow for adults.,Good tween age movie. Adults may be a bit bored but as always these family films each good moral values and doing the right thing. It is actually kind of hard to find these days.
3,It dosnt work,"i listened to this disk 2 times and I still feel dum. iT does not work, save you're money."
2,Dont' buy it for the main title,"I agree with the main review. I saw this special on television - BORING!!! The saving grace to this DVD like many of the other Peanuts DVDs is the most of them have 1 to 2 of the older shows remastered and on the DVD. I will puchase this item when it comes out, but I am mainly after the other two Peanuts shows that are on it.Now I just wish they would release the 4 Peanuts movies on DVD!!"
5,A fun trip down memory lane!,"When I found ""She's a Good Skate, Charlie Brown"" on Amazon Instant Video, I was so excited. I loved watching it as a child, and my oldest loves all things Charlie Brown and Peanuts. This video did not disappoint. He loves it too!"
3,You're A Good Sport Charlie Brown,I thought the amount of time in Snoopy's initial tennis game was too long. My small son's response was to hit eject. But as a Peanut's fan I still like the movie's premise and lessons. And hopefully as my son gets a little older he will come to like it too and be able to watch the whole movie.
5,the music,"i bought this video because i remembered liking the score when i was a kid. it's the not the typical peanuts theme music and the score has held up with time; it includes irresistable use of symthesizers. the humor is typical peanuts cleverness and the animation, particularly on the characters' faces, is fine."
5,Brilliant little movie!!,"I am so happy to see this movie on Amazon. I saw it once a few years ago and it has stuck with me ever since. It's sweet, funny, and the characters are completely endearing. Love the trailer park and all it's quirky residents. Can't wait to own my own copy!K. Rydell"
4,Entertaining and Funny!,A great Indie film. Love movies with quirky characters and this movie has quite a few! The animation is brilliant!
5,Great gift,Bought this as a gift for my future mother-in-law. She loved the scent and the price was just amazing; much cheaper than we could find it at any store.
2,smell not good,"This perfume looks darker than normal (mine is dark gold as opposed to bright gold). Also, the smell of the perfume I received is less Revlon-like, so it's not the ""Revlon Fields"" I've come to love. It's very difficult to find this perfume in stores, but I'll have to continue searching."
3,"Holds bottle securely, won't last.","I have had two of these and both broke after about 5k to 10k miles. For the casual cyclist this is probably fine, but if you are some one who bikes a lot you are better of getting something a little sturdier. To be fair to planet bike, there is a trade off between reliability and how securely the bottle is hold. This cage is designed so it is split down the middle enabling it to snugly hold bottles of slightly varying sizes. The trade of is that the holder will break sooner. If you want a ""split down the middle"" holder you are probably better of getting one made of a more forgiving material such as plastic or steel."
2,"Great cages, while they lasted...","I purchased two of these cages for my father's bike. He used them and loved them since he got them, but during a ride (we were together) just 7 months later, one of his cages came apart at the mounting bracket welds. He was left with a bottle and half of the cage in his hand. The mounting bracket was still mounted to the bike. We pitched the cage and he put the bottle in his back jersey pocket for the rest of the 50 miles, but what a bummer this was. This cage saw light use, too, as he rides a couple of times a week. These cages didn't even get as much use as some on my bike would. Moral of the story, for $7 bucks a piece, buy something that is going to last instead of this. You can find full carbon bottle cages on ebay for 20-25 shipped for the pair and they will last a lot longer than these will."
1,Broke after third ride.,The water bottle cage broke after three short mountain bike trips. I didn't run in to anything or stress it in any way and it just fell off while riding a straight line. I don't think it's meant for the turbulence of mountain biking.
2,Aesthetics are nice...functionality...not so great,"We purchased four of these because of the cool looking design. They do look nice on your bike. However; we had to send back one because the plastic button broke during shipping. We thought that was a fluke, but now I think they are just a poorly designed. Of the four bottle cages we ended up with, only two of them survived over a year. The other two split down the center. Not only are the plastic buttons fragile, but the welding seems to be hit and miss."
4,"Holds well, owned 2, both have broken though","I bought 1 of these cages. It held the water bottle nicely...but after a year, the soft aluminum broke right on the weld. Planet Bike has good customer service though and replaced the broken cage because they agreed that it shouldn't break on the weld. BUT...the replacement cage broke in the same place (on the weld) after about the same amount of time (~1 year). I wouldn't buy these again...but I would like to commend Planet Bike on their customer service."
2,Split Top is Design Flaw,"The cage looked nice, which Is the reason I purchased it, but the split top makes it susceptible to bending and eventual breakage. I found that if I hadn't tied my pant legs down that they would occasionally catch on the cage, and this ended up breaking it as the metal is really not that strong. I will be going a simpler design for a replacement."
2,Buttons gone,Bought four of these for our new tandem. One was delivered without buttons. One had a broken (split in two) button. The other two cages were ok but I don't have a matched set. After several rides the two cages seem to work ok but some bending was necessary for a good bottle fit. Black glossy finish was acceptable on all four cages.
3,Does not hold 12 oz bottles real well,"This bottle cage is in-expensive and durable but versatile it is NOT. I attempted to ride with a 12 oz bottle (various name brand ones you buy at the store), but it does not grip it, so with a small bump, the bottle falls out from the bottom. I then switched to a larger 20 oz refillable bottle, and now it has a tight fit and has not fallen out yet. And doesn't look like it will fall out ever. I guess you can call this a ""green"" bottle cage cuz it has now forced me to forget using store bought bottled water!"
5,Nice!,"No problems, works well with me bottle and holds it snug. Pretty light and the welds were clean. I'll buy more Planet Bike products!"
3,Decent Cage,"This cage looks nice but isn't as useful as some others. If you try using smaller bottles, the bottles will just slip out through the bottom. Because the platform part where the bottle sits is just too small of an area. Any of the small evian, kirklands, arrowhead water bottles will slip out after a few bumps."
3,Holds a bottle in place,Holds my Stainless steel bottles in place with out problems. The problems come in when I don't have a bottle in it and my left pant leg snags it. I like it though. I ride over bumpy bike paths half of the time and my bottles (27oz kleen kanteen and 27oz h2go bottles) never fall out.
2,Susceptible to bending,"The bottle holder worked well enough. However, the split design makes it susceptible to snagging on clothing and bending out of shape. Once it is bent, it is impossible to bend back without cracking the aluminum. If you only ride your bike wearing shorts, it's probably OK; otherwise, stick to the traditional shape."
5,Very useful and light weight.,This product was easy to install and it held my water bottle very well. This was a good buy for the price.
1,poor customer service and low quality product,"Quality of product is no good, post bent when putting them on then broke off. Customer service with cachebeauty is non-existant! Will never deal with them again or even amazon.com for that matter."
2,too esoteric -- hard to comprehend,This book makes claims about the mind/body interaction (or lack of) and suggests meditation & visualisation exercises to recover our awareness. I am sure there is some value in the exercises suggested at the end of the book -- it's a pity the author has failed to organise the material logically or provide any evidence to backup her theories.
2,Don't Let The Title Fool You...,"The Intuitive Body: Discovering the Wisdom of Conscious Embodiment and AikidoA 2-star rating means ""I don't like it"" when the ""third edition"" of a book (see link above) includesCHANGING THE TITLE so, in my enthusiasm for the subject,I ordered both books only to end up paying for14 identical chapters twice...The third edition does include three new chapters,i.e. 25% more content, andlooks 4-star so far..."
5,"Gorgeous pictures, somewhat dry text","-although the text may just have suffered in the translations. If you want to see the single best collection of K2 photographs I've ever seen, and I have them all, this is the book for you. A bargain at anything less than about $250.00, it's bound and published beautifully (at least my copy was!)"
3,No Closed Caption for the Hearing Impaired,"The Volumes 1 and 2 are colorful, fun, with meaningful stories and my son loves them. The reason I gave this 3 stars is that with all the attention to appreciating differences, episodes on sign language, and so on, I found it ironic that the DVD itself is not closed captioned for the hearing impaired (such as myself). I also like to turn on the closed captions on movies because it helps my son with word recognition and with reading."
5,Good inexpensive shelf,"Purchased two of these to use on a client install. Intended use was to hold audio/video equipment that couldn't be rack-mounted (i.e. stereo receivers/amplifiers, dvd recorders, TV/Monitors, etc). Holes match up perfectly with the rack, and there was no problem supporting the weight of multiple pieces of equipment on each shelf.The depth of the shelves is perfect. Placing a stereo receiver on one shelf, I was able to line up the front of the receiver with the front of the shelf/rack rails, and the back of the shelf extended several inches past the back of the receiver. No worries about anything falling off.These are a good buy, and I'll be buying more of them as I develop needs for them!"
2,A Letdown From his last 3 CDs,"I really like Butch's last 3 CDs. Each one was progressively better in the number of killer songs per CD. I usually like more mellow stuff other than Butch. So why am I dissappointed overall by ""Letters""? The lyrics are fine. Butch's voice is great. The production is solid. But the melodies are not as strong as in Butch's last 3 great CDs. Some parts of the upbeat melodies are bordering on cornball like some 70's TV music show.""Mixtape"" and ""Jane"" are excellent. ""Maybe It's Just Me"" is good. But the rest of the songs just don't measure up to the quality music that is classic Butch.Maybe I need a few more spins, but ""Left Of Self-Centered, ""Ready Sex Go"", and ""Hey Album"" have more quality songs and blow this decent effort away. The people that are giving the ""Letters"" CD 5 stars would probably give a glowing review to Butch farting into a microphone...Geeeez!...Come on Sheeple...Get Real!Can you say, ""Fanatic""?"
5,A Pop Master,"Butch Walker has a gift for pop music. He writes it. He performs it. He edits and produces it, and because he is so rarely multi-talented he has had successes in each arena. You may not know his name, but you know music he's touched. From his high school band Marvelous 3 (""Freak of the Week"") to writing/producing for such bands as SR-71, Lit, Avril Lavigne, American Hi-Fi, and Injected, you probably know a lot of songs that owe much (if not all) their success to Butch's insights and assistance. His solo debut ""Left of Self-Centered"" was catchy but spotty, with no awful songs but few real gems (try ""Far Away from Close"" or ""Take Tomorrow""). However, Butch comes into his own as a solo artist with ""Letters,"" with flowing melodies and gripping pop hooks. While some fans will disparage it for the relatively fewer punk/glam rock songs, listen to it as a roving tour of pop/rock over the last ten years. Personally, I prefer to think of it as a testament to what the genre's been at its best."
5,Dead excited!,"After the first album , Left of Self Centered was released, I was dead excited as the album was a hot stuff! Great songs, lyrics and music!! But Letters was way better for those rockers head. Now, Malaysian don't even know who the hick is Butch Walker and they're missing a great musician!"
4,"Weaker than ""Left of Self-Centered""","I must admit, I was (at first) a little disappointed with this album. As a diehard Marvelous 3/Butch Walker fan, I was initially a bit shocked with the softer touch Butch employees on this CD. I grew to like it (heck, even love it) after a few listenings, but I still feel it's weaker than Left of Self-Centered, Butch's solo debut. It isn't quite as varied--all of the songs definitely have the roughly the same ""feel"" to them. However, it is a very nice album. Mixtape is, in my opinion, Butch's greatest song as a solo artist, and it alone is worth the price of the disc."
3,Orchestra Rehearsal,"Rota, best known for his memorable scores for Federico Fellini, desperately wanted to be known as a ""serious composer"" as well. He was not so self-absorbed however as to think he could escape his notoriety, so first we get 1966's ""La Strada Ballet Suite,"" a pastiche of familiar Fellini themes strung out to 28 minutes. Some of the orchestration is truly breathtaking... although the thematic material is not. Also included here is a Concerto for Strings (1977) with nary a memorable theme, and 7 dances from the film ""The Leopard"" (Visconti, 1963) which are so nakedly derivative of Waldteufel or Strauss that Rota's name seems a surprising addition.One more observation. The recording here, although advertised as 20-bit Super Bit Mapping all-digital (1994), is surprisingly flat and unconvincing. There's a big hole in the center of the soundfield, and the low end is almost totally absent. Though not terrible or anything, for 1994 it sounds oddly like a 1950s Mercury Living Presence."
5,María Antonia Alejandra Vicenta Elpidia Isadora Abad Fernández,"Just when I thought I was out... they pull me back in. I was already hooked on Pedro Infante, then suddenly Saritísima! This all just started as a way to help me with my Spanish comprehension...now it's an addiction. I did gather that Sarita wasn't Mexican, so maybe I'm picking up something about the language."
5,Perfect Power Pop,This is without a doubt one of the best records of the last 25 years. If you like your pop mixed with a little attitude this is the record for you! Something for everyone. You won't be disappointed!!!
4,Great phone for wireless network conflict.,This was my second Panasonic cordless phone. The other was a 2.4 mhz that kept interferring with my home wireless network so purchasing a upgraded Panasonic 5.8 mhz made sense. I have no complaints regarding the phone except after 1 year and 4 months the led screen on the phone stop working.I don't know if anyone else had this problem. The hanset was always care for and to my knowledge was never dropped. It's really tough to use the phone to look for numbers from missed calls or access the menu to make changes. I still recommend this phone and will look for a new handset to see if this corrects the problem.
5,Wonderful and Memorable,"Catherine Bauer's essays make the skin tingle, the mind stretch, and the soul sigh. She uses her wisdom and life experience to give us glimpses into the minds of children, experience the warmth and humor of family members who have passed on, and nudge us to expand our worldview. Her writing is poignant and seamless. My favorite essay was First Class, and With Children. Without telling us what to think, Catherine paints with her words clear pictures of two children she meets while flying. Just six short pages, and these children have left an indelible mark on me. The only flaw to this entire book is the accompanying illustrations which fail to mirror the maturity and depth inherent in each of Catherine's essays."
3,Foot Stool with Support Handle,"The foot stool was not quite as sturdy as I thought it would be. The handle just clicks into the foot stool - no bolts, which makes it a bit unstable. However, it is the correct height needed as well as a decent size platform. The description of the handle could have been better as I might have looked for a different unit if I would have known that it just clicks in like an umbrella. It was very easy to assemble and it was purchased for my elderly sister who is using it to get into her bed. She is happy with it. It shipped in a timely manner and was received in good condition."
4,High absorbency,"I bought these for my 92 year old grandma. She is sleeping more and more in bed, and the caregiver was worried about her being wet. These held a lot of liquid and on that I would rate these a 5. I found them hard to put on her. Maybe it would be easier if she way lying on the bed, but she's not at that point yet... Tranquility has be a very reliable brand."
2,Poor Quality,"I bought these for my adult son, who has cerebral palsy. I was very disappointed with the quality of this brief--about 1/3 of them actually tore during changing (usually, a wing would completely rip off while pulling the diaper snug), rendering them unusable. Moreover, the sizing is really not accurate (order one size larger than you would normally require); and finally, the pull tabs don't really work well and often tear off as well. Do not recommend."
3,Tabs are inconvenient.,"I bought these diapers because I have had success with them in the past as an overnight adult diaper. This particular version has an unusual tab which while meant to make retabbing easier is really inconvenient. The initial tab cannot be repositioned without tearing the plastic on the diaper. The tab on top of that tab can be, but loses its stickiness easily. It is difficult to place the diaper so that it isn't constricting at the legs, so I've often tried to reposition one side or the other as part of the initial diapering process, ruining the diaper in the process because of the supposedly innovative but actually inferior tabs."
4,A great work,I could see this opera in Rio de Janeiro's beatiful Theatro Municipal.Now it is time to purchase and listen to the marvelous and little known music.
5,What a century . . .,"Smashing! That one word does not do justice to Red Sox Century, but it is a beginning. This beautifully wrought volume tells the tragi-comic story of the Boston Red Sox in flowing prose and superb photographs. I don't judge books by their covers...instead I leaf through the index. This detailed and COMPELLING book has an 18 page index. How can you not love this book?!?! Clearly the authors, Johnson and Stout, have a great respect and enduring love not only for the Boston Red Sox, but for all of baseball. WELL DONE!!!"
5,The Trials and Tribulations of Being a Sox Fan,"What a sensational book. I have read Red Sox books in the past, and nothing seemed to capture the essence of the ball club's trials and tribulations than Red Sox Century. This book is as tragic as any classic story and examines 100 years of ""what ifs."" This book leaves no stone unturned and gives fans the ability to learn and love the former players of seasons past. It is the best Red Sox book I have ever read and will give one a deeper appreciation for the organization and it's tragic history. A futher note of excellence for this book are the points the authors make in putting to rest, the ""cursed"" theory and many other false misconceptions of the organization. It is a tremendous book and is a must read for any diehard Red Sox fan. Hell, it's a must read for anyone who wants to read a good tearjerker..."
2,Wanting,"I found this movie to be one that promised what it was not able to provide.While there are some good martial arts people in it the movie, it does not really show case their skills. The stortline was strange and confusing at times,making it more of a labor than plesure to watch it."
2,Well...the cast is pretty good,"Dragon Heat is a difficult movie to review as I feel I was more disapointed in it because I expected more from the cast. Michael Biehn, Maggie q, Sammo Hung, among others are all from a pretty great background. Unfortunately this movie doesn't use them very well. Instead it feels they were in the movie because they owed someone a favor rather than a result of choice. The story is pretty week, the action passable, and the conclusion left me very unsatisfied. While there were some moments worth watching, I can't help but feel that with the level of talent involved, more could have been done. I suggest it as a rental or for those needing to fill the gap in their dragon dynasty collection."
1,Worthless,"This movie is absolutely worthless - the editing will give you epileptic shock due to its amateurish handi-cam manuevers and jump-cuts. The plot is a cliched joke, and the ""action"" consists of a few subpar gun battles and some trashy fighting sequences. Steer clear - Dragon Dynasty should never have picked this one up."
3,Decent Asian Crime Thriller,Good synergy in the film. Decent acting overall especially by Michael Biehn. Seems to run a little long but the climax is worth it. Ending is kinda cheesy but still solid
4,"Not her best, but still worth a look","Much as I hate to give anything by Margaret Atwood fewer than 5 stars, honesty requires me to say that this collection is uneven and sometimes boring. Flashes of brilliance (_Hamlet_ from Gertrude's perpective is the best) still make it worth reading. What the heck - you'll get through it in an afternoon, and it's MUCH better than most of what's out there."
4,Hillariously Satiric...a must read for women and men alike,"Atwoods collection of shot anecdotes ,prose, and takeoffs of traditional narratives creates a delicious layered candy cake, yummy from start to finnish. A light, quick read intended to be thought provoking in either its mildest form or more serious, Good Bones creates a batter of cookie dough complementing her unique sense of style and outlook on our society."
3,"skimps on useful stuff, quotes a lot of speculation","here's the only good I got from it:*schedule your evening meal at least 3 hours before bedtime (same for exercise and caffeinated tea)*eat a large breakfast, moderate lunch, and lighter dinner, or smaller frequent meals*nap between 2 and 4 in the afternoon rather than earlier or later*in warmer weather, open a window a crack to relieve stuffy air*wear socks to bed*try sleeping with a pillow between your knees*try Reiki, acupuncture, acupressure, massage, yoga, and/or meditation*try tryptophan or calcium-rich foods about an hour before bedtime: milk, yogurt, turkey, figs, dates, peanut butter, rice, tuna*try carbohydrates 45 minutes before bedtime: toast, almonds and fruit, cereal, pasta*sedative teas in moderate amounts about 30 minutes before bedtime: chamomile, catnip, or passionflower*avoid msg, nicotine, and caffeine (300 milligrams disrupts REM)"
3,Even Death May Die,"While not the best Lovecraft collection, this one is well worth reading if only to get a serious case of the creeps. (""The Case of Charles Dexter Ward"" will do it by itself.)Centered around dreams, the stories in this collection can be hard to get through at times, but there is usually a tremendous pay off. If this is your first experience with Lovecraft, however, there are better places to begin, as this collection contains some early writings that just aren't up to snuff with is later material.Lovecraft fans will have already read most of these stories, and newcomers may be put off by them, but for those who have experienced one or two tales before, this is a great way to become more familiar with the writer and his worlds."
1,WAY overrated,"so this is 'atmospheric horror?' (excuse my pop reference.) first of all, the cover insults your intelligence. Lovecraft flatters Borges in the highest form, and his language is even worse than Poe's - awkward, verbose, ultimately annoying. the 'atmosphere' is arid, boring. writers (esp. horror and British) need to understand sometimes less is more: flowery & 'understatement' (for most Brits it's unnecessary adverbs and double negatives) only make you sound snobbish. (Lovecraft's pastiche aesthetic & snobbishness actually distract you from his racism.) his 'philosophies' are St. Olafian as well. I had to do a line of coke just to get through the first three pages. the real horror here is any possible amusement.so far I haven't found any horror writer in English worthy of mention. The early Ann Rice, William Blatty and Robert Aickman come close, though."
5,Brilliant,"This is absolutely amazing, ""From Beyond"" got into my head and I was kinda spooked of the air for a while after I read it. I've never been one for being able to truly visualize while reading but Lovecraft is one of the few authors that have been able to hook me in so deep that I can visualize what is going on."
4,"Amazing album, somewhat disappointing reissue","David Crosby's ""If I Could Only Remember My Name"" is an excellent, five star album featuring a number of wonderful guests. It is superb and deserves much more recognition that it gets. You can read the other reviews here or on the page of the original album release to hear more about that. What I'm not happy about is getting only ONE bonus track with the remaster. I've heard over a complete CD of different versions and different songs out there from these sessions. Why not release a 2 CD Legacy Edition with that material? They surely have access to it. This is a disappointing move by the label and I can only assume was done so as to not impede sales of the David Crosby box set ""Voyage"" released at the same time (which is excellent, by the way). When will we see these extra tracks officially released?"
5,The Best,"to come out of Crosby , a forgotten masterpiece that is comming back as a result of Voyage ( Essential Buried Treasures ) , an interesting listen of a very talented musician of my generation ... Love sailing anyway ..."
5,Mesmerizing - still.,"There is good music, great music and then there is timeless music. Everyone who hears this (yep, even the young ones) still thinks it's brand new and hot, says 'Hey, who is that?' and has to run right out to find it. This is timeless, intricate, mesmerizing, exquisite - still. You don't need to know one thing about music to love it. This is for sunsets and sunrises, driving ocean coasts, canyons or mountains, or evenings of good wine and waxing eloquent with friends. A deep and unchanging well, in thirty years I have never tired of this sleeper - Orleans haunts me - nor will you. There isn't a bad track on it. Just as Crosby says, Music is Love - this music. This is music for when you want to remember to feel feelings; to feel real.and ... with what's happened in our world since September, in What Are Their Names, the bard drives home to our hearts once again that 'peace is not an awful lot to ask'."
5,"PURE ART,THOUGHT PROVOKING, ETHEREAL. CROS AT HIS BEST.","FIRST HEARD THIS ALBUM IN HEIDELBERG, GERMANY,1982 IN A SEMESTER ABROAD, AS A SOPHOMORE IN COLLEGE. DIDN'T HAVE ANY MONEY OR A STEREO. THE RECORD SHOPS IN HEIDELBERG WOULD PUT A RECORD FOR SALE ON FOR YOU WITH SOME HEADPHONES UNTIL THE NEXT POTENTIAL BUYER CAME ALONG TO KICK YOU OUT OF YOUR SPACE. TAMALPAIS HIGH AND TRACTION IN THE RAIN WERE UNLIKE ANYTHING I HAD EVER HEARD BEFORE. SINCE THEN I HAVE BOUGHT VIRTUALLY EVERY RECORDING BY THE CROS AND C&N. THEY NEVER HAVE DISAPPOINTED."
2,HDCD Encoded Not?,"Although HDCD encoded is printed on the CD, my CD player indicates the CD is not HDCD encoded. Perhaps Rhino will be reissuing this to correct the error."
4,Re-mastered Crosby,"This CD turned out to be one of my favorites in 2006. With players like Jerry Garcia, Phil Lesh, and most of the Grateful Dead along with Nash, Young, and twenty other maestros from the San Francisco scene of the sixties how can you go wrong. The sound on this album is excellent. They did a great job of re-mastering this work. I just don't understand why I never heard of it before it's re-release."
5,the village voice gave it a D-,"I've always been intrigued by the reviews of this record. especially when it was first released. i loved it and still play it. but the music magazines hated it. robert christgau gave it a D-.anyway, it's a classic.bd"
5,"Great Album, but I've got a question","I purchased the album a few days ago, and I'm totally loving the sound and overall vibe that Cros produces. However, I moved my laptop when updating it to my iPod, and the disc is partially damaged (really dumb of me, but whatever). This version has more stuff with it, but it also costs ridiculously more that the standard, single-unit CD version. Is this version worth the cost, and why? Thanks a lot"
2,Unlistenable Sound Quality - Wonderful Music 5+ stars,"This is one of my favorite albums, but the sound quality of this CD issue is atrocious. The high end is chalk-board harsh. This wonderful inspired album needs wonderful inspired remastering -please!"
5,must-have for anyone interested in late 60's folk-rock music,"A unique combination of musical talent and seat-of-the-pants engineering, this recording captures a time when Crosby was not yet killing himself, and wally heiders in San Francisco was putting together some of the greatest sounding recordings of the time. There was a lot of atonomy and freedom. The looseness and high quality of this is striking."
1,"love the album, but never received it","ordered this in early december from import cds and was sent michael jackson greatest hits instead. sent it back as requested and never heard anything from them and was never credited my money back. i will never do business with import cds again and in fact this has made me think about never ordering anything from anybody over the internet again.steal from me once, bad on me...steal from me twice, will never happen because i refuse to deal with crocks twice.if you deal with import cds and have to return a mis-shipped product, you better pay for tracking and delivery conformation even if it costs more than the product you are returning or else they will just keep your money and play the stupid card."
5,Longevity,"One intriguing aspect of music ( and cinema also ) is how some become old ( meaning the perception ) and some , don't. This collection , originally an LP and now , remastered as a CD, was recorded in 1971, 36 years ago!! and my son ( 27 old ) immediately like it. I'm suspect to say anything because I'm 52 and anyone could say that I am an old nostalgic guy, but its ( or his - Crosby ) atmosphere - chords, instrumental, vocal harmony(using playback to produce complexes vocal chords ),lyrics, are completely contemporary, or better, ageless.God blessing and long life for David Crosby."
5,This Album Joins Three Others...,"...in my All-Time Personal Favourites, the others being: ""Blows Against The Empire"" (by the Jefferson Starship) ""Yr"" (by Steve Tibbetts), and ""Blues For Allah"" (by the Grateful Dead).And it's not surprising, really, since Everyone is on this album. (Who do I mean by ""Everyone?"" Well, as Gary Oldman says in ""The Professional"" - *E-V-E-R-Y-O-N-E*!!!!!) Let's see:David Crosby, Laura Allen, Jack Casady, Ethan Crosby, David Frieberg, Jerry Garcia, Mickey Hart, Paul Kantner, Jorma Kaukonen, Bill Kreutzmann, Phil Lesh, Joni Mitchell, Graham Nash, Gregg Rolie, Michael Shrieve, Grace Slick, and Neil Young.Need I say more? Buy it _NOW_. And never, never loan it out..."
5,You are not a true hippie if you don't have this album,"As said by many who know this work, listening to it is a natural-high in itself; no additives necessary. Not just a simple collaboration between David Crosby and a little help from his friends: Neil Young, Graham Nash, & many of the late60s Haight-Asbury music explosion (Jerry Garcia & Co, Joni Mitchell, Paul Kantner, Grace Slick, etc, etc, etc...), but an album very well done and put together. A masterpiece! A better album than any CSN or even CSNY album (yes, better than Deja Vu)! An album that captures the true spirit - still very alive & fresh at the time - of a decade that just came to an end when it was recorded in late-1970/early-1971. A MUST-GET no matter what genre you are! Yes, and a road-trip across the United States of America cannot be complete without bringing this one along."
3,Badger Sleep Balm,"I don't know, but this one doesn't work for me. I applied it on my temples, above my upper lip, and my throat and nothing happened - I still couldn't sleep. It calms you a lil' bit, but thats about it.When I ordered this, I also ordered (Nelson) Bach Rescue Sleep. Now this one works for me (see my review of it under Bach Rescue Remedy Sleep for further details). It's much better than Badger.I'll check out Valerian Extract (standardized) next time and see the differences between the two."
4,Works like a charm,"I have been an insomniac all my life but don't like the adverse effects of most sleep aids. This was given as a gift to me. I would have never thought that something like this could work! I rub some on my temples and my lips and I slowly relax and fall asleep much more easily. Of course when I am completely wired it won't work as well or as fast, but I was amazed that on some nights that I forgot to use it I tossed and turned for while. Then I put this on and then fell asleep! I don't know how it works but it does. The smell is very discreet and pleasant."
4,Great Product!,The balm works so well you hardly realize you are falling asleep. The smell is soothing and puts your body at ease quickly. I would suggest purchasing this product for anyone who has sleeping problems.
2,"Rifleman, Boxed Set 1","DVD's are defective. Can only view the first 2 episodes before it restarts back to the 1st show. The 2 episodes my wife saw she liked, but would like to see the remaining episodes. These dvd'd were a Christmas present and since she didn't get a chance to view them within 30 days of receipt, we're now stuck with a defective product."
4,Family fare with a bang,"Chuck Connors, Johnny Crawford and the Chuck's rapid-fire long gun are the featured performers of these episodes. I watched this show five days a week when I was a grade-schooler and I'm delighted to find it holds up pretty well. Naturally some episodes are more worthwhile than others (in those days they knocked out thirty episodes or more per year), but overall quality is high for half-hour weekly fare. It's family entertainment that won't bore the not-so-young'uns.Sam Peckinpah created this before moving on to feature films, and he utilized his youth on a California ranch to add realism to the show's atmosphere. Recommended viewing, especially the first couple seasons."
4,It brings back memories,"For the show itself I give 5 stars.For picking episodes (based on guest stars who later became big ?) from the first 5 seasons and putting them out as set one I give 0 stars. So it can only get 4 overall.It seems all the sets follow the same process, and that will make for some interesting continuity jumps from set to set. Young Mark is going to grow up, AND down!A pity, but never mind, I am glad to be able to see rifleman again. I remembered it for two things; the relationship between father and son and of course THAT really nifty rifle!Set one at least, is well worth its purchase price."
5,The book on lattice,"This book is devoted to the subject of lattice packings. It is an outstanding book with all pages interesting. It acts as a reference on the subjects of lattices. What you will find:--Sphere packings, ie the problem of packing spheres in order to maximize density.--The problem of Kissin numbers: maximize the number of adjacent sphere to a given sphere in a lattice--Code, design, and Groups--Error correcting codes--Leech lattice--Integral quadratic forms--Voronoi cell--many, many other subjectsWhat you WON'T find in this book:--The study of Delaunay cells (or holes, L-polytopes) is quite limited--The study of continuous families of lattice is not done, you won't find the Voronoi memoires here--There is just one page on computational aspects of latticeNevertheless this book is excellent"
1,beginning to really hate this thing... aaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhh,"i bought this thing a few weeks ago i thought it was a blast until i threw it in the fire i thought this thing should be tested. it broke almost atomatically. im really ashamed because i thought this thing was durable. but you proved me wrong. all i can say is dont make another one and go back and sit in your corner.love always,a hating customer"
2,Your feet are like in oven when wearing it.,"For this price, this product is with low quality. It is no better than one from Walmart. My feet are like in oven when I wear it. Do not buy this one. I have thrown it away in my storage room."
2,Skating tights,"My daughter uses these tights for figure skating, and they seem thin. She wore a hole in them right away . However, she probably wore them outside of skating too. They're good if you don't plan on skating very much."
5,frankie negron muy buen salsero,"este album de frankie negron esta muy bueno ya que ademas de tener salsa contiene baladas, pop y bachata. el cd esta muy completo y bien trabajado."
3,"Not For a Harcore Salsa Fan, More of a Variety Flavored CD","It has pop, English, and a bachata. This album tried to please too wide of different music fans. I must admit that the salsa songs overall sound better than the ones on the earlier three albums."
2,Ugh!,"I know this is a classic, but, oh my, it was quite a chore to get through. I love other, scholastic works by the esteemed Lord Bacon, but this one was too much for me in it's religiosity, and convoluted story-telling style. It's very short, so I pressed ahead to finish it just so I could say I was committed to do so. Recommended only for the staunchest Bacon fan."
3,a utopia,"This version of the book seems pretty good. It was a clear read and easily understandable. I really only read this book for English, and it has several universal topics that I might right a research paper on."
4,"Speak for yourself, love!","This is the third volume of uncensored crank calls from the Crank Yankers TV show. How is this volume different from the first two volumes? This one is in stereo! This time around, the caller is in the left speaker and the person answering the phone is in the right speaker. Other than that, it's much the same as the other two CDs. Funny crank phone calls by hilarious characters like Special Ed, Hadassah Guberman, Elmer Higgins, Niles Standish, Dick Birchum and Gladys Murphy. If you are a fan of crank phone calls, you should enjoy this."
5,Build you're base,Although most would refer to this as a shoot 'em up game it's really more of a strategy game because you must protect ally tanks until the get to enemy bases so they can assist and fortify you're base with gun buddies(also known as auto fire gun inplacements) and mine fields as well protecting the primary defenses(a goliath tank and 2 or more extra large gun buddies) plus you can take control of you're bases goliath tank and even take it off it's rail!
3,"too simple, but enjoyable nonetheless","The levels were extremly easy...I beat the game in only a few hours. The AI is fairly retarded as well in the story game. But the multiplayer made up for it. It is definitly fun to nuke the other opponents, and the AI reacts better (for some strange reason)in the multiplayer mode. I would say rent the game if you want to play it but replayability is not good enough to actually go out and buy it. Even if just for the multiplayer."
1,one of the worst video games for the n64,"this game is truly bad, with very little entertainment value. bad graphics, bad story, bad replay value. too many good games are out there to spend time with this one."
3,lots of mind rotting violence but fun fun fun.,"you just drive tanks around and blow stuff up.its just like that.the objectives are very decieving.itll say like just go over across the bridge.but the bridge is across town and on every corner is a team of tanks armed with lasers, nukes,mines and all kind of nasty stuff.me and the ol lady beat it in one afternoooooooooooooooooooon.so what to do then?well theres a really great deathmatch section.go there and play your friends.the computer is a bit more powerful than on the regular game.by a bit i mean HELL KICK THE CRAP RIGHT OUT OF YOU.so be careful.whats also fun is to go into a big city on death match like san fran sisco with a buddy and kill all the computer players as a team.then just go around and level the whole city brick by brick.one very cool thing is the nuke.you set it off and well.......youve heard all about it in school.try it out.its awesome!"
3,BattleTanx is a OK game.,"BattleTanx is a really fun and exciting game for a while, but I got bored of it within a month. The single player game is really hard, but the multi-player game is awsome! This game wouldn't be my first choice, but I guess it's worth it."
5,Gorgeous Power Pop,"This is an album for anyone who's been madly in love, gone through a painful breakup, or loved someone from afar. ""Evening Dress"" is a perfect wedding song, while ""Anywhere You Are"" and ""Over And Over Again"" are for those long nights spent thinking about the one that got away. The lead single and opening track ""Top Of The Pops"" is probably the weakest song on the album -- it's a slow-tempo rehashing of the heavy-riffing guitar sound that worked so well on ""A Girl Like You"" -- but the second single ""Too Much Passion"" captures more of the flavor of what's to come. There are a few rocking songs on the album, like the potent blast of ""Tell Me When Did Things Go So Wrong"" and ""Girl In Room 12"", but this album is primarily for lovers of bittersweet jangly power pop like R.E.M., Big Star, and the like."
3,"Alright For Fans, But","The Smithereens are not a great band; it's not that they are bad; they just aren't great. This album is a case in point. `Indigo Blues' is quite infectious and fun, but the rest of the album is formulaic and uninspiring. It seems likely that real fans of the band will enjoy it but casual fans would be better served by a comp."
5,More information than the new editions contain.,"Everyone should have a Physicians' Desk Reference to look up the side effects of the drugs your family or friends might be prescribed. All side effects are expected - but are simply called ""side effects"" if they are not the desired effect you originally wanted. The Seventh Edition of this book has most of the side effects edited out so I recommend this 6th edition. This Pocket Guide is small and inexpensive and I've given many away to ill friends."
1,Just another NASCAR game.,This game is just like all the other car racing games. If you're going to get a racing game get Mario Kart 64. Bottom Line: This game is just plain boring.
4,"Not a classic, but I like this movie","I happen to like all of the main actors in this film: Ally Sheedy, Phoebe Cates, Virginia Madsen and Treet Williams. If you like them, too, perhaps you'll like this movie.Sure, Heart of Dixie has its flaws. I won't argue with the previous reviewer, other than to say that a one-star rating is awfully harsh.This is not a civil rights movie in the way that Ghosts of Mississippi or Mississippi Burning is a civil rights movie. It's more a coming of age story. I enjoyed watching Ally Sheedy's character learn who she is and what she wants to become.Yep, Heart of Dixie is lightweight. Yep, it could have been done better.And still, I like it."
2,ok for a one time viewing i guess,"movie was ok. some of the actresses were way over their heads like when Virginia says 'hold on did i miss sumthing? was i not elected to b miss honeysuckle queen' it was hard not to keep a straight face and Sheedy has never been able to carry off a role stronger than her 'detached' character from Breakfast Club. when she's with Treat it painfully shows her overacting and its distracting with her honey suckle rose sweet alabama tone, ugh! so if u can get from the library and have nothing else to watch then maybe but i guarantee you will b wondering what other movie you could be watching lol"
5,Heart of Dixie,I like any movie that has Treat Williams as part of the cast.I received the movie in the condition mentioned and on a timely fashion.
5,I love this CD.,"This was one of my first examples of classical music. It is a good all around introduction to Beethoven. I still love it. This December when my astronomy club gathered to watch a meteor shower, this was one of the CD's played."
4,Thoughtful look at a complex subject,"Speaking about her own experience as well as that of others with whom she has spoken, Louise Desalvo writes a thoughful book about the complex subject of adultery. This is not a self help book but rather a look at what motivates an adulterous relationship and an exploration of both the good and the harm that such a relationship brings."
4,good,"the film was so good. i was surprised that it was not highly stylized like some films in the same genre. it played more like an independent film with true grit. main character's quiet power and vulnerability was what drew me in. i liked this film a lot and bought it as a gift to a family friend who is the ""ultra male"" type and loves movies; he likes it too."
5,Triad Election,"Wonderful movie. Highly recommend if you like gangster style movies. Not that much blood, very entertaining plot. Liked it better than Election."
1,Homely Heights,"This just may be one of the worst gay themed movies I have ever seen and I make it my practice to see as many as are avialable. The film is a completely disjointed, confusing mess. The only saving grace is the presence of Lea DeLaria. Ms DeLaria makes no false moves...ever. She has a natural talent and the camera loves her. DeLaria has the remarkable ability to make the[...] crap she is given to act here seem like the sweetest perfume.Rent, do not buy this movie, if you have to see it."
5,Why I like Miss Hickory,"From my 7 year-old: ""I like Miss Hickory because when she founded the Ladies Aid Society she taught the hens not only to help themselves but help others too."""
4,"Charming, Old Fashioned Tale","In this day and age, I find it wonderfully calming to read my daughter books I enjoyed as a child. I purchsed Miss Hickory with that in mind, and we are both savoring the tale.Miss Hickory is a country doll, made of a hickory nut head with an apple twig body. Unexpectedly, she finds that her mistress and family have left for the winter, leaving her to fend for herself during the cold dark months in New Hampshire. The sweet simplicity of the story allows my 5 year old's imagination to run wild as she pictures Miss Hickory living in a nest and enjoying the company of the crow and the cat that are her friends.There is a reason this book is still in print after all these years! Treat yourself to some good, old fashioned family reading, and enjoy Miss Hickory!"
4,And starring Jessica Tandy as Miss Hickory,"While continuing my mission to read all the Newbery Medal and Honor books, I came across Miss Hickory. Miss Hickory is our main character and, although I couldn't really find her loveable, like I would Little Georgie,(Rabbit Hill) I love the story just as much. I don't want to give a synopsis to the book, because I fear I will make it sound like one of those cutesy ""animal"" stories. But, truth be told, it is.Hickory's personality isn't as friendly as a main character's should be. Her demeanor reminded me of Miss Daisy in the popular movie Driving Miss Daisy.All in all, this book satisfies the reader, but don't believe the reviewers who said it is for K grade children. The grade level is for a child of grade six, or so says a reading program our school uses. The illustrations were drawn by a Caldecott Honor illustrator and are as memorable as the book itself.R"
2,I was traumatized as a child (Spoiler),"I'm surprised at the number of people who speak of this book as a delightful fantasy. I read it in the fourth grade many years ago, and I still vividly remember how absolutely terrified I was by Miss Hickory's eventual fate. Miss Hickory's head is eaten by a squirrel. I remember the scene as being very vivid. It literally took me years to get over it. As an adult, I mentioned the book to a friend, and she felt exactly the same way. I read it in the mid-1960s, so this shouldn't be attributed to today's kids being softer, overprotected, etc. I would not give this book to a child."
5,looked great on my trailer at the dunes,shipped fast and couldnt beat the price. would buy again and recommend to anyone who wants a flag at a great price.
5,Prompt service,I was sent the wrong flag oops but I wrote a quick email. The responded right away letting me know the right flag was on the way and I still got it before Christmas. Very happy:)
5,loved it,"Great shows! Arrived quickly! Could not have been happier, especially since it was a birthday present. It actually arrived early, so I was impressed."
5,I want to be Pippi when I grow up.,"Pippi is an under appreciated genius. She is sassy and strong and doesnt take any crap....I love her completely. These movies take me back to my childhood, to a simpler time, when a little girls voice didnt have to match her lips moving (one of my favorite things about the original Pippi movies}. A wonderful set for any child, or for the child at heart."
4,Ohh what memories...,"I grew up watching Pippi Longstocking (Pippi Lngstrump as we knew her - I'm from Denmark and watched it with the original soundtrack). It is so amazing how watching these DVD's bring back memories from a time long gone. I have always been fond of children's shows that'll engage your imagination and take you on a journey - and this one truly delivers.The quality of the DVD's are superb, and so much better than when I watched it the first time (early '70s).A must see for children of all ages."
5,pippi longstocking,"This is the greatest collection EVER! If you were ever into pippi as a kid, then this is the collection for you!"
5,Nostalgic Fun!,I was so pleased that this was available on DVD in a boxed set. I grew up looking forward to the yearly airing of Pippi on TV and to own the set is really great! :o)
5,Pippi,"This DVD collection is great. My four year old daughter is hooked. Everyday she ask can she watch Pippi. Her favorite is the one when Pippi goes to rescue her father from the pirates that are trying to get his treasure. This brings back memories of my childhood, when my sister and I would be so excited when it would come on on Saturday and would come on again on Sunday. Fun for the whole family. It's truly worth it. It makes you appreciate the old days, when there wasn't a lot of violence on television."
5,Pippi LS,"these videos are a great collection and show a girl in aggressive and very confident behavior. Many of todays images have princesses unable to control their predicaments. Is a great alternative to many of the Brats, Barbie and Disney princess poducts. My daughters love to watch them."
1,Constant skipping,"Im so disappointed that each of the dvd's has constant skipping through out each movie. Do not buy!!!! now I have to try to deal with all the hassles of returning. Not Happy, very annoyed!!!!!"
1,Bad DVDs,"When inserting disk into DVD player, it rejects te disk. I have a Sony DVD player and I know it the defected pippi disk. And all four disk are rejected by the DVD player"
2,Disappointed-Very Bad Dubbing,"Bad dubbing...I didn't recall this when I had seen it when I was a kid...also, I think DVD was damagaed because the while playing it kept getting ""stuck""...over all, very disappointed!!"
2,Pippi Langstrumpf,I am very disappointed everything is off. The songs are not the original and so forth... I would not get the English version at all if I knew that the translation is so bad!!!!!!This was for the below product.The Pippi Longstocking Collection (Pippi Longstocking / Pippi Goes on Board / Pippi in the South Seas / Pippi on the Run)
2,Pippi,"I remember loving these films as a child, but watching them as an adult, I felt they moved very slowly."
1,Do not read it,"I actually felt cheated when I read this book. It does not seem to be a Anne Rice' book, anything of her genius appears to be reflected in this book. I do not know what happened when she wrote it, but it seems rather a cheap horror movie from the 40's years than one of her wonderful master pieces."
5,A very valuable reference/practice manual,"I have trained with several Dharma teachers these past 52 years. I have also practiced extensively with Tenzin Wangyal and the first thing I noticed was he has an excellent command of English. Second, he knows how to train westerners. But the most important is ""Does his training work?"" ""Does it produce results?""I would say to both of these ""YES!!!"" His books are clearly written, and easily applied. This book contains materials I have taught from in prisons, in formal classes and the practices in this book I have seen change lives including my own."
4,Easy to Read Overview,"I bought this book to learn about this subject, and found the material easy to learn. It gives a good overview and good solid techniques. The only possibility of improvement could have been that it could have delved deeper into shamanic practices. Still it is an excellent book and well worth reading."
5,The Reputation Lives ON!!!!,I have to say this is one of my favorite albums. If your an indie kid inside you will love this album. This is exactly where Sarge left off. Elizabeth Elmore has been rocking for more than a decade and keeps going strong with The Reputaion. Highlights of this album I have to say is Misery by Design. At this moment the band is unsigned. Lookout Records dropped allot of their bands of the lable and are now only going to be putting out re-issues. Check them out on myspace.com..
3,What Is This?,"after receiving the package i was excited to play the new game i just bought. i open up the mail and insides is a green case??? opening up it is the game i had ordered. the disc was in decent condition and the book was in good condition as well. i just wish i could have had the proper case to a game i played when i was little. might buy from again, pending on the service.-Ven Corbin"
5,Very satisfied!,The game was exactly what I was looking for & was shipped faster than I had expected. It worked great & was sold for a great price! I would definitely buy from this seller again.
4,Finally Found It,Resident Evil has long been my favorite rpg series. I had searched all over for a copy of this game and finally found it here at bargain price and excellent quality.
3,Good game,"This was the second RE game that I played, and though good, it did not live up to RE 2......In fun factor. But I did enjoy the puzzles and challenge of it.Here are my opinions of the whole thing:Graphics:*** (Great for an old game, but they should have made them better for the new version.)Sound:** (The sound effects are great, but in the dual shock version [the one I have] the music is different and not as good, plus the dialogue [is bad])Control:**** {Great control, but the walking is kind of hard to get used to)Fun:***1/2 (Overall a good game, just not great.)"
3,Frustrating but Fun Most of the time,"THIS GAME IS FRIGGIN' FRUSTATING BUT FUN MOST OF THE TIME. IT'SPUZZLES ARE VERY CLEVER WHICH OFFERS CHALLENGE.THE THINGS I HATEARE:1.U CANT SKIP THE CUT-SCENES2.INSANLEY FRUSTRATING3.NOT ALL OF THE GRAPHICS ARE GOOD.(EXCEPT 4 THE BACKROUNDS)4.CRAPPY CAMERA ANGLES5.NOT AS GOOD AS RE4 OR RE26.DIFFICULT CONTROLS7.CLUNKY COMBATSO PEOPLE, THIS MIGHT BE WORTH A RENTAL. ITS SCARY BUT ITS NOT AS GOOD AS SILENT HILL,RESIDENT EVIL 2OR4.IF YOU HAVE A GCUBE,GET RESIDENT EVIL 4 OR THE NEW ORIGINALRESIDENT EVIL EVEN RESIDENT EVIL 2 IF YOU HAVE A PSX.OR JUST GET THE PLAIN ORIGINAL RESIDENT EVIL ON YOUR PSX.THIS GAME IS A LITTLE BELOW AVERAGE.AND IF YOU'RE LOOKING 4 AGAME THAT WILL MAKE U CRAP YOUR PANTS JUST GET RE4.WAY MORE WORTH YOUR TIME."
5,ahh the one that started it all,"the one that started it all i have it and you should to i will in detail say the pros and cons of the game.the pros are great story, great puzzles, the suspense is great as well as the monsters that are in it over all it draws you in the world of the resident evil.the cons to much back and forth in the game, bazooka wont blow open doors, the other issue is if played on the ps2 you have to get used to the original controls again im used to ps2 games now guess im spoiled lol where you use the analog sticks to move and look around.over all great game turn out the lights put it in and put yourself in the game and have fun."
3,"Cool but not the ""Cut""","It was very fun to play the game with the new camera angles but its not the true Directer's Cut it was meant to be (thus the low score). If you can get your hands on the Japanese game, do so."
3,fun but gets boring,This is a good and fun game but after you beat it 2 or 3 times you lose all interest.
5,resident evil is the bomb!,"hi everyone. i just wanna say that if you haven't tried resident evil director's cut you should. even though it's really really scary u should try it. it's filled with mind crazing puzzles that want to make you explode if you can't figure them out. so i believe that everyone should try the game even though u should be 17, i'm not but i still love it. i was freaked the first time i played the game but now i like it and it's not that scary. the dogs are freaky at first and their are tonz of them, also their are tonz of zombies. even though sometimes i get stuck and can't do anything else i find another thing by keep going into different rooms, therefore i think that everyone should try resident evil director's cut."
3,Resident Evil,"The game i recieved was resident evil (not the directors cut, which i ordered) being that im not a picky person especially since im overseas and it takes awhile to get mail, i was able to look past it, the sound quality isnt average, it skips and cuts out voice conversations in cut scenes but still the game is fun."
4,WARNING,Resident evil directors cut is a great game dont get me wrong but the picture is incorrect. The product being sold is the DUEL SHOCK VERSION. Though the game is still great the sound track has been changed and the new sound track [is bad]. The ending was also taken away to make it [bad] that much more. So just keep in mind that this isn't the origenal version of resident evil DC
3,Better to play RE1 before RE2,"I bought RE2 before RE1DC, and not suprisingly, RE1 was a bit disappointing. It is a great game and I enjoy playing it, but once one is accustomed to playing RE2, RE1 seems a little ""lame"". Kind of like driving a Lexus around for a while, then changing to a Corrolla. Still a nice car, but not quite the same.Don't get me wrong, I HIGHLY recommend the game, but if you're just getting into the RE series, buy and play them in order."
3,O.K.,"The second release of the original horror game, you are put back in control of Chris Redfield or Jill Valentine, which are stuck in a mansion full of man eating monsters. Is this really supposed to be a directors cut? Well it ain't, the extra blood and gore is nowhere to be found. Not much has changed, except the music. What was once a spine tiggling beats are now things that make the game less scarier. Dual Shock? Not really a big deal. Sure there are tremors, but it doesn't really spice up the game. Directors Cut is still good, but only worth getting if you don't already own the original. R.E. veterans, stick to a rental."
4,The first and best RE in the whole series,I first bought bought resident evil online and played it for the first time ever. It could get old after playing it through both scenarios 2 times each but playing through it the first time is intense for either charater. You dont carry many weapons though and there is not much ammo in the whole game to collect I always run out of ammo before the end. And i cannot figure out how to use the poison rounds the gameplay is fun but the voiceovers dont match really what a character is saying. My favorite charater is Jill because she carries more weapons than Chris. I like all the resident evil games for different reasons i will list them.Resident evil*Best music out of them all*gameplay is easy*whole cast of charatersResident evil 2*Music stinks*gameplay is easy*a small cast of charaters*more weaponsResident evil 3*Hardly any music at all*Gameplay the same as the other two*about 4 main charaters*alot more weapons than one and two*Better zombies and more creatures
4,The best one in the series...,"Sadly... the subject is true. This is the only Resident Evil worth ANYONE'S time. It's really challenging, and long enough to satisfy the gamers that crave those 11-hour RPGs. Other good games to check out are Parasite Eve or Silent Hill."
2,the original and gamcube versions are much better!,First off this game takes off some of the best bosses and many of the good areas. The original and gamecube versions are much much better. Get them instead of this one or if your a collecter get this one but dont bother playing it inless you dont like the other longer versions. And that dead guy you find at the biggining wont have that tape you would find on the other games which is a big downfall well not really but still. it can still be quite scary but not as and since its the playstation version the graphics arn't as good as the gamecube(im sad to say this seeing as I prefer the playstation to the gamecube). Irt just stinks
2,CASH COW,"DON'T BUY THIS! APART FROM NEW CAMERA ANGLES AND NEW CLOTHES AND EXTRA BAD GUYS THIS IS UTTERLY POINTLESS. NOT QUITE AS BAD AS GUN SURVIVOR, THOUGH."
1,A horrible film that pokes fun at TV reality shows,"Treat Williams has made some bad films, and ""Gale Force"" is another stinker to add to his filmography. This direct-to-video garbage stars Williams as a LAPD detective who is asked to sign up for a new TV reality show, ""Treasure Hunt"", after he is suspended from the police force. The film's director (supposedly it's Jay Andrews, not Jim Wynorski) decided to steal some footage and action sequences from other films, such as ""Last Action Hero"" and ""Die Hard"". I wonder how the makers of ""Last Action Hero"" feel about having its car chase sequence being digitally inserted into this film! Anyway, avoid this one at all costs, and pray that Treat Williams' new TV series will be better than this [one]."
3,Great game,"Although it hasn't aged well Jet moto still is fun and difficult. It's by the same people who made the twisted metal series so it shares some music.One of the complaints is the graphics, they are pretty bad, the difficulty is also insane on some tracks where the AI is always faster then you. The game also runs slow compared 2 and 3. It's a good game that really hasn't stayed the test of time, but for a nostalgia trip, it's worth the little cash."
4,All in one,"Despite its ""trendy"" title -- very postmodern, combining Salman Rushdie with George Lucas and Star Wars -- and the multiple authorship, this survey is a very readable, clearly articulated consideration of the central problems and issues in post-colonial scholarship. The authors write seamlessly as one, not as a committee, though it is clear that they combine complementary areas of expertise. The consideration of feminist scholarship was perhaps the most disappointing: unlike the other analyses, it seemed desultory. The book is also to be commended for being not merely a conscientious account of post-colonial research, but also a thoughtful and fair-minded critique as well."
2,just-- blah,"I thought a couple of neat ideas were in this book, but lots were not so intresting. Like the disco ball was fun,but the putting of jewels on every single thing is something that i was not interested in. i mean who wants rhinstones on their calculator?"
3,This Definitely Isn't Ruined,"You're Gonna Ruin Everything is the second album to be released by Portland emo-rockers The Maroons. For a quick reference point, members of this band have played in/with The Jicks, Heatmiser, Elliot Smith, The Fastbacks and many more, and whilst there is definitely traces of the influence some of these bands (particularly Elliot Smith), The Maroons tend to sound more like the present crop of indie up and comers, particularly Death Cab For Cutie. The tunes on this album are all catchy, differing in pace between empathetic ballads and melodic powerpop tunes. The instrumentation itself is softly beautiful, and is complimented by frontman John Moen's gorgeous falsetto vocals. Picks of the crop include 'Lonely Summer', 'Swimmers' and 'Ruin Everything'. Whilst it is unfair to judge The Maroons based on their credentials, they have come up with a fine album that will hopefully be able to carve the band an identity independent of their illustrious pasts."
3,It's alright,"My Sidekick is really scratched on the silver parts. The cover makes it look better however, the piece that fits around the screen has a section that's thinner than the rest so, the silver shows through a little (I bought a black cover)so, I exchanged it for another. The new one they sent was worse so, I just kept the old....don't know if it was the color I chose but I don't think I would but it again."
1,Just doesn't hold up...,"I bought this in 2010 and it was in the trash around the same time in 2011. While it looked like it would hold up, it suffered from the same things most covers do. Stains, dry rot, cracking, leaks, holes. It was able to make it through one Indiana winter and to a rainy spring, but that was it. At around $60 that is just not good enough. I expected it to make it at least 2 years hopefully more. I am seriously thinking about just using a standard tarp...you can pick them up for next to nothing and they seem to last forever. In the end...buy something else."
2,Not that great of quality..,"Bought several of these covers and they worked great at first..then months later they started warping, mildewing and the plastic was breaking/ tearing.. Not the greatest covers by any means.."
1,d ont buy,The cover has been over my patio set when it rain and there is always water coming through it.If there is an amount of water over a stitches you can be sure that it will be damp under and its only 2 month old.NOT WATERPROOF OR WEATHERPROOF.
4,Generac 04582,I have had this generator for one year now. I bought it after hurricane Ivan. I used it for 4 days after hurrican Dennis and it never missed a lick. I kicked off 8 tons of ac with it (staggered the starts) and basically it ran my whole house with the stove and hot water heaters turned off.It does burn a lot of fuel and it is loud. I wired through the 50 amp outlet.RM
1,This Generator is JUNK,"This Guardian Generator Model # 04582 is JUNK.DO NOT BUY.I have had this generator for 4 months and it hasnot run right yet. Hunts badly from 55 to 65 cycles.Now, I can't get it to start.Customer Service is horrible. Can't get a phone numberto talk to anyone at Guardian.The Authorized Dealer in my area does not know what wrongwith the generator and will not give me a number so I can send it back."
3,"NOT a 22,500 watt generator!","The model 04582 is a portable generator which puts out a steady 15,000 watts depending on variable conditions such as heat, the octane of the gasoline it uses, and the condition it is in.It will peak at surges of up to 22,500 watts for a few seconds only such as during 5 ton AC start ups. If you think you are buying a 22,500 watt generator you will be sadly mistaken. Northern Tools list their generators this way in order to make them appear to be a good deal price wise. [...]I use this generator in my business for power tools in new construction and I wouldn't think of installing it in my home for a stand by power source. Instead, look at the home stand by models built for that purpose and which come with the automatic transfer switch for not a lot more money than this vendor is asking for this portable.By the way; this machine will guzzle 32 gallons of gas at close to full load in 24 hours."
1,Engine Hunts up and down,The engine hunts up and down every few seconds.So the light get bright and then dimThe engine cycles between 58 and 62 cycles per secondThe Authorize Service dealer said this can't be fixWorks good on lights but on electronic equip this is bad.
4,Good collection,"Liked 2nd volume better, but worth it, a good smathering of old and new tales for around campfire. buy both"
1,Nothing special,"There are no logos on the case (like A&E;, History Channel, etc) so no one claims to have produced it. The narrator wasn't identified. Running time appears to have been overstated. Low res, low contrast footage that has been seen before.A small note on the back of the case: ""Portions of this DVD have previously been released as BATTLELINE"".A waste of money, IMO - I was reluctant to write this review, because I'd be admitting I was dumb enough to buy it (and another one from the same series). But I feel I need to warn others - maybe they can avoid making the same mistake."
2,Hungry for scraps?,"TAL make pretty, sometimes predicable music that certainly has its introspective moments though rarely warrants close examination. Whatever moderate, ever so brief success they achieve here really feels offset by an awkward splitting with the clunky beat driven and experimentally musty ambiance of an irrelevant On Air Library."
2,Not as good as I had hoped,"So far, my 1 year old hasn't been able to sit throught this one. The Sesame Street part is fine. She likes seeing Big Bird talk about songs with all of his friends, but the real weakness of the DVD is when the film of the animals comes on(which is why I bought this in the first place, because my daughter loves seeing animals). The first segment is of a dog herding cattle, except the film is so old and grainy it reminded me of the old Lorne Greene animal documentaries he used to narrate. My daughter got bored and crawled away. So I skipped to the next song which wasn't as bad, so she sat and watched it happily. Then the third song came up, and again the film looked 30 years old, and off she went. What's the point in watching a DVD if you half to skip through half of it? I was very disappointed with this Sesame Street effort."
1,arrived cracked and wouldn't play,"My son likes the movie; we had owned it before but lost it so I ordered a new one. The vendor sent it in a timely fashion, but it arrived cracked and wouldn't play. I tried to return it but somehow AMAZON didn't have it listed as something I purchased until after the 30 day return policy had expired. Gessh! When the system works, I love it, but when there's a breakdown; it's frustrating."
4,Great Video -- especially the live footage,"Besides the great songs on this video, the segments with real animals have been fantastic at helping our 2 yr old identify animals. It also provides a jumping off point to talk about animal sounds as well. Bascially our 2 year old has responded with rapt attention and interest to all of the video segments and is pointing out elements to us. ""Pig"", ""Bee"", ""Starfish""!In the ""I Love Being a Pig"" song, substitue ""Kid"" for ""Pig"" and parents can enjoy the song as much as the kids ;->"
4,"sing, hoot & howl with the sesame street animals",my little 22 month old grandson just loves the DVD over and above his baby einstein DVD's. I have seen an increase in his vocabulary. he has even learned to sing the song.
3,Worth it for a few gems,"I bought this DVD for ""I'm a Hard-Working Dog"", ""I Love Being a Pig"", and ""Which Comes First (The Chicken or The Egg)"", along with the grainy '70's video that I remember so fondly from childhood. As with the other Sesame Street videos, I wish they would just let those old clips stand on their own instead of feeling the need to pad them with some contrived Muppet scenario (this time it is a meeting of the ""Sing, Hoot and Howl club"". However, my 4 1/2 year old enjoys the DVD as a whole anyway."
5,This is my toddler's favorite video,"My son has been watching this video since he was around 6 months old, and still loves it (he's now 15 months old). He watches it almost every day, and never seems to get tired of it. As soon as we put it in, and Old MacDonald comes on, he starts bouncing up and down and making excited noises. The songs are very catchy, the length is perfect (30 minutes, just enough time to make dinner), and it's educational. My son is learning all about the different sounds that animals make. Somehow, our tape got ruined, so we are buying a new one. We can't live without it!"
4,Great dvd - lots of muppet animals - fun songs,"My 4 1/2 month old son loves this dvd, and it's pretty entertaining for parents too. Great, fun songs and lots of silly muppet animals. My only complaint is that the dvd has an ""ad"" for sesame street at the beginning which you cannot skip or fast forward over, so you have to watch it every single time and wait for it to finish before you can even set the rest of the dvd to play. Also, the song/chapter selection only shows you the first half of the dvd unless you fast forward to the middle and then look at it again. Overall, though, a very nice dvd and I recommend it!"
4,Great video...,"Especially if you love 'Gladys The Cow' (one of my favourite muppets). She was hilarious on this video. The problem was that there weren't enough Muppet songs. there was some, but the others just showed real animals. they could have shown some more Gladys songs or maybe even some songs Kermit The Frog or that Animal Orchestra featuring Placido Flamingo and Seiji Ozawa"
2,Does not work with Windows XP,"I bought this item, only to find out that I had to go to a third party website and purchase a driver for an additional $18.95. The program is filled with bugs, and about 50% of the time will not load at all. I am only able to access about 25% of the vocabulary words because of numerous bugs in the program.Overall, this language lesson program has caused much more frustration than it is worth."
3,Not really worth it,"A good intro for those interested in learning a few phrases from several languages, but definitly not for those wanting to concentrate on one or two. Only teaches you about 50 words per language. Plus, I think some of those are wrong. No grammar lessons, no writing lessons. Strictly vocabulary."
1,Why learn 102 languages,"I purchased this product to learn some Slovak,the language of my parents.There were a total of 44 words or phrasess such as hello, yes, milk, where is the bank,etc. If you are looking for a few words only this will do. However if you are looking to learn enough to speak the language it might be better to purchase something else. What is given is done well. The speakers are usually easy to understand.The small quizzes are helpful to test your memory. The graphics are good."
2,JUST the Basics!,"She's not kidding! Just the Basics is what this book covers. If you're at ground ZERO in computer familiarization this book will be useful. If you want serious, in depth understanding about FTP, this book is not much help! The first 20 pages are on FTP. The remaining 75 are about e-mail. Very good for real Beginners."
4,Birds of East Africa Princeton Field Guide,At Last a concise well illustrated easy to manage field guide for bird watchers travelling to East Africa. Previous reviews although excellent are to heavy and bulky for international travellers with serious weight limitations on the luggage they are allowed.The illustations are excellent and there is adequate factual information and good maps to accompany them.
3,Reasonably good field companion,"Good illustrations and maps. Would have really appreciated a portrait index for quick look-up of unknowns, more detail of abundance and flocking habits. A few more flight profiles would be helpful as well, but the book is not bad in this respect."
4,a good start - but a thorough review is in order,"I used this field guide during my recent trip to Kenya and Uganda. Although it is by all means an excellent fieldguide I do have some remarks. A number of the plates contained errors, suggesting the artists didn't see these birds in the field. I realise it is virtually impossible for artists to see all species featured in a book such as this in the field, so that a lot of plates are drawn from skins. It is important however to use skins from the region itself, this may make a lot of difference. We came to the conclusion that for a number of species skins from west Africa were used. Especially the greenbuls had some misleading plates. For a number of species the Kenyan Zimmerman-book is probably better, although those plates lack in other respects.In addition a number of the maps were incorrect, especially for Uganda.Still, if you go to the region for birding, make sure to get this book, because it is definitely the best field guide around."
5,The perfect field guide!,"This book really sets a very high standard and we can only hope other parts of the world's tropics will get similar guides in due time. The plates are just about as superb as one could possibly wish for. When you compare this book with the new field guides that have recently come out for South America, it seems like there are two worlds! Just compare the flamingos, the osprey, or the parrots with the pictures you find in ""The Field Guide to the Birds of Peru"" and you know what I mean! There is also an excellent lay-out, with helpful concise text and useful range maps all neatly placed together. And the book is still amazingly compact."
5,"Awesome book, OLD edition!","As another reviewer mentioned, there's a problem with the editions Amazon is selling. The first edition of this book was published in 2002. As of 5/5/2010 the ISBN number on this page is for the 2006 edition, although I was sent the 2002 edition. Hopefully after my bringing it to their attention they will correct the error (if you look in the information about the publication it says it was published in 2002, so if that's changed they will likely have corrected the problem)."
5,Wonderful!,"Jackson 5, Marvin Gaye, The Supremes...Best of Motown on DVD can only offer a wonderful time delenate TV. Highly recommended, a classic indispensable."
5,A Blast From the Past,"I viewed this video and allowed my mind and emotions to travel back through the years to enjoy the groups, music and times of yesterday. I grew up with the Motown sound and although it's been many years, since the groups were established, the video will return you to a more entertaining, casual, fun time.Whether young or old you will enjoy spending this time with Motown and I am so grateful to Ed Sullivan who gave our music a chance to be heard nationwide."
1,"Good game but not ""King of the Ring""","This game has good graphics. If you are looking for a brawling, one punch knock out type of game, this is the one. But if you want a realistic boxing game try King of the Ring. It has most of the greatest boxers of the past 50 yrs; Ali, Sugar Ray Leonard, Holyfield, even ButterBean. This is the game to play when you want a real boxing experience. In the career mode you sculpt the boxer into the fighter you want; fast, strong, or both."
1,my review,"the Contender is an ok game, but I wouldn't recomend it. If you want a boxing game, get Knockout Kings. The Contender is more like a fighting game than boxing game. I have played both games and Knockout Kings blows out the Contender. Knockout Kings actually has real boxers in 3 weight classes, plus you can create your own boxer and bring him up to the top."
3,Ehhhhhh good.....,It's a good boxing game. I mean there aren't any real fighters or venus. But it's still a good game i mean not that bad.P.S. This isn't what you think of a boxing game it's more like a fighter its kinda realistic
3,Works - but does not last,Not much more to say other then this product does what it says.The problem is that it doesn't do it very long.Mine lasted just about a year before I ended up getting hard case for it.Save your money and get the hard case for real protection.
4,"bluegrass ""picks""","My dad would love this album, he likes classic chet atkins, roy clark, etc. Just loves old school guitar/fiddle picks--I am sure he will enjoy this instrumental version of my favorite group!! Can't wait to see his response. Would have given 5 stars if not an instrumental version."
5,One of my favorite records,"I LOVE this record. Far and away his best, with Matthew Sweet's wonderful vocals in the background. The only song I don't like was the ""hit"" single off the album -""She's a Girl and I'm a Man"". It's a shame this CD didn't get more attention."
5,The sample tracks do no justice to this outstanding disc!,"I'm a big Lloyd fan and this disc is easily his best, but the very best songs are in the second half of the disc, which at the time I'm writing this are not available to sample on this webpage. Everyone I know who's ever heard this disc either likes it or loves it, so I recommend taking a chance."
5,best of best,"definitely one of the best album made in 90s. mellow tunes and sophicated song writing and arrangement. a real jewel, and a must have.."
3,Nothing really weird here!,"This is a sophisticated sound that blends the 70s with a distinctive 90s tonality. Half Of Everything and Tell Your Sister have prominent piano with an almost European mood, while To The Lions sparkles with simmering rebellion whilst She's A Girl And I'm A Man is a real cry from the heart. Some tracks, like Weeping Wine, tend to border on the mundane. There's a few mediocre tricks on Don't Get Weird On Me Babe, but overall it's a worthy album with enough melodic meat."
4,"Smart, Melodic Rock 'n Roll for Grown-ups","""Don't Get Weird On Me Babe"" is the second solo album by Lloyd Cole after he broke up the Commotions, his '80's Brit-rock band. Half the record is guitar and drum numbers, the other half orchestral-backed numbers. No smarm at all, in spite of the violins. His lyrics are intelligent on the subjects of relationships gone wrong, sometimes funny, never short on heart. Although I don't know many people who own this record, all that do count it among their favorites."
4,"Orcus, nice to meet you.","Well, first of all if you want anything that's not a dungeon full of tricks, traps and monsters stop reading and search anywhere else, but, if you are a diehard dungeoncrawler, you have found what you deserve, a full 26 level dungeon with fun for all. As Dungeon Master you can play some monsters and traps that will for sure be the nightmare of your PC's for years, and as PC you will found enough adventure, treasure, and , of course, XP to fill and entire sesion of adventure-telling at GENCON.One last thing, if you have played Undermountain and you are expecting something like that, please, forget about surviving, this time every hall have a description."
5,High Adventure Found,"""first edition feel"" is easily defined by the Rappan athuk seris. If your Dungeons and dragons players like classic dungeon crawls loaded with riddles, traps and unbelievable foes!I highly recomend this series as being a moden cult classic in the making.No dungeon published will top this one for years to come."
3,"Small, fits 4/4 violin.","Works great on violin, but a bit small for my 15.5"" viola. Not complaining much though. Will look for bigger size."
5,Very good for the price,This mute makes the sound very quiet and now I can practice at home without disturbing anyone! It's easy to put on and take off and stores away in my case very easily. It was a little tight at first on my 16 inch viola but it stretched out a bit and it fits perfectly now. I love this product and I'm very pleased with the quality of it.
5,These Guys Need To Reunite NOW!,"This album(and the even better follow-up)got all but drowned out in the din of the early nineties grunge mania!It seems like radio( and quite possibly their record company)never gave these guys a chance,although""Three Strange Days"" from this album was a pretty big hit in the SF bay area at the time(if not anywhere else!)I never even knew about the follow up album ""Human Cannonball"" until months after it's release,and I didn't find out about their breakup(and the lead singer's excellent solo album)until more than a YEAR after the fact!Stong songwritting,great vocals,& killer guitar work from one of the most underated melodic players of all time,Michael Ward,this is absolutley not only the most crinimaly ignored band of the 90's,but one of THE most crinimaly ignored bands of all time!I'm waiting & hoping for a reunion!"
5,majik!!,"it amazes me constantly how some of the best sounds that are offered to the music buying public seem to slip into a vacuum. School of fish should have been up there with the 'Stones, the lyrics are ace and the guitar breathes and flows with the lyrics to fill in the flat spots between the words. They remind me of a much calmer Gary Moore on his ""Wild Frontier"" cd. Its a real pity they didn't get the sucess with this album they deserved."
1,STARLESS,"I heard that song recently ""Three Strange Days""...and I recalled how much I detested it when it came out. Overt pandering to tyros in altered states. Now I can't get it out of my head, and may require a lobotomy. There was a lot of interesting stuff that came out in '91; but this wasn't part of that canon. Nice try School of Fish. Have fun playing the CYO circuit."
2,In the list of the top 100 WORST CDs ever?,"This is the worst CD I own from the year 2003. I'm glad I got this as a gift cause it definately wasn't worth my money. I saw them live at pittsburgh with thursday and they were rwally awesome, but this CD is so repetative and boring. The music is amazing and the lyrics aren't too bad, but the vocals are horrible. He sounds like system of a down on acid."
1,"This is a Joke, right?","DEATH BY STEREO were recently in concert with Soulfly (AUSTIN, TX) and some local bands. They were totally manic onstage, looking like 5 guys on too much caffine -- the show was so bad that at the end, people seemed to be cheering BECAUSE it was over. The vocalist was so obese that most people thought a clown suit would have been more appropriate than the tight fitting outfit he had on. The bassist was appropriately dressed in black -- the band died in concert. Everyone else seemed to be out of place as well.The CD reveals what's wrong: competent instrumental playing, but no real songs. The vocalist sounds like he has a sore throat, and most of it sounds like it was hastily written for a high-school 'battle of the bands'.Since this is farce, once is enough. Repetition only wears out the welcome and drain the humor from the farce."
2,They can play their instruments but thats about it,"Wow does this band suck. I do admit that they have a song or two in the mix that I enjoy MUSICALLY. Lyrically they're totally awful. The lyrics are vague, so vague that they're practically meaningless. For example, here's a sample from ""Wasted Words"":""Open up your eyesCan't you see the liesReligion, the hatredthe money, they're makingTake your life backThen you'll fight backWhen you see the wrongThen you'll be the song.""How insightful and inspiring! Thanks Death By Stereo, I feel a lot smarter now.Their older stuff is better, even the lyrics.PS: Here's a clue that this album really, really sucks: There are a grand total of SEVENTY-FIVE copies of this album in the ""used & new"" department."
2,one of the most over rated bands,"In life there are many things people dont like to admit. For instance, the fact that root beer tastes like toothpaste. Not that that is a bad thing. But I digress. People also do not want to admit that if suicidal tendencies and system of a down had a child with downs syndrome, and he were to start a band, it would sound a lot like death by stereo."
2,What....just happend here??,"Seriously, could Death By Stereo put out a more bland, lackluster effort? Sure in their previous CDs they were a little repetitive too, but the difference is...the songs were actually GOOD. I think theres like a 20 second breakdown in These Are A Few Of My Favorite Things that is worthwhile, but it just blew my mind how boring these guys could actually be. I always had a Respect for DBS, but with this CD it just killed it. The intensity of this CD compared to other DBS CDs also went down the tube, and it sounds like Ephram and company just gave up. Other people are going to rate this much higher just because its death by stereo, but if you judge music by sound rather than band reputation you'll be just as upset with this CD as I am. If your into meaningless rehash, this CD is for you."
5,VIVIsectVI es imprescindible,"Me tomo 4 años entender este disco. Yo habia escuchado varias cosas de Skinny Puppy, pero particularmente a este disco lo rechazaba por su crudeza. Justamente eso me atrajo posteriormente, y descubrí sobre esas texturas la furia y la decepción del ser humano. Creo que cada disco de Skinny Puppy se destaca por algo, pero este en particular abrió en mi nuevos horizontes en la música."
5,junk,"here's how i'd put it: the first time you hear Skinny Puppy, it sounds like the absolute worst trash ever produced. the second time, you're intrigued. the third time, you're hooked. and then you're addicted.that's how it worked for me... VIVIsectVI introduced me to the good ol' days of industrial (those days ending in 1995, when Goettel died), when it was cool to wear fishnets and black nailpolish, and when people would wonder just what the hell the NIN logo meant (mind you, some still do)...Harsh Stone White is one of the best industrial songs i ever heard. voilà."
3,A turning point in the Puppy sound.,"This is a good Cd, but there are many better Puppy Cds. The first four songs are great, then they get worse and worse. But, this Cd does show the change in the Skinny Puppy sound, making more angry music. If you're looking for true Puppy anger, get Too Dark Park, if you're looking for the best Puppy Cd, get Remission. Brap On."
1,Could this be the worst album I ever bought?,"Let me illustrate how bad this album is. In 1991 after being in the Gulf War I was sent to Northern Iraq through Turkey to take part in Kurdish Relief. I had a few tapes with me [Neil Young, Pistols, etc] as did a few others. During a break, where I went back to the Air Base in Turkey/ I was able to buy a few tapes at the PX.Among the tapes were two of the worst pieces of music I've ever had the agony to hear. One was Primus ""Sailing the Seas of Cheese"" and the other was this sad excuse for music. I couldn't give this away to the other soldiers even in a mountainous area [northern Iraq] where we had little entertainment except shortwave radio, some tapes and books. No one, I mean no one wanted these tapes.I ended up throwing Skinny Puppy ""Vivisect Vi"" down a makeshift latrine along with the Primus tape. Good riddance.God-awful bad."
4,n64 top-down goodness,"one of my all time favorites for the n64. in my opinion one of the best looking games for the system. if you like the genre and you're interested in playing older games pick this one up. i know this game won't make many people's short list, however, if you are into spaceships, lasers and are a huge nerd you'll know you'll like it. if you are not a fan of shooters don't pick it up."
3,Hope Of The States. The Lost Riots discovered.,"Hope Of The States seems to be jumping on, or rather influenced by, this recent wave of thumping post-punk garage-rock-type bands, although more darker and cinematic sounding. 'Lost Riots' opens with the stunning 'The Black Amnesias', an interesting blend of Godspeed You Black Emperor's orchestral rock and post-punk guitars. The rest of the CD maintains a dreamy, dense, spikey sound, The Rapture-esque rhythms and riffs, and experimental/orchestral noodling falling somewhere in between Broken Social Scene and Godspeed You Black Emperor. As if there are not enough twists, thrown into the post-punk meets orchestral rock mix are Raine Maida-type vocals, almost bordering on pop-punk-type vocals. 'Lost Riots' could be described as The Rapture meets Muse, grandiose as it is edgey, sonic as it is ominous."
1,Dud !,"when you listen to dreck like this,you realize how great MUSE is.no wonder the guitar player killed himself !"
3,Star Trek: The Forgotten Series....,"I didn't watch Enterprise in first run. Partly because Voyager had been such a let down and then I missed the pilot. It is much like DS9 in the that it is best viewed more or less in order. (Prodcution/viewing order gets skewed a bit in season two.) Last summer I watched all but a handful of episodes on the feed from Star Trek.com. Free yes-- but it had a few episodes missing including one of the highlights of Season One- Dear Doctor. This is probably the strongest first season of any Star Trek save for original. Are there some clunkers-- yes. But overall the good outweigh the bad. Scott Bakula, John Billingsley and Prada the Dog do some great work here. The rest of the cast is good enough."
4,Great prequel concept,"Many obsessive Star Trek fans (and I've dealt with some, by selling Star Trek toys on Ebay to people who wanted the plastic holders that came in the box, not just the box itself!) hate this show because they forget that there were missions before Kirk. A problem with the first season was that Scott Bakula never seemed to be comfortable in the role of Archer. Also, some of the story lines were interchangeable with other Trek shows, the episode ""Terra Nova"" in particular reminded me of the Voyager episode, ""Friendship One."" However, there were very good episodes, like ""Silent Enemy."" The Temporal Cold War actually fits into the Voyager episode ""Relativity"" where it is established that in the distant future, the Federation becomes the guardian of the ""True"" timeline."
3,Same as other,"As I have written in another seasons review,Good show but Why so much money for this series?Cannot justify so much money as you can get others for half this price."
4,Star Trek fans will enjoy Enterprise.,"If you're a fan of previous installments like Next Generation or Voyager, then this series will at least entertain you for its compatibility with the series - and its attempt to portray the world of Star Trek before Star Trek."
1,"Awful, awful Trek series","Don't waste your money on Enterprise. It's boring, unoriginal, poorly acted, poorly written, and just a disaster from start to finish. Sadly, this Trek is dreck."
1,Disappointed,"I downloaded this show and was unable to play it. I had to roll back Windows Media Player 11 to 10. When that was done, I lost all of my downloaded music (digital rights). Still could not play movie. Re-installed Media Player 11 and music was still unobtainable. Lost the $2 for the show and $25 or more dollars worth of music. Not very happy with this product!"
1,Franchise Killer,"This show was so bad it killed the franchise. I love Star Trek and this sad excuse ended the era. On the other series you liked the characters but not this bunch,with the exception of Jolene Blalock's character. The lead actor had the charisma of a paper cup. I remember hearing that he was cast in the lead role and I knew instantly it would be bad. I even hate the terrible theme music. BlueRay won't improve this disaster. I wouldn't buy this over-priced disaster for $10.00 let alone $84.00."
5,As soon as I can pay my credit card down!!!!,"I saw these when they first came out on TV & I'm psyched that they're hitting DVD! (But ____ed that UPN's cancelling Enterprise--do they think they'd exist if it weren't for Star Trek? And they're doing it based on possibly fouled-up ratings: http://www.saveenterprise.com/nielsensbotched.htm)It's on my wish list now if any wonderful people out there want to send it to me. Otherwise, the first chance I get, it's MINE!!!If you're as ticked (my fifth-choice word but kids might read this) as me that Enterprise is getting canceled, check out http://www.saveenterprise.com ."
1,wrong,My item was sent very quickly! But i ordered season 1 i was sent season 2 very un satisfied at this point 2 does no go without 1
1,worst star trek episode ever,i love star trek but this was truly awful. worst episode ever. i don't know if the acting or the story was worse but probably the acting. skip it and save your time.
1,"Awful series, sad ending for the Star Trek franchise","I've always been a fan of Star Trek, from the original series, but I thought Enterprise was just awful. I think it started with the guy they chose for the captain. He is not a good actor and to the extent he has any talent its much better suited to comedy than action adventure. The rest of the cast was also mediocre. Most of the stories just made me grown they had so many holes in the plot or were so contrived and predictable."
5,Best Star Trek series out there!!!,Excellent actors; nothing too violent; great meaning. My husband and I think this is the BEST and we highly recommend it!!
2,A warp-speed log,"A trekkie's log... Stardate: present day... Mission: To explore the Enterprise First Season DVD? This IS an anomoly. PROS: (1) Fine ships, make-up and set design make it fun to compare the evolution of the Star Trek timeline. (2) The use of the Universal Translator and Space Suits add a realistic touch. (3) A dog on board. Puppies rule! CONS: (1) the characters are ""lost in space"", for example, the captain is a peaceful explorer, then suddenly, a vengeful tyrant. The writers can't decide. (2) A vulcan with emotions and sexual needs is illogical. (3) The ranting crewman with a heavy country twang? Get serious! Someone please beam him up... and OUT! (4) Beware of the future season when there is a war with a council of aliens, like the insect race. Can anybody say Star Wars rip-off, a la Geonosis? My advice is just get ST: Nex Gen which contains the smartest writing and best cast, faithful to Gene Roddenberry's legacy! Live long..."
2,Archer kills the show,"Archer is awful. He recently played the role of a coach for a sports team, and he is reprisiing that role. He is just a coach, spouting trite comments and his acting is juvenile.Otherwise, I am a big fan of the other Star Trek series, but this is a real disappointment."
4,"Very Good Show, Awful Theme Song","It took me a few tries to get into this show only because the theme song is absolutely repulsive (it is definitely in the top 10 worst songs I've ever heard). Don't know why they deviated from the classical themes that are standard for all other Star Treks. Anyway, as long as you mute the theme song the show is great! Even the in-show music is excellent. This show contains some interesting Star Trek ""history"", since it occurs before Kirk's time. One of its most interesting aspects is that it explores the development of the relationship between humans and Vulcans. In fact it is the most Vulcan-centric Star Trek I've seen (in the same way that Voyager was the most Borg-centric). Long story short, don't forget to mute that theme song or you may run away screaming and miss a really good show!"
3,RIDE THE WAVE,"The episode that marked a shift in the television series that continues the epic of the STAR TREK Universe, ""Shockwave"" should have rumbled -- instead it pops and fizzles!"
3,be patient,"If you can make it past the bizarre Diane Warren theme song (don't know what they were thinking!), the first two seasons of Enterprise are pretty mediocre, but stick with it! Season 3 & 4 are really good! All the things done in the first two seasons that make no sense (like the emotional vulcan) will start to make sense in very interesting ways.Unfortunately, by then, most people (myself included) had stopped watching and the show on television and it was cancelled. I wish network execs would be a little more patient! Or they should release things on dvd quicker, so people can catch up and get hooked. I miss the days of long summer reruns when I could catch up on shows I didn't get to see because they were up against other favorites.Jonathan Archer is no Picard or Kirk, he's somewhat one dimentional, but after 9/11 (filmed during season 3) his character comes to life."
4,good series,"I like the writing and the stories of the series, I like the interaction between the actors,never had the opportunity to see when it was made,it has been enjoyable to have the chance to watch it,Thank you Amazon"
4,trekkie or not?,i am a very big fan of star trek and ive gotta say to me it is a very good show and i just bought the 2nd season at suncoast i would reccomend you buy it
3,Overpriced,This is WAY too much to pay for a TV series! I would never buy it at this price. I could understand a price of POSSIBLY $60 never $90. I do love the show!
3,Too expensive,"I liked the series, even if I hated the temporal cold war arc. However, while there are people who may be able to afford this at full price, I can not. If this were more affordably priced, say $40 a season, I would buy it."
5,Star Trek Enterprise season 1 review,Item got to me in the promised condition and speedy delivery.Star Trek Enterprise is an awesome show
4,Enterprise: First Season,"I was a bit skeptical of this show when I first bought, but found that I really enjoyed the first season...it has all sorts of things that hint at what's to come on the ``Star Trek'' original series. The only thing I don't like about the show, especially what's to come, is a particular thread that was inserted dealing with time travel...but I'd come to learn that that wasn't solely the creators' doing, but at the behest of the studio. That said, I definitely enjoyed the first season and would obviously recommend it to die-hard `Trek' fans, but also casual fans of sci-fi, tho in that case, I'd suggesting renting it through Netflix or Blockbuster."
3,Star Trek Fatique,"By the time this series rolled along the Star Trek franchise had run out of gas. I think the franchise was more tired and worn out. The Next Generation film were truly unworthy. As a TV series, this one fits in the middle--the original and Next Generation at the top and Voyager and Deep Space Nine at the bottom.Could of and should have been better, but viewing after the fact makes a bit better."
3,This series never was able to hold my attention,"Than again, DS9 could not either, until I bought the boxed season 1 and eagerly purchased all the rest. I don't hold much hope that ENT will have the same affect, sadly. I don't know if I'll buy into this series, literally. I do know that I pray that Paramount has something new in the works."
5,I enjoyed this series.,"I thought this series had a nice, comfortable, retro kind of feel that felt like watching an 'enhanced' version of the original series. I don't think it was pretending to be anything more. Take it on its own merits, enjoy it simply for what it is, and I think it stands up just fine all on its own.Take my opinion for what it's worth folks. I'm not a 'die-hard' Trek fan. My Trek experiences are severely limited, mostly exposed to the original series and early Next Generation stuff. I'm no expert here. All I'm saying is that with my limited knowledge of the Trek universe, I personally was not disappointed in the least, and will now pre-order this set. And as an admitted Trek-novice, I do recommend reading some other reviews by people who are more knowledgable of the subject before you decide."
4,Interesting,Only watched a couple of episodes and i don't think it is as good as Deep Space Nine but worth watching.
3,"Worked okay, but not great.","This seemed to be clearing up my fishes spots, I used 4 doses of it, then had to stop since I didn't have the time to clean out 25% of my 65 gallon tank that it recommends cleaning out before using any more doses. I will try doing another 3 rounds of this and see if that does the trick. Hopefully so.Update: This product worked reasonably well keeping my fishes ick at bay, none of my other fish picked it up. What ended up clearing it up for good was replacing the light on my UV filter that I hadn't known went out (which is why my fish got Ick in the first place). If you have a larger tank and have problems with ick and fungus, look into getting a UV filter like a Turbo Twist. This product works okay for keeping Ick down, but did not cure my fish, only my UV light eventually did the trick. Also a UV light will prevent the problem in the first place, so you won't need products like this."
5,Works well,I had a very minor outbreak of Ich (only a couple of fish had any signs at all) so I was fortunate to catch it early. I medicated at half strength for 5 days which killed all the Ich in the tank. I also turned the heat up gradually over 2 days to 85 degrees and left it hotter than usual for about a week. The heat helps to kill the Ich larvae.
4,"black death, AIDS","depends on what you want to know about aids, somewhat helpful to add to my understanding"
2,"No Discipline, Like the Sixties","I am really tempted to give this just one star, based on how disappointing this attempt at a very interesting novel became. While my title may suggest a disapproval with the sociology of what is known as ""the sixties"" (which began in the mid-sixties and lingered into the mid-seventies), that is not my perspective. In fact, one of the aspects of the novel I liked was the author's dispassionate approach to a fascinating era.What ultimately made the novel a failure for me was the lack of direction (loosely chronological) and order for this book. There are about 2 1/2 books in this novel, and it never became clear to me how exactly they related, other than the author's own uninsightful juxtapositions. Too bad. Perhaps this is yet another failure due to the illiterate marketing hounds of the publishing world: This book desperately needed a knowledgeable and skillful editor."
2,Disappointing.,"After reading rave reviews here, I expected much more than this tedious, repetitive novel. I'd already reached my fill by about halfway through, but as I continued to turn the pages, I found that the author had found more and more ways to flog a dead horse. Not recommended."
5,Excellent,"I believed totally in these characters and accepted everything they did as the truth. This novel contained almost no cliches. Each character, even Georgette's downtrodden mother, was specific and individualized.I am about three years older than the two women in this book and did not participate in the drug culture. I did, however, participate in the anti Vietnam war movement. This book recalls those tulmultuous times to perfection, without hype.I recommend this highly to anyone who wants to read a really intelligent, thoughtful book about women, their relationships with each other and with men, about politics, the Sixties and New York City."
5,Incisive and absorbing,"Incisive and absorbing portrayal of the troubled friendship between two Barnard College roommates, working class Georgette and wealthy Ann."
4,A Good Read Especially If You Lived Through This Time!,"This is an exceptionally well-written book. Ms. Nunez captures the time with great authenticity. I was in school during this era, and many episodes discussed in this book took place at my university. Characters are well defined as are certain situations. The level of Ann's commitment ""to the cause"" might be questionable to some readers. There were some passages requiring patience [rock concerts, drug use, etc.], however, the characters were so compelling that they captured my attention, and I read this through to the very end. I glad I did this since the writing is far above average!! It's worth reading!"
2,This Book was Disappointing,"Although I began the book with great expectations, I quickly became bored and disillusioned. It reads as a political tract and it often felt as though the author had written an autobiography outlining her own experiences of the 60's. The story didn't flow after the first few chapters; it might as well have been a newspaper report. I'd skip it if an engrossing novel is what you're expecting."
3,More Minutes!!,"The film score is excellent, absolutely brilliant...but the soundtrack is lacking quite abit music that was from the movie/trailer. The trailer score isnt even included (and that song is sooo moving), and the CD only has 35 minutes of tracks. Although the tracks are great, I wish they would include more from the film."
4,Good Fun!!,This movie is a great deal of wholesome sci-fi FUN! A good movie to watch for its impressive special effects. It doesn't require a good deal of thinking and analyzing. Just enough to be an interesting sci-fi THRILLER you can enjoy with home-made popcorn!!
3,A High-Tech Thriller,"An extremly high-tech computer virus terrorizes a community by turning electrical devices into weapons with a mind of their own. If you've seen and enjoyed movies like ""Pulse"" and ""Ghost in the Machine"" then you should enjoy this one."
4,Even Better than Namco 1!,"Namco Museum 3 (third in a series of five collections of old arcade hits) hits some high and low spots, but is well worth the purchase price for three games. The best of the lot is the translation of Ms Pac-Man - very faithful to the original. Galaxian is highly addictive and equally faithful to the original. Most people don't give Dig-Dug the credit it's due - it is very entertaining - even for adults. I rather liked Dig-Dug in the arcades, and this is a good rendition. On the other hand, ""Phozon"" and ""Tower of Druga"" are very forgettable, ""Tower"" the most worthless of the lot. Still well worth buying just for the excellent Ms Pac Man."
3,Only a couple are fun,I thought this would be exciting and nostalgic but after trying each game I found the only ones I liked to play were Ms. Pacman and DigDug. Ms. Pacman takes some getting use to on the Playstation controller instead of the joystick of the original arcade game. I probably play DigDug more and after awhile the games just get plain boring -- but I guess when you're not having to put quarters in and have unlimited game playing time that will happen.
4,Carly sez: Namco Museum Vol.3 is four stars worth o'fun!,"This game is a lot of fun for such a small price tag! It features all of the same graphics and programming as the original arcade versions and even boasts an arcade mode. This means that if you're buff enough to tip your TV on it's side, you can relive that long-screen appearance of the old stand-up games. I like being able to choose up to five lives on Ms.Pacman and Dig Dug. This allows me to take rare possession of the playstation from my boyfriend's grip. He bores after watching me play my hundredth game of Ms.Pacman! You can play for hours on all four of the choice games: Ms.Pacman, Pole Position II, Dig Dug and Galaxian. This game loses one star for including two so-so games that must've been popular in Japan or something: Phozon and Tower of Druaga. Relive one of the best things about the 80s - video games! Hey, you may find you're even better at them now then you were back in tha day!"
3,Sttudent,This text book is good for a brief overview of the topic. It is not in detail. I think a few more solved examples with detailed references to equation would have been good. I general I wouldn't say its one of the best texts I have used. To be honest it is not up to the mark but it isn't that bad either. in short it is slightly above average.
2,krap-PS1 never had any good FPS games!,"DOOM was much better on Nintendo 64!-PS1 didn`t have FPS in their ""Talent"" genre-N64 did.The Three games machines that had the best FPS games genre as a ""talent"" was:PCNINTENDO 64XBOXDOOM was ok on PS1 but not a good."
5,CLASSIC GAMING FUN!,One of the greatest shooting games ever. You play as a stranded space marine on the moons of Mars Phobos and Demios. Creatures from hell spawn from broken military portals on the moons. You must kill all the creatures on both moons then you go to the underworld {hell} and make sure no monster gets to earth alive. You WILL have to get out of there when your finished{of course}. You will find out more when play it cause words just cant describe all of it.
4,Sweet Baby James Is Born,"There is nothing like the raw simplicity of a new artist's initial work, and this album is no exception. Little wonder that APPLE and Peter Asher saw the genius that is James Taylor back in London in '68. And thank God for that!James' talent is attested to by his musical longevity and the respect he is given by other perhaps bigger-selling artists.It is often said that genius comes from pain. James' debut solo effort whilst on heroin & coming to terms with an unfathomable world is ... well ... simply fabulous and the versions of 'Carolina In My Mind' and 'Something In The way she Moves', to my mind, are far superior here to the later slicker versions he did.Sure, this talented musician went on to write several more great hits as he ""matured"" into the mellower performer & writer he is today, but for me, this beats the lot! A must-have!"
4,Still Worth Listening To,"James Taylor was the first musician other than the Beatles to release an album on Apple records. It's easy to see why the Beatles saw talent in this guy. The songs on this album, while darker than the usual James Taylor, have depth and substance, and an emotional undercurrent running beneath them. Standards such as ""Gone to Carolina"" and ""Something in the Way She Moves"" are performed here with more passion and authenticity than when they were re-recorded for the ""Greatest Hits"" album. Occasionally the arrangements sound a little crude and outdated, but that is more than compensated by the sheer power of the music. All true James Taylor fans should have this album in their collection."
2,Pathic,"These were some wonderful,simple songs. Then some dink comes along and over aranges them. It just plain too much tinkering"
4,"Wonderfull, but not his best","A wonderfull live recording, where Cohen shows what I've missed the last time he was in town (and I wasn't :-(I especially like this version of ""Who By Fire"" which even beats the original (which would definitely be hard to beat by anyone else), but also many others.The only downside is actually the amazing variety of Cohen's songs. And since a live concert is always some kind of retrospective, this record is not as homogenous as most of his others.My recommendation: If you're new to Leonard Cohen, get either ""Songs of Love and Hate"", or the wonderfull sampler ""The Best of Leonard Cohen"". But this record should come soon after one of them."
5,Excellent 'album',"Leonard at one of his finest performances. This is an awesome, fabulous CD; highly recommended! Money most definitely well spent."
4,Toronto rocks,"This is northern searing soul mixed with imagery no one else would dream of committing to disc (Jean d'Arc being licked by flames...) For my money there are two absolutely outstanding tracks, the first and the last. The first, Dance me to the end of Love, is good to remember a failed transatlantic relationship by. The last, Suzanne, stops you in your tracks and fills your eyes with tears for the human 'condition.'"
2,"great songs, bad arrangements","Leonard Cohen has a knack for writing incredible songs and then arranging them in the cheesiest possible way. Fantastic lyrics, wonderful chord progressions and the worst casio keyboard and electronic drum sounds you have ever heard. I bought this disk because the jacket had some of my favorite Cohen songs on it (ie Bird on a Wire, Hallelujah, and Joan of Ark), but found it very hard to listen to the live versions of these songs."
2,the concert to be missed,"If you want clasic Cohen, albums that rank as some of the best music has to offer over the past 50 years, then I suggest buying Songs Of Love and Hate or Songs From A Room or New Skin. This ""live"" cd was recorded over a six year period and is a labor to listen to, it is one of the few cds I own (out of thousands) that I am very tempted to fast forward. All the brilliant attributes that Cohen brings in many of his previous studio albums from the early days is entirely voided in this live experience. This cd is overproduced and has a slumber like quality, heck, I would go as far as saying that it feels like Spector was behind the production (we all know Death Of A Ladies Man was lame and Leonard acknowlegdes this himself). I would recommend this cd to die hard Cohen fans who must have every cd from his carrer (like myself)."
3,classic study guide,"This is a classic study guide on Romans. Much better resources are now available today. Check out, for example, the commentaries by Osborne in IVP New Testament Commentary Series and Moo in NIV Application Commentary Series."
4,What a strong book!,"The interwoven generational stories were very powerful and the grief in the book is palatable. I wanted to take Mimi, the main character by the hand and talk to her, and promise her that the pain would go away.The author has achieved something very real and true with this book. It is a haunting story of grief, missed loved, and the nature of healing."
1,Basic and somewhat crude as a whole,This is rough and ready music with a hard-nose seamy side like chopper music melodramatic and somewhat crude in tone.
5,Wow,One of the greatest Richard Thompson albums ever made - therefore one of the greatest albums ever made.
3,A different feel than other Saint-Germain novels,"I'd read a number of other of Yarbro's Saint-Germain novels before coming back to this first book in the series, and it was a bit of a surprise. For all that this book was written in 1978, it reminds me more of Laurell K. Hamilton's Anita Blake series than do the other Saint-Germain books. While Saint-Germain is impotent, the bad guys here revel in sexual torture and rape as part of their Satanic rituals (boy, that sounds cheesy, but it works in this Gothic setting). While the detail is less graphic than Hamilton's more recent stories, these are not passages comfortable for the faint of heart. A good read, though the series gets better as it matures."
3,Caution...F-bomb is droped,"This is a good movie. My 6 yr old realy likes it. However, towards the begining of the movie, when the boy shows up to check in, he says, ""I can't F-ing breath under here"" when he is under all the suit cases. I had to replay it several times to believe what I was hearing."
4,Different kind of Vampire tale,"To be honest, I haven't read a lot of vampire books. I've got the basics, like Dracula and Varney, and I watched Buffy and Angel religiously and even read some of those books. I read several PN Elrod books, Laurel Hamilton books, and a few other authors' takes on the vampire mythos. But even so, this seems very different to me. For one thing, the whole blood drinking thing isn't overdone. Yes, it happens, but it's not a huge part of the story - almost blink & you miss it. This vampire can also walk in daylight just by wearing shoes with dirt from his homeland.I don't know how historically accurate the details are, but they SEEMED real. The writing is beautiful and lyrical, so though this isn't the kind of fast-paced adventure story I prefer, it was such a good read that I've already bought the sequel. (The Palace, though since these aren't in chronological order, it probably doesn't matter.)"
2,Dissapointed,"I'm a huge ND fan, and I'll be the first to defend his music, but ""Live in America"" is not one of his better live recordings. He almost talks through most of the songs, the sound of some (SOME!)of these recordings on this album sound muffled, as if someone snuck a hand-held tape recorder into a concert. There are some decent tracks where the sound quality improves. ""Missa"" ,""Soolaimon"", ""Havah Nagilah"" are some examples.Look for ""Hot August Night"", ""Hot August Night II"" ""Neil Diamond Gold"" or even ""Love at the Greek"" if you're looking for a concert album. I own ""Live in America"", but I got the CD at a second hand record shop. I couldn't see myself paying full price for it."
1,Neil just ain't what he used to be!`,"I have had a love affair (one-sided of course) with Neil Diamond for over 25 years. This was the only album of his that I did not own. I was so very disappointed with it, as it does little to capture the excitement of his live concert and only serves to emphasize that his voice is growing older with all the rest of us. He is still awesome in concert ( saw him 2 years ago with my 80 year old Mom and we had fun!) but that electricity is not translated to this CD. A waste of my money. Sorry, Neil"
1,This isn't Neil,"I have to agree with alot of the reviewers, reflected in the title I have chosen for my review. I bought this CD the NIGHT it was released, and have grown up with Neil's music and anxiously waited this release.....but I took it back to the store within 2 days. If you are a Neil FANATIC, you might add this to your collection, but if you are a realist, you will find this recording pathetic...He SHOULD be embarrassed. I saw him recently on A&E's Live By Request and THAT is a Neil Diamond live performance! So, I don't necessarily think it's his age. I do think Neil rules and is quite a performer...just not THIS night."
1,CRACK!,"I bought this for a buck at a pawn shop, and still I felt cheated. I love Neil Diamond, but this recording is THE WORST. Neil is not singing at all...He's pretty much just speaking these songs. It sounds like a bad recording of your grandfather reading Neil Diamond lyrics to you as a bedtime story. The best sound I heard out of this CD was the sound of the hefty double-CD case cracking and splintering into a million pieces as it hit the pavement at 75mph after I threw it out the window on the interstate."
1,AWFUL,"Do not buy this. Neil Diamond gives you a box set showing just how bad his greatest material can sound when you scream out lyrics, and fall into Vegas. If you want good later live stuff get 1966-1992.Sometimes I wonder who advised Neil on some of this stuff. He can be so great like on ""Tennessee Moon"" and ""12 Songs,"" and then he can be just plain lame."
1,ND at his self-aggrandizing worst,"This is one stinker of a CD. From the opening phrases, where Diamond is doing *something* but I wouldn't dare call it singing, it's nausea-inducing.The only thing interesting about this is how on earth they got all the sounds of a cheering crowd in the background."
5,Neil Diamond forever baby!,"I'm sick of all the critics dissing Neil Diamond. Sure, he might not be the most talented guy ever, but that's not the point of music. The point of music is the feeling you get from listening to it, and you can't help but feel great listening to all these hits live. Neil Diamond is the man and is one of the greats of the late 20th century!"
3,coolcoolcool,"well theres tons of different levels and stages you can go through.each fighter has his own special powers.before you get started youll need to inject caffiene directly into your thumbs to keep up with the computer guy.at first you should take lou kang.hes the easiest guy to learn.everythings easy once your caffiene kicks in up un til you run into goro.hes not even the boss but hes the toughest guy by far on every level.hes a big huge guy who can kill you in like 5 hits.when you hit him,it barely fazes him.just do something repeatedly like raiden[theres a real japanese god called raiden] and his torpedo spear or quan chis tele stomp.the fatalities are very gruesome.one involves a guy ripping off the other dudes leg and then beating him to death with it.ps-for some stupid reason all the cs are ks in this game."
2,[Mortal Kombat 4],"Ive Been A Mortal Kombat fan for years.But i was very dissapointed When Mortal kombat 4 Came out.The thing that attracted me to the 1st mortal kombat in the fist place was they used actual people in the game that made it distinktive from many other games, And i belive when people were suggesting to have it in the 3d formatt its that they wanted actual charecters (people) like in part 1,2&3 But in 3 dementianal backgrounds and 3d actual people charecters. Plus i think they bombarded the charecter Rayden he Looks Sorry. Hopefully they will return to useing actual charecters"
2,"Good game,Bad images","This is a great game for the N64. The controles are not that bad. I got this game because it was for the N64 and we all know how N64 is GREAT.Now we all know what Mortal Kombat is blood,guts,and more blood.The MK series is okay the game has a good story the fallen elder god shinnok has found the amulet and is of coursewell killing people. The game has some old charecters and some new ones like Shinnok,Tanya, Jerek, Kai,the game is okay but has some bad stuff like... too much blood and fallen heads there are some people i found creepy looking like Goro,and quin chi they were very ugly there is even a part of the game that you see the devil killing someone. That goes too far I have quit playing games like this. Trust me don't buy this game you will notlike IT!!!!!"
2,Too bloody!,"This has got to be the worst Mortal Kombat game in the series. The blood looks like squares, and there is too much of it. Also, some of the fatalities are so sick that I can't even look at them!If you like this kind of game, you still may want to rent it first."
2,Worst MK GAME EVER!,I love MK games but this one really made me mad. It was way to bloody! Some Fatalities might offened some people because one of them shows the devil turning a guy into a walking dead maniac! Plus I have betten it but it was way to easy! NO FUN AT ALL!
1,Final Draft,"I never liked James Van Der Beek. I dont know why but I think it was because he was the bully in the film Angus. Considering I dont think I only saw the film once on tv and ten or more years ago, it stuck with me. Anyways, you can read the synposis of the movie. The acting is bad, the movie is slow paced, and just plain sucked. I wouldnt recommend anyone watch it."
1,Terrible!,Final Draft is directed very poorly and the plot line isn't much either. This movie drags on forever and has no direction. It's just a bunch of unnecessary loud noises. I tried to watch this movie tonight and I lost interest after 5 minutes. Don't waste your time on this one.
4,Gray captures the essence of male & female relationships,"ABC joins in on a John Gray seminar in which couples are seeking help with their marital problems. It takes a very specific look at the very difficult and complicated world of the female and male relationships. He describes how the man and the woman communicate, deal with their problems, release stress, etc. and is able to show how each sex is different. John Gray shows how to accept the opposite sexes ways of dealing with everyday life situations through realizing each others differences. From this video, you will get a very large insight into the way that several couples began with difficulties, and through the advanced understanding of each other were able to work through their problems and make life worth living together."
3,A Mixed Bag According to One Book Group,"Our book group felt that there were some interesting points made and the book provided good insights on certain relationship issues with a fresh perspective. The point was well taken that men and women communicate differently about emotional issues. However, the group consensus was that this book did not offer any really helpful answers. It was felt that the writing was over-clarified, too repetitive, and drawn out. It almost seemed that all one had to do was read the sentences in dark print. A shorter version would have been preferred. Many were of the opinion that the book was written for a woman's improvement. The tone was condescending, often slick and arrogant. Some of the solutions Gray offers verge on the chauvinistic: go shopping, call a friend, eat something delicious. Makes one think: HOGWASH! END"
2,Won't come off in the wind?,"Very good quality but will definitely come off in a wind blowing at 15 to 20 mph or more. The wind also has a tendency to blow beneath the table and chairs causing the cover to balloon upward which assists in its rapid removal. You need to tie the Velcro straps to the chair and table legs with a knot in order for it to remain in place thus making it difficult to remove easily. The manufacture definitely needs to come up with a better way of attaching the cover to table and chair legs. They might also want to consider providing small sandbags to place on top of the table to help prevent ballooning.I'm going to try two Hugger Mugger Yoga Sandbags from Amazon.comUPDATE: August 2011. If you want your furniture to remain dry during a heavy rain fall, do not buy this item! It leaks like a sieve at the seams. As result I'm down grading product to two stars."
2,tie down velcro straps,"I like the fabric, nice and smooth and flexible, but, the velcro straps are not sewn on very well. The first windy day one of the straps tore loose from the cover. I have a commercial sewing machine, so, I sewed it back on, and re-sewed all the other ones on better. The next windy day, the strap tore completely off. If you live in an area with lots of wind, be leery of this cover. Also, since it's sold by Amazon, you can't get in touch with the manufacturer."
5,Perfect,I was pleased to see that the material was thick and durable. So far it has withstood high winds and storms.
5,Great outdoor furniture cover.,"So far I like this cover for my table, it fits the table, allbeit a bit large but still perfect for the table. It has many velcro tie downs so the cover stays in place even during high winds, I like this feature on the cover. I purchased this cover to protect my table which is left outdoors during our Buffalo winters. Between the wind, rain and snow I am hoping this cover will hold up well. So far is has withstood the wind and rain and is still in one piece. It is much too early for the snow but I have great expectations it will hold up well. This is a very good product for the money.I have had this table cover since 2009 and it has withstood the last three Western New York winters and is still in great condition. My table is kept outdoors year round due to its size and this cover is still in great condition. Worth every cent I spent on this table cover and more. If ever need to replace it would not hesitate to purchase exact cover. Would recomend to a friend."
4,Suprisingly good!,"I bought this CD off a clearance rack in the Bay Area because it had a song I remember that was played on the radio quite a bit a few years ago (that would be the song A Girl Like You). I was suspecting the rest of the CD to be filler songs, but was very suprised when they all turned out to be well written and performed. Two of the songs owe a great deal to the Beatles, but I'll let the listener figure out which two. Overall a very good CD."
3,11 Has Some Moderate Moments,"New Jersey's Smithereens is a band of popular rootsy rock (way before the sounds of Matchbox 20 and Hootie). I have had this CD since its release in 1989. The standout track, ""A Girl Like You,"" is a nice toe-tapper as well as ""William Wilson."" There is a problem, for a lot of the songs sound the same. ""Blue Period,"" however, stands on its own with help from Go-Go Belinda Carlisle. All in all, a good effort for pop-rock fans."
4,Few,"My dad has this CD of it. If heard ""A Girl Like You"" at Home Depot. My mom has one song on her recorded cassette. I wonder if they have a greatest hits album."
4,The Space Cowboy Begins Countdown to Superstardom,"My love affair with the Steve Miller Band began in 1973 when this album was first released. I was a junior at UNL and as usual was spending way too much time hanging out at my favorite record store when ""The Joker"" came over the in-store stereo system. Needless to say, I left the store with a copy of the album and just recently upgraded to CD. While this is not as strong of a collection of songs as his follow-ups (Fly Like an Eagle, Book of Dreams), there is much to enjoy here besides the catchy single, ""The Joker,"" which was his first Top 40 hit. Originals like ""Sugar Babe"" and the bluesy ""The Lovin' Cup"" are first-rate. Also, live versions of ""Come On In My Kitchen"" and ""Evil"" show the band in fine form. Casual fans might better be served by a greatest hits collection, but this is required listening for fans who want to dig into the artist's catalog a little deeper. RECOMMENDED"
3,Disappointing effort from the Gangster,"Most an album of cover songs, luckily Steve hits gold with song The Joker, otherwise it's white funk and tired blues. Steve needs a well deserved break."
4,Strong Material,"Classic rock greatness from Steve Miller. Guitar playing is good, it has the necessary commercial hits, and the band rocks hard. I really feel this is the first Steve Miller release that separated him a song writer, as opposed to a jam band player. I recommend it!!"
3,Not Steve Millers Best Album,"The Joker is an average album, by a great artist. This is far from being concederd one of Steve Millers best. This is very un even. You have a couple of pretty decent songs, a couple of bad ones and one absolute rock and roll classic.The Joker is filled with differnt songs, which is why this isnt a very concistant album. 'The Joker' is the best song on the album and thats not suprizing concedering its the best song Steve Miller ever recorded. The rest of the album almost seems like its all just filler. 'Marry Lou' is a pretty decent song, but it still falls short. There are maybe one or two other good songs here and the rest is just filler.I wouldnt recomend this album to people because it simplly isnt that good, its mostly just filler. If you like the song 'The Joker' I would buy a compelation album like Young Hearts, because this album is almost a complete waste of money. If you want some good Steve Miller go with Fly Like An Eagle, or Book Of Dreams."
5,Great CD for anyone who loved O Clone,"This is a great cd! Its a great combination of songs from the soap opera ""O Clone"".Para todos los fans de la novela ""El Clon"", les recomiendo el cd.Tiene canciones de diferentes interpretes."
5,O Clone,"This soap-opera is the best in Brasilian history... I watched this soap when it first started in the Brasilian channel GLOBO. It is not only a great love story but also deals with everyday issues like drug and alchohol dependency, racial and cultural differences, etc.The soundtracks complement the soap in a way that I haven't seen before. The middle eastern ballads are beautiful!!"
3,Not as daintly as I would like,"I was looking for a dainty little bracelet for my ankle and this does not fit the bill once I saw it in person. I think that the spheres are a bit too big for my taste and it does not have that feminine dainty look that I was going for. This is what happens when an item is bought online sight unseen. No fault of the seller, of course, just not to my personal liking. However, item was as described and looks exactly like the pic. Others may like it though."
3,art without a story,I like Milo Manaras art but it is especially enjoyable with the story. This is wonderful book of his best art of women but just images.Just in case to mention. I would have been thankful to get this kind of hint when I was buying.For those of you looking for fine images - strong yes.
1,Not worth the price,"I love Manara's work and have about 6 of his other books. This book mostly contained duplicate artwork published elsewhere, and not even his best work. Not worth the price. Buy the Click or Butterscotch series instead."
3,Good art. Little wierd,"I liked it. Of course I knew I would I like Manara's artwork. Little wierd on some of it. To be expected from someone who worked so closely with Heavy Metal. I don't think I'll buy another collection, but if you are liked Heavy Metal you should love this collection. Hard cover too which surprised me."
4,Songs from 1958,"This CD is 51 minutes and 48 seconds long and has some of the best songs from that year. Conway Twitty's It's Only Make Believe, Ricky Nelson's Lonesome Town, and Jimmie Rodgers Sceretly are some of the great songs on the CD. Also on the inside of the cover it tells you whether or not a song chart; and if it did, how far up the charts it went. An example is Earl Grant's The End made it to #7."
2,5 FEET TALL IN THE LAND OF MIDGETS,"Stephen King is the best horror writer I know of, and that isnt saying much when you consider how untalented all the competition is. Robert Bloch is the exception. King will never equal Bloch's PSYCHO, and I truly love some of King's books....SALEM'S LOT, CARRIE, CHRISTINE, THE LANGOLIERS, SHANKSHAW REDEMPTION, THE GREEN MILE. DOLAN'S CADILLAC is a sublime short story.But King is soooo uneven as a writer; 90% of what he writes is mind numbing, inane chatter with eruptions of genius. King's books are packed with more stuff than Santa's sleigh, and are busier than Katrina looters. The man needs an editor bad! Not sycophants.This book, THE ESSENTIAL STEPHEN KING, is a sycophant's pilgrimage to Mecca or Lourdes.Kings best book isnt IT, it's CARRIE."
2,Don't waste your money,"The more I read of this book, the more it seemed like a little mind-trip of self-indulgence for the author. It's very difficult to take this book seriously when observing some of the comments the author makes. For each book he rated there was a section called ""What I liked about this book,"" and more than once his only comment in this section was, ""everything."" While it's nice to see that he's truely writing about something he enjoys, maybe the author should stick to something more modest, such as a column in the local paper, rather than such an ambitious undertaking as this. While not truely awful, the ambiguous format makes it painful reading."
4,9,"Spignesi is a great fan(atic) of King's and his enthusiasm shows in this listing of the top 101 King writings. He includes a wide variety of King's material from across his career. Anyone who is a fan will enjoy remembering the great stories already read and will be inspired to read ones Spignesi mentions that haven't yet been read.Not all of Spignesi's opinions are correct, of course, but he is well-informed enough to make a strong case for each of his picks."
3,"nice variety, but not very challenging","I was excited to get this dvd, thinking it would be a powerhouse of a workout in a short amount of time. The variety of each segment is great, you won't get bored with the routines buts it certainly isn't very challenging. I did the entire workout without ever breaking a sweat. For a more challenging circuit workout try Jillian Michael's 30 Day Shred, it is a grueling 20 minutes that goes by fast but you will feel it."
2,for beginners,"I just started working out and I am by no means in shape but I do live in the city and walk and climb stairs a lot. Anyway, I was really disappointed with this DVD because it is not very challenging. The instructor and music are great, it's just the pace. It is not fast enough to make me break a sweat or make me lose my breath. I prefer DVD's that really get my heart pumping and make me moderately out of breath. This workout was equivalent to me taking lightly paced stroll for 30 minutes. Comfy, relaxing and not too challenging. Unfortunately I am not here to watch the scenery, I want to lose weight. I would recommend this video to beginner beginners. Otherwise no help at all."
3,Not what I expected..,"Maybe I was just in a hyper mood this morning,but this seemed easy. My heartrate would go up for 5 seconds and then nothing. Might try it again on a day when I need something,but looking for a light workout.I am a beginner and this was just not enough."
5,Wonderful!!!,"Great production quality on this dvd. Bright set, good music, and excellent instruction. Chris Frytag had perfect cuing which made the workout very doable. There was a great deal of variety in this workout and my muscles were challenged. A perfect intermediate level cardio and toning workout. Good job Prevention magazine!!"
2,Not challenging enough,"I enjoyed this video the first few times I did it when returning to working out after an absence. It does have some fun segments such as the salsa dance but overall it is not challenging for me after working out at the gym for a few weeks and my fitness has improved. I pulled it out today because I needed a quick workout but after doing other things my opinion of it has changed. I didn't feel that the cardio or strength intervals were long enough to do much good, I'd just be getting into it and the instructor would move on to something else. Also, the weight repetitions are done too quickly; I had difficulty keeping up with the tempo without swinging the weights and compromising good form. Many of the weight exercises are isolation moves instead of compound, there are more effective ways to strength train. This is definitely a beginner workout and one that anyone who is serious about getting fit will quickly outgrow."
1,Blah,"I am an avid exerciser and put this dvd in the second I received it. I was expecting a lot more. The other reviews made it seem like this is the end-all-be-all of workouts. I am used to doing Tae Bo, The Firm, Turbo Jam and marathon running. I work myself hard-high impact the whole time. I felt NOTHING this whole workout. Sadly, I feel like I wasted 45 minutes of my life trudging through this. I will not recommend this and have 2 more Prevention workouts on their way. I hope I won't be disappointed. This one is a bummer!"
5,"Terrific workout, great instructor, great format","This workout covers all the bases: it offers a workout of all the major body areas, it offers great instruction with variations if you're less fit or looking for a challenge, it is down-to-earth and it's fun to do. I like how the video is divided into segments so you can either do them all or just a few depending on how much time you have. Even if you do just parts of it, you can feel like you've accomplished something and not shut it off in the middle of your workout. This is a worthwhile purchase for anyone looking to improve their physique."
5,Prevention 3-2-1 works!,"Because I know that Prevention puts out a great magazine, I also had a feeling that the exercise DVD they are selling would be nothing short of similar quality. The work out is very good and a lot of fun. The instructor is upbeat, positive and very informative. Even though I already work out with handheld weights, the upper body moves still made my arms a little sore for two days after I tried them out for the first time.I would definitely recommend this DVD and look forward to Prevention producing more in the future!"
5,"Aerobics, Dance, or Strength Training - it has it all!","I recently just stepped up my workout routine and have been searching through tons of DVDs and old work out videos, but this is the winner. It has 6 segments that offer something for everyone and at all levels. I like aerobics/cardio - it's in there. I love to dance - it's in there. I like yoga - it's in there. I needed a video with strngth training - it's in there. And I of course needed an ab workout, and guess what? It's in there. You can not go wrong with this purchase."
4,This is a nice beginner or if you want a light day workout to cover cardio to strenght,"The moves are easy to follow, time goes by fast. I think a beginer would enjoy this workout, intermediate and experienced can use this as one of those lighter workout days. As with any exercise if you bump it up a bit you can get more out of this DVD."
5,great workout,"circuit workouts give maximum results by both burning calories and building muscle (so you also, then, burn more calories even at reast via boosting your metabolism and caloric needs). I, therefore, lean towards the videos that follow this as every current medical conditioning study shows it's the optimum way to get into shape in the least amount of time.But a bad circuit workout does no one any good...and, thankfull, this one is a GOOD one with great firming moves and excellent cardio.The instructor is excellent with cueing and ensuring you do each move correctly and smoothly, my Polar Heart Rate monitor is an F11 so it tells me not only how many calories I burned, but what percent of those calories were fat...and this video delievered both according to my monitor in burning the cals, as well as my enjoyment of doing it and ease of which I could. A fave."
4,A Lot Of Fun,"I LOVE this video only for the fact that I dont like Cardio, I would rather weighttrain.... BUT 3 min? Come on, anyone can endure 3 min bouts of cardio followed by weights. I have to agree that you dont feel ""the burn"" with the weights and not really sore either but you dont have to feel the burn to get muscle :) it's a great compliment to my routine. I usually do this video, the 8 min video of whatever muscle I am doing that day, my 5-day ab video from ""The Firm"" and a 15 min stretch video rounding out my workout at about 60min. On my ""off days"" I walk 3 miles.It's a gtreat video if you want to feel like you are moving quick and want a little bit of everything! If you want a weight training video I recommend looking somewhere else..."
4,"Fun Workout, Motivating Instructor","Fifty minutes flies by with this workout because of all the variety. In addition to the targeted toning sections, each cardio interval has a different theme: classic aerobics, ""ball games"", dancing, kickboxing, bootcamp, and power yoga. The yoga doesn't really get your heart rate up, but it's in the last circuit so I think of it as the prelude to the cool-down. As always, Chris is excited, inspiring, and genuine."
1,waste of money,"What a complete and total waste of time and money. I bought this because I am Filipina and I wanted a way to teach my nieces, nephews, and grandchildren how to do it. Nowhere in the description does it say that this is modified from the traditional to an American style. It was totally useless for the purpose I had in mind. Now, if you are looking for a simple way to do a fun, new exercise for kids that is totally western, this may be a good bet for you. If you wanted real tinikling, it's not even close."
4,Great compilation.,"A great compilation of prominent and varied 80s and 90s country. Such a diverse group represented - from my personal faves Little Texas' My Love to Paul Brandt's I Do (best tracks on the album). Take a listen to the rarely played Can I Trust You With My Heart? by Travis Tritt. A few tracks are skippable, including the overplayed Shoes You're Wearing by Clint Black... but overall, a great investment."
2,Avoid refurbished batteries,My cell phone rejected the refurbished battery for this model. You are taking chances to order this. Refunds or replacements can be difficult to claim under the seller's guarantees.
2,A poor book for such an interesting subject,"I bought this book expecting to find well written biographical data of the various U-Boat skippers who won the coveted Knights Cross but I was let down by the poor presentation of the subject. The photos are not always from the captains wartime carrer, the text is very short (one or half page for every individual) and the only useful aspect of the book is the trivial data, like date of birth, date of awards, promotions etc.U-Boat aces deserve a better book."
5,Best in series,"Our sons enjoy many of Maurice Pledger's books -- and this one with AJ Wood is our favorite for its well written text to accompany the drawings. some of the other books have much weaker text, and some have animals that do not look all that different (the mammals are often very similar). This is a nice story where the little dolphin looks for his family, all the while watched over by his mother."
2,Still waters run deep -- this is white water,"If you loved the mature sound of ""All The Pain Money Can Buy,"" you may be disgusted by this one. Pop nonsense is right. If I wanted to listen to meaningless pop I'd just turn on the radio and not waste my dollars. Everything is overdone, the sound is very ""thick"" with many layered rock instruments, and the lyrics are what you'd expect out of Britney Spears -- not the Fastball we knew from the previous CD. There's no soul to this CD (and I'm talking about the thing, not the music style). I hope that this album is largely a case of fulfilling a record contract in any way they can, and that the next things we see from Fastball are a return to the depth and maturity of All The Pain instead of this pop pap. I agree with the reviewer who says this album is ""playing it safe."""
1,Retro? Please! Let's Try .....,"I'm sorry, but I enjoyed the tunes I heard on the radio from their first album much more that this one. This album runs the ..... gamut from XTC & Squeeze to Oasis to the Beatles with little original input of their own. The only redemption at all is the Bill Preston piano jam on ""You're An Ocean"". The hook is good too, but I'm glad I bought this as gift for someone else. I can't say I'd have it in my collection. I would give it a zero, but the review form check boxes will not allow it."
2,Fastball plays it safe,"Pleasant, pop nonsense. Nothing like the previous groundbreaking album. The cool genre-bending stuff like ""Way"" is nowhere to be found here. It's not bad, but we know they're capable of better. Hopefully this album's lack of success will push them back out of their safe zone for their next one. I'm still a fan, but feeling a little let down."
4,If there was any justice.....,"....this would be a #1 album. In a time in which the airwaves are flooded with rap/metal hybrids and pseudo R&B, it is refreshing to hear a great pop album like ""The Harsh Light of Day"". This should please anyone who ejoyed their last effort, and anyone who enjoys a great, melodic guitar song with a catchy hook. ""You're an Ocean"", the first single, is an infectuous tune that you'll be singing all day long after one listen."
5,They have finally returned!,"Fastball has to be one of the best rock bands out there; the great styles of guitar, percussion, bass, and guest players on this cd make it one of the best ones i have in my collection. Their first single You're An Ocean is a great radio song, and will get many people to notice them, if they have been living in a cave for the past few years. If you didn't buy the first cd, and you like their song The Way, buy it; I garuntee that you will love every single song on it. That's why i bought this cd from only hearing one song on it; i did it last time and it worked out for me! but before you buy this one get the first one first; make sure that you like this wonderful band before you get this cd. This has got many great songs on it, and hopefully Fastball will continue to rock on."
3,schizo progress,"Building on the musical precedents set by their commercial breakthrough album All the Pain Money Can Buy, Fastball has created a fairly engaging album in The Harsh Light of Day. The music ranges from retro power pop (You're An Ocean, which benefits greatly from the keyboard talents of Billy Preston) to harder fare (Time), all wrapped up in a Beatles-esque feel.However, the album seemed to suffer from a lack of direction. The contrasting styles of some songs don't seem to allow the album as a whole to take on any particular personality. Nonetheless, Fastball does a good job of making you want to hear more."
4,Very good CD,"I read a couple reviews and it says its inconsistant. I beg to difffer.What a great album and with Gusters album and David Grays CD, this has restored my faith in the often boring and overpriced laden Music Business. I havent bough a CD in a long time that is both creative and catchy to sing to. Id love to see these guys live now. Check this one out"
3,"not bad in general, but not many points","This book is worth reading, but there is only one idea ""PPP"" which isn't unique at all. The writing is good and there are some interesting example. What i can say is, it didn't waste my time."
5,Imagination's Light,"This is a beautiful piano album. Kevin Kern composes beautiful music that touches the heart and heals the soul. I recommend this album to anyone who loves soft, easy listening piano music."
5,Imagination's Light,"This CD is perfect for listening and thinking, listening and dreaming, listening and, well, just plain listening. The melodies are easy to like and beautifully played. It's a CD I would recommend and that I give as a gift when I can."
5,Imagination's Light,"This cd is a beautiful addition to any music collection. Kevin Kern isone of the best pianists of our time, and his haunting, and relaxingmusic, will take you to peaceful places, and care free lands."
5,excellent OST,"I fyou like ""space like music"" you will surely love this one! Loved the movie, love the ost.----------- ------------- -------- ------ ----- ---- ------ -"
5,excellent percussion,"Martinez is a great percussionist and it shows on his lastest work. If you liked the Traffic soundtrack, you'll probably like this. I enjoyed the music from the movie. It added another enjoyable element to the production, almost like another actor or a really good piece of set design.Hey Amazon[.com], post a track listing!"
5,The best part of a great movie,"Cliff Martinez's score for the 2002 release Solaris is one of the most moving soundtracks I can think of ever having heard. The music is quite well suited to meditation, reflection, prayer, and rest. Having just obtained it, I was able to use the music one evening during my time of prayer to enhance the experience. Nothing mystical or anything, just a hightened sense of what I was doing.At any rate, as a fan of Yanni, Secret Garden, Mike Oldfeld, and other non-traditional musicians, I found this soundtrack to be a gorgeous listen, and I highly recommend it."
1,"""Buzzed"" Out","I rushed to buy the soundtrack the first time I saw the movie, the music is that good. Right out of the wrapper, every other track has in-the-recording distortion as though the input recording signal is saturating, or the sound of blown speakers. Same at all volumes. Nothing wrong w/ my system I guarantee. Too bad!"
2,Not much to work with,"There is really only one track worth it's salt here, and that's Track #2 (First Sleep). The rest of the tracks on this disk fall into one of two categories. The first are just tired, pared-down versions of track #2. The others are bla, movie-filler background ambience. Much of the sound is out of context when not in the movie, i'm sure. It's very bland and unimaginative. Most of my musical taste falls in the ""ambient"" category. There are many other comments here about how it sounds ""spritual"" or ""soothing"". If you like this kind of music, you should check out something that's actually interesting like Ian Boddy's ""Aurora"", Stars of the Lid, or music by Steve Roach, Robert Rich, or Vidna Obmana (particularly ""Crossing The Trail""). This piece of work is pretty flat (except track 2). I'm sure it's decent when you watch the movie, but rather disappointing as an album. It even fails as background music. I would not recommend it."
3,Looking for the song...,Hello.. would anyone by chance know who wrote or performed the song heard on the trailer to this movie???
4,Great Gift,The Krinkels ornaments are all very cute and whimsical = a little on the large size but light enough to hang on a tree.
3,this game is okay,This game has good graphics and sound but it is hard to control and play. overall it's okay.
1,Not worth the effort it takes to click the 'purchase' button,"OK, where to begin..... The gameplay is that of a fighting game......which would be good- except for the fact that this is a wrestling game! The roster is deep.....which makes it fun to pound on the Nitro girls like Big Poppa Pump pounds them off-screen."
5,Only If Your a Wrestling Fan,This game is the sequal to Nitro. This game is only for a wrestling fan. If you want to get a wrestling game for the PSX pick up WWF Warzone. Thunder is more like a fighting game then wrestling. Each guys have the same moves except each have 3 special moves. When you get the hidden guys they don't even have there own special moves they take somebody elses. For example when you get Rey Mistero he has none of his moves.
2,Don't count on it,The game is ok but the the feeling in the ring is too small and when you move a superstars place it should play the groups music.The rings are too boring should be a NITRO ring.Cage matches should be in ring chosen.
4,The truth is.........,"That TRUTH has released a stellar second release. ""Ready Now"" is a great follow up and more well rounded album then the over produced debut she released 2 years ago. Raphael Saadiq is at the helm of this cd.""Knock Knock"" is the lead off single and rightfully so as it is well crafted for TRUTH'S voice and the hypnotic lyric (""always at my door...Knock Knock) is catchy for the casual listener. Other standouts include the title track, the hummer banger ""Ride"", the slow jam ""Catch 22"" and the seven mintue ""U"" which ends this albumBetter writing and production have served her well this time. This should spawn more than 1 hit. Hopefully the label and public are aware this time around."
1,Not Feelin' It,There are only 2 good songs on this CD; #9-Lifetime and #11-U. This is a very bad sophomore attempt. Her first album was the BOMB! She should have stuck with Dr. Dre.
2,Season set coming -- avoid this,"Considered by many fans to be the best season ever, Survivor: The Australian Outback - The Complete Second Season is being released April 26, 2005. This brief review of the season is ok, but the season set is definitely the better buy. The season set is six discs, one of them being this disc. DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOU ARE BUYING THE SEASON SET."
2,Rent it instead,"The DVD is good for those who didn't follow the show when it was on, as it gives a good summary of the series as a whole. However, for those who followed it, as I did, the DVD was quite a disappointment. It just seemed as though they showed a couple of extra minutes of what was already seen on TV. There were little ""outrageous moments"" on the DVD. What was nice, though, were the Tribal Councils, in which each contestant's 'confessions' on camera were shown, instead of only a few seconds of it. Also included are excerpts from each contestant's audition tape and interview, which are quite entertainig. However, overall, the DVD was a disappointment and added very little to what was already shown."
3,"I expected more, but not bad.","As a big fan of the show I was very excited to add this to my DVD collection. I was happy with Volume 1 and was expecting the same with this DVD, but I was rather disappointed. The 2nd season of Survivor in my opinion has been the best of all 4. I just wish this DVD would have included more than it did. It's not as long as Volume 1, and does not include any material that was not on TV. They could have done better with this DVD. This collection is for diehard fans like myself only. Rudy still rules."
1,no challenges,"I saw this series and I think its completly boring, and diferent than the tv series, they barely put the fun parts, like all the challenges, for rewards and inmunity, I think that they made this video, more seing the personalities of the people than the fun and excitement of the real adventure of surviving. I dont recommend anyone to buy it, and to the producers I tell them to put more action and not that many boring stuff like all the tribal councils, they should put the whole series even if it takes them more than one disc."
1,122 minutes ONLY?!,"I thought it would be the whole season of Survivor 2, who wants only 122 minutes of high-lights from the show?!"
2,I survived this tape,"It was an ""ok"" viewing--I was expecting more outrageous events or happenings. It seemed more or less a review, which is fine, but I was expecting more things that I didn't see on tv. They went into the Kimmi and Alicia fight more in depth, which was ok, but again, we saw it on tv (without the cursing). Maybe I expected more going into it, but it was a bit of a let down."
2,Wake up CBS,"I hope CBS wakes up for survivor 3 and makes a real dvd for the season at the end....or are they just lazy? We want COMPLETE episodes! Not this fast re-hash stuff. No one likes this chopped down garbage, we want DVD's brimming full of new features that we can watch for hours. Please, make it right with S3, and do something good for a change. We are sick of these bad dvds from S1 and now S2."
2,May as well just buy the whole season box set.,"This DVD contains uncensored and unedited moments from Season 2, a very good season, and is a must-have for any Survivor fan. But skip on this purchase. If you're a die-hard enough Survivor fan, just buySurvivor - The Australian Outback: The Complete Second Seasonfor not even $10 more, and it includes this entire DVD as a bonus disc."
1,"If You Really Liked Survivor 2, You WONT Like This","I really enjoyed both Survivor 1 and 2, and have purchased both DVD's. While very disappointed with the first DVD, I purchased the second DVD in hopes that there would be some improvement. Unfortunately, it is worse than the first DVD. Where the producers of the DVD could have taken a full two hours to tell the story of Survivor 2, they instead chose to really show clips of the survivors, followed by audition footage. For someone who has never seen the show, the DVD will seem incoherent and impossible to follow. For example, there is no insight given as to why anyone votes the way they do, all we see are five people voting a particular way. There is no mention of any tie votes or strategies going on. All of the suspense and drama that made Survivor so enjoyable is lost. I can only hope that the third time will be the charm on making Survivor DVD's."
1,BADLY edited! Not what you expect,"I am a big Survivor fan and I was disappointed before I even put this DVD in the player. Right on the insert it tells you in what order the Survivors are voted off. It is not like the TV show at all in fact I feel like this DVD is just the unlicensed footage. There is no continuity, no tribal counsel, only meet this person...vote them off. Does anyone know where I can see early seasons of Survivor? I want to see how the game has evolved."
3,Nice review,"This was a nice review of Survivor 2 in a two hour period. It pretty much summarizes the basic plot of the show, and shows the voting at every tribal council. However, it does not seem to go into too much detail on many of the challenges. It would have been nicer if this would have been longer and more detailed. Also, I do not recommend this for anyone who did not see the actual show."
2,Season One DVD Much Better,"This DVD was well produced, but lacked almost anything new. Nice if you want a recap of the second Survivor series, not very interesting if your memory exceeds that of a goldfish. Lacks special features and additional information one would expect."
4,Kept Me Dancing If Only For A While,"Onka's Big Moka is a bit of a mixed bag really. There are stand out tracks like Dancing In The Monnlight and Achilles Heel, and there are single contenders like Only For A While and Breathe but the album goes down hill from then. I do own this cd and im glad that i bought it but its not the best album in the world. I would recommend that you listen to this album before this album and you will instantly know if you will like it or not"
4,"Good, but slightly dated","This video is a good look at what Air Force One is all about. It is a little dated in some areas, but the information is still very interesting."
5,A definite must for any martial arts instructors library.,"As a long time reader of martial arts books on styles and techniques I would very heartily recommend Dr.Yang's book. It is a very instructive and concise manual presented in a clear and easily interpreted format. Unlike many other martial arts texts, the various techniques are clearly photographed and diagramed with precise instruction to complete each technique successfully in any situation. Begining students as well as long time practitioners can benifit from Dr.Yang's knowledge and expertise"
5,A Text Book on Shaolin Chin Na,"I am continually referencing back to my Dr. Ming Books, and DVD's, this one however is one of my favorites. Easy to read and understand, Good pictures, and I always seem to find something new. It truly is a must have for a martial arts library, or for anyone who is curious about joints, pressure points, health and healing, as well as self defense techniques revolving around the seizing of your enemy. I strongly recommend this book for the serious martial artist, including the one without a teacher."
2,not much of use here,"this book was a let downdon't but this book, what is in this book is mostly unworkableagain pass on this book save your money and get something else"
2,not good for every type,"All forms can be applied only by the movement of some types of internal kungfu familiar to auther ONLY. Kungfu studens who practice other kind of kungfu such as external martial arts may see no chance to use them or find them useless.THe book is only good for Tai Chi or Pa kwa. If you practice Shaolin line of kungfu, look for other books."
5,Great Shoes!,"I was skeptical even after reading the reviews. However, these are indeed the best and most comfortable pair of shoes I own. I plan to buy them in black also!"
2,Disappointing,"While this video may be touted as having a lot of nudity and mildly kinky sex, in fact most of the carnal stuff is compressed into a few jump-cut moments early in the video. Afterwards, we're treated to an its-been-done-before-and-better story of a husband descending into obsessive madness over his wife's imagined infidelity. I'll be honest: I didn't get this for all the voice-over yammering on the part of the husband as he goes on and on and on."
4,Good Product. A little out of date though.,"The product works well for me, but is alittle out of date as expected with print maps, butit is the newest one and for the price it is great!"
2,Long and drawn out,"Good principles, although very basic. Authors reinterate the same points for an entire chapter and the exercises they want you to do are more phony than super beneficial (in my opinion)."
2,Not much beef,"This book does not contain any more than the managed extensions specification document that ships with Visual Studio.net. It covers the most straight forward concepts with most straight forward and trivial examples.I would have liked to see tougher topics covered like how to do callbacks from managed to unmanaged C++. Also more samples on interop between C#, MC++ and native C++."
4,An old friend delivers a solid first novel.,"Clyde Linsley has written a highly entertaining first novel, a tasty little tale best devoured in one or two sittings so you can concentrate on the trail of clues followed by youthful private eye Leo McFarlin. With only about 210 pages to work with, Linsley fashions a fully developed character in McFarlin, a young man working on his third career and with a special reason to empathize with teenage figure skater Debbie Liston, the target of death threats if she does not give up competitive skating. Hired to protect Debbie by her mother, once a highly promising young skater herself, McFarlin soon finds himself in more danger than his client. I must confess to having more than an impartial interest in this book: Clyde Linsley is a longtime friend and former colleague at the Hartford Times. So I certainly want ""Death Spiral"" to be successful. And I'm happy to say that, after reading it, I can recommend it with a clear conscience. Way to go, Clyde!"
2,Find another video,"I'm not Muslim, and don't know as much about Islam as other reviews seem to. What I do know is that this is not a very interesting video. I got it to use with 6th graders studying the origins of Islam. I found only about a 7 minute segment which was usable in a classroom setting. The rest was very tedious and just plain boring. (I usually show 15-25 minutes of documentary video, which is all that holds their attention at that age. But it was hard to get then to sit through just 7 minutes of this.) I got rid of it after using it one year, and have ordered a PBS video on Islam which will hopefully work out better."
2,dated video,"I had flashbacks of school where the teacher would turn the lights out, the reels would start spinning and you know you're just minutes away from dreamland. This video was made in the 70s and although it was probably pretty good at the time...it definetly looks dated! I think the info is probably still accurate, but it didn't keep my attention...I still haven't finished it?!"
1,Film with erroneous facts to tarnish Islam,"This is not recommended to anybody wants to know the true history of Islam with an open mind. Prophet Mohammed was an illeterate which is endorsed by all the historical facts - there is no contradiction about this. There is no way that he read the bible or anyother holy book as he was illiterate. This is a propaganda film to tarnish Islam, the only true religion of God, through media. God will surely punish whoever tarnish a true religion with all the misleading facts."
3,Intro to Muslim history,The video does make a mistake in caying that Muhammad learnt religion from christians and jews. It does go into history of islam and the caliphates. A good intro to the topic.
1,JoJo Reardon needs to shut up,"Wow, that insane review by JoJo Reardon was really out of line, huh? Not only that, but it's all LIES. Liberty did NOT bomb. It sold millions all over the globe. Just buy this album. The sales speak for themselves."
3,Not that bad..but..,"Well i love duran duran but i think that only some songs are good and the rest especially the b side of the disc it sucks..No more inspiration..It needs remastering and it is recommended only for the die-hard funs.Violence of Summer,Serious, my antarctica,first impression are good songs but the whole album for the group's standards isn't..6/10"
5,A Great Album,"Probably the most least known of all the Duran albums and one that is either a love-it or hate-it, but in my humble opinion is quite good.It can be dark at times and true does lack direction in certain areas, but it felt lyrically & musically more honest and pioneering than any of their other albums until that time. This was also the album that Warren was considered a full member (along with Sterling Campbell) and had put another element into the mix.If you are looking for the Duran you know it is reachable in such tracks as ""Violence of Summer"" and ""Serious"". If you are willing to keep a open mind: ""First Impression"" & ""Downtown"" are musts (and my personal favs from this album).Overall I give this album 4 1/2 stars. I know I have five (the four makes it look like you should pass it up).It is not a perfect album such as ""Rio"" due a lack of a true flow from one song to the next (or a true theme) but it is a great listening experience."
4,Not as bad as everyone thinks!,"This album is not as bad as everyone thinks it is. It has some great songs and some not so great songs. I think that it suffered from the musical change of the 90's. I think Violence of Summer is an awesome song as is Serious. If you are a D2 fan then you have this album. If you are not a D2 fan you would not be reading this review. IF you are just getting into D2 then I would highly recommend Rio and Duran Duran and the earlier music first, but also buy this one. I would certainly buy this one before Medazzaland and Poptrash."
3,Diamonds Are Forever,"All That Glitters Is Not Gold, but I consider this album under-rated. I consider it almost as atmospheric as Duran's Arcadia project So Red The Rose - it is very moody, but in a very different way to Seven And The Ragged Tiger. I recommend this album for three tracks - Serious, Hothead [Evolution] and My Antarctica. They are brilliant. As for the rest, well at least they are listenable to and original songs, unlike many on Thank You, Medazzaland or Pop Trash. It seems to be the recent trend of Duran Duran to release albums with three darn good songs. Sadly, the rest seem to be almost an afterthought of unexciting self-indulgence"
2,The most disappointing Duran Duran album.,"In danger of fading into obscurity at the end of the 80's, Duran Duran re-invented themselves as a funk-rock act for Liberty. Unfortunately the album wasn't the comeback they had hoped for, and it is easy to see why. Liberty is full of mediocre songs you won't want to listen to again, ruining the few high points, such as the catchy ""Violence of Summer"" and the beautiful ballad ""My Antarctica"". Thankfully the band learned from their mistake and went on to write the excellent Wedding Album."
4,"fantastic...a bit over-produced, but fanfreakintastic","""Liberty""...wow, what can I say about ""Liberty""...from ""All Along the Water"" to ""Serious"" to ""My Antarctica"", a delicious album full of the hints of the dynamic and well-varied band that would later go on to record ""Medazzaland"". It's a bit overstyled in the hands of Chris Kimsey, a bit overpolished, but well worth the buy."
2,Die-hard fan disappointed.,"As a die-hard Duran Duran fanatic, I'm sorry to say that this album was quite disappointing. First of all, the production is horrible and production has been one of their strong points. It has a few nice moments - ""My Antartica"" being the stand out song. The single ""Violence of Summer"" is very very forgettable. This album is officially the beginning of DD's inconsistent output. The line up changes as well as changes in musical direction have steered the boys in the wrong direction. I bought is because I'm a loyal fan and hoped they would do better."
2,Not a very interesting album.,"I've always been a fan of Duran Duran, but to be honest, this is one of their albums I don't much care for. I used to feel the same way towards their other album Big Thing, but I've gotten to where I respect that one more than Liberty. Almost all of the songs on Liberty are basically unmemorable and forgettable. The only songs that are pretty good are ""Serious"" and ""My Antarctica."" I happen to think that ""Serious"" is the best song off of this collection. The guys seemed to be in a stage of transition on this album: the use of guitars was more up front and noticeable than past albums for example (which isn't bad). The songwriting is just not that strong on here--everything else (musicianship and production) about Liberty is okay. This isn't a completely poor effort, but it's not that good either."
2,Reaching,"Duran Duran had a few new members, and appeared to be reaching for a new sound. They probably should have waited a bit. This album caused many (including myself) to prematurely write the band off - the fact that it came out right after a greatest-hits disc didn't help matters. It took me a while to grow to like some of the tracks on here - ""My Antarctica"" is one of the prettiest songs the band has ever done, while ""Serious"" is a great mid-tempo number. ""First Impression"" is fairly good (although that wasn't MY first impression!), and ""Violence of Summer"" is a passable track. I'd suggest this one to completists, or to anyone who finds it for under a few bucks."
3,Too over-produced,"This album is not that bad, however, it is quite overproduced. Also, the wrong songs were released as singles. The first single should have been ""All Along the Water"", then ""Read My Lips"", then ""Violence of Summer"" and finally ""Hothead"". ""All Along the Water"" could have been a huge dance track if it had been released. The album as a whole is a bit too much to swallow on the first listen. It really does grow on you the more you listen to it. 1990 was also an unusual time for music. Vanilla Ice, MC Hammer, Milli Vanilli and New Kids on the Block were the hottest things at the time. Comercially, the album was doomed from the get go."
4,"a good album, not a bad album","OK, who in the world thinks this is duran's worst album?""seven and the ragged tiger"" is there worst, period.""liberty"" got blown up by the states!, some reviewing it as a rap album! HOW?only one hit single, ""violence of summer"", which is a weak single, but excellent tracks from 2-7, including ""serious"", maybe there best? the later part of the album is Very different after ""read my lips"", not to say t's bad, but a big change in sound and is hard to listen to in a entire siting.listen to this a dozen times and you will like it more han just OK."
4,after 18 year liberty will set you free,"VOSa good story funky number great groove Si y the boys having good laugh.Simon sings with lot of soul and the boy get down and funky.libertyThis one is marvin gay. Just pure beautiful let yourself go and groove infectious piano melody simon croons above the graceful groove change your mind and get out the dance floor.HotheadIs this D2??? check...a guerrilla rap groove and experiment in the rock rap world of chili peps.Seriousa Seriously beautiful number one of the best D2 tracks everAll along the watergreat sexy dance number1st impressiongreat rock n roll track warren c lets it ripread my lipsthink prince funk with a bit of r n rcan u deal w itstraight up rock n fun great departure from early D2venice drowingthe most experimental and cool d2 trackDowntownis this d2? a rocking groove, taking downtown.."
2,The price of Liberty,"I am a Duran Duran fan. I was deceive with Liberty. With this album, I thought that Duran Duran was at the end of the road. Yes, there is some catchy tunes but, besides ""Violence of Summer"" and ""Serious"", there was no serious contender here. Hiring Chris Kimsey for producer was kind of a bad idea. Fortunately, the following CD, 1993's Wedding Album, was superior product. Liberty is for die-hard Durannies only.And unlike reviewer ""They can ban me"" said, Liberty didn't sold millions of copies. It didn't even reach gold status in the US."
2,Even the artwork is bad.,"Has two of the coolest Duran songs ever---""Violence of Summer,"" and the title track. ""Serious"" isn't half-bad either. The rest is complete dreck. And while I'm sure the orange color scheme probably SOUNDED good....."
1,"Get Serious, this was they're weakest album!","If you like noisy samples and guitar rifts thrown in with some blunt lyrics, this is the album for you. Songs like ""Venice Drownig"" and ""Downtown"", could NEVER win over any new or old fans.I love Duran Duran, and I hate to bad-mouth them, but the only great song here is ""Serious"". I suggest ANY Duran album but this one!!"
3,In Their Own Words,"Nick Rhodes: ""'Liberty' was written by the band that played together on the `Big Thing' tour. It was five people; it included the drummer, too [Sterling Campbell].""John Taylor: ""For me the key to `Liberty' was, `We gotta be a five-piece band again, guys! We gotta be a five-piece...' I mean, how inane. What an inane idea.""Simon LeBon: ""The album was slightly overproduced, but there were some moments. I still think that Violence of Summer is a great song. We really did get the girls in the blonde wigs before anybody else did, thank you very much!"""
3,Average Duran effort,"Not the greatest, but not the worst either. The best song here is ""Serious"", which is very catchy if you give it a chance. Follows the Standard Duran Formula of 4 stanzas, the ""mid"", and then a few more stanzas."
4,Another Good One,This is just another great album from The Black Keys. This album has some more addictive beats and style.
5,"Awesome CD, Incredible LIVE!","Just like many TBK fans, I've been waiting for their third release, ""Rubber Factory."" This one, just like their others, does not disappoint.As awesome as TBK's studio recordings are, they're no comparison to their live shows. The limited edition of RF came with a bonus DVD. I hope you can still get your hands on a copy of ""Live in Austin, TX,"" 'cause it's killer!Enjoy the music, enjoy the videos. They're both worth it."
3,good stuff,"while the music isn't exactly groundbreaking, it makes you want to nod your head and has a real bluesy feel that is refreshing today. Wait, i better take that back because some people think that because this band has been called a blues band when they're not that it means they are terrible. Review the music instead of criticising them just because you don't think it's blues music. I love the fuzzed out punky guitar on this album and ""the lengths"" is a nice change up. Overall i think it's a good album, except i found that the sound got a bit grating after a while."
5,Soundtrack for driving to the pub,"I liked this album on the first listen. After the second, I was planning to pick up a copy on the way to the pub. By the fourth it found a place in my daily rotation.The album lands under the genre ""Garage Rock Revival"" which houses notables such as The White Stripes, The Vines and And You Will Know Us By the Trail of Dead. Comparison: first album Black Crowes (i.e. shake your money maker) mixed with third album White Stripes (i.e. white blood cells), with more natural blues sensitivity thrown in and you'd have a smoothy that tasted much like this album sounds; refreshing.(from http://www.eternalplay.com/blogs/music/)"
4,"Keys, please!","The Black Keys soulfully lament their hard knocks and play mean guitar licks that are catchy and laid back enough to cozy up to until the songs touch on some disturbing darkness. Each of their albums explores different aspects of the blues-rock genre and they'll all get you throbbing. Although the album Attack and Release has a trip-hop under current à la Portishead and Cut Chemist, The Black Keys thump right on through the flourishes. The album Magic Potion gives a nod to Black Sabbath's self-titled album. The album Rubber Factory has hooks a plenty and its share of naughty thoughts. Looking forward to seeing them live."
3,Churning out bounce,"Still a hazily good indie-blues time, some of the gritty authenticity and engaging, fuzzed out simplicities which made the band initially embraced start sounding routine here, beginning to run out of steam with a decidedly limited sonic palate."
4,"good beat , easy to exercise to","Listen to the Black Keys to energize yourself for exercise. I come from Youngstown, OH and this is the kind of music that reflects the Rock and Roll soul of Northeastern Ohio.GO BUCKS"
3,"OK, for white boys","These guys do an ok job of aping the North Mississippi hill country blues with a rock twist. But make no mistake about it, these are rock musicians attempting to create a blues fusion sound. It sounds like they caught R.L. Burnside on Letterman or something back in '01 and said, ""hey, let's do that!"" Do yourself a favor and get some R.L., Junior Kimbrough or some Cedell Davis. After you hear the real deal, you'll throw rocks at the boys from Akron. It's a shame R.L. had to wait 30 some years for his due. They should give R.L. a cut of everything they sell, but they don't even give any of those guys their props in any of their liner notes."
2,Yawn...,"Contrary to popular thought the Black Keys do in fact not rock. In fact they are quite boring. Akron, Ohio was once the home of Devo and the Rubber City Rebels. Good stuff that had gusto and energy. Albeit a long time ago. This is flat, ""young white guy trying to sound like an old weathered black guy"" blues. I'm insulted I ever listened to the reviews.To rock you have to put forth some passion and some kind of drive. This has none of that. And hooks? None to be found. The lyrics are quite simple. Woe is me...my girl is gone. But I got no sympathy here."
1,SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO LAME!!!!! AND THEY ARE OPENING FOR RADIOHEAD!!!,"WHY?!?!?!?! WHY MUST THIS LAME WHITE KID BLUES JUNK EXIST?GO BUY A STEVIE RAY VAUGHN RECORD!IS THIS S**T ACTUALLY HIP?!?!?!?!GET A LIFE!!!!GO BUY A SOUTHERN ROCK ALBUM FROM THE 70'S, NOT THIS FAKE, TRITE, B.S.!!!LAME!LAME!LAME!WHITES STRIPES ARE NOT MUCH BETTER!GO BUY A ZEPPELIN RECORD KIDS!GET A LIFE!"
4,Bluesy garage rock with a punch,"Imagine the Rolling Stones up to and including Let It Bleed mixed with the White Stripes but with a soulfull lead singer that channels late sixties, early seventies rock vocal stylings. Now add some fuzzed out bluesy guitar and slide and you'd have an approximation of the Black Keys' sound. They have just the right amount of ""slop"" to their sound, ie any more and they would stink, any less and they wouldn't be as charming. But really the best thing about these guys is the songwriting which is emotional and melodic with a good amount of bluesy grit and feel. This is rock before it was called ""classic"". The only thing that mars the cd is the crappy, er, ""lo-fi"" recording, but what do you want from two guys from Ohio who recorded in a rubber factory? This is the first recording I've heard by these guys and I'm convinced, good stuff."
5,Amazing........Album....absolutely.....great....,"1. if this doesnt tell you whats wrong with commercial music today. This is a fantastic album, with no airplay....I just dont get it...does everything have to be rechewed bubble gum music to be played on radio......do youself a favor.....clear the palate....try this album.......better then a sinus enema...and easier to swollow."
4,kick butt-tunes,"I just got this cd 2 weeks ago and I love it, its great, its justwhat I was looking for, didnt know them never heard of them butnow I will be getting thier other cds.You have rock and roll andyou have blues and this is a kick [...] cd, there voice's are notgreat but niether is joe cocker's, if you want to get loose andburn some rubber off your shoes than buy this cd. Song for songits really good,I cant wait to get the next one."
4,"Vulgar, crude, profane, tasteless...","...and funny! Everything you love about South Park. The single player mode is unique and exciting. How many other games are there where you can get attacked by aliens, turkeys, and toys? But the multi-player mode is even better.

4,This game rules!!!!!!!!!!!,This game is cool but it gets old after awhile. Show lovers this is the game for you. But any one else just rent it.
2,Worst game I've ever played...,"I only gave this game 2 stars because if you're die-hard South Park fan, it's possible that you might enjoy this game... but I like South Park, and I HATED it. The controls are IMPOSSIBLE to use (you have to use the C buttons most of the time), the gameplay is repetitive and boring (all you do is walk around throwing snowballs at turkeys), and the multiplayer part is boring too. One pro is that the guns are pretty original & the South Park kids say some funny things, but the novelty wears off after a while. I bought this game when it first came out, for ..., and I sold it for $5 at a stoop sale... I just wanted to get rid of it, it's really that bad. If you really have to get it, at least rent it first."
1,This toy isn't worthy of the N64.,All of the profanity makes it so much not fun. Especially if your friends aren't allowed to hear it! Even in the show (Which I watch on a regularly bases) doesn't come anywhere near the amount of cussing this game has in any one episode.
1,Misuse of a great license,"Making South Park into a first person shooter isn't a horrible idea, it's just horribly executed. I imagine Acclaim bid on the South Park contract so quickly, they didn't bother to come up with any good gaming ideas it could go with. I would also be hard pressed to do so. ..."
2,Not So Good,This Game Isn't Very Exciting.I Don't Like This Game.It's Boring .What You Do In This Game Is Try To Go Through Boring Levels That Don't Look Very Detailed.I Warn You.You Won't Like This Game.I Warn You.Don't Pick This Up.This Game Is Really Old And Just Such A Bad Game .
1,its bad,The game was bad because they said alot of bad languge.They say lots of swears. Sometimes they fliped the bird.If you are younger than 18 maybe you should'nt get this game.Parents should look at the letter M.That means mature. If you see your children wathing this smack them on the head.(Hard!)
2,Not so good.......,"(2 and a half stars)This game is pretty lousy. I'm not really sure why I bought it, but I did. At first it may seem like a pretty cool game. The control is ok, it has a South Park feel, and the weapons are pretty creative. However, once the novelties wear off the game begins to get more and more boring. The levels become the same exact thing: run around, kill enemies, run around some more, kill even more enemies, level over. After a few sessions, you will not want to play this game any more. The multiplayer is not bad, but you'd be much better off with a game like Goldeneye 007. If you are an absolute South Park fanatic you will enjoy this game, but don't expect the enjoyment to last long. I reccomend skipping this game and picking up a game with a little replay value."
1,worst game ever,"never buy this game. the graphics are alright, but the story is so stupid. if u want to buy this game buy turok. its a mature game but they beep out the cuss words. why get it if they beep out the cuss words?"
3,Afro-Mystik - Morphology,"Afro Mystik's second album shares many of the same strengths as his first (good tribal/tropical rhythms, deep vibes, diverse influences) as well as the weaknesses (wack MCs, similar sounding songs), but it's still worthwhile. ""Follow Me"" is a sweet deep house track, brought out by the vocals, and ""Samba Del Alma"" is a Latin-flavored workout. The last track, ""Momentary Visions,"" manages a quiet grace. Worth checking out!"
3,unpleasantly surprised,"I am a huge fan of Afro-Mystik on the Om Lounge Series, but I really was not feeling their cd project as all the songs were almost indistinguishable. It was a little too much on the Afro-Latin beats for my tastes and thought they should focus more on the awesome vocals of Omega. If you are heavily into the Afro/Latin sound then this is the cd for you, but if you prefer a little more variety in a cd this may not be for you. I will say, however, the production is of high quality!JeffAtl"
5,Terrific and Unique,"What a treat this album is. It just goes to show that it has to be a Finnish group to be this unique. First of all, this album sounds like prototypical power metal to me ears. Most of the musicians have impeccable CVs and it shows, the musicianship is flawless. But not a note is wasted. The solo here and the fill over there are absolutely perfect. But the obvious standout is due to Tarja's vocals. As soon as you hear them you know that this is a professionally trained soprano....singing power metal! And we should be grateful because it works. Many of us know that many metal bands have been utilizing waify female vocals to suffuse the atmosphere with a delicate touch. Well, there is nothing of it here, because the music really rocks. And the ballads are truly sweeping in their beauty. If you manage to like the soprano vocals over the power metal behind them you'll be treated to one of the most magnificient albums in recent memory. Tremendous."
4,Not bad,"When I first listened to this, I thought it was kind of silly. But after listening to the album several more times, it started to grow on me. I guess you could describe it as power metal with a lot of keyboards and vocals by a beautiful opera singer. If that appeals to you then by all means check this out. Also, if you like this one, give their other album ""Wishmaster"" a try. You won't be disappointed."
4,Odd combination of Opera and Metal,"This CD (especially track 4) combines Opera and Heavy Metal. The Guitars are wired to digital effects to sound like harpsichords, violins, etc., and the lead singer sings mezzo-soprano operatic form. Weird. Good. Melodic. Easily accessable the first time you hear it. Substantive in content. Perhaps its most attractive attribute is the subtextual commentary the group itself makes."
4,Great CD From Nightwish,"First of all, Oceanborn is a huge step when thinking about Nightwish's debut album Angels Fall First. All the elements of folk music and ambience are forgotten, and instead Nightwish have concentrated to using Tarja Turunen's wide voice and playing pure heavy metal. Or, well, another describing term could be opera metal. Drama and a variety of melodies are used effects, but overruling all the expectations, Nightwish have used them very well. Songs are catchy, but they have a long lifetime. Also, the whole band does great work: even though they seem like another Dream Theater-wannabe band, Holopainen and Vuorinen use their instruments with patience and don't slope into unneeded tricking. So everything seem to be alright, but the album as a whole lacks a little bit of diversity, and sometimes falls into repeating itself. The songs are, however, very strong, and the album as a whole works great. Oceanborn is, so far, the most successful album of Nightwish."
4,intense and beutiful,"First off, I want to state that the band Nightwish is not just Tarja Turgen's backup band. There is some very high talent in the composing of the music in this album. Oceanborn starts slow, not very impressive--- but then song after song builds the intensity to the magnus opus in the end. If you like classical music and a little metal you will be right at home here. The drumming is spectacular, and the keyboard player adds some well placed fourishes.A very high quality piece of music, go get this right now and enjoy."
3,Mostly Great,"I myself am not much of a ballad guy I dislike the ballads on this album, pure smash mouth metal is what I like. The hardcore stand-out tracks for me is Sacrament Of Wilderness, Devil And The Deep Dark Ocean, and Pharaoh Sails To Orion. I never heard of this band until I was checking out some of the progressive metal bands here at amazon, my god am I glad I did. This band has an amazing female vocalist, at some points though she is a bit off. I actually like the male voice on the two tracks, unlike other people that has commented on how they did not like it. If you do not pick up this album you are missing a great piece of art"
2,Their worst album,"THis is Nightwish's worst album. WISHMASTER, ANGELS FALL FIRST and the most recent CENTURY CHILD are all of them much. much better than OCEANBORN.In OCEANBORN, it seems that Nightwish suddenly lost their touch for a while. THe songs sound all the same, the drumming is boring and repetitive, even Tarja's vocals are annoying at some point or another.Well, this would be my last option if I was beginning to know Nightwish."
1,ludicrous,"Here comes a Malmsteen-esque style hair metal with no emotion, no imagination and no messgae; neo-classical metal they call it, but it's merely a bunch of bored Europians having fun with their Casios and their fancy production. Don't be misled by the other reviews here. This CD is the most ridiculous piece of music I have ever held in my hands. Just have a quick look at the CD cover ""art"". This is how their music sounds: kitsch-metal at its worst."
1,Oceanbore more like!,"This would be great if Nightwish had a concert at the bottom of the ocean, or, am I wishing too much here? Crap! Avoid!"
3,Summits: Climbing the Seven Summits Solo,"This book about a quest to climb the 7 summits (highest mountain on each of 7 contingents) solo is a mixed bag. The photography is stunning, and rates this book right up there with any coffee table travelogue. This book is in large format and is indeed a coffee table type. The photography expands well beyond the typical mountaineering subjects and focuses as much on the travel and locales as it does on the mountain climbing.The mountain climbing and the text is the weak link. Perhaps it should be excused by the format, which isn't conducive to extended text. But the brevity of the text leads to problems including lack of exposition and in some cases, apparent truncation of the story.All in all, this is a book worth having, but it isn't a mountaineering read."
5,The Best Ever!,"Hey! I'm a girl and I love this game! The only one I've seen better is the new Soulcalibre for Dreamscape! I love the action, the characters are aewsome, and the moves-WOW! The Edgemaster mode is cool, because you can win more weapons for the characters while leaning more about their history. My 2 fav characters are Mitsurugi and Seigfried (sp?) anyway! The intro movie is awesome. I love the song and the shots of Mitsurugi. If you haven't played this game yet, try it! It is The Best!"
4,Welcome to the stage of history...,"Soul Edge - Circa 1996GOOD:- Gameplay is pretty balanced- Some nice unlockables- Different and interesting story for a fighter- Pretty good sound track for a fighterBAD:- Graphics looked pretty dated- Voice-Overs are not so goodIF IT FITS YOUR TASTE:- Play story mode to unlock new swords characters and costumes- Plays like Tekken, but with weapons- Medieval Theme has Ninjas and Samurais fighting Pirates and KnightsGAME ITS MOST ASSOCATED TOO:- Tekken 2- Virtual Fighter 2ADDITIONAL NOTES:- This is the first game in the Soul Caliber franchise- In the arcade this game was called Soul Blade"
4,good buy,"This eye shadow is just as it appears. No surprises. The company was slow to ship and I had to call to verify my order(on a voice mail). I never did talk to a person,just let a message. That seemed kinda strange to me."
4,16 inch curb chain,"The price for this chain was great and it arrived quickly. I was a bit disappointed that the chain i got has a spring ring and not a lobster clasp, as pictured. That still would have been ok, except that the end of the chain that is supposed to hook to the spring ring isn't wide enough to fit around the ring. It does fit around the part that actually ""springs"" into place, closing the circle (that part is thinner than the rest of the ring). I could try to pry it open to make it wider, but i'm afraid i might break it completely off the chain, then i won't be able to wear it at all. I don't really feel like going through the hassle of sending it back for an exchange, paying the postage, etc, when it didn't cost that much to begin with. I actually love the chain. This would have been a five star purchase if the clasp functioned properly! =^..^="
1,Cheap,"I thought this bracelet was going to be a good buy. In fact I thought I was getting a good deal. But of course I was wearing it and it stretched out and almost broke; now how does a bracelet like this stretch out, that only means it is shortly going to break completely."
3,too cumbersome,"While the picture quality is good (too red actually, but can be fixed with software), there are too many drawbacks to rate it above 3 stars. The battery drain is very high when in photo mode, so using high-drain regular or rechargeable batteries is essential, as regular ones die after only a couple of shots. The built-in flash isn't bright enough, so I'd only recommend it for outdoor use. Manual locking of the battery compartment where SD card is located is a hassle, as is the manual lens cover. Basically, it takes about a minute to get it ready to shoot, OK for prepared shots, but too slow if you need to catch something quickly. Does not come with a charger and rechargeable set of batteries. Also too bulky, especially since you need to carry 4 extra AA batteries, just in case. No webcam, movie mode is OK, but no sound, unlike other 4Mpixel cameras.In this case, definitely, you get what you pay for, maybe even a bit less."
3,Toshiba PDR4300 4MP Digital Camera,"I find the camera takes great photographs and easy to use. I just got this camera about a couple weeks ago and I had to call support about erasing the photo's. To my surprise they say it will be a $20.00 charge for help. Now since good money was paid for this camera and a good brand name you think they would help you. Another thing I would recommend using rechargeable batteries as they last longer and cheaper too. I did find out how to erase the photo's. It is a great camera and enjoy owning it. It is not like the old days when an answer could be given freely. You can't register the camera on the web site as it is being discontinued, and information is so old it does not help you. I give the camera high marks for quality. Support 00 in my book."
3,handy camera,this is good camera for the most part. just that at times there's a slight lag in pressing the button and the picture being taken...also the picture comes out as if you were shaking sometimes...but the 3 sec timer and other features are excellent...also great quality of pics and ease of use
3,"Inexpensive, yet Underdelivering","This is the cheapest 4 mega pixel camera you can find. For the price, it is a good value. The options will satisfy most as it includes full manual mode.For those requiring top quality, and not concerned with finding the cheapest camera, I recommend you select another camera. I was not very happy with the picture quality, the battery life ( though with rechargeables that should be okay), nor the bulk of the camera. I have chosen another camera."
4,Good digital camera,"I bought this camera I believe 3 years ago and have been satisified with it. I bought it to take on trips not wanting to hassle with 35mm cameras and film. It takes great pictures in the daylight, nightime not so much but that is common with most digital photography. The camera does drain the batteries quickly but using rechargable batteries is a must with most digital cameras...turning off the digital display during photography does help this. I am overall satisfied with this camera and am not sorry I bought it!"
4,A good dark comedy.,"""Ghost World"" was a good dark comedy. It works. The acting is good by a good cast. The stroy line and plot are good. One of the years best scriprts. Really funny. Worth seeing. The DVD's features are not anything great. I recomend this movie!7/10"
3,Good but not great,"I have a feeling this story is much better in its original form (as a comic book), and just didn't translate well into film. While attracted to the whole ""teenage misfits"" concept, I simply found the two lead characters (played by Thora Birch and Scarlet Johanssen) to be flat and uninteresting. Their sarcastic barbs and ""scathing irony"" are not all that funny, and it seems they're only being used to fill a vacuum. That may be the point, but I also thought the plot lines were way too neat and tidy for a supposedly real-life movie. A lot of the other characters were deliberately cliche and predictable, with occasionally humorous results, but again more suited to comic books than live action movies. Probably worth watching once, but don't expect to be blown away."
5,I'm hooked,"I love this movie. The sarcasm, the music, the clothes etc...I purchased cds by Memphis Minnie and Skip James because of this movie, which are both enjoyable.In a wierd way I feel like I relate to Thora Birch's character;in fact, I'm sure we all can because everyone feels like an outsider at least once in their lives."
4,quite funny,yes i admit to hating Thora Birch. the reason i watched this was because Steve Buscemi was in it and he was great in this movie. this movie is really funny and i have a question. does anyone know who played the karate dude?
2,over rated,"I heard so many raves about this movie, but I found it to be very slow. And the one thing good that Enid seemed to be doing was getting Seymour a love life with the beautiful and kindly Dana. And then Enid sabotages that by sleeping with Seymour. (Why Seymour would forgo beautiful Dana to sleep with short, dumpy and obnoxious Enid I have NO idea.) I really thought this had so many flaws, I can't recommend it at all."
1,Can't Get into It,"Although another reviewer suggested and compared this movie to other ""quirky"" comedies like Rushmore, I didn't like this movie at all but did like Rushmore very much. I have liked all 3 Wes Anderson flicks to date. But this movie just wasn't for me. I found it very slow. Very dry. Although Buscemi does a good job, I have liked him in other roles more. I think for most people this will be a real 'hit' or 'miss' movie. And for me its a 'miss'."
2,Very disappointing film,"After seeing that this movie was on Roger Ebert's top 10 of 2001 and hearing about all the other praise from various movie critics, I was really looking forward to renting Ghost World. I wish I hadn't.While it might appeal to some individuals who can relate to the awkwardness of trying to fit in with their ""conventional"" peers, I found this movie a complete bore. It is very difficult to muster up ANY interest in the main character (and the film itself) as she whines and complains to anyone and everyone about how stupid and ""un-hip"" everyone is as she proceeds to spew negativity and criticism wherever possible.I would NOT recommend this film (labeled a ""comedy"" but in the darkest way) if you truly want to care or have any empathy towards the protagonist and the characters around her."
1,Disappointing Movie,"Lots of folks seem to like this movie, however, we did not. Story is about a self-centered, self-absorbed teen age girl who never seems to be able to her connect actions with their consequences. There were a few funny lines (every one of which was in the preview) between long stretches of tedium. Save the cost of the rental and just watch the preview."
5,"""No, think about it...it's actually totally depressing.""","I am not nearly as eloquent as others who have reviewed this before me, so I will just say: this is my favorite movie. Enid's opinions on and reactions to people and situations she encountered were almost identical to mine upon viewing them. In my opinion, if you enjoyed ""Heathers"", ""Broadcast News"", and/or ""Clerks"" (...), you would really like ""Ghost World""."
5,[people] in Small towns Unite!,"As an inhabitor of my own gohst world all through high school, I adore this film. It's take on being a teen girl is refreshing, original, and true. Unlike wierd girl movies of recent (""She's All That), Thora Birch's Enid is herself through to the end. She changes for no one and shows you her wonderfully original world along the way. Anyone who doesn't like this movie enjoyed High School way too much to be sane."
5,One of the best films of the year,"This film is incredible. Thora Birch was the ultimate Enid. Thank you Terry Zwigoff and Daniel Clowes, for a great comic and great film."
2,"The most depressing ""comedy"" I've ever seen","If your an anti-social punk rocker, you might just like this movie. There were some funny scenes, but the two girls are annoying. They just walk around cussing and complaining about how terrible life is and how everybody is so stupid. Buscemi was good (a little strange) but the guy with the numchucks was the best. Unfortunately, you only see ""numchucks"" for a total of 90 seconds. I think the funniest scene was when Buscemi goes into the convenient store steaming mad and tries to knock over the food shelf. He didn't see those numchucks coming now did he? Rent it if you must see it."
2,"Overrated movie, feature free DVD","Why was this film praised? I have no idea.The only reason the DVD received 2 stars was for the colors. The colors captured are great. That has to do with the costumes and lighting.Other than that avoid purchasing this film. Don't even rent it. Watch it on cable for ""Doug"", the guy with the mullet. After he disappears turn off the TV."
2,No revelations here...,"First, my apologies to all that found some sense of ownership in these characters or their deeds. Personally I found Enid to be despondent wreck, hell bent on lambasting others for their perceived injustices (read: success). The parade of foil characters that attempted to sharply contrast her persona only reinforced my belief that not only was she clueless and without direction, but that she was simply melnacholy because she did not fit in. Her acerbic demeanor, lack of depth or any altruistic conviction only proved that she wasn't motivated by a cause or struggle. My belief is that her perpetual effort to rub popular culture the wrong way was in some way a combative response to not fitting in. On that level this work was a mild success. Just don't get confused, acting out is not high art. This piece was a prime example of both the director and the protagonist being rebels without a cause...or clue."
2,overrated...,"slightly conscious of my own alienation, i really wanted to connect with this movie. or, atleast, have a couple good cynical laughs. unfortunately, the actions and development of the characters just seemed too contrived and unexplained, giving this movie a very disjointed feeling. and then there are the subtle smacks in the face that serve to hurt the movie, like the cheesy bus scene at the end. the story simply flails its arms, trying to grasp a sense of solidarity with high-school untouchables, and fails miserably.quick and dirty description: cheesy, clunky, contrived, and painful in a bad waywhat would i rather watch? high school spanish videos, they provide more insight and understanding of people and are also more amusing.i recommend watching the trailer, you'll get all the funny parts and delve into the depths of the characters."
2,"Nothing Solid About ""Ghost World""","Ghost World is the kind of movie you love to hate, at least if you're me that is. The people I can see enjoying this movie are bitter, outcast teenagers who resemble the two main characters, and seem to be the exact audience this movie was made exclusivly for. The film chronicles the adventures of two young women who have a tendency to be sarcastic and bitter towards everything and anything. The films plot lacks any direction and the ending is worthless. The film gets 2 stars for decent acting and a few interesting segments. An alright movie to rent on a rainy night, but certainly not seeing more than once."
1,i must not be hip enough to understand this...,"Ghost World is one of the worst movies i have ever seen, i can't believe someone reviewing this movie dared compare it to rushmore. I'm so sick of stupid 'indie' kids ridiculing pop culture, and thats the whole point of this movie...worthless. And on top of the stupid plot, Thora Birch is ugly and she has cankles, and those damn combat boots certainly don't make things better. My idea of a pleasant movie going experience is not ghost world, in fact in my ideal movie, none of the actors/actresses in ghost world would be present, they'd all be dead. After watching this movie, i felt like going on a murderous rampage, thats how bad it is."
1,Worst Movie Ever,I actualy thought this was one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. It's just incredibly awful. Thora Birch has an incredibly large rear in this film too...
3,Two excellent characters...and not much else.,"I had high expectations for this movie, which the critics generally loved, and ended up very disappointed. The two lead characters are both very interesting, quirky and off-beat, and I concur with the accolades they have received. However, they were really let down by the screenplay. The story is just not very developed, and we are just left with two characters in search of a story worthy of their quirkiness. On top of that, the other main characters are basically all clichés, especially the art teacher. This is not necessarily their fault, but the screenwriter's. This is a marginal movie as far as whether you should spend your time with it. I was waiting for something interesting to make the investment of time worthwhile and it just didn't happen."
2,Comics VS Movies,"I have to say I had high hopes for Ghost World after many successful comic/graphic novel adaptation, but ended up hurt and disappointed. Don't get me wrong, they picked great actors/actresses, but the story line in the movie seemed to drag. I think the book reads faster than the pace of the movie. But I'm just a digruntled comic-geek!! Check this movie out if you're really bored and are waiting for the Spiderman movie to come out!!"
2,"Just another ""Clerks""","Hardly hilarious movie attempting to be angst-ridden ironic social satire. Steve Buscemi turned in a good performance in an unusual character for him, but all others were quite bland. The main character was nothing but a self-absorbed teenage loser, bulldozing through other peoples lives, blissfully scornful of the damage she was doing. If you liked Clerks, and many did, you'll probably like this, but, if you, like me, found that movie also to be boring and self-involved, then you won't like this one much either. ..."
1,Boring & Bitchy Hipster girls,"Two hours of torture. A slow, boring mess that should have been edited down to one hour. Total over-rated crap."
3,Ghost World,"Ghost World, I believe is a very good movie. I just guess I didn't understand it, and that's why I can't give it the points it probably deserves. To me it just seemed boring, and plotless."
1,Ghost Script,"Ok, I should say right up front that I went to high school with Dan Clowes who scripted Ghost World. I sat in the same art class that he based scenes from this movie on, so it was kind of neat to see a piece of my life up there on the screen.But the fun stopped there. While all of the actors in this film where good, the characters they portrayed were hateful, and their story was a complete bore. Clowes' misanthrope characters may carry an issue or two of Eightball, but much like the comic, they become tiresome in their perpetual cynicism and outright hopelessness.Twenty minutes into the film, people started voting with their feet. Out of loyalty to Mr. Clowes, I white-knuckled it to the bitter end as his story of teenage angst hopelessly unraveled."
1,A punishment,"There are a great deal of things that I have done which I should have been punished for. And this movie is the perfect punishment. Which seems odd, as the characters were likable. The acting wasn't terrible. In fact, things were in place to make a moving teen movie. Though the characters remain interesting throughout the movie, they don't really seem to have a plot to carry.Many could dismiss this movie as merely a teen angst-type film, but this goes much lower, much worse than almost all. Unlike others, with their cliched themes, this doesn't seem to have much of a theme, and at that it's hollow. The characters seem to blend into a patchwork of nothingness, where actions and consequences don't relate and ends in frayed tatters of what could have been. If you only cared."
5,Ghost World - Great film!,"I loved this film. It was well done in every sense. You must have an appreciation for film directors who really show life the way it is, and are not afraid of meaningful pauses where they need to be. I cannot say enough good about this film. The only thing I would change is the ending. It felt rushed and I was disappointed with the way it was done - even though it had to end this way, it could have been done with more style. Excellent film, which led me to Welcome to the Dollhouse, another probably under-rated but excellent film."
5,one of the best movies of 2001,"Yes, it's funny. Yes, it's quirky. Yes, Thora Birch and Scarlett Johanssen act their collective socks off. But the best thing about this movie is the unbelievably true way it depicts friendship. The scene with Thora Birch crying on the edge of the bed because her friend has rejected her is simply amazing. If you liked Welcome To The Dollhouse, you'll enjoy this."
4,feast for the eyes,"chagelling story, dark sense of humor, next door characters and one of the greatest visual impact I've had. Np wonder why PRADA inspired one of its latest collections on the character played by Thora Birch."
3,Trippy.,"Ghost World could have been a lot better and more special. Thora Birch is a great actress and she's good in this unique indie film but the plot and ending leaves the audience with many unanswered questions. Steve Buscemi and Scarlett Johansson also star and the late Brad Renfro. Ghost World is based on a comic book, so expect a dark comedy. Wish I liked this film more but it is just ok for me."
3,five star cast,"This film was directed by Terry Zwigoff, who, to his credit has made two very original movies. However, if I were to recommend a movie by this director it would be the haunting documentary, ""Crumb"" (also recommend Birch in American Beauty, Buscemi in Fargo, and Johansson in Lost in Translation.) Ghost World was just not that memorable, and didn't quite measure up to it's potential for me. Out of 10 I would give it about a 6."
2,Did I Miss Something? (Rent it first),"First off, I admire the acting in this movie a lot. Thora Birch and Steve Buscemi carried their roles beautifully. I'm not sure if not being familiar with the comic ""Ghost World"" affected my opinion of this movie. I like a lot of movies that are so called ""uneventful"" films. This film just didn't strike me in any particular way. It wasn't really boring, but I just didn't find it ""meaningful"". It's one of those movies that you should rent before you buy, because there's plenty of people who seem to really adore this film, and then there's ones like me that are left scratching their heads and feeling silly for not understanding what beyond the acting and some of the art direction makes this film one you want to see over and over again."
3,"Some fun, goes nowhere","This is an entertaining, professional, well-made movie on all fronts.However, it seemed only a collection of odd characters and situations that really had no cohesiveness. There wasn't really much plot, except a pair of supposedly ""hip"" high-school grads who dislike most things and most people interact with a particular nerd.That being said, it was an entertaining movie, and Steve Buscemi was great as Seymour - good enough to recommend the movie just for that. If you are a fan of Steve Buscemi, Thora Birch (who supposedly gained about 20 pounds for the role) or Scarlett Johansson, then you should like this movie.It has enough odd-ball scenes and dialog so that most people will find something good, but the search for a meaningful overall ""story"" may be elusive - thereby assuring its status as a cult favorite."
4,What to do after highschool?,"When I first saw this movie I was not overly impressed but after a second viewing I have to say that it was not the fault of the movie but mine. I wasn't paying attention to the sardonic humor or the pathos played out in Thora Birch's performance as well as Steve Bushemi's. The premise is pretty simple, two life long friends graduate and try to find their place in the world around them. Enid, (Thora Birch's) charecter pretty much is the focus and she isn't sure of anything, so she goofs off and in the interm meets Steve Bushemi through a cruel trick.I found that I kept thinking of this movie after it ended. I think alot of people fantasize about doing the exact same thing as Enid does as the film closes. Ghost World will definitley enter into your waking world and it does so with a witty florish and a memorable finish.Can you tell that I am still in the throw of the Olympics? All the ice skating fried my brain!"
4,right on....,"had to get this after seeing it in the theater last year, with the exception of the strang ending a pleasure to watch...maybe after another viewing or two itll make perfect sense.....all the actors in this one do a great job, none fall short of the mark.....check it out"
5,One of the Best of 2001,"This should make everyone's top ten list for 2001, this movie was probably less popular than memento when it hit theaters, but hopefully it will do well on DVD. Anyone who doesn't like the typical teen movie should check this one out, because it is a movie with teens but without the Dawson's Creek type plot.....A+"
4,"Cynical, But Entertaining View of Today's Teenagers","GHOST WORLD is an intelligent and somewhat subversive comedy. It's cynical tone plays like an updated version of a Billy Wilder movie. Thora Birch and Scarlett Johansson are fine in their respective roles. Some of the things that the young women do in this film are not nice, but smack of reality. Steve Buscemi was also good as a blues fan that has all but given up on love.On a side note, it was so refreshing to see different blues artists explored via Buscemi's character than the standard ""Top Ten"" in other films that make reference to blues artists. Skip James is just one of the fine blues musicians mentioned in the film.If you're looking for an intelligent movie with teenage age characters as the leads, this one is a good bet. Also, expect to hear some excerpts of some fine, underappreciated blues recordings."
2,2 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:I know tons of people who esteem Ghost World but I found that it came off as pretentious and not terribly interesting--because the film is a polarizing piece of art, I would recommend (if you want to watch the film) renting before buying."
2,Maybe I Missed The Point But...,"I really didn't care much for this movie. First off, i cant imagine it is easy to make a movie based on a Graphic Novel.I found the story to be very dull, and the main character (enid i think her name is) is extreemly annoying. The movie, to me, is set around her feeling sorry for herself, and whinning a whole lot.There are parts of the movie that i did like however. I loved all the Art Class scenes i thought those were hilarious.I give it two stars, because it wasnt the worst move i have ever seen, and like i said i did like the art class scenes."
2,This Movie is Horrible!,"It is slow, boring, and without a plot. Yes, it does look like several different episodes of a comic book were put together to make this movie. It stinks!"
2,Stupid movie,"It's about two anti-social high school girls who thinks almost everything and everyone are stupid.The movie wasn't entertaining, wasn't funny, and had no character to sympathize with. Perhaps it was made for an anti-social audience.It's not a sloppy film or badly made film. It's well made, just not my cup of tea.The only reason I didn't give it 1 star is because it managed to keep my attention until the end of the movie. I guess I kept expecting something to happen which didn't."
3,"fun, but it falters","Ghost World disappointed me. I love the comic, and I couldn't believe all of the fantastic stuff Clowes left out when transferring his work to the screen. The deadpan tone that works so well in the book falls flat on the screen, it makes the girls, who in the book are anything but, seem numb and cardboard.The set design was fantastic! What a wonderful use of color! The world evoked on the screen looked so much like the world in the comic book. I was impressed.I'm not sure I recommend this film, although I wholeheartedly recommend reading the comic book... if you like it, then I say go see the film, it's always pretty cool to see the printed page unfurling on the big screen, even if you're not thrilled by the way it turns out!"
1,WHAT?! HOW HORRIBLE CAN IT GET?!,"This movie was BOOOOOOOOORING! It is really depressing, and has this weird music in it. It is practically about this depressed woman's life. In the end, she just goes away on a bus with this old man. In the middle, she loses her friend.... pretty depressing huh? NEVER WATCH THIS MOVIE, unless you like really depressing movies!"
1,"Watch this movie, or suicide?","This movie stinks. If you like actors seemingly strung out on a bad heroine binge, then this is the movie for you. The whole time it seemed like they were all wanting to be somewhere else and were just trying to get the stupid movie done so they could get there. Not much effort, in other words.To summarize: this movie stinks."
1,So Bad!!!,"I'm not very good at writing review, but I bought this DVD because of all the stars I saw here. And this is one of the worst movie I ever saw. SO THERE IS MY 5 STARS WARNING : IT'S BORING!!!!"
2,SUCH A SHAME,"I love the Supremes ""Mary Scherrie and Susaye"", so I was so happy to get this cd sent to Australia....but alas it just sounds very dated...what a shame..... far to much reliance on electronics...where are the live real musicians that would have taken this release up to anotherlevel way beyond where it is now, so that it be considered a great release. Good to say u have it in your collection BUT.....!!!!!!!Im so sorry to have to say what I have said cause I think this lady has a great voice."
5,An incredible film with heart and a brain,"Mike Leigh is known for darker works - Grown-Ups, Vera Drake, Naked... I always thought part of his ""trick"" was using deeper, dark subjects in his films. In Happy-Go-Lucky the protagonist, Poppy (Sally Hawkins), is a fun-loving, uhm, Happy-Go-Lucky young lady surrounded by friends and her kindergarten class. As a friend of mine said, ""I've never seen somebody so happy in a film that somehow wasn't annoying"". Just like Leigh's other films, this one will stay with you forever. Leigh's magic is his ability to touch our hearts with the world - not just a dark world."
2,sappy rather than happy; slow-going rather than easy going; annoying rather than charming,"Riding off into a very slow start, this movie patters along for the most part until about the last quarter of the film when it picks up pace and the dynamic between the characters really escalates. Sally Hawkins portrayal is noteworthy but the character is slap-worthy until the very end rather than lovable. The movie ends a minute too long - had it ended a few frames before it does, it would've made a posh statement, a statement that resembles the rest of the movie, instead of falling into the romantic comedy trap of our times."
1,Ghastly!,"I couldn't watch this film past the first 20 minutes. It's that bad, folks. The main character, Poppy, is the personification of a ditsy, astonishingly irritating pill of a woman.I'm a big fan of the campy, cheesy, B-movies from the 70s. These sorts of films are so bad, that they're good. A real guilty pleasure. Happy-Go-Lucky is just plain lousy, with no redeeming qualities.Poppy is a 30-year-old teacher, who behaves like a hyperactive 6-year-old. Of course a 6-year-old is usually ridiculously cheery, as most kids that age are. But to see a 30-year old act like this, is gruesome.There still aren't that many films, where women are portrayed as commanding respect. In my humble opinion, the character of Poppy, is NOT a positive role model for young women. Unless they aspire to be empty-headed, annoying, and trite."
1,Happy-Go-Lucky Isn't,"I do not understand the 4 and 5 star reviews for this movie. Don't waste your money or your time. This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The lead character, Poppy, is 30 years old and acts likes she's 3 years old. The character is maddingly irresponsible; if you had to deal with a real adult who was that irresponsible, you'd run out of patience within the first 10 minutes. Plus, for my American ears, it was difficult at times to understand the English accents. This movie did not have a point or a theme or a story; it was just a jumble of little scenes that made no sense."
1,Couldn't finish the movie,"Thank God it was a rental. As an American, I could not understand the British lower middle class accent. Poppy does not speak the Queen's English. I didn't know if she was still high/drunk or happy go lucky. I did not make it past driving lesson #1 when it went back to the rental."
4,My Daughters and I Still Laugh...,"We have had discussions about whether this is one of the best movies around or one of the worst. But whatever it is, I can't think of many movies that we will randomly start quoting especially when I am not paying attention while driving. Don't want to oversell it but just about the time that you think that it is just a story about an overly caffeinated, funny, little flake, Poppy shows a depth/compassion as she relates to a student that just takes your breath away. Buy it..."
3,Another intense slice of life from Mike Leigh,"The lead actress, Sally Hawkins, owns this movie. Brilliant acting. In the usual style of Mike Leigh, this film examines the lives of working-class Londoners. Don't be fooled by the title - this isn't a comedy, it's a searing portrait of how people are today - abused children in the home, alienated, angry driving teachers, lonely women who binge drink. That the main character, Poppy, can keep her hopes and spirits up is a testament to the British working-class, and how they use humor to cope. Poppy calls herself ""lucky,"" but nobody in this unsparing film has found their bed of roses. At the end, as Poppy and her flatmate go boating in the park, Poppy's new love interest calls on her cell. . .maybe romance will lift her from the ""tough bits"" of daily London life."
2,Happy? I think not.,"I'm an optimist, and was looking forward to seeing a movie that promoted having a positive attitude (not the most common view in the world today, especially considering how lucky many of us are). But I was extremely uncomfortable at how such ""happiness"" was displayed. I think that Poppy used her humour like a bludgeon, and although she showed compassion at times, this was definitely countered by moments of thoughtless (one hopes) cruelty. And why did the actress, in order to show her constant glee, have to come across as such a mouth breather?"
2,I wanted to like this,"However, the main character is so annoyingly unlikeable that I had a hard time with the movie. No plot to speak of. Just a series of vignettes in which the lead character plays an overtalkative ditz who is, I guess, demonstrating to us why it's better to be positive in life than negative. She is surrounded by various unhappy people: her driving instructor, a young boy pupil, her sister etc., but she blithely either ignores their misery or tries to help them out of it. In the end, I guess it's better to be her than the angry driving instructor who has a crush on her. I did like the 1960s-style soundtrack."
1,Big mistake,We fell in love with Sally Hawkins in Jane Austin's Persuasion. We read a review in People magazine about this movie and just couldn't wait for it to come out. We knew we just had to have it in our video library. We weren't five minutes into this movie when we both realized we had made a major mistake. All I can say is that it was so awful we didn't keep it or even donate it. It went in the trash.
3,Somewhat Disappointing,"I was rather disappointed in the movie overall. The bits and pieces that are used to create the movie trailer were in fact the best parts of the film. Sadly, there was so much potential to make this movie into something magnificent, but it just faltered. I would have thought it would have been better to see someone in their early 20's with Poppy's attitude. When I learn that she is now 30 and acting so immature, it really makes the film less credible. I would highly recommend folks rent the movie before buying this. It was not the best $20 investment that I ever made."
3,Should Have Bought a New Bike,"Well, Poppy's bright personality put me off at first. It's relentlessly, ah, happy-go-lucky. She's perceptive. She's a pretty neat teacher. The film is an advertisement for the Teachers Unions I think. Bully in the schoolyard: she'll get the social worker on the job, mate. On the other hand, she's a thirty-year-old single lady with time on her hands, as her gal pals are dressing up for dance night or Flamingo lessons. There's a very funny moment in that dance lesson, but you'll see for yourself.Anyhow, Poppy grows on you. Her nemesis, the gruff, angry, Scott, the driving instructor with a mother complex and bad teeth, well, there's really uncomfortable moments for drama in a slice of life Brit comedy. It also should be noted: if you're used to fast cutting, quick action angles, this one develops slowly, sort of as if it were a BBC sitcom."
3,you can't laugh at everything,"This grade school teacher is a very modern millie who appears to laugh at everything;even when the joke isn't funny.All the flip remarks are certainly no substitute for intelligent conversation?As her room mate puts it she should stop trying to be too nice.When she does get real with her driving instructorbecause he has fallen for her happy face that hidesher inner troubles, there is an end.This movie was a hard one to watch:she looked to me to be someone who might need a bodyguardwhen she tries to make friends with a looney street person.Some people are drawn to people who behave like silly half wits,but not me."
2,Actually 2-1/2 stars,"I found it a bit average. Sally was certainly enjoyable to watch and made me laugh a few times, but it's hard to believe that people really can be THAT happy-go-lucky; certainly not in NYC anyway. She's not annoyingly peppy at all, but i found her character immature and knieve....was that the point? The ending left me feeling 'blah' which changed my opinion of the movie from 'like' to 'didnt like'."
5,Great product!,I love this ring. It is fun and it looks nice. I get compliments about it every time I wear it.
1,Wrong product,I received the wrong product it was for a totally different transmission I contacted the supplier and he fixed the problem. I gave him the same info as I did with Amazon including the VIN number. When I contacted the supplier he asked the same information and he said that he will send the right kit for my transmission. He was very helpful I will recommend him to my friends if they need parts.
5,satisfied customer,Came very fast and in good shape. Not as great a game as I remembered as a kid :)
5,The ONLY Jet Moto with 20 stages instead of 10!!!!???? WOW!!!,"MAN! This is the Jet Moto game that I been looking for!! Not only the new stages are CRAZIER, you can also play the 10 stages of Jet Moto 1!! (Of course, you must enable the code first).I personally preffer Jet Moto 1 because the graphics, characters, jets and stages look more realistic, and the sound effecs and music are more funny. But again! If you want to play a CrAzY game and a CrAzIeR game at the same time then this game is for you!! (MAN! That Nebulous stage in Jet Moto 2 is SOOO INSANE!)I haven't seen the third game but I heard that there are no 20 or 30 stages and they don't look sooo crazy.P.S: When you play the stages of Jet Moto 1, the graphics and music will be the same as the first game, but the characters and sound effecs will be different.Adios!"
2,This Game is Pales in Comparison to the First,"This game sucks. I don't say that becasue it's too hard or easy I say it becasue it doesn't live up to the name Jet Moto. Buy the first and then you'll see a real racing game. Buy this and you'll see a recycled, generic racing game with dumb racers and even dumber tracks. Save your money and get the first."
5,Mind Boggling Game/Concentration,This game invovles a lot of concentration and with time one can developed a unique sense of style to play this game. The roller coaster track makes you feel like you are actually on the roller coaster. It seems much easier to play the game using analog control. With the corners being so sharp you will need that edge. I think the game is great for any ages...
4,A GREAT Racing Game,"Jet Moto 2 has cool tracks. You can race on a roller coaster, in the snow, or in the water. In has about 20 different tracks and about 10 different characters. They have different speeds, handling, and weights. You can race with the computer or another person. I warn you the computer is HARD. Please get this game but don't get Jet Moto 3. I got bored with it in one day."
5,"A super cool game , for super cool gamers!","Jet Moto 2 rocks! It was my first game for my playstation, and it rocks!Ten players, with ten different bikes!you can play with two different players! ride on or in: mud , water, snow and concret. you can do impossible stunts if you have an analog controller! You can flip upside down, 180s, possobly 360s, you can even ride through yellow stone, and pass by old falthfull! Race on a volcano, and ride through hot lava! But watch out, some tracks you can ride off the side of the tracks, but it's funny because you can hear the person screaming! you have unlimited live so you can die as maney times as you want. Since it is rated K-A, anyone can play it, and i would say anyone who plays it will love It!"
1,Misleading Picture and Title,"Pictured is an HP printer cartridge. Also it says the product is ""by HP""... Both are not true. These are generic substitutions. I bought one and it didn't work. I returned it and bought the real HP Product (which did costs 5x more but I want a printer that works!)"
3,Crappy Prints,"I order this NEW OEM HP C4096A thru Amazon. When the box came it was all kinda busted open as it was not shipped in another box, so I couldn't tell if it was new, or cleverly ""repackaged as new. The Black Plastic inner bag was alright, but all my other HP toner carts come in the solid bubble wrap that is clearly factory... Anyway the pull out plastic ribbon was in place so it was probably new.The problem is that the toner cart prints crappy. There were mirror text streaks on the prints and now there is a gray mass background blur on all of the prints.Not very happy"
2,Sellers pushing generic cartridges - not OEM,"Both the product title, images and description states these are HP branded products. The ones I received are not. These boxes do not even have a company name on them!"
3,it did its job,"my printer was out of ink and the manufactured cartridge took a long time to get to me.. I bought this as a substitute for the price, I got what I paid for.. it printed with a shadow.. not knowing if it was properly tested before sold as remanufactured."
1,Despite what the website says this is NOT compatible with a 2300d,This is not the right printer cartridge for the HP 2300d. The Amazon website is incorrect.
3,"pennywise, pound foolish","The text prints fine, but I have a solid black smudge along the right edge of each sheet of paper--wasting tons of toner and rendering many of my print jobs unusable (can't send them out as part of a job application looking like this). I'm going to stick with name-brand HP cartridges from now on."
1,Toner cartridge problem,The cartridge is faulty. It leaves a ghost image that transfers to the paper. I called to request a refund or exchange. They said they would send return instructions within 24 to 48 hours. I'm still waiting 3 days later.
1,They LIED!!!!!!!!!!!!,What I received was Chineese clone!!! it is NOT OEM as the orginal ad implied. I expected one HP origanl and I got two of these POS!!!!
1,Huge Disappointment,"I bought this at the end of August but did not put in my printer until September - past the 30 day return policy. I had problems from the beginning. It said it was in original packaging but it must not have come from the factory. Lines showed up on all my pages. All attempts to clean (used the original manual suggestions, online suggestions and even bought a cleaning kit) failed. Huge waste of my time and money and now I need to find another source as I have purchased this from Amazon before and can no longer trust them."
4,No Problems So Far,"I haven't had any problems with my cartridge. Does leave a light black line on the side of a few sheets of paper but for the price, who cares?"
1,Messy,"The toner leaks all over the printer causing the paper to look black. Makes a big mess, and causes illegible printing jobs."
1,bad batch,We have used this toner for years and never had a problem. don't know why this particular one left wide smear stripes all over the printed paper.
1,Very poor quality,There are ghost images. The quality is very poor. I would not buy this unless you do not need clear copies.
1,Defective product,Defective cartridge or possibly damaged in transit. Printed vertical or horizontal lines on pages immediately upon installation. Had to be returned.
3,It's Gershwin Time,"Nice collection of music. Surprising how old recordings can be so update. I enjoyed it very much, but don't forget that I'n an early boomer."
3,One book too many in this trilogy,"O.K., this novel is nice to read. But is there anything that has not already been said in the first two novels? Prot's view of the world does not change, the narrator's view of prot and doubts about him either. So Gene Brewer concentrates on Robert's secret and the reader is interested only in the question whether prot is an alien or whether all this might be a case of multiple personality as suggested in the first two novels. It would have been a good idea to solve the problem at the end of book II.This is a good example that it is not always worth while squeezing another book out of a good idea. Of, course, all those who liked the first two sequels buy the third book, but the question is whether they are satisfied after reading it. I admit, it is still amusing and reflective at the same time, so buying the book was no waste of money. But as you know: sometimes less is more."
3,incomplete,"I was disappointed to see that not all Hildegarde's visions have been translated and included. The editing seems primarily to eliminate those visions popularly believed to refer to the future ""end times"". Almost the entire section of ""vision eleven"", dealing with that subject, has been edited out.The book is definitely useful as a reference for the character of St. Hildegarde, and the ""language"" of dreams & visions, however I was, as I said, disappointed with what seems to be a ""censoring"" of the material."
3,Man With The Trumpet,"This is not the best album if you like the music of Ray Anthony - however it does cover quite a period of his career. He played with the Glenn Miller orchestra and eventually went on his own. The problem I have with this album is too many vocals. On the plus side, all but 1 selection is the origional mono. You'll find a song 'Marilyn' written for Marilyn Monroe also 'Melody of Love' with vocals by one Frank Sinatra. Overall not a bad album but there are better ones out there if you're into strictly instrumentals."
3,My Review,"25 Aug, 2007I can hardly lay claim to the title of ""Music Critic"".All I know is what I like.I like the music on this album.W.F. Sullivan"
4,Marilyn's Man,"I liked this documentary and actually cried while watching it. (What a great song, ""All About Love"") Jim elucidates his love for Norma Jeane; proof that if you do love someone or something you sometimes have to let it go. The film has a real natural flow to it. I would highly recommend it to anyone wanting to see a different perspective on things...not to mention great photos, too."
3,sentimental but sloppy,"I have to agree that the film is very poorly edited. It is touching and interesting, but poorly done.FYI one of the pictures in one of the many photo montages is not Marilyn Monroe, it is a a Marilyn Monroe look-alike...me!The picture has been my publicity shot for over 13 years and has been published in books and on many websites as being me in all that time. The producer refuses to admit his mistake, so to try to halt any future confusion I am letting you all know here.As for the film...its worth seeing because Marilyn is in it."
2,Where's the Fun?,"As I started out through the 3D world I was a little excited about finally starting another Castlevania adventure that I haven't had since I played the NES. Well after a few hours of playing I can say this did not at all hold up to my expectations. Immediately I grew frustrated trying to jump from one small ledge to another so early in the game. Then I moved on to disappointment when it became clear that I would be seeing the same creatures the whole game, and finally I just got bored of the game and stopped only on level 5. I could've kept going but it lacked storyline and imagination. Just got tired fighting the same dead skeletons and not knowing why I was doing it."
3,If I could figure out how to play it I'm sure it would be great!,"So, I bought this game and was satisfied with the amount of time it took to ship. It also plays well, I have no problem getting it to work. The only reason I can't give this game five stars is because I'm stuck in it and can't figure out where to go next. It's one of those games that if you don't look up every little detail on the internet or have someone experienced playing with you then you're going to get lost quickly. I haven't made it far past the starting screen, I'm just sort of trapped where I am. I love different sorts of Castlevania games and would recommend this to someone who has a bit more time on their hands or someone who really knows what they're doing."
2,Boring,Interesting game at first with lots of enemies to fight but the later levels revolve mostly around making difficult jumps. Would not reccomend.
4,Castlevania - Nintendo 64,"Extremely difficult to play unless you're an expert.Great graphics.Problem with this video game is that it does get old after maybe an hour or so.Many levels to conquer.I'd only recommend this game to those who have plenty of patience.You know,the SAME kind of patience you need to have while on Ebay just waiting for a posted item's time to run out while them other 'have no-life' buyers often snipe the item YOU wanted SO badly in the last fifteen seconds.That kind of patience."
4,Castlevania 64 is a true gaming experience!,"Konami decided to take another step on the Castlevania series and put it in 3-D instead of a side scroller/2-D, and they did an awesome job! The graphics are good, but fuzzy (but hey its N64!) Awesome bosses, and it took me a while to beat it. You can choose from 2 characters Reinhardt and Carrie. Both have their own weapon but they both have their down side too. Reinheardt has the old school Castlevania weapon, the whip and a secondary weapon the dagger. But he is NOT a good choice for long range attacks. Carrie is a good choice if you want to stay far away from an enemy because she can shoot a magcical weapon, an energy ball, and secondary weapon-the magical rings on her arms. She is not as popular as Reinhardt, but she is very good. If you want to have an old school weapon, choose Reinhardt. If you want to beat the game choose normal.(with easy you only go to level five) The only downside is that the Final Dracula is VERY,VERY HARD."
1,Symphony is ten times better,"I must say,I find ZELDA More fun then this game..it is extreamly borning,it has annoying graphics and I beat this in a day and a half!! it discusted me.. Symphony of the night was much better then this poor excuse for a video game!!!! Konami did a poor job at making this game..I find CastleVania BLOODLINES more exhillerating!"
5,The best castlevania yet!,"This is the best game I have ever played on n64.I would even say it blows Zelda out of the water.It incorperates all the things from the old Castelvania but has 3d excitement , great monsters, daytime changes, mystery, a lotta' vampires, and a set of charcters."
1,Hate it. Too hard to use,This thing is ridiculous. I hated eye drops.. this thing made using them worse. If you don't want to use eyedrops I suggest using an eyemist. Natures tears is a great one.
1,Stupid. Hate eye drops. Hate this more.,This thing is ridiculous. I hated eye drops.. this thing made using them worse. If you don't want to use eyedrops I suggest using an eyemist. Natures tears is a great one.
4,Auto-Drop Great Assistance for Eye Drops,Simple and easy to use. Puts eye drops in the right place the first time over 95% of the time. Great price too!
1,Doesn't work with small bottles.,Can't use it with my glaucoma or dry eye drops. That's all I wanted it for and it doesn't work with them.
1,Doesn't work,I had better luck getting the drops into my eye without the guide. I don't think I would recommend it.
3,Autodrop Eyedrop Guide,This eye drop guide is a good idea but has a problem that I think would be hard to overcome. Not all eyedrop bottles are the same and this guide will not accommodate the different sizes of bottle necks. Luckily the prescription eye drop bottle with the expensive liquid inside did fit and I was able to use it with out missing my eye most of the time.
2,"I HAD HIGH HOPES FOR THIS CD, BUT...",OVER THE YEARS I HAVE BEEN HIGHLY ENTERTAINED BY THE BOSTON POPS ORCHESTRA. THIS TIME WITH THIS CD WAS A LITTLE DIFFERENT. ON FIRST LOOKILNG AT THE VARIOUS TRACKS OF THIS CD I WAS EXCITED. IT LOOKED LIKE IT MIGHT BE A GREAT CD. AFTER PURCHASING THIS CD AND PLAYING IT I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED. THE ARRANGEMENTS DID NOT SEEM TO BE MASTERFUL. OUT OF 15 SONGS ALL I COULD FIND WAS 6 SONGS I TRULEY LIKED. I KNOW IT MUST HARD TO ALWALYS DEVELOP A GOOD PROJECT.
1,This E-40 album is WIGGITY WIGGITY WACK!,"Man, E-40 gots skills and his beats are tight, but on ""Charlie Hustle,"" he doesn't come with it like he usually does. All of the cuts on this album lyrically sound the same, and after awhile, it gets irritating hearing E-40 blabber on about a bunch of non-sense...especially all of that ""flossin ice"" and ""big ballin'"" garbage. On top of that, ""Big Ballin' With My Homies"" is one of the many biggest disgraces in hip-hop music and definitely one of the worst songs I've ever heard. This album ain't with it and E-40 ain't with it."
2,PURE JUNK !,E-40 MAKES ME SICK AND HE MAKES ME LAUGH TO MY STOMACH.I HATE THIS ALBUM I DIDN'T EVEN BUY IT I HEARD IT FROM A FRIEND.THIS ALBUM IS NEVER WORTH BUYING.
5,WAY TO FEDERAL FOR THE STREETS........,tHIS hERE gAME e fEEZY lACIN iS wAY tO sICC. hE'S bEEN lACIN mY bOOTS sINCE fEDERAL. hE'S wAY tO vERSITILE hE'S gOT aLOT oF tALENT. nEW mONEY yA rIGHT hE'S bEEN mAKIN cHEEZ yA'LL hATERZ nEED tO qUIT kEEP dOIN yA tHUG tHANG.
5,new found respect for fonzarelli,"i NEVER liked E-40 before! to me, he never had any songs that stood out at all, but when i heard ""Big Ballin With My Homie's"", which samples MY POSSE'S ON BROADWAY by Sir Mix A Lot, i knew i was gonna get this album! the best song is ""Look At Me"" featuring The CASH MONEY CLICK. then ""Big Ballin With My Homies"" then ""Ghetto Celebrity"" then ""Mouthpiece"". so i now like E-40, and to my surprise, this album is 10 times better than TOO SHORT's new album Can't Stay Away, that album is W-E-A-K! but the last album i bought that was the bomb was Project Pat's Ghetty Green, go cop it!"
5,Hauntingly beautiful,"Ma plays with his usual passion and virtuosity and is matched by the Philadelphia Orchestra under Zinman's direction. These are dark, beautiful meditations on life and loss. Rouse's Violincello in particular builds to a shattering climax. Not pleasant background music, these pieces demand the listener's full attention. I had the good fortune to hear Ma perform Danielpour's piece at its premiere performances with the San Francisco Symphony. The recording captures all the energy and emotion of that thrilling experience."
1,IS YO-YO STRINGING US ALONG?,"After being assaulted by these so-called ""premiere"" recordings by American modernists, I was perplexed, stunned, then livid. I would hardly consider myself inclined towards late twentieth century music; but be that as it may, I do have a fairly open mind. Unfortunately, the caustic bombast that profusely blasts from this SONY ""vanity disc"" simply appalled me. Could music this abyssmal actually gain public forum with Ma, Zinman and the Philadelphia Orchestra taking the reins? At its very best, the Danielpour Concerto for Cello is an absolute musical monstrosity--- abrasive and an insult to one's intelligence and sensibilities. Kirchner's tedious Music for Cello and Orchestra is a hectoring compilation of notes; and the Rouse Violoncello Concerto--- abominable and confrontational. I find the lack of insight, imagination and humanity pixilating.[Running time 79:13]"
1,"Yeah, It was Good in the 80s, but Now...Nah.","Viewed: 9/04, 3/06Rate: 23/06: American Ninja is a cheesy, mindless cult flick made with extremely low intelligence. If I am to disregard the logics of the plot and the subplots and think of the film as brainless, then the movie is simply quite boring and mindless. There is not much to look forward to in American Ninja, although there is a couple of good characters in Michael Dudikoff and Steve James, who manage to shine much better in the sequel. It is pointless to discover the many faults of American Ninja. I am a good fan of the Ninja genre, and American Ninja has plenty of Ninja action. Judie Aronson is a major babe in this film, so feast your eyes on her when the going gets boring in American Ninja."
4,"THIS WAS A GOOD MOVIE, SCREW WHAT THEM CRITICS SAID!","IN THIS CULT CLASSIC, AN ARMY RECRUIT [MICHAEL DUDIKOFF] MUST STOP THE ARMY FROM DOING A MAJOR WEAPONS DEAL WITH SOME RICH BAD GUYS. THOUGH THERE REALLY ISN'T MUCH TO THE MARTIAL ARTS THAT'S DISPLAYED HERE, IT'S STILL A FUN MOVIE TO WATCH, DESPITE THE BAD THINGS THAT ALL THE CRITICS HAVE SAID ABOUT THIS MOVIE AND ITS SEQUELS, I'LL ADMIT IT, I REALLY ENJOYED THIS MOVIE. SCREW WHAT ALL THE CRITICS SAY, GO PICK UP THIS MOVIE NOW. MICHAEL DUDIKOFF AND STEVE JAMES HAVE AMAZING CHEMISTRY. FOLLOWED BY FOUR SEQUELS."
4,"Dudikoff, baby!","Our buddies at Cannon figured they should strike while the iron was hot and get a little more out of their successful ninja franchise. Having found success with already established action stars, they tried to make their own in the form of MICHAEL DUDIKOFF-THE AMERICAN NINJAAAAAA! Well, Dudikoff never achieved superstardom, but he'll always be recognized as ""Joe"". His screen presence isn't bad at all. He's got a boyish look and a rather soft spoken demeanor different from most action tough guys. He plays a soldier who, like Rodney, gets no respect. When he finally beats Steve James(a cool sidekick I might add) in a fight, he becomes rather popular. He takes on an army of evil ninjas that threaten the fate of the world! Ther lead ninja is a mean brute who kills his fellow ninjas during routine practices. This movie's fun.....very fun. Sure it's lame as all hell, but someone must have liked it coz it spawned four sequels."
4,Nostalgic Ninja Fights!!! Good Movie...,"Great movie!! It remainds me the old times, when my primal preferences at the video store where the ninja movies!! Well, I must say that this one is one of the best of all them!!! Good movie for a collector, and also for martial arts fans! Good buy, for a low price!"
2,Disappointment,"I bought the movie with great curiosity as it was one of the most popular martial-arts movies of my childhood. Unfortunately, I was disappointed with the story, direction, and acting. Martial-arts scenes are definitely unsuccessful in terms of choreography and editing. Moreover, I watched much better martial artists than Michael Dudikoff. Probably, he was chosen for this role not because he was good at ninjutsu ( Actually, he doesn't seem to be an expert ) but because he was a handsome guy.I do not recommend this movie."
4,"Sure it's not Lucas or Kubrick it's b action movie take for what it is!,",Amercian Ninja is a gulity pleasure if anything. The film has some decent fight scenes and some good B movie acting. Mike Dudkoff and Steve James are some smooth pimps in the movie bringing it to the man as only they can. If you like 80's karate movies then check this out.
4,"""He possess great skill !!!""","""American Ninja"" is one of my favourite 80's actioners produced by the unforgettable Golan-Globus team of ""Delta Force"" fame.Though the body count is not massive, there are definitely some stirring scenes, in particular the truck hijack by the black-star ninja and the final confrontation with throwing stars, lasers, mini-bullet firing gloves etc. etc.Dudikoff is a decent actor, mute most of the time, while the colonel's daughter is just fun.The reunion with his childhood ninja mentor is high level (unintentional) comedy, ""Ninjaish"" dialogue galore.Overall, a solid action film that should be frequently watched and appreciated."
3,Some good action scenes enhance a mediocre film,"Michael Dudikoff must fight the corruption in his ranks as military equipment is being stolen from the army by mysterious ninjas,Steve James comes off shinning with his part. good action,and Dudikoff ain't too bad either."
2,"Is not real, Jimmy!","Interesting and relatively new documentary on the great James Dean,but efforts of family, friends and colleagues have already seen and some statements of dubious reliabilityNot very good release...ONLY FOR VERY STRAIGHT JAMES DEAN FANS!"
3,For you who haven't buy any K's choice album yet,"Well, all I gotta say is that the preicieding reviews should have been written by fans. As a... let's say ""neutral"" fan, this album though pretty good shouldn't be rated 5 stars. For me ""Paradise in Me"" is way better and it contains the hit ""Not an Addict"". If you still don't have it , let's buy this one first. ""The great subconscious club"" is more intimate and calm like the first Cranberries album ""Everybody else is doing it so why can't we""."
5,One of the best never-heard-of albums ever,"I bought this album after I bought Paradise in Me, and I thought it would be a typical not-as-good freshman album. Boy, was I wrong! This album has a completely different sound than the second, and it's wonderfull! It goes from whymsical to heart-wrenching between a few tracks. Songs like 'Me Happy', 'Breakfast', and 'I Smoke a Lot' set the lighthearted atmosphere, but then songs like 'My Heart' throw you. 'My Heart' is one of my personal favorite songs ever. It's one of the few songs ever that provoke and emotional response from me, and when I play it on the guitar, and my friend sings, it's almost a religious experiance. Take my word for it, buy this album."
5,"Great music, great band!","Johnny Clegg has done a wonderful thing with his fusion of African/Western music. I love listening to this album. They saxophone, keyboard and flute by Keith Hutchinson on this album is definitely unique and adds body and feeling to the music. I love their music."
2,Game Day 99,"This has to be one of the worst video games ever released. Although the graphics are impressive and the options are strong, 989 Studios should refund to everyone their $40-50 that was originally paid for this game. I have never bought or played a video game that has more ""bugs"" or errors than this one. It was like these guys over at 989 studios just decided to release this poor product regardless of all of the glitches, and could care less about the qaulity of the product. My advice: Don't let these guys con you into buying another cheap quality game from them. I probably will not buy from these guys again."
2,Good in the begining,Gameday was good while it lasted. When I first got it for Christmas two years ago it was a good game. But as you play it a little bit it gets rather old. THe graphics aren't the best in a game. Buy the game if you want a one time game. If you want something that you can play more then once then buy NFL Blitz 2000!
4,Solid football.,"This is still agreat football game, but there is not really enough new since last year's title. The graphics are really good, but they look all to similar to last year's. The gameplay is the best yet, and it is set aside by some great commentary and rock music clips that keep the action flowing along quite nicely."
5,"Great Sneaker, wide and EASY to put on","We loved this pair of sneakers for my 22 mo. old so much that we bought it in the next size up so that we/he could keep using them. They are so easy to get on him, and we all know some are SO difficult. These slide right on while pulling the tongue. They are also wide enough for his ""flinstone"" feet, lol. They break in well for flexibility too."
4,good but salty,"I would order them again because I haven't found other whole wheat pretzels, but they seem saltier than other pretzels I've had. The sesame seeds add a lot."
5,Delicious whole wheat pretzels!,I have been looking for 100% whole wheat pretzels for a long time. These are the only ones I've been able to find. They are very good...the only trouble I'm having is not eating the whole bag! :)
5,VERY DISSAPOINTED!!,"I love these pretzels, but now I can never order them because you took them off subscribe and save!! They are way to expensive now, who can afford that??!! I hav e been ordering these for a long time, I sure wish they have let me know they were taking them off subscribe and save, I would have ordered them one last time!!"
5,"Great, GREAT music","The Kingston Trio gets little respect these days, but its music is great and - as this CD shows - it holds up wonderfully. This CD contains the Trio's very best work and you can hear the future of popular music in its tracks: the sliding harmonies of the Beatles, the ""wall of vocals"" sound of the Beach Boys, the single note guitar runs of Fleetwood Mac and even the Caribbean sunshine of Jimmy Buffet. A couple of tracks show the insensitivity of the era (it was the late 1950s) but the music far outweights this shortcoming."
4,ajrsdr,It is always interesting to hear an early work of the Trio and a live performance from the Hungry I doesn't get any better. Some of the songs were less polished than they would become in later performances but it is a nice time capsule.
4,Like the good old days,"I had this Kingston Trio album when I was younger and I wore it out. Now that I have bought the CD, I on my way to testing how many times I can play it before it gives up. I guess I'm a sucker for banjo music, clever banter and good harmony.Dave Guard, the most creative, most talented one left them too soon to pursue other interests and died too young.Their music makes me smile and want to harmononize with them. Welcome back boys, It's been too long."
4,You can go home aqain!,"What a blast from the past. Even songs that I thought I had forgotten seemed familiar. The Kingston Trio was such a huge part of my college years that when I realized I could get them on C.D.s I began my second collection of their music. Now, I can listen at home or in the car and love them just as much as I did bac in the 50's and 60's This collection was one of their first and I love it now just as I did fifty years ago."
4,Cafe Culture Circa the Sixties,"This album presents an excellent audio ""hear"" of the kind of cafe entertainment that was considered ""hip"" as well as popular in the mid-sixties. You will get the flavor of the kind of humor as well as folk music that was considered somewhat adult at the time but will seem tame by today's standards. The Hungry I in San Francisco was hugely popular and featured many performers on their way up such as singers Joan Baez and Barbra Streisand and comedienne Phyllis Diller. Also this album is a fun look at the lighter side of the decade."
1,WHERE IS TEST EQUIPMENT?,"To all reviewers who give this book an excellent / good rating, and a WARNING to potential buyers:I am forced to click a star rating for this review, however, it really should be a zero, or a negative number:Descriptions of this book say something about building your own testing equipment. This is not included in the table of contents. Can anyone verify there is a test equipment section? I looked at a copy in the local library - and there is NO TEST EQUIPMENT IN THIS BOOK. Perhaps there is a later edition that includes a test equipment section?Please advise. Otherwise - DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK - it is a RIP-OFF."
2,Mid-fi with little explanation,"This is an extension of Slone's earlier book and it is a little better, but not a lot. He reiterates everything he said earlier-ranging from opinion to nonsense-and then as before launches into his pet designs with little good explanation.If you want to build a Class B semi-serious amplifier for instrument or PA or non-serious-listening use this will probably work, although there are a lot of old 70s and 80s designs readily available at your local library in old electronics and audio magazines.If understanding the trends in serious audio work today is your goal, start with the ""horses mouth"" JAES paper ""Tubes vs. Transistors: Is There A Difference?"". This was hugely important because it was the first published paper in professional reviewed circles that addressed the possibility that traditional metrics such as THD,frequency range, and S/N might not fully address problems in professional audio."
5,A Store House of Audio Information.,"Randy has done a wonderful job of compiling a tremendous amount of information and high quality schematics in one book. ""Source"" in the title of this book is apply named. I thoroughly enjoy the nearly A-Z coverage of Audio circuits and the high degree of common sense descriptions that go along with them. If you are an Audio Hobbiest, then you should not be with out this book."
4,Sony has an excellent response to Sonic the Hedgehog,"Because it is a CD based unit a lot of the games on the Sony Playstation have a tendancy to be slow in their game play, especally while they boot up into the system. ""Crash Bandicoot"" does not have a lot of statistics that it needs to download so all you have to do is hit start and within moments the fun begins. With rich graphics and an adorable character ""Crash Bandicoot"" will have people who enjoy games like ""Sonic the Hedgehog"" and ""Donkey Kong"" sitting on their couches and playing this game until their thumbs become rigid with arthritis. Young children whll enjoy Crash's antics, especally when the game comes to a stop for a few moments and Crash is forced to wait for the player to continue. Older players will like all of the hidden extra levels and bonuses that they can trip over during game play."
5,THE BEST GAME OF ALL TIME,"It's that simple Crash Bandicoot is the best game of all time. It crushes Mario 64 and places right up there with Goldeneye and Jumping Flash. Why you may ask? Well, it may seem only fair in rating standards, but it is simply so much fun. From the hog chasing level to the boss Pinstripe the Potteroo. Combine this with excellent graphics and immersive game play make this a real winner. That and the story's pretty cool. So strap on your helmate and prepare for battle with APAAATARAIACAK, CAUSE THIS IS ONE WILD RIDE."
3,I'd buy it used,"I bought this game when I first got my PS1 because I loved playing my cousin's Crash Bandicoot 2 game. While this game is fun, the part I hate about it is you have no control over when you can save the game. You are given the option at odd points in the game, and even if you beat 3 levels after the level you saved at, if you start over, you'll start at the level you saved at, and not the one you most recently beat....I recommend getting this game because it IS fun..."
4,A very cool game,"Crash Bandicoot is the best. If you are patient and like running around crashing boxes open, jumping over holes in the ground, running under jungle rollers, and doing away with skunks, this is the game for you! There is only one problem that I found. You can crash certain boxes open to get a free life, but when you run out of them, you have to do the previous level over, too. But don't worry. I am an impatient person sometimes, and I get along fine. I just bought this game, believe it or not, and it's the coolest."
4,A Game with some Mistakes,"This game has very good graphics and music, but it has some mistakes. Naughty Dog really goofed up on this game, like when you can only save on the Tawna Bonus Rounds-(how many times does that come up?!) You cant move very fast, and you aren't able to jump that far either. Finishing the hard levels can take a while, like Toxic Waste with bouncing barrels that you can't beat. It can be frusterating. It's fun, but it doesn't have as many powers as Crash Bandicoot 2 or Warped. They don't give you a lot of Wumpa Fruits in the hardest levels when you need them most to earn a life. You really have to work at this game, you just don't finish it in 2 days-(Unless you know secrets about the game or you put in the secret password.) All in all this is a cool game."
4,Good game,"I got this for my boyfriend, and he's loved this game since it released. I got a big grin from him about it. I did buy the game used, and there was a few more scratches than initially indicated. But, it seems the disc works fine and it doesn't interrupt with game play, which is what's important. So far, excellent purchase!"
3,Crash!,Ok...This game was awesome when it first came out. Now it's getting old. Just rent it. You could beat this game in two days.
5,A Really Cool Game,"Crash Bandicoot 2 was my first Playstation game. When I was seven, I was very frustrated with it. A year or so later, I decided to try again, I loved it so much I bought the first one(which to me was even more of a challenge). When the 3rd one came out I bought it too. I've rented CTR and just bought THE WRATH OF CORTEX. I'm a big Crash lover, but the first one's my favorite. It's challenging and fun."
5,crash bandicoot,"I thought that this was an excelent game. I found it was easy to follow and the levels where thrilling, they got more and more difficult as you went allong. My favourie level was HOG WILD I got a gem on that. I found it really annoying in the levels when you got all the boxes and then you find out that there was a secret passegway and you have missed something like eight boxes. Over all it has been my favourite playstation game and now I am moving on to crash Bandicoot 2."
3,Fun but Naughty Dog Let Out Some Things!!!,"You can only save this game every once and a while. Also you only get passwords every once and a while. ( Of coarse you get stuck on the levels with no passwords or save points. ) Also I hate running from the boulders. ALL YOU DO IS RUN. The object is to get to the end of each level. There are bosses along the way. They seem to be too easy or too hard. ( It figures.) I think you should get Crash 2, Crash 3, or Crash Team Racing. Those games are MUCH BETTER."
4,Purchased as Gift,"I ordered Crash Bandicoot as a friend's birthday gift. Her's was an original and was stuck in a level, she couldn't find a replacement anywhere so was excited when I did. It arrived promptly, in good condition, complete with manual, back cover insert & case. I would definitely purchase again from Ren_Hoek/Amazon."
3,Really three 1/2 stars,This game was fun and all but it was hard as heck. It was so hard that I had to put in a cheat to get all levels so I could skip the levels I couldn't beat. I don't know who the people can beat it because I can't. I mean does the guy who created this game expect us to beat it? I mean you can't even crawl. YOU HAVE TO PLAY THIS GAME!!! but beware it's the hardest game ever.
3,The one that started it all! It's easy to tell.,"Seeing as how this is the first Crash game, it pains me to have to give this game a 3. The only thing that makes this game not quite as good as the others is it's lack of a very big story(and not to mention a horrible ending). Otherwise, this game isn't so bad. I give this game a 3 and a half. The graphics, gameplay, and music are fairly good. This game got me into the whole Crash Bandicoot Trilogy; and the games just get better along the way!"
3,The First Crash Game.....,"isn't really that good. Though you should buy it if you are a fan of Crash, but if you are just looking for a good game, buy Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back or Crash Bandicoot: The Wrath of Cortex."
5,The game that made me get a Playstation(in 1998).,"This is the second best Crash. The best is Crash 2. The complaints what people will go on are being able to move backwards and forwards like a 2D game, Well it was back in 1995 or so. The game isn't hard until 65% through.Buy this if you want a very good platformer."
5,Crash Bandicoot.,"I love everything about this game. Theave systems are notas good as liked, but, it's better then not being able to save at all. I like these Crash Games so much that I made books that my family loves to read about the series. I also like the bosses, but I am a little upset that you don't see the bosses in very many other games. I can say that I am disappointed about it not being sold in very many stores. I can say that I also am disappointed about the way some kids judge the graphics and unfair task of getting all the gems. It's fair and if you're so upset about it enter this password:Triangle[4],X,square,triangle[4],square,X,triangle,O,triangle[3],O,square,triangle,X[4]. There that will give you everthing. I can say that everyone is entittled to thier own opinion, but it's not like it's the end of the world because it's not perfect to everyone's opinion. I have simply that much to say about this."
3,CB,i used to play this all the time when i was little. the graphic quality is low because its the first one but i still love this game.
4,Delta X5 variable speed drill press.,"I purchased this machine new a while back. Generally it is a very good machine. It has plenty of power and the variable speed controls work easily. The 6"" stroke is very nice. The table is flat and true but the design leaves a little to be desired for a wood shop. The only way to really clean it is to blow it out with compressed air. I did not like the opened top. I immediately built a hinged cover for the top. In a wood shop a lot of dust would collect and probably cause problems at some point. The machine is quite noisy compared to most drill presses. The chuck is massive and looks good but I had trouble with it becoming very hard to adjust and had to clean and lubricate it frequently. I finally replaced the chuck with a good Jacobs chuck. Over all this machine is a nice addition to the shop."
3,Bad belt drive on two drills-Poor design.,From the day I bought this drill it has been a series of problems all related the the primary variable v-belt. The belt would slip when in low range(high torque)so I took it to the authorized repair shop. They worked on it but when I first used it the belt flopped around so much it jambed and stalled the motor. Back to the repair shop-wasn't very happy to be taking the trip. They worked on it and didn't encourage me to come back. Still had the problem so I called Delta service-they sent me a complete power head including the motor. The serial number on the replacement unit was older than my original unit other than that it was identical. The replacement unit has the same lack of torque in low range. It can't drill a 1/2 hole in steel so I avoid using at all.This is a woodworking drill with a metal working table. I own a lot of good Delta equipment and tools so it was a major disappointment to get one that is that is so poorly designed.
2,BEWARE OF THIS PRODUCT!!!,"If you read Amazons review of this product - it illudes that this Drill press comes with a Jacobs Chuck & yet it DOES NOT!!!! It comes with a CHEAP off BRAND chuck with a Jacobs Taper!!! BIG DIFFERENCE!!!! They also will do nothing to correct this problem!!!This is what thier review says;We like that the power switch is right on the front of the head, rather than on the side, for quick starts and stops. When we examined the 1/2-inch chuck, we found yet more quality in the Jacobs name."
5,Fabulous Mix,"This is a terrific album. Sunday mornings, late nights, all around great album. Dinah Washington's version of ""I Wanna Be Around"" is not to be missed!"
5,Great Introductory Book on Soft Computing,"For a beginner that wants to know where the stories about Soft Computing really converge, this book is a starting point. The style of the author is simple and great.My interest was to get a book that keeps the daunting mathematical jargons in Fuzzy Logic (contained in several other books) minimal, while presenting the concepts. I fell in love with this book, that I had to run through all the pages as if it's a novel.This book really demonstrates that the whole idea behind intelligent systems are simple and straightforward. You do not need another teacher. He presented algorithms (e.g. back-propagation)in a very simple to understand manner.Dr. Michael Negnevitsky, the author, must be a great teacher. It's a handy and nice book. I strongly recommend it."
4,Hmmm...,"Believe it or not, most of the time I spend on music is with jazz. But, every now and again, it's good to clear out the little ""clogged"" Eustachian tube: Metallica's ""Black"" album does the trick just nicely, so does one of the all time favorites, Ruts' ""The Crack"". Nativity In Black is also recommended, particularly the mighty ""Wizard"". But, if I really want to be thorough, the original Black Sabbath records will spin again."
2,not that great,i'm not sure to whom this record was targeted at...but it sure as hell wasn't the sabbath fan. biohazard? ugly kid joe? most of this album is sadly lacking any intensity that the real black sabbath had...wake me when it's over.
5,A treat for Sabbath fans,"This album is a great album overall. If you have never listened to Black Sabbath it will get you on Sabbath on no time. And if your a long time fan of Sabbath, then you will hear your favorite songs overdone by the best heavy metal bands of the present. There are some great performances by Biohazard, White Zombie, Megadeth, Faith No More, and Type O' Negative. Ugly Kid Joe's version of N.I.B is very addictive and heavy. And Bruce Dickinson sings on this one better than ever. Overall all the songs are great. A must bye! My favorites... first 3 songs and last 2!!!!"
5,one of the best,"The best Tribute album to Black Sabbath. Starting out with Biohazard doing a fast paced cover of ""after forever"" followed by Rob Zombie in his usual style with Children of the Grave. Not many people could be better to do such a song. Megadeth does a speed metal version of ""paranoid"" which I must say i like better than the original. Espicially good since Most remixes of Paranoid tend to be techno or industrial. Another cornerpiece of the album is ""sympton of the universe"" by sepultura. Playing a fast beat and with powerful vocals with the casual clasical guitar piece at the end. The only song I did not like on this album was Black Sabbath by Type O Negative. Black Sabbath does not sound good ""Gothic"" in my opinion."
5,Amazing compilation cd!!!,"The first time I heard this cd, it totally freaked me out- and Sabbath became my favorite band ever since. I remember all the original versions, I thought they ruled-but I was very young then and had no idea who was singing the songs. I listened to it one day,and I even got my friends (who were into that grunge stuff at the time)to rock out on it! I knew then that Ozzy and Sabbath were heavy metal gods.That night I went out and bought tickets for the Ozzmosis tour in 1996,it was my first Ozzy show, and it was such a trip to see Ozzy sing some Sabbath at his show. OZZY IS MY GOD!!! :)"
4,As good as a tribute album gets,"I hate Megadeth, i hate biohazard, and i really hate Sepultura. Biohazard has this lame ass ebonics intro to After Forever. And the vocals from Megadeth and Sepultura are just plain shit. On a positive note is Type-O Negative. The original version of Black Sabbath is way overrated. I personally think it is just a flat out bad song. TON really does some work to it and makes it listenable. It is a good album even though i do'nt listen to a third of it."
4,It's Now After Forever,"Biohazard does a version of After Forever thats more mindblowing than the 30 year old original plus it includes a NYC hardcore mosh breakdown that will spell trouble. Sepultura, White Zombie and C.O.C. also provide some stunning Black Sabbath interpretations. Hear all the originals and then check this out."
2,Not a Sabbath experience.,"With all the efforts put into this album, and all the great bands' participation this album has nothing special to offer to the listener. The original recordings are next to impossible to duplicate, and none of the artists on this compilation have the doomy/dark feeling that the original Black Sabbath injected into the listener's veins."
2,A minor accomplishment,2 1/2Luke-warm tribute to the Metal godfathers feels a little unnecessary throughout with static recreations and generic interpretations which fortunately picks up a little life in the final stretch.
4,One plant geek's opinion,"This book is a must-have for botanists and plant enthusiasts in the region. It gives glimpses of historical vegetation which has mostly been lost. It is one of the few botanical records we have of the era and region before widescale agriculture.Many of the plant names have changed since publication and it takes some detective work to run them down, but that is part of the fun."
2,Best of Rance Allen Group,Not my kind of gospel. Too much R&B lyrics turn around to gospel. I do not recommend this to real gospel lovers.
4,Great for the money,"I installed this generator with the hope that I'll never use it for more than the weekly exercise cycle; then came Hurricane Wilma. The generator came on during the 1st part of the storm and stayed on for 5 days until the utility power was restored. The generator performed flawlessly. I ran most everything I needed including the pool motor. The external gfi outlets allowed me to use an electic chainsaw to cut a 30' palm tree from my driveway. This unit was priceless and am happy with it. My only issues are that the exterior shell is cheap, it's noisier than I'd like and it burned ~0.7 qt of oil during the 5 day run it had. Other than that, it was great for the money. The installation instructions were a breeze too."
1,no customer service from generac wounld not buy again,first one did not work replace it with a refurbished one tried calling generac to get a new one not a refurbished one. it was a week old when it broke down ran once.called customer service and this is how they take care of a customer. they have no customer service at all they said basically to bad.
4,THE MOULIN ROUGE QUEEN OF SOUL !,"This song was made in the 70s but, Mya,Pink,Christina Aguilera, and Lil' Kim and permission to copy Patti Labelle's hit song ""Lady Marmalade"". The song remade by the young talented artists did the movie for the movie ""Moulin Rouge""."
4,Well worth the price,"A nice, interesting book with a lot of useful information on probabilistic structural analysis, but does not follow the current industrial practice that is leaning towards stochastic FEA and FORM/SORM based limit state analysis. If you want to understand modern structural reliability theory, or plan to work in probabiistic design, I would strongly reccomend the textbooks by Haldar & Mahadevan. In short, Prof. Elishakoff's book will be a nice companion volume, but not a main reference. Cant beat the price, though."
4,One of the best dub jobs I've ever seen!,"I am a huge fan of YuYu Hakusho, and this is one of the best dubs ever! Unlike most dubs,the voices fit the characters perfectly.Yusuke and Kuwabara have appropriatelyrough adolesant voices, with Kuwabara's having an idiotic tinge to it.Hiei's and Kurama's voices sound cool and demonic. I have nothing against the japanese version, but Yusuke sounded too deep.Greatest action anime ever!"
5,Good Value for Normal Bias Tape,"If you are going to be recording audiocassettes with normal bias tape I recommend using 60-Minute Tape over the 90-Minute variety. The 90-Minute tapes are made utilizing thinner mil (thickness) tape that is likely to jam in many audiocassette recorders and/or players. I rarely have this problem with Maxell 60-Minute Normal Bias tapes. As far as sound is concerned, if you record on an audiocassette recorder with Dolby HX-PRO these tapes sound exceptionally good. I seek out Maxell 60-Minute Normal Bias tapes when I go shopping because all varieties of audiocassettes are becoming harder to find. However, I personally like and use Maxell 60-Minute Normal Bias tapes because I am very pleased and impressed with the results."
4,Good for my lighting truss to transport,It would have been 5 stars except for the shipping. I ordered four and was sent four HUGE boxes stuffed with packing (?) when all four bags could have been consolidated into one package shipment. They are bags for goodness sakes! Why 12 feet of wasted packing paper x 4 boxes. I put all in one box to transport to my theatre location. It was all wasted energy and wasted material to have this shipped to me.The bags are great. The price was right. The energy exerted just to unpack the boxes and dispose of; a waste of time.
5,High Quality And Great Price,"I have two of these bags and use them to carry both a truss kit, as well as camera jib, and other gear. They are heavy duty and definitely priced right. These bags give a lot of bag for the buck. I definitely recommend them."
3,"Heavy, well padded","I don't use this for trusses, I use it to store my light stands, booms and other gear. It's very big and the exterior is well padded. The bag has just one large compartment and for me it works well. The handles on the bag are to thin, although they seem to be strong, and don't have a velcro closure to keep them together. I had one made for it by a friend. The other problem I had was one of the seams started to pull apart. This is because the handles are tacked in one place above the seams. If I was hauling my gear around a lot this bag may not take the stress. Since I don't it isn't a big problem for me but this company should address these problems and I think if they do it could easily get a higher rating."
1,Bag is too small for a 10 ft truss system,"I bought this to use with the On-stage 10 ft lighting truss system. If it were 6 inches longer it would be a three star bag. I ended up using it just to carry the tripods, and it is poorly designed even for that purpose. The carry straps are long enough that you could carry the case like a backpack, but the straps are so thin that they hurt horribly if you put them over your shoulders. Also the zipper is stops about 2 inches form the edge of each side. It should zip down the sides to allow the bag to lay flat for easier loading."
5,Need to purchase another one!!!,This is a heavy duty bag to truss or lighting stands or both. This is a product that could be used for not just lighting stands but for mic stands or collapsible trussing. I WILL purchase more of these!!
3,"durable bag, a lil roomy tho...","I bought this to hold my lighting tree (1 tripod, t-bar and side bars). Even with all of those in the bag, it's still got alot of room left. I suppose this good be a good thing for some people, but for me - it seems wasteful. The Ultimate stand bags have dividers built in, so stands don't rub and scratch each other during transport. Not this bag... they all live together in the bag...fyi.Good bag, just some issues."
2,Back Cover,"Rome was not man enough for one woman. Newspaper reporter, Lexie Templeton, didn't need to meet Rome Lockwood to know his type-a male chauvinist playboy with a different girl on his arm every night!Lexie's caustic comments to Shari Sullivan, the gossip columnist, hit the headlines, and Rome Lockwood came storming into the office looking for Lexie and revenge.With fire in his yes, Rome Lockwood challenged her to stand by her feminist views. And Lexie accepted the challenge, never dreaming that the sparks had only begun to fly..."
1,Waste of Money,"this book doesn't even deserve One star. If you want to see racism and terror, just look around you. Turn on the news and watch that. Read the paper. It's everywhere. This book just helps motivate people to do those things. If you think the beliefs in this book are true, you are a fool. Government was created to protect the weak and all it's other citizens. It was also threw cultural defussion that all this progress was made. Stop wasting your time with hate and go do something like get a job, go to school and learn something usefull. Stop reading trash."
3,"Fun book. And yes, I know it's racist.","... At the risk of offending everyone, I had fun reading thisbook. From the beginning when the Cohen bill (get it?) tries to takeaway everyone's guns to the execution scene where white women whoslept with black men get executed to the constant Jewbaiting, this isone very whacked book. It's like Red Dawn but without the veneer of --actually Red Dawn didn't have any veneer. Ok, it's like Red Dawnwithout Erin Gray to blow up anything.The Nazi propaganda getstedious, of course. The joy the narrator takes in assassination makesone hope that the author is under close surveillance. But the pacingthe plotting are pretty good. Usually when I read these fringeelements, I get the sense that I'm losing out on style in favor ofgetting something truly twisted. In this one, I'm kind of sad that thewriter takes himself seriously and really believes in the Nazicause. He could have written some great thrillers."
3,Interesting only because of it's story line,"The book is a blatant and unabashed piece of Nazi-esque propaganda. That being said, the storyline (a futuristic race war) is the book's best quality because hardly anyone has approached the subject. The book is quite unrealistic but it does need to be read for two reasons. Firstly, many crimes have been committed by those who wanted to immitate the book. Thus those who wish to understand these criminals should read the book. Secondly, there is a profound line written by Earl Turner stating (I'm paraphrasing) that he and his group would never have been able to make war with the System and ""undesirables"" had it not been for large scale gun control."
4,quit trying to be so politically correct!,"I have read this book, it isnt the greatest, but i kinda liked it. i dont think i am a racist person, but politically correct people would think so. It seems like there are more people hating this book for the message it portrays, because they have been trained in life to reject politically incorrect things. just because it was made by a racist man, dosent mean its any different from movies like american history x, and mississipi burning. I think people should stop trying to do what the government thinks is correct, and start trying to do things to help themselves."
1,Riveting? Ah...no...,"I started this read in order to learn more after watching a program on The History Channel. While it is very disturbing, and sometimes presents ideas that are seemingly relevant to current events, it is not that we'll-written and is a rather tedious read. It does use offensive language, but I didn't buy into that as the language did serve to define the main character. In my opinion, the book simply drones on and on and on, moving at a snails pace. I suppose the author could have been making a statement about the methodical pace of the books ""organization,"" but I'm not sympathic enough to the white supremist cause to find it worth the minutia. I'm 3/4 of the way through and not very motivated to finish. I think I'd rather go visit a synagogue with the time I'll save not completing this book."
5,mandatory reading ...,"If you read ""1984"" or ""Fahrenheit 451"" you will like this book. I think whether you are uplifted or insulted by the material it is good to read. I think you will not be bored by the content. Under 200 pages it is a fast read you will not forget. This book has influenced some of the country's most violent white revolutionaries and after reading it you will see why. This scenario is bound to happen in the USA and reading this book will definitly prepare you for it. A classic by a legendary 20th century revolutionary..."
1,Much Ado About Nothing,"Particularly timely after the Michigan Inbred Militia arrests, the Turner diaries are much less sinister, less titillating, less subversive, less well written than the scandalous hype surrounding it would indicate. More like a first try at novel writing that hasn't seen an editor's pen than a manifesto. Recommend a pass."
4,Interesting Eye Opener,"Andrew MacDonald presents an interesting fictional work of White patriotism in ""The Turner Diaries."" While I enjoyed much of the down to earth humor that MacDonald penned in TTD, I came away, after reading the Diaries, with the feeling of not being fully aware of a clear-cut agentship. I felt that TTD was not necessarily a Bible for patriots, but instead as a battle and reconnaissance manual. In the sense that it is a reconnaissance munual, plus a fictional work with much comic relief, one could use the old cliche and say that it is worth it's weight in gold. I tend to somewhat differ on that note; instead, I recommend furthing one's studies, of the issue, by reading a far better book entitled ""Nature's Eternal Religion,"" by Ben Klassen."
5,"If you wanna see how stupid the other side is, this is the Book!","Unmitigated BS from cover to cover. You've got Jews selling girls into sexual slavery, black rapists and criminals, gun nuts stockpilling for the impending race war, and a nuclear bomb dropped on Israel and China. It's a laugh riot from beginning to end. Now don't get me wrong, anyone who would read this book for anything other entertainment is a first rate wack job, but sane people might get a kick out of it if it doesn't freak them out too much. The book might be a bit scary if its ""characters"" actually possessed the intellect or the access to actually cause something like this to happen, but happily, they are all backwoods hilljacks from Deliverance and are about as ineffectual as gnats. Now if you'll excuse me, I have an international banking conspiracy to attend to..."
5,"Message, not the words...","Granted, I can see how someone would LOATHE this book. I myself only gave it a chance past the first few racial references because it came highly recommended. However, like most great works, it can be superimposed onto anything. There is no way a situation identical to this will happen with race wars and things such as that, but when you look at a government controlling it's people through fear to give up their firearms and accept national ID cards - basically, guilted into surrendering their freedoms because ""if you're not with us, then you're one of them"" - then you can see how this book is EXTREMEMLY relevant today.Read it with an open, but patriotic mind. Think of the values our countries were founded on - not of the politics of race - and realise that this book is important. The racist dribble contained in the book should be ignored as context - the world the character lives in should not."
3,An interesting glimpse,"I read this book because so much was made about it when Timothy McVey committed the Oklahoma City bombing. It gives an interesting glimpse into the mindset of racist radicals. The writing wasn't that great, however, I was disturbed to find that, at times, I was rooting for the protagonist. I feel a little more educated on how racist extremist groups think."
3,not bad...,"It's quite amazing that Turner Diaries and Camp of Saints (france) came out in the same year! Completely fascinating. Something was in the air.... William Pierce should not attempt love scenes - those segments of Turner Diaries didn't move along very well (laughably bad, in fact). Otherwise, vivid and full of action! Basically well-structured ""underdog"" plot -- Hollywood should have a look..."
2,Hyped Hatred,"I bought this book to see what the hype was all about. After reading Timothy McViegh's autobiography, I wanted to see if it was as powerful as it was touted. I found it poorly written, full of hate and racism. The only interesting part was in the begining when he writes about bombing the FBI headquarters. One can see the connection between the book and the bombing in Oklahoma City.Would I recommend this book? Certainly, if the purpose is to understand the enemy. It is said that in order to defeat the enemy one must learn to think like them. This book provides a powerful insight into the world of Racism. It is not an easy read, due to the writing and the subject matter. I gutted my way through it in one reading, just to finish it and get it over with."
1,Puerile nonsense,"I read this book cover-to-cover, in balls-aching detail, out of curiosity. It would be difficult to write a more contrived, improbable, unlikely story even if you tried really, really hard. The plot plods. I was bored senseless halfway through. The racist rhetoric became thoroughly inane after a while through constant repetition. Puerile nonsense at its (best/worst). Don't bother buying this book: read it online as there are several sites that make the text available."
4,"People, people, people; it's a novel.","Just read this a few weeks ago. No, it's not a literary classic and the writing isn't great and the book looks like a small press homebrew..... but, WOW, can this little thing stir up the controversy, and I'm guessing that was the idea. I found it entertaining and enlightening and a little far-fetched in several places. Although I don't agree with the politics and really don't believe we will see a race war any time soon, I still found it pretty darned scary. I'm betting on an Enron-inspired class war myself."
3,Turner,It was a scary book. It was eye opening for someone who doubts that a possible organization exists deep within our own society and how it could just erupt if today's safeguards are not in place. Life is scary as it is so let's live it that way.
4,A Interesting book and a little scary,"I Write this review as someone in the middle. Im not a nazi, or white supremacist who will shout how great it is. And im not a Scared liberal shouting how it is writen for idiots,by idiots and how you should not buy it. Im the adverage man. It was a good book...a little far out on the edge but good. The thing that Really worried me about this book was the base on reality it had. Im not saying its all true, but I was actually comparing it to things going on in todays world And sometimes it was Frightening. Dont judge it by what you think it is, judge it by what it is. At this point my original copy has changed hands 4x. It seems the people find it interesting enought to pass it on. Its not a jury,You dont have to pick a side like some would want. Read it,it will keep you interested"
1,Rubbish,It's so over the top in racism I felt guilty reading it. Frightning look into the mind of white supremacy
1,A Good Book For Paranoid Psychoes,"The long and the short of it: This book is certainly novel, but ultimately disgusting and unfortunately written by a nutcase.If you really want to get inside the messed up psyche of the laughably paranoid Neo-Nazi movement, read it. If not, it really has no other value."
1,What are The Two Previous Reviewers Smoking?!?,"That the previous reviewers, try to explain this book as possessing any relevence or, on the other hand, to excuse it as ""fiction"" is either naive and foolish or, most likely, devious of them.This book is nothing more than NAZI (and I use that term very deliberately) propaganda! The writer, William Pierce (aka Anrew MacDonald), led one of the most fanatical and extreme neo-nazi organizations in post-WWII America. The book is written with only one purpose in mind: To inflame disgruntled and insecure white men against everyone and everything that is not Western Indo-European pink-skinned white."
1,HORRIBLE,This book is just horrible. It should be baned. It talks about the killings of innocent people. I DO NOT suggest it at all.
2,Snore. Much ado about nothing.,"OK, I had to read it once I realized, while watching a Timothy McVeigh biography, that this book had been virtually banned by mainstream publishers and, until recently, was only available by self-publishers at gun shows. Now I like gun shows as much as the next guy, but this sophomoric attempt to ""awaken"" the white, male conservative (of which I am one) is almost comical. And completely improbable. For this to happen as it is laid out (and let's face it, many things are wrong in our country that need to be fixed) could not possibly happen as such. Nor should it. Still, if you want to read it just to say you did, by all means do so."
3,Interesting look into a worldview.,"As a fanatic conspiracy theorists he ignores and despises any other possible viewpoint, even when toying with basic human instincts like not wanting to kill children he shrugs them off for his ideals. Writing this can only be considered sadistic masturbation and fantasies of greatness from a paranoid nut who refuses to blur any line between his version of right and wrong even in making his characters believable. If you are not WS and think he is making a point that you agree with its probably just a superficial similarity to a few rational political positions. In reality its just that in his mind his views and his kind are absolute good, and all others are corrupting the world no rationality to it. Think this book is against oppression and big powerful government, look closer, killing and global domination for racial purity=good, killing and global domination containing ideas of equality=absolute evil.Still very entertaining and disturbing."
2,Had to see what it was all about.,"Had to check it out for all the furor over it , for the most part it is poorly written and not well thought out . If not for the government and Morris Dees and the SPLC it would have faded into the fringes to be fogotten . Though I do agree with the publishers comments the censorship is censorship no matter were it comes from and its pruposed reasoning."
3,Rather boring for my current taste.....,"I read this book several years ago, and I bought it recently because I thought I might enjoy reading it again. I guess I am not as ""into"" the whole radical drama anymore, as I did not even finish reading the book this time around. I will probably sell it on ebay and make a few dollars on it....or hold onto it and sell it in a few years when the government has banned such books!! Viva le Revolution!!"
5,A book of racial realism,"I have a real problem with this book... it is under read. For those of us who have had the chance to read this book we all know where this is going. The Turner Diaries illistrates the problems of an integrated society, however it offers a radical way of dealing with them. In vain of the govenment and many liberals, this book shows how a great nation can be reduced to nothing. By no means be a McVeigh, but understand that this book will captivate you and force you to realize problems in society now, and in the future. It is slandered by many, however the diaries can explain this and more. If you can find it(as it is not often on many bookshelves) by all means READ IT."
1,Review of Turner Diaries,"I have just finished reading this book. As I was reading it, I could not believe the vile content. I am very liberal in what I read and I would not ever suggest this book to anyone, except for someone that wants to find out what the thinking of hate groups. As an American, I was appalled with the scenario suggested in the novel. The only think I can say about this book, that the vile content of this book is equaled to Mein Kampf by Adolf Hitler. Most hate groups think Mein Kampf is a bible for their groups and The Turner Diaries extends the hate for these group.I wouold never, ever let a member of my family read this garbage and it still making me ill. I have removed it from my Kindle and my PC and it will never will be replaced on my computers. I think anyone with the smallest amount of education would find this book disgusting ."
5,Great Book,"I am not sure where all the negative commentary is coming from. The book certainly has a high shock factor and several of the scenes described within are disturbing but as a piece of fiction it is very good. This book was an ""optional read"" for the SCTY 488 at Embry Riddle Aeronautical University. The class discusses National Security and Terrorism. I wonder what the purpose of such a book would be for the class and I have come to the conclusion that it is designed to show how organizations gather support toward their cause. From the perspective of a student studying terrorism, I though the author did extremely well describing terrorist tactics. I found myself sympathyzing with the Organization at times.Again, it was a good read, a page turner in fact."
4,Surprising Piece of Work.....,"While this book is far from a literary classic, it is a rather fascinating read. I don't profess to be an extremist, but some of the things McDonald describes about the fall of our society ring eerily true."
2,Read Another Book,"I Consider myself a member of the ""gun Culture"" ,and i read this book out of curiosity due to all the hype surrounding it. Some of the authors insights into how our government is out of line are good, however he destroys that message with overt and inyour face racism. It's too bad there are people who believe this way. If you want to read a Better book read Unintended Consequences by John Ross. He is a great read w/out the racism and bigotry."
1,Racist garbage,"An unbeleivable tale of white supremacist racism, filled to the brink with moronic political views, laughable ideas about warfare, basic ballistic mistakes, and general idiocy.Worth reading to see how the racist nutbags actually think. It's not about separation. It's about mass slaughter of non-whites."
1,Only needed this book for a project on different ideologies,Very different outlook on life then your average person...not a happy book for sure. Historically significant maybe...kinda portrayed in such a biased and opinionated way that to some it'll feel unusual to read and maybe even uncomfortable.
3,The Turner Dairies,"Well written, subject matter would be considered a fantisyif the introduction hadn't indicated that the book hadbecome a ""handbook"" for the many anti-american racisitswe know are present in this country. Much of thewriting was particulaly ""scary"" other than the ""atomic""conclusion which was pretty far fetched."
2,Finally read it.,"After hearing about this book for several years, I finally decided to buy it and read it. Much like ""The Catcher and the Rye,"" the mystery surrounding this book was the factor that persuaded me to give it a read. I found the content and ideas to be very dangerous, and somewhat offensive. This is one of those books that I read simply out of curiosity, but would not read for recreation. I personally did not care for this book, but think that it is an important piece of literature as it reminded me of the value and meaning of the first amendment. If you have ""thin skin"", and are offended easily you may reconsider reading this book. I read a very wide variety of literature, and am rarely offended by content, but there were a few areas of this book that got to me a bit. As a student of psychology and law, I enjoy reading books that seem to stir emotions in people, I rank this book in the top 5 of the most questionable pieces of literature that I have ever read."
3,"Interesting theme, but not very well written","This book has a very impausible idea -- that one race would rise up and take control of not only this country, but the entire world. To exterminate, wholesale, races of people around the world is a very odd idea. But, keep in mind, this is a novel. The author, William L. Pierce, wrote this as his fantasy.One idea I found preposterous, having served in the military, was that the military (or at least, the white portion of it) would rise up and aid and abet a takeover of this country.As I mentioned in my title for this review, the work is not very well written. I'd heard about this book and wanted to check it out for myself. It could have done without the melodramatic touch of putting ""this is racist propaganda"" on the book cover. This isn't propaganda, it's a NOVEL. I have my opinion as to who would want to affix that kind of epithet, but that's not germane to this book review."
3,Apparition,"Very nice, not too much because I don't smell it later in the day, a nice soft good smelling product."
2,Can't compare to the ps1 version,"I am going to try to keep this review short and sweet (more like bittersweet) or just bitter like this game. I realize that coming from someone who has played most of the newer Choro Q series before this entry, my views are very biased but I am still going to give it a shot. This game has not aged well at all; the driving mechanics, graphics, and entertainment value are null but strangely enough, I found this game so bad that I could not stop playing. It was like I was trying to see how much of this game I could endure before I finally gave in to pursue something more entertaining. Given the small sum of money that I actually paid for this game, I would say it is a good value for a retro cartridge paperweight but this review is about the content inside of the cartridge and not the actual cartridge itself.Recommended for: People collecting N64 cartridges, children that enjoy racing games, and people collecting the games in the Choro Q series."
2,Mediocre,"This game is okay. It's not very exciting. The graphics aren't very good, and the cars start s-l-o-w. Come to think of it, the graphics aren't very good at all. The weapons and blowup scenes are kind of hokey. The music is sad. VERY lame. It sounds like a cell phone song. I was looking at this when it was 50 bucks, and I saw it two weeks later for 30, so I bought it. There's a reason the price dropped so fast. I do like the customizable cars, (paint, parts) and tracks, but the racing itself detracts from it. BUY MARIOKART. MUCH better. But I do like that noodle truck. -Mark"
2,Not for Me.,"It is difficult to write a review on a collection of writings. However, I simply could not get into this book. I can appreciate literature in just about any form, but it seemed to me that the majority of these essays were ill-tempered and complaintive in nature. If I want to find women who have such negative things to say about being a mother, I could go to any park, coffee shop, play group, or corporate building filled with females and simply ask. (Although, it probably wouldn't be in such a poetic form as many of these ladies had written.)If you are looking for women over the years who can commiserate with these feelings via beautiful wording, then maybe this book is for you. However, it isn't for me, personally."
5,"The Signature of God, The Handwriting of God","Next to the Holy Bible, I can recommend this book as one of the best that I have read. It shows that the historical events spoken of in the Word are actually events that took place. It gives physical proof to places and events that are spoken of in the Bible. Not only do you see the historical accuracy of the Word, but you see how God, in all ways, is more amazing and more worthy of our praise for the really incrediable things that He has done by the encoding of his words in the Bible text. If you love God and want to know more about Him OR If you have doubts as to who God is or His existance, this book is for you! No one will regret reading it."
2,The Andrews Sisters Sing the Andrews Sisters,"Bottom line: This collection is largely re-recordings of the Andrews Sisters' hits from the 1940s, re-done in the 1950s. Some of the oldies (""Shoo-Shoo Baby"" and ""Well All Right"", for example) benefit from tight studio band arrangements and improved recording techniques, but most do not. Other selections reflect Capitol's inexplicable experiments in turning this swingin'est of sister acts into a country (""Crazy Arms"") or gospel (""By His Word"") group -- without much success. I bought this CD because the Capitol recording of ""Hold Tight"" was the first Andrews Sisters record I ever heard; so it has a place in my childhood memories, and I wanted to have it. But unless you're an Andrews completist, I'd opt for the original 1940s recordings and pass this collection right by."
4,3 Previously unreleased songs...a must for any fan,"These songs were all recorded in 1956 through 1958. While maybe not as good as the original recordings of the same songs done a decade or so earlier, they are still The Andrews Sisters, and they still have the wonderful harmonies, and this cd is certainly worth owning and listening to. The 16 page booklet has a 5 page essay, and plenty of photos. There are also 3 songs that are previously unreleased which make this cd a must for any true fan."
5,Thank you,Thank you so much for getting it to me so fast. We got to watch it on New Years! Thank you. I love Peanuts holiday movies
3,A good but not great way to ring in the new year,"By the 1980's, Charlie Brown's friends had lightend up on him a bit, but so had the dramatic texture of the stories. This special is filled with cute, if not too memorable, songs and dances as the friends gather for an unchaperoned NYE party. It is problematic that Charlie Brown is the ONLY one with homework. Still, it's nice to start the new year with familiar faces."
3,Brannigan doesn't deliver as one of Duke's finest,"Believe it or not, John Wayne once turned down the role of 'Dirty Harry Callahan' (go ahead, make my day, pilgrim). Now, he tries to make up for that [mistake?] in the movie Brannigan. Brannigan is surprisingly a reworking of the 60's Clint Eastwood movie Coogan's Bluff (how's that for coincidence). Wayne is the title character: a brash, but effective, Chicago cop whose arch enemy (John Vernon)has escaped the states to London. Wayne(and his reliable Colt.45 sixshooter)are sent after him. The Duke tries hard to shed that cowboy image, but it resurrects itself in several scenes. It helps that Wayne is surrounded by a capable supporting cast in Sir Richard Attenborough, Mel Ferrer, and John Vernon. It also serves the film well that most of it is shot in and around London, England. Alas, Brannigan is too long and too predictable to be considered among The Duke's finest films."
1,brannigan,"will not work on a dvd player that i've been able to try it with, made for use with something else."
2,Likeable but minor,"""Brannigan"" is better than average latter-day Wayne in that the film doesn't moralize and offers us the Duke in an offbeat locale (London)...on the other hand, the plot is dull and stretched out, and the barroom brawl is terrible (Wayne's up to it, but the British stuntmen's attempts to approximate an American setpiece fall ridiculously flat). But the film is no embarrasment, and any Wayne fan might find this a pleasant surprise."
1,Deceptive advertisement,"I have purchased and rented many films from Amazon and those films that are NOT for the US (region I) are clearly indicated so in the body of the movie description. I purchased Brannigan and received an unusuable region DVD. I checked and found that the NOT FOR THE USA notice was at the extreme bottom of the description in small letters. I DO NOT APPRECIATE SUCH DECEPTIVE PRACTICES....UNPLAYABLE DVD's IN USA SHOULD BE BOLDY AND CLEARLY NOTED IN THE BODY OF THE ADD! Needless to say, the Brannigan DVD hit the trash bin.....HOW SO VERY SAD!"
4,John Wayne being John Wayne.,A lot of fun to watch. If your kids have never seen the Duke.This is a good one to start them on. No one can play parts likethese better than John Wayne. Great addition the my John Waynelibrary.
4,New cop movie ('75) with The Duke in shoot-out in merry old England!,"Second straight hit for 'TheDuke' in cop actioner. Toobad he was large and near theend of his career. Too bad healso turned down Dirty Harryfour years earlier. Twomore movies to go in hisgreat career and life. R.I.P.,Mr. movie legend!"
4,Let the Funk and Neo-Soul party begin,Great Music... The CD covers Raphael's Toni Tone Tony days and some of his awesome solo work. If you're a fan of either this disk is a great addition to your music collection. The live setting bring more some new energy to music that I already enjoyed.
4,Lovin every minute of it,"Raphael Saadiq has such a unique voice. It is cool, mello, smooth, and unforgettable. As soon as I got this CD I popped it into the car CD player and went straight to ""ALL I ASK OF YOU"" from the Higher learning movie. I then went to ""Anniversary"" and then from there I hit every track and every tune. Hearing this CD reminds me how much I miss the unique sound of the Tonys. The only problem I have with this CD was that listening to it made me wish I could have been at the House of Blues to hear it live."
1,"first half pretty good, but then...","This book really started out pretty good, nicely paced to our dawning understanding of an extraterrestrial colony and how their society developed, but then devolves into a shuddering mass of pseudo-cosmic poop at the end (actually, like the whole final third). It's very unsatisfying when an author schemes up a story that culminates in situations-that-cannot-be-described, and we the readers are left holding the bag of whatever-it-is. Fortunately Watson's ""Mockymen"" is much more even."
3,Crowded House go glossy,"The best thing about Woodface is that Neil and Tim Finn collaborated to produce some wonderfully enduring songs. The problem is the album is a mish-mash of edgy Crowded House tunes and slickly produced Finn Brothers tunes. It's not sure what it wants to be, and, therefore lacks the coherence of the other Crowded House albums. Still, it beats most anything else out there, so it's a good buy."
4,The Finn Brothers Make Beautiful Music Together!!,"Once you skip past ""Chocolate Cake"" (every master songwriter is entitled to his 'what were they thinking' song), this baby washes over you like a gentle wave. ""It's Only Natural"" shows that no one harmonizes like the Finns (one of Neil's best songs). This is followed by gems too numerous to mention (""Fall at Your Feet,"" ""Four Seasons in One Day,"" etc). Neil's great line in ""She Goes On"" ""We owe it all to Frank Sinatra/ his song was playing as we walked into the room"" shows us why he is one of our best (and most unappreciated) songwriters. Sadly, the harmonies with Tim only lasted one album, but thankfully Crowded House still had one excellent album left in them (""Together Alone"")."
3,Sheen & Shine,"Crowded House understand the craft of songwriting and record-making in a way miles beyond most of their generation. The first three tracks on this LP, along with ""Four Seasons In One Day,"" are as well-crafted as you'll ever hear.But it's the band's dependence on craft that keeps this LP from being a great one. There is a self-conciousness here that is hard to get past. The message that these are men at work, crafting product, honing their craft, is never overcome by any kind of passion or exhuberence.This is XTC with the fun surgically removed. They don't sound like they particularly enjoy what they're doing.It's their job."
5,Love it! Love it! Love it!!! (MIM Stratocaster),What an upgrade! my guitar looks amazing and the sustain has increased as well. I must confess I've never had a problem with the Fender original vintage saddles breaking my strings but they corroded pretty quickly though. Highly recommend these saddles! Perfect fit!
4,This is funny if not taken seriously,"I really enjoyed this movie. It had very funny parts in it. When I first saw this at age 15, I was a little freaked out about some parts. The entire movies teaches you that it is ok to laugh at dumb jokes. If you try to take this movie seriously, it just ruins the fact that they are trying to have fun with it. Just get a group of friends together and enjoy. The inside jokes that you will gather are great memories.Elbow Skin!!!!(watch the movie)"
4,100 Reasons to laugh,"This is my favorite college/teen film. It doesn't have a sappy ""learned my lesson ending"". Just good fun. Jonathan Tucker does a great job detailing all the girls. They all have their own funny quirks. This is a great movie to watch with a mate. It's not a chick flick, but it's not a man movie either. There's a happy medium."
5,Buy it now!,"This is a movie that will make you think about the long war of men and women, and actually, sorry guys, have you take the womans side, this movie will enspire you no matter what life you are living. And it doesnt stop there, it has lots of laughs, great acting, and even some surprises. Its mostly about a guy who finds his first one night stand and falls in love. But the only bad thing is that he has no idea who she is, so he does insane, idiotic, and brave things to find his one true love. But does she want him?"
5,great movie,This flick came very fast and in great condition. I was happy to find such a rare and funny title still out there
2,Not bad but not good either,"Geeky Matthew (John tucker) loses his virginity screwing some cooze during a blackout, the next morning she's nowhere to be found. So immediately falling in love with her, he goes on a quest to find this nameless girl who could be any of the 100 girls whom live in the dormitory. His roommate, Rod (James DeBello, better know for his part in the MUCH better Detroit Rock City) is there to act as a soundboard which Mat gets to tell his ideas too (and adds to the sophomoric teen comedy humor quota obviously). The film isn't that bad for a teen comedy, if you can get past the abundant pitiful similes, metaphors and the fact that Tucker doesn't really have the look to really pull off the shenanigans this movie wants us to readily believe. A couple of enormous hurdles indeed. it's not bad, but there are so many worthier teen comedies out there."
2,100 girls,"Alright so 100 girls is essentially a romantic comedy set in college from a guy's point of view. The male protagonist spends the film searching for a mystery girl he copulated with on an elevator during a power outage and comedy ensues, or something like that. My problem with the film is that it is filled with little subplots that feel non sequitur and like interruptions to the main story line rather than being effectively interwoven with the rest of the plot. Additionally this is an R rated film and it has very strong sexual content, sometimes I felt the nudity and sexual elements were unwarranted. That said there were some laughs to be had and it wasn't a complete waste of time, just be aware going into this that it's not a Great film, it's a raunchy ""thrown together"" college romantic comedy."
4,Jonathan Tucker your the man,"Young Jonathan tucker or Tommy Donnelly for all you cheated, morbidly depressed and disapointed Black Donnellys fans. this is a weird but funny flick. i love it and if you don't... hell your out 10 bucks"
1,total garbage,"This movie is total garbage. The guy in it talks through the whole movie, talk, talk, talk, as bad as any soap opera. And what kind of a guy does all this talking? He dresses up like a girl and his roommate hits on him. Need I say more? It should say 101 girls because he is one. There are a couple of scenes where the girls say something interesting, but it is somehow done is a very unexciting way. There is nothing exciting about this movie at all. If you liked girls before seeing this soap opera you would be bored with them afterward. And then it might take a while before you get your head back to normal."
4,For the youth of America and the young at heart,"I bought this movie strictly off a Amazon review. I am glad I watched it, but I do wish I'd seen it as a teenager! This movie is one of those that does a lot of explaining of the male psyche. It could've saved me some growing pains! It is a little to kiddish for an adult."
3,Misleading? In a good way...,"Don't expect to see 100 actual girls in this movie...I stumbled across this movie when my friends and I went to the movie store, and we rented it. Suprisingly it was good enough for me to purchase on here. 100 Girls is about a man's search for a ""mysterious"" girl he has an ""experience"" with in a dark elevator. Basically, the flick revolves around him finding her. Amidst the twists and turns, he meets some interesting people. Its a good movie, I'd recommend renting it before buying it."
4,SEXFAIR FOR A NEW GENERATION,"I hadn't heard of ""100 GIRLS"" before it appeared on the shelf at my local video store. Barely promoted. Just as Porky's had been.It wasn't a great movie, but of all the bubble gum teens movie that keep popping up in movie theatres, this one exceeds them because it holds no punches. They talk about anything and everything. Sex IS frank and honest, just like this movie.A beautiful cast of women of all kinds, including: Katherine Heigl, Emmanuelle Chriqui, Larisa Oleynik, Jaime Pressly, Marissa Ribisi, Aimee Graham, Kristen Herold and Kristina Anapau. Good comedic overtones and an intriging story that isn't all that predictable.The only thing that bothered me in the movie was the voice-over by Jonathan Tucker. It wasn't a bad job or a bad voice-over, but at times it was kindof corny.Other than that, an enjoyable movie to watch, and if I had any suggestions to improve it, it would've been even dirtier."
4,Old-fashioned but enjoyable,"I just picked up a beautiful old copy of this at Moe's books in Berkeley. It dates from the early fifties. I don't know if this Chicago edition is simply a reprint, but I am finding it to be a throroughly well-written and enjoyable book. At times it simplifies and idealizes where perhaps a contemporary academic account might be more cautious, but this gives it a certain romance that accords with the subject matter."
3,"Informative, but poorly written","Quite frankly, I expected more from a book that the University of Chicago Press ventured to publish. A nice summary but you'd swear that the author's first language wasn't English."
4,being...,"...one of the best cocteau twins albums, the drum-production on this album turns me off sometimes. it`s too heavy and loud. if only Treasure and Blue Bell Knoll could have met half way produtionwise, they both would definately gain quality. but that`s just me. long live the twins or should i say tripplets."
1,Ugh!!,"I stumbled across this CD when I was looking for an Enya-like artist and subsequently bought this CD solely based on other reviews. What a mistake.The vocal aren't ethereal and the instrumentals are grating. The worst part is the extensive use of echo and reverb. I don't know who mixed this album or who approved its use but I am sure they were stoned out of their mind at the time. If I had to describe it, I would say it is a ""punk"" version of an Enya wannabe or some other untalented artist, mastered by some guy who passed out on the effects console.I can't recommend it to anyone, unless maybe you sniff paint fumes for a living."
5,quintessential ethereal music,"Nobody's reviewed this ""treasure"" yet? The CT's best, ever. Parts of it make me feel like I'm in a cathedral, other parts like I'm alone in the dark. There's a great range of tone here, from loud and brusque to whispers and sea sounds. I'm sure whomever buys this CT album would want to buy more!"
4,The voice of angels,"I have been a fan of goth and ambient music for quite a long time. I recently got VH1 classic on cable, and one of the first bands I saw was The Cocteau Twins. At first I thought that it was Mazzy Star, but then I realized that this was older and purely magical. The first album I bought of theirs was Treasure. Not only is the album beautiful, but from the melodies, you can hear that they were infulence by The Cure, and Bauhus. It also shows that you don't need lyrics to be drawn to good music."
4,Good album.,This is one of the Cocteaux Twins' better albums. It is about 45 minutes long and has an array of songs that typify their various high quality production techniques that occur on their different albums. I highly recommend it for fans old and new of the Cocteaux Twins.
5,Remastered,"The clarity and balance in this remaster is worth replacing your old copy. I was not sure after reading other reviews, but rest assured you will have a new reason to play these albums over and over."
2,Disappointed,"I bought this ""sound-unheard"" based on the glowing reviews, and now I wish I'd downloaded some MPEG samples from Napster before I bought it. ""Pandora"" is the only selection I care for, and even that is only so-so.The problem with online reviews is that they tend to be dominated by hardcore fans, who will of course tend to praise the CD to the sky. No accounting for taste I guess...if you don't yet own any Cocteau Twins, Heaven or Las Vegas might be a surer bet for your first Twins CD."
3,Raw like sushi!,"Eric Martin is definitely one of the greatest singers of all time but Destroy All Monsters is an average release by his high standards. The music is pretty basic with very little production and a very live feel throughout. Eric Martin described the style as distorted pop and I guess that's a good description as the songs are simple power pop tunes that you might hear by a band in any local bar - with a great singer that is! Destroy All Monsters isn't a bad album it's just that there's not really any memorable songs that make you want to press repeat and it's about as far away from Mr Big as you can get while staying within the world of rock. Eric Martin's vocal style is so good that it makes the album listenable for a die hard fan like me but Destroy All Monsters, despite being a fun sounding album, is one that I can only recommend to Eric Martin completists."
2,Not reliable enough,"As mentioned by others, the plastic base of the cutter assembly started cracking on mine. I was thinking of replacing it when the glass jar broke and figured it was time to buy a new blender. I barely used this blender and never used it to blend ice, and it sounds it was a wise decision. The food blended in there was not smooth, unlike the one from my new Cuisinart. I too though that Black & Decker was a brand representing good manufacturing and solid long-lasting products, but I guess it is no longer true."
1,Never worked,"Wedding gift...motor worked, but the gear that turns the blades never did. I'm a raging alcoholic and I need my frozen margarita now! And please, no salt this time. You savvy? Buy the cheap Walmart blender or just drink stuff on the rocks. I need a drink. See you in Hades."
2,Get something that lasts...,"It was a wedding gift less than three years ago. I really didn't use it very much at all. I was making fruit smoothies, and an ice cube must have busted the spinner thing at the bottom (which, of course, cannot be replaced). It's not part of the actual pitcher, it's the stupid plastic part that's supposed to be attached to the motor. Yeah, not anymore! Thanks a lot Black and Decker! I won't be looking highly at your products anymore. You're just loosing customers. Stop making crap."
1,I was fooled by Black & Decker's formerly good name,"The plastic collar broke after a dozen uses (nothing strenuous) , and the little replacement part cost half the full blender price. (I now see from other reviewers that Black & Decker has outsourced its appliance manufacturing to a Chinese sweatshop, so I will know in future not to trust their brand for anything.)"
2,Lasted a year and a half...,"I purchased this blender to make protein smoothies. Worked great for about 6 months, and then sometimes out of the blue, if I left it plugged in it would start running by itself in the middle of the night...very weird. So I just started unplugging it every time I after I used it. Then, after a year and a half, similar to other reviewers, it got a funny smell one day and just quit on me. In my opinion, a year and a half isnt long enough for a $40-50 blender to last...heck, I have had $25 blenders that lasted me 3-4 years before!"
1,Piece of Crap,"I purchased this blender for mixing protein shakes. The plastic part that interfaces the drive shaft with the impeller unit broke after several uses. Customer service at Black and Decker, nor their affiliates, carry the needed replacement part. Now I have a $35.00 paperweight.When I look back on my past Black and Decker purchases, I have found them, overall, to be substandard in performance and longevity. I usually bought them because of price. I am done with B&D;."
1,"This blender is a scary, safety threat","The scary part is to find the blender running unattended without anyone turning it on. We've owned this blender for perhaps two years, using it for a variety of food and drink preparation purposes, but not for crushing ice. Two weeks ago I was home alone and came downstairs to open the door for my wife, only to hear a loud whirring sound in the kitchen. Went in and found the blender running. I was unable to turn it off. The buttons were non-responsive. I had to unplug it to get to stop. The jar was tilted and the jar blade holder had ground itself into small pieces. Eventually this was going to lead to a fire. All I could think about was how close we may have come to our house burning down had we been away. It is outrageous that such a dangerous product is allowed to remain on the market."
1,Garbage,"I bought this blender from Target less than 3 months ago and didn't check any reviews on it beforehand (major mistake). Had I seen these reviews I would've never wasted my money or time. The first thing wrong with it was that while making my morning and evening smoothies (fruit, ice, orange juice) I would wind up w/ a smoothie with ice chunks in it. No matter how much I blended, there were always ice chunks. And because the pouring lip is not angled, but straight---juice falls and slides down the front of the cup when pouring. The final and last straw came yesterday morning. Attempted to make my usual morning smoothie, pressed the blend button and walked away. Within seconds, I heard the loudest, chugging, sputtering & splittering noise. When I rushed to the kitchen I saw half crushed smoothie & juice all over the kitchen counter & walls along w/ black oil. The blender basically exploded and was toast. I pulled the plug on it and tossed it in the garbage. Do not waste your money."
1,Terrible blender,"Got it about 4 years ago for a wedding gift. The motor burned out after only a few months of light use. Took it back and got a replacement. About 6 months later, it broke again and we took it back. Finally, about a year ago, the blade broke on it. Got a replacement blade and finally just last week the blade broke again. These blenders are crap. Save your money and buy something better."
1,Piece of CRAP!!!!!,"I bought this blender (B&D; BL900) today (2/5/09) because it was on sale atTarget. I took it out of the box, washed the jar, inserted a cup of grapes, half cup of pineapple chunks, an avacado, half cup of water andsome ice. 10 seconds into blending the motor cuts out and an LED on the front of the blender starts blinking - gotta pull out the instruction manual. Oh, it's the ""intelligent fuse"" feature!! So I unplug the blender for about 5 minutes to let the motor cool, plug it back in and in 10 more seconds it does it again. What a POS!!! You know B&D;, you wouldn't need to add this ""intelligent fuse"" to your blenders if you had intelligent employees to design quality motors. It's back in the box for a return. That's it for me - no more Black & Decker appliances!!!"
1,Terrible blender,DO NOT buy it!!!I used few times when the rubber ring broken while blending a smoothie.I spent more money on Shipping than the part itself.Today I tried to use it and did not turn on at all. The motor stoped with no apparently reason.I can only image the cost to fix it. Not worth!!!
1,Low Reliability and Poor Workmanship,"We owned this blender for about 3 years and only got to use it about 6 times before it broke down completely. I contacted Black and Decker and was disappointed when they told me that the blender was no longer covered under warranty and that I would have to purchase a new one. They also had to do a recall as the blender blades were breaking off during regular use.If you have the opportunity, I highly suggest avoiding this product. I was truly disappointed by Black and Decker's response (since the blender was clearly either defective or very poorly manufactured) and the product itself is unreliable. Save the trouble and buy a quality product that will work consistently and last for several years."
1,Loud and lousy,"It's attractive. That's all. We bought this because we needed a blender that could make smoothies. It's very loud, the lid must be pried open and shut, it's HEAVY and the ice crushing is poor. It will leave uncrushed ice unless you blend for almost 2 minutes. I replaced this with an OSTERIZER 10 speed. The Osterizer is light weight, less noisy, the lid is easy to pull on and off and it makes a perfect smoothy in 30 seconds or less...night and day difference."
1,piece of junk,"Bought this blender because it rated high on Consumer Reports. I used it daily for 6 months to make smoothies, but heaven forbid I make a daquiri! The cheap thing just started smoking and the motor burnt out in the middle of a party I was hosting.So, I Called Black & Decker to cash in on the warrenty, but they would only replace it with a blender that was of lesser value. After insisting that I deserved something of EQUAL value, I got them to send me a FREE 4-slice toaster to make up for the difference, and my trouble. : )WAIT, THERE'S MORE! Last week, while trying to make some punch the replacement B&D; blender burnt out trying to blend thawed frozen concentrate juices and strawberries...Black & Decker: This invention has been around for 40+ years, why makes it so difficult to make one that lasts? Stick to power tools, and get out of my kitchen."
1,Died after 5 uses,"This blender looks great and seems to be well made. I thought the power was sufficient until on the 5th use, I decided to make my smoothie a little thicker (slightly less milk). It started well but after about 20 seconds it sounded like it was struggling. I stopped it and manually stirred it to push down the couple of chunks of frozen peach still at the top. It stirred easily and didn't seem very thick to me. I started out on high again and 10 seconds later it burnt-out. Clearly, I need way more power for even slightly thick drinks. Now, I am looking at the Blend-Tec's and Vita-Mix's but they are $350+ blenders that will turn chunks of wood into sawdust."
1,Don't buy unless you don't intend to use!,"I purchased this item 30 days ago at a local store. After using it half a dozen times for smoothies (something a 550 watt motor should easily be able to handle) the motor stopped working. I exchanged it at the store feeling that I had just received a defective product. I used the new one 1 time...the motor died. Ridiculous. Needless to say, I returned it for a full refund. I won't be buying a black & decker blender ever again!"
2,"Looks Great, but Might Not Last","Seemed like a great buy -- heavy stainless base and a thick glass container. Worked for several months making smoothies; then the blade ""ate"" the gasket. We ordered a new gasket (took 6 weeks to come) and all was well again for a couple of months. Then the plastic base for the blade cracked. Other reviews indicate the current model has been revised (ours was purchased for Christmas 2004). Hopefully the weak blade and plastic mounting have been improved. But my advice would be to give this Chinese import a pass."
1,Extremely DIsappointed,"After owning this blender for less than one year and less than five uses, I pulled it out to use and it would not run.I called B&D; customer service- don't bother. The wait was incredibly long and the customer service poor.Save your money and your time. Do not buy a Black and Decker blender."
1,The motor died in 1 year and 3 months,"I bought this blender in August 2006, though not from Amazon. It worked very well for one year and 3 months. One day I made some paste. It worked fine. I turned it off. Five minutes later, I wanted to make another paste. But the motor just won't start. Before I bought this blender I had an Oster blender, which had lasted for 20 years. The oster's motor is still running, but it does not move the blades. I think it just needed new blades. But I thought it will be hard to find the blades for sucj=h an old model.I guess I should have just bought another Oster blender."
4,"A Good ""Casual Use"" Blender","I've had this blender for a while, and I still like it. After reading some other reviews, I just have this to add: you get what you pay for. If you want a blender for heavy daily use, then invest in something more expensive with heavy duty parts. I got this blender because I was moving into a new flat and needed one. I use it maybe a few times a month to make margaritas, salsa, or the occasional smoothie. I've never had a problem with it. The stainless steel construction has held up better than my older plastic blender ever did. The touch pad is wonderful because I don't have to scrub out gunk from button casings. So if you need a blender for casual use that looks nice on a counter-top, then this is a really good pickup. If you need to crush ice on a daily basis, upgrade to an 80 dollar blender."
3,Good blender for value,"I did a good bit of research before buying this blender and am very pleased with what I got. I use it primarily to make smoothies, almost daily and sometimes to blend a soup or something. It is easy to use, looks nice, easy to clean, it blends fruit and other ""soft"" foods easily. It doesn't always do a great job crushing ice. There are other blenders that can do ever trick in the book but I just wanted something basic. I bought this on sale at Target for $30. I would definitely recommend this blender."
4,A positive review,"My experience with this blender has been quite the opposite of the other reviewers. Call it a fluke, but I have had fine experiences with ice, frozen and fresh fruits and vegetables. Admittedly, there might be an occasional one or two small chunks of something, but it is minor in comparison to the last blender I owned. Of course, people blend things differently. I always put my solids in first, with the hardest, largest, and chunkiest on the bottom, then add liquids, etc.Okay, one of the things I REALLY like about this B&D; blender (other than the attractive red color) is the automatic shut-off feature. I rarely stop the machine manually. Perhaps that's why my items are usually thoroughly blended in this machine.The only reason I gave a rating of 4-stars is because I have not owned many blenders - only three which includes our new B&D.; I am sure the high-end blenders leave this model in the dust. For simple folks like me, however, this one works great."
1,lemon,this is the lemon of all blenders. it broke on its first use after about twenty minutes. it is a piece of crap that i would not suggest even in the most dire of circumstances (ie blending up your spouse's remains).avoid this blender.
1,Strike three. Don't buy this blender.,I have bought this same blender 3 times. The first time one of the plastic parts broke but I gave the brand the benefit of the doubt and tried it again. The second time the motor burned up. They improved the blender so the motor turns off if the blades get jammed. So I bought it again and the bolt holding the blades eventually striped itself down. Each time the blender broke within a year. I've never buying this brand again.
1,Pours horrbly,While the blender seems to blend nicely it is impossible to pur anything out of the pitcher without making a mess.
1,junk,"Mine died today while trying to make a fruit smoothy with ice. It made one batch ok, 2nd batch it died. no real warning, slowed down and died. Lites turn on and make a click noise when you press them, but thats it. Stupid. No device like this should die, it should turn off automatically if its over loaded or over heated. Can I do anything with it now? Looks like new."
1,Not worth it.,"My wife bought this blender because it was red. I make smoothies using frozen fruit a couple of times a week. It worked for about a year until this morning when the bottom screw stripped, making an awful sound and smell. I found an old Oster blender in the cabinet and finished blending. I had previously had nothing to compare the Black and Decker to, but the Oster blended much faster. I guess I got my money's worth from the Black and Decker, $50 for a year of smoothies, but after seeing what the Oster can do...don't buy this blender."
1,Horrible Piece of Machinery,"I have had two Black&Decker blenders. Both of them have died on me. This particular model ran for about 4 months of regular use. The other one, which I was told was a better model, BL14500 series, died on me after 5 uses. After my experience, I strongly believe B&D blennders simply suck. Their motors have extremely poor life. I wudn't suggest buying them even on sale. If you just have to buy it inspite of all my warning, please choose one with mechanical buttons rather than the touch pad. The electrical connections in the touch pad are so bad that the blender starts blending abt 10 minutes after you press the button. The only adjective that fits this machine is HORRIBLE."
2,Worked great then NOTHING,"I agree that the blender looks great and it did a good job blending for the first few months. However, it then would only work on the pulse setting and now NOTHING! Very disappointing. By the way, I was only using it for smoothies and margaritas so I don't believe it was due to my working it too hard."
2,Awful Blender,"I had this blender for less than four months, and it failed to make smoothies. One of the blades busted and the drink started leaking out of the back.I didn't even put frozen fruits in at first. I put in carrot juice and a banana and then the frozen fruits and the blender couldn't handle that.The only reason I gave it two stars, is: it's good if you use it once or twice a month and need something cheap with a black, chrome look, but if you're like me and make smoothies 3-4 times a week, spend more and stay away from Black & Decker."
2,Electrical Malfunction,"This was a decent blender while it lasted. Crushes/blends ice and frozen fruits fairly well.One night, I heard a loud noise that I thought was the vacuum, only I knew that couldn't be it because my roommate never vacuums. I went to check it out, and it was the blender... started up by itself! I begun to believe in ghosts, but thought more likely it was a problem with the blender. I tried to get used to just keeping it unplugged.However, after about a year, the blender has become completely useless due to more electrical malfunction. The buttons don't do what they're supposed to do, sometimes I can't get it to run at all. I will look elsewhere for my next blender."
1,Back to Walmart we go,"This Blender looks Great in our all Stainless Steel Kitchen, However after 15 seconds the motor burnt out making while attempting to make a Long island drink."
4,Good Choice,"I love this blender! I bought it about eight months ago. I basically got it because I liked the way it looks and it was a good price. I haven't had any problems at all and I've made all kinds of shakes, smoothies, margaritas, etc. I thought I'd post a review since so many of them were negative. I've been very pleased with mine!"
2,The glass jar outlasted the base/motor,"I used this blender once a month for about 6 months before I started using it weekly to blend cooked oatmeal with milk and frozen bananas. It never seemed to blend well on its own - I had to stop it and mix the ingredients at the bottom with a spoon to get a smooth consistency. After about 50 uses, it died while pureeing cooked veggies and small pieces of overcooked meat.Now I have a jar that feels like it could survive a 2 story drop and a dead motor. Skip this item"
1,Defective Design,"If ice is used in this blender, the plastic housing which encases the blade will crack causing contents of blender to leak everywhere. What a mess! Blade housing can be replaced for $5 - $10, but will simply break again unless you restrict your use to the softest of ingredients."
4,Not bad if not using to crush ice,"I used this blender for a little over 3years. It worked great for me, as I did not crush any ice in it. I used it to puree veggies, cooked lentils and milk shakes. I was surprised to see so many 1-star reviews.It looks great with the steel base and heavy glass jar, purees in no time. And yes, a blender should solve the purpose of making smoothies, which I never made with this one. It served me more worth than what I paid.My jar cracked today due to temperature variation. I pureed hot lentils and then filled it with water immediately...A BIG MISTAKE, so now I am here looking for a replacement jar. But I guess, its better to buy another blender instead of a replacement jar."
4,Long life for blender un $50!,I received this blender as a bridal shower gift in 2004. It has been fabulous- no issues for 6 years. We use it for smoothies and it works great!
1,Blade broke while making smoothie.,"This blender never did what it was designed to do...blend. Ice and anything remotely solid would get stuck in the upper portion of the jar while the blade spun freely underneath. I would often have to stop, remove the jar, and shake it around until the clog released. Today while making a strawberry banana smoothie, one of the blades broke off into the shake. Terrible blender with a poor design."
5,Great allergy product!,"I've been using this product for many months and am very happy with it. I recently stopped taking OTC products and this is phenominal! I had post nasal drip, red eyes, sneezing, itching, you name it. Allergic to everything. This has been lovely. I added Eyebright and am doing great!"
4,What's been missing from Christmas,There was a time television Christmas specials and yearly Christmas episodes dominated the TV schedule in December. Those days are sadly gone. Most of the great entertainers who delivered yuletide fun have passed on. Red Skelton was a fixture on TV during the 50s and 60s. This 3 DVD set provides Skelton fans with some great Christmas bits and some complete Christmas episodes from Red. If you're looking for some laughs and feeling a bit nostalgic you won't go wrong giving this set a view over the holidays.
2,Very disappointed,"Growing up, I absolutely loved Red Skelton. So when I saw these DVD's, I could hardly wait to order and receive them. What a disappointment. These DVD's contain very poor picture and color quality. Because I've opened the package, I cannot return them..... take my word for it......save your money!!!!!"
2,Poor Video Quality,I was anxious to see the reruns of these classic holiday episodes only to be utterly disgusted with the video quality. It looks like someone took a camcorder and just recorded it from a tv screen. Save your money because the poor video quality will ruin your enjoyment. I wish I could find these shows from a company that actually cares about preserving the video integrity of this great classic tv show.
3,Not as good as PC version,"Let me start out by saying that I am a huge Civilization fan...but....the Playstation version does not hold a candle to the PC version. The PS screen is cloudy and difficult to see, especially your own cities growth numbers. It's difficult to determine whose winning a battle as the stamina bar is impossible to see. My absolute biggest problem w/ the PS version is not having ""auto"" control over settlers. On the PC game you can set settlers to auto so they go around building roads and mining etc.. You have to do it all yourself on playstation. Do you know how boring it is to build 5,000 roads w/ 20 settlers?? Some people want to micromanage every aspect, but there is zero strategy to be gained from controlling settlers yourself, zero. Why take this option away? I think this explains why they never made another version for the playstation. Civilization is a game that apparently must be played on a computer."
2,Fun But Gets Boring,"The game is great from the start, but has short-lived replay fun. The characters that you interact with (your advisors) are fun to see and listen to, especially the Elvis character. It is also fun to see how they evolve over the years. But game play is slow between years and can even put you to sleep at times. The graphics are not all that great either. But if you are a fan of Civilization you will enjoy this version (at least for a little while.)"
2,Definitley an Intelligent game - but painfully slow moving,"This is not a game for the impacient. Normally, If I dig into a game I know will take a long time solve, it has to motivate me with an interesting story line, music and or graphics (an RPG like FFVII or VIII for instance) However, If you are interested in a complex and super challenging strategy game, this may be for you. Too bad they never made Age of the Empires for PSX, and warcraft psx is really hard to find!!"
1,... on this,you build cities research stuff in them the city gives yo warriors to battle.and to play the game fully and get lots of technology you have to play for 50 days never ever get it
4,FOR THE JAGUAR ENTHUSIAST,"As the proud owner of an XKR I wanted to know more about the car and what the Road and Track experts opinions of it were. The publication gave me a different perspective. It told me about the development of the car and its improvements, from year to year. The photographs were beautiful and the explanations of what you were looking at were very good. The book will also support all your boats about your Jag in addition to educating you on the fine points of Jaguar details. It is a worthwhile read for anyone interested in XKs.HBH"
3,No auto focus for Nikon D40,"I bought this lens a few weeks ago and found out that the lens looks different (it looks cheaper in my opinion) then it was pictured on Amazon and RitzCamare web pages. And I can not get ""AutoFocus"" feature on my Nikon D40 (in Amazon weg page and on the box it says it is a AutoFocus lens!). Do not get this lens if you have Nikon D40 and ""AutoFocus"" is a must. And the filter size is 52mm (not 55mm as it says in RitzCamera web page). Other than that, the picture quality of this lens is decent."
5,Couldn't be happier!!,"The estimated arrival dates for this lens were from Oct. 2 to Oct 16...I received it on October 1!! In perfect condition, well packed...I love the lens and the transaction was great. Would def. buy again from this seller. Thanks!"
5,great saw but where is the free blade,This is a great machine you can split your pencil mark. It will cut through 2X4's on edge. mine came with the offer for a free 3/8's Hitachi drill. I got the drill but never got the free finish blade called and griped but still never got the blade. Bur if you have looked and compared with the free shipping it is about the best price out there for the best saw.
2,I *REALLY* wanted to like this saw...,"and for what it costs, I should love it, but I don't. It came with a bowed left fence. After two weeks, I still haven't rec'd the replacement, so I can only make cuts from the right side. The right fence is about an inch tall, i.e. TINY. It slides smooth, and cuts wide stock. The blade it came with is good. The table is also pretty small. The saw I'm replacing is a five-year old 12"" Dewalt (dual bevel but no slider), which I still prefer, sad to say(bigger table and fences). A couple of colleagues have the 12"" Bosch slider, and love it, which at this point I wish I'd bought. Anybody want my Hitachi 10"" slider?"
5,Best saw on the market,"I've used several mitre boxes on the market and none are as detailed as the Hitachi slide. It's the only one I know with a dust shield to keep dust off the bevel guage. To me, the best feature is the soft start. My friend that I work with trimming out houses, has just purchased his third one and will not touch another one because of it's work horse features. This influenced me, then using it for a week sealed my decision. The slide motion is also so very soft, especially when you put a liquid silicone on the shaft, it glides with no effort! I'd recommend it to any serious woodworker needing a quality, dependable tool!"
1,not for a pro!,"This saw is chinese plastic and will not hold up to pro work, don't bother with it.It's not accurate... I have 26 yrs in finish carpentry."
1,Don't waste your time or money,"Whoever wrote the front and back promo covers for this book did not apparently read the book. The book is a very general overview of the fact that there are aging jobs-- in other words, no new information for anyone over the age of 14.The ""up to date salary statistics and earning potential"" information advertised on the cover consists of the author saying that there is a broad range of earning potential.The ""essential advice from the experts"" consists of a reference list at the end.Very poor book-- the worst example I can remember of advertising far exceeding content."
4,"MYSTICAL, MESMERIZING AND MAGICAL.","Since documentaries are featured as extras on many DVDs, there's a growing appetite for this cinematic art form. Criterion is feeding that craving with a series of fascinating glimpses into extraordinary real lives.""ME & ISAAC NEWTON"" is a wonderful companion piece to Ron Howard's critically acclaimed ""A Beautiful Mind,"" answering the question of why science matters. Award-winning director Michael Apted (""Coal Miner's Daughter""), explores the inner worlds of seven scientists in this captivating documentary that looks at the life and influence of a giant who saw the cosamic riddle as evidence of the hand of God who was at the controls of a mechanistic world.By the way, Isaac Newton wrote more on the riddles of Biblical prophecy than he did on mathematics! He was remarkable and so is this great little documentary that is way to short in length and on the facets of this incredib;le man who changed our world views."
3,Reasonably Complete,"Although the book is a fairly good broadrange referencefor celtic mythology, it does come with a few inherent problems.For a start, the author does not give references in his entries. The more and more I do research into celtic mythology and their way of life, the more I find one needs to be able to find references to 'primary sources'.But, for someone begining in the area of celtic studies or someone merely curious, this book is a great start point."
4,Myths and Legends,"Hello,I thought that I would review this book to help people who are interested in it, since there is no description or any other reviews. Well this book is a great resource guide, but that is exactly what it is. A dictionary of people and places in Celtic Myths and Legends. Don't get me wrong though, it is well done. I was just expecting there to be a few stories and some resources as well. :) Okay Bye!"
5,Great book!,I am 15 and I an really interested in celtic stuff and this book is a great guide to all things celtic.
4,good book,i got this book for my birthday with my Kailey doll. i red this book and i thought it was very good. its about a surfer girl Kailey who finds out a movie theater and several other buildings. at firsth kailey is excitied but then she relizes that the tide pools will be destroyed. will she save the ocean with the help of family and friends what goes wrong with kailey's friend? you have to read this book to find out. my recommendation is to also get kailey if she is still available because it is fun to act out the scenes. hope this was helpful to you.
3,Yeah it's good -- but not that good!,"Lot's of 5 star reviews for this book, but I want to disagree some. Yes, there's some very good writing and humor packed into this book. But a lot of it really seemed pointless - like what was the point of having Nellis with his brilliant trick -- only to get blown away? The real plot develops 3/4 into the book, and I'm not sure I even liked the ending. I kept expecting Jeffty to be a better man than he was, and Ridley kept letting me down."
5,It's Depressing that Someone Who Writes So Well...,"is being largely ignored by the reading public. I can't imagine a writer of noir fiction writing anything better than ""Love is a Racket."" And I'm perplexed as to why Ridley isn't as popular as writers such as Patricia Cornwell and others. Or even a fellow African American writer of books set amongst down and out Angelenos -- Walter Mosley...I really have enjoyed ""Love is a Racket,"" and only have 67 more pages to go. John Ridley deserves a far larger audience for his books. So if you're reading this in contemplation of buying ""Love is a Racket,"" get it and all the the other books Ridley writes."
1,love is a racket,i have read 208 pages and i am bored with this book. i don't think i can finish it.
5,The Complete Book of Solitaire and Patience Games,"Detailed instructions, illustrations, terminology, time requirements, and odds in winning of over 225 of the most challenging and fascinating card games ever invented from the famous Canfield Solitaire to Napoleon's Forty Theives. It's here -- everything you need to know about Solitaire and Patience games."
4,Pretty good,I bought this book so I could learn different ways to play solitaire. It has pictures and plenty of instructions. I do wish it had a few more pictures so I could see how they were saying to lay them out but all in all it is pretty good.
3,Very Small Print!,If you are buying this for a Senior please note the printing is VERY small. Actually the whole book is one of those 'pocket size' books and feels and looks really cheap.
5,COF Chehn's Dragon Dance Conditioner,"Smells deliciously wonderful! Great quality product. Leaves hair soft and shiny. I never went back to the popular brands you find at grocery stores after trying COF. It is more expensive, but you'll see why after you start using it on your kids."
5,Lap Top Battery,This battery works great in my lap top. It's performance is everything I was told it would do.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS CD,"This is NOT KRS-One's Kristyle CD. This is a CD put together behind his back. He had no idea that this record was being put out. The REAL Kristyle record, The Kristyle, will be released by KRS-One himself and be available for download on the internet in the near future. Until then, DO NOT GET THIS ALBUM, AS IT IS NOT ENDORSED BY KRS-ONE AS AN ALBUM WORTHY OF HIS NAME.From KRS-One himself: ""They have stuff that I wasn't even putting on the album. I have no idea what's on the album [Koch put together]. I don't know what the artwork looks like, I don't know what the album credits look like, I don't know nothing. What they did was go behind my back and release the album.""So, by my own and KRS-One's own recommendation, AVOID THIS DISC AT ALL COSTS."
3,this man is no quitter,"i think kris names some emcees at one part that he is giving kudos to, that part is very dope. it's a good album."
2,Hit&Miss Set,first of All KRS-One is One of the Greatest Rappers&Story-Tellers Ever&Ain't nobody out now in Rap Can even Hold His Shoe Laces when He breaks things down.having said that&understanding He didn't fully want this Album out He still hasn't knocked me out with a Album all the way through in way over a Decade.He has had some tight Jams&of course His Flow still will just leave you dizzy but the Music&Subject matter are pretty much the same&He hasn't challenged His Full powers as a MC in quite some time.He still has the Words&Flow to Roll you over but Albums like this&others of recent time just don't even begin to do this Man Justice when you remember&Grew up on His Best stuff.but regardless I'll always listen to Him.He truly changed&Flipped the Game.
3,Good But Not Great.,"Good, but Souvlaki *is* a much better produced and cleaner album. The band also sounds more cohesive and ""aware"" of the song parts on that album (probably due to Brian Eno's influence). However, this is still a worthy album. It just doesn't meet the expectations set by Souvlaki and Pygmalion.The standout tracks here, IMHO, are Catch The Breeze, Waves, Celia's Dream, and Brighter.If you're into shoegazer stuff, check out a band called Mira, from Tallahassee, Florida. They do a lovely rendition of MBV's When You Sleep, and definitely have a Slowdive influence."
2,Bad and extra sappy,"Compared to Souvlaki, which I absolutely adore, this album is awful. I really wish I'd chosen to spend my money on Pygmalion, but Just for a Day was a lot cheaper. I highly suggest you bypass this one and get other slowdive stuff instead. I was expecting to like this, but got extremely disappointed instead!"
5,Nick Chaplin - Bass Player,"I am married to ex Bass player Nick Chaplin. I think this was the 2nd best cd they did. My favourite is Souvalaki. The others were pants. If anyone is interested, both Nick and Christian ( ex guitarist) can be contacted on nick.chaplin@sagetetra.com or christian.savill@sagetetra.com"
5,A welcome addition to New Age spirituality reading lists,"Twin Flames: A True Story Of Soul Reunion by Antera (who has been in contact with her spirit guide since she was a small child and who changed her name in 1995 when she received her spiritual name ""Antera"" through meditation) is a powerful, new age memoir of reunion and love that transcends the centuries from antiquity down to the modern day. Divinity, the aid of spirit guides, and an inspirational testimony about the power of relationships fill this moving metaphysical narrative. Thoughtful and thought-provoking, Twin Flames is a welcome addition to New Age spirituality reading lists."
5,Never too far,"I think ""Never too far"" is the best DR album; every song is a story by itself; ""Come in"" makes you feel like in paradise, ""More to love"" makes you cry, ""Never too far"" couldn't be so near to our hearts, ""Fumilayo"" will make you dance.....Dianne is a great artist, is a powerful voice, is a talented woman.thank you so so much."
3,decent,grow big didn't have a seal on it. not sure if the product was contaminated or anything. other two were still sealed and are good to go.
3,"Grow big wasnt sealed, like some others have stated",I have read the reviews and i like some of them do not have a seal on grow big. I hope it wasn't diluted or plain out dyed water but ill go on faith..what other choice do i have besides a lengthy process of reshipping and etc.
5,Good Organic Nutes,I am a fan of fox farm nutrients after using these on my last grow I could see a big difference from the other nutes I was using. I am now using their soluble Tri-pack and it has made my grow even better. Would recommend anything fox farm has they have great products.
4,Bloom Big is my favorite,I got the trio. Out of the three Bloom Big is by far my favorite. I have roses and after using Bloom Big I've seen as many roses as during the first flush of the summer season. I haven't seen quite as big of a difference with Grow Big or Tiger Bloom. I actually burned some of my roses on Tiger Bloom but that might have been my fault with getting the measurements wrong.
2,Way to costly for what you get!,"This stuff does not go very far & seriously i have had better grows with miracle gro to be honest, so a waste of money & time in my book."
2,sketchy,I recently recieved my Nute Trio and discovered one of the bottles wasnt even seeled(no seel under the cap or over the mouth of the bottle) the other two were seeled but the seel wasnt very good(nutrients leaked from the bottles durring shipping). However i decided to go ahead and use them trusting this seller. I will update my opinion later when i see results.
3,"Decent Products, Better Out There","Fox Farm is definitely a good fertilizer manufacturer. Their Light Warrior and Ocean Forest soils are excellent products. That being said, when you compare their nutrient trio base line to other manufacturers similar products, there is much to be desired. I have used Canna, Botanicare, House & Garden (Prefered for Hydro), Earth Juice (Prefered for Soil) and many many more. I have seen average results from FF nutrients. Nothing terrible, I find it runs hot, but not spectacular and that in it's own right has kept me looking for and using other products. Their soluble additive products are worth looking at and can help with harvest figures when used properly."
4,Decent starter set,"These three nutes are a good choice for someone starting out. I especially like the Big Bloom since it's organic. Just remember that you will need more than these three, especially if you use reverse osmosis water. At the very least you will need a Cal Mag product such asBotanicare CAL-MAG Plus Quart. There are many other products that will improve your grow but you could succeed with these three and a cal mag product.I really want to reinforce that you WILL at least need a cal mag product with this set if you use RO water."
5,awesome,"Product works very well, seeing great results already. Not to mention it was cheaper than my local cheapest hydro store. Will buy again!"
1,Teacher and Librarian Reviews Development & Underdevelopment,"After reading and reviewing two books in the Road to Globalization series it is difficult to find anything that I like about these books. The size of the book reminds me of an elementary picture book yet the text seems ""lost in translation."" For example, take the first paragraph of chapter three, ""By this time, the home had long been a principal element of social status."" Using ""By this time,"" to start a chapter is confusing to adults let alone below reading level teenage readers (who the book must be aimed at). By what time? The series is supposed to cover 1800 to 2000, which time?The title would suggest that the focus is poor 3rd world countries vs. rich 1st world countries, but very little cause and effect relationships are discussed. Events of the 30-year period 1945-1975 are rehashed with very little weight given to poor vs. rich. After reading this book the reader has to ask themselves ""what thing of value did that book just say?"""
3,Damaged Package,"Plastic casing has separation from backing which is causing the collector cards to shift, potentially be exposed & not display properly."
1,Watchable only because it is so bad!,"Forget about plot, setting, screen play, or anything else that would weigh a judgment. Meg Tilly's absurd and unintellible accent more than make this movie worth passing over (not to mention the ridiculous, drawn out ending)!"
4,"a reasonable adaptation, and a haunting supernatural film","I read the book before I saw the movie, and I agree with the reviewer who said this movie hits most of the points of the book. The actors are not what I expected -- Desland is a bit too stiff and dorky, but he was in the book too, so he seems reasonably well cast, but Karen is supposed to be unbelievably beautiful and Meg Tilly doesn't seem so to me. The film is slow in parts, but then so is the book. I thought it a great supernatural film, understated and creepy, for those that like horror without a lot of slasher nonsense. I wish they'd put out a DVD edition."
4,"Meg Tilly Was Wonderful- The Movie Didn't Equal The Book, However...","I believe ( unlike so many others ) Meg Tilly's accent was thick, but workable. I found her to be every bit as erotic, haunting, and multi-layered as Richard Adam's character was in his book ( which happens to be one of my favorite ghost stories ever ), and I think that anyone that found Rupert Frazer's portrayal of 'Alan' to be too wooden certainly could not have read the novel. The character was stiff- as written. Meg Tilly always seemed to have an illusive, otherworldly quality about her that made her perfect for the part of the doomed, ethereal 'Karin.'The movie was able to capture a good deal of the book's flavor, though not much of the mounting tension that Adam's so masterfully brought to the novel. It was, however, a quite watchable film."
1,The book was wonderful; the movie was awful,"I read the book and loved it from start to finish - you could understand why the beautiful and brilliant Kathe (not ""Karin"") fell in love with the staid, unhandsome Alan. This movie makes you wonder what she sees in him, and he in her. Meg Tilly is gorgeous to look at, but not at all appealing in this movie. And wasn't the girl supposed to be Danish, not German? Oh well. The movie lacks the suspense, tragedy, and genuine love the book so beautifully described. Sorry - the film stinks."
4,"Lets just face it, this is the best Tenchu game in history","This games is one of those few titles where stealth killing is actualy fun. Tenchu had competant graphics for the time, though ugly by 2012 standards. The controls definately had issues but lets face it, this is the best Tenchu game to date. Tenchu has not alway done well as a franchise but this has its charming moments. Years later, the thing that sticks out most to me is the Soundtrack. There are certani gamse you hang onto for the BGM's. This is one of those games. The over the top stealth kill and trying to unlock certain items is well and good but the music is the thing that always calls me back. This games wonky graphics and play controls were never anything to write home about and only got worse with each consequential sequal and retread. The first one is the best in the series, in my opinion. Priority was never graphics or packaging. It was all about the fun.. and lovely soundtrack."
4,The True Ninja Game,"Over all, I liked the gameplay quite a bit, the environment is a bit messy that's all. Most Activision games I played are liked that for some reasons, but their games are always some of my personal favorites. I dig Ninja stuff and played most of the Ninja games made earlier, but all I have to say none was like this. You can actually stealth and stuff for the first time. Pretty much like Metal Gear's style and I personally think that's where they got the idea from. But overall, they did a good job with storyline, re-playable... I don't know, it's quite a long game and quite time consuming. Anywayz, if you like ninjas, get this. You'll like it at least..."
2,"Simply put, it's just not very good","This game has a lot going for it with plenty of stealthy ninja action. The problem is that the cons get in the way of the pros. For starters, the controls are annoyingly bad. The fighting consists mainly of run up to the guard and mash the attack button and hope something connects. Usually your character will continue attacking even though your not hitting anything, meanwhile your being chopped to death by a guard. Next, the graphics really show the Playstation's age; in other words, they're terrible. More than once I was aiming my grappling hook at a nearby roof, only to watch the entire building I was aiming at disappear. But hey, if pop-up is your thing, you'll be more than satisfied here. One thing I liked was that it was challenging (mainly thanks to the controls). However, there are just too many other good games out there to get to even consider this one. Go get Metal Gear Solid instead."
5,The Sweet Classics,"Playing the original Tenchu brought back some pleasant memories of one of the first stealth games in the business. Great story line that is often copied in the sequels because you don't fix it, if it aint broken."
4,Everying is great but the ending...try it anyway!,"This is a great game.The whole new story is the most attractive thing.Have you ever been an assassin?It maybe a little bit hard at beginning...but will be easy with cheat-codes.Anyway we haven't been assassins,right? Let's enjoy it!"
4,Real enjoyable,"This movie is not the movie ""Bye Bye Brazil"" is, but I really enjoyed it. I enjoyed it for two reasons. First, I have seen ""BBB"" and I can put the two in context. (There is a great visual gag involving satellite dishes that connects to ""BBB"") Second, I have lived in Brazil. I know where Carlos Diegues is coming from.I think Brazilians really believe God is Brazilian. After all, Brazil is Paradise. God's frustration, expressed in this movie, is Brazil's frustration. As emphasized in the movie, Brazil does not suffer from hurricanes, tidal waves, earthquakes, etc. It suffers from people. Yet, this movie does not get bogged down in despair. It's Brazilian! And Brazilian optimism reigns! Despite the misery of the human condition, God's beauty and love make it all worthwhile!Watch this movie, but see ""Bye Bye Brazil"" first."
3,God is Brazilian,I liked the movie but it wasn't the best Brazilian movie I've seen. I like Brazilian movies that show the positive side of Brazilian culture.
1,Trash,I don't know what people see in this piece of trash. It's boring and stupid. I guess it might be alright for a 5-year old child. I took it the day after I wasted my money on it and traded it back in for a real game.
4,Excellent!,"This game was great! I liked it,because some level would open up next.""What's this next level?! I can't wait!""I suggest you buy it.The reason it's four stars,is because it could have been better.It would have if there was some really,really dark chamber,(other than the Hilltop Mausoleum)with ghosts.Other than that,it's great."
4,i love medievil,i loved medievil short tho just like i remeber from child hood.even made my day even made me cry.lol oh my goodness/.
3,"Nice shoe, too pricey","I purchased this shoe to help with joint pain and it has had some positive results. I was hoping for more, though. I don't think it has any more effect than any other high-end shoe would have had. Nice, but I would not likely buy this brand again."
5,Shoes,Spira Men's Classic Leather Walking Shoe is an excellent shoe. It feels good when walking. I don't have as much backache when wearing these shoes.
1,Does not live up to discription,In there ad they claim because of the steel springs the sloes do not compress as much as conventional shoes. I supinate with my right foot and she shoes compressed on the outside a lot on my first use. It's the only time I was able to wear them. They were uncomfortable and gave me ankle pain.
1,"EXPENSIVE, POOR QUALITY","This shoe is basically a gimmick. Very cheaply made, wears out very fast. For the price I was amazed at how poorly constructed it was. I was not impressed with this product at all. A little over a month the sole was wearing down, the top looked very worn, and I think the spring inside broke because the shoe started to lean to one side. I attempted to contact the manufacturer who only told me to return it to the place of purchase. When I told them that it was past 30 days and I couldn't send it back they essentially told me that I was out of luck. I will never buy a shoe made by this company again."
1,majormuffin,I bought these shoes because of all of the hype that they are comfortable. I am on my feet most of the day. I wore them for 2 days and I had to take them off because the shoes only caused pain and agony to my feet. The concept is good about the springs. The reality is that the springs are very hard and have no give. I tried these shoes off and on for a month. I even went to the store and bought padded inserts. The inserts didn't help either. I tried everything I could think of to help make them comfortable. Nothing worked! I just didn't want to throw away a pair of shoes that I had spent so much money on. The bottom line is that I would never buy another pair of Spira shoes.
4,spira shoes,Very comfortable. shipped to my house and arrived sooner than estimated. Saved a lot of money compared to the price at a local outlet. Highly recommend for anyone with foot issues.
2,Don't like,"Doesn't fit the way I want it to. Since I had to wear them and the return policy said they had to be unopened or unused, I cannot return them."
1,To tight sent them back as soon as i tried them on felt like a 2EE i need a 4EEEE,ITried them on and sent them right back.To tight hurt my foot I need a big EEEE width this felt like a 2E
5,Happy walking on Spira's shoes!,"The shoes are terrific for everyday wear, and extremely comfortable for weekend walking. The springs in the soles; how long will they provide ""bounce""?The Amazon affiliate that sells them is efficient and provides excellent service [I had to exchange my initial pair because they were too small.]"
1,Painful to wear.,"I am on my feet 10-12 hours aday at work. I was looking for a pair of shoes that would be comfortable throughout the day. So I bought a pair of Spira Classic men's shoes. After wearing them 3-4 hours, I had to switch back to wearing my old ones. The springs in the front of the shoes began to hurt. I thought at first I needed to give it some time and allow the shoes to break in and to allow the my feet to adjust to the shoes. I then was going to give it a month for the break-in period, but after wearing them for 3-4 hours for 2 days my feet were in very painful. I had to stop wearing them. I then tried wearing them once a week for 3-4 hours. Once again my feet became painful and I had to switch back to my old shoes. I believe the problem with the shoes is in the springs. The springs are much to hard to walk on and that there is no give. I would NOT recommend buying a pair of these shoes."
5,I have mortons neuroma and these shoes help alot!!,"I was diagnosed 5 months ago with mortons neuroma and I have had cortizone shots used inserts and tried just about everything. I decided to try these shoes with the springs because they state on there web site that they work for mortons. I have had them for a few weeks and they have really helped my feet out. My right foot doesnt bother me and my left foot is 80% better. I dont know if these are a cure but they sure make walking a heck of alot less painful. I am 45 with flat feet, 200lbs and on my feet alot."
5,Excellent shoe,"This is an excellent shoe. Especially for persons with knee or foot problems. They provide additional cushioning. However, they are not cheap and their efficacy is somewhat limited as the shoes start wearing out. You'll need to replace the shoes every 1.5 years or so depending upon your usage. Otherwise I highly recommend these shoes."
4,Great shoe for working retail,I work a very physical retail/grocery job and these shoes are great - I have had 3 pairs now. Only flaw would be the inside wears through the fabric at the back of the heel after a few months.
5,love this shoe,walking all day on cement is hard on feet and knees. these shoes make a big differance on how i feel at the end of my work shift. this is my second pair of these shoes and i will buy another pair as backup.
5,Spira Men's Classic Leather walking shoe,I have used Spira Men's Classic Walking Shoes before and have had great experience with them. I liked the shoe performance so I have ordered them again. The inner springs provide a very comfortalbe walk on any surface.
4,A Weak Four Stars,"The highlight of this video is The Diamonds singing Little Darlin' and then joined by Maurice Williams. Williams and The Zodiaks then continue with Stay. The Chiffons sing One Fine Day, a nice song, but I would have rather heard He's So Fine. Both would have been best. The Coasters sing Poison Ivy, but hearing Yakety Yak would have been nice, also. Love Potion # 9 and Devil or Angel by The Clovers were nice additions and the final song Til Then provided a wonderful ending. A worth while video even if you get it for just The Diamonds and Maurice Williams & The Zodiaks. Maybe I'm too picky, but you take what you get when you buy a music video."
4,Realistic Rewards,"Good ideas for those that need inspiration. A handy reference for low budget ideas that really do work. If you've ever underestimated the power of a handwritten note or cup of coffee as a reward, you need to read this book!"
4,The Wendy Chronicles,"My first foray into Wasserstein as a playwright. I've been familiar with her name and story for quite some time, but hadn't read her. So glad I did. This compilation of three Wasserstein pieces began with Uncommon Women and Others, continued with Isn't It Romantic and ended with the incredible Heidi Chronicles. Maybe the plays got better in succession or maybe I just became a more skilled Wasserstein reader as I experienced her more, I'm not sure. So much reflected women's struggles with the world and with themselves. Although I was never a 'Seven Sisters' girl, I remember those same feelings of wanting to take over the world while feeling inadequate to do much of anything. The Heidi Chronicles was a bittersweet end to the compilation, as it ends with Heidi's single-mom-adoption of a little girl and hope for the future, while the contemporary reader knows that Wasserstein herself could only enjoy her single-momness for a few years before dying of lymphoma."
4,Heidi Chronicles and other plays,"Heidi is the girl we all want to grow up and be or for our daughters to grow up and be. She has the strength of character that in no way makes her sacrifice charm and romance. A head turning, thought-provoking, ideal story for all of us. It is something we can achieve even if life passes us a hard lot. This shows that life can be fun at any age."
3,Good and bad,"I like the look of these studs, shiny silver and crystal. Crystal isn't fully glued in on one of them though and I worry it may fall out. Same problem with the studex onyx studs. Granted I bought them from a different store. They do stay in your ears, and don't itch though!"
4,Nice to see Chuck back,It's nice to see Chuck back doing what he does best-writting and performing great music. His playing sounds great(maybe even more expressive than in the past). It's nice to have Jerry Niewood back as well as Grant Geissman and Charles Meeks from the Feels So Good band. Keep up the great music Chuck!
2,Goes Nowhere,"I loved The Rules of the Game and The A'tlante, but this ""Great French Film"" left me cold. The characters are cardboard. The female lead is too old for four young men to fall in love with. Yes, she's smooth and smarter than her suiters, but what 50 year old couldn't outsmart a twenty something.What's with the French thing about life being absurd. If you had to put up with French Socialists, then maybe you would give up hope. With a national GNP growth rate of about 1% for thirty years, you'd think life was absurd too. Take your mimes and do not watch this tiresome film that basically goes nowhere."
2,**,"I rented this after seeing Marlon Brando's comment that it is ""maybe the best picture ever made."" But I didn't like it, and I think perhaps if I'd seen it in its own time, I may have liked it, but it's terribly dated. Not that I would have liked it even so, but, what is sure, I couldn't wait for it to end."
2,The most overrated foreign movie of all time,"I saw this on TCM years ago and i thought what is all the fuss about. I do not like how it glorifies that leaving your wife and kid is swell. The men look more like lady's then the men in this movie that are after her. Also this movie is so long and boring. Don't get me wrong i like foreign films even the ones that are slow like wild strawberries, umberto d and such but this one did nothing for me. Another thing his wife is alot more actrative then the woman he desires. You can tell i did not mention character names well i forgotten them i only seen this moive me once and that was enough. A other thing i need to mentin why is that criterion charges so much for there dvds other dvds are restored as well and they are cheaper and most of chiterion dvds do not even have a whole lot of bonus features."
5,Children of Paradise dvd,"This 2-disc dvd is a classic. If you are any kind of movie fan, you will want it for your collection. Very historic and timeless."
4,love is simple.,"under the conditions of pure magic - a fairytale - i'd find it rather difficult to believe that a person would be unable to enjoy this movie. for soldiers of love, fizzled cynics in contempt against the modern world, and artists interested in exploring - from outside oneself - the metaphysical relationship with his or her muse - i doubt there's a more perfect film than 'children of paradise'.the criterion dvd is loaded with features, though, save for the wonderful and poetic commentary, most of them are completely worthless and unnecessary. they could have done us a lot more favors. perhaps when the next great video medium comes around, the 'children of paradise' release will have more bonus featurettes and what not.but as for now, the transfer is exquisite. the sound is great. and the movie, of course, is perfect."
1,"Great movie, but the blu-ray is shockingly bad.","The new re-master by Pathe is completely sub-par. The image was given a DNR butt-rape, resulting in compromised depth, contrast, detail, and clarity. Virtually no grain is present in the image. I understand that the remastering job was out of Criterion's hands, but I'm still genuinely shocked and DISTURBED that they would release it this way. Without a doubt, the most disappointing blu-ray Criterion has ever put out."
5,Brings back memories,This compilation by Leo Sacks should please all Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes fans from the early 70's. Teddy is at his best and the Gamble and Huff production unbeatable. This CD is highly recommended to anyone who wants to listen to a great group.
1,Does not fit,This seat cover did not fit my small SUV seat. Cannot recommend it for anything but small car seats
2,frustrating,"it's fun to play in little bits, but if I play it for too long it's just maddening. there's almost no story, for one. the controls are imprecise at best, and the battle system manages to be bare-bones and overly difficult at the same time. the 'health' is the gems you collect throughout the levels, but no matter how many you collect, you'll lose them all if you get hit just once. if you get hit on zero 'health', you die. you only get three lives, after which you lose any progress you've made in that level, and start from the beginning. all in all, if you have a lot of patience, you might enjoy this, but if not, I wouldn't reccomend it."
4,It's croc!!,"Croc, what more can you say, it is always a fun game to play when you are sick of the new gen games. Honestly I would rather play the older games than the newer ones. the game play is great, and the story is very good."
3,So much potential!!,"This game has everything it needs to be GREAT! It IS great. I've never played Croc 2, scared off by difficulties in the first one. Yes, I agree, the controls are horrible. I can remember spending 7 minutes climbing platforms only to miss a cage, jump down, take 5 minutes back up, and fall down right before the top. <SCREAM> It made me even madder because the characters are the cutest, you collect things like Spyro and Ty, it's the cutest story, and I WANT to play it so, so badly...but the diificult controls make that impossible. For ""Greatest Hit"" couldn't they have fixed that ONE problem?? If they fix the camera/controls and make Croc 3, I will pre-order it."
3,Croc is O.k. but hard to handle,The story is that the Gobbos ( they look like balls of hair with eyes) found Croc in a basket. The basket was floating in the river. Croc was all by himself so they raised him as their own. Then the Evil Baron Dantinis captured the Gobbos and now Croc must save them. Croc is colorful and the characters are cute. The problem is that Croc is hard to controle. It is almost inposible to get Croc to cross a log without falling off. Also the camera is not moving with Croc. It makes it very hard to see.
3,Fun but Frustrating,"Croc is a nice game but the controls are horrible!The farthest Ihave made it is the ice world.It took me forever to get the stupid key,but I finally found it in the bonus world at the verytop of that world.(At the very end of the world,look up and you'll see a staircase leading up to the key.)The bosses are toohard and the enemies come back to life in less than a minute!!In games like Spyro the Dragon and Crash:Warped the enemies die and don't come back.So even though this game is fun,I'd still recommend Spyro and Crash games instead.They're much better."
2,"Oh, Nostalgia. You betray me again.","Croc: Legend of the Gobbos for the PlayStation should be a very fun game but some key things make it anything but.Plot: The evil Baron Dante invades the peace loving Gobbo Island the crocodile name Croc tries to save the day by stopping the evil Baron Dante. 8/10The plot is a high point in this game as a lot of games have bad storiesSound: This game has a high quality soundtrack and great sound effects. 9/10Gameplay: to control croc is the bad point, the game bad controls make this game bad enough to skip. 3/10Overall: This game is OK, but could have been A LOT better. with its cute and cuddly characters to the beautiful islands This game could have been one of the best and well know PlayStation games, BUT, it is only half that. Oh Nostalgia. You betray me again. 6.6 but for GameSpot's score system 6.5/10"
5,croc is a p.i.m.p,this game is a classic an desearves to be recognized as such i brings me back to my childhood plus its a great time waster an there is always some thing new to find in these older gamesi highly recomend this game
2,I really hate this game,"I got this game a week ago. When I first saw this game I thought I was going to like it. When I popped the c.d in the playstation It was so darn frustrating to control croc. I only went to the dessert world. When I was in the ice world I kept losing cuz u go a long way just to get a key to save a freakin gobbo. Croc for game boy color is much better than the one for playstation. If u r looking for a really good cute, funny, fun, interesting game get Gex: Enter the gecko. What I am tring to tell u is that DON'T GET THIS GAME EVER."
5,A must have for anyone truly interested in EQUAL rights.,"Unfortunately, I don't have time to write the in depth review that this book deserves, but I do want anyone who is contemplating the purchase of this book to BUY IT. This book is a must have for anyone truly interested in EQUAL rights. If you enjoy Warren Farrell, you will love David Thomas. If you see TRUE EQUALITY in the same light that I do, you will never put this book out of arm's reach...and you will read it again...and again...and again.Jeff"
3,Pass,"I watched many Vietnam War movies that came out when this one did. I passed at the time and glad that I did. Not that it is bad, it is just too melodramatic. Sure, a couple blood-and-guts scenes (a bit much then, run-for-the-mill now). But, they don't add anything and we really don't get into the parts. Just too detached."
2,Urrrrrrrrrrgggghhh,"This was probably one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The sight of the box just depresses me. It has almost talked me out of joining the Army.It may be the most realistic Vietnam movie, but the focus of the movie is on all the negative aspects. The troops are a bunch of poor white guys and minorities who are sacrificing their lives to capture a worthless hill, only so the hippies and college kids at home who are too afraid to fight (under the guise of saying it's 'immoral') can spit on them when they return. They deal with racial tensions and friendly fire. What makes it even more senseless is that you never really bond with the characters except to feel sorry for them, partly because you can hardly hear what they're saying. The whole experience of the movie is just depressing. Maybe that was the point.If you're into war movies, this is worth looking into, but otherwise no way."
1,Garbage,"I can't believe anyone actually liked this show. It is full of bad acting and horrible dialouge. If I was to describe this movie with one word it would be ""Cheese""."
2,bad Hamburger,"This movie gets 2 stars and not 1, only because the story is historically accurate. However, The acting, the photograpy and even the sound quality of this movie are all less than impressive.Try ""WE WERE SOLDIERS"" instead."
5,A most Fitting Tribute to the 101st Airborne,"One of the best films about the lives of a Grunt in the Viet Nam War that I have seen. Better than ""Platoon"" and almost up there with ""Once We Were Soldiers"". It shows one of the most horrific fights of the war the most aptly named ""Hamburger Hill"". Why we fought there and how is never really explained but the basic goodness and toughness of our troops has never been showed so well as it was here. Good to go in my book!"
1,What are Region Codes?,I understand this is suppose to be an excellent movie but I was unable to view it because of the regional codes. I would recommend checking this out before order this DVD.
2,THE WEAKEST OF THE LOT,"Although it may have seemed realistic in its day, Hamburger Hill seems weak now in view of the far more realistic ""Saving Private Ryan,"" and the marverlous ""Whwn Trumpets Fade,"" (by all means see this seldom seen competitor to SPR).The actors are all so clean shaven and unconvinvincing. The much ballyhood battle scenes aren't all that great by todays standards."
4,Accurate,"Having done a tour of duty in Vietnam myself I consider Hamburger Hill the most accurate depiction of the uselessness and insanity of the Vietnam War. The acting and production could have been better, but, so what? At least this flick is not terminally pretentious like Oliver Stone's ridiculous platoon."
4,"Excellent, but...","Why the Hell haven't they made a sound track for this movie. It's got tons of songs like when a man loves a woman, and my personal favorite we got to get out of this place. If they want to make more money (who doesn't) they should make a soundtrack. Great movie, ok acting, good combat scenes, and great plot."
4,A BRUTAL BUT OUTSTANDING FILM,"Sadly this gem of a movie is largely overlooked in the Vietnam War film genre, because it's without question one of the best and most realistic portrayals of combat, and men in combat, ever put on film. While several of the actors in this film have since gone on to achieve stardom, at the time it was made, it was essentially a cast of unknowns. The acting here is absolutely topnotch and shows the madness of war in a sometimes preachy but always emotional way. It's deinfitely not a ""feel good"" movie, but if you want a gritty, grim, violent and harshly realistic take on men caught in the hell that is war, then they don't come any better than Hamburger Hill."
2,Wish the Blu-Ray version was created in Region A,"Region B blue is not compatible for Blu-Ray players in the United States. Hamburhill is a great movie, and I have it on regular DVD."
4,Good,"Not as flashy or over-the-top as some other war films, 'Hamburger Hill' is still a solid and worth the watch. What keeps the movie together is the character study and racial tension between the American soldiers. The plot is very thin, but the movie is done well."
2,SLEEPER!,"I don't see what people like about this movie. I found itto be very boring. I liked Full Metal Jacket, Pearl Harbor,and Saving Private Ryan, a whole lot more than this dud!"
3,Pretty Good,"I think this is probably the worst Vietnam movie I have seen,but it is not a bad movie!I mean Platoon,Apocalypse Now and Full Metal Jacket were just better movies!But this movie is not that bad,it does not really try to get you emotional are try to be dramatic,it is just a look at Vietnam.I could not believe are soldiers had to fight just to capture a piece of ground!Anyway the acting is good and it is a pretty good movie but I suggest either Platoon,Apocalypse Now or Full Metal Jacket over this movie.(And I'm really 14)"
1,terrible movie,"this movie was horrible. the acting was atrocious. it was too over dramatic - trying to convey something that wasn't there. like, for instance, when Languilli says at the end, ""don't forget me."" his whole scene was bad, the part was read badly, directed badly, and acted badly. the movie tried too hard to make you feel something for these guys but the problem was that the scenarios didn't have enough time to develop so that you could feel something. overall an absolutely horrible movie."
5,Realisitc action & devastation,"Rakkassans rock! This is my drill sergeant's old unit. He loved this movie and told everybody to buy it. He swore that it was the most accurate portrayal of Vietnam that he had seen. (Could he have been prejudiced because he was there? We Eagles tend to be prejudiced for our own.)When I watched it the first couple of times, I was reduced to tears. Geez, those guys went through hell, but never gave up their fighting spirit or determination to win - even when facing a no-win political situation! My drill once commented that after being at HH, none of the survivors will go to hell because the devil knows they'll take over! These are the ultimate fighting men on a most horrendous mission.Get this movie. Encourage your local history teachers to utilize it in their classrooms. It ain't pretty, but war never is."
3,"Disappointed , grainny picture quality","I ordered this reg.B bd thought it for best picture quality, but instead below my expectationnow I preferred dvd hopefully better pict. than this bd reg.Bdisappointed ."
4,Great Film--Deserves More Attention and Respect,"This film is lesser known than some of the other Vietnam filmsof the 1980's but it deserves a greater amount of respect givenit's quality. The action keeps you interested but the characterskeep you involved in the plot, as you get to know them on a personal level. You'll be pulled in by the struggles of Beanstock, Languilli, and Doc. A great film that deserves morerespect and attention. Highly recommended."
2,Not so good,"I remember seeing this movie in cinema long ago and couldn't remeber too much about it other than I didn't like it too much. That being said there are a few other movies that have become much better as I have matured but this one is not among them. Seeing how high others here have rated it I decided to give it another chance and bought it, to my disappointment. I wouldn't go so far as saying it is bad, it is simply mediocore. The story is full of steriotype situations and the battle scenes have a low budget feel."
1,Whong Region,The Blu-Ray product I received would not plat as it was meant for Region B. I live in Region A. The good old USA. I returned the item and am waiting for a credit to my credit card.
1,"Could not see the dvd, did not play","Could not play the dvd ""Hamburger Hill"". Tried playing in three different dvd players and all I received was ""Wrong Region"". Went online and found out that North America is region 2 and all others are region 1. Don't know where this dvd originated.Hamburger Hill (20th Anniversary Edition)"
3,Hamburger Hill,It was a fairly good movie but it had no point really and it also had way too much cursing in it. I would rate it 3 stars.
1,Region B dvd's from the UK,"the blu ray dvd I received was a British made version. It will not play on a player here in the United States. I have been told I can return it for a refund, but they did not instruct me as to where I have to send it. I am very disappointed with Amazon for not being aware a situation such as this can happen. I can only recommend to anyone that they beware if a requested dvd is going to come from the UK."
2,"Pales in comparison to Platoon, very poor audio and f/x.","I bought this movie expecting much more than I got out of it. The audio was so poor I had to alter the volume constantly throughout the movie. The special f/x(or lack thereof) were horrible, the explosions looked like firecrackers. The acting was nothing to speak of either, with poor dialog and emotions throughout. I give the movie 2 stars(instead of one) only because it seemed to be a faithful rendition of the Vietnam experience."
2,Overrated,"This movie has been praised for it's technical depictions, and indeed the guns, uniforms and sounds of battle are quite realistic.The problem is that everything that goes into making a movie; dialog, plotting, pace, acting, and especially directing, are all terrible. This makes the film seem quite unrealistic, with dialog composed with authentic slang, but with the atmosphere of a profane elementary school play from 1969.I would also note that beyond the problems created by the lack of moviemaking skill plentifully in evidence, the movie tries to draw a heroic message not just from the men, but from a war that scarcely deserves it."
1,Read the region,"useless, I did follow thru on what region B meant. DVD is useless for me. would not buy again. READ fine print"
3,GQ Magazine on Film,"I wouldn't dream of arguing with veterans who see this film as realistic. I defer to their authority and expertise absolutely. What strikes me about this picture, though, is the rather unrealistic depiction of males as shown in the picture. My sense of demographic sampling suggests that it would be highly unlikely to find such unusually handsome fellas in the same place and time, anywhere but in Venice, California on muscle beach or maybe in a gay bar on Santa Monica Boulevard on Saturday night. With their chiseled cheeks and cleft chins, these guys are just not what I would expect to find lying on their backs, working on a broken down Jeep in a war zone. I wasn't there, but I'd wager that central casting worked hard to assemble this cast of fashion models. All power to them, mind you, my point simply being that ""reality"" is not what comes to my mind when I see films like this."
4,Graphic and gripping,"Everything that has been said about this film has already been covered in the reviews, but what happened after I showed this to a group of adult students is just as telling. After watching the film, a quiet, almost never awake student (you know the type) raised his hand and asked why I'd show a film where nearly everyone dies. Another student, a vet, simply responded, ""that's war."" It led to the best group discussion I've had on the subject in many semesters."
4,"Fast delivery, good price","My son wanted all 3 Bionicle dvds, but The Mask of Light is too expensive...He hasn't gotten this yet bc his b'day isn't until December. But the price I paid & the speed at which it was received were excellent!"
4,Bionicle 3 - Web of Shadows,My son has watched this movie numerous times and he enjoys it just as much as the first time. A must have for all series Bionicle collectors.
3,Was a gift,"This item was a requested gift for a family member, and I haven't seen the movie. It arrived on time and was as shown."
2,worst bionicle movie yet,My son told me what to write. this movie SUCKS! It was the worst i hate it! it has pretty good grapics though. I recommend boinicle 2 legends of metru nui.
4,Mayo Clinic on Alzheimer's Disease,helpful for a friend whose mother has Alzheimer's. had found this book at the library and then later was able to find it on Amazon to get for my friend.
3,Mayo Clinic & Alzheimer's,"A good read. Typical clinical look at Alzheimer's. Don't rely totally on this book, but get others to read for some different perspectives."
4,Very helpful book,"This book contains not only the latest medical and scientific information on the physical aspects of Alzheimer's, but a ""what to do if"" section that offers suggestions when specific behavioral problems are encountered. For example, what can the caregiver do when the Alzheimer's patient does not wish to bathe, change clothes for a week, go to the doctors, etc.? This book relieves some of the stress of caring for a person with Alzheimer's."
2,Prosecutors have all the power,"A confusing format which alternates between State V Schilling, a trial, and the author's routine cases. The reader loses the impact of the Schilling trial as his attention is constantly being refocused to life in the trenches and the Schilling case is not relevant to the other chapters. The author relates his attempt to send a petty criminal to prison for 4 years for stealing $1 and uses the example as an indictment of the legal system, however it should have presented an ethical problem. The book lacks excitement but could be a guide for those unfamiliar with the legal system. The volume contains many facts, some of which are interesting, but they are never pulled together to make a meaningful statement. It saddened me to read about prosecutors attempting to missuse the system to gain maximum time for defendants with little regard to the facts of each case and whether the punishment would benefit society or the defendant."
1,Shame on the bootleggers,"This is NOT a live album... it is an unauthorized, low-quality sound board bootleg. Two good reasons not to buy it: (1) the sound quality is fair at best, and often poor, and (2) Ronnie Montrose doesn't earn a dime from it. The money all goes to the thieves who are trying to pass this off as an authorized issue. Buyer beware!"
1,Concert rip off classics,The other reviewer speaks the truth about royalties. Ronnie and the band get nothing. I have heard the entire concert classics series is this way. Support the artists by not buying this product.
5,soooooooooo yummy!!!!,love it!i usually like top ramen or cup 'o noodles.. but this has SO much more flavor! it's super easy to make and i can get it at an ethnic store 3 for a $1!i wouldn't buy it on here for this price.
5,Quelle Joie!,"Ooh-la-la. This is a delightful gift for the friend who has a decent elementary grasp on the French language and a rolicking sense of humour. Written with great lingusitic dexterity, both in French aan in English, it will be treasured for years to come.Excerpt: <<So you think that suffixes are just another boring little grammatical item? Not in French, where some are invested with great power. The French, with their superiority complex, make much use of suffixes to express contempt and belittlement. Here are the basic ones, with a few examples of each... (EXAMPLES FOLLOW)>>"
2,"funny, but somewhat insulting","I bought this book for my husband, as I am french I thought he could learn some expression. And I laugh for some of the things it says, but I also found it full of cliches, and somewhat insulting sometimes. There as some useful expressions in it though, but i can't say that my husband has been learning them or using them, yet."
3,this is fine,"I got it for my teen, and it was a huge hit. LOTS of R rated phrases and words. Be warned! Still it was good for fun and some of it might be useful to know."
5,Wonder Tool,"Hitachi C10FSH 10-Inch Sliding Compound Miter Saw with LaserThis miter saw is probably way beyond my needs since I am not a contractor, but it is a superb tool. The laser light makes cutting precise angles a breeze. I attached the saw to a 3/4"" plywood table top and then fastened the plywood to a ryobi miter saw stand. The saw accurately cuts through 2x4's as easily as it cuts moulding."
4,Would buy again,"I've owned this saw for over 2 years and use it almost daily. It works great, I'm glad I bought it. The long throw makes building bookcases and other shallow cabinets easier.I have 3 complaints though: 1) The handle is vertical, not horizontal, and is for right-handed use (its difficult to use the trigger release with the left hand); 2) This saw is screaming for a dual laser setup and I have yet to find one (haven't looked recently though); & 3) Its extremely difficult to set it up for a perfect cut, especially at the far end of it slide (but that is a common complaint for sliding miter saws).But none of these are deal-breakers for me and I would buy it again."
2,"sorry that I sold my old Hitachi 10"", it was made is Japan.","I am very disappointed how cheaply this Hitachi 10"" is made. It is made in China, not in Japan like my old saw. My old saw was working fine after many years, and I wanted the new laser and since I have money to spent on new tools now, I sold my old saw last week and ordered a new one, but boy was I disappointed. I am from China and I know quality when I see it and this saw made in China does not live up to Hitachi's reputation. Returning to Amazon tomorrow and maybe I will order a Makita instead."
5,WOW what a saw!,"I've used the 8"" model of this saw for years, but this is one fine saw! Took it out of the box this morning and it was dead on accurate out of the box. I need to tweak the laser (or just read the manual on how to use it), but it is a smooth cutting saw. Nice blade on it--didn't even have to buy a better blade for a decent cut. Quiet, smooth action. Can't wait to start cutting crown moulding with it. I'm impressed!"
4,Works good,"I've read many reviews about the packaging but Amazon customer service assured me it's guaranteed. So when I received the ""Hitachi C10FSH 10-Inch Sliding Compound Miter Saw with Laser"" I really inspected carefully and took pictures. Found no damage, fences were square. The only the problem was the optional right side ""Hitachi 321387 Sub-fence for C10FSH and C10FSB"" because Hitachi doesn't include this. It's held in by 2 large metal dowel pins and tightens down with a set screw. There's an 1/8"" play at the top of the fence without tightening down the setscrew. After tightening down the set screw, the sub-fence isn't square/level to the other fence on the left side. I've seen this problem written in the past reviews. So I have a fix for that. I added brass shims in the dowel pin hole. I used brass shims because it's a soft metal and will contour to the round hole and they sell different thickness of brass strips.[...]"
3,Supersaw!,"As a finish carpenter maximizing time coupled with quality is is paramount. The laser is single greatest feature saving you from the ""double cut effect"" of looking where the blade drops before each cut. The only gripes are the detents on bevel cuts... there are none, except at the 90 and 45 degrees angles. For crown moulding.. the marks are there but no detents for beveling and the angle lock is in the back unlike the new Delta which are in front.The electronic start/brake is very smooth.It miters at 45 degrees left and over 50 degrees right. Both Hitachi blades provide excellent finishes and the detentes work cleanly. It's not a light piece of equipment and after lugging it around from truck to jobsite purchasing a miter stand with wheels is a must. The only other piece with a laser on a miter is the 12' Rigid. Lowe's also carries this locally and is a little cheaper but Amazon shipped free to the doorstep with no tax."
4,"Great Saw, terribly packed","The saw is fantastic. Slide is smooth and all adjustments are accurate. Best 10"" sliding compund miter for the money by far. It was shiped with nearly NO packing material and arrived with a piece of the handle broken from transit, otherwise would have been 5 stars."
1,"Do Not Buy, Made in China","Do not buy this saw, it is made in China. You can get one that is made in Japan, quality is noticeably different just by placing the two saws side by side."
3,slides have to much slop,i got my new hitachi a bout a week ago and toot it to work yesterday i am cutting 1x8 v rustic cedar siding if you drop the blade at the back of the board and pull it up than pull the saw back and cut from the front there is a descrepency of a 64th plus where the two cuts meet the rails are adjusted as tight as they can be if i tighten them any more it wont slide so i am going to send it back it was not damaged at all in shipping
2,Good but flawed,"This saw works great, for about a week. We've gone through four of these in the past month, all with the same problem, the positive stops on the miter wear out. The one on display at my local Mega-hardware store works fine after what I assume is constant daily abuse by tire-kickers. But ours die in one week. The saw is fantastic otherwise, beautifiul smooth cuts with no blade wobble, the laser has spoiled me, and it doesn't jerk on start/stop. If Hitachi could just make the stops more robust this saw would be a 5 star hands down."
4,Up there with the best,"I have owned this saw for about a year and find it to be a top quality saw. I have the 8"" also and that has been a great saw. the degrees are still a little hard to read (very difficult on the 8"") and I find that to be my major complaint. I fold up the rubber dust flap and then the laser line will show up as you cut. I have found the laser line impossible to see while using the saw outdoors on a sunny day. The saw cuts great, and I have found the angles to be dead on out of the box. I also own the dewalt 12"" slide compound, and except for the extra cutting capacity, I would rate the Hitachi over it. This one is a keeper!"
5,another great hitachi product,"I must say that I am getting fond of Hitachi tools. Got this saw for some moulding projects I have going and from the very start I could tell it's quality. Let me just say that the packing leaves something to be desired. The first one I got was brutally damaged from the slide rails sticking out of the box which made the saw cut out of whack. Credit to Amazon for quickly shipping a new one with no problems. The new one came fine, is square, and cuts great. The laser is adjustable for sides and spot on, the slide is smooth, and the motor has a nice start with constant RPM's. Once again as with other Hitachi products this has external brushes that can be changed for longevity. For the price which included a free Hitachi carbide finishing blade and a 16 guage nailer you just can't beat it. All in all I recommend."
5,tool for my husband,I purchased this tool for my husband when he started his handyman business and it is still working great. He even showed me how to use it and I helped him build a deck and put up some siding on a side job.
4,C10fsh,"The saw set up easily and functions well. Only problem was with laser and getting it to align properly, it still doesn't. I gave up on this since I never had a laser before and will do fine without it."
2,Quality has gone down,"I have been a using some version of the Hitachi slide compound since 1994 . Have used several if not all of the 10"" slide compound and the lastest version has left me VERY dissapointed. I've worn out (due to everyday use over three yrs each.) 4 or more. The first one shipped was a open box one and the saw was bent/twisted at the up/down pivot. No way to square it. Second one was new and is going back tomarrow beacuse the bevel press pin is not seated correctly and cracked the casting(poor quality control) Also the rear fences will not align without elongating the bolt holes in the fences themselves.Love the saw for it's features but since being made in China I believe quality control has TANKED.Amazon has been great in replacements and I don't falt them in anyway. Hitachi just needs to get their act together."
4,woodworker,I am happy with the saw. It runs well and cuts acurately. As far the finish it has a rough spot on the base but not really anything to complain about.I am in agreement with many that rated the saw in the view that the laser is worthless. It needs to be on when the saw is cutting and it dosent and it needs to indicate the side of the blade (Preferebly the left side of the blade for me) and the best I could adjust it was the right hand side of the blade or the center of the blade. It wouldnt adjust far enough to the left to show the left side of the blade.The way the motor is arranged it apperars to be belt driven which is a plus.I really like the saw and would buy another one but not the laser option.PHM
4,Missing Power Drill that was promised with purchase,Saw is great however Hitachi promised a power drill with purchase and never fullfilled. When I contacted the company they didnt know if the order would ever be filled this was 6 months ago as of Feb 27th 2004
1,VENDOR SELLING RTN OR DAMAGED ITEMS,"I AM A FINISH CARPENTER FOR HIGH END CUSTOMERS. THE FIRST SAW I RECEIVED FROM THIS VENDOR HAD BEEN DROPPED AT LEAST ONCE AND COULDN'T PRODUCE MITRES. THE SECOND SAW RECEIVED HAS A PROBLEM WITH THE BLADE AND ATTACHMENT MAKING THE SAW WOBBLE. EVEN AFTER REPLACING THE BLADE WITH A NEW ONE, IT STILL WOBBLES.WITH A TIME PENALTY ON THIS PROJECT, I WILL RECEIVE AN INVOICE FOR HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS IN PENALTIES.AT THIS POINT, I WANT MY MONEY BACK!"
2,Bad Shipping,"It was shipped in a box with no peanuts, wadded paper, or any kind of filler or padding. the box was mangled so badly I had to take a picture I have no way of sending. The top was folded over and partially taped with some cellophane with parts of the saw sticking out. The few accessories were loose in the box, I don't know if any fell out through the holes in the top."
5,This saw can't be beat for the price,Bought this saw to replace one (different make) that broke. What an improvement. This saw was dead on right out of the box. Saw is built very well and very easy to use. The add on miter guides are a great addition if doing alot of crown molding since the ones that come with it are rather small. Saw has plenty of power to handle 2x8 material with no problem. This saw is great for all around remodel work from framing to cabinet trim and crown molding.
3,It must be bad luck!!,"I bought this Hitachi miter saw after reading all of the positive reviews and the experience I've had with other Hitachi miter saws in the past. Well, I don't know what to say except that I must have bad luck. The first saw arrived and, when I opened the box, I found the whole motor housing shattered and the inside of the box damaged. It was clearly damaged in transit and perhaps Hitachi needs to put a little more protection around the contents. Amazon promptly replaced it (kudos to Amazon!!). The second miter saw arrived and this one has a problem with the blade guard. It retracts when making the cut; but doesn't drop back down when the cut is finished. There is also an unusual amount of slop in the arm that retracts the guard. Maybe this is part of the problem. Anyway, saw #2 is now on its way back to Amazon and I think, at this time, I will take a pass on saw #3"
2,Not one of my favorites,"I have a lot of Nicole Jordan's books, and I can safely say I am a huge fan, but this book was not up to par. The main character was a big baby, that never stood up for herself, unless she was trying to run away from someone or something. Jason the leading man should have left her long before the end. The book went around and around, and would never have been as long as it was if the girl wasn't so stupid.Seriously if you are looking for a Nicole Jordan book, look for a different one."
3,.....too long??,"I loved the story, and I so enjoyed the hero, i wish more man were as understanding. but I felt that the story kept going when it should have ended many chapters ago. over all I liked the book, I'm more then willing to give ms.Jordan's other book a try!"
1,Desire And Dcepeption,I am 60% into this book and not sure I can stand to finish it! Character Lauren is pathetic. Jason is obsessed and I have difficult time understanding why! If I finish it I will write 2nd review.Barbara Boyle/CA.
3,More of a son's fond tribute than a documentary,"I found this to be a loving but oddly incomplete biography of Sven Nyquist by his son, Carl-Gustav (Erland Josephson is the film's narrator). It's a shame that the great cinematographer has been silenced by his aphasia; the parade of on-camera interviews must serve as a substitute for what Nyquist cannot say for himself, and they are a great testament to the influence of his talent on several generations of actors and directors. This short film (75 minutes) is filled with many family photos and rare on-set stills. There are also clips from a haphazard array of films, strangely uncredited, and it is left a great deal on the interviews (Bergman, Ullman, Polanski and many others) to discuss his technique and the effect of light on Mr. Nyquist's work. This is obviously a son's tribute to his father, and enjoyable, but anyone looking for more film-by-film analysis should look elsewhere."
3,So sad on so many levels,"This was well acted and I loved the two leads, did I love the story, it was okay... I felt like I'd seen it many times before and even though there is a twist I saw it coming a mile away. Hopefully it won't be as obvious to everyone as that clearly makes this more mundane. Would I watch it again, no...do I resent having paid for it... no. I can't say that for a lot of the things I have paid to watch here on Amazon."
2,This stinks.,"I really like the song ""Superman"" but have only heard the REM version. Unfortunately, Superman is the only decent song on this boring, fluffy album. If you are into really, really light sixties pop (think ""Up Up and Away""), you'll probably get a kick out of this. I was really disappointed."
5,A great collector's item.,I have all of the Spyro games that have been released for the Playstation 2. This is a must have for anyone who loves this series. This purple dragon is here to stay.
